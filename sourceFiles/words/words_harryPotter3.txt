Harry
Potter
and
the
Prisoner
Azkaban
Rowling
CHAPTER
ONE
OWL
POST
Harry
Potter
was
highly
unusual
boy
many
ways
For
one
thing
hated
the
summer
holidays
more
than
any
other
time
year
For
another
really
wanted
his
homework
but
was
forced
secret
the
dead
night
And
also
happened
wizard
was
nearly
midnight
and
was
lying
his
stomach
bed
the
blankets
drawn
right
over
his
head
like
tent
flashlight
one
hand
and
large
leather
bound
book
History
Magic
Bathilda
Bagshot
propped
open
against
the
pillow
Harry
moved
the
tip
his
eagle
feather
quill
down
the
page
frowning
looked
for
something
that
would
help
him
write
his
essay
Witch
Burning
the
Fourteenth
Century
Was
Completely
Pointless
discuss
The
quill
paused
the
top
likely
looking
paragraph
Harry
Pushed
his
round
glasses
the
bridge
his
nose
moved
his
flashlight
closer
the
book
and
read
Non
magic
people
more
commonly
known
Muggles
were
particularly
afraid
magic
medieval
times
but
not
very
good
recognizing
the
rare
occasion
that
they
did
catch
real
witch
wizard
burning
had
effect
whatsoever
The
witch
wizard
would
perform
basic
Flame
Freezing
Charm
and
then
pretend
shriek
with
pain
while
enjoying
gentle
tickling
sensation
Indeed
Wendelin
the
Weird
enjoyed
being
burned
much
that
she
allowed
herself
caught
less
than
fortyseven
times
various
disguises
Harry
put
his
quill
between
his
teeth
and
reached
underneath
his
pillow
for
his
ink
bottle
and
roll
parchment
Slowly
and
very
carefully
unscrewed
the
ink
bottle
dipped
his
quill
into
and
began
write
pausing
every
now
and
then
listen
because
any
the
Dursleys
heard
the
scratching
his
quill
their
way
the
bathroom
probably
find
himself
locked
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
for
the
rest
the
summer
The
Dursley
family
number
four
Privet
Drive
was
the
reason
that
Harry
never
enjoyed
his
summer
holidays
Uncle
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia
and
their
son
Dudley
were
Harry
only
living
relatives
They
were
Muggles
and
they
had
very
medieval
attitude
toward
magic
Harry
dead
parents
who
had
been
witch
and
wizard
themselves
were
never
mentioned
under
the
Dursleys
roof
For
years
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
had
hoped
that
they
kept
Harry
downtrodden
possible
they
would
able
squash
the
magic
out
him
their
fury
they
had
been
unsuccessful
These
days
they
lived
terror
anyone
finding
out
that
Harry
had
spent
most
the
last
two
years
Hogwarts
School
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
The
most
they
could
however
was
lock
away
Harry
spellbooks
wand
cauldron
and
broomstick
the
start
the
summer
break
and
forbid
him
talk
the
neighbors
This
separation
from
his
spellbooks
had
been
real
problem
for
Harry
because
his
teachers
Hogwarts
had
given
him
lot
holiday
work
One
the
essays
particularly
nasty
one
about
shrinking
potions
was
for
Harry
least
favorite
teacher
Professor
Snape
who
would
delighted
have
excuse
give
Harry
detention
for
month
Harry
had
therefore
seized
his
chance
the
first
week
the
holidays
While
Uncle
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
had
gone
out
into
the
front
garden
admire
Uncle
Vernon
new
company
car
very
loud
voices
that
the
rest
the
street
would
notice
too
Harry
had
crept
downstairs
picked
the
lock
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
grabbed
some
his
books
and
hidden
them
his
bedroom
long
didn
leave
spots
ink
the
sheets
the
Dursleys
need
never
know
that
was
studying
magic
night
Harry
was
particularly
keen
avoid
trouble
with
his
aunt
and
uncle
the
moment
they
were
already
especially
bad
mood
with
him
all
because
received
telephone
call
from
fellow
wizard
one
week
into
the
school
vacation
Ron
Weasley
who
was
one
Harry
best
friends
Hogwarts
came
from
whole
family
wizards
This
meant
that
knew
lot
things
Harry
didn
but
had
never
used
telephone
before
Most
unluckily
had
been
Uncle
Vernon
who
had
answered
the
call
Vernon
Dursley
speaking
Harry
who
happened
the
room
the
time
froze
heard
Ron
voice
answer
HELLO
HELLO
CAN
YOU
HEAR
WANT
TALK
HARRY
POTTER
Ron
was
yelling
loudly
that
Uncle
Vernon
jumped
and
held
the
receiver
foot
away
from
his
ear
staring
with
expression
mingled
fury
and
alarm
WHO
THIS
roared
the
direction
the
mouthpiece
WHO
ARE
YOU
RON
WEASLEY
Ron
bellowed
back
though
and
Uncle
Vernon
were
speaking
from
opposite
ends
football
field
FRIEND
HARRY
FROM
SCHOOL
Uncle
Vernon
small
eyes
swiveled
around
Harry
who
was
rooted
the
spot
THERE
HARRY
POTTER
HERE
roared
now
holding
the
receiver
arm
length
though
frightened
might
explode
DON
KNOW
WHAT
SCHOOL
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
NEVER
CONTACT
AGAIN
DON
YOU
COME
NEAR
FAMILY
And
threw
the
receiver
back
onto
the
telephone
dropping
poisonous
spider
The
fight
that
had
followed
had
been
one
the
worst
ever
HOW
DARE
YOU
GIVE
THIS
NUMBER
PEOPLE
LIKE
PEOPLE
LIKE
YOU
Uncle
Vernon
had
roared
spraying
Harry
with
spit
Ron
obviously
realized
that
gotten
Harry
into
trouble
because
hadn
called
again
Harry
other
best
friend
from
Hogwarts
Hermione
Granger
hadn
been
touch
either
Harry
suspected
that
Ron
had
warned
Hermione
not
call
which
was
pity
because
Hermione
the
cleverest
witch
Harry
year
had
Muggle
parents
knew
perfectly
well
how
use
telephone
and
would
probably
have
had
enough
sense
not
say
that
she
went
Hogwarts
Harry
had
had
word
from
any
his
wizarding
friends
for
five
long
weeks
and
this
summer
was
turning
out
almost
bad
the
last
one
There
was
just
one
very
small
improvement
after
swearing
that
wouldn
use
her
send
letters
any
his
friends
Harry
had
been
allowed
let
his
owl
Hedwig
out
night
Uncle
Vernon
had
given
because
the
racket
Hedwig
made
she
was
locked
her
cage
all
the
time
Harry
finished
writing
about
Wendelin
the
Weird
and
paused
listen
again
The
silence
the
dark
house
was
broken
only
the
distant
grunting
snores
his
enormous
cousin
Dudley
must
very
late
Harry
thought
His
eyes
were
itching
with
tiredness
Perhaps
finish
this
essay
tomorrow
night
replaced
the
top
the
ink
bottle
pulled
old
pillowcase
from
under
his
bed
put
the
flashlight
History
Magic
his
essay
quill
and
ink
inside
got
out
bed
and
hid
the
lot
under
loose
floorboard
under
his
bed
Then
stood
stretched
and
checked
the
time
the
luminous
alarm
clock
his
bedside
table
was
one
clock
the
morning
Harry
stomach
gave
funny
jolt
had
been
thirteen
years
old
without
realizing
for
whole
hour
Yet
another
unusual
thing
about
Harry
was
how
little
looked
forward
his
birthdays
had
never
received
birthday
card
his
life
The
Dursleys
had
completely
ignored
his
last
two
birthdays
and
had
reason
suppose
they
would
remember
this
one
Harry
walked
across
the
dark
room
past
Hedwig
large
empty
cage
the
open
window
leaned
the
sill
the
cool
night
air
pleasant
his
face
after
long
time
under
the
blankets
Hedwig
had
been
absent
for
two
nights
now
Harry
wasn
worried
about
her
she
been
gone
this
long
before
But
hoped
she
back
soon
she
was
the
only
living
creature
this
house
who
didn
flinch
the
sight
him
Harry
though
still
rather
small
and
skinny
for
his
age
had
grown
few
inches
over
the
last
year
His
jet
black
hair
however
was
just
always
had
been
stubbornly
untidy
whatever
did
The
eyes
behind
his
glasses
were
bright
green
and
his
forehead
clearly
visible
through
his
hair
was
thin
scar
shaped
like
bolt
lightning
all
the
unusual
things
about
Harry
this
scar
was
the
most
extraordinary
all
was
not
the
Dursleys
had
pretended
for
ten
years
souvenir
the
car
crash
that
had
killed
Harry
parents
because
Lily
and
James
Potter
had
not
died
car
crash
They
had
been
murdered
murdered
the
most
feared
Dark
wizard
for
hundred
years
Lord
Voldemort
Harry
had
escaped
from
the
same
attack
with
nothing
more
than
scar
his
forehead
where
Voldemort
curse
instead
killing
him
had
rebounded
upon
its
originator
Barely
alive
Voldemort
had
fled
But
Harry
had
come
face
face
with
him
Hogwarts
Remembering
their
last
meeting
stood
the
dark
window
Harry
had
admit
was
lucky
even
have
reached
his
thirteenth
birthday
scanned
the
starry
sky
for
sign
Hedwig
perhaps
soaring
back
him
with
dead
mouse
dangling
from
her
beak
expecting
praise
Gazing
absently
over
the
rooftops
was
few
seconds
before
Harry
realized
what
was
seeing
Silhouetted
against
the
golden
moon
and
growing
larger
every
moment
was
large
strangely
lopsided
creature
and
was
flapping
Harry
direction
stood
quite
still
watching
sink
lower
and
lower
For
split
second
hesitated
his
hand
the
window
latch
wondering
whether
slam
shut
But
then
the
bizarre
creature
soared
over
one
the
street
lamps
Privet
Drive
and
Harry
realizing
what
was
leapt
aside
Through
the
window
soared
three
owls
two
them
holding
the
third
which
appeared
unconscious
They
landed
with
soft
flump
Harry
bed
and
the
middle
owl
which
was
large
and
gray
keeled
right
over
and
lay
motionless
There
was
large
package
tied
its
legs
Harry
recognized
the
unconscious
owl
once
his
name
was
Errol
and
belonged
the
Weasley
family
Harry
dashed
the
bed
untied
the
cords
around
Errol
legs
took
off
the
parcel
and
then
carried
Errol
Hedwig
cage
Errol
opened
one
bleary
eye
gave
feeble
hoot
thanks
and
began
gulp
some
water
Harry
turned
back
the
remaining
owls
One
them
the
large
snowy
female
was
his
own
Hedwig
She
too
was
carrying
parcel
and
looked
extremely
pleased
with
herself
She
gave
Harry
affectionate
nip
with
her
beak
removed
her
burden
then
flew
across
the
room
join
Errol
Harry
didn
recognize
the
third
owl
handsome
tawny
one
but
knew
once
where
had
come
from
because
addition
third
package
was
carrying
letter
bearing
the
Hogwarts
crest
When
Harry
relieved
this
owl
its
burden
ruffled
its
feathers
importantly
stretched
its
wings
and
took
off
through
the
window
into
the
night
Harry
sat
down
his
bed
and
grabbed
Errol
package
ripped
off
the
brown
paper
and
discovered
present
wrapped
gold
and
his
first
ever
birthday
card
Fingers
trembling
slightly
opened
the
envelope
Two
pieces
paper
fell
out
letter
and
newspaper
clipping
The
clipping
had
clearly
come
out
the
wizarding
newspaper
the
Daily
Prophet
because
the
people
the
black
and
white
picture
were
moving
Harry
picked
the
clipping
smoothed
out
and
read

spread
across

neat

Harry
now
turned
his

and
unwrapped
Inside

Apart
from
his
friends
the
thing
that
Harry
missed
most
about
Hogwarts
was
Quidditch
the
most
popular
sport
the
magical
world
highly
dangerous
very
exciting
and
played
broomsticks
Harry
happened
very
good
Quidditch
player
had
been
the
youngest
person
century
picked
for
one
the
Hogwarts
House
teams
One
Harry
most
prized
possessions
was
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
racing
broom
Harry
put
the
leather
case
aside
and
picked
his
last
parcel
recognized
the
untidy
scrawl
the
brown
paper
once
this
was
from
Hagrid
the
Hogwarts
gamekeeper
tore
off
the
top
layer
paper
and
glimpsed
something
green
and
leathery
but
before
could
unwrap
properly
the
parcel
gave
strange
quiver
and
whatever
was
inside
snapped
loudly
though
had
jaws
Harry
froze
knew
that
Hagrid
would
never
send
him
anything
dangerous
purpose
but
then
Hagrid
didn
have
normal
person
view
what
was
dangerous
Hagrid
had
been
known
befriend
giant
spiders
buy
vicious
three
headed
dogs
from
men
pubs
and
sneak
illegal
dragon
eggs
into
his
cabin
Harry
poked
the
parcel
nervously
snapped
loudly
again
Harry
reached
for
the
lamp
his
bedside
table
gripped
firmly
one
hand
and
raised
over
his
head
ready
strike
Then
seized
the
rest
the
wrapping
paper
his
other
hand
and
pulled
And
out
fell
book
Harry
just
had
time
register
its
handsome
green
cover
emblazoned
with
the
golden
title
The
Monster
Book
Monsters
before
flipped
onto
its
edge
and
scuttled
sideways
along
the
bed
like
some
weird
crab
Harry
muttered
The
book
toppled
off
the
bed
with
loud
clunk
and
shuffled
rapidly
across
the
room
Harry
followed
stealthily
The
book
was
hiding
the
dark
space
under
his
desk
Praying
that
the
Dursleys
were
still
fast
asleep
Harry
got
down
his
hands
and
knees
and
reached
toward
Ouch
The
book
snapped
shut
his
hand
and
then
flapped
past
him
still
scuttling
its
covers
Harry
scrambled
around
threw
himself
forward
and
managed
flatten
Uncle
Vernon
gave
loud
sleepy
grunt
the
room
next
door
Hedwig
and
Errol
watched
interestedly
Harry
clamped
the
struggling
book
tightly
his
arms
hurried
his
chest
drawers
and
pulled
out
belt
which
buckled
tightly
around
The
Monster
Book
shuddered
angrily
but
could
longer
flap
and
snap
Harry
threw
down
the
bed
and
reached
for
Hagrid
card
Dear
Harry
Happy
Birthday
Think
you
might
find
this
useful
for
next
year
Won
say
more
here
Tell
you

you
Hope

Muggles
are
treating
you
right
All
the
best
Hagrid
struck
Harry
ominous
that
Hagrid
thought
biting
book
would
come
useful
but
put
Hagrid
card
next
Ron
and
Hermione
grinning
more
broadly
than
ever
Now
there
was
only
the
letter
from
Hogwarts
left
Noticing
that
was
rather
thicker
than
usual
Harry
slit
open
the
envelope
pulled
out
the
first
page
parchment
within
and
read

But

over

Deciding

into

and
reached
cross
off
another
day
the
chart
made
for
himself
counting
down
the
days
left
until
his
return

Then
took
off
his
glasses
and
lay
down
eyes
open
facing
his
three
birthday
cards
Extremely
unusual
though
was
that
moment
Harry
Potter
felt
just
like
everyone
else
glad
for
the
first
time
his
life
that
was
his
birthday
CHAPTER
TWO
AUNT
MARGE
BIG
MISTAKE
Harry
went
down
breakfast
the
next
morning
find
the
three
Dursleys
already
sitting
around
the
kitchen
table
They
were
watching
brand
new
television
welcome
home
for
the
summer
present
for
Dudley
who
had
been
complaining
loudly
about
the
long
walk
between
the
fridge
and
the
television
the
living
room
Dudley
had
spent
most
the
summer
the
kitchen
his
piggy
little
eyes
fixed
the
screen
and
his
five
chins
wobbling
ate
continually
Harry
sat
down
between
Dudley
and
Uncle
Vernon
large
beefy
man
with
very
little
neck
and
lot
mustache
Far
from
wishing
Harry
happy
birthday
none
the
Dursleys
made
any
sign
that
they
had
noticed
Harry
enter
the
room
but
Harry
was
far
too
used
this
care
helped
himself
piece
toast
and
then
looked
the
reporter
the
television
who
was
halfway
through
report
escaped
convict
The
public
warned
that
Black
armed
and
extremely
dangerous
special
hot
line
has
been
set
and
any
sighting
Black
should
reported
immediately
need
tell
good
snorted
Uncle
Vernon
staring
over
the
top
his
newspaper
the
prisoner
Look
the
state
him
the
filthy
layabout
Look
his
hair
shot
nasty
look
sideways
Harry
whose
untidy
hair
had
always
been
source
great
annoyance
Uncle
Vernon
Compared
the
man
the
television
however
whose
gaunt
face
was
surrounded
matted
elbow
length
tangle
Harry
felt
very
well
groomed
indeed
The
reporter
had
reappeared
The
Ministry
Agriculture
and
Fisheries
will
announce
today
Hang
barked
Uncle
Vernon
staring
furiously
the
reporter
You
didn
tell
where
that
maniac
escaped
from
What
use
that
Lunatic
could
coming
the
street
right
now
Aunt
Petunia
who
was
bony
and
horse
faced
whipped
around
and
peered
intently
out
the
kitchen
window
Harry
knew
Aunt
Petunia
would
simply
love
the
one
call
the
hot
line
number
She
was
the
nosiest
woman
the
world
and
spent
most
her
life
spying
the
boring
law
abiding
neighbors
When
will
they
learn
said
Uncle
Vernon
pounding
the
table
with
his
large
purple
fist
that
hanging
the
only
way
deal
with
these
people
Very
true
said
Aunt
Petunia
who
was
still
squinting
into
next
door
runner
beans
Uncle
Vernon
drained
his
teacup
glanced
his
watch
and
added

Harry
whose
thoughts
had
been
upstairs
with
the
Broomstick
Servicing
Kit
was
brought
back
earth
with
unpleasant
bump
Aunt
Marge
blurted
out
she
not
coming
here
she
Aunt
Marge
was
Uncle
Vernon
sister
Even
though
she
was
not
blood
relative
Harry
whose
mother
had
been
Aunt
Petunia
sister
had
been
forced
call
her
Aunt
all
his
life
Aunt
Marge
lived
the
country
house
with
large
garden
where
she
bred
bulldogs
She
didn
often
stay
Privet
Drive
because
she
couldn
bear
leave
her
precious
dogs
but
each
her
visits
stood
out
horribly
vividly
Harry
mind
Dudley
fifth
birthday
party
Aunt
Margo
had
whacked
Harry
around
the
shins
with
her
walking
stick
stop
him
from
beating
Dudley
musical
statues
few
years
later
she
had
turned
Christmas
with
computerized
robot
for
Dudley
and
box
dog
biscuits
for
Harry
her
last
visit
the
year
before
Harry
started
Hogwarts
Harry
had
accidentally
trodden
the
tail
her
favorite
dog
Ripper
had
chased
Harry
out
into
the
garden
and
tree
and
Aunt
Marge
had
refused
call
him
off
until
past
midnight
The
memory
this
incident
still
brought
tears
laughter
Dudley
eyes
Marge
here
for
week
Uncle
Vernon
snarled
and
while
the
subject
pointed
fat
finger
threateningly
Harry
need
get
few
things
straight
before
and
collect
her
Dudley
smirked
and
withdrew
his
gaze
from
the
television
Watching
Harry
being
bullied
Uncle
Vernon
was
Dudley
favorite
form
entertainment
Firstly
growled
Uncle
Vernon
you
keep
civil
tongue
your
head
when
you
talking
Marge
All
right
said
Harry
bitterly
she
does
when
she
talking
Secondly
said
Uncle
Vernon
acting
though
had
not
heard
Harry
reply
Marge
doesn
know
anything
about
your
abnormality
don
want
any
any
funny
stuff
while
she
here
You
behave
yourself
got
will
she
does
said
Harry
through
gritted
teeth
And
thirdly
said
Uncle
Vernon
his
mean
little
eyes
now
slits
his
great
purple
face
told
Marge
you
attend
Brutus
Secure
Center
for
Incurably
Criminal
Boys
What
Harry
yelled
And
you
sticking
that
story
boy
there
trouble
spat
Uncle
Vernon
Harry
sat
there
white
faced
and
furious
staring
Uncle
Vernon
hardly
able
believe
Aunt
Marge
coming
for
weeklong
visit
was
the
worst
birthday
present
the
Dursleys
had
ever
given
him
including
that
pair
Uncle
Vernon
old
socks
Well
Petunia
said
Uncle
Vernon
getting
heavily
his
feet
off
the
station
then
Want

for
the
ride
Dudders
said
Dudley
whose
attention
had
returned
the
television
now
that
Uncle
Vernon

Harry
Duddy

said
Aunt
Petunia
smoothing
Dudley
thick
blond
hair
Mummy

him
lovely
new
bow
tie
Uncle
Vernon
clapped
Dudley
his
porky
shoulder
See

bit
then
said
and
left
the
kitchen
Harry
who
had
been
sitting
kind
horrified
trance
had
sudden
idea
Abandoning
his
toast
got
quickly
his
feet
and
followed
Uncle
Vernon

front
door
Uncle
Vernon
was
pulling
his
car
coat
not
taking

snarled
turned

Harry
watching
him
Like

said
Harry
coldly

Uncle
Vernon
eyed
him
suspiciously
Third

Harry
snapped
Uncle
Vernon
taking
his
car

Harry

sneered
Uncle

Harry
choosing
his
words
carefully
hard
work
pretending
Aunt
Marge
that
Whatsits
Brutus

Center
for
Incurably
Criminal
Boys
bellowed
Uncle
Vernon
and
Harry
was
pleased

Harry
looking
calmly
into
Uncle

You

roared
Uncle
Vernon
advancing
Harry
with
his
fist
raised
But
Harry
stood
his
ground
Knocking
the
stuffing
out
won
make
Aunt
Marge
forget
what
could
tell
her
said
grimly
Uncle
Vernon
stopped
his
fist
still
raised
his
face
ugly
puce
But
you
sign
permission
form
Harry
went
quickly
swear
remember
where
supposed
school
and
act
like
Mug
like
normal
and
everything
Harry
could
tell
that
Uncle
Vernon
was
thinking
over
even
his
teeth
were
bared
and
vein
was
throbbing
his
temple
Right
snapped
finally
shall
monitor
your
behavior
carefully
during
Marge
visit
the
end
you
toed
the
line
and
kept
the
story
sign
your
ruddy
form
wheeled
around
pulled
open
the
front
door
and
slammed
hard
that
one
the
little
panes
glass
the
top
fell
out
Harry
didn
return
the
kitchen
went
back
upstairs
his
bedroom
was
going
act
like
real
Muggle
better
start
now
Slowly
and
sadly
gathered
all
his
presents
and
his
birthday
cards
and
hid
them
under
the
loose
floorboard
with
his
homework
Then
went
Hedwig
cage
Errol
seemed
have
recovered
and
Hedwig
were
both
asleep
heads
under
their
wings
Harry
sighed
then
poked
them
both
awake
Hedwig
said
gloomily
you
going
have
clear
off
for
week
with
Errol
Ron
look
after
you
write
him
note
explaining
And
don
look
like
that
Hedwig
large
amber
eyes
were
reproachful
not
fault
the
only
way
allowed
visit
Hogsmeade
with
Ron
and
Hermione
Ten
minutes
later
Errol
and
Hedwig
who
had
note
Ron
bound
her
leg
soared
out
the
window
and
out
sight
Harry
now
feeling
thoroughly
miserable
put
the
empty
cage
away
inside
the
wardrobe
But
Harry
didn
have
long
brood
next
time
Aunt
Petunia
was
shrieking
the
stairs
for
Harry
come
down
and
get
ready
welcome
their
guest
something
about
your
hair
Aunt
Petunia
snapped
reached
the
hall
Harry
couldn
see
the
point
trying
make
his
hair
lie
flat
Aunt
Marge
loved
criticizing
him
the
untidier
looked
the
happier
she
would
All
too
soon
there
was
crunch
gravel
outside
Uncle
Vernon

pulled
back
into
the
driveway
then
the
clunk
the
car
doors
and
footsteps
the
garden
path
Get

door
Aunt
Petunia
hissed
Harry
feeling
great
gloom
his
stomach
Harry
pulled
the
door
open
the
threshold
stood
Aunt
Marge
She
was
very
like
Uncle
Vernon
large
beefy
and
purple
faced
she
even
had
mustache
though
not
bushy
his
one
hand
she
held
enormous
suitcase
and
tucked
under
the
other
was
old
and
evil
tempered
bulldog
Where
Dudders
roared
Aunt
Marge
Where
neffy
poo
Dudley
came
waddling
down
the
hall
his
blond
hair
plastered
flat
his
fat
head
bow
tie
just
visible
under
his
many
chins
Aunt
Marge
thrust
the
suitcase
into
Harry
stomach
knocking
the
wind
out
him
seized
Dudley
tight
one
armed
hug
and
planted
large
kiss
his
cheek
Harry
knew
perfectly
well
that
Dudley
only
put
with
Aunt
Marge
hugs
because
was
well
paid
for
and
sure
enough
when
they
broke
apart
Dudley
had
crisp
twenty
pound
note
clutched
his
fat
fist
Petunia
shouted
Aunt
Marge
striding
past
Harry
though
was
hat
stand
Aunt
Marge
and
Aunt
Petunia
kissed
rather
Aunt
Marge
bumped
her
large
jaw
against
Aunt
Petunia
bony
cheekbone
Uncle
Vernon
now
came
smiling
jovially
shut
the
door
Tea
Marge
said
And
what
will
Ripper
take
Ripper
can
have
some
tea
out
saucer
said
Aunt
Marge
they
all
proceeded
into
the
kitchen
leaving
Harry
alone
the
hall
with
the
suitcase
But
Harry
wasn
complaining
any
excuse
not
with
Aunt
Marge
was
fine
him
began
heave
the
case
upstairs
into
the
spare
bedroom
taking
long
could
the
time
got
back
the
kitchen
Aunt
Marge
had
been
supplied
with
tea
and
fruitcake
and
Ripper
was
lapping
noisily
the
corner
Harry
saw
Aunt
Petunia
wince
slightly
specks
tea
and
drool
flecked
her
clean
floor
Aunt
Petunia
hated
animals
Who
looking
after
the
other
dogs
Marge
Uncle
Vernon
asked
got
Colonel
Fubster
managing
them
boomed
Aunt
Marge
retired
now
good
for
him
have
something
But
couldn
leave
poor
old
Ripper
pines
away
from
Ripper
began
growl
again
Harry
sat
down
This
directed
Aunt
Marge
attention
Harry
for
the
first
time
she
barked
Still
here
are
you
Yes
said
Harry
Don
you
say
yes
that
ungrateful
tone
Aunt
Marge
growled
damn
good
Vernon
and
Petunia
keep
you
Wouldn
have
done
myself
You
have
gone
straight
orphanage
you
been
dumped
doorstep
Harry
was
bursting
say
that
rather
live
orphanage
than
with
the
Dursleys
but
the
thought
the
Hogsmeade
form
stopped
him
forced
his
face
into
painful
smile
Don
you
smirk
boomed
Aunt
Marge
can
see
you
haven
improved
since
last
saw
you
hoped
school
would
knock
some
manners
into
you
She
took
large
gulp
tea
wiped
her
mustache
and
said
Where
that
you
send
him
again
Vernon
Brutus
said
Uncle
Vernon
promptly
first
rate
institution
for
hopeless
cases
see
said
Aunt
Marge
they
use
the
cane
Brutus
boy
she
barked
across
the
table
Uncle
Vernon
nodded
curtly
behind
Aunt
Marge
back
Yes
said
Harry
Then
feeling
might
well
the
thing
properly
added
all
the
time
Excellent
said
Aunt
Marge
won
have
this
namby
pamby
wishy
washy
nonsense
about
not
hitting
people
who
deserve
good
thrashing
what
needed
ninety
nine
cases
out
hundred
Have
you
been
beaten
often
yeah
said
Harry
loads
times
Aunt
Marge
narrowed
her
eyes
still
don
like
your
tone
boy
she
said
you
can
speak
your
beatings
that
casual
way
they
clearly
aren
hitting
you
hard
enough
Petunia
write
were
you
Make
clear
that
you
approve
the
use
extreme
force
this
boy
case
Perhaps
Uncle
Vernon
was
worried
that
Harry
might
forget
their
bargain
any
case
changed
the
subject
abruptly
Heard
the
news
this
morning
Marge
What
about
that
escaped
prisoner
Aunt
Marge
started
make
herself
home
Harry
caught
himself
thinking
almost
longingly
life
number
four
without
her
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
usually
encouraged
Harry
stay
out
their
way
which
Harry
was
only
too
happy
Aunt
Marge
the
other
hand
wanted
Harry
under
her
eye
all
times
that
she
could
boom
out
suggestions
for
his
improvement
She
delighted
comparing
Harry
with
Dudley
and
took
huge
pleasure
buying
Dudley
expensive
presents
while
glaring
Harry
though
daring
him
ask
why
hadn
got
present
too
She
also
kept
throwing
out
dark
hints
about
what
made
Harry
such
unsatisfactory
person
You
mustn
blame
yourself
for
the
way
the
boy
turned
out
Vernon
she
said
over
lunch
the
third
day
there
something
rotten
the
inside
there
nothing
anyone
can
about
Harry
tried
concentrate
his
food
but
his
hands
shook
and
his
face
was
starting
burn
with
anger
Remember
the
form
told
himself
Think
about
Hogsmeade
Don
say
anything
Don
rise
Aunt
Marge
reached
for
her
glass
wine
one
the
basic
rules
breeding
she
said
You
see
all
the
time
with
dogs
there
something
wrong
with
the
bitch
there
something
wrong
with
the
pup
that
moment
the
wineglass
Aunt
Marge
was
holding
exploded
her
hand
Shards
glass
flew
every
direction
and
Aunt
Marge
sputtered
and
blinked
her
great
ruddy
face
dripping
Marge
squealed
Aunt
Petunia
Marge
are
you
all
right
Not
worry
grunted
Aunt
Marge
mopping
her
face
with
her
napkin
Must
have
squeezed
too
hard
Did
the
same
thing
Colonel
Fubster
the
other
day
need
fuss
Petunia
have
very
firm
grip
But
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
were
both
looking
Harry
suspiciously
decided
better
skip
dessert
and
escape
from
the
table
soon
could
Outside
the
hall
leaned
against
the
wall
breathing
deeply
had
been
long
time
since
lost
control
and
made
something
explode
couldn
afford
let
happen
again
The
Hogsmeade
form
wasn
the
only
thing
stake
carried
like
that
trouble
with
the
Ministry
Magic
Harry
was
still
underage
wizard
and
was
forbidden
wizard
law
magic
outside
school
His
record
wasn
exactly
clean
either
Only
last
summer
gotten
official
warning
that
had
stated
quite
clearly
that
the
Ministry
got
wind
any
more
magic
Privet
Drive
Harry
would
face
expulsion
from
Hogwarts
heard
the
Dursleys
leaving
the
table
and
hurried
upstairs
out
the
way
Harry
got
through
the
next
three
days
forcing
himself
think
about
his
Handbook
Yourself
Broomcare
whenever
Aunt
Marge
started
him
This
worked
quite
well
though
seemed
give
him
glazed
look
because
Aunt
Marge
started
voicing
the
opinion
that
was
mentally
subnormal
last
long
last
the
final
evening
Marge
stay
arrived
Aunt
Petunia
cooked
fancy
dinner
and
Uncle
Vernon
uncorked
several
bottles
wine
They
got
all
the
way
through
the
soup
and
the
salmon
without
single
mention
Harry
faults
during
the
lemon
meringue
pie
Uncle
Vernon
bored
them
with
long
talk
about
Grunnings
his
drill
making
company
then
Aunt
Petunia
made
coffee
and
Uncle
Vernon
brought
out
bottle
brandy
Can
tempt
you
Marge
Aunt
Marge
had
already
had
quite
lot
wine
Her
huge
face
was
very
red
Just
small
one
then
she
chuckled
bit
more
than
that
and
bit
more
that
the
ticket
Dudley
was
eating
his
fourth
slice
pie
Aunt
Petunia
was
sipping
coffee
with
her
little
finger
sticking
out
Harry
really
wanted
disappear
into
his
bedroom
but
met
Uncle
Vernon
angry
little
eyes
and
knew
would
have
sit
out
Aah
said
Aunt
Marge
smacking
her
lips
and
putting
the
empty
brandy
glass
back
down
Excellent
nosh
Petunia
normally
just
fry
for
evening
with
twelve
dogs
look
after
She
burped
richly
and
patted
her
great
tweed
stomach
Pardon
But
like
see
healthy
sized
boy
she
went
winking
Dudley
You
proper
sized
man
Dudders

your
father
Yes

more
brandy
Vernon
Now

one
here
She
jerked
her
head
Harry
who
felt
his
stomach
clench
The
Handbook
thought
quickly
This
one
got
mean
runty
look
about
him
You
get
that
with
dogs
had
Colonel
Fubster
drown
one
last
year
Ratty
little
thing
was
Weak
Underbred
Harry
was
trying
remember
page
twelve
his
book
Charm
Cure
Reluctant
Reversers
all

down
blood
was
saying
the
other
day
Bad
blood
will
out
Now
saying
nothing
against
your
family
Petunia
she
patted
Aunt
Petunia
bony
hand
with
her
shovellike
one
but
your
sister
was
bad
egg
They
turn
the
best
families
Then
she
ran
off
with
wastrel
and
here
the
result
right
front
Harry
was
staring
his
plate
funny
ringing
his
ears
Grasp
your
broom
firmly
the
tail
thought
But
couldn
remember
what
came
next
Aunt
Marge
voice
seemed
boring
into
him
like
one
Uncle
Vernon
drills
This
Potter
said
Aunt
Marge
loudly
seizing
the
brandy
bottle
and
splashing
more
into
her
glass
and
over
the
tablecloth
you
never
told
what
did
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
were
looking
extremely
tense
Dudley
had
even
looked
from
his
pie
gape
his
parents
didn
work
said
Uncle
Vernon
with
half
glance
Harry
Unemployed
expected
said
Aunt
Marge
taking
huge
swig
brandy
and
wiping
her
chin
her
sleeve
account
good
for
nothing
lazy
scrounger
who
was
not
said
Harry
suddenly
The
table
went
very
quiet
Harry
was
shaking
all
over
had
never
felt
angry
his
life
MORE
BRANDY
yelled
Uncle
Vernon
who
had
gone
very
white
emptied
the
bottle
into
Aunt
Marge
glass
You
boy
snarled
Harry
bed
Vernon
hiccuped
Aunt
Marge
holding
hand
her
tiny
bloodshot
eyes
fixed
Harry
boy
Proud
your
parents
are
you
They
and
get
themselves
killed
car
crash
drunk
expect
They
didn
die
car

said
Harry
who
found
himself
his
feet
They
died
car
crash
you
nasty
little
liar
and
left
you
burden
their
decent
hardworking
relatives
screamed
Aunt
Marge
swelling
with
fury
You
are
insolent
ungrateful
little
But
Aunt
Marge
suddenly
stopped
speaking
For
moment
looked
though
words
had
failed
her
She
seemed
swelling
with
inexpressible
anger
but
the
swelling
didn
stop
Her
great
red
face
started
expand
her
tiny
eyes
bulged
and
her
mouth
stretched
too
tightly
for
speech
next
second
several
buttons
had
just
burst
from
her
tweed
jacket
and
pinged
off
the
walls
she
was
inflating
like
monstrous
balloon
her
stomach
bursting
free
her
tweed
waistband
each
her
fingers
blowing
like
salami
MARGE
yelled
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
together
Aunt
Marge
whole
body
began
rise
off
her
chair
toward
the
ceiling
She
was
entirely
round
now
like
vast
life
buoy
with
piggy
eyes
and
her
hands
and
feet
stuck
out
weirdly
she
drifted
into
the
air
making
apoplectic
popping
noises
Ripper
came
skidding
into
the
room
barking
madly
NOOOOOOO
Uncle
Vernon
seized
one
Marge
feet
and
tried
pull
her
down
again
but
was
almost
lifted
from
the
floor
himself
second
later
Ripper
leapt
forward
and
sank
his
teeth
into
Uncle
Vernon
leg
Harry
tore
from
the
dining
room
before
anyone
could
stop
him
heading
for
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
The
cupboard
door
burst
magically
open
reached
seconds
had
heaved
his
trunk
the
front
door
sprinted
upstairs
and
threw
himself
under
the
bed
wrenching
the
loose
floorboard
and
grabbed
the
pillowcase
full
his
books
and
birthday
presents
wriggled
out
seized
Hedwig
empty
cage
and
dashed
back
downstairs
his
trunk
just
Uncle
Vernon
burst
out
the
dining
room
his
trouser
leg
bloody
tatters
COME
BACK
HERE
bellowed
COME
BACK
AND
PUT
HER
RIGHT
But
reckless
rage
had
come
over
Harry
kicked
his
trunk
open
pulled
out
his
wand
and
pointed
Uncle
Vernon
She
deserved
Harry
said
breathing
very
fast
She
deserved
what
she
got
You
keep
away
from
fumbled
behind
him
for
the
latch
the
door
going
Harry
said
had
enough
And
the
next
moment
was
out
the
dark
quiet
street
heaving
his
heavy
trunk
behind
him
Hedwig
cage
under
his
arm
CHAPTER
THREE
THE
KNIGHT
BUS
Harry
was
several
streets
away
before
collapsed
onto
low
wall
Magnolia
Crescent
panting
from
the
effort
dragging
his
trunk
sat
quite
still
anger
still
surging
through
him
listening
the
frantic
thumping
his
heart
But
after
ten
minutes
alone
the
dark
street
new
emotion
overtook
him
panic
Whichever
way
looked
had
never
been
worse
fix
was
stranded
quite
alone
the
dark
Muggle
world
with
absolutely
nowhere
And
the
worst
was
had
just
done
serious
magic
which
meant
that
was
almost
certainly
expelled
from
Hogwarts
had
broken
the
Decree
for
the
Restriction
Underage
Wizardry
badly
was
surprised
Ministry
Magic
representatives
weren
swooping
down
him
where
sat
Harry
shivered
and
looked
and
down
Magnolia
Crescent
What
was
going
happen
him
Would
arrested
would
simply
outlawed
from
the
wizarding
world
thought
Ron
and
Hermione
and
his
heart
sank
even
lower
Harry
was
sure
that
criminal
not
Ron
and
Hermione
would
want
help
him
now
but
they
were
both
abroad
and
with
Hedwig
gone
had
means
contacting
them
didn
have
any
Muggle
money
either
There
was
little
wizard
gold
the
money
bag
the
bottom
his
trunk
but
the
rest
the
fortune
his
parents
had
left
him
was
stored
vault
Gringotts
Wizarding
Bank
London
never
able
drag
his
trunk
all
the
way
London
Unless
looked
down
his
wand
which
was
still
clutching
his
hand
was
already
expelled
his
heart
was
now
thumping
painfully
fast
bit
more
magic
couldn
hurt
had
the
Invisibility
Cloak
had
inherited
from
his
father
what
bewitched
the
trunk
make
feather
light
tied
his
broomstick
covered
himself
the
cloak
and
flew
London
Then
could
get
the
rest
his
money
out
his
vault
and
begin
his
life
outcast
was
horrible
prospect
but
couldn
sit
this
wall
forever
find
himself
trying
explain
Muggle
police
why
was
out
the
dead
night
with
trunkful
spellbooks
and
broomstick
Harry
opened
his
trunk
again
and
pushed
the
contents
aside
looking
for
the
Invisibility
Cloak
but
before
had
found
straightened
suddenly
looking
around
him
once
more
funny
prickling
the
back
his
neck
had
made
Harry
feel
was
being
watched
but
the
street
appeared
deserted
and
lights
shone
from
any
the
large
square
houses
bent
over
his
trunk
again
but
almost
immediately
stood
once
more
his
hand
clenched
his
wand
had
sensed
rather
than
heard
someone
something
was
standing
the
narrow
gap
between
the
garage
and
the
fence
behind
him
Harry
squinted
the
black
alleyway
only
would
move
then
know
whether
was
just
stray
cat
something
else
Lumos
Harry
muttered
and
light
appeared
the
end
his
wand
almost
dazzling
him
held
high
over
his
head
and
the
pebble
dashed
walls
number
two
suddenly
sparkled
the
garage
door
gleamed
and
between
them
Harry
saw
quite
distinctly
the
hulking
outline
something
very
big
with
wide
gleaming
eyes
Harry
stepped
backward
His
legs
hit
his
trunk
and
tripped
His
wand
flew
out
his
hand
flung
out
arm
break
his
fall
and
landed
hard
the
gutter
There
was
deafening
BANG
and
Harry
threw
his
hands
shield
his
eyes
against
sudden
blinding
light
With
yell
rolled
back
onto
the
pavement
just
time
second
later
gigantic
pair
wheels
and
headlights
screeched
halt
exactly
where
Harry
had
just
been
lying
They
belonged
Harry
saw
when
raised
his
head
triple
decker
violently
purple
bus
which
had
appeared
out
thin
air
Gold
lettering
over
the
windshield
spelled
The
Knight
Bus
For
Split
second
Harry
wondered
had
been
knocked
silly
his
fall
Then
conductor
purple
uniform
leapt
out
the
bus
and
began
speak
loudly
the
night

eve
The
conductor
stopped
abruptly
had
just
caught
sight
Harry
who
was
still
sitting
the
ground
Harry
snatched
his
wand
again
and
scrambled
his
feet
Close
saw
that
Stan
Shunpike
was
only
few
years
older
than
was
eighteen
nineteen
most
with
large
protruding
ears
and
quite
few
pimples

Stan
dropping

Fell

Harry
annoyed
One
the
knees
his
jeans
was
torn
and
the
hand
had
thrown
out
break
his
fall
was
bleeding
suddenly
remembered
why
had
fallen
over
and
turned
around
quickly
stare
the
alleyway
between
the
garage
and
fence
The
Knight
Bus
headlamps
were
flooding
with
light
and
was
empty
Choo

Stan
There
was
big
black
thing
said
Harry
pointing
uncertainly
into
the
gap
Like
dog
but
massive
looked
round
Stan
whose
mouth
was
slightly
open
With
feeling
unease
Harry
saw
Stan
eyes
move
the
scar
Harry
forehead
Woss
that

said
Stan
abruptly
Nothing

Harry
quickly
flattening
his
hair
over

for
him

want

too

for
them
Woss

his
head

suspicious
again

Harry
quickly

Harry
rummaged
once
more
his
trunk
extracted
his
money
bag
and
shoved
some
gold
into
Stan
hand
and
Stan
then
lifted
his
trunk
with
Hedwig
cage
balanced
top
the
steps
the
bus
There
were
seats
instead
half
dozen
brass
bedsteads
stood
beside
the
curtained
windows
Candles
were
burning
brackets
beside
each
bed
illuminating
the
wood
paneled
walls
tiny
wizard
nightcap
the
rear
the
bus
muttered
Not

pickling
some
slugs
and
rolled
over
his
sleep
You

Stan
whispered
shoving
Harry
trunk
under
the
bed
right
behind
the
driver
who
was

steering
wheel

Ern
Ernie

elderly

nodded
Harry
who
nervously
flattened
his
bangs
again
and
sat
down
his
bed
Take
away
Ern
said
Stan
sitting
down
the
armchair
next
Ernie
There
was
another
tremendous
BANG
and
the
next
moment
Harry
found
himself
flat
his
bed
thrown
backward
the
speed
the
Knight
Bus
Pulling
himself
Harry
stared
out
the
dark
window
and
saw
that
they
were
now
bowling
along
completely
different
street
Stan
was
watching
Harry
stunned
face
with
great
enjoyment
This
where
was
before

said

Ernie

Stan
said
Ern
Abergavenny
minute
Stan
passed
Harry
bed
and
disappeared
narrow
wooden
staircase
Harry
was
still
looking
out
the
window
feeling
increasingly
nervous
Ernie
didn
seem
have
mastered
the
use
steering
wheel
The
Knight
Bus
kept
mounting
the
pavement
but
didn
hit
anything
lines
lampposts
mailboxes
and
trash
cans
jumped
out
its
way
approached
and
back
into
position
once
had
passed
Stan
came
back
downstairs
followed
faintly
green
witch
wrapped
traveling
cloak
Ere
you
Madam
Marsh
said
Stan
happily
Ern
stamped
the
brake
and
the
beds
slid
foot
toward
the
front
the
bus
Madam
Marsh
clamped
handkerchief
her
mouth
and
tottered
down
the
steps
Stan
threw
her
bag
out
after
her
and
rammed
the
doors
shut
there
was
another
loud
BANG
and
they
were
thundering
down
narrow
country
lane
trees
leaping
out
the
way
Harry
wouldn
have
been
able
sleep
even
had
been
traveling
bus
that
didn
keep
banging
loudly
and
jumping
hundred
miles
time
His
stomach
churned
fell
back
wondering
what
was
going
happen
him
and
whether
the
Dursleys
had
managed
get
Aunt
Marge
off
the
ceiling
yet
Stan
had
unfurled
copy
the
Daily
Prophet
and
was
now
reading
with
his
tongue
between
his
teeth
large
photograph
sunken
faced
man
with
long
matted
hair
blinked
slowly
Harry
from
the
front
page
looked
strangely
familiar
That
man
Harry
said
forgetting
his
troubles
for
moment
was
the
Muggle
news
Stanley
turned
the
front
page
and
chuckled
Sirius
Black
said
nodding

Muggle

Neville

and

Harry

Neville
Harry
held

that

alive

had
never

Stan
put
the
paper
away
reluctantly
and
Harry
leaned
against
the
window
the
Knight
Bus
feeling
worse
than
ever
couldn
help
imagining
what
Stan
might
telling
his
passengers
few
nights
time
Ear
about
that
Arry
Potter
Blew
aunt
ere
the
Knight
Bus
Ern

Harry
had
broken

just
like
Sirius

Was
inflating
Aunt
Marge
bad
enough
land
him
Azkaban
Harry
didn
know
anything
about
the
wizard
prison
though
everyone
ever
heard
speak
did
the
same
fearful
tone
Hagrid
the
Hogwarts
gamekeeper
had
spent
two
months
there
only
last
year
Harry
wouldn
soon
forget
the
look
terror
Hagrid
face
when
had
been
told
where
was
going
and
Hagrid
was
one
the
bravest
people
Harry
knew
The
Knight
Bus
rolled
through
the
darkness
scattering
bushes
and
wastebaskets
telephone
booths
and
trees
and
Harry
lay
restless
and
miserable
his
feather
bed
After
while
Stan
remembered
that
Harry
had
paid
for
hot
chocolate
but
poured
all
over
Harry
pillow
when
the
bus
moved
abruptly
from
Anglesea
Aberdeen
One
one
wizards
and
witches
dressing
gowns
and
slippers
descended
from
the
upper
floors
leave
the
bus
They
all
looked
very
pleased
Finally
Harry
was
the
only
passenger
left
Right
then
Neville
said
Stan
clapping
his
hands
where
abouts
London
Diagon
Alley
said
Harry
Righto
said
Stan
Old
tight
then
BANG
They
were
thundering
along
Charing
Cross
Road
Harry
sat
and
watched
buildings
and
benches
squeezing
themselves
out
the
Knight
Bus
way
The
sky
was
getting
little
lighter
would
lie
low
for
couple
hours
Gringotts
the
moment
opened
then
set
off
where
didn
know
Ern
slammed
the
brakes
and
the
Knight
Bus
skidded
halt
front
small
and
shabby
looking
pub
the
Leaky
Cauldron
behind
which
lay
the
magical
entrance
Diagon
Alley
Thanks
Harry
said
Ern
jumped
down
the
steps
and
helped
Stan
lower
his
trunk
and
Hedwig
cage
onto
the
pavement
Well
said
Harry
Bye
then
But
Stan
wasn
paying
attention
Still
standing
the
doorway
the
bus
was
goggling
the
shadowy
entrance
the
Leaky
Cauldron
There
you
are
Harry
said
voice
Before
Harry
could
turn
felt
hand
his
shoulder
the
same
time
Stan
shouted
Blimey
Ern
come

Come

Harry
looked
the
owner

hand

shoulder
and
felt
bucketful
ice
cascade
into
his
stomach
had
walked
right
into
Cornelius
Fudge
the
Minister
Magic
himself
Stan
leapt
onto
the
pavement
beside
them
What
didja
call
Neville
Minister
said
excitedly
Fudge
portly
little
man
long
pinstriped
cloak
looked
cold
and
exhausted
Neville
repeated
frowning
This
Harry
Potter
knew
Stan
shouted
gleefully
Ern
Ern
Guess

said
Fudge
testily
well
very
glad
the
Knight
Bus
picked
Harry
but
and
need

inside
the
Leaky
Cauldron
now
Fudge
increased
the
pressure
Harry
shoulder
and
Harry
found
himself
being
steered
inside
the
pub
stooping
figure
bearing
lantern
appeared
through
the
door
behind
the
bar
was

the
wizened
toothless
landlord

said
Tom

Fudge
who

There
was
loud
scraping
and
puffing
from
behind
them
and
Stan
and
Ern
appeared
carrying
Harry
trunk
and
Hedwig
cage
and
looking
around
excitedly
come

Stan
beaming
Harry
while

peered
interestedly
over
Stan
shoulder

said
Fudge
pointedly

Harry
said
miserably
Stan
and
Ern
Tom
beckoned
Fudge
toward
the
passage
that
led
from
the
bar
Bye
Neville
called
Stan
Fudge
marched
Harry
along
the
narrow
passage
after
Tom
lantern
and
then
into
small
parlor
Tom
clicked
his
fingers
fire
burst
into
life
the
grate
and
bowed
himself
out
the
room
Sit

Harry
said
Fudge
indicating
chair
the
fire
Harry
sat
down
feeling
goose
bumps
rising
his
arms
despite
the
glow
the
fire
Fudge
took
off
his
pinstriped
cloak
and
tossed
aside
then
hitched
the
trousers
his
bottle
green
suit
and
sat
down
opposite
Harry
Cornelius
Fudge
Harry
The
Minister
Magic
Harry
already
knew
this
course
had
seen
Fudge
once
before
but
had
been
wearing
his
father
Invisibility
Cloak
the
time
Fudge
wasn
know
that
Tom
the
innkeeper
reappeared
wearing
apron
over
his
nightshirt
and
bearing
tray
tea
and
crumpets
placed
the
tray
table
between
Fudge
and
Harry
and
left
the
parlor
closing
the
door
behind
him
Well
Harry
said
Fudge
pouring
out
tea
you
had
all
right
flap
don

telling
you
Running

from
your
aunt
and
uncle
house

but

Fudge
buttered
himself
crumpet
and
pushed
the
plate
toward
Harry
Eat
Harry

look
dead
your
feet
Now
then
You
will
pleased
hear

hours

Miss
Dursley
has
been
punctured
and
her
memory
has
been
modified
She
has
recollection
the
incident
all
that
that
and
harm

Fudge
smiled
Harry
over
the
rim
his
teacup
rather
like
uncle
surveying
favorite
nephew
Harry
who
couldn
believe
his
ears
opened
his
mouth
speak
couldn
think
anything
say
and
closed
again
you
worrying
about
the
reaction
your
aunt
and
uncle
said
Fudge
Well
won
deny
that
they
are
extremely
angry
Harry
but
they
are
prepared

summer
long

Harry
unstuck
his
throat

said
and
don
ever
want

Privet
Drive
Now

once
you
calmed
down
said
Fudge
worried
tone
They
are
your
family
after
all
and
sure
you
are
fond
each
other
very
deep
down
didn
occur
Harry
put
Fudge
right
was
still
waiting
hear
what
was
going
happen
him
now
all
that
remains
said
Fudge
now
buttering
himself
second
crumpet
decide
where
you

spend
the
last
two
weeks
your
vacation
suggest
you
take
room
here
the
Leaky
Cauldron
and
Hang
blurted
Harry
What
about
punishment
Fudge
blinked
Punishment
broke
the
law
Harry
said
The
Decree
for
the
Restriction
Underage
Wizardry
dear
boy
not
going
punish
you
for
little
thing
like
that
cried
Fudge
waving
his
crumpet
impatiently
was
accident
don
send
people
Azkaban
just
for
blowing
their
aunts
But
this
didn
tally
all
with
Harry
past
dealings
with
the
Ministry
Magic
Last
year
got
official
warning
just
because
house
elf
smashed
pudding
uncle
house
told
Fudge
frowning
The
Ministry
Magic
said
expelled
from
Hogwarts
there
was
any
more
magic
there
Unless
Harry
eyes
were
deceiving
him
Fudge
was
suddenly
looking
awkward
Circumstances

Harry
have
take
into
account
the
present
climate
Surely
you
don
want
expelled
course
don
said
Harry
Well
then
what
the
fuss
about
laughed
Fudge
Now
have
crumpet
Harry
while
and
see
Tom
got
room
for
you
Fudge
strode
out
the
parlor
and
Harry
stared
after
him
There
was
something
extremely
odd
going
Why
had
Fudge
been
waiting
for
him
the
Leaky
Cauldron
not
punish
him
for
what
done
And
now
Harry
came
think
surely
wasn
usual
for
the
Minister
Magic
himself
get
involved
matters
underage
magic
Fudge
came
back
accompanied
Tom
the
innkeeper
Room

Harry
said
Fudge

said
Harry
slowly
but
why
Don
want

said
Fudge
with
hearty
laugh
best
know
where
you
are
mean
Fudge
cleared
his
throat
loudly
and
picked
his
pinstriped
cloak
Well
off
plenty
you
know
Have
you
had
any
luck
with
Black
yet
Harry
asked
Fudge
finger
slipped
the
silver
fastenings
his
cloak
What
that
you
heard
well
not
yet
but
only
matter
time
The
Azkaban
guards
have
never
yet
failed
and
they
are
angrier
than
ever
seen
them
Fudge
shuddered
slightly
say
good
bye
held
out
his
hand
and
Harry
shaking
had
sudden
idea
Minister
Can
ask
you
something
Certainly
said
Fudge
with
smile
Well
third
years
Hogwarts

allowed
visit
Hogsmeade
but
aunt
and
uncle
didn
sign
the
permission
form
you
think
you
could
Fudge
was
looking
uncomfortable
said
very
sorry
Harry
but
not
your
parent
guardian
But
you
the
Minister
Magic
said
Harry
eagerly
you
gave
permission
sorry
Harry
but

Fudge
flatly
Perhaps
You

Hogsmeade
next
year

think
best

yes
well
off
Enjoy
your
stay
Harry
And
with
last
smile
and
shake
Harry
hand
Fudge
left
the
room
Tom
now
moved
forward
beaming
Harry
you

Potter
said
already
taken
your
things
Harry
followed
Tom
handsome
wooden
staircase
door
with
brass
number
eleven
which
Tom
unlocked
and
opened
for
him
Inside
was
very
comfortable
looking
bed
some
highly
polished
oak
furniture
cheerfully
crackling
fire
and
perched
top
the
wardrobe
Hedwig
Harry
gasped
The
snowy
owl
clicked
her
beak
and
fluttered
down
onto
Harry
arm
Very
smart
owl

got
there
chuckled
Tom
Arrived
about
five
minutes
after
you
did
there
anything
you
need
Potter
don
hesitate
ask
gave
another
bow
and
left
Harry
sat
his
bed
for
long
time
absentmindedly
stroking
Hedwig
The
sky
outside
the
window
was
changing
rapidly
from
deep
velvety
blue
cold
steely
gray
and
then
slowly
pink
shot
with
gold
Harry
could
hardly
believe
that
left
Privet
Drive
only
few
hours
ago
that
wasn
expelled
and
that
was
now
facing
two
completely
Dursley
free
weeks
been
very
weird
night
Hedwig
yawned
And
without
even
removing
his
glasses
slumped
back
onto
his
pillows
and
fell
asleep
CHAPTER
FOUR
THE
LEAKY
CAULDRON

Harry
several
days

pleased
long
was
Diagon
Alley
and
this
long
cobbled
street
was
packed
with
the
most
fascinating
wizarding
shops
the
world
Harry
felt
desire
break
his
word
Fudge
and
stray
back
into
the
Muggle
world
Harry
ate
breakfast
each
morning
the
Leaky
Cauldron
where
liked
watching

and
once
what
looked
suspiciously
like
hag
who
ordered
plate
raw
liver
from
behind
thick
woollen
balaclava
After
breakfast
Harry
would
out
into
the
backyard
take
out
his
wand
tap
the
third
brick
from
the
left
above
the
trash
bit
and
stand
back

archway
into
Diagon
Alley
opened

wall
Harry
spent
the
long
sunny
days
exploring
the
shops
and
eating

the
brightly
colored
umbrellas
outside
cafes

his
fellow
diners

who
apart
from
knowing

Harry
didn

had
never

what

the
point

good

already
Harry
didn
ask
for
the

but
returned
almost
every
day
after
that
just
look
the
Firebolt
There
were
however
things
that
Harry
needed
buy

Harry

Instead

there
was

The

Monsters
Torn

were
flying
everywhere
the
books
grappled
with
each

locked
together
furious

and
snapping
aggressively
Harry
pulled
his

his
pocket
and
consulted
for
the
first
time
The
Monster
Book
Monsters

listed

Now
Harry
understood
why

relieved

been
wondering
whether
Hagrid
wanted
help
with
some
terrifying

Harry
emerged
from

Blotts
ten
minutes
later
with

new
books
under
his
arms
and
made
his
way
back
the
Leaky

and
bumping
into
several
people
tramped
the
stairs
his
room
went
inside
and
tipped
his
books
onto
his
bed
Somebody
had
been
tidy
the
windows
were
open
and
sun
was
pouring
inside
Harry
could
hear
the

rolling
the
unseen
Muggle

behind
him
and
the

Neville

being
told

very
formidable

Harry
hoped
she
never

There
wasn
much
room
inside
Every
inch
wall
was
hidden
cages

smelly
and
very
noisy

The

gulping
wetly
and
feasting
dead
blowflies
gigantic
tortoise
with
jewel
encrusted
shell
was
glittering
near
the
window
Poisonous
orange
snails
were
oozing
slowly
the
side
their
glass
tank
and
fat
white
rabbit
kept
changing
into
silk
top
hat
and
back
again
with
loud
popping
noise
Then
there
were
cats
every
color
noisy
cage
ravens
basket
funny
custard
colored
furballs
that
were
humming
loudly
and
the
counter
vast
cage
sleek
black
rats
that
were
playing
some
sort
skipping
game
using
their
long
bald
tails
The
double

Bang

the

pulling

heavy
black
spectacles
out
her
pocket
Ron
lifted
Scabbers
out
his
inside
pocket
and
placed
him
next
the
cage
his
fellow
rats
who
stopped
their
skipping
tricks
and
scuffled
the
wire
for
better
took
Like
nearly
everything
Ron
owned
Scabbers
the
rat
was
secondhand

Percy
and

Next
the
glossy
rats

woebegone
said
the
witch
picking
Scabbers
How
old
this
rat
Dunno
said
Ron
Quite
old
used
belong
brother
What
powers
does
have
said
the
witch
examining
Scabbers
closely
The
truth
was
that
Scabbers
had
never
shown
the
faintest
trace
interesting
powers
The
witchs
eyes
moved
from
Scabbers
tattered
left
ear
his
front
paw
which

the

She
indicated
the
black
rats
who
promptly
started
skipping
again
Ron
muttered
Show
offs
Well

Don

said
the
witch
reaching
under
the
counter
and
bringing
out

red
bottle
Okay
said
Ron
How

OUCH
Ron
buckled
something
huge
and
orange
came
soaring
from
the
top
the
highest
cage
landed
his
head
and
then
propelled
itself
spitting
madly
Scabbers
CROOKSHANKS
cried
the
witch
but
Scabbers
shot
from
between
her
hands
like
bar
soap
landed
splay
legged
the
floor
and
then
scampered
for
the
door
Scabbers
Ron
shouted
racing
out
the
shop
after
him
Harry
followed

them
nearly
ten
minutes

outside
Quality

Ron
stuffed
the
trembling
rat
back
into
his
pocket
and
straightened
massaging
his
head
What

either
very
big

Harry
Where

Probably

They

their
way
back

crowded
street
the
Magical
Menagerie
they
reached
Hermione
came
out
but
she
wasn
carrying
owl
Her
arms
were
clamped
tightly
around
the
enormous
ginger
cat
You

monster
said
Ron
his
mouth
hanging
open
gorgeous

Hermione
glowing
That
was
matter

thought
Harry
The
cat
ginger
fur
was
thick
and
fluffy
but
was
definitely
bit
bowlegged
and
its
face
looked
grumpy
and
oddly
squashed
though
had
run
headlong
into
brick
wall
Now
that
Scabbers
was
out
sight
however
the
cat
was
purring
contentedly
Hermione

Hermione

red
bottle
into
Ron
hand
And

Poor
Crookshanks

Ron
sarcastically
they
set
off
toward
the
Leaky
Cauldron
They
found

sitting
the
bar
reading
the
Daily
prophet
Harry
said
smiling
looked
How

said
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
joined
Weasley
with
their
shopping
Weasley
put
down
his
paper
and
Harry
saw
the
now
familiar
picture
Sirius
Black
staring
him
They
still
haven
caught
him
then
asked
said
Weasley
looking
extremely
grave
They

You
mark
words
that
moment
Mrs
Weasley
entered
the
bar
laden
with
shopping
bags
and
followed
the
twins
Fred
and
George
who
were
about
start
their
fifth
year
Hogwarts
the
newly
elected
Head
Boy
Percy
and
the
Weasleys
youngest
child
and
only
girl
Ginny
Ginny
who
had
always
been
very
taken
with
Harry
seemed
even
more
heartily
embarrassed
than
usual
when
she
saw
him
perhaps
because
had
saved
her
life
during
their
previous
year
Hogwarts
She
went
very
red
and
muttered
hello
without
looking
him
Percy
however
held
out
his
hand
solemnly
though
and
Harry
had
never
met
and
said
Harry
How
nice
see
you
Hello
Percy
said
Harry
trying
not
laugh
hope
you
well
said
Percy
pompously
shaking
hands
was
rather
like
being
introduced
the

Harry

Fred
elbowing
Percy
out
the
way
and

deeply
Simply

George

Percy

Mrs

said
Fred
though
only
just
spotted
her
and
seizing
her
hand
too
How

enough
said
Mrs
Weasley
depositing
her
shopping
empty
chair

She
pointed

said
swelling
with

And

Fred

under

Mrs
Weasley
frowning
suddenly

Mrs

Harry

Mum
spotted

Weasleys
Harry
and
Hermione
ate
their
way
through
five
delicious
courses
How

Fred

Percy

George

flags

said
Fred
Everyone

Percy
and
Mrs

into
their
pudding
Why

Percy
asked
again
dignified
voice
Well

said
Weasley
and
work
there
they
doing
favor
His
voice
was
casual
but
Harry
couldn
help
noticing
that
Weasley
ears
had
gone
red
just
like
Ron
did
when
was
under
Pressure
Good

Mrs

Ron
because

time
the
morning
Mrs
Weasley
called
down
the
table
Ron
scowled
Percy
After
dinner
everyone
felt
very
full
and
sleepy
One
one
they
made
their
way
upstairs
their
rooms
check
their
things
for
the
next
day
Ron
and
Percy
were
next
door
Harry
had
just
closed
and
locked
his
own
trunk
when
heard
angry
voices
through
the
wall
and
went
see
what
was
going
The
door
number
twelve
was
ajar
and
Percy
was
shouting

Harry
said
Ron
and
went
downstairs
Harry
was
halfway
along
the
passage
the
bar
which
was
now
very
dark
when
heard
another
pair
angry
voices
coming
from
the
parlor
second
later
recognized
them
and
Mrs
Weasleys
hesitated
not
wanting
them
know
heard
them
arguing
when
the
sound
his
own
name
made
him
stop
then
move
closer
the
parlor
door
makes
sense
not

him
Weasley
was
saying
heatedly
Harry
got
right

tried
tell
Fudge
but
insists
treating
Harry
like
child
thirteen
years
old
and
Arthur
the
truth

terrify
him

Mrs
Weasley
shrilly

hanging
over
him
For

retorted
Weasley
You

ended
the
Forbidden
Forest
twice
But
Harry

that
supposed

three
weeks
and
one
seen
hide
nor
hair
him
and
don
care
what
Fudge
keeps
telling
the
Daily
Prophet
nearer
catching
Black
than
inventing

spelling
wands
The
only
thing

what
Black

But
Harry

perfectly
safe
Hogwarts
thought
Azkaban
was
perfectly
safe
Black

break
out
Azkaban
can
break
into
Hogwarts
But
one
really
sure
that
Black
after
Harry
There
was
thud
wood
and
Harry
was
sure
Weasley
had
banged
his
fist
the
table
Molly
how
many
times
have
tell
you
They
didn
report
the
press
because
Fudge
wanted
kept
quiet
but
Fudge
went
out
Azkaban
the
night
Black
escaped
The
guards
told
Fudge
that
Blacks
been
talking
his
sleep
for
while
now
Always
the
same
words
Hogwarts
Hogwarts
Black
deranged
Molly
and

You

Black
lost
everything
the
night
Harry
stopped
You
Know
Who
and
had
twelve
years
alone
Azkaban
brood
that
There
was
silence
Harry
leaned
still
closer
the
door
desperate
hear
more
Well
Arthur
you
must
what
you
think
right
But
you
forgetting
Albus
Dumbledore
don
think
anything
could
hurt
Harry
Hogwarts
while
Dumbledore
headmaster
suppose
knows
about
all
this
course
knows
had
ask
him
minds
the
Azkaban
guards
stationing
themselves
around
the
entrances
the
school
grounds
wasn
happy
about
but
agreed
Not
happy
Why
shouldn
happy
they
there
catch
Black
Dumbledore
isn
fond
the
Azkaban
guards
said
Weasley
heavily
Nor
comes
that
but
when
you
dealing
with
wizard
like
Black
you
sometimes
have
join
forces
with
those
you
rather
avoid
they
save
Harry
then
will
never
say
another
word
against
them
said
Weasley
wearily
late
Molly
better
Harry
heard
chairs
move
quietly
could
hurried
down
the
passage
the
bar
and
out
sight
The
parlor
door
opened
and
few
seconds
later
footsteps
told
him
that
and
Mrs
Weasley
were
climbing
the
stairs
The
bottle
rat
tonic
was
lying
under
the
table
they
had
sat
earlier
Harry
waited
until
heard
and
Mrs
Weasley
bedroom
door
close
then
headed
back
upstairs
with
the
bottle
Fred
and
George
were
crouching
the
shadows
the
landing
heaving
with
laughter
they
listened
Percy
dismantling
his
and
Ron
room
search
his
badge
got
Fred
whispered
Harry
been
improving
The
badge
now
read
Bighead
Boy
Harry
forced
laugh
went
give
Ron
the
rat
tonic
then
shut
himself
his
room
and
lay
down
his
bed
Sirius
Black
was
after
him
This
explained
everything
Fudge
had
been
lenient
with
him
because
was
relieved
find
him
alive
made
Harry
promise
stay
Diagon
Alley
where
there
were
plenty
wizards
keep
eye
him
And
was
sending
two
Ministry
cars
take
them
all
the
station
tomorrow
that
the
Weasleys
could
look
after
Harry
until
was
the
train
Harry
lay
listening
the
muffled
shouting
next
door
and
wondered
why
didn
feel
more
scared
Sirius
Black
had
murdered
thirteen
people
with
one
curse
and
Mrs
Weasley
obviously
thought
Harry
would
panic
stricken
knew
the
truth
But
Harry
happened
agree
wholeheartedly
with
Mrs
Weasley
that
the
safest
place
earth
was
wherever
Albus
Dumbledore
happened
Didn
people
always
say
that
Dumbledore
was
the
only
person
Lord
Voldemort
had
ever
been
afraid
Surely
Black
Voldemort
right
hand
man
would
just
frightened
him
And
then
there
were
these
Azkaban
guards
everyone
kept
talking
about
They
seemed
scare
most
people
senseless
and
they
were
stationed
all
around
the
school
Black
chances
getting
inside
seemed
very
remote
all
all
the
thing
that
bothered
Harry
most
was
the
fact
that
his
chances
visiting
Hogsmeade
now
looked
like
zero
Nobody
would
want
Harry
leave
the
safety
the
castle
until
Black
was
caught
fact
Harry
suspected
his
every
move
would
carefully
watched
until
the
danger
had
passed
scowled
the
dark
ceiling
Did
they
think
couldn
look
after
himself
escaped
Lord
Voldemort
three
times
wasn
completely
useless
Unbidden
the
image
the
beast
the
shadows
Magnolia
Crescent
crossed
his
mind
What
when
you
know
the
worst
coming
not
going
murdered
Harry
said
out
loud
That
the
spirit
dear
said
his
mirror
sleepily
CHAPTER
FIVE
THE
DEMENTOR
Tom
woke
Harry
the
next
morning
with
his
usual
toothless
grin
and
cup
tea
Harry
got
dressed
and
was
just
persuading
disgruntled
Hedwig
get
back
into
her
cage
when
Ron
banged
his
way
into
the
room
pulling
sweatshirt
over
his
head
and
looking
irritable
The
sooner
get
the
train
the
better
said
least
can
get
away
from
Percy
Hogwarts
Now
accusing
dripping
tea
his
photo
Penelope
Clearwater
You
know
Ron
grimaced
his
girlfriend
She
hidden
her
face
under
the
frame
because
her
nose
has
gone
all
blotchy
got
something
tell
you
Harry
began
but
they
were
interrupted
Fred
and
George
who
had
looked
congratulate
Ron
infuriating
Percy
again
They
headed
down
breakfast
where
Weasley
was
reading
the
front
page
the
Daily
Prophet
with
furrowed
brow
and
Mrs
Weasley
was
telling
Hermione
and
Ginny
about
love
potion
she
made
young
girl
All
three
them
were
rather
giggly
What
were
you
saying
Ron
asked
Harry
they
sat
down
Later
Harry
muttered
Percy
stormed
Harry
had
chance
speak
Ron
Hermione
the
chaos
leaving
they
were
too
busy
heaving
all
their
trunks
down
the
Leaky
Cauldron
narrow
staircase
and
piling
them
near
the
door
with
Hedwig
and
Hermes
Percy
screech
owl
perched
top
their
cages
small
wickerwork
basket
stood
beside
the
heap
trunks
spitting
loudly
all
right
Crookshanks
Hermione
cooed
through
the
wickerwork
let
you
out
the
train
You
won
snapped
Ron
What
about
poor
Scabbers
pointed
his
chest
where
large
lump
indicated
that
Scabbers
was
curled
his
pocket
Weasley
who
had
been
outside
waiting
for
the
Ministry
cars
stuck
his
head
inside
They
here
said
Harry
come
Weasley
marched
Harry
across
the
short
stretch
pavement
toward
the
first
two
old
fashioned
dark
green
cars
each
which
was
driven
furtive
looking
wizard
wearing
suit
emerald
velvet
you
get
Harry
said
Weasley
glancing
and
down
the
crowded
street
Harry
got
into
the
back
the
car
and
was
shortly
joined
Hermione
Ron
and
Ron
disgust
Percy
The
journey
King
Cross
was
very
uneventful
compared
with
Harry
trip
the
Knight
Bus
The
Ministry
Magic
cars
seemed
almost
ordinary
though
Harry
noticed
that
they
could
slide
through
gaps
that
Uncle
Vernon
new
company
car
certainly
couldn
have
managed
They
reached
King
Cross
with
twenty
minutes
spare
the
Ministry
drivers
found
them
trolleys
unloaded
their
trunks
touched
their
hats
salute
Weasley
and
drove
away
somehow
managing
jump
the
head
unmoving
line
the
traffic
lights
Weasley
kept
close
Harry
elbow
all
the
way
into
the
station
Right
then
said
glancing
around
them
Let
this
pairs
there
are
many
through

with
Harry
Weasley
strolled
toward
the
barrier
between
platforms
nine
and
ten
pushing
Harry
trolley
and
apparently
very
interested
the
InterCity
125
that
had
just
arrived
platform
nine
With
meaningful
look
Harry
leaned
casually
against
the
barrier
Harry
imitated
him
moment
they
had
fallen
sideways
through
the
solid
metal
onto
platform
nine
and
three
quarters
and
looked
see
the
Hogwarts
Express
scarlet
steam
engine
puffing
smoke
over
platform
packed
with
witches
and
wizards
seeing
their
children
onto
the
train
Percy
and
Ginny
suddenly
appeared
behind
Harry
They
were
panting
and
had
apparently
taken
the
barrier
run
there
Penelope
said
Percy
smoothing
his
hair
and
going
Pink
again
Ginny
caught
Harry
eye
and
they
both
turned
away
hide
their
laughter
Percy
strode
over
girl
with
long
curly
hair
walking
with
his
chest
thrown
out
that
she
couldn
miss
his
shiny
badge
stood
back
let
him
They
leaned
out
the
window
and
waved
and
Mrs
Weasley
until
the
train
turned
corner
and
blocked
them
from
view
need
talk
you
private
Harry
muttered
Ron
and
Hermione
the
train
picked
speed
away
Ginny
said
Ron
that
nice
said
Ginny
huffily
and
she
stalked
off
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
set
off
down
the
corridor
looking
for
empty
compartment
but
all
were
full
except
for
the
one
the
very
end
the
train
This
had
only
one
occupant
man
sitting
fast
asleep
next
the
window
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
checked
the
threshold
The
Hogwarts
Express
was
usually
reserved
for
students
and
they
had
never
seen
adult
there
before
except
for
the
witch
who
pushed
the
food
cart
The
stranger
was
wearing
extremely
shabby
set
wizard
robes
that
had
been
darned
several
places
looked
ill
and
exhausted
Though
quite
young
his
light
brown
hair
was
flecked
with
gray
Who
you
reckon
Ron
hissed
they
sat
down
and
slid
the
door
shut
taking
the
seats
farthest
away
from
the
window
Professor
Lupin
whispered
Hermione
once
How
you
know
that
his
case
she
replied
pointing
the
luggage
rack
over
the
man
head
where
there
was
small
battered
case
held
together
with
large
quantity
neatly
knotted
string
The
name
Professor
Lupin
was
stamped
across
one
corner
peeling
letters
Wonder
what
teaches
said
Ron
frowning
Professor
Lupin
pallid
profile
That
obvious
whispered
Hermione
There
only
one
vacancy
isn
there
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
already
had
two
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teachers
both
whom
had
lasted
only
one
year
There
were
rumors
that
the
job
was
jinxed
well
hope
said
Ron
doubtfully
looks
like
good
hex
would
finish
him
off
doesn
Anyway
turned
Harry
What
were
you
going
tell
Harry
explained
all
about
and
Mrs
Weasley
argument
and
the
warning
Weasley
had
just
given
him
When
finished
Ron
looked
thunderstruck
and
Hermione
had
her
hands
over
her
mouth
She
finally
lowered
them
say
Sirius
Black
escaped
come
after
you
Harry
you
have
really
really
careful
don
looking
for
trouble
Harry
Don
looking
for
trouble
said
Harry
nettled
Trouble
usually
finds
How
thick
would
Harry
have
looking
for
nutter
who
wants
kill
him
said
Ron
shakily
They
were
taking
the
news
worse
than
Harry
had
expected
Both
Ron
and
Hermione
seemed
much
more
frightened
Black
than
was
one
knows
how
got
out
Azkaban
said
Ron
uncomfortably
one
ever
done
before
And
was
top
security
prisoner
too
But
they
catch
him
won
they
said
Hermione
earnestly
Mean
they
got
all
the
Muggles
looking
out
for
him
too
What
that
noise
said
Ron
suddenly
faint
tinny
sort
whistle
was
coming
from
somewhere
The
looked
all
around
the
compartment
coming
from
your
trunk
Harry
said
Ron
standing
and
reaching
into
the
luggage
rack
moment
later
had
pulled
the
Pocket
Sneakoscope
out
from
between
Harry
robes
was
spinning
very
fast
the
palm
Ron
hand
and
glowing
brilliantly
that
Sneakoscope
said
Hermione
interestedly
standing
for
better
look
Yeah
mind
you
very
cheap
one
Ron
said
went
haywire
just
was
tying
Errol
leg
send
Harry
Were
you
doing
anything
untrustworthy
the
time
said
Hermione
shrewdly
Well
wasn
supposed
using
Errol
You
know
not
really
long
journeys
but
how
else
was
supposed
get
Harry
present
him
Stick
back
the
trunk
Harry
advised
the
Sneakoscope
whistled
piercingly
wake
him
nodded
toward
Professor
Lupin
Ron
stuffed
the
Sneakoscope
into
particularly
horrible
pair
Uncle
Vernon
old
socks
which
deadened
the
sound
then
closed
the
lid
the
trunk
could
get
checked
Hogsmeade
said
Ron
sitting
back
down
They
sell
that
sort
thing
Dervish
and
Banges
magical
instruments
and
stuff
Fred
and
George
told
you

asked
Hermione
keenly
read
the
only
entirely
non
Muggle
settlement

Ron
offhand
sort
way
But

Why

Hermione

Ron

and
great
fat
Chocoballs
full
strawberry
mousse
and
clotted
cream
and
really
excellent
sugar
quills
which
you
can
suck
class
and
just
look
like
you
thinking
what
write
next
But
Hogsmeade
very
interesting
place
isn
Hermione
pressed
eagerly
Sites
Historical
Sorcery
says
the
inn
was
the
headquarters
for
the
1612
goblin
rebellion
and
the
Shrieking
Shades
supposed
the
most
severely
haunted
building
Britain
and
massive
sherbert
balls
that
make
you
levitate
few
inches
off
the
ground
while
you
sucking
them
said
Ron
who
was
plainly
not
listening
word
Hermione
was
saying
Hermione
looked
around
Harry
Won
nice
get
out
school
for
bit
and
explore
Hogsmeade
Spect

said
Harry
heavily
You
have
tell
when
You
found

What

said
Ron
can
The
Dursleys

sign
permission
form
and
Fudge

Ron
looked
horrified
You
not
allowed

But

McGonagall
someone

permission
musclely
Crabbe
was
taller
with
pudding
bowl

and
very
thick
neck
Goyle
had
short
bristly
hair
and
long
gorilla

arms
Well

Malfoy

lazy
drawl
pulling

the
compartment
door
Potty

Ron

quickly
knocked
Crookshanks
basket
the
floor
Professor
Lupin
gave
snort
Who

Malfoy
taking
automatic
step
backward
spotted
Lupin
New

Harry

Ron
back
What
were

Malfoy
Malfoy
pale
eyes
narrowed

fool
enough
pick
fight
right
under

nose
mon
muttered
resentfully
Crabbe
and
Goyle
and
they
disappeared
Harry
and
Ron
sat
down
again
Ron
massaging
his
knuckles
not
going
take
any
crap
from
Malfoy
this
year
said
angrily
mean
makes
one
more
crack
about
family
going
get
hold
his
head
and
Ron
made
violent
gesture
midair
Ron
hissed
Hermione
pointing
Professor
Lupin
careful
But
Professor
Lupin
was
still
fast
asleep
The
rain
thickened
the
train
sped
yet
farther
north
the
windows
were
now
solid
shimmering
gray
which
graduily
darkened
until
lanterns
flickered
into
life
all
along
the
corridors
and
over
the
luggage
racks
The
train
rattled
the
rain
hammered
the
ind
roared
but
still
Professor
Lupin
slept
must
nearly
there
said
Ron
leaning
forward
look
past
Professor
Lupin
the
now
completely
black
window
The
words
had
hardly
left
him
when
the
train
started
slow
down
Great
said
Ron
getting
and
walking
carefully
past
Professor
Lupin
try
and
see
outside
starving
want
get
the
feast

said
Hermione
checking
her
watch
why
stopping
The
train
was
getting
slower
and
slower
the
noise
the
pistons
fell
away
the
wind
and
rain
sounded
louder
than
ever
against
the
windows
Harry
who
was
nearest
the
door
got
look
into
the
corridor
All
along
the
carriage
heads
were
sticking
curiously
out
their
compartments
The
train
came
stop
with
jolt
and
distant
thuds
and
bangs
told
them
that
luggage
had
fallen
out
the
racks
Then
without
warning
all
the
lamps
went
out
and
they
were
plunged
into
total
darkness
What
going
said
Ron
voice
from
behind
Harry
Ouch
gasped
Hermione
Ron
that
was
foot
Harry
felt
his
way
back
his
seat
you
think
broken
down
Dunno
There
was
squeaking
sound
and
Harry
saw
the
dim
black
outline
Ron
wiping
patch
clean
the
window
and
peering
out
There
something
moving
out
there
Ron
said
think
people
are
coming
aboard
The
compartment
door
suddenly
opened
and
someone
fell
painfully
over
Harry
legs
Sorry
you
know
what
going
Ouch
sorry
Hullo
Neville
said
Harry
feeling
around
the
dark
and
pulling
Neville
his
cloak
Harry
that
you
What
happening
idea
sit
down
There
was
loud
hissing
and
yelp
pain
Neville
had
tried
sit
Crookshanks
going
and
ask
the
driver
what
going
came
Hermione
voice
Harry
felt
her
pass
him
heard
the
door
slide
open
again
and
then
thud
and
two
loud
squeals
pain
Who
that
Who
that
Ginny
Hermione
What
are
you
doing
was
looking
for
Ron
Come
and
sit
down
Not
here
said
Harry
hurriedly
here
Ouch
said
Neville
Quiet
said
hoarse
voice
suddenly
Professor
Lupin
appeared
have
woken
last
Harry
could
hear
movements
his
corner
None
them
spoke
There
was
soft
crackling
noise
and
shivering
light
filled
the
compartment
Professor
Lupin
appeared
holding
handful
flames
They
illuminated
his
tired
gray
face
but
his
eyes
looked
alert
and
wary
Stay
where
you
are
said
the
same
hoarse
voice
and
got
slowly
his
feet
with
his
handful
fire
held
out
front
him
But
the
door
slid
slowly
open
before
Lupin
could
reach
Standing
the
doorway
illuminated
the
shivering
flames
Lupin
hand
was
cloaked
figure
that
towered
the
ceiling
Its
face
was
completely
hidden
beneath
its
hood
Harry
eyes
darted
downward
and
what
saw
made
his
stomach
contract
There
was
hand
protruding
from
the
cloak
and
was
glistening
grayish
slimy
looking
and
scabbed
like
something
dead
that
had
decayed
water
But
was
visible
only
for
split
second
though
the
creature
beneath
the
cloak
sensed
Harry
gaze
the
hand
was
suddenly
withdrawn
into
the
folds
its
black
cloak
And
then
the
thing
beneath
the
hood
whatever
was
drew
long
slow
rattling
breath
though
were
trying
suck
something
more
than
air
from
its
surroundings
intense
cold
swept
over
them
all
Harry
felt
his
own
breath
catch
his
chest
The
cold
went
deeper
than
his
skin
was
inside
his
chest
was
inside
his
very
heart
Harry
eyes
rolled
into
his
head
couldn
see
was
drowning
cold
There
was
rushing
his
ears
though
water
was
being
dragged
downward
the
roaring
growing
louder
And
then
from
far
away
heard
screaming
terrible
terrified
pleading
screams
wanted
help
whoever
was
tried
move
his
arms
but
couldn
thick
white
fog
was
swirling
around
him
inside
him
Harry
Harry
Are
you
all
right
Someone
was
slapping
his
face
what
Harry
opened
his
eyes
there
were
lanterns
above
him
and
the
floor
was
shaking
the
Hogwarts
Express
was
moving
again
and
the
lights
had
come
back
seemed
have
slid
out
his
seat
onto
the
floor
Ron
and
Hermione
were
kneeling
next
him
and
above
them
could
see
Neville
and
Professor
Lupin
watching
Harry
felt
very
sick
when
put
his
hand
push
his
glasses
back
felt
cold
sweat
his
face
Ron
and
Hermione
heaved
him
back
onto
his
seat
Are
you
okay
Ron
asked
nervously
Yeah
said
Harry
looking
quickly
toward
the
door
The
hooded
creature
had
vanished
What
happened
Where
that
that
thing
Who
screamed
one
screamed
said
Ron
more
nervously
still
Harry
looked
around
the
bright
compartment
Ginny
and
Neville
looked
back
him
both
very
pale
But
heard
screaming
loud
snap
made
them
all
jump
Professor
Lupin
was
breaking
enormous
slab
chocolate
into
pieces
Here
said
Harry
handing
him
particularly
large
piece
Eat

Harry
took
the
chocolate
but
didn
eat
What
was
that
thing
asked
Lupin
dementor
said
Lupin
who
was
now
giving
chocolate
everyone
else
One
the
dementors
Azkaban
Everyone
stared
him
Professor
Lupin
crumpled
the
empty
chocolate
wrapper
and
put
his
pocket
Eat
repeated
help
need
speak
the
driver
excuse
strolled
past
Harry
and
disappeared
into
the
corridor
Are
you
sure
you
okay
Harry
said
Hermione
watching
Harry
anxiously
Don
get
What
happened
said
Harry
wiping
more
sweat
off
his
face
Well
that
thing
the
dementor
stood
there
and
looked
around
mean
think
did
couldn
see
its
face
and
you
you
thought
you
were
having
fit
something
said
Ron
who
still
looked
scared
You
went
sort
rigid
and
fell
out
your
seat
and
started
twitching
And
Professor
Lupin
stepped
over
you
and
walked
toward
the
dementor
and
pulled
out
his
wand
said
Hermione
and
said
None
hiding
Sirius
Black
under
our
cloaks
But
the
dementor
didn
move
Lupin
muttered
something
and
silvery
thing
shot
out
his
wand
and
turned
around
and
sort
glided
away
was
horrible
said
Neville
higher
voice
than
usual
Did
YOU
feel
how
cold
got
when
came
felt
weird
said
Ron
shifting
his
shoulders
uncomfortably
Like
never
cheerful
again
Ginny
who
was
huddled
her
corner
looking
nearly
bad
Harry
felt
gave
small
sob
Hermione
went
over
and
put
comforting
arm
around
her
But
didn
any
you
fall
off
your
seats
said
Harry
awkwardly
said
Ron
looking
anxiously
Harry
again
Ginny
was
shaking
like
mad
though
Harry
didn
understand
felt
weak
and
shivery
though
were
recovering
from
bad
bout
flu
also
felt
the
beginnings
shame
Why
had
gone
pieces
like
that
when
one
else
had
Professor
Lupin
had
come
back
paused
entered
looked
around
and
said
with
small
smile
haven
poisoned
that
chocolate
you
know
Harry
took
bite
and
his
great
surprise
felt
warmth
spread
suddenly
the
tips
his
fingers
and
toes
Hogwarts
ten
minutes
said
Professor
Lupin
Are
you
all
right
Harry
Harry
didn
ask
how
Professor
Lupin
knew
his
name
Fine
muttered
embarrassed
They
didn
talk
much
during
the
remainder
the
journey
long
last
the
train
stopped
Hogsmeade
station
and
there
was
great
scramble
get
outside
owls
hooted
cats
meowed
and
Neville
pet
toad
croaked
loudly
from
under
his
hat
was
freezing
the
tiny
platform
rain
was
driving
down
icy
sheets
Firs
years
this
way
called
familiar
voice
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
turned
and
saw
the
gigantic
outline
Hagrid
the
other
end
the
platform
beckoning
the
terrified
looking
new
students
forward
for
their
traditional
journey
across
the
lake
All
right
you
three
Hagrid
yelled
over
the
heads
the
crowd
They
waved
him
but
had
chance
speak
him
because
the
mass
people
around
them
was
shunting
them
away
along
the
platform
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
followed
the
rest
the
school
along
the
platform
and
out
onto
rough
mud
track
where
least
hundred
stagecoaches
awaited
the
remaining
students
each
pulled
Harry
could
only
assume
invisible
horse
because
when
they
climbed
inside
and
shut
the
door
the
coach
set
off
all
itself
bumping
and
swaying
procession
The
coach
smelled
faintly
mold
and
straw
Harry
felt
better
since
the
chocolate
but
still
weak
Ron
and
Hermione
kept
looking
him
sideways
though
frightened
might
collapse
again
the
carriage
trundled
toward
pair
magnificent
wrought
iron
gates
flanked
with
stone
columns
topped
with
winged
boars
Harry
saw
two
more
towering
hooded
dementors
standing
guard
either
side
wave
cold
sickness
threatened
engulf
him
again
leaned
back
into
the
lumpy
seat
and
closed
his
eyes
until
they
had
passed
the
gates
The
carriage
picked
speed
the
long
sloping
drive
the
castle
Hermione
was
leaning
out
the
tiny
window
watching
the
many
turrets
and
towers
draw
nearer
last
the
carriage
swayed
halt
and
Hermione
and
Ron
got
out
Harry
stepped
down
drawling
delighted
voice
sounded
his
ear
You
fainted
Potter
Longbottorn
telling
the
truth
You
actualy
fainted
Malfoy
elbowed
past
Hermione
block
Harry
way
the
stone
steps
the
castle
his
face
gleeful
and
his
pale
eyes
glinting
maliciously
Shove
off
Malfoy
said
Ron
whose
jaw
was
clenched
Did
you
faint
well
Weasley
said
Malfoy
loudly
Did
the
scary
old
dementor
frighten
you
too
Weasley
there
problem
said
mild
voice
Professor
Lupin
had
just
gotten
out
the
next
carriage
Malfoy
gave
Professor
Lupin
insolent
stare
which
took
the
patches
his
robes
and
the
delapidated
suitcase
With
tiny
hint
sarcasm
his
voice
said
Professor
then
smirked
Crabbe
and
Goyle
and
led
them
the
steps
into
the
castle
Hermione
prodded
Ron
the
back
make
him
hurry
and
the
three
them
joined
the
crowd
swarming
the
steps
through
the
giant
oak
front
doors
into
the
cavernous
entrance
hall
which
was
lit
with
flaming
torches
and
housed
magnificent
marble
staircase
that
led
the
upper
floors
The
door
into
the
Great
Hall
stood
open
the
right
Harry
followed
the
crowd
toward
but
had
barely
glimpsed
the
enchanted
ceiling
which
was
black
and
cloudy
tonight
when
voice
called
Potter
Granger
want
see
you
both
Harry
and
Hermione
turned
around
surprised
Professor
McGonagall
Transfiguration
teacher
and
head
Gryffindor
House
was
calling
over
the
heads
the
crowd
She
was
sternlooking
witch
who
wore
her
hair
tight
bun
her
sharp
eyes
were
framed
with
square
spectacles
Harry
fought
his
way
over
her
with
feeling
foreboding
Professor
McGonagall
had
way
making
him
feel
must
have
done
something
wrong
There
need
look
worried
just
want
word
office
she
told
them
Move

there
Weasley
Ron
stared
Professor
McGonagall
ushered
Harry
and
Hermione
away
from
the
chattering
crowd
they
accompanied
her
across
the
entrance
hall
the
marble
staircase
and
along
corridor
Once
they
were
her
office
small
room
with
large
welcoming
fire
Professor
McGonagall
motioned
Harry
and
Hermione
sit
down
She
settled
herself
behind
her
desk
and
said
abruptly
Professor
Lupin
sent
owl
ahead
say
that
you
were
taken
ill
the
train
Potter
Before
Harry
could
reply
there
was
soft
knock
the
door
and
Madam
Pomfrey
the
nurse
came
bustling
Harry
felt
himself
going
red
the
face
was
bad
enough
that
passed
out
whatever
had
done
without
everyone
making
all
this
fuss
fine
said
don
need

said
Madam
Pomfrey
ignoring
this
and
bending
down
stare
closely
him

been
doing
something
dangerous
again
was
dementor
Poppy
said
Professor
McGonagall
They
exchanged
dark
look
and
Madam
Pomfrey
clucked
disapprovingly
Setting
dementors
around
school
she
muttered
pushing
back
Harry
hair
and
feeling
his
forehead
won
the
last
one
who
collapses
Yes
all
clammy
Terrible
things
they
are
and
the
effect
they
have
people
who
are
already
delicate

said
Harry
crossly
course

Madam
Pomfrey
absentmindedly
now
taking
his
pulse
What

said
Professor
McGonagall
crisply
Bed
rest
Should
perhaps
spend
tonight
the
hospital
wing
fine
said
Harry
jumping
The
thought
what
Draco
Malfoy
would
say
had
the
hospital
wing
was
torture
Well
should
have
some
chocolate
the
very
least
said
Madam
Pomfrey
who
was
now
trying
peer
into
Harry
eyes
already
had
some
said
Harry
Professor
Lupin
gave
some
gave
all
Did

said
Madam
Pomfrey
approvingly
finally
got
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
who
knows
his
remedies
Are

all
right
Potter
Professor
McGonagall
said
sharply
Yes
said
Harry
Very
well
Kindly
wait
outside
while

quick
word
with
Miss
Granger
about
her
course
schedule
then

the
feast
together
Harry
went
back
into
the
corridor
with
Madam
Pomfrey
who
left
for
the
hospital
wing
muttering
herself
had
wait
only
few
minutes
then
Hermione
emerged
looking
very
happy
about
something
followed
Professor
McGonagall
and
the
three
them
made
their
way
back
down
the
marble
staircase
the
Great
Hall
was
sea
pointed
black
hats
each
the
long
House
tables
was
lined
with
students
their
faces
glimmering
the
light
thousands
candles
which
were
floating
over
the
tables
midair
Professor
Flitwick
who
was
tiny
little
wizard
with
shock
white
hair
was
carrying
ancient
hat
and
three
legged
stool
out
the
hall
said
Hermione
softly
missed
the
Sorting
New
students
Hogwarts
were
sorted
into
Houses
trying
the
sorting
Hat
which
shouted
out
the
House
they
were
best
suited
Gryffindor
Ravenclaw
Hufflepuff
Slytherin
Professor
McGonagall
strode
off
toward
her
empty
seat
the
staff
table
and
Harry
and
Hermione
set
off
the
other
direction
quietly
possible
toward
the
Gryffindor
table
People
looked
around
them
they
passed
along
the
back
the
hall
and
few
them
pointed
Harry
Had
the
story
his
collapsing
front
the
dementor
traveled
that
fast
and
Hermione
sat
down
either
side
Ron
who
had
saved
them
seats
What
was
all
that
about
muttered
Harry
Harry
started
explain
whisper
but
that
moment
the
headmaster
stood
speak
and
broke
off
Professor
Dumbledore
though
very
old
always
gave
impression
great
energy
had
several
feet
long
silver
hair
and
beard
half
moon
spectacles
and
extremely
crooked
nose
was
often
described
the
greatest
wizard
the
age
but
that
wasn
why
Harry
respected
him
You
couldn
help
trusting
Albus
Dumbledore
and
Harry
watched
him
beaming
around
the
students
felt
really
calm
for
the
first
time
since
the
dementor
had
entered
the
train
compartment
Welcome
said
Dumbledore
the
candlelight
shimmering
his
beard
Welcome
another
year
Hogwarts
have
few
things
say
you
all
and
one
them
very
serious
think
best
get
out
the
way
before
you

befuddled

Dumbledore
cleared
his
throat
and
continued
you

their
search

Hogwarts
Express
our
school
presently
playing
host
some
the
dementors
Azkaban

Ministry
Magic
business
paused
and
Harry
remembered
what
Weasley
had
said
about
Dumbledore
not
being
happy
with
the
dementors
guarding
the
school
They
are
stationed
every
entrance
the
grounds
Dumbledore
continued
and
while
they
are
with
must
make
plain
that
nobody
leave
school
without
permission
Dementors
are
not
fooled
tricks
disguises
even
Invisibility
Cloaks
added
blandly
and
Harry
and
Ron
glanced
each
other
not
the
nature

pleading
excuses
therefore
warn
each
and
every
one
you
give
them

the
prefects
and
our
new
Head
Boy
and
Girl
make
sure
that
student
runs
afoul
the
dementors
said
Percy
who
was
sitting
few
seats
down
from
Harry
puffed
out
his
chest
again
and
stared
around
impressively
Dumbledore
paused
again
looked
very
seriously
around
the
hall
and
nobody
moved
made
sound
happier
note
continued
pleased
welcome
two
new
teachers
our
ranks
this
year
First
Professor
Lupin
who
has
kindly
consented
fill
the
post
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
There
was
some
scattered
rather
unenthusiastic
applause
Only
those
who
had
been
the
compartment
the
train
with
Professor
Lupin
clapped
hard
Harry
among
them
Professor
Lupin
looked
particularly
shabby
next
all
the
other
teachers
their
best
robes
Look
Snape
Ron
hissed
Harry
ear
Professor
Snape
the
Potions
master
was
staring
along
the
staff
table
Professor
Lupin
was
common
knowledge
that
Snape
anted
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
job
but
even
Harry
who
hated
Snape
was
startled
the
expression
twisting
his
thin
sallow
face
was
beyond
anger
was
loathing
Harry
knew
that
expression
only
too
well
was
the
look
Snape
wore
every
time
set
eyes
Harry
our
second
new
appointment
Dumbledore
continued
the
lukewarm
applause
for
Professor
Lupin
died
away
Well
sorry
tell
you
that
Professor
Kettleburn
our
Care
Magical
Creatures
teacher
retired
the
end
last
year
order
enjoy
more
time
with
his
remaining
limbs
However
delighted
say
that
his
place
will
filled
none
other
than
Rubeus
Hagrid
who
has
agreed
take
this
teaching
job
addition
his
gamekeeping
duties
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stared
one
another
stunned
Then
they
joined
with
the
applause
which
was
tumultuous
the
Gryffindor
table
particular
Harry
leaned
forward
see
Hagrid
who
was
ruby
red
the
face
and
staring
down
his
enormous
hands
his
wide
grin
hidden
the
tangle
his
black
beard
should
known
Ron
roared
pounding
the
table
Who
else
would
have
assigned
biting
book
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
the
last
stop
clapping
and
Professor
Dumbledore
started
speaking
again
they
saw
that
Hagrid
was
wiping
his
eyes
the
tablecloth
Well
think
that
everything
importance
said
Dumbledore
Let
the
feast
begin
The
golden
plates
and
goblets
before
them
filled
suddenly
with
food
and
drink
Harry
suddenly
ravenous
helped
himself
everything
could
reach
and
began
eat
was
delicious
feast
the
hall
echoed
with
talk
laughter
and
the
clatter
knives
and
forks
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
however
were
eager
for
finish
that
they
could
talk
Hagrid
They
knew
how
much
being
made
teacher
would
mean
him
Hagrid
wasn
fully
qualified
wizard

been
expelled
from
Hogwarts
his
third
year

been
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione

had
cleared
Hagrid

last
year
long
last
when
the
last
morsels
pumpkin
tart
had
melted
from
the
golden
platters
Dumbledore
gave
the
word
that

and
they
got
their
chance
Congratulations
Hagrid
Hermione
squealed
they
reached
the
teachers
table
All

said
Hagrid
wiping
his
shining
face
his
napkin
looked
them
Can

Dumbledore

straight
down

after
Professor
Kettleburn
said
had
enough
what
always
wanted
Overcome
with
emotion
buried
his
face
his
napkin
and
Professor
McGonagall
shooed
them
away
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
joined
the
Gryffindors

Through

across

the

Harry
climbed
the

with
thought
his

how

They
reached
their

Harry
looking

TALONS
AND
TEA
LEAVES
When
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
entered
the
Great
Hall
for
breakfast
the
next
day
the
first
thing
they
saw
was
Draco
Malfoy
who
seemed
entertaining
large
group
Slytherins
with
very
funny
story
they
passed
Malfoy
did
ridiculous
impression
swooning
fit
and
there
was
roar
laughter
Ignore
him
said
Hermione
who
was
right
behind
Harry
Just
ignore
him
not
worth
Hey
Potter
shrieked
Pansy
Parkinson
Slytherin
girl
with
face
like
pug
Potter
The
dementors
are
coming
Potter
Woooooooooo
Harry
dropped
into
seat
the
Gryffindor
table
next
George
Weasley
New
third
year
course
schedules
said
George
passing
then
over
What
with
you
Harry
Malfoy
said
Ron
sitting
down
George
other
side
and
glaring
over
the
Slytherin
table
George
looked
time
see
Malfoy
pretending
faint
with
terror
again
That
little
git
said
calmly
wasn
cocky
last
night
when
the
dementors
were
down
our
end
the
train
Came
runing
into
our
compartment
didn
Fred
Nearly
wet
himself
said
Fred
with
contemptuous
glance
Malfoy
wasn
too
happy
myself
said
George
They
horrible
things
those
dementors
Sort
freeze
your
insides
don
they
said
Fred
You
didn
pass
out
though
did
you
said
Harry
low
voice
Forget
Harry
said
George
bracingly
Dad
had
out
Azkaban
one
time
remember
Fred
And
said
was
the
worst
place
ever
been
came
back
all
weak
and
shaking
They
suck
the
happiness
out
place
dementors
Most
the
prisoners
mad
there
Anyway
see
how
happy
Malfoy
looks
after
our
first
Quidditch
match
said
Fred
Gryffindor
versus
Slytherin
first
game
the
season
remember
The
only
time
Harry
and
Malfoy
had
faced
each
other
Quidditch
match
Malfoy
had
definitely
come
off
worse
Feeling
slightly
more
cheerful
Harry
helped
himself
sausages
and
fried
tomatoes
Hermione
was
examining
her
new
schedule
Ooh
good
starting
some
new
subjects
today
she
said
happily
villains
are
these
that
trespass
upon
private
lands
Come
scorn
fall
perchance
Draw
you
knaves
you
dogs
They
watched
astonishment
the
little
knight
tugged
his
sword
out
its
scabbard
and
began
brandishing
violently
hopping
and
down
rage
But
the
sword
was
too
long
for
him
particularly
wild
swing
made
him
overbalance
and
landed
facedown
the
grass
Are
you
all
right
said
Harry
moving
closer
the
picture
Get
back
you
scurvy
braggart
Back
you
rogue
The
knight
seized
his
sword
again
and
used
push
himself
back
but
the
blade
sank
deeply
into
the
grass
and
though
pulled
with
all
his
might
couldn
get
out
again
Finally
had
flop
back
down
onto
the
grass
and
push
his
visor
mop
his
sweating
face
Listen
said
Harry
taking
advantage
the
knight
exhaustion
looking
for
the
North
Tower
You
don
know
the
way
you
quest
The
knight
rage
seemed
vanish
instantly
clanked
his
feet
and
shouted
Come
follow
dear
friends
and
shall
find
our
goal
else
shall
perish
bravely
the
charge
gave
the
sword
another
fruitless
tug
tried
and
failed
mount
the
fat
pony
gave
and
cried
foot
then
good
sirs
and
gentle
lady
And
ran
clanking
loudly
into
the
left
side
the
frame
and
out
sight
They
hurried
after
him
along
the
corridor
following
the
sound
his
armor
Every
now
and
then
they
spotted
him
running
through
picture
ahead
stout
heart
the
worst
yet
come
yelled
the
knight
and
they
saw
him
reappear
front
alarmed
group
women
crinolines
whose
picture
hung
the
wall
narrow
spiral
staircase
Puffing
loudly
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
climbed
the
tightly
spiraling
steps
getting
dizzier
and
dizzier
until
last
they
heard
the
murmur
voices
above
them
and
knew
they
had
reached
the
classroom
Farewell
cried
the
knight
popping
his
head
into
painting
some
sinister
looking
monks
Farewell
comrades
arms
ever
you
have
need
noble
heart
and
steely
sinew
call
upon
Sir
Cadogan
Yeah
call
you
muttered
Ron
the
knight
disappeared
ever
need
someone
mental
They
climbed
the
last
few
steps
and
emerged
onto
tiny
landing
where
most
the
class
was
already
assembled
There
were
doors
off
this
landing
but
Ron
nudged
Harry
and
pointed
the
ceiling
where
there
was
circular
trapdoor
with
brass
plaque
Sibyll
Trelawney
Divination
teacher
Harry
read
How
supposed
get
there
though
answer
his
question
the
trapdoor
suddenly
opened
and
silvery
ladder
descended
right
Harry
feet
Everyone
got
quiet
After
you
said
Ron
grinning
Harry
climbed
the
ladder
first
emerged
into
the
strangest
looking
classroom
had
ever
seen
fact
didn
look
like
classroom
all
more
like
cross
between
someone
attic
and
old
fashioned
tea
shop
leasttwenty
small
circular
tables
were
crammed
inside
all
surrounded
chintz
armchairs
and
fat
little
poufs
Everything
was
lit
with
dim
crimson
light
the
curtains
the
windows
were
all
closed
and
the
many
lamps
were
draped
with
dark
red
scarves
was
stiflingly
warm
and
the
fire
that
was
burning
under
the
crowded
mantelpiece
was
giving
off
heavy
sickly
sort
perfume
heated
large
copper
kettle
The
shelves
running
around
the
circular
walls
were
crammed
with
dusty
looking
feathers
stubs
candles
many
packs
tattered
playing
cards
countless
silvery
crystal
balls
and
huge
array
teacups
Ron
appeared
Harry
shoulder
the
class
assembled
around
them
all
talking
whispers
Where
she
Ron
said
voice
came
suddenly
out
the
shadows
soft
misty
sort
voice
Welcome
said
How
nice
see
you
the
physical
world
last
Harry
immediate
impression
was
large
glittering
insect
Professor
Trelawney
moved
into
the
firelight
and
they
saw
that
she
was
very
thin
her
large
glasses
magnified
her
eyes
several
times
their
natural
size
and
she
was
draped
gauzy
spangled
shawl
Innumerable
chains
and
beads
hung
around
her
spindly
neck
and
her
arms
and
hands
were
encrusted
with
bangles
and
rings
Sit
children
sit
she
said
and
they
all
climbed
awkwardly
into
armchairs
sank
onto
poufs
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
themselves
around
the
same
round
table
Welcome
Divination
said
Professor
Trelawney
who
had
seated
herself
winged
armchair
front
the
fire
name
professor
Trelawney
You
may
not
have
seen
before
find
that
descending
too
often
into
the
hustle
and
bustle
the
main
school
clouds
Inner
Eye
Nobody
said
anything
this
extraordinary
pronouncement
Professor
Trelawney
delicately
rearranged
her
shawl
and
continued
you
have
chosen
study
Divination
the
most
difficult
all
magical
arts
must
warn
you
the
outset
that
you
not
have
the
Sight
there
very
little
will
able
teach
you
Books
can
take
you
only
far
this
field
these
words
both
Harry
and
Ron
glanced
grinning
Hermione
who
looked
startled
the
news
that
books
wouldn
much
help
this
subject
Many
witches
and
wizards
talented
though
they
are
the
area
loud
bangs
and
smells
and
sudden
disappearings
are
yet
unable
penetrate
the
veiled
mysteries
the
future
Professor
Trelawney
went
her
enormous
gleaming
eyes
moving
from
face
nervous
face
Gift
granted
few
You
boy
she
said
suddenly
Neville
who
almost
toppled
off
his
pouf
your
grandmother
well
think
said
Neville
tremulously
wouldn
sure
were
you
dear
said
Professor
Trelawney
the
firelight
glinting
her
long
emerald
earrings
Neville
gulped
Professor
Trelawney
continued
placidly
will
covering
the
basic
methods
Divination
this
year
The
first
term
will
devoted
reading
the
tea
leaves
Next
term

she
shot
suddenly
Parvati
Patil
beware
red
haired
man
Parvati
gave
startled
look
Ron
who
was
right
behind
her
and
edged
her
chair
away
from
him
the
second
term
Professor
Trelawney
went
shall
progress
the
crystal
ball

finished
with

Unfortunately

February
nasty

And
around
Easter
one
our
number
will
leave
forever
very
tense
silence
followed
this
pronouncement
but
Professor
Trelawney
seemed
unaware
wonder
dear
she
said
Lavender
Brown
who
was
nearest
and
shrank
back
her
chair
you
could
pass
the
largest
silver
teapot
Lavender
looking
relieved
stood
took
enormous
teapot
from
the
shelf
and
put
down
the
table
front
Professor
Trelawney
Thank
you
dear
Incidentally
that
thing
you
are
dreading
will
happen
Friday
the
sixteenth
October
Lavender
trembled
Now
want
you
all
divide
into
pairs
Collect
teacup
from
the
shelf
come
and
will
fill
Then
sit
down
and
drink
drink
until
only
the
dregs
remain
Swill
these
around
the
cup
three
times
with
the
left
hand
then
turn
the
cup
upside
down
its
saucer
wait
for
the
last
the
tea
drain
away
then
give
your
cup
your
partner
read
You
will
interpret
the
patterns
using
pages
five
and
six
Unfogging
the
Future
shall
move
among
you
helping
and
instructing
and
dear
she
caught
Neville
the
arm
made
stand
after
you
broken
your
first
cup
would
you
kind
select
one
the
blue
patterned
ones
rather
attached
the
pink
Sure
enough
Neville
had
sooner
reached
the
shelf
teacups
when
there
was
tinkle
breaking
china
Professor
Trelawney
swept
over
him
holding
dustpan
and
brush
and
said
One
the
blue
ones
then
dear
you
wouldn
mind
thank
you
When
Harry
and
Ron
had
had
their
teacups
filled
they
went
back
their
table
and
tried
drink
the
scalding
tea
quickly
They
swilled
the
dregs
around
Professor
Trelawney
had
instructed
then
drained
the
cups
and
swapped
over
Right
said
Ron
they
both
opened
their
books
pages
five
and
six
What
can
you
see
mine
load
soggy
brown
stuff
said
Harry
The
heavily
perfumed
smoke
the
room
was
making
him
feel
sleepy
and
stupid
Broaden
your
minds
dears
and
allow
your
eyes
see
past
the
mundane
Professor
Trelawney
cried
through
the
gloom
Harry
tried
pull
himself
together
Right
you
got
crooked
sort
cross
consulted
Unfogging
the
Future
That
means
you
going
have
trials
and
suffering
sorry
about
that
but
there
thing
that
could
the
sun
hang
that
means
great
happiness
you
going
suffer
but
very
happy
You
need
your
Inner
Eye
tested
you
ask
said
Ron
and
they
both
had
stifle
their
laughs
Professor
Trelawney
gazed
their
direction
turn
Ron
peered
into
Harry
teacup
his
forehead
wrinkled
with
effort
There
blob
bit
like
bowler
hat
said
Maybe
you
going
work
for
the
Ministry
Magic
turned
the
teacup
the
other
way
But
this
way
looks
more
like
acorn
What
that
scanned
his
copy
Unfogging
the
Future
windfall
unexpected
gold
Excellent
you
can
lend
some
and
there
thin
here
turned
the
cup
again
that
looks
like
animal
yeah
that
was
its
head
looks
like
hippo
sheep
Professor
Trelawney
whirled
around
Harry
let
out
snort
laughter
Let
see
that
dear
she
said
reprovingly
Ron
sweeping
over
and
snatching
Harry
cup
from
him
Everyone
went
quiet
watch
Professor
Trelawney
was
staring
into
the
teacup
rotating
counterclockwise
The
falcon
dear
you
have
deadly
enemy
But
everyone
knows
that
said
Hermione
loud
whisper
Professor
Trelawney
stared
her
Well
they
said
Hermione
Everybody
knows
about
Harry
and
You
Know
Who
Harry
and
Ron
stared
her
with
mixture
amazement
and
admiration
They
had
never
heard
Hermione
speak
teacher
like
that
before
Professor
Trelawney
chose
not
reply
She
lowered
her
huge
eyes
Harry
cup
again
and
continued
turn
The
club
attack
Dear
dear
this
not
happy
cup
thought
that
was
bowler
hat
said
Ron
sheepishly
The
skull
danger
your
path
dear
Everyone
was
staring
transfixed
Professor
Trelawney
who
gave
the
cup
final
turn
gasped
and
then
screamed
There
was
another
tinkle
breaking
china
Neville
had
smashed
his
second
cup
Professor
Trelawney
sank
into
vacant
armchair
her
glittering
hand
her
heart
and
her
eyes
closed
dear
boy
poor
dear
boy
kinder
not
say
don
ask
What
Professor
said
Dean
Thomas
once
Everyone
had
got
their
feet
and
slowly
they
crowded
around
Harry
and
Ron
table
pressing
close
Professor
Trelawney
chair
get
good
look
Harry
cup
dear
Professor
Trelawney
huge
eyes
opened
dramatically
You
have
the
Grim
The
what
said
Harry
could
tell
that
wasn
the
only
one
who
didn
understand
Dean
Thomas
shrugged
him
and
Lavender
Brown
looked
puzzled
but
nearly
everybody
else
clapped
their
hands
their
mouths
horror
The
Grim
dear
the
Grim
cried
Professor
Trelawney
who
looked
shocked
that
Harry
hadn
understood
The
giant
spectral
dog
that
haunts
churchyards
dear
boy
omen
the
worst
omen
death
Harry
stomach
lurched
That
dog
the
cover
Death
Omens
Flourish
and
Blotts
the
dog
the
shadows
Magnolia
Crescent
Lavender
Brown
clapped
her
hands
her
mouth
too
Everyone
was
looking
Harry
everyone
except
Hermione
who
had
gotten
and
moved
around
the
back
Professor
Trelawney
chair
don
think
looks
like
Grim
she
said
flatly
Professor
Trelawney
surveyed
Hermione
with
mounting
dislike
You
forgive
for
saying
dear
but
perceive
very
little
aura
around
you
Very
little
receptivity
the
resonances
the
future
Seamus
Finnigan
was
tilting
his
head
from
side
side
looks
like
Grim
you
this
said
with
his
eyes
almost
shut
but
looks
more
like
donkey
from
here
said
leaning
the
left
When
you
all
finished
deciding
whether
going
die
not
said
Harry
taking
even
himself
surprise
Now
nobody
seemed
want
look
him
think
will
leave
the
lesson
here
for
today
said
Professor
Trelawney
her
mistiest
voice
Yes
please
pack
away
your
things
Silently
the
class
took
their
teacups
back
Professor
Trelawney
packed
away
their
books
and
closed
their
bags
Even
Ron
was
avoiding
Harry
eyes
Until
meet
again
said
Professor
Trelawney
faintly
fair
fortune
yours
and
dear
she
pointed
Neville
you
late
next
time
mind
you
work
extra
hard
catch
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
descended
Professor
Trelawney
ladder
and
the
winding
stair
silence
then
set
off
for
Professor
McGonagall
Transfiguration
lesson
took
them
long
find
her
classroom
that
early
they
had
left
Divination
they
were
only
just
time
Harry
chose
seat
right
the
back
the
room
feeling
though
were
sitting
very
bright
spotlight
the
rest
the
class
kept
shooting
furtive
glances
him
though
were
about
drop
dead
any
moment
hardly
heard
what
Professor
McGonagall
was
telling
them
about
Animagi
wizards
who
could
transform
will
into
animals
and
wasn
even
watching
when
she
transformed
herself
front
their
eyes
into
tabby
cat
with
spectacle
markings
around
her
eyes
Really
what
has
got
into
you
all
today
said
Professor
McGonagall
turning
back
into
herself
with
faint
pop
and
staring
around
them
all
Not
that
matters
but
that
the
first
time
transformation
not
got
applause
from
class
Everybody
heads
turned
toward
Harry
again
but
nobody
spoke
Then
Hermione
raised
her
hand
Please
Professor
just
had
our
first
Divination
class
and
were
reading
the
tea
leaves
and
course
said
Professor
McGonagall
suddenly
frowning
There
need
say
any
more
Miss
Granger
Tell
which
you
will
dying
this
year
Everyone
stared
her
said
Harry
finally
see
said
Professor
McGonagall
fixing
Harry
with
her
beady
eyes
Then
you
should
know
Potter
that
Sibyll
Trelawney
has
predicted
the
death
one
student
year
since
she
arrived
this
school
None
them
has
died
yet
Seeing
death
omens
her
favorite
way
greeting
new
class
were
not
for
the
fact
that
never
speak
ill
colleagues
Professor
McGonagall
broke
off
and
they
saw
that
her
nostrils
had
gone
white
She
went
more
calmly
Divination
one
the
most
imprecise
branches
magic
shall
not
conceal
from
you
that
have
very
little
patience
with
True
Seers
are
very
rare
and
Professor
Trelawney
She
stopped
again
and
then
said
very
matter
fact
tone
You
look
excellent
health
Potter
you
will
excuse
don
let
you
off
homework
today
assure
you
that
you
die
you
need
not
hand
Hermione
laughed
Harry
felt
bit
better
was
harder
feel
scared
lump
tea
leaves
away
from
the
dim
red
light
and
befuddling
perfume
Professor
Trelawney
classroom
Not
everyone
was
convinced
however
Ron
still
looked
worried
and
Lavender
whispered
But
what
about
Neville
cup
When
the
Transfiguration
class
had
finished
they
joined
the
crowd
thundering
toward
the
Great
Hall
for
lunch
Ron
cheer
said
Hermione
pushing
dish
stew
toward
him
You
heard
what
Professor
McGonagall
said
Ron
spooned
stew
onto
his
plate
and
picked
his
fork
but
didn
start
Harry
said
low
serious
voice
You
haven
seen
great
black
dog
anywhere
have
you
Yeah
have
said
Harry
saw
one
the
night
left
the
Dursleys
Ron
let
his
fork
fall
with
clatter
Probably
stray
said
Hermione
calmly
Ron
looked
Hermione
though
she
had
gone
mad
Hermione
Harry
seen
Grim
that
that
bad

uncle
Bilius
saw
one
and
and
died
twenty
four
hours
later
Coincidence
said
Hermione
airily
pouring
herself
some
pumpkin
juice
You
don
know
what
you
talking
about
said
Ron
starting
get
angry
Grims
scare
the
living
daylights
out
most
wizards
There
you
are
then
said
Hermione
superior
tone
They
see
the
Grim
and
die
fright
The
Grim
not
omen
the
cause
death
And
Harry
still
with
because
not
stupid
enough
see
one
and
think
right
well
better
kick
the
bucket
then
Ron
mouthed
wordlessly
Hermione
who
opened
her
bag
took
out
her
new
Arithmancy
book
and
propped
open
against
the
juice
jug
think
Divination
seems
very
woolly
she
said
searching
for
her
page
lot
guesswork
you
ask
There
was
nothing
woolly
about
the
Grim
that
cup
said
Ron
hotly
You
didn
seem
quite
confident
when
you
were
telling
Harry
was
sheep
said
Hermione
coolly
Professor
Trelawney
said
you
didn
have
the
right
aura
You
just
don
like
being
bad
something
for
change
had
touched
nerve
Hermione
slammed
her
Arithmancy
book
down
the
table
hard
that
bits
meat
and
carrot
flew
everywhere
being
good
Divination
means
have
pretend
see
death
omens
lump
tea
leaves
not
sure
studying
much
longer
That
lesson
was
absolute
rubbish
compared
with
Arithmancy
class
She
snatched
her
bag
and
stalked
away
Ron
frowned
after
her
What
she
talking
about
said
Harry
She
hasn
been
Arithmancy
class
yet
Harry
was
pleased
get
out
the
castle
after
lunch
Yesterday
rain
had
cleared
the
sky
was
clear
pale
gray
and
the
grass
was
springy
and
damp
underfoot
they
set
off
for
their
first
ever
Care
Magical
Creatures
class
Ron
and
Hermione
weren
speaking
each
other
Harry
walked
beside
them
silence
they
went
down
the
sloping
lawns
Hagrid
hut
the
edge
the
Forbidden
Forest
was
only
when
spotted
three
only
too
familiar
backs
ahead
them
that
realized
they
must
having
these
lessons
with
the
Slytherins
Malfoy
was
talking
animatedly
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
were
chortling
Harry
was
quite
sure
knew
what
they
were
talking
about
Hagrid
was
waiting
for
his
class
the
door
his
hut
stood
his
moleskin
overcoat
with
Fang
the
boarhound
his
heels
looking
impatient
start
mon
now
get

called
the
class
approached
Got

treat

Great
lesson

Everyone
here
Right
follow
For
one
nasty
moment
Harry
thought
that
Hagrid
was
going
lead
them
into
the
forest
Harry
had
had
enough
unpleasant
experiences
there
last
him
lifetime
However
Hagrid
strolled
off
around
the
edge
the
trees
and
five
minutes
later
they
found
themselves
outside
kind
paddock
There
was
nothing
there
Everyone
gather
round
the
fence
here
called
That
make
sure
yeh

How
said
the
cold
drawling
voice
Draco
Malfoy
said
Hagrid
How

books
Malfoy
repeated
took
out
his
copy
The
Monster
Book
Monsters
which
had
bound
shut
with
length
rope
Other
people
took
theirs
out
too
some
like
Harry
had
belted
their
book
shut
others
had
crammed
them
inside
tight
bags
clamped
them
together
with
binder
clips
Hasn
hasn
anyone

open
their
books
said
Hagrid
looking
crestfallen
The
class
all
shook
their
heads
Yeh
got
ter
stroke
said
Hagrid
though
this
was
the
most
obvious
thing
the
world
Look
took
Hermione
copy
and
ripped
off
the
Spellotape
that
bound
The
book
tried
bite
but
Hagrid
ran
giant
forefinger
down
its
spine
and
the
book
shivered
and
then
fell
open
and
lay
quiet
his
hand
how
silly
all
been
Malfoy
sneered
should
have
stroked
them
why
didn
guess
thought
they
were
funny
Hagrid
said
uncertainly
Hermione
tremendously
funny
said
Malfoy
Really
witty
giving
books
that
try
and
rip
our
hands
off
Shut
Malfoy
said
Harry
quietly
Hagrid
was
looking
downcast
and
Harry
wanted
Hagrid
first
lesson
success
Righ
then
said
Hagrid
who
seemed
have
lost
his
thread
yeh

books

Magical
Creatures
Yeah

Hang
strode
away
from
them
into
the
forest
and
out

God

place
going

dogs
said
Malfoy
loudly
That
oaf
teaching

Shut
Malfoy
Harry
repeated
Careful
Potter
there
dementor
behind
you
Oooooooh
squealed
Lavender
Brown
pointing
toward
the
opposite
side
the
paddock
Trotting
toward
them
were
dozen
the
most
bizarre
creatures
Harry
had
ever
seen
They
had
the
bodies
hind
legs
and
tails
horses
but
the
front
legs
wings
and
heads
what
seemed
giant
eagles
with
cruel
steel
colored
beaks
and
large
brilliantly
orange
eyes
The
talons
their
front
legs
were
half
foot
long
and
deadly
looking
Each
the
beasts
had
thick
leather
collar
around
its
neck
which
was
attached
long
chain
and
the
ends
all
these
were
held
the
vast
hands
Hagrid
who
came
jogging
into
the
paddock
behind
the
creatures
Gee
there
roared
shaking
the
chains
and
urging
the
creatures
toward
the
fence
where
the
class
stood
Everyone
drew
back
slightly
Hagrid
reached
them
and
tethered
the
creatures
the
fence
Hippogriffs
Hagrid
roared
happily
waving
hand
them
Beau
iful
aren
they
Harry
could
sort
see
what
Hagrid
meant
Once
you
got
over
the
first
shock
seeing
something
that
was
half
horse
half
bird
you
started
appreciate
the
hippogriffs
gleaming
coats
changing
smoothly
from
feather
hair
each
them
different
color
stormy
gray
bronze
pinkish
roan
gleaming
chestnut
and
inky
black
said
Hagrid
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
beaming
around
yeh
wan
ter
come
bit
nearer
one
seemed
want
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
however
approached
the
fence
cautiously
Now

they
proud
said
Hagrid
Easily
offended
hippogriffs

Don

the
last
thing
yeh
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
weren
listening
they
were
talking
undertone
and
Harry
had
nasty
feeling
they
were
plotting
how
best
disrupt
the
lesson
Yeh
always
wait
fer
the
hippogriff
ter
make
the
firs
move
Hagrid
continued
polite
see
Yeh

doesn
bow
then
get

from
him
sharpish
cause
those
talons
hurt
Right
who
wants
ter
first
Most
the
class
backed
farther
away
answer
Even
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
misgivings
The
hippogriffs
were
tossing
their
fierce
heads
and
flexing
their
powerful
wings
they
didn
seem
like
being
tethered
like
this
one
said
Hagrid
with
pleading
look
said
Harry
There
was
intake
breath
from
behind
him
and
both
Lavender
and
Parvati
whispered
Oooh
Harry
remember
your
tea
leaves
Harry
ignored
them
climbed
over
the
paddock
fence
Good
man
Harry
roared
Hagrid
Right
then
let
see
how
yeh
get
with
Buckbeak
untied
one
the
chains
pulled
the
gray
hippogriff
away
from
its
fellows
and
slipped
off
its
leather
collar
The
class
the
other
side
the
paddock
seemed
holding
its
breath
Malfoy
eyes
were
narrowed
maliciously
Easy
now
Harry
said
Hagrid
quietly
Yeh
got
eye
contact
now
try
not
ter
blink
Hippogriffs
don
trust
yeh
yeh
blink
too
much
Harry
eyes
immediately
began
water
but
didn
shut
thern
Buckbeak
had
turned
his
great
sharp
head
and
was
staring
Harry
with
one
fierce
orange
eye
Tha
said
Hagrid
Tha
Harry
now
bow
Harry
didn
feel
much
like
exposing
the
back
his
neck
Buckbeak
but
did
was
told
gave
short
bow
and
then
looked
The
hippogriff
was
still
staring
haughtily
him
didn
move
said
Hagrid
sounding
worried
Right
back
away
now
Harry
easy
does
But
then
Harry
enormous
surprise
the
hippogriff
suddenly
bent
its
scaly
front
knees
and
sank
into
what
was
unmistakable
bow
Well
done
Harry
said
Hagrid
ecstatic
Right
yeh
can
touch
him
Pat
his
beak
Feeling
that
better
reward
would
have
been
back
away
Harry
moved
slowly
toward
the
hippogriff
and
reached
out
toward
patted
the
beak
several
times
and
the
hippogriff
closed
its
eyes
lazily
though
enjoying
The
class
broke
into
applause
all
except
for
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
were
looking
deeply
disappointed
Righ
then
Harry
said
Hagrid
reckon
might
let
yeh
ride
him
This
was
more
than
Harry
had
bargained
for
was
used
broomstick
but
wasn
sure
hippogriff
would
quite
the
same
Yeh
climb
there
jus
behind
the
wing
joint
said
Hagrid
mind
yeh
don
pull
any
his
feathers
out
won
like
that
Harry
put
his
foot
the
top
Buckbeaks
wing
and
hoisted
himself
onto
its
back
Buckbeak
stood
Harry
wasn
sure
where
hold
everything
front
him
was
covered
with
feathers
then
roared
Hagrid
slapping
the
hippogriffs
hindquarters
Without
warning
twelve
foot
wings
flapped
open
either
side
Harry
just
had
time
seize
the
hippogriff
around
the
neck
before
was
soaring
upward
was
nothing
like
broomstick
and
Harry
knew
which
one
preferred
the
hippogriff
wings
beat
uncomfortably
either
side
him
catching
him
under
his
legs
and
making
him
feel
was
about
thrown
off
the
glossy
feathers
slipped
under
his
fingers
and
didn
dare
get
stronger
grip
instead
the
smooth
action
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
now
felt
himself
rocking
backward
and
forward
the
hindquarters
the
hippogriff
rose
and
fell
with
its
wings
Buckbeak
flew
him
once
around
the
paddock
and
then
headed
back
the
ground
this
was
the
bit
Harry
had
been
dreading
leaned
back
the
smooth
neck
lowered
feeling
was
going
slip
off
over
the
beak
then
felt
heavy
thud
the
four
ill
assorted
feet
hit
the
ground
just
managed
hold
and
push
himself
straight
again
Good
work
Harry
roared
Hagrid
everyone
except
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
cheered
Okay
who
else
wants
Emboldened
Harry
success
the
rest
the
class
climbed
cautiously
into
the
paddock
Hagrid
untied
the
hippogriffs
one
one
and
soon
people
were
bowing
nervously
all
over
the
paddock
Neville
ran
repeatedly
backward
from
his
which
didn
seem
want
bend
its
knees
Ron
and
Hermione
practiced
the
chestnut
while
Harry
watched
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
had
taken
over
Buckbeak
had
bowed
Malfoy
who
was
now
patting
his
beak
looking
disdainful
This
very
easy
Malfoy
drawled
loud
enough
for
Harry
hear
him
knew
must
have
been
Potter
could
bet
you
not
dangerous

said
the
hippogriff
Are

ugly

flash

Malfoy
let
out
highpitched
scream
and
next
moment
Hagrid
was
wrestling
Buckbeak
back
into
his
collar
strained
get
Malfoy
who
lay
curled
the
grass
blood
blossoming
over
his
robes
dying
Malfoy

the

panicked
dying

said
Hagrid
who
had
gone
very
white
Someone

outta

Hermione
ran
hold
open
the
gate
Hagrid
lifted
Malfoy
easily
they
passed
Harry
saw
that
there
was
long
deep
gash
Malfoy
arm
blood
splattered
the
grass
and
Hagrid
ran
with
him
the
slope
toward
the
castle
Very
shaken
the
Care
Magical
Creatures
class
followed
walk
The
Slytherins
were
all
shouting
about
Hagrid
They
should
fire
him
straight
away
said
Pansy
Parkinson
who
was
tears
was
Malfoy
fault
snapped
Dean
Thomas
Crabbe
and
Goyle
flexed
their
muscles
threateningly
They
all
climbed
the
stone
steps
into
the
deserted
entrance
hall
going
see
okay
said
Pansy
and
they
all
watched
her
run
the
marble
staircase
The
Slytherins
still
muttering
about
Hagrid
headed
away
the
direction
their
dungeon
common
room
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
proceeded
upstairs
Gryffindor
Tower
You

said
Hermione
nervously

said
Hermione
anxiously
not
touching
her
steak
and
kidney
pudding
They

Ron
who
wasn
eating
either
Harry
was
watching
the
Slytherin
table
large
group
including
Crabbe
and
Goyle
was
huddled
together
deep
conversation
Harry
was
sure
they
were
cooking
their
own
version
how
Malfoy
had
been
injured
Well
you
can
say

interesting
first
day

said
Ron
gloomily
They
went
the
crowded
Gryffindor
common
room
after
dinner
and
tried
the
homework
Professor
McGonagall
had
given
them
but
all

Pointedly

glad

front
doors

weren
entirely
sure
they
were
supposed
out
The

twilight
When

Hagrid

One

Hagrid

Hagrid

followed
Hermione
unsteadily
outside
They

Harry
nervously
Hermione

empty
tankard
Stuck

Hermione

when
the
Slytherins

How

Pansy
Parkinson

Malfoy
putting

sort
grimace
But
Harry
saw
him
wink
Crabbe
and
Goyle
when
Pansy
had
looked
away
Settle

Professor

But
Malfoy

always
been
able

with
anything
Snape

Snape

Slytherin
House
and
generality
favored
his
own
students
above
all
others
They
were
making

potion
today
Shrinking
Solution
Malfoy
set
his
cauldron
right
next
Harry
and
Ron

across
the
table

Ron
seized
his
knife

Malfoy
roots
toward

Snape
approached
their
table
stared
down
his
hooked
nose
the
roots
then
gave
Ron
unpleasant
smile
from
beneath
his
long
greasy
black
hair
Change

Malfoy
Weasley
But
sit
Ron
had
spent
the
last
quarter
hour
carefully
shredding
his
own
roots
into
exactly
equal
pieces
Now
said
Snape
his
most
dangerous
voice
Ron
shoved
his
own
beautifully
cut
roots
across
the
table
Malfoy
then
took
the
knife
again
And

Malfoy
his
voice
full
malicious
laughter
Potter

said
Snape
giving
Harry
the
look
loathing
always
reserved
just
for
him
Harry

Ron

trying
repair
the
damage

roots

had
use
Harry
skinned
the
shrivelfig

and
flung
back
across
the
table
Malfoy
without

Malfoy
was
smirking
more
broadly
than
ever
Seen

Ron
jerkily
without

Ron

Neville

Neville
regularly

Potions

his
worst
subject
and
his
great
fear
Professor
Snape
made
things
ten
times
worse
His
potion

was
supposed

acid
green
had
turned
Orange
Longbottom

Snape
ladling
some
and
allowing

into
the

that

Neville
Longbottom

drops
this
potion

Perhaps

Snape
moved
away
leaving
Neville
breathless
with
fear
Help

Harry
and
Ron
quickly
the
other
side
the
table
Malfoy
looked
listening
closely
Not
too
far
from

said
Seamus
who
looked
excited

Ron
repeated
looking
significantly
Harry
turned
around
and
saw
Malfoy
watching
closely
What
Malfoy
Need
something
else
skinned
But
Malfoy
eyes
were
shining
malevolently
and
they
were
fixed
Harry
leaned
across
the
table
Black
single
handed
Potter
Thinking
trying

Harry
offhandedly
Malfoys

Ron
roughly

Malfoy
his

eyes
narrowed

Harry
angrily
but
that
moment
Snape
called

Longbottom
Crabbe
and
Goyle
laughed
openly
watching
Neville
sweat
stirred
his
potion
feverishly
Hermione
was
muttering
instructions
him
out
the
corner
her
mouth
that
Snape
wouldn
see
Harry
and
Ron
packed
away
their
unused
ingredients
and
went
wash
their
hands
and
ladles
the
stone
basin
the
corner
What
did
Malfoy
mean
Harry
muttered
Ron
stuck
his
hands
under
the
icy
jet
that
poured
from
the
gargoyle
mouth
Why
would
want
revenge
Black
hasn
done
anything
yet
making
said
Ron
savagely
trying
make
you
something
stupid
The
end
the
lesson
sight
Snape
strode
over
Neville
who
was
cowering
his
cauldron
Everyone

round
said
Snape
his
black
eyes
glittering
and
watch
what
happens
Longbottom

his

The
Gryffindors
watched
fearfully
The
Slytherins
looked
excited
Snape
picked
Trevor
the
toad
his
left
hand
and
dipped
small
spoon
into
Neville
potion
which
was
now
green
trickled
few
drops
down
Trevor
throat
There
was
moment
hushed
silence
which
Trevor
gulped
then
there
was
small
pop
and
Trevor
the
tadpole
was
wriggling
Snape
palm
The
Gryffindors
burst
into
applause
Snape
looking
sour
pulled
small
bottle
from
the
pocket
his
robe
poured
few
drops
top
Trevor
and
reappeared
suddenly
fully
grown
Five
points
from
Gryffindor
said
Snape
which
wiped
the
smiles
from
every
face
told
you
not
help
him
Miss
Granger
Class
dismissed
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
climbed
the
steps
the
entrance
hall
Harry
was
still
thinking
about
what
Malfoy
had
said
while
Ron
was
seething
about
Snape
Five
points
from
Gryffindor
because
the
potion
was
all
right
Why
didn
You
lie
Hermione
You
should
said
Neville
did
all
himself
Hermione
didn
answer
Ron
looked
around
Where
she
Harry
turned
too
They
were
the
top
the
steps
now
watching
the
rest
the
class
pass
them
heading
for
the
Great
Hall
and
lunch
She
was
right
behind
said
Ron
frowning
Malfoy
passed
them
walking
between
Crabbe
and
Goyle
smirked
Harry
and
disappeared
There
she
said
Harry
Hermione
was
panting
slightly
hurrying
the
stairs
one
hand
clutched
her
bag
the
other
seemed
tucking
something
down
the
front
her
robes
How
did
you
that
said
Ron
What
said
Hermione
joining
them
One
minute
you
were
right
behind
the
next
moment
you
were
back
the
bottom
the
stairs
again
What
Hermione
looked
slightly
confused
had
back
for
something
seam
had
split
Hermione
bag
Harry
wasn
surprised
could
see
that
was
crammed
with
least
dozen
large
and
heavy
books
Why
are
you
carrying
all
these
around
with
you
Ron
asked
her
You
know
how
many
subjects
taking
said
Hermione
breathlessly
Couldn
hold
these
for
could
you
But
Ron
was
turning
over
the
books
she
had
handed
him
looking
the
covers
You
havent
got
any
these
subjects
today
only
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
this
afternoon
yes
said
Hermione
vaguely
but
she
packed
all
the
books
back
into
her
bag
just
the
same
hope
there
something
good
for
lunch
starving
she
added
and
she
marched
off
toward
the
Great
Hall
you
get
the
feeling
Hermione
not
telling
something
Ron
asked
Harry
Professor
Lupin
wasn
there
when
they
arrived
his
first
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
They
all
sat
down
took
out
their
books
quills
and
parchment
and
were
talking
when
finally
entered
the
room
Lupin
smiled
vaguely
and
placed
his
tatty
old
briefcase
the
teacher
desk
was
shabby
ever
but
looked
healthier
than
had
the
train
though
had
had
few
square
meals
Good
afternoon
said
Would
you
please
put
all
your
books
back
your
bags
Today
will
practical
lesson
You
will
need
only
your
wands
few
curious
looks
were
exchanged
the
class
put
away
their
books
They
had
never
had
practical
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
before
unless
you
counted
the
memorable
class
last
year
when
their
old
teacher
had
brought
cageful
pixies
class
and
set
them
loose
Right
then
said
Professor
Lupin
when
everyone
was
ready
you
follow
Puzzled
but
interested
the
class
got
its
feet
and
followed
Professor
Lupin
out
the
classroom
led
them
along
the
deserted
corridor
and
around
corner
where
the
first
thing
they
saw
was
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
who
was
floating
upside
down
midair
and
stuffing
the
nearest
keyhole
with
chewing
gum
Peeves
didn
look
until
Professor
Lupin
was
two
feet
away
hen
wiggled
his
curly
toed
feet
and
broke
into
song
Loony
loopy
Lupin
Peeves
sang
Loony
loopy
Lupin
loony
loopy
Lupin
Rude
and
unmanageable
almost
always
was
Peeves
usually
showed
some
respect
toward
the
teachers
Everyone
looked
quickly
Professor
Lupin
see
how
would
take
this
their
surprise
was
still
smiling
take
that
gum
out
the
keyhole
were
you
Peeves
said
pleasantly
Filch
won
able
get
his
brooms
Filch
was
the
Hogwarts
caretaker
bad
tempered
failed
wizard
who
waged
constant
war
against
the
students
and
indeed
Peeves
However
Peeves
paid
attention
Professor
Lupin
words
except
blow
loud
wet
raspberry
Professor
Lupin
gave
small
sigh
and
took
out
his
wand
This
useful
little
spell
told
the
class
over
his
shoulder
Please
watch
closely
raised
the
wand
shoulder
height
said
Waddiwasi
and
pointed
Peeves
With
the
force
bullet
the
wad
chewing
gum
shot
out
the
keyhole
and
straight
down
Peeves
left
nostril
whirled
upright
and
zoomed
away
cursing
Cool
sit
said
Dean
Thomas
amazement
Thank
you
Dean
said
Professor
Lupin
putting
his
wand
away
again
Shall
proceed
They
set
off
again
the
class
looking
shabby
Professor
Lupin
with
increased
respect
led
them
down
second
corridor
and
stopped
right
outside
the
staffroom
door
Inside
please
said
Professor
Lupin
opening
and
standing
back
The
staffroom
long
paneled
room
full
old
mismatched
chairs
was
empty
except
for
one
teacher
Professor
Snape
was
sitting
low
armchair
and
looked
around
the
class
filed
His
eyes
were
glittering
and
there
was
nasty
sneer
playing
around
his
mouth
Professor
Lupin
came
and
made
close
the
door
behind
him
Snape
said
Leave
open
Lupin
rather
not
witness
this
got
his
feet
and
strode
past
the
class
his
black
robes
billowing
behind
him
the
doorway
turned
his
heel
and
said
Possibly
one
warned
you
Lupin
but
this
class
contains
Neville
Longbottom
would
advise
you
not
entrust
him
with
anything
difficult
Not
unless
Miss
Granger
hissing
instructions
his
ear
Neville
went
scarlet
Harry
glared
Snape
was
bad
enough
that
bullied
Neville
his
own
classes
let
alone
doing
front
other
teachers
Professor
Lupin
had
raised
his
eyebrows
was
hoping
that
Neville
would
assist
with
the
first
stage
the
operation
said
and
sure
will
perform
admirably
Neville
face
went
possible
even
redder
Snape
lip
curled
but
left
shutting
the
door
with
snap
Now
then
said
Professor
Lupin
beckoning
the
class
toward
the
end
the
room
where
there
was
nothing
but
old
wardrobe
where
the
teachers
kept
their
spare
robes
Professor
Lupin
went
stand
next
the
wardrobe
gave
sudden
wobble
banging
off
the
wall
Nothing
worry
about
said
Professor
Lupin
calmly
because
few
people
had
jumped
backward
alarm
There
boggart
there
Most
people
seemed
feel
that
this
was
something
worry
about
Neville
gave
Professor
Lupin
look
pure
terror
and
Seamus
Finnigan
eyed
the
now
rattling
doorknob
apprehensively
Boggarts
like
dark
enclosed
spaces
said
Professor
Lupin
Wardrobes
the
gap
beneath
beds
the
cupboards
under
sinks
even
met
one
that
had
lodged
itself
grandfather
clock
This
one
moved
yesterday
afternoon
and
asked
the
headmaster
the
staff
would
leave
give
third
years
some
practice
the
first
question
must
ask
ourselves
what
boggart
Hermione
put
her
hand
shape
shifter
she
said
can
take
the
shape
whatever
thinks
will
frighten
most
Couldn
have
put
better
myself
said
Professor
Lupin
and
Hermione
glowed
the
boggart
sitting
the
darkness
within
has
not
yet
assumed
form
does
not
yet
know
what
will
frighten
the
person
the
other
side
the
door
Nobody
knows
what
boggart
looks
like
when
alone
but
when
let
him
out
will
immediately
become
whatever
each
most
fears
This
means
said
Professor
Lupin
choosing
ignore
Neville
mall
sputter
terror
that
have
huge
advantage
over
the
boggart
before
begin
Have
you
spotted
Harry
Trying
answer
question
with
Hermione
next
him
bobbing
and
down
the
balls
her
feet
with
her
hand
the
air
was
very
off
putting
but
Harry
had
because
there
are
many
won
know
what
shape
should
Precisely
said
Professor
Lupin
and
Hermione
put
her
hand
down
looking
little
disappointed
always
best
have
com
pany
when
you
dealing
with
boggart
becomes
confused
Which
should
become
headless
corpse
flesh
eating
slug
once
saw
boggart
make
that
very
mistake
tried
frighten
two
people
once
and
turned
himself
into
half
slug
Not
remotely
frightening
The
charm
that
repels
boggart
simple
yet
requires
force
mind
You
see
the
thing
that
really
finishes
boggart
laughter
What
you
need
force
assume
shape
that
you
find
amusing
will
practice
the
charm
without
wands
first
After
please
Riddikulus
Riddikulus
said
the
class
together
Good
said
Professor
Lupin
Very
good
But
that
was
the
easy
part
afraid
You
see
the
word
alone
not
enough
And
this
where
you
come
Neville
The
wardrobe
shook
again
though
not
much
Neville
who
walked
forward
though
were
heading
for
the
gallows
Right
Neville
said
Professor
Lupin
First
things
first
what
would
you
say
the
thing
that
frightens
you
most
the
world
Neville
lips
moved
but
noise
came
out
didn
catch
that
Neville
sorry
said
Professor
Lupin
cheerfully
Neville
looked
around
rather
wildly
though
begging
someone
help
him
then
said
barely
more
than
whisper
Professor
Snape
Nearly
everyone
laughed
Even
Neville
grinned
apologetically
Professor
Lupin
however
looked
thoughtful
Professor
Snape
hmmm
Neville
believe
you
live
with
your
grandmother
yes
said
Neville
nervously
But
don
want
the
boggart
turn
into
her
either
you
misunderstand
said
Professor
Lupin
now
smiling
wonder
could
you
tell
what
sort
clothes
your
grandmother
usually
wears
Neville
looked
startled
but
said
Well
always
the
same
hat
tall
one
with
stuffed
vulture
top
And
long
dress
green
normally
and
sometimes
fox
fur
scarf
And
handbag
prompted
Professor
Lupin
big
red
one
said
Neville
Right
then
said
Professor
Lupin
Can
you
picture
those
clothes
very
clearly
Neville
Can
you
see
them
your
mind
eye
Yes
said
Neville
uncertainty
plainly
wondering
what
was
coming
next
When
the
boggart
bursts
out
this
wardrobe
Neville
and
sees
You
will
assume
the
form
Professor
Snape
said
Lupin
And
You
will
raise
your
wand
thus
and
cry
Riddikulus
and
concentrate
hard
your
grandmother
clothes
all
goes
well
Professor
Boggart
Snape
will
forced
into
that
vulture
topped
hat
and
that
green
dress
with
that
big
red
handbag
There
was
great
shout
laughter
The
wardrobe
wobbled
more
violently
Neville
successful
the
boggart
likely
shift
his
attention
each
turn
said
Professor
Lupin
would
like
all
you
take
moment
now
think
the
thing
that
scares
you
most
and
imagine
how
you
might
force
look
comical
The
room
went
quiet
Harry
thought
What
scared
him
most
the
world
His
first
thought
was
Lord
Voldemort
Voldemort
returned
full
strength
But
before
had
even
started
plan
possible
counterattack
boggart
Voldemort
horrible
image
came
floating
the
surface
his
mind
rotting
glistening
hand
slithering
back
beneath
black
cloak
long
rattling
breath
from
unseen
mouth
then
cold
penetrating
felt
like
drowning
Harry
shivered
then
looked
around
hoping
one
had
noticed
Many
people
had
their
eyes
shut
tight
Ron
was
muttering
himself
Take
its
legs
off
Harry
was
sure
knew
what
that
was
about
Ron
greatest
fear
was
spiders
Everyone
ready
said
Professor
Lupin
Harry
felt
lurch
fear
wasn
ready
How
could
you
make
dementor
less
frightening
But
didn
want
ask
for
more
time
everyone
else
was
nodding
and
rolling
their
sleeves
Neville
going
back
away
said
Professor
Lupin
Let
you
have
clear
field
all
right
call
the
next
person
forward
Everyone
back
now
Neville
can
get
clear
shot
They
all
retreated
backed
against
the
walls
leaving
Neville
alone
beside
the
wardrobe
looked
pale
and
frightened
but
had
pushed
the
sleeves
his
robes
and
was
holding
his
wand
ready
the
count
three
Neville
said
Professor
Lupin
who
was
pointing
his
own
wand
the
handle
the
wardrobe
One
two
three
now
jet
sparks
shot
from
the
end
Professor
Lupin
wand
and
hit
the
doorknob
The
wardrobe
burst
open
Hook
nosed
and

Professor
Snape
stepped
out
his
eyes
flashing
Neville
Neville
backed
away
his
wand
mouthing
wordlessly
Snape
was
bearing
down
upon
him
reaching
inside
his
robes
riddikulus
squeaked
Neville
There
was
noise
like
whip
crack
Snape
stumbled
was
wearing
long
lace
trimmed
dress
and
towering
hat
topped
with
moth
eaten
vulture
and
was
swinging
huge
crimson
handbag
There
was
roar
laughter
the
boggart
paused
confused
and
Professor
Lupin
shouted
Parvati
Forward
Parvati
walked
forward
her
face
set
Snape
rounded
her
There
was
another
crack
and
where
had
stood
was
bloodstained
bandaged
mummy
its
sightless
face
was
turned
Parvati
and
began
walk
toward
her
very
slowly
dragging
its
feet
its
stiff
arms
rising
Riddikulus
cried
Parvati
bandage
unraveled
the
mummy

face
forward
and
its
head
rolled
off
Seamus
roared
Professor
Lupin
Seamus
darted
past
Parvati
Crack
Where
the
mummy
had
been
was
woman
with
floorlength
black
hair
and
skeletal
green
tinged
face
banshee
She
opened
her
mouth
wide
and
unearthly
sound
filled
the
room
long
wailing
shriek
that
made
the
hair
Harry
head
stand
end
Riddikulus
shouted
Seamus
The
banshee
made
rasping
noise
and
clutched
her
throat
her
voice
was
gone
Crack
The
banshee
turned
into
rat
which
chased
its
tail
circle
then
crack
became
rattlesnake
which
slithered
and
writhed
before
crack
becoming
single
bloody
eyeball
confused
shouted
Lupin
getting
there
Dean
Dean
hurried
forward
Crack
The
eyeball
became
severed
hand
which
flipped
over
and
began
creep
along
the
floor
like
crab
Riddikulus
yelled
Dean
There
was
snap
and
the
hand
was
trapped
mousetrap
Excellent
Ron

Ron
leapt
forward
Crack
Quite
few
people
screamed
giant
spider
six
feet
tall
and
covered
hair
was
advancing
Ron
clicking
its
pincers
menacingly
For
moment
Harry
thought
Ron
had
frozen
Then
Riddikulus
bellowed
Ron
and
the
spider
legs
vanished
rolled
over
and
over
Lavender
Brown
squealed
and
ran
out
its
way
and
came
halt
Harry
feet
raised
his
wand
ready
but
Here
shouted
Professor
Lupin
suddenly
hurrying
forward
Crack
The
legless
spider
had
vanished
For
second
everyone
looked
wildly
around
see
where
was
Then
they
saw
silvery
white
orb
hanging
the
air
front
Lupin
who
said
Riddikulus
almosi
lazily
Crack
Forward
Neville
and
finish
him
off
said
Lupin
the
boggart
landed
the
floor
cockroach
Crack
Snape
was
back
This
time
Neville
charged
forward
looking
determined
Riddikulus
shouted
and
they
had
split
second
view
Snape
his
lacy
dress
before
Neville
let
out
great
laughter
and
the
boggart
exploded
burst
into
thousand
tiny
wisps
smoke
and
was
gone
Excellent
cried
Professor
Lupin
the
class
broke
into
applause
Excellent
Neville

Hermione
and
Harry
But

Harry
You

Hermione

Harry
Lupin
said
lightly
Very
well

Homework

Monday
That
will
all
Talking
excitedly
the
class
left
the
staffroom
Harry
however
wasn
feeling
cheerful
Professor
Lupin
had
deliberately
stopped
him
from
tackling
the
boggart
Why
Was
because
seen
Harry
collapse
the
train
and
thought
wasn
much
Had
thought
Harry
would
pass
out
again
But
one
else
seemed
have
noticed
anything
Did
you
see
take
that
banshee
shouted
Seamus
And
the
hand
said
Dean
waving
his
own
around
And
Snape

hat
And

Professor
Lupin

Lavender
thoughtfully

said
Ron
excitedly
they
made
their
way
back
the
classroom
get
their
bags

like
very
good
teacher
said
Hermione
approvingly
But
wish
could
have
had

with
the
boggart
What
would
have
been
for
you

Ron
sniggering
piece
homework
that
only

CHAPTER
EIGHT
FLIGHT
THE
FAT
FADY
time
all
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
had
become
most
people
favorite
class
Only
Draco
Malfoy
and
his
gang
Slytherins
had
anything
bad
say
about
Professor
Lupin
Look
the
state
his
robes
Malfoy
would
say
loud
whisper
Professor
Lupin
passed
dresses
like
our
old
houseelf
But
one
else
cared
that
Professor
Lupin
robes
were
patched
and
frayed
His
next
few
lessons
were
just
interesting
the
first
After
boggarts
they
studied
Red
Caps
nasty
little
goblin
like
creatures
that
lurked
wherever
there
had
been
bloodshed
the
dungeons
castles
and
the
potholes
deserted
battlefields
waiting
bludgeon
those
who
had
gotten
lost
From
Red
Caps
they
moved
kappas
creepy
water
dwellers
that
looked
like
scaly
monkeys
with
webbed
hands
itching
strangle
unwitting
waders
their
ponds
Harry
only
wished
was
happy
with
some
his
other
classes
Worst
all
was
Potions
Snape
was
particularly
vindictive
mood
these
days
and
one
was
any
doubt
why
The
story
the
boggart
assuming
Snape
shape
and
the
way
that
Neville
had
dressed
his
grandmother
clothes
had
traveled
through
the
school
like
wildfire
Snape
didn
seem
find
funny
His
eyes
flashed
menacingly
the
very
mention
Professor
Lupin
name
and
was
bullying
Neville
worse
than
ever
Harry
was
also
growing
dread
the
hours
spent
Professor
Trelawney
stifling
tower
room
deciphering
lopsided
shapes
and
symbols
trying
ignore
the
way
Professor
Trelawney
enormous
eyes
filled
with
tears
every
time
she
looked
him
couldn
like
Professer
Trelawney
even
though
she
was
treated
with
respect
bordering
reverence
many
the
class
Parvati
Patil
and
Lavender
Brown
had
taken
haunting
Professor
Trelawney
tower
room
lunch
times
and
always
returned
with
annoyingly
superior
looks
their
faces
though
they
knew
things
the
others
didn
They
had
also
started
using
hushed
voices
whenever
they
spoke
Harry
though
were
his
deathbed
Nobody
really
liked
Care
Magical
Creatures
which
after
the
action
packed
first
class
had
become
extremely
dull
Hagrid
seemed
have
lost
his
confidence
They
were
now
spending
lesson
after
lesson
learning
how
look
after
flobberworms
which
had
some
the
most
boring
creatures
existence
Why
would
anyone
bother
looking
after
them
said
Ron
after
yet
another
hour
poking
shredded
lettuce
down
the
flobberworms
throats
the
start
October
however
Harry
had
something
else
occupy
him
something
enjoyable
more
than
made
for
his
unsatisfactory
classes
The
Quidditch
season
was
approaching
and
O1iver
Wood
Captain
the
Gryffindor
team
called
meeting
Thursday

There
were

high
hoops
each
end
the
field
two
Beaters
who
were
equipped
with
heavy
bats
repel
the
Bludgers
two
heavy
black
balls
that
zoomed
around
trying
attack
the
players
Keeper
who
defended
the
goal
posts
and
the
Seeker
who
had
the
hardest
job
all
that
catching
the
Golden
Snitch
tiny
winged
walnut
sized
ball
whose
capture
ended
the
game
and
earned
the
Seeker
team
extra
one
hundred
and
fifty
points
Oliver
Wood
was
burly
seventeen
year
old
now
his
seventh
and
final
year
Hogwarts
There
was
quiet
sort
desperation
his
voice
addressed
his
six
fellow
team
members
the
chilly
locker
rooms
the
edge
the
darkening
Quidditch
field
This
our
last
chance

the
Quidditch
Cup
told
them
striding
and
down
front
them
leaving
the
end
this
year
never

another
shot

won
for
seven
years
now
Okay

the
worst
luck
the
world

tournamentgetting
called

Wood
swallowed
though
the
memory
still
brought
lump
his
throat
But
also
know

the
best
ruddy
team
the
school
said
punching
fist
into
his
other

old
manic
glint

three
superb
Chasers
Wood

Alicia
Spinner
Angelina

and
Katie

Beaters
Stop

Fred
and
George
Weasley
together
pretending
blush
And
got
Seeker
who
has
never
failed
win

Wood
rumbled
glaring
Harry
with
kind
furious
pride
And
added
afterthought
think
you
very
good
too
Oliver
said
George
Spanking
good
Keeper
said
Fred
The
point
Wood
went
resuming
his
pacing
the
Quidditch
Cup
should
have
had
our
name
these
last
two
years
Ever
since
Harry
joined
the
team
thought
the
thing
was
the
bag
But
haven
got
and
this
year
the
last
chance
get
finally
see
our
name
the
thing
Wood
spoke
dejectedly
that
even
Fred
and
George
looked
sympathetic
Oliver
this
year
our
year
said
Fred
Oliver
said
Angelina
Definitely
said
Harry
Full
determination
the
team
started
training
sessions
three
evenings
week
The
weather
was
getting
colder
and
wetter
the
nights
darker
but
amount
mud
wind
rain
could
tarnish
Harry
wonderful
vision
finally
winning
the
huge
silver
Quidditch
Cup
Harry
returned
the
Gryffindor
common
room
one
evening
after
training
cold
and
stiff
but
pleased
with
the
way
practice
had
gone
find
the
room
buzzing
excitedly
What
happened
asked
Ron
and
Hermione
who
were
sitting
two
the
best
chairs
the
fireside
and
completing
some
star
charts
for
Astronomy
First
Hogsmeade
weekend
said
Ron
pointing
notice
that
had
appeared
the
battered
old
bulletin

Fred

Harry

Zonko
nearly
out
Stink
Pellets
Harry
threw
himself
into
chair
beside
Ron
his
high
spirits
ebbing
away
Hermione
seemed
read
his
mind
Harry
sure

next
time
she
said
They
bound

Black

sighted

already
Black

Hogsmeade
said
Ron
Ask
McGonagall

time
Harry
The
next
one

not
for
ages
Ron
said
Hermione
Harry
supposed

school
can
the
only
third
year
left
behind
said
Ron
Ask
McGonagall
Harry
Yeah
think
will
said
Harry
making
his
mind
Hermione
opened
her
mouth
argue
but
that
moment
Crookshanks
leapt
lightly
onto
her
lap
large
dead
spider
was
dangling
from
his
mouth
Does
have
eat
that
front
said
Ron
scowling
Clever
Crookshanks
did
you
catch
that
all
yourself
said
Hermione
Crookshanks
slowly
chewed
the
spider
his
yellow
eyes
fixed
insolently
Ron
Just
keep
him
over
there
that
all
said
Ron
irritably
turning
back
his
star
chart
got
Scabbers
asleep
bag
Harry
yawned
really
wanted
bed
but
still
had
his
own
star
chart
complete
pulled
his
bag
toward
him
took
out
parchment
ink
and
quill
and
started
work
You
can
copy
mine
you
like
said
Ron
labeling
his
last
star
with
flourish
and
shoving
the
chart
toward
Harry
Hermione
who
disapproved
copying
pursed
her
lips
but
didn
say
anything
Crookshanks
was
still
staring
unblinkingly
Ron
flicking
the
end
his
bushy
tail
Then
without
warning
pounced
Ron
roared
seizing
his
bag
Crookshanks
sank
four
sets
claws
deep
inside
and
began
tearing
ferociously
GET
OFF
YOU
STUPID
ANIMAL
Ron
tried
pull
the
bag
away
from
Crookshanks
but
Crookshanks
clung
spitting
and
slashing
Ron
don
hurt
him
squealed
Hermione
the
whole
common
room
was
watching
Ron
whirled
the
bag
around
Crookshanks
still
clinging
and
Scabbers
came
flying
out
the
top
CATCH
THAT
CAR
Ron
yelled
Crookshanks
freed
himself
from
the
remnants
the
bag
sprang
over
the
table
and
chased
after
the
terrified
Scabbers
George
Weasley
made
lunge
for
Crookshanks
but
missed
Scabbers
streaked
through
twenty
pairs
legs
and
shot
beneath
old
chest
drawers
Crookshanks
skidded
halt
crouched
low
his
bandy
legs
and
started
making
furious
swipes
beneath
with
his
front
paw
Ron
and
Hermione
hurried
over
Hermione
grabbed
Crookshanks
around
the
middle
and
heaved
him
away
Ron
threw
himself
onto
his
stomach
and
with
great
difficulty
pulled
Scabbers
out
the
tail
Look
him
said
furiously
Hermione
dangling
Scabbers
front
her
skin
and
bone
You
keep
that
cat
away
from
him
Crookshanks
doesn
understand
wrong
said
Hermione
her
voice
shaking
All
cats
chase
rats
Ron
There
something
funny
about
that
animal
said
Ron
who
was
trying
persuade
frantically
wiggling
Scabbers
back
into
his
pocket
heard
say
that
Scabbers
was
bag
what
rubbish
said
Hermione
impatiently
Crookshanks
could
smell
him
Ron
how
else
you
think
That
cat
got
for
Scabbers
said
Ron
ignoring
the
people
around
him
who
were
starting
giggle
And
Scabbers
was
here
first
and
ill
Ron
marched
through
the
common
room
and
out
sight
the
stairs
the
boys
dormitories
Ron
was
still
bad
mood
with
Hermione
next
day
barely
talked
her
all
through
Herbology
even
though
Harry
and
Hermione
were
working
together
the
same
puffapod
How
Scabbers
Hermione
asked
timidly
they
stripped
fat
pink
pods
from
the
plants
and
emptied
the
shining
beans
into
wooden
pail
hiding
the
bottom
bed
shaking
said
Ron
angrily
missing
the
pail
and
scattering
beans
over
the
greenhouse
floor
Careful
Weasley
careful
cried
Professor
Sprout
the
beans
burst
into
bloom
before
their
very
eyes
They
had
Transfiguration
next
Harry
who
had
resolved
ask
Professor
McGonagall
after
the
lesson
whether
could
into
Hogsmeade
with
the
rest
joined
the
line
outside
the
class
trying
decide
how
was
going
argue
his
case
was
distracted
however
disturbance
the
front
the
line
Lavender
Brown
seemed
crying
Parvati
had
her
arm
around
her
and
was
explaining
something
Seamus
Finnigan
and
Dean
Thomas
who
were
looking
very
serious
What
the
matter
Lavender
said
Hermione
anxiously
she
Harry
and
Ron
went
join
the
group
She
got
letter
from
home
this
morning
Parvati
whispered
her
rabbit
Binky
been
killed
fox
said
Hermione
sorry
Lavender
should
have
known
said
Lavender
tragically
You
know
what
day
The
sixteenth
October
That
thing
you
dreading
will
happen
the
sixteenth
October
Remember
She
was
right
she
was
right
The
whole
class
was
gathered
around
Lavender
now
Seamus
shook
his
head
seriously
Hermione
hesitated
then
she
said
You
you
were
dreading
Binky
being
killed
fox
Well
not
necessarily
fox
said
Lavender
looking
Hermione
with
streaming
eyes
but
was
obviously
dreading
him
dying
wasn
said
Hermione
She
paused
again
Then
Was
Binky
old
rabbit
sobbed
Lavender
was
only
baby
Parvati
tightened
her
arm
around
Lavender
shoulders
But
then
why
would
you
dread
him
dying
said
Hermione
Parvati
glared
her
Well
look
logically
said
Hermione
turning
the
rest
the
group
mean
Binky
didn
even
die
today
did
Lavender
just
got
the
news
today
Lavender
wailed
loudly
and
she
can
have
been
dreading
because
come
real
shock
Don
mind
Hermione
Lavender
said
Ron
loudly
she
doesn
think
other
people
pets
matter
very
much
Professor
McGonagall
opened
the
classroom
door
that
moment
which
was
perhaps
lucky
Hermione
and
Ron
were
looking
daggers
each
other
and
when
they
got
into
class
they
seated
themselves
either
side
Harry
and
didn
talk
each
other
for
the
whole
class
Harry
still
hadn
decided
what
was
going
say
Professor
McGonagall
when
the
bell
rang
the
end
the
lesson
but
was
she
who
brought
the
subject
Hogsmeade
first
One
moment
please
she
called
the
class
made
leave
you
all
House
you
should
hand
Hogsmeade
permission
forms
before
Halloween
form
visiting
the
village
don
forget
Neville
put
his
hand
Please
Professor
think
lost
Your
grandmother
sent
yours
directly
Longbottom
said
Professor
McGonagall
She
seemed
think
was
safer
Well
that
all
you
may
leave
Ask
her
now
Ron
hissed
Harry
but
Hermione
began
for
Harry
said
Ron
stubbornly
Harry
waited
for
the
rest
the
class
disappear
then
headed
nervously
for
Professor
McGonagall
desk
Yes
Potter
Harry
took
deep
breath
Professor
aunt
and
uncle
forgot
sign
form
said
Professor
McGonagall
looked
over
her
square
spectacles
him
but
didn
say
anything
you
think
would
all
right
mean
will
okay
Hogsmeade
Professor
McGonagall
looked
down
and
began
shuffling
papers
her
desk
afraid
not
Potter
she
said
You
heard
what
said
form
visiting
the
village
That
the
rule
But
Professor
aunt
and
uncle
you
know
they
Muggles
they
don
really
understand
about
about
Hogwarts
forms
and
stuff
Harry
said
while
Ron
egged
him
with
vigorous
nods
you
said
could
But
don
say
said
Professor
McGonagall
standing
and
piling
her
papers
neatly
into
drawer
The
form
clearly
states
that
the
parent
guardian
must
give
permission
She
turned
look
him
with
odd
expression
her
face
Was
pity
sorry
Potter
but
that
final
word
You
had
better
hurry
you
late
for
your
next
lesson
There
was
nothing
done
Ron
called
Professor
McGonagall
lot
names
that
greatly
annoyed
Hermione
Hermione
assumed
all
for
the
best
expression
that
made
Ron
even
angrier
and
Harry
had
endure
everyone
the
class
talking
loudly
and
happily
about
what
they
were
going
first
once
they
got
into
Hogsmeade
There
always
the
feast
said
Ron
effort
cheer
Harry
You
know
the
Halloween
feast
the
evening
Yeah
said
Harry
gloomily
great
The
Halloween
feast
was
always
good
but
would
taste
lot
better
was
coming
after
day
Hogsmeade
with
everyone
else
Nothing
anyone
said
made
him
feel
any
better
about
being
left
behind
Dean
Thomas
who
was
good
with
quill
had
offered
forge
Uncle
Vernon
signature
the
form
but
Harry
had
already
told
Professor
McGonagall
hadn
had
signed
that
was
good
Ron
halfheartedly
suggested
the
Invisibility
Cloak
but
Hermione
stamped
that
one
reminding
Ron
what
Dumbledore
had
told
them
about
the
dementors
being
able
see
through
them
Percy
had
what
were
possibly
the
least
helpful
words
comfort
They
make
fuss
about
Hogsmeade
but
assure
you
Harry
not
all
cracked
said
seriously
All
right
the
sweetshop
rather
good
and
Zonko
Joke
Shop
frankly
dangerous
and
yes
the
Shrieking
Shack
always
worth
visit
but
really
Harry
apart
from
that
you
not
missing
anything
Halloween
morning
Harry
awoke
with
the
rest
and
went
down
breakfast
feeling
thoroughly
depressed
though
doing
his
best
act
normally
bring
you
lots
sweets
back
from
Honeydukes
said
Hermione
looking
desperately
sorry
for
him
Yeah
loads
said
Ron
and
Hermione
had
finally
forgotten
their
squabble
about
Crookshanks
the
face
Harry
difficulties
Don
worry
about
said
Harry
what
hoped
was
offhand
voice
see
you
the
feast
Have
good
time
accompanied
them
the
entrance
hall
where
Filch
the
caretaker
was
standing
inside
the
front
doors
checking
off
names
against
long
list
peering
suspiciously
into
every
face
and
making
sure
that
one
was
sneaking
out
who
shouldn
going
Staying
here
Potter
shouted
Malfoy
who
was
standing
line
with
Crabbe
and
Goyle
Scared
passing
the
dementors
Harry
ignored
him
and
made
his
solitary
way
the
marble
staircase
through
the
deserted
corridors
and
back
Gryffindor
Tower
Password
said
the
Fat
Lady
jerking
out
doze
Fortuna
Major
said
Harry
listlessly
The
portrait
swung
open
and
climbed
through
the
hole
into
the
common
room
was
full
chattering
first
and
second
years
and
few
older
students
who
had
obviously
visited
Hogsmeade
often
the
novelty
had
worn
off
Harry
Harry
Harry
was
Colin
Creevey
second
year
who
was
deeply
awe
Harry
and
never
missed
opportunity
speak
him
Aren
you
going
Hogsmeade
Harry
Why
not
Hey
Colin
looked
eagerly
around
his
friends
you
can
come
and
sit
with
you
like
Harry
thanks
Colin
said
Harry
who
wasn
the
mood
have
lot
people
staring
avidly
the
scar
his
forehead
got
the
library
got
get
some
work
done
After
that
had
choice
but
turn
right
around
and
head
back
out
the
portrait
hole
again
What
was
the
point
waking
the
Fat
Lady
called
grumpily
after
him
walked
away
Harry
wandered
dispiritedly
toward
the
library
but
halfway
there
changed
his
mind
didn
feel
like
working
turned
around
and
came
face
face
with
Filch
who
had
obviously
just
seen
off
the
last
the
Hogsmeade
visitors
What
are
you
doing
Filch
snarled
suspiciously
Nothing
said
Harry
truthfully
Nothing
spat
Filch
his
jowls
quivering
unpleasantly
likely
story
Sneaking
around
your
own
why
aren
you
Hogsmeade
buying
Stink
Pellets
and
Belch
Powder
and
Whizzing
Worms
like
the
rest
your
nasty
little
friends
Harry
shrugged
Well
get
back
your
common
room
where
you
belong
snapped
Filch
and
stood
glaring
until
Harry
had
passed
out
sight
But
Harry
didn
back
the
common
room
climbed
staircase
thinking
vaguely
visiting
the
Owlery
see
Hedwig
and
was
walking
along
another
corridor
when
voice
from
inside
one
the
rooms
said
Harry
Harry
doubled
back
see
who
had
spoken
and
met
Professor
Lupin
looking
around
his
office
door
What
are
you
doing
said
Lupin
though
very
different
voice
from
Filch
Where
are
Ron
and
Hermione
Hogsmeade
said
Harry
would
casual
voice
said
Lupin
considered
Harry
for
moment
Why
don
you
come
just
taken
delivery
grindylow
for
our
next
lesson
what
said
Harry
followed
Lupin
into
his
office
the
corner
stood
very
large
tank
water
sickly
green
creature
with
sharp
little
horns
had
its
face
pressed
against
the
glass
pulling
faces
and
flexing
its
long
spindly
fingers
Water
demon
said
Lupin
surveying
the
grindylow
thoughtfully
shouldn
have
much
difficulty
with
him
not
after
the
kappas
The
trick
break
his
grip
You
notice
the
abnormally
long
fingers
Strong
but
very
brittle
The
grindylow
bared
its
green
teeth
and
then
buried
itself
tangle
weeds
corner
Cup
tea
Lupin
said
looking
around
for
his
kettle
was
just
thinking
making
one
All
right
said
Harry
awkwardly
Lupin
tapped
the
kettle
with
his
wand
and
blast
steam
issued
suddenly
from
the
spout
Sit
down
said
Lupin
taking
the
lid
off
dusty
tin
only
got
teabags
afraid
but
daresay
you
had
enough
tea
leaves
Harry
looked
him
Lupin
eyes
were
twinkling
How
did
you
know
about
that
Harry
asked
Professor
McGonagall
told
said
Lupin
passing
Harry
chipped
mug
tea
You
not
worried
are
you
said
Harry
thought
for
moment
telling
Lupin
about
the
dog
seen
Magnolia
Crescent
but
decided
not
didn
want
Lupin
think
was
coward
especially
since
Lupin
alreadv
seemed
think
couldn
cope
with
boggart
Something
Harry
thoughts
seemed
have
shown
his
face
because
Lupin
said
Anything
worrying
you
Harry
Harry
lied
drank
bit
tea
and
watched
the
grindylow
brandishing
fist
him
Yes
said
suddenly
putting
his
tea
down
Lupin
desk
You
know
that
day
fought
the
boggart
Yes
said
Lupin
slowly
Why
didn
you
let
fight
said
Harry
abruptly
Lupin
raised
his
eyebrows
would
have
thought
that
was
obvious
Harry
said
sounding
surprised
Harry
who
had
expected
Lupin
deny
that
done
any
such
thing
was
taken
aback
Why
said
again
Well
said
Lupin
frowning
slightly
assumed
that
the
boggart
faced
you
would
assume
the
shape
Lord
Voldemort
Harry
stared
Not
only
was
this
the
last
answer
expected
but
Lupin
had
said
Voldemort
name
The
only
person
Harry
had
ever
heard
say
the
name
aloud
apart
from
himself
was
Professor
Dumbledore
Clearly
was
wrong
said
Lupin
still
frowning
Harry
But
didn
think
good
idea
for
Lord
Voldemort
materialize
the
staffroom
imagined
that
people
would
panic
didn
think
Voldemort
said
Harry
honestly
remembered
those
dementors
see
said
Lupin
thoughtfully
Well
well
impressed
fie
smiled
slightly
the
look
surprise
Harry
face
That
suggests
that
what
you
fear
most
all
fear
Very
wise
Harry
Harry
didn
know
what
say
that
drank
some
mot
tea
you
been
thinking
that
didn
believe
you
capable
fighting
the
boggart
said
Lupin
shrewdly
Well
yeah
said
Harry
was
suddenly
feeling
lot
happier
Professor
Lupin
you
know
the
dementors
was
interrupted
knock
the
door
Come

Lupin
The
door
opened
and
came
Snape

faintly
and
stopped

Harry
his
black
eyes
narrowing

Lupin
smiling

Not

Snape
but
there
was

and

Why
Harry

Lupin

said

Professor
Snape

Professor

goblet
out

hands
Professor
Snape
very
interested

Dark
Arts
blurted
out
Really

Harry
hesitated
then
plunged
recklessly

Hermione

They
hurried
through

and
into
the

Hermione
dropped

glancing
nervously

with
hundreds
and
hundreds
candle
filled
pumpkins
cloud
fluttering
live
bats
and
many
flaming
orange
streamers
which
were
swimming
lazily
across
the
stormy
ceiling
like
brilliant
watersnakes
The
food

Hermione
and
Ron
who
were
full
bursting
with
Honeydukes

Harry
kept

animatedly
tiny
little
Professor
Flitwick
the
Charms
teacher
Harry
moved
his
eyes
along
the
table
the
place
where
Snape
sat
Was
imagining
were
Snape
eyes
flickering
toward
Lupin
more
often
than
was
natural
The
feast
finished
with
entertainment
provided
the
Hogwarts
ghosts
They
popped
out

walls
and
tables

gliding
Nearly
Headless
Nick
the
Gryffindor
ghost
had
great
success
with

Potter
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
followed
the
rest
the
Gryffindors
along
the
usual
path
Gryffindor
Tower
but
when
they
reached
the
corridor
that
ended
with
the
portrait
the
Fat
Lady
they
found
jammed
with
students
Why
isn
anyone
going
said
Ron
curiously
Harry
peered
over
the
heads
front
him
The
portrait
seemed
closed
Let

came
Percy
voice
and
came
bustling
importantly
through
the
crowd
What

holdup
here
You
can
all
have
forgotten
the
password
excuse
Head
Boy
And
then
silence
fell
over
the
crowd
from
the
front
first
that
chill
seemed
spread
down
the
corridor
They
heard
Percy
say
suddenly
sharp
voice
Somebody

Professor
Dumbledore
Quick
People

turned
those
the
back

What

Ginny

later
Professor
Dumbledore
was
there
sweeping
toward
the
portrait
the
Gryffindors
squeezed
together
let
him
through
and
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
moved
closer
see
what
the
trouble
was
Hermione
grabbed
Harry
arm
The
Fat
Lady
had
vanished
from
her
portrait
which
had
been
slashed
viciously
that
strips
canvas
littered
the
floor
great
chunks
had
been
torn
away
completely
Dumbledore
took
one
quick
look
the
ruined
painting
and
turned
his
eyes
somber
see
Professors
McGonagall
Lupin
and
Snape
hurrying
toward
him

Dumbledore

over
the
crowd
and
looking
delighted
always
did
the
sight
wreckage
worry
What

mean
Peeves
said
Dumbledore
calmly
and
Peeves
grin
faded

Dumbledore
quietly

Professorhead

Peeves
with
the

one
cradling
large
bombshell
his

very
angry
when

CHAPTER
NINE
GRIM
DEFEAT
Professor
Dumbledore
sent
all
the
Gryffindors
back
the
Great
Hall
where
they
were
joined
ten
minutes
later
the
students
from
Hufflepuff
Ravenclaw
and
Slytherin
who
all
looked
extremely
confused
The
teachers

need
conduct
thorough
search
the
castle
Professor
Dumbledore
told
them
Professors
McGonagall
and
Flitwick
closed
all
doors
into
the
hall
afraid
that
for
your
own
safety
you
will
have
spend
the
night
here
want
the
prefects
stand
guard
over
the
entrances
the
hall
and
leaving
the
Head
Boy
and
Girl
charge
Any
disturbance
should
reported
immediately
added
Percy
who
was
looking
immensely
proud
and
important
Send
word
with
one
the
ghosts
Professor
Dumbledore
paused
about
leave
the
hall
and
said
yes
you
needing
One
casual
wave
his
wand
and
the
long
tables
flew
the
edges
the
hall
and
stood
themselves
against
the
walls
another
wave
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
hundreds
squashy
purple
sleeping
bags
Sleep
well
said
Professor
Dumbledore
closing
the
door
behind
him
The
hall
immediately
began
buzz
excitedly
the
Gryffindors
were
telling
the
rest
the
school
what
had
just
happened
Everyone
into
their
sleeping
bags
shouted
Percy
Come
now
more
talking
Lights

ten
minutes
mon
Ron
said
Harry
and
Hermione
they
seized
three
sleeping
bags
and
dragged
them
into
corner

think
Black

the
castle
Hermione
whispered
anxiously
Dumbledore

said
Ron
very
lucky
picked
tonight
you

said
Hermione
they
climbed
fully
dressed
into
their
sleeping
bags
and
propped
themselves
their
elbows

The
one
night

the
tower

track
time
being
the
run
said
Ron
Didn
realize
was
Halloween
Otherwise

come
bursting
here
Hermione
shuddered
All
around
them
people
were
asking
one
another
the
same
question
How
did
get
Maybe

how
Apparate
said
Ravenclaw
few
feet
away
Just

Disguised

Hufflepuff
fifth
year

suggested
Dean
Thomas
Honestly
the
only
person
who
ever
bothered
read
Hogwarts
History
said
Hermione
crossly
Harry
and
Ron
Probably
said
Ron
Why
Because

castle
protected
more
than
walls
You

said
Hermione
There
are
all
sorts
enchantments
stop
people
entering
stealth
You

just
Apparate

And
like

the
disguise
that

fool
those
dementors
They
guarding
every
single
entrance
the
grounds
They
have
seen
him
fly
too
And
Fitch
knows
all
the
secret
passages
they
have
them
covered
The
lights
are
going
out
now
Percy
shouted
want
everyone
their
sleeping
bags
and
more
talking
The
candles
all
went
out
once
The
only
light
now
came
from
the
silvery
ghosts
who
were
drifting
about
talking
seriously
the
prefects
and
the
enchanted
ceiling
which
like
the
sky
outside
was
scattered
with
stars
What
with
that
and
the
whispering
that
still
filled
the
hall
Harry
felt
though
were
sleeping
outdoors
light
wind
Once
every
hour
teacher
would
reappear
the
hall
check
that
everything
was
quiet
Around
three
the
morning
when
many
students
had
finally
fallen
asleep
Professor
Dumbledore
came
Harry
watched
him
looking
around
for
Percy
who
had
been
prowling
between
the
sleeping
bags
telling
people
off
for
talking
Percy
was
only
short
way
away
from
Harry
Ron
and
Hermlone
who
quickly
pretended
asleep
Dumbledore
footsteps
drew
nearer
Any
sign
him
Professor
asked
Percy
whisper
All
well
here
Everything
under
control
sir
Good
There
point
moving
them
all
now
found
temporary
guardian
for
the
Gryffindor
portrait
hole
You
able
move
them
back
tomorrow
And
the
Fat
Lady
sir
Hiding
map
Argyllshire
the
second
floor
Apparently
she
refused
let
Black
without
the
password
attacked
She
still
very
distressed
but
once
she
calmed
down
have
Filch
restore
her
Harry
heard
the
door
the
hall
creak
open
again
and
more
footsteps
Headmaster
was
Snape
Harry
kept
quite
still
listening
hard
The
whole
the
third
floor
has
been
searched
not
there
And
Filch
has
done
the
dungeons
nothing
there
either
What
about
the
Astronomy
tower
Professor
Trelawney
room
The
Owlery
All
searched
Very
well
Severus
didn
really
expect
Black
linger
Have
you
any
theory
how
got
Professor
asked
Snape
Harry
raised
his
head
very
slightly
off
his
arms
free
his
other
ear
Many
Severus
each
them
unlikely
the
next
Harry
opened
his
eyes
fraction
and
squinted
where
they
stood
Dumbledore
back
was
him
but
could
see
Percy
face
rapt
with
attention
and
Snape
profile
which
looked
angry
You
remember
the
conversation
had
Headmaster
just
before
the
start
term
said
Snape
who
was
barely
opening
his
lips
though
trying
block
Percy
out
the
conversation
Severus
said
Dumbledore
and
there
was
something
like
warning
his
voice
seems
almost
impossible
that
Black
could
have
entered
the
school
without
inside
help
did
express
concerns
whet
you
appointed
not
believe
single
person
inside
this
castle
would
have
helped
Black
enter
said
Dumbledore
and
his
tone
made
clear
that
the
subject
was
closed
that
Snape
didn
reply
must
down
the
dementors
said
Dumbledore
said
would
inform
them
when
our
search
was
complete
Didn
they
want
help
sit
said
Percy
yes
said
Dumbledore
coldly
But
afraid
dementor
will
cross
the
threshold
this
castle
while
headmaster
Percy
looked
slightly
abashed
Dumbledore
left
the
hall
walking
quickly
and
quietly
Snape
stood
for
moment
watching
the
headmaster
with
expression
deep
resentment
his
face
then
too
left
Harry
glanced
sideways
Ron
and
Hermione
Both
them
had
their
eyes
open
too
reflecting
the
starry
ceiling
What
was
all
that
about
Ron
mouthed
The
school
talked
nothing
but
Sirius
Black
for
the
next
few
days
The
theories
about
how
had
entered
the
castle
became
wilder
and
wilder
Hannah
Abbott
from
Hufflepuff
spent
much
their
next
Herbology
class
telling
anyone
who
listen
that
Black
could
turn
into
flowering
shrub
The
Fat
Lady
ripped
canvas
had
been
taken
off
the
wall
and
Replaced
with
the
portrait
Sir
Cadogan
and
his
fat
gray
pony
Nobody
was
very
happy
about
this
Sir
Cadogan
spent
half
his
time
challenging
people
duels
and
the
rest
thinking
ridiculously
complicated
passwords
which
changed
least
twice
day
complete
lunatic
said
Seamus
Finnigan
angrily
Percy
Can
get
anyone
else
None
the
other
pictures
wanted
the
job
said
Percy
Frightened
what
happened
the
Fat
Lady
Sir
Cadogan
was
the
only
one
brave
enough
volunteer
Sir
Cadogan
however
was
the
least
Harry
worries
was
now
being
closely
watched
Teachers
found
excuses
walk
along
corridors
with
him
and
Percy
Weasley
acting
Harry
suspected
his
mother
orders
was
tailing
him
everywhere
like
extremely
pompous
guard
dog
cap
all
Professor
McGonagall
summoned
Harry
into
her
office
with
such
somber
expression
her
face
Harry
thought
someone
must
have
died
There
point
hiding
from
you
any
longer
Potter
she
said
very
serious
voice
know
this
will
come
shock
you
but
Sirius
Black
know
after
said
Harry
wearily
heard
Ron
dad
telling
his
mum
Weasley
works
for
the
Ministry
Magic
Professor
McGonagall
seemed
very
taken
aback
She
stared
Harry
for
moment
two
then
said
see
Well
that
case
Potter
you
understand
why
don
think
good
idea
for
you
practicing
Quidditch
the
evenings
Out
the
field
with
only
Your
team
members
very
exposed
Potter
got
our
first
match
Saturday
said
Harry
outraged
got
train
Professor
Professor
McGonagall
considered
him
intently
Harry
knew
she
was
deeply
interested
the
Gryffindor
team
prospects
had
been
she
after
all
who
suggested
him
Seeker
the
first
Place
waited
holding
his
breath
Hmm
Professor
McGonagall
stood
and
stared
out
the
window
the
Quidditch
field
just
visible
through
the
rain
Well
goodness
knows
like
see
win
the
Cup
last
but
all
the
same
Potter
happier
teacher
were
present
ask
Madam
Hooch
oversee
your
training
sessions
The
weather
worsened
steadily
the
first
Quidditch
match
drew
nearer
Undaunted
the
Gryffindor
team
was
training
harder
than
ever
under
the
eye
Madam
Hooch
Then
their
final
training
session
before
Saturday
match
Oliver
Wood
gave
his
team
some
unwelcome
news
not
playing
Slytherin
told
them
looking
very
angry
Flint
just
been
see
playing
Hufflepuff
instead
Why
chorused
the
rest
the
team
Flint
excuse
that
their
Seeker
arm
still
injured
said
Wood
grinding
his
teeth
furiously
But
obvious
why
they
doing
Don
want
play
this
weather
Think
damage
their
chances
There
had
been
strong
winds
and
heavy
rain
all
day
and
Wood
spoke
they
heard
distant
rumble
thunder
There
nothing
wrong
with
Malfoy
arm
said
Harry
furiously
faking
know
that
but
can
prove
said
Wood
bitterly
And
been
practicing
all
those
moves
assuming
playing
Slytherin
and
instead
Hufflepuff
and
their
style
quite
different
They
got
new
Captain
and
Seeker
Cedric
Diggory
Angelina
Alicia
and
Katie
suddenly
giggled
What
said
Wood
frowning
this
lighthearted
behavior
that
tall
good
looking
one
isn
said
Angelina
Strong
and
silent
said
Katie
and
they
started
giggle
again
only
silent
because
too
thick
string
two
words
together
said
Fred
impatiently
don
know
why
you
worried
Oliver
Hufflepuff
pushover
Last
time
played
them
Harry
caught
the
Snitch
about
five
minutes
remember
were
playing
completely
different
conditions
Wood
shouted
his
eyes
bulging
slightly
Diggory
put
very
strong
side
together
excellent
Seeker
was
afraid
you
take
like
this
mustn
relax
must
keep
our
focus
Slytherin
trying
wrong
foot
must
win
Oliver
calm
down
said
Fred
looking
slightly
alarmed
taking
Hufflepuff
very
seriously
Seriously
The
day
before
the
match
the
winds
reached
howling
point
and
the
rain
fell
harder
than
ever
was
dark
inside
the
corridors
and
classrooms
that
extra
torches
and
lanterns
were
lit
The
Slytherin
team
was
looking
very
smug
indeed
and
none
more
than
Malfoy
only
arm
was
feeling
bit
better
sighed
the
gale
outside
pounded
the
windows
Harry
had
room
his
head
worry
about
anything
except
the
match
tomorrow
Oliver
Wood
kept
hurrying
him
between
classes
and
giving
him
tips
The
third
time
this
happened
Wood
talked
for
long
that
Harry
suddenly
realized
was
ten
minutes
late
for
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
and
set
off
run
with
Wood
shouting
after
him
Diggory
got
very
fast
swerve
Harry
you
might
want
try
looping
him
Harry
skidded
halt
outside
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
classroom
pulled
the
door
open
and
dashed
inside
Sorry
late
Professor
Lupin
But
wasn
Professor
Lupin
who
looked
him
from
the
teacher
desk
was
Snape
This
lesson
began
ten
minutes
ago
Potter
think
make
ten
points
from
Gryffindor
Sit
down
But
Harry
didn
move
Where
Professor
Lupin
said
says
feeling
too
ill

today
said
Snape
with
twisted
smile
believe
told
you
sit
down
But
Harry
stayed
where
was
What
wrong
with
him
Snape
black
eyes
glittered
Nothing
life
threatening
said
looking
though
wished
were
Five
more
points
from
Gryffindor
and
have
ask
you
sit
down
again
will
fifty
Harry
walked
slowly
his
seat
and
sat
down
Snape
looked
around
the
class
was
saying
before
Potter
interrupted
Professor
Lupin
has
not
left
any
record
the
topics
you
have
covered
far
Please
sir
done
boggarts
Red
Caps
kappas
and
grindylows
said
Hermione
quickly
and
just
about
start
quiet
said
Snape
coldly
did
not
ask
for
information
was
merely
commenting
Professor
Lupin
lack
organization
the
best
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
ever
had
said
Dean
Thomas
boldly
and
there
was
murmur
agreement
from
the
rest
the
class
Snape
looked
more
menacing
than
ever
You
are
easily
satisfied
Lupin
hardly
overtaxing
you
Would
expect
first
years
able
deal
with
Red
Caps
and
grindylows
Today
shall
discuss
Harry
watched
him
flick
through
the
textbook
the
very
back
chapter
which
must
know
they
hadn
covered
Werewolves
said
Snape
But
sir
said
Hermione
seemingly
unable
restrain
herself
not
supposed
werewolves
yet
due
start
hinkypunks
Miss
Granger
said
Snape
voice
deadly
calm
was
under
the
impression
that
teaching
this
lesson
not
you
And
telling
you
all
turn
page
394
glanced
around
again
All
you
Now
With
many
bitter
sidelong
looks
and
some
sullen
muttering
the
class
opened
their
books
Which
you
can
tell
how
distinguish
between
the
werewolf
and
the
true
wolf
said
Snape
Everyone
sat
motionless
silence
everyone
except
Hermione
whose
hand
often
did
had
shot
straight
into
the
air
Anyone
Snape
said
ignoring
Hermione
His
twisted
smile
was
back
Are
you
telling
that
Professor
Lupin
hasn
even
taught
you
the
basic
distinction
between
told
you
said
Parvati
suddenly
haven
got
far
werewolves
yet
still
Silence
snarled
Snape
Well
well
well
never
thought
meet
third
year
class
who
wouldn
even
recognize
werewolf
when
they
saw
one
shall
make
point
informing
Professor
Dumbledore
how
very
behind
you
all
are
Please
sir
said
Hermione
whose
hand
was
still
the
air
the
werewolf
differs
from
the
true
wolf
several
small
ways
The
snout
the
werewolf
That
the
second
time
you
have
spoken
out
turn
Miss
Granger
said
Snape
coolly
Five
more
points
from
Gryffindor
for
being
insufferable
know
all
Hermione
went
very
red
put
down
her
hand
and
stared
the
floor
with
her
eyes
full
tears
was
mark
how
much
the
class
loathed
Snape
that
they
were
all
glaring
him
because
every
one
them
had
called
Hermione
know
all
least
once
and
Ron
who
told
Hermione
she
was
know
all
least
twice
week
said
loudly
You
asked
question
and
she
knows
the
answer
Why
ask
you
don
want
told
The
class
knew
instantly
gone
too
far
Snape
advanced
Ron
slowly
and
the
room
held
its
breath
Detention
Weasley
Snape
said
silkily
his
face
very
close
Ron
And
ever
hear
you
criticize
the
way
teach
class
again
you
will
very
sorry
indeed
one
made
sound
throughout
the
rest
the
lesson
They
sat
and
made
notes
werewolves
from
the
textbook
while
Snape
prowled
and
down
the
rows
desks
examining
the
work
they
had
been
doing
with
Professor
Lupin
Very
poorly
explained
That
incorrect
the
kappa
more
commonly
found
Mongolia
Professor
Lupin
gave
this
eight
out
ten
wouldn
have
given
three
When
the
bell
rang
last
Snape
held
them
back
You

ways

and
kill
werewolves

rolls
parchment

subject
and

Monday
morning
time
somebody
took
this
class
hand
Weasley
stay
behind
need
arrange
your
detention
Harry
and
Hermione
left
the
room
with
the
rest
the
class
who
waited
until
they
were
well
out
earshot
then
burst
into
furious
tirade
about
Snape
Snape
never
been
like
this
with
any
our
other
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teachers
even
did
want
the
job
Harry
said
Hermione
Why
got
for
Lupin
you
think
this
all
because
the
boggart
don
know
said
Hermione
pensively
But
really
hope
Professor
Lupin
gets
better
soon
Ron
caught
with
them
five
minutes
later
towering
rage
you
know
what
that
called
Snape
something
that
made
Hermione
say
Ron
making
got
scrub
out
the
bedpans
the
hospital
wing
Without
magic
was
breathing
deeply
his
fists
clenched
Why
couldn
Black
have
hidden
Snape
office
could
have
finished
him
off
for
Harry
woke
extremely
early
the
next
morning
early
that
was
till
dark
For
moment
thought
the
roaring
the
wind
had
woken
him
Then
felt
cold
breeze
the
back
his
neck
and
sat
bolt
upright
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
had
been
floating
next
him
blowing
hard
his
ear
What
did
you
that
for
said
Harry
furiously
Peeves
puffed
out
his
cheeks
blew
hard
and
zoomed
backward
out
the
room
cackling
Harry
fumbled
for
his
alarm
clock
and
looked
was
half
past
four
Cursing
Peeves
rolled
over
and
tried
get
back
sleep
but
was
very
difficult
now
that
was
awake
ignore
the
sounds
the
thunder
rumbling
overhead
the
pounding
the
wind
against
the
castle
walls
and
the
distant
creaking
the
trees
the
Forbidden
Forest
few
hours
would
out
the
Quidditch
field
battling
through
that
gale
Finally
gave
any
thought
more
sleep
got
dressed
picked
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
and
walked
quietly
out
the
dormitory
Harry
opened
the
door
something
brushed
against
his
leg
bent
down
just
time
grab
Crookshanks
the
end
his
bushy
tail
and
drag
him
outside
You
know
reckon
Ron
was
right
about
you
Harry
told
Crookshanks
suspiciously
There
are
plenty
mice
around
this
place
and
chase
them
added
nudging
Crookshanks
down
the
spiral
staircase
with
his
foot
Leave
Scabbers
alone
The
noise
the
storm
was
even
louder
the
common
roorn
Harry
knew
better
than
think
the
match
would
canceled
Quidditch
matches
weren
called
off
for
trifles
like
thunderstorms
Nevertheless
was
starting
feel
very
apprehensive
Wood
had
pointed
out
Cedric
Diggory
him
the
corridor
Diggory
was
fifth
year
and
lot
bigger
than
Harry
Seekers
were
usually
light
and
speedy
but
Diggory
weight
would
advantage
this
weather
because
was
less
likely
blown
off
course
Harry
whiled
away
the
hours
until
dawn
front
the
fire
getting
every
now
and
then
stop
Crookshanks
from
sneaking
the
boys
staircase
again
long
last
Harry
thought
must
time
for
breakfast
headed
through
the
portrait
hole
alone
Stand
and
fight
you
mangy
cur
yelled
Sir
Cadogan
shut
Harry
yawned
revived
bit
over
large
bowl
porridge
and
the
time
started
toast
the
rest
the
team
had
turned
going
tough
one
said
Wood
who
wasn
eating
anything
Stop
worrying
Oliver
said
Alicia
soothingly
don
mind
bit
rain
But
was
considerably
more
than
bit
rain
Such
was
the
popularity
Quidditch
that
the
whole
school
turned
out
watch
the
match
usual
but
they
ran
down
the
lawns
toward
the
Quidditch
field
heads
bowed
against
the
ferocious
wind
umbrellas
being
whipped
out
their
hands
they
went
just
before
entered
the
locker
room
Harry
saw
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
laughing
and
pointing
him
from
under
enormous
umbrella
their
way
the
stadium
The
team
changed
into
their
scarlet
robes
and
waited
for
Wood
usual
pre
match
pep
talk
but
didn
come
tried
speak
several
times
made
odd
gulping
noise
then
shook
his
head
hopelessly
and
beckoned
them
follow
him
The
wind
was
strong
that
they
staggered
sideways
they
walked
out
onto
the
field
the
crowd
was
cheering
they
couldn
hear
over
the
fresh
rolls
thunder
Rain
was
splattering
over
Harry
glasses
How
earth
was
going
see
the
Snitch
this
The
Hufflepuffs
were
approaching
from
the
opposite
side
the
field
wearing
canary
yellow
robes
The
Captains
walked
eacb
other
and
shook
hands
Diggory
smiled
Wood
but
Wood
looked
though
had
lockjaw
and
merely
nodded
Harry
saw
Madam
Hooch
mouth
form
the
words
Mount
Your
brooms
pulled
his
right
foot
out
the
mud
with
squelch
and
swung
over
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
Madam
Hooch
put
her
whistle
her
lips
and
gave
blast
that
sounded
shrill
and
distant
they
were
off
Harry
rose
fast
but
his
Nimbus
was
swerving
slightly
with
the
wind
held
steady
could
and
turned
squinting
into
the
rain
Within
five
minutes
Harry
was
soaked
his
skin
and
frozen
hardly
able
see
his
teammates
let
alone
the
tiny
Snitch
flew
backward
and
forward
across
the
field
past
blurred
red
and
yellow
shapes
with
idea
what
was
happening
the
rest
the
game
couldn
hear
the
commentary
over
the
wind
The
crowd
was
hidden
beneath
sea
cloaks
and
battered
umbrellas
Twice
Harry
came
very
close
being
unseated
Bludger
his
vision
was
clouded
the
rain
his
glasses
hadn
seen
them
coming
lost
track
time
was
getting
harder
and
harder
hold
his
broom
straight
The
sky
was
getting
darker
though
night
had
decided
come
early
Twice
Harry
nearly
hit
another
player
without
knowing
whether
was
teammate
opponent
everyone
was
now
wet
and
the
rain
thick
could
hardly
tell
them
apart
With
the
first
flash
lightning
came
the
sound
Madam
Hooch
whistle
Harry
could
just
see
the
outline
Wood
through
the
thick
rain
gesturing
him
the
ground
The
whole
team
splashed
down
into
the
mud
called
for
time
out
Wood
roared
his
team
Come
under
here
They
huddled
the
edge
the
field
under
large
umbrella
Harry
took
off
his
glasses
and
wiped
them
hurriedly
his
robes
What
the
score
fifty
points
said
Wood
but
unless
get
the
Snitch
soon
playing
into
the
night
got
chance
with
these
Harry
said
exasperatedly
waving
his
glasses
that
very
moment
Hermione
appeared
his
shoulder
she
was
holding
her
cloak
over
her
head
and
was
inexplicably
beaming
had
idea
Harry
Give
your
glasses
quick
handed
them
her
and
the
team
watched
amazement
Hermione
tapped
them
with
her
wand
and
said
Impervius
There
she
said
handing
them
back
Harry
They
repel
water
Wood
looked
though
could
have
kissed
her
Brilliant
called
hoarsely
after
her
she
disappeared
into
the
crowd
Okay
team
let
for
Hermione
spell
had
done
the
trick
Harry
was
still
numb
with
cold
still
wetter
than
ever
been
his
life
but
could
see
Full
fresh
determination
urged
his
broom
through
the
turbulent
air
staring
every
direction
for
the
Snitch
avoiding
Bludger
ducking
beneath
Diggory
who
was
streaking
the
opposite
direction
There
was
another
clap
thunder
followed
immediately
forked
lightning
This
was
getting
more
and
more
dangerous
Harry
needed
get
the
Snitch
quickly
turned
intending
head
back
toward
the
middle
the
field
but
that
moment
another
flash
lightning
illuminated
the
stands
and
Harry
saw
something
that
distracted
him
completely
the
silhouette
enormous
shaggy
black
dog
clearly
imprinted
against
the
sky
motionless
the
topmost
empty
row
seats
Harry
numb
hands
slipped
the
broom
handle
and
his
Nimbus
dropped
few
feet
Shaking
his
sodden
bangs
out
his
eyes
squinted
back
into
the
stands
The
dog
had
vanished
Harry
came
Wood
anguished
yell
from
the
Gryffindor
goal
posts
Harry
behind
you
Harry
looked
wildly
around
Cedric
Diggory
was
pelting
the
field
and
tiny
speck
gold
was
shimmering
the
rain
filled
air
between
them
With
jolt
panic
Harry
threw
himself
flat
the
broornhandle
and
zoomed
toward
the
Snitch
Come
growled
his
Nimbus
the
rain
whipped
his
face
Taster
But
something
odd
was
happening
eerie
silence
was
falling
across
the
stadium
The
wind
though
strong
ever
was
forgetting
roar
was
though
someone
had
turned
off
the
sound
though
Harry
had
gone
suddenly
deaf
what
was
going
And
then
horribly
familiar
wave
cold
swept
over
him
inside
him
just
became
aware
something
moving
the
field
below
Before
had
time
think
Harry
had
taken
his
eyes
off
the
Snitch
and
looked
down
least
hundred
dementors
their
hidden
faces
pointing
him
were
standing
beneath
him
was
though
freezing
water
were
rising
his
chest
cutting
his
insides
And
then
heard
again
Someone
was
screaming
screaming
inside
his
head
woman
Not
Harry
not
Harry
please
not
Harry
Stand
aside
you
silly
girl
stand
aside
now
Not
Harry
please
take
kill
instead
Numbing
swirling
white
mist
was
filling
Harry
brain
What
was
doing
Why
was
flying
needed
help
her
She
was
going
die
She
was
going
murdered
was
falling
falling
through
the
icy
mist
Not
Harry
Please
have
mercy
have
mercy
shrill
voice
was
laughing
the
woman
was
screaming
and
Harry
knew
more
Lucky
the
ground
was
soft
thought
was
dead
for
sure
But
didn
even
break
his
glasses
Harry
could
hear
the
voices
whispering
but
they
made
sense
whatsoever
didn
have
clue
where
was
how
got
there
what
been
doing
before
got
there
All
knew
was
that
every
inch
him
was
aching
though
had
been
beaten
That
was
the
scariest
thing
ever
seen
life
Scariest
the
scariest
thing
hooded
black
figures
cold
screaming
Harry
eyes
snapped
open
was
lying
the
hospital
wing
The
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
spattered
with
mud
from
head
foot
was
gathered
around
his
bed
Ron
and
Hermione
were
also
there
looking
though
they
just
climbed
out
swimming
pool
Harry
said
Fred
who
looked
extremely
white
underneath
the
mud
How

feeling
was
though
Harry
memory
was
fast
forward
The
lightning
the
Grim

Snitch
and
the
dementors
What

said
sitting
suddenly
they
all
gasped
You

said
Fred
Must
been
what
fifty
feet
thought
you
died
said
Alicia
who
was
shaking
Hermione
made
small
squeaky
noise
Her
eyes
were
extremely
bloodshot
But
the
match
said
Harry
What
happened
Are

The
horrible
truth
sank
into
Harry
like
stone
didn
lose
Diggory
got
the
Snitch
said
George
Just
after
you
fell
didn
realize
what
had
happened
When
looked
back
and
saw
you
the
ground
tried
call
off
Wanted

But
they
won
fair
and
square

Wood
admits
Where
Wood
said
Harry
suddenly
realizing
wasn
there
Still
the
showers
said
Fred
think
trying
drown
himself
Harry
put
his
face
his
knees
his
hands
gripping
his
hair
Fred
grabbed
his
shoulder
and
shook
roughly
mon
Harry

never
missed
the
Snitch
before
There

one
time

George

Right

George
But

Way
Ravenclaw

But

Hufflepuff
all

either

Harry
lay
there
not
saying
word
They
had
lost
for
the
first
time
ever
had
lost
Quidditch
match
After
ten
minutes
Madam
Pomfrey
came
over
tell
the
team

him
peace

and
see
you
later
Fred
told
him
Don

Harry

the
best
Seeker
ever
had
The
team
trooped
out
trailing
mud
behind
them
Madam
Pomfrey
shut
the
door
behind
them
looking
disapproving
Ron
and
Hermione
moved
nearer
Harry
bed
Dumbledore
was
really
angry
Hermione
said
quaking
voice
never
seen
him
like
that
before
ran
onto
the
field
You
fell
waved
his
wand
and
you
sort
slowed
down
before
you
hit
the
ground
Then
whirled
his
wand
the
dementors
Shot
silver
stuff
them
They
left
the
stadium
right
away
was
furious
they
come
onto
the
grounds
heard
him
Then
magicked
you
onto
stretcher
said
Ron
And
walked
school
with
you
floating
Everyone
thought
you
were
His
voice
faded
but
Harry
hardly
noticed
was
thinking
about
what
the
dementors
had
done
him
about
the
screaming
voice
looked
and
saw
Ron
and
Hermione
lookin
him
anxiously
that
quickly
cast
around
for
something
matter
fact
say
Did
someone
get
Nimbus
Ron
and
Hermione
looked
quickly
each
other
What
said
Harry
looking
from
one
the
other
Well
when
you
fell
off
got
blown
away
said
Hermione
hesitantly
And
And
hit
hit
Harry
hit
the
Whomping
Willow
Harry
insides
lurched
The
Whomping
Willow
was
very
violent
tree
that
stood
alone
the
middle
the
grounds
And
said
dreading
the
answer
Well
you
know
the
Whomping
Willow
said
Ron
doesn
like
being
hit
Professor
Flitwick
brought
back
just
before
you
came
around
said
Hermione
very
small
voice
Slowly
she
reached
down
for
bag
her
feet
turned
upside
down
and
tipped
dozen
bits
splintered
wood
and
twig
onto
the
bed
the
only
remains
Harry
faithful
finally
beaten
broomstick
CHAPTER
TEN
THE
MARAUDER
MAP
Madam
Pomfrey
insisted
keeping
Harry
the
hospital
wing
for
the
rest
the
weekend
didn
argue
complain
but
wouldn
let
her
throw
away
the
shattered
remnants
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
knew
was
being
stupid
knew
that
the
Nimbus
was
beyond
repair
but
Harry
couldn
help
felt
though
lost
one
his
best
friends
had
stream
visitors
all
intent
cheering
him
Hagrid
sent
him
bunch
earwiggy
flowers
that
looked
like
yellow
cabbages
and
Ginny
Weasley
blushing
furiously
turned
with
get
well
card
she
had
made
herself
which
sang
shrilly
unless
Harry
kept
shut
under
his
bowl
fruit
The
Gryffindor
team
visited
again
Sunday
morning
this
time
accompanied
Wood
who
told
Harry
hollow
dead
sort
voice
that
didn
blame
him
the
slightest
Ron
and
Hermione
left
Harry
bedside
only
night
But
nothing
anyone
said
did
could
make
Harry
feel
any
better
because
they
knew
only
half
what
was
troubling
him
hadn
told
anyone
about
the
Grim
not
even
Ron
and
Hermione
because
knew
Ron
would
panic
and
Hermione
would
scoff
The
fact
remained
however
that
had
now
appeared
twice
and
both
appearances
had
been
followed
near
fatal
accidents
the
first
time
had
nearly
been
run
over
the
Knight
Bus
the
second
fallen
fifty
feet
from
his
broomstick
Was
the
Grim
going
haunt
him
until
actually
died
Was
going
spend
the
rest
his
life
looking
over
his
shoulder
for
the
beast
And
then
there
were
the
dementors
Harry
felt
sick
and
humiliated
every
time
thought
them
Everyone
said
the
dementors
were
horrible
but
one
else
collapsed
every
time
they
went
near
one
one
else
heard
echoes
their
head
their
dying
parents
Because
Harry
knew
who
that
screaming
voice
belonged
now
had
heard
her
words
heard
them
over
and
over
again
during
the
night
hours
the
hospital
wing
while
lay
awake
staring
the
strips
moonlight
the
ceiling
When
the
dementors
approached
him
heard
the
last
moments
his
mother
life
her
attempts
protect
him
Harry
from
Lord
Voldemort
and
Voldemort
laughter
before
murdered
her
Harry
dozed
fitfully
sinking
into
dreams
full
clammy
rotted
hands
and
petrified
pleading
jerking
awake
dwell
again
his
mother
voice
was
relief
return
the
noise
and
bustle
the
main
school
Monday
where
was
forced
think
about
other
things
eve
had
endure
Draco
Malfoys
taunting
Malfoy
was
almost
beside
himself
with
glee
Gryffindor
defeat
had
finally
taken
off
his
bandages
and
celebrated
having
the
full
use
both
arms
again
doing
spirited
imitations
Harry
falling
off
his
broom
Malfoy
spent
much
their
next
Potions
class
doing
dementor
imitations
across
the
dungeon
Ron
finally
cracked
and
flung
large
slippery
crocodile
heart
Malfoy
which
hit
him
the
face
and
caused
Snape
take
fifty
points
from
Gryffindor
Snape
teaching
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
again
skiving
off
said
Ron
they
headed
toward
Lupin
classroom
after
lunch
Check
who
there
Hermione
Hermione
peered
around
the
classroom
door
okay
Professor
Lupin
was
back
work
certainly
looked
though
had
been
ill
His
old
robes
were
hanging
more
loosely
him
and
there
were
dark
shadows
beneath
his
eyes
nevertheless
smiled
the
class
they
took
their
seats
and
they
burst
once
into
explosion
complaints
about
Snape
behavior
while
Lupin
had
been
ill
not
fair
was
only
filling
why
should
give
homework
don
know
anything
about
werewolves
two
rolls
parchment
Did
you
tell
Professor
Snape
haven
covered
them
yet
Lupin
asked
frowning
slightly
The
babble
broke
out
again
Yes
but
said
were
really
behind
wouldn
listen
two
rolls
parchment
Professor
Lupin
smiled
the
look
indignation
every
face
Don
worry
speak
Professor
Snape
You
don
have
the
essay
said
Hermione
looking
very
disappointed
already
finished
They
had
very
enjoyable
lesson
Professor
Lupin
had
brought
along
glass
box
containing
hinkypunk
little
one
legged
creature
who
looked
though
were
made
wisps
smoke
rather
frail
and
harmless
looking
Lures
travelers
into
bogs
said
Professor
Lupin
they
took
notes
You
notice
the
lantern
dangling
from
his
hand
Hops
ahead
people
follow
the
light
then
The
hinkypunk
made
horrible
squelching
noise
against
the
glass
When
the
bell
rang
everyone
gathered
their
things
and
headed
for
the
door
Harry
among
them
but
Wait
moment
Harry
Lupin
called
like
word
Harry
doubled
back
and
watched
Professor
Lupin
covering
the
hinkypunk
box
with
cloth
heard
about
the
match
said
Lupin
turning
back
his
desk
and
starting
pile
books
into
his
briefcase
and
sorry
about
your
broomstick
there
any
chance
fixing
said
Harry
The
tree
smashed
bits
Lupin
sighed
They
planted
the
Whomping
Willow
the
same
year
that
arrived
Hogwarts
People
used
play
game
trying
get
near
enough
touch
the
trunk
the
end
boy
called
Davey
Gudgeon
nearly
lost
eye
and
were
forbidden
near
broomstick
would
have
chance
Did
you
hear
about
the
dementors
too
said
Harry
with
difficulty
Lupin
looked
him
quickly
Yes
did
don
think
any
have
seen
Professor
Dumbledore
that
angry
They
have
been
growing
restless
for
some
time
furious
his
refusal
let
them
inside
the
grounds
suppose
they
were
the
reason
you
fell
Yes
said
Harry
hesitated
and
then
the
question
had
ask
burst
from
him
before
could
stop
himself
Why
Why
they
affect
like
that
just
has
nothing
with
weakness
said
Professor
Lupin
sharply
though
had
read
Harry
mind
The
dementors
affect
you
worse
than
the
others
because
there
are
horrors
your
past
that
the
others
don
have
ray
wintery
sunlight
fell
across
the
classroom
illuminating
Lupin
gray
hairs
and
the
lines
his
young
face
Dementors
are
among
the
foulest
creatures
that
walk
this
earth
They
infest
the
darkest
filthiest
places
they
glory
decay
and
despair
they
drain
peace
hope
and
happiness
out
the
air
around
them
Even
Muggles
feel
their
presence
though
they
can
see
them
Get
too
near
dementor
and
every
good
feeling
every
happy
memory
will
sucked
out
you
can
the
dementor
will
feed
you
long
enough
reduce
you
something
like
itself
soul
less
and
evil
You
left
with
nothing
but
the
worst
experiences
your
life
And
the
worst
that
happened
you
Harry
enough
make
anyone
fall
off
their
broom
You
have
nothing
feel
ashamed
When
they
get
near
Harry
stared
Lupin
desk
his
throat
tight
can
hear
Voldemort
murdering
mum
Lupin
made
sudden
motion
with
his
arm
though
grip
Harry
shoulder
but
thought
better
There
was
moment
Silence
then
Why
did
they
have
come
the
match
said
Harry
bitterly
They
getting
hungry
said
Lupin
coolly
shutting
his
briefcase
with
snap
Dumbledore
won
let
them
into
the
school
their
supply
human
prey
has
dried
don
think
they
could
resist
the
large
crowd
around
the
Quidditch
field
All
that
excitement
emotions
running
high
was
their
idea
feast
Azkaban
must
terrible
Harry
muttered
Lupin
nodded
grimly
The
fortress
set
tiny
island
way
out
sea
but
they
don
need
walls
and
water
keep
the
prisoners
not
when
they
all
trapped
inside
their
own
heads
incapable
single
cheery
thought
Most
them
mad
within
weeks
But
Sirius
Black
escaped
from
them
Harry
said
slowly
got
away
Lupin
briefcase
slipped
from
the
desk
had
stoop
quickly
catch
Yes
said
straightening
Black
must
have
found
way
fight
them
wouldn
have
believed
possible
Dementors
are
supposed
drain
wizard
his
powers
left
with
them
too
long
You
made
that
dementor
the
train
back
off
said
Harry
suddenly
There
are
certain
defenses
one
can
use
said
Lupin
But
there
was
only
one
dementor
the
train
The
more
there
are
the
more
difficult
becomes
resist
What
defenses
said
Harry
once
Can
you
teach
don
pretend
expert
fighting
dementors
Harry
quite
the
contrary
But
the
dementors
come
another
Quidditch
match
need
able
fight
them
Lupin
looked
into
Harry
determined
face
hesitated
then
said
Well
all
right
try
and
help
But
have
wait
until
next
term
afraid
have
lot
before
the
holidays
chose
very
inconvenient
time
fall
ill
What
with
the
promise
anti
dementor
lessons
from
Lupin
the
thought
that
might
never
have
hear
his
mother
death
again
and
the
fact
that
Ravenclaw
flattened
Hufflepuff
their
Quidditch
match
the
end
November
Harry
mood
took
definite
upturn
Gryffindor
were
not
out
the
running
after
all
although
they
could
not
afford
lose
another
match
Wood
became
repossessed
his
manic
energy
and
worked
his
team
hard
ever
the
chilly
haze
rain
that
persisted
into
December
Harry
saw
hint
dementor
within
the
grounds
Dumbledore
anger
seemed
keeping
them
their
stations
the
entrances
Two
weeks
before
the
end
the
term
the
sky
lightened
suddenly
dazzling
opaline
white
and
the
muddy
grounds
were
revealed
one
morning
covered
glittering
frost
Inside
the
castle
there
was
buzz
Christmas
the
air
Professor
Flitwick
the
Charms
teacher
had
already
decorated
his
classroom
with
shimmering
lights
that
turned
out
real
fluttering
fairies
The
students
were
all
happily
discussing
their
plans
for
the
holidays
Both
Ron
and
Hermione
had
decided
remain
Hogwarts
and
though
Ron
said
was
because
couldn
stand
two
weeks
with
Percy
and
Hermione
insisted
she
needed
use
the
library
Harry
wasn
fooled
they
were
doing
keep
him
company
and
was
very
grateful
everyone
delight
except
Harry
there
was
another
Hogsmeade
trip
the
very
last
weekend
the
term
can
all
our
Christmas
shopping
there
said
Hermione
Mum
and
Dad
would
really
love
those
Toothflossing
Stringmints
from
Honeydukes
Resigned
the
fact
that
would
the
only
third
year
staying
behind
again
Harry
borrowed
copy
Which
Broomstick
from
Wood
and
decided
spend
the
day
reading
the
different
makes
had
been
riding
one
the
school
brooms
team
practice
ancient
Shooting
Star
which
was
very
slow
and
jerky
definitely
needed
new
broom
his
own
the
Saturday
morning
the
Hogsmeade
trip
Harry
bid
good
bye
Ron
and
Hermione
who
were
wrapped
cloaks
and
scarves
then
turned
the
marble
staircase
alone
and
headed
back
toward
Gryffindor
Tower
Snow
had
started
fall
outside
the
windows
and
the
castle
was
very
still
and
quiet
Psst
Harry
turned
halfway
along
the
third
floor
corridor
see
Fred
and
George
peering
out
him
from
behind
statue
humpbacked
one
eyed
witch
What
are
you
doing
said
Harry
curiously
How
come
you
not
going
Hogsmeade
come
give
you
bit
festive
cheer
before
said
Fred
with
mysterious
wink
Come
here
nodded
toward
empty
classroom
the
left
the
one
eyed
statue
Harry
followed
Fred
and
George
inside
George
closed
the
door
quietly
and
then
turned
beaming
look
Harry
Early
Christmas
present
for
you
Harry
said
Fred
pulled
something
from
inside
his
cloak
with
flourish
and
laid
one
the
desks
was
large
square
very
worn
piece
parchment
with
nothing
written
Harry
suspecting
one
Fred
and
George
jokes
stared
What
that
supposed
This
Harry
the
secret
our
success
said
George
patting
the
parchment
fondly
wrench
giving
you
said
Fred
but
decided
last
night
your
need
greater
than
ours
Anyway
know
heart
said
George
bequeath
you
don
really
need
anymore
And
what
need
with
bit
old
parchment
said
Harry
bit
old
parchment
said
Fred
closing
his
eyes
with
grimace
though
Harry
had
mortally
offended
him
Explain
George
Well
when
were
our
first
year
Harry
young
carefree
and
innocent
Harry
snorted
doubted
whether
Fred
and
George
had
ever
been
innocent
Well
more
innocent
than
are
now
got
into
spot
bother
with
Filch
let
off
Dungbomb
the
corridor
and
upset
him
for
some
reason
hauled
off
his
office
and
started
threatening
with
the
usual
detention
disembowelment
and
couldn
help
noticing
drawer
one
his
filing
cabinets
marked
Confiscated
and
Highly
Dangerous
Don
tell
said
Harry
starting
grin
Well
what
would
you
done
said
Fred
George
caused
diversion
dropping
another
Dungbomb
whipped
the
drawer
open
and
grabbed
this
not
bad
sounds
you
know
said
George
don
reckon
Filch
ever
found
out
how
work
probably
suspected
what
was
though
wouldn
have
confiscated
And
you
know
how
work
yes
said
Fred
smirking
This
little
beauty
taught
more
than
all
the
teachers
this
school
You
winding
said
Harry
looking
the
ragged
old
bit
parchment
are
said
George
took
out
his
wand
touched
the
parchment
lightly
and
said
solemnly
swear
that
good
And
once
thin
ink
lines
began
spread
like
spider
web
from
the
point
that
George
wand
had
touched
They
joined
each
other
they
crisscrossed
they
fanned
into
every
corner
the
parchment
then
words
began
blossom
across
the
top
great
curly
green
words
that
proclaimed
Messrs
Moony
Wormtail
Padfoot
and
Prongs
Purveyors
Aids
Magical
Mischief
Makers
are
proud
present
THE
MARAUDER
MAP
was
map
showing
every
detail
the
Hogwarts
castle
and
grounds
But
the
truly
remarkable
thing
were
the
tiny
ink
dots
moving
around
each
labeled
with
name
minuscule
writing
Astounded
Harry
bent
over
labeled
dot
the
top
left
corner
showed
that
Professor
Dumbledore
was
pacing
his
study
the
caretaker
cat
Mrs
Norris
was
prowling
the
second
floor
and
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
was
currently
bouncing
around
the
trophy
room
And
Harry
eyes
traveled
and
down
the
familiar
corridors
noticed
something
else
This
map
showed
set
passages
had
never
entered
And
many
them
seemed
lead
Right
into
Hogsmeade
said
Fred
tracing
one
them
with
his
finger
There
are
seven
all
Now
Filch
knows
about
these
four
pointed
them
out
but
sure
the
only
ones
who
know
about
these
Don
bother
with
the
one
behind
the
mirror
the
fourth
floor
used
until
last
winter
but
caved
completely
blocked
And
don
reckon
anyone
ever
used
this
one
because
the
Whomping
Willow
planted
right
over
the
entrance
But
this
one
here
this
one
leads
right
into
the
cellar
Honeydukes
used
loads
times
And
you
might
noticed
the
entrance
right
outside
this
room
through
that
one
eyed
old
crone
hump
Moony
Wormtaill
Padfoot
and
Prongs
sighed
George
patting
the
heading
the
map
owe
them
much
Noble
men
working
tirelessly
help
new
generation
lawbreakers
said
Fred
solemnly
Right
said
George
briskly
Don
forget
wipe
after
you
used
anyone
can
read
Fred
said
warningly
Just
tap
again
and
say
Mischief
managed
And
blank
young
Harry
said
Fred
uncanny
impersonation
Percy
mind
you
behave
yourself
See
you
Honeydukes
said
George
winking
They
left
the
room
both
smirking
satisfied
sort
way
Harry
stood
there
gazing
the
miraculous
map
watched
the
tiny
ink
Mrs
Norris
turn
left
and
pause
sniff
something
the
floor
Filch
really
didn
know
wouldn
have
pass
the
dementors
all
But
even
stood
there
flooded
with
excitement
something
Harry
had
once
heard
Weasley
say
came
floating
out
his
memory
Never
trust
anything
that
can
think
for
itself
you
can
see
where
keeps
its
brain
This
map
was
one
those
dangerous
magical
objects
Weasley
had
been
warning
against
Aids
for
Magical
Mischief
Makers
but
then
Harry
reasoned
only
wanted
use
get
into
Hogsmeade
wasn
though
wanted
steal
anything
attack
anyone
and
Fred
and
George
had
been
using
for
years
without
anything
horrible
happening
Harry
traced
the
secret
passage
Honeydukes
with
his
finger
Then
quite
suddenly
though
following
orders
rolled
the
map
stuffed
inside
his
robes
and
hurried
the
door
the
classroom
opened
couple
inches
There
was
one
outside
Very
carefully
edged
out
the
room
and
behind
the
statue
the
one
eyed
witch
What
did
have
pulled
out
the
map
again
and
saw
his
astonishment
that
new
ink
figure
had
appeared
upon
labeled
Harry
Potter
This
figure
was
standing
exactly
where
the
real
Harry
was
standing
about
halfway
down
the
third
floor
corridor
Harry
watched
carefully
His
little
Ink
self
appeared
tapping
the
witch
with
his
minute
wand
Harry
quickly
took
out
his
real
wand
and
tapped
the
statue
Nothing
happened
looked
back
the
map
The
tiniest
speech
bubble
had
appeared
next
his
figure
The
word
inside
said
Dissendium
Dissendium
Harry
whispered
tapping
the
stone
witch
again
once
the
statue
hump
opened
wide
enough
admit
fairly
thin
person
Harry
glanced
quickly
and
down
the
corridor
then
tucked
the
map
away
again
hoisted
himself
into
the
hole
headfirst
and
pushed
himself
forward
slid
considerable
way
down
what
felt
like
stone
slide
then
landed
cold
damp
earth
stood
looking
around
was
pitch
dark
held
his
wand
muttered
Lumos
and
saw
that
was
very
narrow
low
earthy
passageway
raised
the
map
tapped
with
the
tip
his
wand
and
muttered
Mischief
managed
The
map
went
blank
once
folded
carefully
tucked
inside
his
robes
then
heart
beating
fast
both
excited
and
apprehensive
set
off
The
passage
twisted
and
turned
more
like
the
burrow
giant
rabbit
than
anything
else
Harry
hurried
along
stumbling
now
and
then
the
uneven
floor
holding
his
wand
out
front
him
took
ages
but
Harry
had
the
thought
Honeydukes
sustain
him
After
what
felt
like
hour
the
passage
began
rise
Panting
Harry
sped
his
face
hot
his
feet
very
cold
Ten
minutes
later
came
the
foot
some
worn
stone
steps
which
rose
out
sight
above
him
Careful
not
make
any
noise
Harry
began
climb
hundred
steps
two
hundred
steps
lost
count
climbed
watching
his
feet
Then
without
warning
his
head
hit
something
hard
seemed
trapdoor
Harry
stood
there
massaging
the
top
his
head
listening
couldn
hear
any
sounds
above
him
Very
slowly
pushed
the
trapdoor
open
and
peered
over
the
edge
was
cellar
which
was
full
wooden
crates
and
boxes
Harry
climbed
out
the
trapdoor
and
replaced
blended
perfectly
with
the
dusty
floor
that
was
impossible
tell
was
there
Harry
crept
slowly
toward
the
wooden
staircase
that
led
upstairs
Now
could
definitely
hear
voices
not
mention
the
tinkle
bell
and
the
opening
and
shutting
door
Wondering
what
ought
suddenly
heard
door
open
much
closer
hand
somebody
was
about
come
downstairs
And
get
another
box
Jelly
Slugs
dear
they
nearly
cleaned
out
said
woman
voice
pair
feet
was
coming
down
the
staircase
Harry
leapt
behind
enormous
crate
and
waited
for
the
footsteps
pass
heard
the
man
shifting
boxes
against
the
opposite
wall
might
not
get
another
chance
Quickly
and
silently
Harry
dodged
out
from
his
hiding
place
and
climbed
the
stairs
looking
back
saw
enormous
backside
and
shiny
bald
head
buried
box
Harry
reached
the
door
the
top
the
stairs
slipped
through
and
found
himself
behind
the
counter
Honeydukes
ducked
crept
sideways
and
then
straightened
Honeydukes
was
crowded
with
Hogwarts
students
that
one
looked
twice
Harry
edged
among
them
looking
around
and
suppressed
laugh
imagined
the
look
that
would
spread
over
Dudley
piggy
face
could
see
where
Harry
was
now
There
were
shelves
upon
shelves
the
most
succulent
looking
sweets
imaginable
Creamy
chunks
nougat
shimmering
pink
squares
coconut
ice
fat
honey
colored
toffees

there
was

Every

another
wall
were
Special
Effects
sweets
Droobles
Best
Blowing
Gum
which
filled
room
with
bluebell
colored
bubbles
that
refused

Toothflossing
Stringmints

Pepper

Ice

hop
realistically
the
stomach
fragile
sugar

and

Harry
squeezed
himself
through
crowd
sixth
years
and
saw
sign
hanging
the
farthest
corner
the
shop
UNUSUAL
TASTES
Ron
and
Hermione
were
standing
underneath
examining
tray
blood
flavored
lollipops
Harry
sneaked
behind
them
Ugh

won
want

vampires

Hermione
was
saying
How

these
said
Ron
shoving
jar
Cockroach
Clusters

Hermione
nose

Harry
Ron
nearly
dropped
the
jar
Harry
squealed
Hermione

Wow
said
Ron
looking
very
impressed

Harry
dropped
his
voice
that
none
the
sixth
years
could
hear
him
and
told
them
all
about
the
Marauder
Map
How

Fred
and
George

Ron
outraged
their

Hermione

Harry
quickly
There

them
And

Harry
hesistated

significantly
and

thick
swirling
snow

Hermione
bit
her
lip
looking
extremely
worried
Are

Harry
asked
her
grinning

not
but
honestly
Harry
Seen
the
Fizzing
Whizbees
Harry
said
Ron
grabbing
him
and
leading
him
over
their
barrel
And

Fred
gave
one
those

Ron

broodingly
into

Acid
Pop
box
Reckon
Fred

Cockroach
Cluster
told
him
they
were
peanuts
When
Ron
and
Hermione
had
paid
for
all
their
sweets
the
three
them
left
Honeydukes
for
the
blizzard
outside
Hogsmeade
looked
like
Christmas
card
the
little
thatched
cottages
and
shops
were
all
covered
layer
crisp
snow
there
were
holly
wreaths
the
doors
and
strings
enchanted
candles
hanging
the
trees
Harry
shivered
unlike
the
other
two
didn
have
his
cloak
They
headed
the
street
heads
bowed
against
the
wind
Ron
and
Hermione
shouting
through
their
scarves
That

the
Three
Broomsticks
Harry
was
more
than
willing
the
wind
was
fierce
and
his
hands
were
freezing
they
crossed
the
road
and
few
minutes
were
entering
the
tiny
inn
was
extremely
crowded
noisy
warm
and
smoky
curvy
sort
woman
with
pretty
face
was

going
slightly
red
Harry
and
Hermione
made
their
way
the
back
the
room
her
there
was
small
vacant
table
between
the
window
and
handsome
Christmas
tree
which
stood
next
the
fireplace
Ron
came
back
five
minutes
later
carrying
three
foaming
tankards
hot
butterbeer
Merry
Christmas
said
happily
raising
his
tankard
Harry
drank
deeply
was
the
most
delicious
thing
ever
tasted
and
seemed
heat
every
bit
him
from
the
inside
sudden
breeze
ruffled
his
hair
The
door
the
Three
Broomsticks
had
opened
again
Harry
looked
over
the
rim
his
tankard
and
choked
Professors
McGonagall
and
Flitwick
had
just
entered
the
pub
with
flurry
snowflakes
shortly
followed
Hagrid

Cornelius

instant
Ron
and
Hermione
had
both
placed
hands
the
top
Harry
head
and
forced
him
off
his
stool
and
under
the
table
Dripping
with
butterbeer
and
crouching
out
sight
Harry
clutched
his
empty
tankard
and
watched
the
teachers
and
Fudge
feet
move
toward
the
bar
pause
then
turn
and
walk
right
toward
him
Somewhere
above
him
Hermione
whispered
Mobiliarbus
The
Christmas
tree
beside
their
table
rose
few
inches
off
the
ground
drifted
sideways
and
landed
with
soft
thump
right
front
their
table
hiding
them
from
view
Staring
through
the
dense
lower
branches
Harry
saw
four
sets
chair
legs
move
back
from
the
table
right
beside
theirs
then
heard
the
grunts
and
sighs
the
teachers
and
minister
they
sat
down
Next
saw
another
pair
feet
wearing
sparkly
turquoise
high
heels
and
heard
woman

Minister
Harry
watched
the
glittering
heels
march
away
and
back
again
His
heart
was
pounding
uncomfortably
his
throat
Why
hadn
occurred
him
that
this
was
the
last
weekend
term
for
the
teachers
And

long
were

Then
said
quiet
voice
What

but
Sirius
Black
daresay
you
heard
what
happened
the
school
Halloween
did
hear
rumor
admitted
Madam
Rosmerta
Did
you
tell
the
whole
pub
Hagrid
said
Professor
McGonagall
exasperatedly
you
think
Blacks
still
the
area
Minister
whispered
Madam
Rosmerta
sure
said
Fudge
shortly
You
know
that
the
dementors
have
searched
the
whole
village
twjce
said
Madam
Rosmerta
slight
edge
her
voice
Scared
all
customers
away
very
bad
for
business
Minister
Rosmerta
dear
don
like
them
any
more
than
you
said
Fudge
uncomfortably
Necessary
precaution
unfortunate
but
there
YOU
are
just
met
some
them
They
fury
against
Dumbledore
won
let
them
inside
the
castle
grounds
should
think
not
said
Professor
McGonagall
sharply
How
are
supposed
teach
with
those
horrors
floating
around
Hear
hear
squeaked
tiny
Professor
Flitwick
whose
feet
were
dangling
foot
from
the
ground
All
the
same
demurred
Fudge
they
are
here
protect
you
all
from
something
much
worse
all
know
what
Black
capable
you
know
still
have
trouble
believing
said
Madam
Rosmerta
thoughtfully
all
the
people
over
the
Dark
Side
Sirius
Black
was
the
last
have
thought
mean
remember
him
when
was
boy
Hogwarts
you
told
then
what
was
going
become
have
said
you
had
too
much
mead
You
don
know
the
half
Rosmerta
said
Fudge
gruffly
The
worst
did
isn
widely
known
The
worst
said
Madam
Rosmerta
her
voice
alive
with
curiosity
Worse
than
murdering
all
those
poor
people
you
mean
certainly
said
Fudge
believe
that
What
could
possibly
worse
You
say
you
remember
him
Hogwarts
Rosmerta
mur
mured
Professor
McGonagall
you
remember
who
his
best
friend
was
Naturally
said
Madam
Rosmerta
with
small
laugh
Never
saw
one
without
the
other
did
you
The
number
times
had
them
here
ooh
they
used
make
laugh
Quite
the
double
act
Sirius
Black
and
James
Potter
Harry
dropped
his
tankard
with
loud
clunk
Ron
kicked
him
Precisely
said
Professor
McGonagall
Black
and
Potter
Ringleaders
their
little
gang
Both
very
bright
course
exceptionally
bright
fact
but
don
think
ever
had
such
pair
troublemakers
dunno
chuckled
Hagrid
Fred
and
George
Weasley
could
give
run
fer
their
money
You
have
thought
Black
and
Potter
were
brothers
chimed
Professor
Flitwick
Inseparable
course
they
were
said
Fudge
Potter
trusted
Black
beyond
all
his
other
friends
Nothing
changed
when
they
left
school
Black
was
best
man
when
James
married
Lily
Then
they
named
him
godfather
Harry
Harry
has
idea
course
You
can
imagine
how
the
idea
would
torment
him
Because
Black
turned
out
league
with
You
Know
Who
whispered
Madam
Rosmerta
Worse
even
than
that
dear
Fudge
dropped
his
voice
and
proceeded
sort
low
rumble
Not
many
people
are
aware
that
the
Potters
knew
You
Know
Who
was
after
them
Dumbledore
who
was
course
working
tirelessly
against
You
Know
Who
had
number
useful
spies
One
them
tipped
him
off
and
alerted
James
and
Lily
once
advised
them
into
hiding
Well
course
You
Know
Who
wasn
easy
person
hide
from
Dumbledore
told
them
that
their
best
chance
was
the
Fidelius
Charm
How
does
that
work
said
Madam
Rosmerta
breathless
with
interest
Professor
Flitwick
cleared
his
throat
immensely
complex
spell
said
squeakily
involving
the
magical
concealment
secret
inside
single
living
soul
The
information
hidden
inside
the
chosen
person
Secret
Keeper
and
henceforth
impossible
find
unless
course
the
Secret
Keeper
chooses
divulge
long
the
Secret
Keeper
refused
speak
You
Know
Who
could
search
the
village
where
Lily
and
James
were
staying
for
years
and
never
find
them
not
even
had
his
nose
pressed
against
their
sitting
room
window
Black
was
the
Potters
Secret
Keeper
whispered
Madam
Rosmerta
Naturally
said
Professor
McGonagall
James
Potter
told
Dumbledore
that
Black
would
die
rather
than
tell
where
they
were
that
Black
was
planning
into
hiding
himself
and
yet
Dumbledore
remained
worried
remember
him
offering
the
Potters
Secret
Keeper
himself
suspected
Black
gasped
Madam
Rosmerta
was
sure
that
somebody
close
the
Potters
had
been
keeping
You
Know
Who
informed
their
movements
said
Professor
McGonagall
darkly
Indeed
had
suspected
for
some
time
that
someone
our
side
had
turned
traitor
and
was
passing
lot
information
You
Know
Who
But
James
Potter
insisted
using
Black
did
said
Fudge
heavily
And
then
barely
week
after
the
Fidelius
Charm
had
been
performed
Black
betrayed
them
breathed
Madam
Rosmerta
did
indeed
Black
was
tired
his
double
agent
role
was
ready
declare
his
support
openly
for
You
Know
Who
and
seems
have
planned
this
for
the
moment
the
Potters
death
But
all
know
You
Know
Who
met
his
downfall
little
Harry
Potter
Powers
gone
horribly
weakened
fled
And
this
left
Black
very
nasty
position
indeed
His
master
had
fallen
the
very
moment
when
Black
had
shown
his
true
colors
traitor
had
choice
but
run
for
Filthy
stinkin
turncoat
Hagrid
said
loudly
that
half
the
bar
went
quiet
Shh
said
Professor
McGonagall
met
him
growled
Hagrid

long
silence
followed
Hagrid
story
Then
Madam
Rosmerta
said
with
some
satisfaction
But
didn
manage
disappear
did
The
Ministry
Magic
caught
with
him
next
day
Alas
only
had
said
Fudge
bitterly
was
not
who
found
him
was
little
Peter
Pettigrew
another
the
Potters
friends
Maddened
grief
doubt
and
knowing
that
Black
had
been
the
Potters
Secret
Keeper
went
after
Black
himself
Pettigrew
that
fat
little
boy
who
was
always
tagging
around
after

Hogwarts
said
Madam
Rosmerta
Hero
worshipped
Black
and
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
Never
quite
their
league

wise
was
often
rather
harp
with
him
You
can
imagine
how
how
regret
that
now
She
sounded
though
she
had
sudden
head
cold
There
now
Minerva
said
Fudge
kindly
Pettigrew
died

death
Eyewitnesses
Muggles
course
wiped
their
memories
later
told
how
Pettigrew
cornered
Black
They
say
was
sobbing
Lily
and
James
Sirius
How
could
you
And
then
went
for
his
wand
Well
course
Black
was
quicker
Blew
Pettigrew
smithereens
Professor
McGonagall
blew
her
nose
and
said
thickly
Stupid
boy
foolish
boy
was
always
hopeless
dueling
should
have
left
the
Ministry
tell

Black
before

Pettigrew

messed
around
with
wands
ripped

Hagrid
growled
You
don
know
what
you
talking
about
Hagrid
said
Fudge
sharply
Nobody
but
trained
Hit
Wizards
from
the
Magical
Law
Enforcement
Squad
would
have
stood
chance
against
Black
once
was
cornered
was
Junior
Minister
the
Department
Magical
Catastrophes
the
time
and
was
one
the
first
the
scene
after
Black
murdered
all
those
people
will
never
forget
still
dream
about
sometimes
crater
the
middle
the
street
deep
had
cracked
the
sewer
below
Bodies
everywhere
Muggles
screaming
And
Black
standing
there
laughing
with
what
was
left
Pettigrew
front
him
heap
bloodstained
robes
and
few
few
fragments
Fudge
voice
stopped
abruptly
There
was
the
sound
five
noses
being
blown
Well
there
you
have
Rosmerta
said
Fudge
thickly
Black
was
taken
away
twenty
members
the
Magical
Law
Enforcement
Squad
and
Pettigrew
received
the
Order
Merlin
First
Class
which
think
was
some
comfort
his
poor
mother
Blades
been
Azkaban
ever
since
Madam
Rosmerta
let
out
long
sigh
true
mad
Minister
wish
could
say
that
was
said
Fudge
slowly
certainly
believe
his
master
defeat
unhinged
him
for
while
The
murder
Pettigrew
and
all
those
Muggles
was
the
action
cornered
and
desperate
man
cruel
pointless
Yet
met
Black
last
inspection
Azkaban
You
know
most
the
prisoners
there
sit
muttering
themselves
the
dark
there
sense
them
but
was
shocked
how
normal
Black
seemed
spoke
quite
rationally
was
unnerving
You
have
thought
was
merely
bored
asked
finished
with
newspaper
cool
you
please
said
missed
doing
the
crossword
Yes
was
astounded
how
little
effect
the
dementors
seemed
having
him
and
was
one
the
most
heavily
guarded
the
place
you
know
Dementors
outside
his
door
day
and
night
But
what
you
think
broken
out
said
Madam
Rosmerta
Good
gracious
Minister
isn
trying
rejoin
You
Know
Who
daresay
that
his
eventual
plan
said
Fudge
evasively
But
hope
catch
Black
long
before
that
must
say
You
Know
Who
alone
and
friendless
one
thing
but
give
him
back
his
most
devoted
servant
and
shudder
think
how
quickly
rise
again
There
was
small
chink
glass
wood
Someone
had
set
down
their
glass
You
know
Cornelius
you
dining
with
the
headmaster
better
head
back
the
castle
said
Professor
McGonagall
One
one
the
pairs
feet
front
Harry
took
the
weight
their
owners
once
more
hems
cloaks
swung
into
sight
and
Madam
Rosemerta
glittering
heels
disappeared
behind
the
bar
The
door
the
Three
Broomsticks
opened
again
there
was
another
flurry
snow
and
the
teachers
had
disappeared
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
faces
appeared
under
the
table
They
were
both
staring
him
lost
for
words
CHAPTER
ELEVEN
THE
FIREBOLT
Harry
didn
have
very
clear
idea
how
had
managed
get
back
into
the
Honeydukes
cellar
through
the
tunnel
and
into
the
castle
once
more
All
knew
was
that
the
return
trip
seemed
take
time
all
and
that
hardly
noticed
what
was
doing
because
his
head
was
still
pounding
with
the
conversation
had
just
heard
Why
had
nobody
ever
told
him
Dumbledore
Hagrid
Weasley
Cornelius
Fudge
why
hadn
anyone
ever
mentioned
the
fact
that
Harry
parents
had
died
because
their
best
friend
had
betrayed
them
Ron
and
Herinione
watched
Harry
nervously
all
through
dintier
not
daring
talk
about
what
they
overheard
because
Percy
was
sitting
close
them
When
they
went
upstairs
the
crowded
common
room
was
find
Fred
and
George
had
set
off
half
dozen
Dungbombs
fit
end
term
high
spirits
Harry
who
didn
want
Fred
and
George
asking
him
whether
reached
Hogsmeade
not
sneaked
quietly
the
empty
dormitory
and
headed
straight
for
his
bedside
cabinet
pushed
his
books
aside
and
quickly
found
what
was
looking
for
the
leather
bound
photo
album
Hagrid
had
given
him
two
years
ago
which
was
full
wizard
pictures
his
mother
and
father
sat
down
his
bed
drew
the
hangings
around
him
and
started
turning
the
pages
searching
until
stopped
picture
his
parents
wedding
day
There
was
his
father
waving
him
beaming
the
untidy
black
hair
Harry
had
inherited
standing
all
directions
There
was
his
mother
alight
with
happiness
arm
arm
with
his
dad
And
there
that
must
him
Their
best
man
Harry
had
never
given
him
thought
before
hadn
known
was
the
same
person
would
never
have
guessed
was
Black
this
old
photograph
His
face
wasn
sunken
and
waxy
but
handsome
full
laughter
Had
already
been
working
for
Voldemort
when
this
picture
had
been
taken
Was
already
planning
the
deaths
the
two
people
next
him
Did
realize
was
facing
twelve
years
Azkaban
twelve
years
that
would
make
him
unrecognizable
But
the
dementors
don
affect
him
Harry
thought
staring
into
the
handsome
laughing
face
doesn
have
hear
Min
screaming
they
get
too
close
Harry
slammed
the
album
shut
reached
over
and
stuffed
back
into
his
cabinet
took
off
his
robe
and
glasses
and
got
into
bed
making
sure
the
hangings
were
hiding
him
from
view
The
dormitory
door
opened
Harry
said
Ron
voice
uncertainly
But
Harry
still
pretending
asleep
heard
Ron
leave
again
and
rolled
over
his
back
his
eyes
wide
open
hatred
such
had
never
known
before
was
coursing
through
Harry
like
poison
could
see
Black
laughing
him
through
the
darkness
though
somebody
had
pasted
the
picture
from
the
album
over
his
eyes
watched
though
somebody
was
playing
him
piece
film
Sirius
Black
blasting
Peter
Pettigrew
who
resembled
Neville
Longbottom
into
thousand
pieces
could
hear
though
having
idea
what
Black
voice
might
sound
like
low
excited
mutter
has
happened
Lord
the
Potters
have
made
their
Secret
Keeper
and
then
came
another
voice
laughing
shrilly
the
same
laugh
that
Harry
heard
inside
his
head
whenever
the
dementors
drew
near
Harry
you
you
look
terrible
Harry
hadn
gotten
sleep
until
daybreak
had
awoken
find
the
dormitory
deserted
dressed
and
gone
down
the
spiral
staircase
common
room
that
was
completely
empty
except
for
Ron
who
was
eating
Peppermint
Toad
and
massaging
his
stomach
and
Hermione
who
had
spread
her
homework
over
three
tables
Where
everyone
said
Harry
Gone
the
first
day
the
holidays
remember
said
Ron
watching
Harry
closely
nearly
lunchtime
was
going
come
and
wake
you
minute
Harry
slumped
into
chair
next
the
fire
Snow
was
still
falling
outside
the
windows
Crookshanks
was
spread
out
front
the
fire
like
large
ginger
rug
You
really
don
look
well
you
know
Hermione
said
peering
anxiously
into
his
face
fine
said
Harry
Harry
listen
said
Hermione
exchanging
look
with
Ron
you
must
really
upset
about
what
heard
yesterday
But
the
thing
you
mustn
doing
anything
stupid
Like
what
said
Harry
Like
trying
after
Black
said
Ron
sharply
Harry
could
tell
they
had
rehearsed
this
conversation
while
had
been
asleep
didn
say
anything
You
won
will
you
Harry
said
Hermione
Because
Black
not
worth
dying
for
said
Ron
Harry
looked
them
They
didn
seem
understand
all
you
know
what
see
and
hear
every
time
dementor
gets
too
near
Ron
and
Hermione
shook
their
heads
looking
apprehensive
can
hear
mum
screaming
and
pleading
with
Voldemort
And
you
heard
your
mum
screaming
like
that
just
about
killed
you
wouldn
forget
hurry
And
you
found
out
someone
who
was
supposed
friend
hers
betrayed
her
and
sent
Voldemort
after
her
There
nothing
you
can
said
Hermione
looking
stricken
The
dementors
will
catch
Black
and
back
Azkaban
and
and
serve
him
right
You
heard
what
Fudge
said
Black
isn
affected
Azkaban
like
normal
people
are
not
punishment
for
him
like
for
the
others
what
are
you
saying
said
Ron
looking
very
tense
You
want
kill
Black
something
Don
silly
said
Herinione
panicky
voice
Harry
doesn
want
kill
anyone
you
Harry
Again
Harry
didn
answer
didn
know
what
wanted
All
knew
was
that
the
idea
doing
nothing
while
Black
was
liberty
was
almost
more
than
could
stand
Malfoy
knows
said
abruptly
Remember
what
said
Potions
was
hunt
him
down
myself

revenge
You

said
Ron
furiously
Listen

got
back
after
Black
had
finished
with
him
Dad

the
Order
Merlin

That

the
biggest
bit

Harry

Ron
angrily
obviously
the
Malfoys

working
for
Voldemort

Malfoy

into
about
million
pieces

said
Harry
shortly
There
was
silence
which
Crookshanks
stretched
luxuriously
flexing
his
claws
Ron
pocket
quivered
Look

Ron
obviously
casting
around
for
change
subject
the

nearly
Christmas

Harry
sitting

hastily
Gobstones

Hagrid
said
Harry
firmly
they
got
their
cloaks
from
their
dormitories
and
set
off
through
the
portrait
hole
Stand
and
fight
you
yellow
bellied
mongrels
down
through
the
empty
castle
and
out
through
the
oak
front
doors
They
made
their
way
slowly
down
the
lawn
making
shallow
trench
the
glittering
powdery
snow
their
socks
and
the
hems
their
cloaks
soaked
and
freezing
The
Forbidden
Forest
looked
though
had
been
enchanted
each
tree
smattered
with
silver
and
Hagrid
cabin
looked
like
iced
cake
Ron
knocked
but
there
was
answer
not
out
said
Hermione
who
was
shivering
under
her
cloak
Ron
had
his
ear
the
door
There
weird
noise
said
Listen
that
Fang
Harry
and
Hermione
put
their
ears
the
door
too
From
inside
the
cabin
came
series
low
throbbing
moans
Think
better
and
get
someone
said
Ron
nervously
Hagrid
called
Harry
thumping
the
door
Hagrid
are

there
There
was
sound
heavy
footsteps
then
the
door
creaked
open
Hagrid
stood
there
with
his
eyes
red
and
swollen
tears
splashing
down
the
front
his
leather
vest
YWve
heard
bellowed
and
flung
himself
onto
Harry
neck
Hagrid
being
least
twice
the
size
normal
man
this
was
laughing
matter
Harry
about
collapse
under
Hagrid
weight
was
rescued
Ron
and
Hermione
who
each
seized
Hagrid
under
arm
and
heaved
him
back
into
the
cabin
Hagrid
allowed
himself
steered
into
chair
and
slumped
over
the
table
sobbing
uncontrollably
his
face
glazed
with
tears
that
dripped
down
into
his
tangled
beard
Hagrid
what
said
Hermione
aghast
Harry
spotted
official
looking

lying
open
the
table
What

Hagrid
Hagrid
sobs
redoubled
but

the

But

for

But
Harry

Ron
Harry

Azkaban
fell
silent
gulping
his
tea
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
watched
him
breathlessly
They
had
never
heard
Hagrid
talk
about
his
brief
spell
Azkaban
before
After
pause
Hermione
said
timidly
awful

Hagrid

Hagrid

Hagrid

tea
Then
said
quietly

The
trip
Hagrid
though
far
from
fun
had
nevertheless
had
the
effect
Ron
and
Hermione
had
hoped
Though
Harry
had
means
forgotten
about
Black
couldn
brood
constantly
revenge
wanted
help
Hagrid
win
his
case
against
the
Committee
for
the
Disposal
Dangerous
Creatures
Ron
and
Hermione
went
the
library
the
next
day
and
returned
the
empty
common
room
laden
with
books
that
might
help
prepare
defense
for
Buckbeak
The
three
them
sat
front
the
roaring
fire
slowly
turning
the
pages
dusty
volumes
about
famous
cases
marauding
beasts
speaking
occasionally
when
they
ran
across
something
relevant
Here
something
there
was
case
1722
but
the
hippogriff
was
convicted
ugh
look
what
they
did
that
disgusting
This
might
help
look
manticore
savaged
someone
1296
and
they
let
the
manticore
off
that
was
only
because
everyone
was
too
scared
near
Meanwhile
the
rest
the
castle
the
usual
magnificent
Christmas
decorations
had
been
put
despite
the
fact
that
hardly
any
the
students
remained
enjoy
them
Thick
streamers
holly
and
mistletoe
were
strung
along
the
corridors
mysterious
lights
shone
from
inside
every
suit
armor
and
the
Great
Hall
was
filled
with
its
usual
twelve
Christmas
trees
glittering
with
golden
stars
powerful
and
delicious
smell
cooking
pervaded
the
corridors
and
Christmas
Eve
had
grown
strong
that
even
Scabbers
poked
his
nose
out
the
shelter
Ron
pocket
sniff
hopefully
the
air
Christmas
morning
Harry
was
woken
Ron
throwing
his
pillow
him
Presents
Harry
reached
for
his
glasses
and
put
them
squinting
through
the
semi
darkness
the
foot
his
bed
where
small
heap
parcels
had
appeared
Ron
was
already
ripping
the
paper
off
his
own
presents
Another
sweater
from
Mum
maroon

thin
package

underneath
What

said
Ron
looking
over
freshly
unwrapped
pair
maroon
socks
his
hand
Dunno
Harry
ripped
the
parcel
open
and
gasped
magnificent
gleaming
broomstick
rolled
out
onto
his
bedspread
Ron
dropped
his
socks
and
jumped
off
his
bed
for
closer
look

said
hoarsely
was
Firebolt
identical
the
dream
broom
Harry
had
gone

Alley
Its
handle
glittered
picked
could
feel
vibrating
and
let
hung
midair
unsupported
exactly
the
right
height
for
him
mount
His
eyes
moved
from
the
golden
registration
number
the
top
the
handle
right
down
the
perfectly
smooth
streamlined
birch
twigs
that
made
the
tail
Who

said
Ron
hushed
voice
Look

Harry
Ron
ripped
apart
the
Firebolt
wrappings
Nothing
Blimey

that
much

Well
said
Harry
feeling
stunned
betting
wasn
the
Dursleys
bet

said
Ron
now
walking
around
and
around
the
Firebolt
taking
every
glorious
inch

Invisibility
Cloak
anonymously
That
was
dad

said
Harry
Dumbledore

just
Passing

Galleons

this
That
why
wouldn
say
was
from
him
said
Ron
case
some
git
like
Malfoy
said

favoritism
Hey
Harry
Ron
gave
great
whoop
laughter
Malfoy
Wait
till

sick
pig
This
international
standard
broom
this
can
believe
this
Harry
muttered
running
hand
along
the
Firebolt
while
Ron
sank
onto
Harry
bed
laughing
his
head
off
the
thought
Malfoy
Who
know
said
Ron
controlling
himself
know
who
could
been
Lupin
What
said
Harry
now
starting
laugh
himself
Lupin
Listen

this
much
gold
able
buy
himself
some
new
robes
Yeah
but

you
said
Ron
And
was
away
when
your
Nimbus
got
smashed
and
might
heard
about
and
decided
visit
Diagon
Alley
and
get
this
for
you
What
you
mean
was
away
said
Harry
was
ill
when
was
playing
that
match
Well
wasn
the
hospital
wing
said
Ron
was
there
cleaning
out
the
bedpans
that
detention
from
Snape
remember
Harry
frowned
Ron
can
see
Lupin
affording
something
like
this
What
you
two
laughing
about
Hermione
had
just
come
wearing
her
dressing
gown
and
carrying
Crookshanks
who
was
looking
very
grumpy
with
string
tinsel
tied
around
his
neck
Don
bring
him
here
said
Ron
hurriedly
snatching
Scabbers
from
the
depths
his
bed
and
stowing
him
his
pajama
pocket
But
Hermione
wasn
listening
She
dropped
Crookshanks
onto
Seamus
empty
bed
and
stared
open
mouthed
the
Firebolt
Harry
Who
sent
you
that
idea
said
Harry
There
wasn
card
anything
with
his
great
surprise
Hermione
did
not
appear
either
excited
intrigued
the
news
the
contrary
her
face
fell
and
she
bit
her
lip
What
the
matter
with
you
said
Ron
don
know
said
Hermione
slowly
but
bit
odd
isn
mean
this
supposed
quite
good
broom
isn
Ron
sighed
exasperatedly
the
best
broom
there
Hermione
said
must
been
really
expensive
Probably
cost
more
than
all
the
Slytherins
brooms
put
together
said
Ron
happily
Well
who
send
Harry
something
expensive
that
and
not
even
tell
him
they
sent
said
Hermione
Who
cares
said
Ron
impatiently
Listen
Harry
can
have
Can
don
think
anyone
should
ride
that
broom
just
yet
said
Hermione
shrilly
Harry
and
Ron
looked
her
What
you
think
Harry
going
with
sweep
the
floor
said
Ron
But
before
Hermione
could
answer
Crookshanks
sprang
from
Seamus
bed
right
Ron
chest
GET
HIM
OUT
HERE
Ron
bellowed
Crookshanks
claws
ripped
his
pajamas
and
Scabbers
attempted
wild
escape
over
his
shoulder
Ron
seized
Scabbers
the
tail
and
aimed
misjudged
kick
Crookshanks
that
hit
the
trunk
the
end
Harry
bed
knocking
over
and
causing
Ron
hop
and
down
howling
with
pain
Crookshanks
fur
suddenly
stood
end
shrill
tint
whistling
was
filling
the
room
The
Pocket
Sneakoscope
had
become
dislodged
from
Uncle
Vernon
old
socks
and
was
whirling
and
gleaming
the
floor
forgot
about
that
Harry
said
bending
down
and
picking
the
Sneakoscope
never
wear
those
socks
can
help
The
Sneakoscope
whirled
and
whistled
his
palm
Crookshanks
was
hissing
and
spitting
You
better
take
that
cat
out
here
Hermione
said
Ron
furiously
sitting
Harry
bed
nursing
his
toe
Can
you
shut
that
thing
added
Harry
Hermione
strode
out
the
room
Crookshanks
yellow
eyes
still
fixed
maliciously
Ron
Harry
stuffed
the
Sneakoscope
back
inside
the
socks
and
threw
back
into
his
trunk
All
that
could
heard
now
were
Ron
stifled
moans
pain
and
rage
Scabbers
was
huddled
Ron
hands
had
been
while
since
Harry
had
seen
him
out
Ron
pocket
and
was
unpleasantly
surprised
see
that
Scabbers
once
fat
was
now
very
skinny
patches
fur
seemed
have
fallen
out
too
not
looking
too
good
Harry
said
stress
said
Ron
fine
that
big
stupid
furball
left
him
alone
But
Harry
remembering
what
the
woman
the
Magical
Menagerie
had
said
about
rats
living
only
three
years
couldn
help
feeling
that
unless
Scabbers
had
powers
had
never
revealed
was
reaching
the
end
his
life
And
despite
Ron
frequent
conplaints
that
Scabbers
was
both
boring
and
useless
was
sure
Ron
would
very
miserable
Scabbers
died
Christmas
spirit
was
definitely
thin
the
ground
the
Gryffindor
common
room
that
morning
Hermione
had
shut
Crookshanks
her
dormitory
but
was
furious
with
Ron
for
trying
kick
him
Ron
was
still
fuming
about
Crookshanks
fresh
attempt
eat
Scabbers
Harry
gave
trying
make
them
talk
each
other
and
devoted
himself
examining
the
Firebolt
which
had
brought
down
the
common
room
with
him
For
some
reason
this
seemed
annoy
Hermione
well
she
didn
say
anything
but
she
kept
looking
darkly
the
broom
though
too
had
been
criticizing
her
cat
lunchtime
they
went
down
the
Great
Hall
find
that
the
House
tables
had
been
moved
against
the
walls
again
and
that
single
table
set
for
twelve
stood
the
middle
the
room
Professors
Dumbledore
McGonagall
Snape
Sprout
and
Flitwick
were
there
along
with
Filch
the
caretaker
who
had
taken
off
his
usual
brown
coat
and
was
wearing
very
old
and
rather
moldy
looking
tailcoat
There
were
only
three
other
students
two
extremely
nervous
looking
first
years
and
sullen
faced
Slytherin
fifth
year
Merry
Christmas
said
Dumbledore
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
approached
the
table
there
are
few
seemed
foolish
use
the
House
tables
Sit
down
sit
down
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
down
side
side
the
end
the
table
Crackers
said
Dumbledore
enthusiastically
offering
the
end
large
silver
noisemaker
Snape
who
took
reluctantly
and
tugged
With
bang
like
gunshot
the
cracker
flew
apart
reveal
large
pointed
witchs
hat
topped
with
stuffed
vulture
Harry
remembering
the
boggart
caught
Ron
eye
and
they
both
grinned
Snape
mouth
thinned
and
pushed
the
hat
toward
Dumbledore
who
swapped
for
his
wizard
hat
once
Dig
advised
the

beaming
around
Harry
was
helping
himself
roast
potatoes
the
doors
the
Great
Hall
opened
again
was
Professor
Trelawney
gliding
toward
them
though
wheels
She
had
put
green
sequined
dress

the
occasion
making
her
look
more
than
ever
like
glittering
oversized
dragonfly
Sibyll
this
pleasant
surprise
said
Dumbledore
standing
have
been
crystal
gazing
Headmaster
said
Professor
Trelawney
her
mistiest
most
faraway
voice
and
astonishment
saw
myself
abandoning
solitary
luncheon
and
coming
join
you
Who
refuse
the
promptings
fate
once
hastened
from
tower
and
beg
you
forgive
lateness
Certainly
certainly
said
Dumbledore
his
eyes
twinkling
Let
draw
you
chair
And
did
indeed
draw
chair
midair
with
his
wand
which
revolved
for
few
seconds
before
falling
with
thud
between
Professors
Snape
and
McGonagall
Professor
Trelawney
however
did
not
sit
down
her
enormous
eyes
had
been
roving
around
the
table
and
she
suddenly
uttered
kind
soft
scream
dare
not
Headmaster
join
the
table
shall
thirteen
Nothing
could
more
unlucky
Never
forget
that
when
thirteen
dine
together
the
first
rise
will
the
first
die
risk
Sibyll
said
Professor
McGonagall
inpatiendy
sit
down
the
turkey
getting
stone
cold
Professor
Trelawney
hesitated
then
lowered
herself
into
the
empty
chair
eyes
shut
and
mouth
clenched
tight
though
expecting
thunderbolt
hit
the
table
Professor
McGonagall
poked
large
spoon
into
the
nearest
tureen
Tripe
Sibyll
Professor
Trelawney
ignored
her
Eyes
open
again
she
looked
around
once
more
and
said
But
where
dear
Professor
Lupin
afraid
the
poor
fellow
ill
again
said
Dumbledore
indicating
that
everybody
should
start
serving
themselves
Most
unfortunate
that
should
happen
Christmas
Day
But
surely
you
already
knew
that
Sibyll
said
Professor
McGonagall
her
eyebrows
raised
Professor
Trelawney
gave
Professor
McGonagall
very
cold
look
Certainly
knew
Minerva
she
said
quietly
But
one
does
not
parade
the
fact
that
one
All
Knowing
frequently
act
though
not
possessed
the
Inner
Eye
not
make
others
nervous
That
explains
great
deal
said
Professor
McGonagall
tartly
Professor
Trelawney
voice
suddenly
became
good
deal
less
misty
you
must
know
Minerva
have
seen
that
poor
Professor
Lupin
will
not
with
for
very
long
seems
aware
himself
that
his
time
short
positively
fled
when
offered
crystal
gaze
for
him
Imagine
that
said
Professor
McGonagall
dryly
doubt
said
Dumbledore
cheerful
but
slightly
raised
voice
which
put
end
Professor
McGonagall
and
Professor
Trelawney
conversation
that
Professor
Lupin
any
immediate
danger
Severus
you
made
the
potion
for
him
again
Yes
Headmaster
said
Snape
what
said
Harry
scrambling
his
feet
Why
will
need
checked
for
jinxes
said
Professor
McGonagall
course
expert
but
daresay
Madam
Hooch
and
Professor
Flitwick
will
strip
down
Strip
down
repeated
Ron
though
Professor
McGonagall
was
mad
shouldn
take
more
than
few
weeks
said
Professor
McGonagall
You
will
have
back
are
sure
jinx
free
There
nothing
wrong
with
said
Harry
his
voice
shaking
slightly
Honestly
Professor
You
can
know
that
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
quite
kindly
not
until
you
flown
any
rate
and
afraid
that
out
the
question
until
are
certain
that
has
not
been
tampered
with
shall
keep
you
informed
Professor
McGonagall
turned
her
heel
and
carried
the
Firebolt
out
the
portrait
hole
which
closed
behind
her
Harry
stood
staring
after
her
the
tin
High
Finish
Polish
still
clutched
his
hands
Ron
however
rounded
Hermione
What
did
you
running
McGonagall
for
Hermione
threw
her
book
aside
She
was
still
pink
the
face
but
stood
and
faced
Ron
defiantly
Because
thought
and
Professor
McGonagall
agrees
with
that
that
broom
was
probably

CHAPTER
TWELVE
THE
PATRONUS
Harry
knew
that
Hermione
had
meant
well
but
that
didn
stop
him
from
being
angry
with
her
had
been
the
owner
the
best
broom
the
world
for
few
short
hours
and
now
because
her
interference
didn
know
whether
would
ever
see
again
was
positive
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
Firebolt
now
but
what
sort
state
would
once
had
been
subjected
all
sorts
anti
jinx
tests
Ron
was
furious
with
Hermione
too
far
was
concerned
the
stripping
down
brand
new
Firebolt
was
nothing
less
than
criminal
damage
Hermione
who
remained
convinced
that
she
had
acted
for
the
best
started
avoiding
the
common
room
Harry
and
Ron
supposed
she
had
taken
refuge
the
library
and
didn
try
persuade
her
come
back
All
all
they
were
glad
when
the
rest
the
school
returned
shortly
after
New
Year
and
Gryffindor
Tower
became
crowded
and
noisy
again
Wood
sought
Harry
out
the
night
before
term
started
Had
good
Christmas
said
and
then
without
waiting
for
answer
sat
down
lowered
his
voice
and
said

some
thinking
over

Harry
After

being
checked
for
jinxes
Jinxed
How

Sirius
Black
Harry
said
wearily
supposed
after
McGonagall
reckons
might
have
sent
Waving
aside
the
information
that
famous
murderer
was
after
his
Seeker
Wood
said
But
Black
couldn
have
bought
Firebolt
the
run
The
whole
country
the
lookout
for
him
How
could
just
walk
into
Quality
Quidditch
Supplies
and

said
Harry
but
McGonagall
still
wants
strip

Harry
promised

Gryffindor
win

Firebolt
Classes
started
again
the
next
day
The
last
thing
anyone
felt
like
doing
was
spending
two
hours
the
grounds
raw
January
morning
but
Hagrid
had
provided
bonfire
full
salamanders
for
their
enjoyment
and
they
spent
unusually
good
lesson
collecting
dry
wood
and
leaves
keep
the
fire
blazing
while
the
flame
loving
lizards
scampered
and
down
the
crumbling
white
hot
logs
The
first
Divination
lesson
the
new
term
was
much
less
fun
Professor
Trelawney
was
now
teaching
them
palmistry
and
she
lost
time
informing
Harry
that
had
the
shortest
life
line
she
had
ever
seen
was
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
that
Harry
was
keen
get
after
his
conversation
with
Wood
wanted
get
started
his
anti
dementor
lessons
soon
possible
yes
said
Lupin
when
Harry
reminded
him

Still

Ron
they
walked
down
the
corridor
heading
dinner
What
you
reckon
the
matter
with
him
There
was
loud
and
impatient
tuh
from
behind
them
was
Hermione
who
had
been
sitting

armor
repacking
her
bag
which
was
full

Ron
irritably
Nothing

Hermione
lofty
voice
heaving
her
bag

shoulder
Yes

Ron

Hermione
with

maddening
superiority

Ron
Fine
said
Hermione
haughtily
and
she
marched
off
She
doesn

said
Ron
staring
resentfully
after
Hermione
She
just
trying
get
talk
her
again
eight

dark
and
empty
when
arrived
but
lit
the
lamps
with
his
wand
and
had
waited
only
five
minutes
when
Professor
Lupin
turned
carrying
large
packing
case
which
heaved
onto
Professor
Binn

What

Harry
Another

Okay
said
Harry
trying
sound
though
wasn
apprehensive
all
and
merely
glad
that
Lupin
had
found
such
good
substitute
for
real
dementor
Professor
Lupin
had
taken
out
his
own
wand
and
indicated
that
Harry

The

Harry
had
sudden
vision
himself
crouching
behind

Professor
Lupin
continued
The
Patronus
kind
positive
force
projection
the

upon
hope
happiness
the
desire

but
cannot
feel
despair
real
humans

dementors
can
hurt
But
must
warn
you
Harry
that
the
charm
might
too
advanced
for
you
Many
qualified
wizards
have
difficulty
with
What

said
Harry
curiously
Each
one
unique
the
wizard
who

And
how

conjure
With
incantation
which
will
work
only
you
are
concentrating
with
all
your

single
very
happy

Harry
cast
his
mind
about
for
happy
memory
Certainly
nothing
that
had
happened
him
the
Dursleys
was
going
Finally
settled
the
moment
when
had
first
ridden

Right
said
trying
recall
exactly
possible
the
wonderful
soaring
sensation
his
stomach
The

his
throat
Expecto

Something

Harry
excitedly
Something

Lupin
smiling
Right

Yes
Harry
said
gripping
his
wand
very
tightly
and
moving
into
the
middle
the
deserted
classroom
tried
keep
his
mind
flying
but
something
else
kept
intruding
Any
second
now
might
hear
his
mother
again
but
shouldn
think
that
would
hear
her
again
and
didn
want

Lupin
grasped
the
lid
the
packing
case
and
pulled

slowly
from
the
box
its
hooded
face
turned
toward
Harry
one
glistening
scabbed
hand
gripping
its
cloak
The
lamps
around
the
classroom
flickered
and
went
out
The
dementor
stepped
from
the
box
and
started

silently
toward
Harry
drawing
deep
rattling
breath
wave
piercing
cold
broke
over
him
Expecto

Harry
yelled
Expecto

Expecto
But
the
classroom
and
the
dementor
were
dissolving
Harry
was
failing
again
through
thick
white
fog
and
his

voice
was
louder
than

echoing
inside
his
head
Not

muttered
sitting
and
feeling
cold
sweat
trickling
down
behind
his
glasses
Are

Lupin
Yes
Harry
pulled
himself

Harry

hard
and
decided

Gryffindor
had
won
the
House
Championship
last
year
had
definitely
qualified
very
happy
gripped
his
wand
tightly

Ready

Lupin
gripping

Ready

Harry
trying

his
head
with
happy
thoughts
about
Gryffindor
winning
and
not
dark
thoughts
about
what
was
going

when
the
box
opened
said
Lupin
pulling
off
the
lid
The
room
went
icily
cold
and
dark

more
The
dementor
glided

wiping
them
off
his

this
against
his
better
judgment
Concentrating
hard
All
right
pulled
off
the
lid
the
case
for
the
third
time
and
the
dementor
rose
out
the
room
fell
cold
and
dark
EXPECTO
PATRONUM
Harry
bellowed
EXPECTO
PATRONUM
EXPECTO

The
screaming
inside
Harry
head
had
started
again
except
this
time
sounded
though
were
coming
from
badly
tuned
radio
softer
and
louder
and
softer
again
and
could
still
see
the
dementor
had
halted
and
then
huge
silver
shadow
came
bursting
out
the
end
Harry
wand
hover
between
him
and
the
dementor
and
though
Harry
legs
felt
like
water
was
still
his
feet
though
for
how
much
longer
wasn
sure
Riddikulus
roared
Lupin
springing
forward
There
was
loud
crack
and
Harry
cloudy
Patronus
vanished
along
with
the
dementor
sank
into
chair
feeling
exhausted
just
run
mile
and
felt
his
legs
shaking
Out
the
corner
his
eye
saw
Professor
Lupin
forcing
the
boggart
back
into
the
packing
case
with
his
wand
had
turned
into
silvery
orb
again
Excellent
Lupin
said
striding
over
where
Harry
sat
Excellent
Harry
That
was
definitely
start
Can

Lupin
firmly

said
Harry
took
bite
the
chocolate
and
watched
Lupin
extinguishing
the
lamps
that
had
rekindled
with
the
disappearance
the
dementor
thought
had
just
occurred
him
Professor
Lupin
said

Lupin
turned
very
quickly
What

that
idea
said
sharply
Nothing

Lupin
face
relaxed
Yes

said
shortly
thought
did
You

Harry
getting
late
Harry
left
the
classroom
walking
along
the
corridor
and
around
corner
then
took
detour
behind
suit
armor
and
sank
down
its
plinth
finish
his
chocolate
wishing
hadn
mentioned
Black
Lupin
was
obviously
not
keen
the
subject
Then
Harry
thoughts
wandered
back
his
mother
and
father
felt
drained
and
strangely
empty
even
though
was
full
chocolate
Terrible
though
was
hear
his
parents
last
moments
replayed
inside
his
head
these
were
the
only
times
Harry
had
heard
their
voices
since
was
very
small
child
But
never
able
produce
proper
Patronus
half
wanted
hear
his
parents
again
They
dead
told
himself
sternly
They
dead
and
listening
echoes
them
won
bring
them
back
You
better
get
grip
yourself
you
want
that
Quidditch
Cup

the
last
bit

into
his
mouth
and
headed
back
Gryffindor
Tower
Ravenclaw
played
Slytherin
week
after
the
start
term
Slytherin
won
though
narrowly
According
Wood
this
was
good
news
for
Gryffindor
who
would
take
second
place
they
beat
Ravenclaw
too
therefore
increased
the
number
team
practices
five
leek
This
meant
that
with
Lupin
anti
dementor
classes
which
themselves
were
more
draining
than
six
Quidditch
practices
Harry
had
just
one
night
week
all
his
homework
Even
was
showing
the
strain
nearly
much
Hermione
whose
immense
workload
finally
seemed
getting
her
Every
night
without
fail
Hermione
was
seen
corner
the
common
room
several
tables
spread
with
books
Arithmancy
charts
rune
dictionaries
diagrams
Muggles
lifting
heavy
objects
and
file
upon
file
extensive
notes
she
barely
spoke
anybody
and
snapped
when
she
was
interrupted
How

doing
Ron
muttered
Harry
one
evening
Harry
sat
finishing
nasty
essay
Undetectable
Poisons
for
Snape
Harry
looked
Hermione
was
barely
visible
behind
tottering
pile
books
Doing

Getting

classes
Ron
said

her
talking
Professor
Vector

Arithmancy
witch
this
morning
They

but
Hermione

there
because
she
was

Care
Magical
Creatures
And
Ernie
McMillan

she

Muggle
Studies
class
but
half
them
are
the
same
time
Divination
and
she
never
missed
one
them
either
Harry
didn
have
time
fathom
the
mystery
Hermione
impossible
schedule
the
moment
really
needed
get
with
Snape
essay
Two
seconds
later
however
was
interrupted
again
this
time
Wood
Bad
news
Harry
just
been
see
Professor
McGonagall
about
the
Firebolt
She
got
bit
shirty
with
Told
got
priorities
wrong
Seemed
think
cared
more
about
winning
the
Cup
than
about
you
staying
alive
Just
because
told
her
didn
care
threw
you
off
long
you
caught
the
Snitch
first
Wood
shook
his
head
disbelief
Honestly
the
way
she
was
yelling
you
think
said
something
terrible
then
asked
her
how
much
longer
she
was
going
keep
screwed
his
face
and
imitated
Professor
McGonagall
severe
voice
long
necessary
Wood
reckon
time

ordered
new
broom
Harry
There

form
the
back
Which
Broomstick
you
could
get
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
and
One
like
Malfoy
got
not
buying
anything
Malfoy
thinks
good
said
Harry
flatly
January
faded
imperceptibly
into
February
with
change
the
bitterly
cold
weather
The
match
against
Ravenclaw
was
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
but
Harry
still
hadn
ordered
new
broom
was
now
asking
Professor
McGonagall
for
news
the
Firebolt
after
every
Transfiguration
lesson
Ron
standing
hopefully
his
shoulder
Hermione
rushing
past
with
her
face
averted
Potter
you
can
have
back
yet
Professor
McGonagall
told
him
the
twelfth
time
this
happened
before
even
opened
his
mouth
checked
for
most
the
usual
curses
but
Professor
Flitwick
believes
the
broom
might
carrying
Hurling
Hex
shall
tell
you
once
finished
checking
Now
please
stop
badgering
make
matters
even
worse
Harry
anti
dementor
lessons
were
not
going
nearly
well
had
hoped
Several
sessions
was
able
produce
indistinct
silvery
shadow
every
time
the
boggart
dementor
approached
him
but
his
Patronus
was
too
feeble
drive
the
dementor
away
All
did
was
hover
like
semitransparent
cloud
draining
Harry
energy
fought
keep
there
Harry
felt
angry
with
himself
guilty
about
his
secret
desire
hear
his
parents
voices
again
You
expecting
too
much
yourself
said
Professor
Lupin
sternly
their
fourth
week
practice
For
thirteen
year
old
wizard
even
indistinct
Patronus
huge
achievement
You
aren
passing
out
anymore
are
you
thought
Patronus
would
charge
the
dementors
down
something
said
Harry
dispiritedly
Make
them
disappear
The
true
Patronus
does
that
said
Lupin
But
you
achieved
great
deal
very
short
space
time
the
dementors
put
appearance
your
next
Quidditch
match
You
will
able
keep
them
bay
long
enough
get
back
the
ground
You
said
harder
there
are
loads
them
said
Harry
have
complete
confidence
you
said
Lupin
smiling
Here
you
earned
drink
something
from
the
Three
Broomsticks
You
won
have
tried
before
pulled
two
bottles
out
his
briefcase
Butterbeer
said
Harry
without
thinking
Yeah
like
that
stuff
Lupin
raised
eyebrow
Ron
and
Hermione
brought
some
back
from
Hogsmeade
Harry
lied
quickly
see
said
Lupin
though
still
looked
slightly
suspicious
Well
let
drink
Gryffindor
victory
against
Ravenclaw
Not
that
supposed
take
sides
teacher
added
hastily
They
drank
the
butterbeer
silence
until
Harry
voiced
something
been
wondering
for
while
What
under
dementor
hood
Professor
Lupin
lowered
his
bottle
thoughtfully
Hmmm
well
the
only
people
who
really
know
are
condition
tell
You
see
the
dementor
lowers
its
hood
only
use
its
last
and
worst
weapon
What
that
They
call
the
Dementor
Kiss
said
Lupin
with
slightly
twisted
smile
what
dementors
those
they
wish
destroy
utterly
suppose
there
must
some
kind
mouth
under
there
because
they
clamp
their
jaws
upon
the
mouth
the
victim
and
and
suck
out
his
soul
Harry
accidentally
spat
out
bit
butterbeer
What
they
kill
said
Lupin
Much
worse
than
that
You
can
exist
without
your
soul
you
know
long
your
brain
and
heart
are
still
working
But
you
have
sense
self
anymore
memory
anything
There
chance
all
recovery
You
just
exist
empty
shell
And
your
soul
gone
forever
lost
Lupin
drank
little
more
butterbeer
then
said
the
fate
that
awaits
Sirius
Black
was
the
Daily
Prophet
this
morning
The
Ministry
have
given
the
dementors
permission
perform
they
find
him
Harry
sat
stunned
for
moment
the
idea
someone
having
their
soul
sucked
out
through
their
mouth
But
then
thought
Black
deserves
said
suddenly
You
think
said
Lupin
lightly
you
really
think
anyone
deserves
that
Yes
said
Harry
defiantly
For
for
some
things
would
have
liked
have
told
Lupin
about
the
conversation
overheard
about
Black
the
Three
Broomsticks
about
Black
betraying
his
mother
and
father
but
would
have
involved
revealing
that
gone
Hogsmeade
without
permission
and
knew
Lupin
wouldn
very
impressed
that
finished
his
butterbeer
thanked
Lupin
and
left
the
History
Magic
classroom
Harry
half
wished
that
hadn
asked
what
was
under
dementor
hood
the
answer
had
been
horrible
and
was
lost
unpleasant
thoughts
what
would
feel
like
have
your
soul
sucked
out
you
that
walked
headlong
into
Professor
McGonagall
halfway
the
stairs
watch
where
you
going
Potter
Sorry
Professor
just
been
looking
for
you
the
Gryffindor
common
room
Well
here
done
everything
could
think
and
there
doesn
seem
anything
wrong
with
all
You
got
very
good
friend
somewhere
Potter
Harry
jaw
dropped
She
was
holding
out
his
Firebolt
and
looked
magnificent
ever
can
have
back
Harry
said
weakly
Seriously
Seriously
said
Professor
McGonagall
and
she
was
actually
smiling
daresay
you
need
get
the
feel
before
Saturday
match
won
you
And
Potter
try
and
win
won
you
out
the
running
for
the
eighth
year
row
Professor
Snape
was
kind
enough
remind
only
last
night
Speechless
Harry
carried
the
Firebolt
back
upstairs
toward
Gryffindor
Tower
turned
corner
saw
Ron
dashing
toward
him
grinning
from
ear
ear
She
gave
You
Excellent
Listen

still
have
Tomorrow
Yeah
anything
said
Harry
his
heart
lighter
than
had
been
month
You
know
what
should
make
with
Hermione
She
was
only
trying
help
Yeah
all
right
said
Ron
She
the
common
room
how
working
for
change
They
turned
into
the
corridor
Gryffindor
Tower
and
saw
Neville
Longbottom
pleading
with
Sir
Cadogan
who
seemed
refusing
him
entrance
wrote
them
down
Neville
was
saying
tearfully
But
must
dropped
them
somewhere
likely
tale
roared
Sir
Cadogan
Then
spotting
Harry
and
Ron
Good
even
fine
young
yeomen
Come
clap
this
loon
irons
trying
force
entry
the
chambers
within
shut
said
Ron
and
Harry
drew
level
with
Neville
lost
the
passwords
Neville
told
them
miserably
made
him
tell
what
passwords
was
going
use
this
week
because
keeps
changing
them
and
now
don
know
what
done
with
them
Oddsbodikins
said
Harry
Sir
Cadogan
who
looked
extremely
disappointed
and
reluctantly
swung
forward
let
them
into
the
common
room
There
was
sudden
excited
murmur
every
head
turned
and
the
next
moment
Harry
was
surrounded
people
exclaiming
over
his
Firebolt
Where
you
get
Harry
Will
you
let
have
Have
you
ridden
yet
Harry
Ravenclaw
have
chance
they
all
Cleansweep
Sevens
Can
just
hold
Harry
After
ten
minutes
during
which
the
Firebolt
was
Passed
around
and
admired
from
every
angle
the
crowd
dispersed
and
Harry
and
Ron
had
clear
view
Hermione
the
only
person
who
hadn
rushed
over
them
bent
over
her
work
and
carefully
avoiding
their
eyes
Harry
and
Ron
approached
her
table
and
last
she
looked
got
back
said
Harry
grinning
her
and
holding
the
Firebolt
See
Hermione
There
wasn
anything
wrong
with
said
Ron
Well
there
might
have
been
said
Hermione
mean
least

know
now
that
safe
Yeah

said
Harry
better

Ron
eagerly
got

Scabbers

rat
tonic
took
the
Firebolt
and
holding
were
made
glass
carried
away
the
boys
staircase
Can
sit
down
then
Harry
asked
Hermione
suppose
said
Hermione
moving
great
stack
parchment
off
chair
Harry
looked
around
the
cluttered
table
the
long
Arithmancy
essay
which
the
ink
was
still
glistening
the
even
longer
Muggle
Studies
essay
Explain
Why
Muggles
Need
Electricity
and
the
rune
translation
Hermione
was
now
poring
over
How
are
you
getting
through
all
this
stuff
Harry
asked
her
well
you
know
working
hard
said
Hermione
Close
Harry
saw
that
she
looked
almost
tired
Lupin
Why
don
you
just
drop
couple
subjects
Harry
asked
watching
her
lifting
books
she
searched
for
her
rune
dictionary
couldn
that
said
Hermione
looking
scandalized
Arithmancy
looks
terrible
said
Harry
picking
very
complicated
looking
number
chart
wonderful
said
Hermione
earnestly
favorite
subject
But
exactly
what
was
wonderful
about
Arithmancy
Harry
never
found
out
that
precise
moment
strangled
yell
echoed
down
the
boys
staircase
The
whole
common
room
fell
silent
staring
petrified
the
entrance
Then
came
hurried
footsteps
growing
louder
and
louder
and
then
Ron
came
leaping
into
view
dragging
with
him
bedsheet
LOOK
bellowed
striding
over
Hermione
table
LOOK
yelled
shaking
the
sheets
her
face
Ron
what
SCABBERS
LOOK
SCABBERS
Hermione
was
leaning
away
from
Ron
looking
utterly
bewildered
Harry
looked
down
the
sheet
Ron
was
holding
There
was
something
red
Something
that
looked
horribly
like
BLOOD
Ron
yelled
into
the
stunned
silence
GONE
AND
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
WAS
THE
FLOOR
said
Hermione
trembling
voice
Ron
threw
something
down
onto
Hermione

translation
Hermione
and
Harry
leaned
forward
Lying
top
the
weird
spiky
shapes
were
several
long
ginger
cat
hairs
CHAPTER
THIRTEEN
GRYFFINDOR
VERSUS
RAVENCLAW
looked
like
the
end
Ron
and
Hermione
friendship
Each
was
angry
with
the
other
that
Harry
couldn
see
how
they
ever
make
Ron
was
enraged
that
Hermione
had
never
taken
Crookshanks
attempts
eat
Scabbers
seriously
hadn
bothered
keep
close
enough
watch
him
and
was
still
trying
pretend
that
Crookshanks
was
innocent
suggesting
that
Ron
look
for
Scabbers
under
all
the
boys
beds
Hermione
meanwhile
maintained
fiercely
that
Ron
had
proof
that
Crookshanks
had
eaten
Scabbers
that
the
ginger
hairs
might
have
been
there
since
Christmas
and
that
Ron
had
been
prejudiced
against
her
cat
ever
since
Crookshanks
had
landed
Ron
head
the
Magical
Menagerie
Personally
Harry
was
sure
that
Crookshanks
had
eaten
Scabbers
and
when
tried
point
out
Hermione
that
the
evidence
all
pointed
that
way
she
lost
her
temper
with
Harry
too
Okay
side
with
Ron
knew
you
would
she
said
shrilly
First
the
Firebolt
now
Scabbers
everything
fault
isn
just
leave
alone
Harry
got
lot
work
Ron
had
taken
the
loss
his
rat
very
hard
indeed
Come
Ron
you
were
always
saying
how
boring
Scabbers
was
said
Fred
bracingly
And
been
off
color
for
ages
was
wasting
away
was
probably
better
for
him
snuff
quickly
one
swallow
probably
didn
feel
thing
Fred
said
Ginny
indignantly
All
did
was
eat
and
sleep
Ron
you
said
yourself
said
George
bit
Goyle
for
once
Ron
said
miserably
Remember
Harry
Yeah
that
true
said
Harry
His
finest
hour
said
Fred
unable
keep
straight
face
Let
the
scar
Goyle
finger
stand
lasting
tribute
his
memory
come
Ron
get
yourself
down
Hogsmeade
and
buy
new
rat
what
the
point
moaning
last
ditch
attempt
cheer
Ron
Harry
persuaded
him
come
along
the
Gryffindor
team
final
practice
before
the
Ravenclaw
match
that
could
have
ride
the
Firebolt
after
they
finished
This
did
seem
take
Ron
mind
off
Scabbers
for
moment
Great
Can
try
and
shoot
few
goals
they
set
off
for
the
Quidditch
field
together
Madam
Hooch
who
was
still
overseeing
Gryffindor
practices
keep
eye
Harry
was
just
impressed
with
the
Firebolt
everyone
else
had
been
She
took
her
hands
before
takeoff
and
gave
them
the
benefit
her
professional
opinion
Look
the
balance
the
Nimbus
series
has
fault
slight
list
the
tail
end
you
often
find
they
develop
drag
after
few
years
They
updated
the
handle
too
bit
slimmer
than
the
Cleansweeps
reminds
the
old
Silver
Arrows
Pity
they
stopped
making
them
learned
fly
one
and
very
fine
old
broom
was
too
She
continued
this
vein
for
some
time
until
Wood
said
Madam
Hooch
okay
Harry
has
the
Firebolt
back
need
practice
right
here
you
are
then
Potter
said
Madam
Hooch
sit
over
here
with
Weasley
She
and
Ron
left
the
field
sit
the
stadium
and
the
Gryffindor
team
gathered
around
Wood
for
his
final
instructions
for
tomorrow
match
Harry
just
found
out
who
Ravenclaw
playing
Seeker
Cho
Chang
She
fourth
year
and
she
pretty
good
really
hoped
she
wouldn
fit
she
had
some
problems
with
injuries
Wood
scowled
his
displeasure
that
Cho
Chang
had
made
full
recovery
then
said
the
other
hand
she
rides
Comet
Two
Sixty
which
going
look
like
joke
next
the
Firebolt
gave
Harry
broom
look
fervent
admiration
then
said
Okay
everyone
let
And
long
last
Harry
mounted
his
Firebolt
and
kicked
off
from
the
ground
was
better
than
ever
dreamed
The
Firebolt
turned
with
the
lightest
touch
seemed
obey
his
thoughts
rather
than
his
grip
sped
across
the
field
such
speed
that
the
stadium
turned
into
green
and
gray
blur
Harry
turned
sharply
that
Alicia
Spinnet
screamed
then
went
into
perfectly
controlled
dive
brushing
the
grassy
field
with
his
toes
before
rising
thirty
forty
fifty
feet
into
the
air
again
Harry
letting
the
Snitch
out
Wood
called
Harry
turned
and
raced
Bludger
toward
the
goal
posts
outstripped
easily
saw
the
Snitch
dart
out
from
behind
Wood
and
within
ten
seconds
had
caught
tightly
his
hand
The
team
cheered
madly
Harry
let
the
Snitch
again
gave
minute
head
start
then
tore
after
weaving
and
out
the
others
spotted
lurking
near
Katie
Bell
knee
looped
her
easily
and
caught
again
was
the
best
practice
ever
the
team
inspired
the
presence
the
Firebolt
their
midst
performed
their
best
moves
faultlessly
and
the
time
they
hit
the
ground
again
Wood
didn
have
single
criticism
make
which
George
Weasley
pointed
out
was
first
can
see
what
going
stop
tomorrow
said
Wood
Not
unless
Harry
you
sorted
out
your
dementor
problem
haven
you
Yeah
said
Harry
thinking
his
feeble
Patronus
and
wishing
were
stronger
The
dementors
won
turn
again
Oliver
Dumbledore
ballistic
said
Fred
confidently
Well
let
hope
not
said
Wood
Anyway
good
work
everyone
Let
get
back
the
tower
turn
early
staying
out
for
bit
Ron
wants
the
Firebolt
Harry
told
Wood
and
while
the
rest
the
team
headed
off
the
locker
rooms
Harry
strode
over
Ron
who
vaulted
the
barrier
the
stands
and
came
meet
him
Madam
Hooch
had
fallen
asleep
her
seat
Here
you
said
Harry
handing
Ron
the
Firebolt
Ron
expression
ecstasy
his
face
mounted
the
broom
and
zoomed
off
into
the
gathering
darkness
while
Harry
walked
around
the
edge
the
field
watching
him
Night
had
fallen
before
Madam
Hooch
awoke
with
start
told
Harry
and
Ron
off
for
not
waking
her
and
insisted
that
they
back
the
castle
Harry
shouldered
the
Firebolt
and
and
Ron
walked
out
the
shadowy
stadium
discussing
the
Firebolt
superbly
smooth
action
its
phenomenal
acceleration
and
its
pinpoint
turning
They
were
halfway
toward
the
castle
when
Harry
glancing
his
left
saw
something
that
made
his
heart
turn
over
pair
eyes
gleaming
out
the
darkness
Harry
stopped
dead
his
heart
banging
against
his
ribs
What
the
matter
said
Ron
Harry
pointed
Ron
pulled
out
his
wand
and
muttered
Lumos
beam
light
fell
across
the
grass
hit
the
bottom
tree
and
illuminated
its
branches
there
crouching
among
the
budding
leaves
was
Crookshanks
Get
out
here
Ron
roared
and
stooped
down
and
seized
stone
lying
the
grass
but
before
could
anything
else
Crookshanks
had
vanished
with
one
swish
his
long
ginger
tail
See
Ron
said
furiously
chucking
the
stone
down
again
She
still
letting
him
wander
about
wherever
wants
probably
washing
down
Scabbers
with
couple
birds
now
Harry
didn
say
anything
took
deep
breath
relief
seeped
through
him
had
been
sure
for
moment
that
those
eyes
had
belonged
the
Grim
They
set
off
for
the
castle
once
more
slightly
ashamed
his
moment
panic
Harry
didn
say
anything
Ron
nor
did
look
left
right
until
they
had
reached
the
well
lit
entrance
hall
Harry
went
down
breakfast
the
next
morning
with
the
rest
the
boys
his
dormitory
all
whom
seemed
think
the
Firebolt
deserved
sort
guard
honor
Harry
entered
the
Great
Hall
heads
turned
the
direction
the
Firebolt
and
there
was
good
deal
excited
muttering
Harry
saw
with
enormous
satisfaction
that
the
Slytherin
team
were
all
looking
thunderstruck
Did
you
see
his
face
said
Ron
gleefully
looking
back
Malfay
can
believe
This
brilliant
Wood
too
was
basking
the
reflected
glory
the
Firebolt
Put
here
Harry
said
laying
the
broom
the
middle
the
table
and
carefully
turning
that
its
name
faced
upward
People
from
the
Ravenclaw
and
Hufflepuff
tables
were
soon
coming
over
look
Cedric
Diggory
came
over
congratulate
Harry
having
acquired
such
superb
replacement
for
his
Nimbus
and
Percy
Ravenclaw
girlfriend
Penelope
Clearwater
asked
she
could
actually
hold
the
Firebolt
Now

Penny

said
Percy
heartily
she
examined
the
Firebolt
closely
Penelope
and
have
got

told
the
team
Ten
Galleons

outcome
the
match
Penelope
put
the
Firebolt
down
again
thanked
Harry
and
went
back
her
table
Harry
make
sure

said
Percy
urgent
whisper

ten
Galleons
Yes

Penny
And
bustled
off
join
her
piece
toast
Sure

can
manage
that
broom
Potter
said
cold
drawling
voice
Draco
Malfoy
had
arrived
for
closer
look
Crabbe
and
Coyle
right
behind
him
Yeah

said
Harry
casually

Malfoy

glittering
maliciously
Shame

Crabbe
and
Goyle
sniggered
Pity

can
attach
extra
arm
yours
Malfoy
said
Harry
Then
could
catch
the
Snitch
for
you
The
Gryffindor
team
laughed
loudly
Malfoy
pale
eyes
narrowed
and
stalked
away
They
watched
him
rejoin
the
rest
the
Slytherin
team
who
put
their
heads
together
doubt
asking
Malfoy
whether
Harry
broom
really
was
Firebolt
quarter
eleven
the
Gryffindor
team
set
off
for
the
locker
rooms
The
weather
couldn
have
been
more
different
from
their
match
against
Hufflepuff
was
clear
cool
day
with
very
light
breeze
there
would
visibility
problems
this
time
and
Harry
though
nervous
was
starting
feel
the
excitement
only
Quidditch
match
could
bring
They
could
hear
the
rest
the
school
moving
into
the
stadium
beyond
Harry
took
off
his
black
school
robes
removed
his
wand
from
his
pocket
and
stuck
inside
the
shirt
was
going
wear
under
his
Quidditch
robes
only
hoped
wouldn
need
wondered
suddenly
whether
Professor
Lupin
was
the
crowd
watching
You

said
Wood
they
prepared
leave
the
locker
rooms

this
match
out
the
running
just
just
fly
like
you
did
practice
yesterday
and
okay
They
walked
out
onto
the
field
tumultuous
applause
The
Ravenclaw
team
dressed
blue
were
already
standing
the
middle
the
field
Their
Seeker
Cho
Chang
was
the
only
girl
their
team
She
was
shorter
than
Harry
about
head
and
Harry
couldn
help
noticing
nervous
was
that
she
was
extremely
pretty
She
smiled
Harry
the
teams
faced
each
other
behind
their
captains
and
felt
slight
lurch
the
region
his
stomach
that
didn
think
had
anything
with
nerves
Wood
Davies
shake
hands
Madam
Hooch
said
briskly
and
Wood
shook
hands
with
the
Ravenclaw
Captain
Mount
your
brooms
whistle
three
two
one
Harry
kicked
off
into
the
air
and
the
Firebolt
zoomed
higher
and
faster
than
any
other
broom
soared
around
the
stadium
and
began
squinting
around
for
the
Snitch
listening
all
the
while
the
commentary
which
was
being
provided
the
Weasley
twins
friend
Lee
Jordan
They

Katie
Bell
Gryffindor
heading
for
goal
Harry
streaked
past
Katie
the
opposite
direction
gazing
around
for
glint
gold
and
noticing
that
Cho
Chang
was
tailing
him
closely
She
was
undoubtedly
very
good
flier
she
kept
cutting
across
him
forcing
him
change
direction
Show
her
your
acceleration
Harry
Fred
yelled
whooshed
past
pursuit
Bludger
that
was
aiming
for
Alicia
Harry
urged
the
Firebolt
forward
they
rounded
the
Ravenclaw
goal
posts
and
Cho
fell
behind
Just
Katie
succeeded
scoring
the
first
goal
the
match
and
the
Gryffindor
end
the
field
went
wild
saw
the
Snitch
was
close
the
ground
flitting
near
one
the
barriers
Harry
dived
Cho
saw
what
was
doing
and
tore
after
him
Harry
was
speeding
excitement
flooding
him
dives
were
his
speciality
was
ten
feet
away
Then
Bludger
hit
one
the
Ravenclaw
Beaters
came
pelting
out
nowhere
Harry
veered
off
course
avoiding
inch
and
those
few
crucial
seconds
the
Snitch
had
vanished
There
was
great
Ooooooh
disappointment
from
the
Gryffindor
supporters
but
much
applause
for
their
Beater
from
the
Ravenclaw
end
George
Weasley
vented
his
feelings
hitting
the
second
Bludger
directly
the
offending
Beater
who
was
forced
roll
right
over
midair

Gryffindor
leads
eighty

THE
COMMENTARY
Ravenclaw
was
pulling
back
they
had
now
scored
three
goals
which
put
Gryffindor
only
fifty
points
ahead
Cho
got
the
Snitch
before
him
Ravenclaw
would
win
Harry
dropped
lower
narrowly
avoiding
Ravenclaw
Chaser
scanning
the
field
frantically
glint
gold
flutter
tiny
wings
the
Snitch
was
circling
the
Gryffindor
goal
post
Harry
accelerated
eyes
fixed
the
speck
gold
ahead
but
just
then
Cho
appeared
out
thin
air
blocking
him
HARRY
THIS
TIME
GENTLEMAN
Wood
roared
Harry
swerved

collision
KNOCK
HER
OFF
HER
BROOM

Harry
turned
and
caught
sight
Cho
she
was
grinning
The
Snitch
had
vanished
again
Harry
turned
his
Firebolt
upward
and
was
soon
twenty
feet
above
the
game
Out
the
corner
his
eye
saw
Cho
following
him
She
decided
mark
him
rather
than
search
for
the
Snitch
herself
All
right
then
she
wanted
tail
him
she
have
take
the
consequences
dived
again
and
Cho
thinking
seen
the
Snitch
tried
follow
Harry
pulled
out
the
dive
very
sharply
she
hurtled
downward
rose
fast
bullet
once
more
and
then
saw
for
the
third
time
the
Snitch
was
glittering
way
above
the
field
the
Ravenclaw
end
accelerated
many
feet
below
did
Cho
was
winning
gaining
the
Snitch
with
every
second
then
screamed
Cho
pointing
Distracted
Harry
looked
down
Three
dementors
three
tall
black
hooded
dementors
were
looking
him
didn
stop
think
Plunging
hand
down
the
neck
his
robes
whipped
out
his
wand
and
roared
Expecto
patronum
Something
silver
white
something
enormous
erupted
from
the
end
his
wand
knew
had
shot
directly
the
dementors
but
didn
pause
watch
his
mind
still
miraculously
clear
looked
ahead
was
nearly
there
stretched
out
the
hand
still
grasping
his
wand
and
just
managed
close
his
fingers
over
the
small
struggling
Snitch
Madam
Hooch
whistle
sounded
Harry
turned
around
midair
and
saw
six
scarlet
blurs
bearing
down
him
next
moment
the
whole
team
was
hugging
him
hard
was
nearly
pulled
off
his
broom
Down
below
could
hear
the
roars
the
Gryffindors
the
crowd
That
boy
Wood
kept
yelling
Alicia
Angelina
and
Katie
had
all
kissed
Harry
Fred
had
him
grip
tight
Harry
felt
though
his
head
would
come
off
complete
disarray
the
team
managed
make
its
way
back
the
ground
Harry
got
off
his
broom
and
looked
see
gaggle
Gryffindor
supporters
sprinting
onto
the
field
Ron
the
lead
Before
knew
had
been
engulfed
the
cheering
crowd
Yes
Ron
yelled
yanking
Harry
arm
into
the
air
Yes

Harry
said
Percy
looking
delighted

Harry
roared
Seamus

Ruddy
brilliant
boomed
Hagrid
over
the

the
milling
Gryffindors
That
was
quite
some
Patronus
said
voice
Harry
ear
Harry
turned
around
see
Professor
Lupin
who
looked
both
shaken
and
pleased
The
dementors
didn
affect
all
Harry
said
excitedly
didn
feel
thing
That
would
because
they
weren
dementors
said
Professor
Lupin
Come
and
see
led
Harry
out
the
crowd
until
they
were
able
see
the
edge
the
field
You
gave
Malfoy
quite
fright
said
Lupin
Harry
stared
Lying
crumpled
heap
the
ground
were
Malfoy
Crabbe
Goyle
and
Marcus
Flint
the
Slytherin
team
Captain
all
struggling
remove
themselves
from
long
black
hooded
robes
looked
though
Malfoy
had
been
standing
Goyle
shoulders
Standing
over
them
with
expression
the
utmost
fury
her
face
was
Professor
McGonagall
unworthy
trick
she
was
shouting
low
and
cowardly
attempt
sabotage
the
Gryffindor
Seeker
Detention
for

you
and
fifty
points
from
Slytherin
shall
speaking
Professor
Dumbledore
about
this
make
mistake
here
comes
now
anything
could
have
set
the
seal
Gryffindor
victory
was
this
Ron
who
had
fought
his
way
through
Harry
side
doubled
with
laughter
they
watched
Malfoy
fighting
extricate
himself
from
the
robe
Goyle
head
still
stuck
inside
Come
Harry
said
George
fighting
his
way
over
Party
Gryffindor
common
room
now
Right
said
Harry
and
feeling
happier
than
had
ages
and
the
rest
the
team
led
the
way
still
their
scarlet
robes
out
the
stadium
and
back
the
castle
felt
though
they
had
already
won
the
Quidditch
Cup
the
party
went
all
day
and
well
into
the
night
Fred
and
George
Weasley
disappeared
for
couple
hours
and
returned
with
armfuls
bottles
butterbeer
pumpkin
fizz
and
several
bags
full
Honeydukes
sweets
How
did
you
that
squealed
Angelina
Johnson
George
started
throwing
Peppermint
Toads
into
the
crowd
With
little
help
from
Moony
Wormtail
Padfoot
and
Prongs
Fred
muttered
Harry
ear
Only
one
person
wasn
joining
the
festivities
Hermione
incredibly
was
sitting
corner
attempting
read
enormous
book
entitled
Home
Life
and
Social
Habits
British
Muggles
Harry
broke
away
from
the
table
where
Fred
and
George
had
started
juggling
butterbeer
bottles
and
went
over
her
Did
you
even
come
the
match
asked
her
course
did
said
Hermione
strangely
high
pitched
voice
not
looking
And
very
glad
won
and
think
you
did
really
well
but
need
read
this
Monday
Come
Hermione
come
and
have
some
food
Harry
said
looking
over
Ron
and
wondering
whether
was
good
enough
mood
bury
the
hatchet
can
Harry
still
got
four
hundred
and
twenty
two
pages
read
said
Hermione
now
sounding
slightly
hysterical
Anyway
She
glanced
over
Ron
too
doesn
want
join
There
was
arguing
with
this
Ron
chose
that
moment
say
loudly
Scabbers
hadn
just
been
eaten
could
have
had
some
those
Fudge
Flies
used
really
like
them
Hermione
burst
into
tears
Before
Harry
could
say
anything
she
tucked
the
enormous
book
under
her
arm
and
still
sobbing
ran
toward
the
staircase
the
girls
dormitories
and
out
sight
Can
you
give
her
break
Harry
asked
Ron
quietly
said
Ron
flatly
she
just
acted
like
she
was
sorry
but
she
never
admit
she
wrong
Hermione
She
still
acting
like
Scabbers
has
gone
vacation
something
The
Gryffindor
party
ended
only
when
Professor
McGonagall
turned
her
tartan
dressing
gown
and
hair
net
one
the
morning
insist
that
they
all
bed
Harry
and
Ron
climbed
the
stairs
their
dormitory
still
discussing
the
match
last
exhausted
Harry
climbed
into
bed
twitched
the
hangings
his
four
poster
shut
block
out
ray
moonlight
lay
back
and
felt
himself
almost
instantly
drifting
off
sleep
had
very
strange
dream
was
walking
through
forest
his
Firebolt
over
his
shoulder
following
something
silvery
white
was
winding
its
way
through
the
trees
ahead
and
could
only
catch
glimpses
between
the
leaves
Anxious
catch
with
sped
but
moved
faster
did
his
quarry
Harry
broke
into
run
and
ahead
heard
hooves
gathering
speed
Now
was
running
flat
out
and
ahead
could
hear
galloping
Then
turned
corner
into
clearing
and
AAARRGGHH
NOOO
Harry
woke
suddenly
though
been
hit
the
face
Disoriented
the
total
darkness
fumbled
with
his
hangings
could
hear
movements
around
him
and
Seamus
Finnigan
voice
from
the
other
side
the
room
What
going
Harry
thought
heard
the
dormitory
door
slam
last
finding
the
divide
his
curtains
ripped
them
back
and
the
same
moment
Dean
Thomas
lit
his
lamp
Ron
was
sitting

the
hangings
torn
from
one
side
look
utmost
terror
his
face
Black
Sirius
Black
With
knife
What
Here
Just
now
Slashed
the
curtains
Woke
You
sure
you
weren
dreaming
Ron
said
Dean
Look
the
curtains
tell
you
was
here
They
all
scrambled
out
bed
Harry
reached
the
dormitory
door
first
and
they
sprinted
back
down
the
staircase
Doors
opened
behind
them
and
sleepy
voices
called
after
them
Who
shouted
What
you
doing
The
common
room
was
lit
with
the
glow
the
dying
fire
still
littered
with
the
debris
from
the
party
was
deserted
Are
you
sure
you
weren
dreaming
Ron
telling
you
saw
him
What
all
the
noise
Professor
McGonagall
told
bed
few
the
girls
had
come
down
their
staircase
pulling
dressing
gowns
and
yawning
Boys

were
reappearing
Excellent

said
Fred
Weasley
brightly
Everyone

upstairs
said
Percy
hurrying
into
the
common
room
and
pinning
his
Head

badge
his
pajamas
spoke
Perce
Sirius
Black
said
Ron
faintly
our
dormitory
With
knife
Woke
The
common
room
went
very
still
Nonsense
said
Percy
looking
startled
You
had
too
much
eat
Ron
had
nightmare
telling
you
Now
really
enough
enough
Professor
McGonagall
was
back
She
slammed
the
portrait
behind
her
she
entered
the
common
room
and
stared
furiously
around
delighted
that
Gryffindor
won
the
match
but
this
getting
ridiculous
Percy
expected
better
you
certainly
didn
authorize
this
Professor
said
Percy
puffing
himself
indignantly
was
just
telling
them

Ron
here
had
nightmare
WASN
NIGHTMARE
Ron
yelled
PROFESSOR
WOKE
AND
SIRIUS

STANDING
OVER
HOLDING

Professor
McGonagall
stared
him
Don

gotten
through
the
portrait
hole
Ask

said
Ron
pointing
shaking
finger

back
Sir
Cadogan
picture
Ask
him
saw
Glaring
suspiciously
Ron
Professor
McGonagall
pushed
the
Portrait
back
open
and
went
outside
The
whole
common
room
listened
with
bated
breath
Sir
Cadogan
did
you
just
let
man
enter
Gryffindor
Tower
Certainly
good
lady
cried
Sir
Cadogan
There
was
stunned
silence
both
inside
and
outside
the
common
room
You

said
Professor
McGonagall
But
but
the
password
had
said
Sir
Cadogan
proudly
Had
the
whole
week
lady
Read
off
little
piece
paper
Professor
McGonagall
pulled
herself
back
through
the
portrait
hole
face
the
stunned
crowd
She
was
white
chalk
Which
person
she
said
her
voice
shaking
which
abysmally
foolish
person
wrote
down
this
week
passwords
and
left
them
lying
around
There
was
utter
silence
broken
the
smallest
terrified
squeaks
Neville

CHAPTER
FOURTEEN
SNAPE
GRUDGE
one
Gryffindor
Tower
slept
that
night
They
knew
that
the
castle
was
being
searched
again
and
the
whole
House
stayed
awake
the
common
room
waiting
hear
whether
Black
had
been
caught
Professor
McGonagall
came
back
dawn
tell
them
that
had
again
escaped
Throughout
the
day
everywhere
they
went
they
saw
signs
tighter
security
Professor
Flitwick
could
seen
teaching
the
front
doors
recognize
large
picture
Sirius
Black
Filch
was
suddenly
bustling
and
down
the
corridors
boarding
everything
from
tiny
cracks
the
walls
mouse
holes
Sir
Cadogan
had
been
fired
His
portrait
had
been
taken
back
its
lonely
landing
the
seventh
floor
and
the
Fat
Lady
was
back
She
had
been
expertly
restored
but
was
still
extremely
nervous
and
had
agreed
return
her
job
only
condition
that
she
was
given
extra
protection
bunch
surly
security
trolls
had
been
hired
guard
her
They
paced
the
corridor
menacing
group
talking
grunts
and
comparing
the
size
their
clubs
Harry
couldn
help
noticing
that
the
statue
the
one
eyed
witch
the
third
floor
remained
unguarded
and
unblocked
seemed
that
Fred
and
George
had
been
right
thinking
that
they
and
now
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
the
only
ones
who
knew
about
the
hidden
passageway
within
you
reckon
should
tell
someone
Harry
asked
Ron
know
not
coming
through
Honeyduke
said
Ron
dismissively
heard
the
shop
had
been
broken
into
Harry
was
glad
Ron
took
this
view
the
one
eyed
witch
was
boarded
too
would
never
able
into
Hogsmeade
again
Ron
had
become
instant
celebrity
For
the
first
time
his
life
people
were
paying
more
attention
him
than
Harry
and
was
clear
that
Ron
was
rather
enjoying
the
experience
Though
still
severely
shaken
the
night
events
was
happy
tell
anyone
who
asked
what
had
happened
with
wealth
detail
was
asleep
and
heard
this
ripping
noise
and
thought
was
dream
you
know
But
then
there
was
this
draft
woke
and
one
side
the
hangings
bed
had
been
pulled
down
rolled
over
and
saw
him
standing
over
like
skeleton
with
loads
filthy
hair
holding
this
great
long
knife
must
been
twelve
inches
and
looked
and
looked
him
and
then
yelled
and
scampered
Why
though
Ron
added
Harry
the
group
secondyear
girls
who
had
been
listening
his
chilling
tale
departed
Why
did
run
Harry
had
been
wondering
the
same
thing
Why
had
Black
having
got
the
wrong
bed
not
silenced
Ron
and
proceeded
Harry
Black
had
proved
twelve
years
ago
that
didn
mind
murdering
innocent
people
and
this
time
had
been
facing
five
unarmed
boys
four
whom
were
asleep
must
known
have
job
getting
back
out
the
castle
once
you
yelled
and
woken
people
said
Harry
thoughtfully
had
kill
the
whole
House
get
back
through
the
portrait
hole
then
would
met
the
teachers
Neville
was
total
disgrace
Professor
McGonagall
was
furious
with
him
she
had
banned
him
from
all
future
Hogsmeade
visits
given
him
detention
and
forbidden
anyone
give
him
the
password
into
the
tower
Poor
Neville
was
forced
wait
outside
the
common
room
every
night
for
somebody
let
him
while
the
security
trolls
leered
unpleasantly
him
None
these
punishments
however
came
close
matching
the
one
his
grandmother
had
store
for
him
Two
days
after
Black
break
she
sent
Neville
the
very
worst
thing
Hogwarts
student
could
receive
over
breakfast
Howler
The
school
owls
swooped
into
the
Great
Hall
carrying
the
mail
usual
and
Neville
choked
huge
barn
owl
landed
front
him
scarlet
envelope
clutched
its
beak
Harry
and
Ron
who
were
sitting
opposite
him
recognized
the
letter
Howler
once
Ron
had
got
one
from
his
mother
the
year
before
Run
for
Neville
Ron
advised
Neville
didn
need
telling
twice
seized
the
envelope
and
holding
before
him
like
bomb
sprinted
out
the
hall
while
the
Slytherin
table
exploded
with
laughter
the
sight
him
They
heard
the
Howler
off
the
entrance
hall
Neville
grandmother
voice
magically
magnified
hundred
times
its
Usual
volume
shrieking
about
how
had
brought
shame
the
whole
family
Harry
was
too
busy
feeling
sorry
for
Neville
notice
immediately
that
had
letter
too
Hedwig
got
his
attention
nipping
him
sharply
the
wrist
Ouch
thanks
Hedwig
Harry
tore
open
the
envelope
while
Hedwig
helped
herself
some
Neville
cornflakes
The
note
inside
said

said
Ron
six
clock
that
afternoon
Harry
and
Ron
left
Gryffindor
Tower
passed
the
security
trolls
run
and
headed
down
the
entrance
hall
Hagrid
was
already
waiting
for
them
All

Ron

Hagrid
opening
the
front
doors
and
leading
them
outside
said
Ron
looking
slightly
put
out
The
first
thing
they
saw
entering
Hagrid
cabin
was
Buckbeak
who
was
stretched
out
top
Hagrid
patchwork
quilt
his
enormous
wings
folded
tight
his
body
enjoying
large
plate
dead
ferrets
Averting
his
eyes
from
this
unpleasant
sight
Harry
saw
gigantic
hairy
brown
suit
and
very
horrible
yellow
and
orange
tie
hanging
from
the
top
Hagrid
wardrobe
door
What

nasty
pang
guilt
had
completely
forgotten
that
Buckbeak

was
near

judging
the
uneasy
look
Ron
face
had
too
They
had
also
forgotten
their
promise
about
helping
him
prepare
Buckbeak
defense
the
arrival
the
Firebolt
had
driven
clean
out
their
minds
Hagrid
poured
them
tea
and
offered
them
plate
Bath
buns

than
accept
they

had
too
much
experience

Quidditch
Cup
nine
clock
Hagrid
walked
them
back
the
castle
large
group
people
was
bunched
around
the
bulletin
board
when
they
returned
the
common
room

Ron
craning
over

quietly
Harry

down
Well

Harry
said
even
more
quietly
Harry
said
voice
his
right
ear
Harry
started
and
looked
around
Hermione
who
was
sitting
the
table
right
behind
them
and
clearing
space
the
wall
books
that
had
been
hiding
her
Harry

Hermione

After

Ron
furiously

Hermione
opened
her
mouth
respond
but
with
soft
hiss
Crookshanks
leapt
onto
her
lap
Hermione
took
one
frightened
look
the
expression
Ron
face
gathered
Crookshanks
and
hurried
away
toward
the
girls
dormitories
how
about
Ron
said
Harry
though
there
had
been
interruption
Come

Harry
looked
around
check
that
Hermione

well
out

Okay
said
But
taking
the
Invisibility
Cloak
this
time
Saturday
morning
Harry
packed
his
Invisibility
Cloak
his
bag
slipped
the
Marauder
Map
into
his
pocket
and
went
down
breakfast
with
everyone
else
Hermione
kept
shooting
suspicious
looks
down
the
table
him
but
avoided
her
eye
and
was
careful
let
her
see
him
walking
back
the
marble
staircase
the
entrance
hall
everybody
else
proceeded
the
front
doors
Bye
Harry
called
Ron
See

Ron
grinned
and
winked
Harry
hurried
the
third
floor
slipping
the
Marauder
Map
out
his
pocket
went
Crouching
behind
the
one
eyed
witch
smoothed
out
tiny
dot
was
moving
his
direction
Harry
squinted
The
minuscule
writing
next
read
Neville
Longbottom
Harry
quickly
pulled
out
his
wand
muttered
Dissendium
and
shoved
his
bag
into
the
statue
but
before
could
climb
himself
Neville
came
around
the
corner
Harry
forgot
you
weren
going
Hogsmeade
either
Neville
said
Harry
moving
swiftly
away
from
the
statue
and
pushing
the
map
back
into
his
pocket
What
are
you
Nothing
shrugged
Neville
Want
game
Exploding
Snap
not

vampire
essay

Lupin

said
Neville
brightly

said
Neville
his
round
face
anxious
don
understand
that
thing
about
the
garlic
all
they
have
eat
broke
off
with
small
gasp
looking
over
Harry
shoulder
was
Snape
Neville
took
quick
step
behind
Harry
And
what
are
you
two
doing
here
said
Snape
coming
halt
and
looking
from
one
the
other
odd
place
meet
Harry
immense
disquiet
Snape
black
eyes
flicked
the
doorways
either
side
them
and
then
the
one
eyed
witch
not
meeting
here
said
Harry
just
met
here
Indeed
said
Snape
You
have
habit
turning
unexpected
places
Potter
and
you
are
very
rarely
there
for
good
reason
suggest
the
pair
you
return
Gryffindor
Tower
where
you
belong
Harry
and
Neville
set
off
without
another
word
they
turned
the
corner
Harry
looked
back
Snape
was
running
one
his
hands
over
the
one
eyed
witch
head
examining
closely
Harry
managed
shake
Neville
off
the
Fat
Lady
telling
him
the
password
then
pretending
left
his
vampire
essay
the
library
and
doubling
back
Once
out
sight
the
security
trolls
pulled
out
the
map
again
and
held
close
his
nose
The
third
floor
corridor
seemed
deserted
Harry
scanned
the
map
carefully
and
saw
with
leap
relief
that
the
tiny
dot
labeled
Severus
Snape
was
now
back
its
office
sprinted
back
the
one
eyed
witch
opened
her
hump
heaved
himself
inside
and
slid
down
meet
his
bag
the
bottom
the
stone
chute
wiped
the
Marauder
Map
blank
again
then
set
off
run
Harry
completely
hidden
beneath
the
Invisibility
Cloak
emerged
into
the
sunlight
outside
Honeydukes
and
prodded
Ron
the
back
muttered
What
kept
you
Ron
hissed
Snape
was
hanging
around
They
set
off
the
High
Street
Where
are
you
Ron
kept
muttering
out
the
corner
his
mouth
Are
you
still
there
This
feels
weird
They
went
the
post
office
Ron
pretended
checking
the
price
owl
Bill
Egypt
that
Harry
could
have
good
look
around
The
owls
sat
hooting
softly
down
him
least
three
hundred
them
from
Great
Grays
right
down
tiny
little
Scops
owls
Local
Deliveries
Only
which
were
small
they
could
have
sat
the
palm
Harry
hand
Then
they
visited
Zonko
which
was
packed
with
students
Harry
had
exercise
great
care
not
tread
anyone
and
cause
panic
There
were
jokes
and
tricks
fulfill
even
Fred
and
George
wildest
dreams
Harry
gave
Ron
whispered
orders
and
passed
him
some
gold
from
under
the
cloak
They
left
Zonko
with
their
money
bags
considerably
lighter
than
they
had
been
entering
but
their
pockets
bulging
with
Dungbombs
Hiccup
Sweets
Frog
Spawn
Soap
and
Nose
Biting
Teacup
apiece
The
day
was
fine
and
breezy
and
neither
them
felt
like
staying
indoors
they
walked
past
the
Three
Broomsticks
and
climbed
slope
visit
the
Shrieking
Shack
the
most
haunted
dwelling
Britain
stood
little
way
above
the
rest
the
village
and
even
daylight
was
slightly
creepy
with
its
boarded
windows
and
dank
overgrown
garden
Even
the
Hogwarts
ghosts
avoid
said
Ron
they
leaned
the
fence
looking
asked
Nearly
Headless
Nick
says
heard
very
rough
crowd
lives
here
one
can
get
Fred
and
George
tried
obviously
but
all
the
entrances
are
sealed
shut
Harry
feeling
hot
from
their
climb
was
just
considering
taking
off
the
cloak
for
few
minutes
when
they
heard
voices
nearby
Someone
was
climbing
toward
the
house
from
the
other
side
the
hill
moments
later
Malfoy
had
appeared
followed
closely
Crabbe
and
Goyle
Malfoy
was
speaking
should
have
owl
from
Father
any
time
now
had
the
hearing
tell
them
about
arm
about
how
couldn
use
for
three
months
Crabbe
and
Goyle
sniggered
really
wish
could
hear
that
great
hairy
moron
trying
defend
himself
There
arm
onest
that
hippogriff
good
dead
Malfoy
suddenly
caught
sight
Ron
His
pale
face
split
malevolent
grin
What
are
you
doing
Weasley
Malfoy
looked
the
crumbling
house
behind
Ron
Suppose
You
love
live
here
wouldn
you
Weasley
Dreaming
about
having
your
own
bedroom
heard

family
all

one
room
that
true
Harry
seized
the
back
Ron
robes
stop
him
from
leaping
Malfoy
Leave

hissed
Ron
ear
The
opportunity
was
too
perfect
miss
Harry
crept
silently
around
behind
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
bent
down
and
scooped
large
handful
mud
out
the
path
were
just
discussing
your
friend
Hagrid
Malfoy
said
Ron
Just
trying
imagine
what
saying
the
Committee
for
the
Disposal
Dangerous
Creatures

think
cry
when
they
cut
off
his
hippogriff
SPLAT
Malfoy
head
jerked
forward
the
mud
hit
him
his
silverblond
hair
was
suddenly
dripping
muck
What
the
Ron
had
hold
onto
the
fence
keep
himself
standing
was
laughing
hard
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
spun
stupidly
the
spot
staring
wildly
around
Malfoy
trying
wipe
his
hair
clean
What
was
that
Who
did
that
Very
haunted
here
isn
said
Ron
with
the
air
one
commenting
the
weather
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
looking
scared
Their
bulging
muscles
were
use
against
ghosts
Malfoy
was
staring
madly
around
the
deserted
landscape
Harry
sneaked
along
the
path
where
particularly
sloppy
puddle
yielded
some
foul
smelling
green
sludge
SPLATTER
Crabbe
and
Goyle
caught
some
this
time
Goyle
hopped
furiously
the
spot
trying
rub
out
his
small
dull
eyes
came
from
over
there
said
Malfoy
wiping
his
face
and
staring
spot
some
six
feet
the
left
Harry
Crabbe
blundered
forward
his
long
arms
outstretched
like
zombie
Harry
dodged
around
him
picked
stick
and
lobbed
Crabbe
back
Harry
doubled
with
silent
laughter
Crabbe
did
kind
pirouette
midair
trying
see
who
had
thrown
Ron
was
the
only
person
Crabbe
could
see
was
Ron
started
toward
but
Harry
stuck
out
his
leg
Crabbe
stumbled
and
his
huge
flat
foot
caught
the
hem
Harry
cloak
Harry
felt
great
tug
then
the
cloak
slid
off
his
face
For
split
second
Malfoy
stared
him
AAARGH
yelled
pointing
Harry
head
Then
turned
tail
and
ran
breakneck
speed
back
down
the
hill
Crabbe
and
Goyle
behind
him
Harry
tugged
the
cloak
again
but
the
damage
was
done
Harry
Ron
said
stumbling
forward
and
staring
hopelessly
the
point
where
Harry
had
disappeared
you
better
run
for
Malfoy
tells
anyone
you
better
get
back
the
castle
quick
See
you
later
said
Harry
and
without
another
word
tore
back
down
the
path
toward
Hogsmeade
Would
Malfoy
believe
what
had
seen
Would
anyone
believe
Malfoy
Nobody
knew
about
the
Invisibility
Cloak
nobody
except
Dumbledore
Harry
stomach
turned
over
Dumbledore
would
know
exactly
what
had
happened
Malfoy
said
any
thing
Back
into
Honeydukes
back
down
the
cellar
steps
across
the
stone
floor
through
the
trapdoor
Harry
pulled
off
the
cloak
tucked
under
his
arm
and
ran
flat
out
along
the
passage
Malfoy
would
get
back
first
how
long
would
take
him
find
teacher
Panting
sharp
pain
his
side
Harry
didn
slow
down
until
reached
the
stone
slide
would
have
leave
the
cloak
where
was
was
too
much
giveaway
case
Malfoy
had
tipped
off
teacher
hid
shadowy
corner
then
started
climb
fast
could
his
sweaty
hands
slipping
the
sides
the
chute
reached
the
inside
the
witch
hump
tapped
with
his
wand
stuck
his
head
through
and
hoisted
himself
out
the
hump
closed
and
just
Harry
jumped
out
from
behind
the
statue
heard
quick
footsteps
approaching
was
Snape
approached
Harry
swift
walk
his
black
robes
swishing
then
stopped
front
him
said
There
was
look
surpressed
triumph
about
him
Harry
tried
look
innocent
all
too
aware
his
sweaty
face
and
his
muddy
hands
which
quickly
hid
his
pockets
Come
with
Potter
said
Snape
Harry
followed
him
downstairs
trying
wipe
his
hands
clean
the
inside
his
robes
without
Snape
noticing
They
walked
down
the
stairs
the
dungeons
and
then
into
Snape
office
Harry
had
been
here
only
once
before
and
had
been
very
serious
trouble
then
too
Snape
had
aquired
few
more
slimy
horrible
things
jars
since
last
time
all
standing
shelves
behind
his
desk
glinting
the
firelight
and
adding
the
threatening
atmosphere
Sit
said
Snape
Harry
sat
Snape
however
remained
standing
Malfoy
has
just
been
see
with
strange
story
Potter
said
Snape
Harry
didn
say
anything
tells
that
was
the
Shrieking
Shack
when
ran
into
Weasley
apparently
alone
Still
Harry
didn
speak
Malfoy
states
that
was
standing
talking
Weasley
when
large
amount
mud
hit
him
the
back
the
head
How
you
think
that
could
have
happened
Harry
tried
look
mildly
surprised
don
know
Professor
Snape
eyes
were
boring
into
Harry
was
exactly
like
trying
stare
down
hippogriff
Harry
tried
hard
not
blink
Malfoy
then
saw
extraordinary
apparition
Can
you
imagine
what
might
have
been
Potter
said
Harry
now
trying
sound
innocently
curious
was
your
head
Potter
Floating
midair
There
was
long
silence
Maybe
better
Madam
Pomfrey
said
Harry
seeing
things
like
What
would
your
head
have
been
doing
Hogsmeade
Potter
said
Snape
softly
Your
head
not
allowed
Hogsmeade
part
your
body
has
permission
Hogsmeade
know
that
said
Harry
striving
keep
his
face
free
guilt
fear
sounds
like
Malfoy
having
hallucin
Malfoy
not
having
hallucinations
snarled
Snape
and
bent
down
hand
each
arm
Harry
chair
that
their
faces
were
foot
apart
your
head
was
Hogsmeade
was
the
rest
you
been
Gryffindor
Tower
said
Harry
Like
you
told
Can
anyone
confirm
that
Harry
didn
say
anything
Snape
thin
mouth
curled
into
horrible
smile
said
straightening
again
Everyone
from
the
Minister
Magic
downward
has
been
trying
keep
famous
Harry
Potter
safe
from
Sirius
Black
But
famous
Harry
Potter
law
unto
himself
Let
the
ordinary
people
worry
about
his
safety
Famous
Harry
Potter
goes
where
wants
with
thought
for
the
consequences
Harry
stayed
silent
Snape
was
trying
provoke
him
into
telling
the
truth
wasn
going
Snape
had
proof
yet
How
extraordinarily
like
your
father
you
are
Potter
Snape
said
suddenly
his
eyes
glinting
too
was
exceedingly
arrogant
small
amount
talent
the
Quidditch
field
made
him
think
was
cut
above
the
rest
too
Strutting
around
the
place
with
his
friends
and
admirers
The
resemblance
between
you
uncanny
dad
didn
strut
said
Harry
before
could
stop
himself
And
neither
Your
father
didn
set
much
store
rules
either
Snape
went
pressing
his
advantage
his
thin
face
full
malice
Rules
were
for
lesser
mortals
not
Quidditch
Cup
winners
His
head
was
swollen
SHUT
Harry
was
suddenly
his
feet
Rage
such
had
not
felt
since
his
last
night
Privet
Drive
was
coursing
through
him
didn
care
that
Snape
face
had
gone
rigid
the
black
eyes
flashing
dangerously
What
did
you
say
Potter
told
you
shut
about
dad
Harry
yelled
know
the
truth
all
right
saved
your
life
Dumbledore
told
You
wouldn
even
here
wasn
for
dad
Snape
sallow
skin
had
gone
the
color
sour
milk
And
did
the
headmaster
tell
you
the
circumstances
which
your
father
saved
life
whispered
did
consider
the
details
too
unpleasant
for
precious
Potter
delicate
ears
Harry
bit
his
lip
didn
know
what
had
happened
and
didn
want
admit
but
Snape
seemed
have
guessed
the
truth
would
hate
for
you
run
away
with
false
idea
your
father
Potter
said
terrible
grin
twisting
his
face
Have
you
been
imagining
some
act
glorious
heroism
Then
let
correct
you
your
saintly
father
and
his
friends
played
highly
amusing
joke
that
would
have
resulted
death
your
father
hadn
got
cold
feet
the
last
moment
There
was
nothing
brave
about
what
did
was
saving
his
own
skin
much
mine
Had
their
joke
succeeded
would
have
been
expelled
from
Hogwarts
Snape
uneven
yellowish
teeth
were
bared
Turn
out
your
pockets
Potter
spat
suddenly
Harry
didn
move
There
was
pounding
his
ears
Turn
out
your
pockets
straight
the
headmaster
Pull
them
out
Potter
Cold
with
dread
Harry
slowly
pulled
out
the
bag
Zonko
tricks
and
the
Marauder
Map
Snap
picked
the
Zonko
bag
Ron
gave
them
said
Harry
praying
get
chance
tip
Ron
off
before
Snape
saw
him
brought
them
back
from
Hogsmeade
last
time
Indeed
And
you
been
carrying
them
around
ever
since
How
very
touching
and
what
this
Snape
had
picked
the
map
Harry
tried
with
all
his
might
keep
his
face
impassive
Spare
bit
parchment
said
with
shrug
Snape
turned
over
his
eyes
Harry
Surely
you
don
need
such
very
old
piece
parchment
said
Why
don
just
throw
this
away
His
hand
moved
toward
the
fire
Harry
said
quickly
said
Snape
his
long
nostrils
quivering
this
another
treasured
gift
from
Weasley
something
else
letter
perhaps
written
invisible
ink
instructions
get
into
Hogsmeade
without
passing
the
dementors
Harry
blinked
Snape
eyes
gleamed
Let
see
let
see
muttered
taking
out
his
wand
and
smoothing
the
map
out
his
desk
Reveal
your
secret
said
touching
the
wand
the
parchment
Nothing
happened
Harry
clenched
his
hands
stop
them
from
shaking
Show
yourself
Snape
said
tapping
the
map
sharply
stayed
blank
Harry
was
taking
deep
calming
breaths
Professor
Severus
Snape
master
this
school
commands
you
yield
the
information
you
conceal
Snape
said
hitting
the
map
with
his
wand
though
invisible
hand
were
writing
upon
words
appeared
the
smooth
surface
the
map
Mooney
presents
his
compliments
Professor
Snape
and
begs
him
keep
his
abnormally
large
nose
out
other
people
business
Snape
froze
Harry
stared
dumbstruck
the
message
But
the
map
didn
stop
there
More
writing
was
appearing
beneath
the
first
Prongs
agrees
with
Moony
and
would
like
add
that
Professor
Snape
ugle
git
would
have
been
very
funny
the
situation
hadn
been
serious
And
there
was
more
Padfoot
would
like
register
his
astonishment
that
idiot
like
that
ever
became
professor
Harry
closed
his
eyes
horror
When
opened
them
the
map
had
had
its
last
word
Wormtail
bids
Professor
Snape
good
day
and
advises
him
wash
his
hair
the
slimeball
Harry
waited
for
the
blow
fall
said
Snape
softly
see
about
this
strode
across
his
fire
seized
fistful
glittering
powder
from
jar
the
fireplace
and
threw
into
the
flames
Lupin
Snape
called
into
the
fire
want
word
Utterly
bewildered
Harry
stared
the
fire
large
shape
had
appeared
revolving
very
fast
Seconds
later
Professor
Lupin
was
clambering
out
the
fireplace
brushing
ash
off
his
shabby
robes
You
called
Severus
said
Lupin
mildly
certainly
did
said
Snape
his
face
contorted
with
fury
strode
back
his
desk
have
just
asked
Potter
empty
his
pockets
was
carrying
this
Snape
pointed
the
parchment
which
the
words
Messrs
Moony
Wormtail
Padfoot
and
Prongs
were
still
shining
odd
closed
expression
appeared
Lupin
face
Well
said
Snape
Lupin
continued
stare
the
map
Harry
had
the
impression
that
Lupin
was
doing
some
very
quick
thinking
Well
said
Snape
again
This
parchment
plainly
full
Dark
Magic
This
supposed
your
area
expertise
Lupin
Where
you
imagine
Potter
got
such
thing
Lupin
looked
and
the
merest
half
glance
Harry
direction
warned
him
not
interrupt
Full
Dark
Magic
repeated
mildly
you
really
think
Severus
looks
though
merely
piece
parchment
that
insults
anybody
who
reads
Childish
but
surely
not
dangerous
imagine
Harry
got
from
joke
shop
Indeed
said
Snape
His
jaw
had
gone
rigid
with
anger
You
think
joke
shop
could
supply
him
with
such
thing
You
don
think
more
likely
that
got
directly
from
the
manufacturers
Harry
didn
understand
what
Snape
was
talking
about
Nor
apparently
did
Lupin
You
mean
Wormtail
one
these
people
said
Harry
you
know
any
these
men
said
Harry
quickly
You
see
Severus
said
Lupin
turning
back
Snape
looks
like
Zonko
product
Right
cue
Ron
came
bursting
into
the
office
was
completely
out
breath
and
stopped
just
short
Snape
desk
clutching
the
stitch
his
chest
and
trying
speak
gave
Harry
that
stuff
choked
Bought
Zonko
ages
ago
Well
said
Lupin
clapping
his
hands
together
and
looking
around
cheerfully
That
seems
clear
that
Severus
take
this
back
shall
folded
the
map
and
tucked
inside
his
robes
Harry
Ron
come
with
need
word
about

Severus
Harry
didn
dare
look
Snape
they
left
his
office
Ron
and
Lupin
walked
all
the
way
back
into
the
entrance
hall
before
speaking
Then
Harry
turned
Lupin
Professor
don
want
hear
explanations
said
Lupin
shortly
glanced
around
the
empty
entrance
hall
and
lowered
his
voice
happen
know
that
this
map
was
confiscated
Filch
many
years
ago
Yes
know
map
said
Harry
and
Ron
looked
amazed
don
want
know
how
fell
into
your
possession
however
astounded
that
you
didn
hand
Particularly
after
what
happened
the
last
time
student
left
information
about
the
castle
lying
around
And
can
let
you
have
back
Harry
Harry
had
expected
that
and
was
too
keen
for
explanations
protest
Why
did
Snape
think
got
from
the
manufacturers
Because
Lupin
hesitated
because
these
mapmakers
would
have
wanted
lure
you
out
school
They
think
extremely
entertaining
you
know
them
said
Harry
impressed
met
said
shortly
was
looking
Harry
more
seriously
than
ever
before
Don
expect
cover
for
you
again
Harry
cannot
make
you
take
Sirius
Black
seriously
But
would
have
thought
that
what
you
have
heard
when
the
dementors
draw
near
you
would
have
had
more
effect
you
Your
parents
gave
their
lives
keep
you
alive
Harry
poor
way
repay
them
gambling
their
sacrifice
for
bag
magic
tricks
walked
away
leaving
Harry
feeling
worse
far
than
had
any
point
Snape
office
Slowly
and
Ron
mounted
the
marble
staircase
Harry
passed
the
one
eyed
witch
remembered
the
Invisibility
Cloak
was
still
down
there
but
didn
dare
and
get
fault
said
Ron
abruptly
persuaded
you
Lupin
right
was
stupid
shouldn
done
broke
off
they
reached
the
corridor
where
the
security
trolls
were
pacing
and
Hermione
was
walking
toward
them
One
look
her
face
convinced
Harry
that
she
had
heard
what
had
happened
His
heart
plummeted
had
she
told
Professor
McGonagall
Come

good
gloat
said
Ron
savagely
she
stopped
front
them
have
you
just
been

said
Hermione
She
was
holding
letter
her
hands
and
her
lip
was
trembling
just
thought
you

know
Hagrid

THE
QUIDDITCH
FINAL
sent

Hermione
said
holding
out
the
letter
Harry
took
The
parchment
was
damp
and
enormous
teardrops
had
smudged
the
ink
badly
places
that
was
very
difficult
read
Dear

Harry

said
Hermione
wiping
her
eyes
You

They

doddery
old
fools
and
they
were
scared
There
appeal
though
there
always
Only

Nothing

Yeah

said
Ron
fiercely
You
won
have
all
the
work
alone
this
time
Hermione
help
Ron
Hermione
flung
her
arms
around
Ron
neck
and
broke
down
completely
Ron
looking
quite
terrified
patted
her
very
awkwardly
the
top
the
head
Finally
Hermione
drew
away
Ron
really
really
sorry
about
Scabbers
she
sobbed
well
was
old
said
Ron
looking
thoroughly
relieved
that
she
had
let
him
And
was
bit
useless
You
never
know
Mum
and
Dad
might
get
owl
now
The
safety
measures
imposed
the
students
since
Black
second
break
made
impossible
for
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
and
visit
Hagrid
the
evenings
Their
only
chance
talking
him
was
during
Care
Magical
Creatures
lessons
seemed
numb
with
shock
the
verdict
all
fault
Got

They

sittin
there
black
robes
kep
droppin
notes

Lucius
Malfoy

and
the
Committee

There
still
the
appeal
said
Ron
fiercely
Don
give
Yet
working
They
were
walking
back
the
castle
with
the
rest
the
class
Ahead
they
could
see
Malfoy
who
was
walking
with
Crabbe
and
Goyle
and
kept
looking
back
laughing
derisively
good
Ron
said
Hagrid
sadly
they
reached
the
castle
steps
That
Committee
Lucius
Malfoy
pocket
jus

make
sure
the
rest
Beaky
time
the
happiest
ever

him
that
Hagrid
turned
around
and
hurried
back
toward
his
cabin
his
face
buried
his
handkerchief
Look
him
blubber
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
had
been
standing
just
inside
the
castle
doors
listening
Have
you
ever
seen
anything
quite
pathetic
said
Malfoy
And
supposed
our
teacher
Harry
and
Ron
both
made
furious
moves
toward
Malfoy
but
Hermione
got
there
first
SMACK
She
had
slapped
Malfoy
across
the
face
with
all
the
strength
she
could
muster
Malfoy
staggered
Harry
Ron
Crabbe
and
Goyle
stood
flabbergasted
Hermione
raised
her
hand
again
Don
you
dare
call
Hagrid
pathetic
you
foul
you
evil
Hermione
said
Ron
weakly
and
tried
grab
her
hand
she
swung
back
Get
off
Ron
Hermione
pulled
out
her
wand
Malfoy
stepped
backward
Crabbe
and
Goyle
looked
him
for
instructions
thoroughly
bewildered
mon
Malfoy
muttered
and
moment
all
three
them
had
disappeared
into
the
passageway
the
dungeons
Hermione
Ron
said
again
sounding
both
stunned
and
irnpressed
Harry

better
beat
him
the
Quidditch
final
Hermione
said
shrilly
You

better
had
because

stand
Slytherin
wins

Charms
said
Ron
still
goggling
Hermione
better
They
hurried
the
marble
staircase
toward
Professor
Flitwick
classroom
You

said
Professor
Flitwick
reprovingly
Harry
opened
the
classroom
door
Come

Harry
and
Ron
hurried

back
and
opened
their
bags
Ron
looked
behind
him
Where
Hermione
gone
Harry
looked
around
too
Hermione
hadn
entered
the
classroom
yet
Harry
knew
she
had
been
right
next
him
when
had
opened
the
door
That
weird
said
Harry
staring
Ron
Maybe

she
went

bathroom

But
Hermione

turn

said
Ron
the

feeling
great
contentment
Hermione

time
they
had
finished
their
apple
pie
the
after
effects
the
Cheering
Charms
were
wearing
off
and
Harry
and
Ron
had
started
get
slightly
worried
You
don
think
Malfoy
did
something
her
Ron
said
anxiously
they
hurried
upstairs
toward
Gryffindor
Tower
They
passed
the
security
trolls
gave
the
Fat
Lady
the
password
Flibbertigibbet
and
scrambled
through
the
portrait
hole
into
the
common
room
Hermione
was
sitting
table
fast
asleep
her
head
resting
open
Arithmancy
book
They
went
sit
down
either
side
her
Harry
prodded
her
awake
what
said
Hermione
waking
with
start
and
staring
wildly
around
time
which

Divination
but

twenty
minutes
said
Harry
Hermione

said
Harry
You

Hermione
wailed
Was
Professor
Flitwick
angry
was
Malfoy
was
thinking
about
him
and
lost
track
things
You
know
what
Hermione
said
Ron
looking
down
the
enormous
Arithmancy
book
Hermione
had
been
using
pillow
reckon
you
cracking
You
trying
too
much
not
said
Hermione
brushing
her
hair
out
her
eyes
and
staring
hopelessly
around
for
her
bag
just
made
mistake
that
all
better
and
see
Professor
Flitwick
and
say
sorry
see
you
Divination
Hermione
joined
them
the
foot
the
ladder
Professor
Trelawneys
classroom
twenty
minutes
later
looking
extremely
harrassed
can
believe
missed
Cheering
Charms
And
bet
they
come
our
exams
Professor
Flitwick
hinted
they
might
Together
they
climbed
the
ladder
into
the
dim
stifling
tower
room
Glowing
every
little
table
was
crystal
ball
full
pearly
white
mist
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
down
together
the
same
rickety
table
thought
weren
starting
crystal
balls
until
next
term
Ron
muttered
casting
wary
eye
around
for
Professor
Trelawney
case
she
was
lurking
nearby
Don
complain
this
means
finished
palmistry
Harry
muttered
back
was
getting
sick
her
flinching
every
time
she
looked
hands
Good
day
you
said
the
familiar
misty
voice
and
Professor
Trelawney
made
her
usual
dramatic
entrance
out
the
shadows
Parvati
and
Lavender
quivered
with
excitement
their
faces
lit
the
milky
glow
their
crystal
ball
have
decided
introduce
the
crystal
ball
little
earlier
than
had
planned
said
Professor
Trelawney
sitting
with
her
back
the
fire
and
gazing
around
The
fates
have
informed
that
your
examination
June
will
concern
the
Orb
and
anxious
give
you
sufficient
practice
Hermione
snorted
Well
honestly
the
fates
have
informed
her
who
sets
the
exam
She
does
What
amazing
prediction
she
said
not
troubling
keep
her
voice
low
Harry
and
Ron
choked
back
laughs
was
hard
tell
whether
Professor
Trelawney
had
heard
them
her
face
was
hidden
shadow
She
continued
however
though
she
had
not
Crystal
gazing
particularly
refined
art
she
said
dreamily
not
expect
any
you
See
when
first
you
peer
into
the
Orb
infinite
depths
shall
start
practicing
relaxing
the
conscious
mind
and
external
eyes
Ron
began
snigger
uncontrollably
and
had
stuff
his
fist
his
mouth
stifle
the
noise
clear
the
Inner
Eye
and
the
superconscious
Perhaps
are
lucky
some
you
will
see
before
the
end
the
class
And
they
began
Harry
least
felt
extremely
foolish
staring
blankly
the
crystal
ball
trying
keep
his
mind
empty
when
thoughts
such
this
stupid
kept
drifting
across
didn
help
that
Ron
kept
breaking
into
silent
giggles
and
Hermione
kept
tutting
Seen
anything
yet
Harry
asked
them
after
quarter
hour
quiet
crystal
gazing
Yeah
there
burn
this
table
said
Ron
pointing
Someone
spilled
their
candle
This
such
waste
time
Hermione
hissed
could
practicing
something
useful
could
catching
Cheering
Charms
Professor
Trelawney
rustled
past
Would
anyone
like
help
them
interpret
the
shadowy
portents
within
their
Orb
she
murmured
over
the
clinking
her
bangles
don
need
help
Ron
whispered
obvious
what
this
means
There
going
loads
fog
tonight
Both
Harry
and
Hermione
burst
out
laughing
Now
really
said
Professor
Trelawney
everyone
heads
turned
their
direction
Parvati
and
Lavender
were
looking
scandalized
You
are
disturbing
the
clairvoyant
vibrations
She
approached
their
table
and
peered
into
their
crystal
ball
Harry
felt
his
heart
sinking
was
sure
knew
what
was
coming
There
something
here
Professor
Trelawney
whispered
lowerng
her
face
the
ball
that
was
reflected
twice
her
huge
glasses
Something
moving
but
what
Harry
was
prepared
bet
everything
owned
Including
his
Firebolt
that
wasn
good
news
whatever
was
And
sure
enough
dear
Professor
Trelawney
breathed
gazing
Harry
here
plainer
than
ever
before
dear
stalking
toward
you
growing
ever
closer
the
for
goodness
sake
said
Hermione
loudly
Not
that
ridiculous
Grim
again
Professor
Trelawney
raised
her
enormous
eyes
Hermione
face
Parvati
whispered
something
Lavender
and
they
both
glared
Hermione
too
Professor
Trelawney
stood
surveying
Hermione
with
unmistakable
anger
sorry
say
that
from
the
moment
you
have
arrived
this
class
dear
has
been
apparent
that
you
not
have
what
the
noble
art
Divination
requires
Indeed
don
remember
ever
meeting
student
whose
mind
was
hopelessly
mundane
There
was
moment
silence
Then
Fine
said
Hermione
suddenly
getting
and
cramming
Unfogging
the
Future
back
into
her
bag
Fine
she
repeated
swinging
the
bag
over
her
shoulder
and
almost
knocking
Ron
off
his
chair
give
leaving
And
the
whole
class
amazement
Hermione
strode
over
the
trapdoor
kicked
open
and
climbed
down
the
ladder
out
sight
took
few
minutes
for
the
class
settle
down
again
Professor
Trelawney
seemed
have
forgotten
all
about
the
Grim
She
turned
abruptly
from
Harry
and
Ron
table
breathing
rather
heavily
she
tugged
her
gauzy
shawl
more
closely
her
Ooooo
said
Lavender
suddenly
making
everyone
start
Ooooo
Professor
Trelawney
just
remembered
You
saw
her
leaving
didn
you
Didn
you
Professor
Around
Easter
one
our
number
will
leave
forever
You
said
ages
ago
Professor
Professor
Trelawney
gave
her
dewy
smile
Yes
dear
did
indeed
know
that
Miss
Granger
would
leaving
One
hopes
however
that
one
might
have
mistaken
the
Signs
The
Inner
Eye
can
burden
you
know
Lavender
and
Parvati
looked
deeply
impressed
and
moved
over
that
Professor
Trelawney
could
join
their
table
instead
Some
day
Hermione
having
Ron
muttered
Harry
looking
awed
Yeah
Harry
glanced
into
the
crystal
ball
but
saw
nothing
but
swirling
white
mist
Had
Professor
Trelawney
really
seen
the
Grim
again
Would
The
last
thing
needed
was
another
near
fatal
accident
with
the
Quidditch
final
drawing
ever
nearer
The
Easter
holidays
were
not
exactly
relaxing
The
third
years
had
never
had
much
homework
Neville
Longbottom
seemed
close
nervous
collapse
and
wasn
the
only
one
Call
this
holiday
Seamus
Finnigan
roared
the
common
room
one
afternoon
The
exams
are
ages
away
what
they
playing
But
nobody
had
much
Hermione
Even
without
Divination
she
was
taking
more
subjects
than
anybody
else
She
was
usually
last
leave
the
common
room
night
first
arrive
the
library
the
next
morning
she
had
shadows
like
Lupin
under
her
eyes
and
seemed
constantly
close
tears
Ron
had
taken
over
responsibility
for
Buckbeak
appeal
When
wasn
doing
his
own
work
was
poring
over
enormously
thick
volumes
with
names
like
The
Handbook
Hippogriff
Psychology
and
Fowl
Foul
Study
Hippogriff
Brutality
was
absorbed
even
forgot
horrible
Crookshanks
Harry
meanwhile
had
fit
his
homework
around
Quidditch
practice
every
day
not
mention
endless
discussions
tactics
with
Wood
The
Gryffindor
Slytherin
match
would
take
place
the
first
Saturday
after
the
Easter
holidays
Slytherin
was
leading
the
tournament
exactly
two
hundred
points
This
meant
Wood
constantly
reminded
his
team
that
they
needed
win
the
match
more
than
that
amount
win
the
Cup
also
meant
that
the
burden
winning
fell
largely
Harry
because
capturing
the
Snitch
was
worth
one
hundred
and
fifty
points
you
must
catch
only
more
than
fifty
points
Wood
told
Harry
constantly
Only
more
than
fifty
points
Harry
win
the
match
but
lose
the
Cup
You
got
that
Haven
you
You
must
catch
the
Snitch
only
KNOW
OLIVER
Harry
yelled
The
whole
Gryffindor
House
was
obsessed
with
the
coming
match
Gryffindor
hadn
won
the
Quidditch
Cup
since
the
legendary
Charlie
Weasley
Ron
second
oldest
brother
had
been
seeker
But
Harry
doubted
whether
any
them
even
Wood
wanted
win
much
did
The
enmity
between
Harry
and
Malfoy
was
its
highest
point
ever
Malfoy
was
still
smarting
bout
the
mud
throwing
incident
Hogsmeade
and
was
even
more
furious
that
Harry
had
somehow
wormed
his
way
out
punishment
Harry
hadn
forgotten
Malfoy
attempt
sabotage
him
the
match
against
Ravenclaw
but
was
the
matter
Buckbeak
that
made
him
most
determined
beat
Malfoy
front
the
entire
school
Never
anyone
memory
had
match
approached
such
highly
charged
atmosphere
the
time
the
holidays
were
over
tension
between
the
two
teams
and
their
Houses
was
the
breaking
point
number
small
scuffles
broke
out
the
corridors
culminating
nasty
incident
which
Gryffindor
fourth
year
and
Slytherin
sixth
year
ended
the
hospital
wing
with
leeks
sprouting
out
their
ears
Harry
was
having
particularly
bad
time
couldn
walk
class
without
Slytherins
sticking
out
their
legs
and
trying
trip
him
Crabbe
and
Goyle
kept
popping
wherever
went
and
slouching
away
looking
disappointed
when
they
saw
him
surrounded
people
Wood
had
given
instructions
that
Harry
should
accompanied
everywhere
went
case
the
Slytherins
tried
put
him
out
action
The
whole
Gryffindor
House
took
the
challenge
enthusiastically
that
was
impossible
for
Harry
get
classes
time
because
was
surrounded
vast
chattering
crowd
Harry
was
more
concerned
for
his
Firebolt
safety
than
his
own
When
wasn
flying
locked
securely
his
trunk
and
frequently
dashed
back
Gryffindor
Tower
break
times
check
that
was
still
there
All
usual
pursuits
were
abandoned
the
Gryffindor
common
room
the
night
before
the
match
Even
Hermione
had
Put
down
her
books
can
work
can
concentrate
she
said
nervously
There
was
great
deal
noise
Fred
and
George
Weasley
were
dealing
with
the
pressure
being
louder
and
more
exuberant
than
ever
Oliver
Wood
was
crouched
over
model
Quidditch
field
the
corner
prodding
little
figures
across
with
his
wand
and
muttering
himself
Angelina
Alicia
and
Katie
were
laughing
Fred
and
George
jokes
Harry
was
sitting
with
Ron
and
Hermione
removed
from
the
center
things
trying
not
think
about
the
next
day
because
every
time
did
had
the
horrible
sensation
that
something
very
large
was
fighting
get
out
his
stomach
You
going
fine
Hermione
told
him
though
she
looked
positively
terrified
You
got
Firebolt
said
Ron
Yeah
said
Harry
his
stomach
writhing
came
relief
when
Wood
suddenly
stood
and
yelled
Team
Bed
Harry
slept
badly
First
dreamed
that
had
overslept
and
that
Wood
was
yelling
Where
were
you
had
use
Neville
instead
Then
dreamed
that
Malfoy
and
the
rest
the
Slytherin
team
arrived
for
the
match
riding
dragons
was
flying
breakneck
speed
trying
avoid
spurt
flames
from
Malfoy
steed
mouth
when
realized
had
forgotten
his
Firebolt
fell
through
the
air
and
woke
with
start
was
few
seconds
before
Harry
remembered
that
the
match
hadn
taken
place
yet
that
was
safe
bed
and
that
the
Slytherin
team
definitely
wouldn
allowed
play
dragons
was
feeling
very
thirsty
Quietly
could
got
out
his
four
poster
and
went
pour
himself
some
water
from
the
silver
jug
beneath
the
window
The
grounds
were
still
and
quiet
breath
wind
disturbed
the
treetops
the
Forbidden
Forest
the
Whomping
Willow
was
motionless
and
innocent
looking
looked
though
the
conditions
for
the
match
would
perfect
Harry
set
down
his
goblet
and
was
about
turn
back
his
bed
when
something
caught
his
eye
animal
some
kind
was
prowling
across
the
silvery
lawn
Harry
dashed
his
bedside
table
snatched
his
glasses
and
put
them
then
hurried
back
the
window
couldn
the
Grim
not
now
not
right
before
the
match
peered
out
the
grounds
again
and
after
minute
frantic
searching
spotted
was
skirting
the
edge
the
forest
now
wasn
the
Grim
all
was
cat
Harry
clutched
the
window
ledge
relief
recognized
the
bottlebrush
tail
was
only
Crookshanks
was
only
Crookshanks
Harry
squinted
pressing
his
nose
flat
against
the
glass
Crookshanks
seemed
have
come
halt
Harry
was
sure
could
see
something
else
moving
the
shadow
the
trees
too
And
just
then
emerged
gigantic
shaggy
black
dog
moving
stealthily
across
the
lawn
Crookshanks
trotting
its
side
Harry
stared
What
did
this
mean
Crookshanks
could
see
the
dog
well
how
could
omen
Harry
death
Ron
Harry
hissed
Ron
Wake
Huh
need
you
tell
you
can
see
something
all
dark
Harry
Ron
muttered
thickly
What
you
about
Down
here
Harry
looked
quickly
back
out
the
window
Crookshanks
and
the
dog
had
vanished
Harry
climbed
onto
the
windowsill
look
right
down
into
the
shadows
the
castle
but
they
weren
there
Where
had
they
gone
loud
snore
told
him
Ron
had
fallen
asleep
again
Harry
and
the
rest
the
Gryffindor
team
entered
the
Great
Hall
the
next
day
enormous
applause
Harry
couldn
help
grinning
broadly
saw
that
both
the
Ravenclaw
and
Hufflepuff
tables
were
applauding
them
too
The
Slytherin
table
hissed
loudly
they
passed
Harry
noticed
that
Malfoy
looked
even
paler
than
usual
Wood
spent
the
whole
breakfast
urging
his
team
eat
while
touching
nothing
himself
Then
hurried
them
off
the
field
before
anyone
else
had
finished
they
could
get
idea
the
conditions
they
left
the
Great
Hall
everyone
applauded
again
Good
luck
Harry
called
Cho
Harry
felt
himself
blushing
Okay
wind
speak
sun
bit
bright
that
could
impair
your
vision
watch
out
for
ground
fairly
hard
good
that
give
fast
kickoff
Wood
paced
the
field
staring
around
with
the
team
behind
him
Finally
they
saw
the
front
doors
the
castle
open
the
distance
and
the
rest
the
school
spilling
onto
the
lawn
Locker
rooms
said
Wood
tersely
None
them
spoke
they
changed
into
their
scarlet
robes
Harry
wondered
they
were
feeling
like
was
though
eaten
something
extremely
wriggly
for
breakfast
what
seemed
like
time
all
Wood
was
saying
Okay
time
let
They
walked
out
onto
the
field
tidal
wave
noise
Threequarters
the
crowd
was
wearing
scarlet
rosettes
waving
scarlet
flags
with
the
Gryffindor
lion
upon
them
brandishing
banners
with
slogans
like
GRYFFINDOR
and
LIONS
FOR
THE
CUK
Behind
the
Slytherin
goal
posts
however
two
hundred
people
were
wearing
green
the
silver
serpent
Slytherin
glittered
their
flags
and
Professor
Snape
sat
the
very
front
row
wearing
green
like
everyone
else
and
very
grim
smile
And

Gryffindors

Lee

Lee
comments
were
drowned

boos
from
the
Slytherin
end
And
here
come
the
Slytherin
team
led
Captain
Flint
Made
some
changes
the
lineup
and
seems
going
for
size
rather
than
skill
More
boos
from
the
Slytherin
crowd
Harry
however
thought
Lee
had
point
Malfoy
was
easily
the
smallest
person
the
Slytherin
team
the
rest
them
were
enormous
Captains

said
Madam
Hooch
Flint
and
Wood
approached
each

and
grasped
each

hand
very
tightly

was
trying

the
other
fingers
Mount

Madam
Hooch
Three

The
sound
her
whistle
was
lost
the
roar
from
the
crowd
fourteen
brooms
rose
into
the
air
Harry
felt
his
hair
fly
back
off
his
forehead
his
nerves
left
him

thrill
the
flight
glanced
around
saw
Malfoy

into
the

Harry

Enraged
that

taken
such
early
lead
the
Slytherins
were

The
Gryffindor

below
was
screaming
itself
hoarse
Gryffindor
was
sixty
points
the
lead
and
Harry
caught
the
Snitch
now
the
Cup
was
theirs
Harry
could
almost
feel
hundreds
eyes
following
him
soared
around
the
field
high
above
the
rest
the
game
with
Malfoy
speeding
along
behind
him
And
then
saw
The
Snitch
was
sparkling
twenty
feet
above
him
Harry
put
huge
burst
speed
the
wind
was
roaring
his
ears
stretched
out
his
hand
but
suddenly
the
Firebolt
was
slowing
down
Horrified
looked
around
Malfoy
had
thrown
himself
forward
grabbed
hold
the
Firebolt
tail
and
was
pulling
back
You
Harry
was
angry
enough
hit
Malfoy
but
couldn

Malfoy
was
panting
with
the
effort
holding
onto
the
Firebolt
but
his
eyes
were
sparkling
maliciously

achieved
what
wanted
the
Snitch
had
disappeared
again

fallen
off
and
she
too
was
shouting
furiously
Alicia
took
Gryffindor

but
she
was
angry
she
missed

Get

and
found

blocking
him

Harry
looked
around
Every
single
Slytherin
player
apart
from
Malfoy
was
streaking
the
pitch
toward
Angelina
including
the
Slytherin
Keeper
they
were
all
going
block
her
Harry
wheeled
the
Firebolt
around
bent
low
was
lying
flat
along
the
handle
and
kicked
forward
Like
bullet

toward
the
Slytherins

and
zoomed
back
into
the
middle
the
field
And
then
saw
something
make
his
heart
stand
still
Malfoy
was
diving
look
triumph
his
face
there
few
feet
above
the
grass
below
was
tiny
golden
glimmer
Harry
urged
the
Firebolt
downward
but
Malfoy
was
miles
ahead
Harry
urged
his
broom
was

Malfay
Harry
flattened
himself
the

was
Malfoy

Harry
threw
himself
forward
took
both
hands
off
his
broom
knocked
Malfoy
arm
out
the
way
and
YES
pulled
out
his
dive
his
hand
the
air
and
the
stadium
exploded
Harry
soared
above
the
crowd
odd
ringing
his
ears
The
tiny
golden
ball
was
held
tight
his
fist
beating
its
wings
hopelessly
against
his
fingers
Then
Wood
was
speeding
toward
him
half
blinded
tears
seized
Harry
around
the
neck
and
sobbed
unrestrainedly
into
his
shoulder
Harry
felt
two
large
thumps
Fred
and
George
hit
them
then
Angelina
Alicia
and
Katie
voices
won
the

Tangled

the

back
earth
Wave

crimson
supporters
was
pouring
over
the
barriers
onto
the
field
Hands
were
raining
down
their
backs
Harry
had
confused
impression
noise
and
bodies
pressing
him
Then
and
the
rest
the
team
were
hoisted
onto
the
shoulders
the
crowd
Thrust
into
the
light
saw
Hagrid
Plastered
with
crimson

Yeh

Wait

Buckbeak
There
was
Percy
jumping
and
down
like
maniac
all
dignity
forgotten
Professor
McGonagall
was
sobbing
harder
even
than
Wood
wiping
her
eyes
with
enormous
Gryffindor
flag
and
there
fighting
their
way
toward
Harry
were
Ron
and
Hermione
Words
failed
them
They
simply
beamed
Harry
was
borne
toward
the
stands
where
Dumbledore
stood
waiting
with
the
enormous
Quidditch
Cup
only
there
had
been

SIXTEEN
PROFESSOR
TRELAWNEY
PREDICTION
Harry
euphoria
finally
winning
the
Quidditch
Cup
lasted
least
week
Even
the
weather
seemed
celebrating
June
approached
the
days
became
cloudless
and
sultry
and
all
anybody
felt
like
doing
was
strolling
onto
the
grounds
and
flopping
down
the
grass
with
several
pints
iced
pumpkin
juice
perhaps
playing
casual
game
Gobstones
watching
the
giant
squid
propel
itself
dreamily
across
the
surface
the
lake
But
they
couldn
Exams
were
nearly
upon
them
and
instead
lazing
around
outside
the
students
were
forced
remain
inside
the
castle
trying
bully
their
brains
into
concentrating
while
enticing
wafts
summer
air
drifted
through
the
windows
Even
Fred
and
George
Weasley
had
been
spotted
working
they
were
about
take
their
Ordinary
Wizarding
Levels
Percy
was
getting
ready
take
his
Nastily
Exhausting
Wizarding
Tests
the
highest
qualification
Hogwarts
offered
Percy
hoped
enter
the
Ministry
Magic
needed
top
grades
was
becoming
increasingly
edgy
and
gave
very
severe
punishments
anybody
who
disturbed
the
quiet
the
common
room
the
evenings
fact
the
only
person
who
seemed
more
anxious
than
Percy
was
Hermione
Harry
and
Ron
had
given
asking
her
how
she
was
managing
attend
several
classes
once
but
they
couldn
restrain
themselves
when
they
saw
the
exam
schedule
she
had
drawn
for
herself
The
first
column
read
Monday
clock
Arithmancy
clock
Transfiguration
Lunch
clock
Charms
clock
Ancient
Runes
Hermione
Ron
said
cautiously
because
she
was
liable
explode
when
interrupted
these
days
are
you
sure
you
copied
down
these
times
right
What
snapped
Hermione
picking
the
exam
schedule
and
examining
Yes
course
have
there
any
point
asking
how

Harry
said
Hermione
shortly
Have

you
seen
copy
Numerology
and
Gramatica
yeah
borrowed
for
bit
bedtime
reading
said
Ron
but
very
quietly
Hermione
started
shifting
heaps
parchment
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
plenty
opportunity
speak
Hagrid
Beaky
gettin
bit
depressed
Hagrid
told
them
bending
low
the
pretense
checking
that
Harry
flobberworm
was
still
alive
Bin
cooped
too
long
But
still
know
day
after
tomorrow
one
way
the
other
They
had
Potions
that
afternoon
which
was
unqualified
disaster
Try
Harry
might
couldn
get
his
Confusing
Concoction
thicken
and
Snape
standing
watch
with
air
vindictive
pleasure
scribbled
something
that
looked
suspiciously
like
zero
onto
his
notes
before
moving
away
Then
came
Astronomy
midnight
the
tallest
tower
History
Magic
Wednesday
morning
which
Harry
scribbled
everything
Florean
Fortescue
had
ever
told
him
about
medieval
witch
hunts
while
wishing
could
have
had
one
Fortescue
choco
nut
sundaes
with
him
the
stifling
classroom
Wednesday
afternoon
meant
Herbology
the
greenhouses
under
baking
hot
sun
then
back
the
common
room
once
more
with
sunburnt
necks
thinking
longingly
this
time
next
day
when
would
all
over
Their
second
last
exam
Thursday
morning
was
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
Professor
Lupin
had
compiled
the
most
unusual
exam
any
them
had
ever
taken
sort
obstacle
course
outside
the
sun
where
they
had
wade
across
deep
paddling
pool
containing
grindylow
cross
series
potholes
full
Red
Caps
squish
their
way
across
patch
marsh
while
ignoring
misleading
directions
from
hinkypunk
then
climb
into
old
trunk
and
battle
with
new
boggart
Excellent
Harry
Lupin
muttered
Harry
climbed
out
the
trunk
grinning
Full
marks
Flushed
with
his
success
Harry
hung
around
watch
Ron
and
Hermione
Ron
did
very
well
until
reached
the
hinkypunk
which
successfully
confused
him
into
sinking
waist
high
into
the
quagmire
Hermione
did
everything
perfectly
until
she
reached
the
trunk
with
the
boggart
After
about
minute
inside
she
burst
out
again
screaming
Hermione
said
Lupin
startled
What
the
matter
Professor
McGonagall
Hermione
gasped
pointing
into
the
trunk
she
said
failed
everything
took
little
while
calm
Hermione
down
When
last
she
had
regained
grip
herself
she
Harry
and
Ron
went
back
the
castle
Ron
was
still
slightly
inclined
laugh
Hermione
boggart
but
argument
was
averted
the
sight
that
met
them
the
top
the
steps
Cornelius
Fudge
sweating
slightly
his
pinstriped
cloak
was
standing
there
staring
out
the
grounds
started
the
sight
Harry
Hello
there
Harry
said
Just
had
exam
expect
Nearly
finished
Yes
said
Harry
Hermione
and
Ron
not
being
speaking
terms
with
the
Minister
Magic
hovered
awkwardly
the
background
Lovely
day
said
Fudge
casting
eye
over
the
lake
Pity
pity
sighed
deeply
and
looked
down
Harry
here
unpleasant
mission
Harry
The
Committee
for
the
Disposal
Dangerous
Creatures
required
witness
the
execution
mad
hippogriff
needed
visit
Hogwarts
check
the
Black
situation
was
asked
step
Does
that
mean
the
appeal
already
happened
Ron
interrupted
stepping
forward
scheduled
for
this
afternoon
said
Fudge
looking
curiously
Ron
Then
you
might
not
have
witness
execution
said
Eon
stoutly
The
hippogriff
might
get
off
Before
Fudge
could
answer
two
wizards
came
through
the
castle
doors
behind
him
One
was
ancient
appeared
withering
before
their
very
eyes
the
other
was
tall
and
strapping
with
thin
back
mustache
Harry
gathered
that
they
were
representatives
the
Committee
for
the
Disposal
Dangerous
Creatures
because
tie
very
old
wizard
squinted
toward
Hagrid
cabin
and
said
feeble
voice
Dear
dear
getting
too
old
for
this
Two
clock
isn
Fudge
The
black
mustached
man
was
fingering
something
his
belt
Harry
looked
and
saw
that
was
running
one
broad
thumb
along
the
blade
shining
axe
Ron
opened
his
mouth
say
something
but
Hermione
nudged
him
hard
the
ribs
and
jerked
her
head
toward
the
entrance
hall
Why
you
stop
said
Ron
angrily
they
entered
the
Great
Hall
for
lunch
Did
you
see
them
They
even
got
the
axe
ready
This
isn
justice
Ron
your
dad
works
for
the
Ministry
you
can
saying
things
like
that
his
boss
said
Hermione
but
she
too
looked
very
upset
long
Hagrid
keeps
his
head
this
time
and
argue
case
properly
they
can
possibly
execute
Buckbeak
But
Harry
could
tell
Hermione
didn
really
believe
what
she
was
saying
All
around
them
people
were
talking
excitedly
they
ate
their
lunch
happily
anticipating
the
end
the
exams
that
afternoon
but
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
lost
worry
about
Hagrid
and
Buckbeak
didn
join
Harry
and
Ron
last
exam
was
Divination
Hermione
Muggle
Studies
They
walked
the
marble
staircase
together
Hermione
left
them
the
first
floor
and
Harry
and
Ron
proceeded
all
the
way
the
seventh
where
many
their
class
were
sitting
the
spiral
staircase
Professor
Trelawney
classroom
trying
cram
bit
last
minute
studying
She
seeing
all
separately
Neville
informed
them
they

pages
devoted
crystal
gazing
Have

crystal
ball
asked
them
unhappily
Nope
said
Ron
offhand
voice
kept
checking
his
watch
Harry
knew
that
was
counting
down
the
time
until
Buckbeak
appeal
started
The
line
people
outside
the
classroom
shortened
very
slowly
each
person
climbed
back
down
the
silver
ladder
the
rest
the
class
hissed
What
did
she
ask
Was
okay
But
they
all
refused
say
She
says
the
crystal
ball
told
her
that
tell
you
have
horrible
accident
squeaked
Neville
clambered
back
down
the
ladder
toward
Harry
and
Ron
who
had
now
reached
the
landing
That
convenient
snorted
Ron
You
know
starting
think
Hermione
was
right
about
her
jabbed
his
thumb
toward
the
trapdoor
overhead
she
right
old
fraud

said
Harry
looking
his
own
watch
was
now

clock
Wish
she
hurry
Parvati
came
back
down
the
ladder
glowing
with
pride
She
says
got
all
the
makings
true
Seer
she
informed
Harry
and
Ron
saw
loads
stuff
Well
good
luck
She
hurried
off
down
the
spiral
staircase
toward
Lavender
Ronald
Weasley
said
the
familiar
misty
voice
from
over
their
heads
Ron
grimaced
Harry
and
climbed
the
silver
ladder
out
sight
Harry
was
now
the
only
person
left
tested
settled
himself
the
floor
with
his
back
against
the
wall
listening
fly
buzzing
the
sunny
window
his
mind
across
the
grounds
with
Hagrid
Finally
after
about
twenty
minutes
Ron
large
feet
reappeared
the
ladder
How
Harry
asked
him
standing
Rubbish
said
Ron
Couldn
see
thing
made
some
stuff
Don
think
she
was
convinced
though
Meet
you
the
common
room
Harry
muttered
Professor
Trelawney
voice
called
Harry
Potter
The
tower
room
was
hotter
than
ever
before
the
curtains
were
closed
the
fire
was
alight
and
the
usual
sickly
scent
made
Harry
cough
stumbled
through
the
clutter
chairs
and
table
where
Professor
Trelawney
sat
waiting
for
him
before
large
crystal
ball
Good
day
dear
she
said
softly
you
would
kindly
gaze
into
the
Orb
Take
your
time
now
then
tell
what
you
see
within
Harry
bent
over
the
crystal
ball
and
stared
stared
hard
could
willing
show
him
something
other
than
swirling
white
fog
but
nothing
happened
Well
Professor
Trelawney
prompted
delicately
What
you
see
The
heat
was
overpowering
and
his
nostrils
were
stinging
with
the
perfumed
smoke
wafting
from
the
fire
beside
them
thought
what
Ron
had
just
said
and
decided
pretend

Harry
dark
shape
What
does
resemble
whispered
Professor
Trelawney
Think
now
Harry
cast
his
mind
around
and
landed
Buckbeak
hippogriff
said
firmly
Indeed
whispered
Professor
Trelawney
scribbling
keenly
the
parchment
perched
upon
her
knees
boy
you
may
well
seeing
the
outcome
poor
Hagrid
trouble
with
the
Ministry
Magic
Look
closer
Does
the
hippogriff
appear
have
its
head
Yes
said
Harry
firmly
Are
you
sure
Professor
Trelawney
urged
him
Are
you
quite
sure
dear
You
don
see
writhing
the
ground
perhaps
and
shadowy
figure
raising
axe
behind
said
Harry
starting
feel
slightly
sick
blood
weeping
Hagrid
said
Harry
again
wanting
more
than
ever
leave
the
room
and
the
heat
looks
fine
flying
away
Professor
Trelawney
sighed
Well
dear
think
leave
there
little
disappointing
but
sure
you
did
your
best
Relieved
Harry
got
picked
his
bag
and
turned
but
then
loud
harsh
voice
spoke
behind
him
WILL
HAPPEN
TONIGHT
Harry
wheeled
around
Professor
Trelawney
had
gone
rigid
her
armchair
her
eyes
were
unfocused
and
her
mouth
sagging
sorry
said
Harry
But
Professor
Trelawney
didn
seem
hear
him
Her
eyes
started
roll
Harry
sat
there
panic
She
looked
though
she
was
about
have
some
sort
seizure
hesitated
thinking
running
the
hospital
wing
and
then
Professor
Trelawney
spoke
again
the
same
harsh
voice
quite
unlike
her
own
THE
DARK
LORD
LIES
ALONE
AND
FRIENDLESS
ABANDONED
HIS
FOLLOWERS
HIS
SERVANT
HAS
BEEN
CHAINED
THESE
TWELVE
YEARS
TONIGHT
BEFORE
MIDNIGHT
THE
SERVANT
WILL
BREAK
FREE
AND
SET
OUT
REJOIN
HIS
MASTER
THE
DARK
LORD

WITH
HIS

GREATER
AND
MORE
TERRIBLE
THAN
EVER

TONIGHT
BEFORE
MIDNIGHT
THE
SERVANT
WILL
SET
REJOIN
HIS
MASTER
Professor
Trelawney
head
fell
forward
onto
her
chest
She
made
grunting
sort
noise
Harry
sat
there
staring
her
Then
quite
suddenly
Professor
Trelawney
head
snapped
again
sorry
dear
boy
she
said
dreamily
the
heat
the
day
you
know
drifted
off
for
moment
Harry
sat
there
staring
her
there
anything
wrong
dear
You
you
just
told
that
the
the
Dark
Lord
going
rise
again
that
his
servant
going
back
him
Professor
Trelawney
looked
thoroughly
startled
The
Dark
Lord
Who
Must
Not
Named
dear
boy
that
hardly
something
joke
about
Rise
again
indeed
But
you
just
said
You
said
the
Dark
Lord
think
you
must
have
dozed
off
too
dear
said
Professor
Trelawney
would
certainly
not
presume
predict
anything
quite
far
fetched
that
Harry
climbed
back
down
the
ladder
and
the
spiral
staircase
wondering
had
just
heard
Professor
Trelawney
make
real
prediction
had
that
been
her
idea
impressive
end
the
test
Five
minutes
later
was
dashing
past
the
security
trolls
outside
the
entrance
Gryffindor
Tower
Professor
Trelawney
words
still
resounding
his
head
People
were
striding
past
him
the
opposite
direction
laughing
and
joking
heading
for
the
grounds
and
bit
long
awaited
freedom
the
time
had
reached
the
portrait
hole
and
entered
the
common
room
was
almost
deserted
Over
the
corner
however
sat
Ron
and
Hermione
Professor
Trelawney
Harry
panted
just
told
But
stopped
abruptly
the
sight
their
faces
Buckbeak
lost
said
Ron
weakly
Hagrid
just
sent
this
Hagrid
note
was
dry
this
time
tears
had
splattered
yet
his
hand
seemed
have
shaken
much
wrote
that
was
hardly
legible
Lost
appeal
They
going

sunset
Nothing

can
Don
come
down

want

Hagrid

said
Harry
once
can
just
sit
there
his
own
waiting
for
the
executioner
Sunset
though
said
Ron
who
was
staring
out
the
window
ill
glazed
sort
way
never
allowed
specially
you
Harry
Harry
sank
his
head
into
his
hands
thinking
only
had
the
Invisibility
Cloak
Where
said
Hermione
Harry
told
her
about
leaving
the
passageway
under
the
one
eyed
witch
Snape

near
there
again
serious
trouble
finished
That

said
Hermione
getting
her
feet

How

the
witch
hump
again
You

and

Dissendium
said
Harry
But
Hermione
didn
wait
for
the
rest
his
sentence
she
strode
across
the
room
pushed
open
the
Fat
Lady
portrait
and
vanished
from
sight
She
hasn
gone
get
Ron
said
staring
after
her
She
had
Hermione
returned
quarter
hour
later
with
the
silvery
cloak
folded
carefully
under
her
robes
Hermione
don
know
what
gotten
into
you
lately
said
Ron
astounded
First
you
hit
Malfoy
then

walk
out
Professor
Trelawney
Hermione
looked
rather
flattered
They
went
down
dinner
with
everybody
else
but
did
not
return
Gryffindor
Tower
afterward
Harry
had
the
cloak
hidden
down
tie
front
his
robes
had
keep
his
arms
folded
hide
the
lump
They
skulked
empty
chamber
off
the
entrance
hall
listening
until
they
were
sure
was
deserted
They
heard
last
pair
people
hurrying
across
the
hall
and
door
slamming
Hermione
poked
her
head
around
the
door
Okay
she
whispered
one
there
cloak
Walking
very
close
together
that
nobody
would
see
them
they
crossed
the
hall
tiptoe
beneath
the
cloak
then
walked
down
the
stone
front
steps
into
the
grounds
The
sun
was
already
sinking
behind
the
Forbidden
Forest
gilding
the
top
branches
the
trees
They
reached
Hagrid
cabin
and
knocked
was
minute
answering
and
when
did
looked
all
around
for
his
visitor
pale
faced
and
trembling
Harry
hissed
wearing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
Let
and
can
take
off
Yeh
shouldn
come
Hagrid
whispered
but
stood
back
and
they
stepped
inside
Hagrid
shut
the
door
quickly
and
Harry
pulled
off
the
cloak
Hagrid
was
not
crying
nor
did
throw
himself
upon
their
necks
looked
like
man
who
did
not
know
where
was
what
This
helplessness
was
worse
watch
than
tears
Wan
some
tea
said
His
great
hands
were
shaking
reached
for
the
kettle
Where
Buckbeak
Hagrid
said
Hermione
hesitantly
took
him
outside
said
Hagrid
spilling
milk
all
over
the
table
filled
the
jug
tethered
pumpkin
patch
Thought
oughta
see
the
trees
smell
fresh
air
before
Hagrid
hand
trembled
violently
that
the
milk
jug
slipped
from
his
grasp
and
shattered
all
over
the
floor
Hagrid
said
Hermione
quickly
hurrying
over
and
starting
clean
the
mess
There
another
one
the
cupboard
Hagrid
said
sitting
down
and
wiping
his
forehead
his
sleeve
Harry
glanced
Ron
who
looked
back
hopelessly
Isn

Hagrid
Harry
asked
fiercely
sitting
down
next
him
Dumbledore

said
Hagrid

Buckbeak
all

they
scared
Yeh

Malfoy

the
executioner
Macnair
old
pal
Malfoy
but
quick
clean
beside
him
Hagrid
swallowed
His
eyes
were
darting
all
over
the
cabin
though
looking
for
some
shred
hope
comfort
Dumbledore

Silent
tears
were
now
streaming
down
Hermione
face
but
she
hid
them
from
Hagrid
bustling
around
making
tea
Then
she
picked
the
milk
bottle
pour
some
into
the
jug
she
let
out
shriek
Ron

Scabbers
Ron
gaped
her
What

Hermione
carried

over
the
table
and
turned
upside
down
With
frantic
squeak
and
much
scrambling
get
back
inside
Scabbers
the
rat
came
sliding
out
onto
the
table
Scabbers
said
Ron
blankly
Scabbers
what

grabbed
the
struggling
rat
and
held
him
the
light
Scabbers
looked
dreadful
was
thinner
than
ever
large
tufts
hair
had
fallen
out
leaving
wide
bald
patches
and
writhed
Ron
hands
though
desperate
free
himself
okay
Scabbers
said
Ron
cats
There

Hagrid
suddenly
stood
his
eyes
fixed
the
window
His
normally
ruddy
face
had
gone
the
color
parchment
They
comin
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
whipped
around
group
men
was
walking
down
the
distant
castle
steps
front
was
Albus
Dumbledore
his
silver
beard
gleaming
the
dying
sun
Next
him
trotted
Cornelius
Fudge
Behind
them
came
the
feeble
old
Committee
member
and
the
executioner
Macnair
Yeh

said
Hagrid
Every
inch
him
was
trembling
They
mustn

Ron
stuffed
Scabbers
into
his
pocket
and
Hermione
picked
the
cloak
let
yeh
out
the
back
way
said
Hagrid
They
followed
him
the
door
into
his
back
garden
Harry
felt
strangely
unreal
and
even
more
when
saw
Buckbeak
few
yards
away
tethered
tree
behind
Hagrid
Pumpkin
patch
Buckbeak
seemed
know
something
was
happening
turned
his
sharp
head
from
side
side
and
pawed
the
ground
nervously
okay
Beaky
said
Hagrid
softly
okay
turned
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
said
Get

But
they
didn
move
Hagrid
can
tell
them
what
really
happened
They
can
kill
him
said
Hagrid
fiercely
bad
enough
without
you
lot
trouble
all
They
had
choice
Hermione
threw
the
cloak
over
Harry
and
Ron
they
heard
voices
the
front
the
cabin
Hagrid
looked
the
place
where
they
had
just
vanished
from
sight
quick
said
hoarsely
Don
listen
And
strode
back
into
his
cabin
someone
knocked
the
front
door
Slowly
kind
horrified
trance
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
set
off
silently
around
Hagrid
house
they
reached
the
other
side
the
front
door
closed
with
sharp
snap
Please
let
hurry
Hermione
whispered
can
stand
can
bear
They
started
the
sloping
lawn
toward
the
castle
The
sun
was
sinking
fast
now
the
sky
had
turned
clear
purple
tinged
grey
but
the
west
there
was
ruby
red
glow
Ron
stopped
dead
please
Ron
Hermione
began
Scabbers
won
stay
put
Ron
was
bent
over
trying
keep
Scabbers
his
pocket
but
the
rat
was
going
berserk
squeaking
madly
twisting
and
flailing
trying
sink
his
teeth
into
Ron
hand
Scabbers
you
idiot
Ron
Ron
hissed
They
heard
door
open
behind
them
and
men
voices
Ron
please
let
move
they
going
Hermione
breathed
Okay
Scabbers
stay
put
They
walked
forward
Harry
like
Hermione
was
trying
not
listen
the
rumble
voices
behind
them
Ron
stopped
again
can
hold
him
Scabbers
shut
everyone
hear
The
rat
was
squealing
wildly
but
not
loudly
enough
cover
the
sounds
drifting
from
Hagrid
garden
There
was
jumble
indistinct
male
voices
silence
and
then
without
warning
the
unmistakable
swish
and
thud
axe
Hermione
swayed
the
spot
They
did
she
whispered
Harry
don
believe
they
did
CHAPTER
SEVENTEEN
CAT
RAT
AND
DOG
Harry
mind
had
gone
blank
with
shock
The
three
them
stood
transfixed
with
horror
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
The
very
last
rays
the
setting
sun
were
casting
bloody
light
over
the
long
shadowed
grounds
Then
behind
them
they
heard
wild
howling
Hagrid
Harry
muttered
Without
thinking
about
what
was
doing
made
turn
back
but
both
Ron
and
Hermione
seized
his
arms
can
said
Ron
who
was
paper
white
worse
trouble
they
know
been
see
him
Hermione
breathing
was
shallow
and
uneven
How
could
they
she
choked
How
could
they
Come
said
Ron
whose
teeth
seemed
chattering
They
set
off
back
toward
the
castle
walking
slowly
keep
themselves
hidden
under
the
cloak
The
light
was
fading
fast
now
the
time
they
reached
open
ground
darkness
was
settling
like
spell
around
them
Scabbers
keep
still
Ron
hissed
clamping
his
hand
over
his
chest
The
rat
was
wriggling
madly
Ron
came
sudden
halt
trying
force
Scabbers
deeper
into
his
pocket
What
the
matter
with
you
You
stupid
rat
Stay
still
OUCH
bit
Ron
quiet
Hermione
whispered
urgently
Fudge
out
here
minute
won
stay
put
Scabbers
was
plainly
terrified
was
writhing
with
all
his
might
trying
break
free
Ron
grip
What
the
matter
with
him
But
Harry
had
just
seen
stinking
toward
them
his
body
low
the
ground
wide
yellow
eyes
glinting
eerily
the
darkness
Crookshanks
Whether
could
see
them
was
following
the
sound
Scabbers
squeaks
Harry
couldn
tell
Crookshanks
Hermione
moaned
away
Crookshanks
away
But
the
cat
was
getting
nearer
Scabbers
Too
late
the
rat
had
slipped
between
Ron
clutching
fingers
hit
the
ground
and
scampered
away
one
bound
Crookshanks
sprang
after
him
and
before
Harry
Hermione
could
stop
him
Ron
had
thrown
the
Invisibility
Cloak
off
himself
and
pelted
away
into
the
darkness
Ron
Hermione
moaned
She
and
Harry
looked
each
other
then
followed
sprint
impossible
run
full
out
under
the
cloak
they
pulled
off
and
streamed
behind
them
like
banner
they
hurtled
after
Ron
they
could
hear
his
feet
thundering
along
ahead
and
his
shouts
Crookshanks
Get
away
from
him
get
away
Scabbers
come
here
There
was
loud
thud
Gotcha
Get
off
you
stinking
cat
Harry
and
Hermione
almost
fell
over
Ron
they
skidded
stop
right
front
him
was
sprawled
the
ground
but
Scabbers
was
back
his
pocket
had
both
hands
held
tight
over
the
quivering
lump
Ron
come
back
under
the
cloak
Hermione
panted
Dumbledore
the
Minister
they
coming
back
out
minute
But
before
they
could
cover
themselves
again
before
they
could
even
catch
their
breath
they
heard
the
soft
pounding
gigantic
paws
Something
was
bounding
toward
them
quiet
shadow
enormous
pale
eyed
jet
black
dog
Harry
reached
for
his
wand
but
too
late
the
dog
had
made
enormous
leap
and
the
front
paws
hit
him
the
chest
keeled
over
backward
whirl
hair
felt
its
hot
breath
saw
inch
long
teeth
But
the
force
its
leap
had
carried
too
far
rolled
off
him
Dazed
feeling
though
his
ribs
were
broken
Harry
tried
stand
could
hear
growling
skidded
around
for
new
attack
Ron
was
his
feet
the
dog
sprang
back
toward
them
pushed
Harry
aside
the
dog
jaws
fastened
instead
around
Ron
outstretched
arm
Harry
lunged
forward
seized
handful
the
brute
hair
but
was
dragging
Ron
away
easily
though
were
rag
doll
Then
out
nowhere
something
hit
Harry
hard
across
the
face
was
knocked
off
his
feet
again
heard
Hermione
shriek
with
pain
and
fall
too
Harry
groped
for
his
wand
blinking
blood
out
his
eyes
Lumos
whispered
The
wandlight
showed
him
the
trunk
thick
tree
they
had
chased
Scabbers
into
the
shadow
the
Whomping
Willow
and
its
branches
were
creaking
though
high
wind
whipping
backward
and
forward
stop
them
going
nearer
And
there
the
base
the
trunk
was
the
dog
dragging
Ron
backward
into
large
gap
the
roots
Ron
was
fighting
furiously
but
his
head
and
torso
were
slipping
out
sight
Ron
Harry
shouted
trying
follow
but
heavy
branch
whipped
lethally
through
the
air
and
was
forced
backward
again
All
they
could
see
now
was
one
Ron
legs
which
had
hooked
around
root
effort
stop
the
dog
from
pulling
him
farther
underground
but
horrible
crack
cut
the
air
like
gunshot
Ron
leg
had
broken
and
moment
later
his
foot
vanished
from
sight
Harry
got
for
help
Hermione
gasped
she
was
bleeding
too
the
Willow
had
cut
her
across
the
shoulder
That
thing
big
enough
eat
him
haven
got
time
Harry
never
going
get
through
without
help
Another
branch
whipped
down
them
twigs
clenched
like
knuckles
that
dog
can
get
can
Harry
panted
darting
here
and
there
trying
find
way
through
the
vicious
swishing
branches
but
couldn
get
inch
nearer
the
tree
roots
without
being
range
the
tree
blows
help
help
Hermione
whispered
frantically
dancing
certainly
the
spot
Please
Crookshanks
darted
forward
slithered
between
the
battering
branches
like
snake
and
placed
his
front
paws
upon
knot
the
trunk
Abruptly
though
the
tree
had
been
turned
marble
stopped
moving
Not
leaf
twitched
shook
Crookshanks
Hermione
whispered
uncertainly
She
now
grasped
Harry
arm
painfully
hard
How
did
know
friends
with
that
dog
said
Harry
grimly
seen
them
together
Come
and
keep
your
wand
out
They
covered
the
distance
the
trunk
seconds
but
before
they
had
reached
the
gap
the
roots
Crookshanks
had
slid
into
with
flick
his
bottlebrush
tail
Harry
went
next
crawled
forward
headfirst
and
slid
down
earthy
slope
the
bottom
very
low
tunnel
Crookshanks
was
little
way
along
his
eyes
flashing
the
light
from
Harry
wand
Seconds
later
Hermione
slithered
down
beside
him
Where
Ron
she
whispered
terrified
voice
This
way
said
Harry
setting
off
bent
backed
after
Crookshanks
Where
does
this
tunnel
come
out
Hermione
asked
breathlessly
from
behind
him
don
know
marked
the
Marauder
Map
but
Fred
and
George
said
one
ever
gotten
into
goes
off
the
edge
the
map
but
looked
like
was
heading
for
Hogsmeade
They
moved
fast
they
could
bent
almost
double
ahead
them
Crookshanks
tail
bobbed
and
out
view
and
went
the
passage
felt
least
long
the
one
Honeydukes
All
Harry
could
think
was
Ron
and
what
the
enormous
dog
might
doing
him
was
drawing
breath
sharp
painful
gasps
running
crouch
And
then
the
tunnel
began
rise
moments
later
twisted
and
Crookshanks
had
gone
instead
Harry
could
see
patch
dim
light
through
small
opening
and
Hermione
paused
gasping
for
breath
edging
forward
Both
raised
their
wands
see
what
lay
beyond
was
room
very
disordered
dusty
room
Paper
was
peeling
from
the
walls
there
were
stains
all
over
the
floor
every
piece
furniture
was
broken
though
somebody
had
smashed
The
windows
were
all
boarded
Harry
glanced
Hermione
who
looked
very
frightened
but
nodded
Harry
pulled
himself
out
the
hole
staring
around
The
room
was
deserted
but
door
their
right
stood
open
leading
shadowy
hallway
Hermione
suddenly
grabbed
Harry
arm
again
Her
wide
eyes
were
traveling
around
the
boarded
windows
Harry
she
whispered
think
the
Shrieking
Shack
Harry
looked
around
His
eyes
fell
wooden
chair
near
them
Large
chunks
had
been
torn
out
one
the
legs
had
been
ripped
off
entirely
Ghosts
didn
that
said
slowly
that
moment
there
was
creak
overhead
Something
had
Moved
upstairs
Both
them
looked
the
ceiling
Hermione
grip
Harry
arm
was
tight
was
losing
feeling
his
fingers
raised
his
eyebrows
her
she
nodded
again
and
let
Quietly
they
could
they
crept
out
into
the
hall
and
the
crumbling
staircase
Everything
was
covered
thick
layer
dust
except
the
floor
where
wide
shiny
stripe
had
been
made
something
being
dragged
upstairs
They
reached
the
dark
landing
Nox
they
whispered
together
and
the
lights
the
end
their
wands
went
out
Only
one
door
was
open
they
crept
toward
they
heard
movement
from
behind
low
moan
and
then
deep
loud
purring
They
exchanged
last
look
last
nod
Wand
held
tightly
before
him
Harry
kicked
the
door
wide
open
magnificent
four
poster
bed
with
dusty
hangings
lay
Crookshanks
purring
loudly
the
sight
them
the
floor
beside
him
clutching
his
leg
which
stuck
out
strange
angle
was
Ron
Harry
and
Hermione
dashed
across
him
Ron
are
you
okay
Where
the
dog
Not
dog
Ron
moaned
His
teeth
were
gritted
with
pain
Harry
trap
What
the
dog
Animagus
Ron
was
staring
over
Harry
shoulder
Harry
wheeled
around
With
snap
the
man
the
shadows
closed
the
door
behind
them
mass
filthy
matted
hair
hung
his
elbows
eyes
hadn
been
shining
out
the
deep
dark
sockets
might
have
been
corpse
The
waxy
skin
was
stretched
tightly
over
the
bones
his
face
looked
like
skull
His
yellow
teeth
were
bared
grin
was
Sirius
Black
Expelliarmus
croaked
pointing
Ron
wand
them
Harry
and
Hermione
wands
shot
out
their
hands
high
the
air
and
Black
caught
them
Then
took
step
closer
His
eyes
were
fixed
Harry
thought
you
come
and
help
your
friend
said
hoarsely
His
voice
sounded
though
had
long
since
lost
the
habit
using
Your
father
would
have
done
the
same
for
Brave
you
not
run
for
teacher
grateful
will
make
everything
much
easier
The
taunt
about
his
father
rang
Harry
ears
though
Black
had
bellowed
boiling
hate
erupted
Harry
chest
leaving
place
for
fear
For
the
first
time
his
life
wanted
his
wand
back
his
hand
not
defend
himself
but
attack
kill
Without
knowing
what
was
doing
started
forward
but
there
was
sudden
movement
either
side
him
and
two
pairs
hands
grabbed
him
and
held
him
back
Harry
Hermione
gasped
petrified
whisper
Ron
however
spoke
Black
you
want
kill
Harry
you
have
kill
too
said
fiercely
though
the
effort
standing
upright
was
draining
him
still
more
color
and
swayed
slightly
spoke
Something
flickered
Black
shadowed
eyes
Lie
down
said
quietly
Ron
You
will
damage
that
leg
even
more
Did
you
hear
Ron
said
weakly
though
was
clinging
painfully
Harry
stay
upright
You
have
kill
all
three
There
only
one
murder
here
tonight
said
Brack
and
his
grin
widened
Why
that
Harry
spat
trying
wrench
himself
free
Ron
and
Hermione
Didn
care
last
time
did
you
Didn
mind
slaughtering
all
those
Muggles
get
Pettigrew
What
the
matter
gone
soft
Azkaban
Harry
Hermione
whimpered
quiet
KILLED
MUM
AND
DAD
Harry
roared
and
with
huge
effort
broke
free
Hermione
and
Ron
restraint
and
lunged
forward
had
forgotten
about
magic
had
forgotten
that
was
short
and
skinny
and
thirteen
whereas
Black
was
tall
full
grown
man
all
Harry
knew
was
that
wanted
hurt
Black
badly
could
and
that
didn
care
how
much
got
hurt
return
Perhaps
was
the
shock
Harry
doing
something
stupid
but
Black
didn
raise
the
wands
time
one
Harry
hands
fastened
over
his
wasted
wrist
forcing
the
wand
tips
away
the
knuckles
Harry
other
hand
collided
with
the
side
Black
head
and
they
fell
backward
into
the
wall
Hermione
was
screaming
Ron
was
yelling
there
was
blinding
flash
the
wands
Black
hand
sent
jet
sparks
into
the
air
that
missed
Harry
face
inches
Harry
felt
the
shrunken
arm
under
his
fingers
twisting
madly
but
clung
his
other
hand
punching
every
part
Black
could
find
But
Black
free
hand
had
found
Harry
throat
hissed
waited
too
long
The
fingers
tightened
Harry
choked
his
glasses
askew
Then
saw
Hermione
foot
swing
out
nowhere
Black
let
Harry
with
grunt
pain
Ron
had
thrown
himself
Black
wand
hand
and
Harry
heard
faint
clatter
fought
free
the
tangle
bodies
and
saw
his
own
wand
rolling
across
the
floor
threw
himself
toward
but
Argh
Crookshanks
had
joined
the
fray
both
sets
front
claws
had
sunk
themselves
deep
into
Harry
arm
Harry
threw
him
off
but
Crookshanks
now
darted
toward
Harry
wand
YOU
DON
roared
Harry
and
aimed
kick
Crookshanks
that
made
the
cat
leap
aside
spitting
Harry
snatched
his
wand
and
turned
Get
out
the
way
shouted
Ron
and
Hermione
They
didn
need
telling
twice
Hermione
gasping
for
breath
her
lip
bleeding
scrambled
aside
snatching
her
and
Ron
wands
Ron
crawled
the
four
poster
and
collapsed
onto
panting
his
white
face
now
tinged
with
green
both
hands
clutching
his
broken
leg
Black
was
sprawled
the
bottom
the
wall
His
thin
chest
rose
and
fell
rapidly
watched
Harry
walking
slowly
nearer
his
wand
pointing
straight
Black
heart
Going
kill
Harry
whispered
Harry
stopped
right
above
him
his
wand
still
pointing
Black
chest
looking
down
him
livid
bruise
was
rising
around
Black
left
eye
and
his
nose
was
bleeding
You
killed
parents
said
Harry
his
voice
shaking
slightly
but
his
wand
hand
quite
steady
Black
stared
him
out
those
sunken
eyes
don
deny
said
very
quietly
But
you
knew
the
whole
story
The
whole
story
Harry
repeated
furious
pounding
his
ears
You
sold
them
Voldemort
That
all
need
know
You
got
listen
Black
said
and
there
was
note
urgency
his
voice
now
You
regret
you
don
You
don
understand
understand
lot
better
than
you
think
said
Harry
and
his
voice
shook
more
than
ever
You
never
heard
her
did
you
mum
trying
stop
Voldemort
killing
and
you
did
that
you
did
Before
either
them
could
say
another
word
something
ginger
streaked
past
Harry
Crookshanks
leapt
onto
Black
chest
and
settled
himself
there
right
over
Black
heart
Black
blinked
and
looked
down
the
cat
Get
off
murmured
trying
push
Crookshanks
off
him
But
Crookshanks
sank
his
claws
into
Black
robes
and
wouldn
shift
turned
his
ugly
squashed
face
Harry
and
looked
him
with
those
great
yellow
eyes
his
right
Hermione
gave
dry
sob
Harry
stared
down
Black
and
Crookshanks
his
grip
tightening
the
wand
what
had
kill
the
cat
too
was
league
with
Black
was
prepared
die
trying
protect
Black
that
wasn
Harry
business
Black
wanted
save
that
only
proved
cared
more
for
Crookshanks
than
for
Harry
parents
Harry
raised
the
wand
Now
was
the
moment
Now
was
the
moment
avenge
his
mother
and
father
was
going
kill
Black
had
kill
Black
This
was
his
chance
The
seconds
lengthened
And
still
Harry
stood
frozen
there
wand
poised
Black
staring
him
Crookshanks
his
chest
Ron
ragged
breathing
came
from
near
the
bed
Hermione
was
quite
silent
And
then
came
new
sound
Muffled
footsteps
were
echoing
through
the
floor
someone
was
moving
downstairs
HERE
Hermione
screamed
suddenly
HERE
SIRIUS
BLACK
QUICK
Black
made
startled
movement
that
almost
dislodged
Crookshanks
Harry
gripped
his
wand
convulsively
now
said
voice
his
head
but
the
footsteps
were
thundering
the
stairs
and
Harry
still
hadn
done
The
door
the
room
burst
open
shower
red
sparks
and
Harry
wheeled
around
Professor
Lupin
came
hurtling
into
the
room
his
face
bloodless
his
wand
raised
and
ready
His
eyes
flickered
over
Ron
lying
the
floor
over
Hermione
cowering
next
the
door
Harry
standing
there
with
his
wand
covering
Black
and
then
Black
himself
crumpled
and
bleeding
Harry
feet
Expelliarmus
Lupin
shouted
Harry
wand
flew
once
more
out
his
hand
did
the
two
Hermione
was
holding
Lupin
caught
them
all
deftly
then
moved
into
the
room
staring
Black
who
still
had
Crookshanks
lying
Protectively
across
his
chest
Harry
stood
there
feeling
suddenly
empty
hadn
done
His
nerve
had
failed
him
Black
was
going
handed
back
the
dementors
Then
Lupin
spoke
very
tense
voice
Where
Sirius
Harry
looked
quickly
Lupin
didn
understannd
what
Lupin
meant
Who
was
Lupin
talking
about
turned
look
Black
again
Black
face
was
quite
expressionless
For
few
seconds
didn
move
all
Then
very
slowly
raised
his
empty
hand
and
pointed
straight
Ron
Mystified
Harry
glanced
around
Ron
who
looked
bewildered
But
then
Lupin
muttered
staring
Black
intently
seemed
was
trying
read
his
mind
why
hasn
shown
himself
before
now
Unless
Lupin
eyes
suddenly
widened
though
was
seeing
something
beyond
Black
something
none
the
rest
could
see
unless
was
the
one
unless
you
switched
without
telling
Very
slowly
his
sunken
gaze
never
leaving
Lupin
face
Black
nodded
Professor
Harry
interrupted
loudly
what
going
But
never
finished
the
question
because
what
saw
made
his
voice
die
his
throat
Lupin
was
lowering
his
wand
gazing
fixed
Black
The
Professor
walked
Black
side
seized
his
hand
pulled
him
his
feet
that
Crookshanks
fell
the
floor
and
embraced
Black
like
brother
Harry
felt
though
the
bottom
had
dropped
out
his
stomach
DON
BELIEVE
Hermione
screamed
Lupin
let
Black
and
turned
her
She
had
raised
herself
off
the
floor
and
was
pointing
Lupin
wild
eyed
You

shouted

Harry
could
feel
himself
shaking
not
with
fear
but
with
fresh
wave
fury

shouted
Lupin
his
voice
wavering
out
control
and
all
the
time

You

Lupin

There
was
ringing
silence
Everyone
eyes
were
now
Lupin
who
looked
remarkably
calm
though
rather
pale
Not
all
your
usual
standard
Hermione
said
Only
one
out

Sirius
get
into
the
castle
and

Harry
dead
odd
shiver
passed
over
his
face
But
won
deny
that
werewolf
Ron
made
valiant
effort
get
again
but
fell
back
with
whimper
pain
Lupin
made
toward
him
looking
concerned
but
Ron
gasped
Get

ftom
werewolf
Lupin
stopped
dead
Then
with
obvious
effort
turned
Hermione
and
said
How
long
have
you
known
Ages
Hermione
whispered
Since
did
Professor
Snape
essay
delighted
said
Lupin
coolly
assigned
that
essay
hoping
someone
would
realize
what
symptoms
meant
Did

the
lunar
chart
and
realize
that

always
ill
the
full
moon

that

boggart

when

Both

Lupin
forced
laugh

certain
teachers
that

WAS
WRONG
Harry
yelled

pointing
Black
who
suddenly
crossed
the
four
poster
bed
and
sank
onto
his
face
hidden
one
shaking
hand
Crookshanks
leapt
beside
him
and
stepped
onto
his
lap
purring
Ron
edged
away
from

dragging
his
leg

not

said
Lupin

Lupin
waving
his

impatiently

for

You
wrote
The
important
thing
was
watching
carefully
this
evening
because
had
idea
that

and
Hermione

try
and

castle

Hagrid
before
his
hippogriff
was
executed
And
was

Little

feet
You

Harry
How

the
cloak
The

Lupin
waving
impatient
hand
again
The
point
even
you
wearing
Invisibility
Cloak
you
still
show
the
Marauder
Map
watched
you
cross
the
grounds
and
enter
Hagrid
hut
Twenty
minutes
later
you
left
Hagrid
and
set
off
back
toward
the
castle
But
you
were
now
accompanied
somebody
else
What

then
put

Scabbers

thrashing
desperately
Ron

Crookshanks

intently

from

snarled
Black
trying
throw
Lupin
off
One
hand
was
still
clawing
the
air
tried
reach
Scabbers
who
was
squealing
like
piglet
scratching
Ron

They

Ron
bitten
scratched
bleeding
hands
All
right
then
Black
said
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
rat
Tell
them
whatever
you
like
But
make
quick
Remus
want
commit
the
murder
was
imprisoned
for
You
nutters
both
you
said
Ron
shakily
looking
round
Harry
and
Hermione
for
support
had
enough
this
off
tried
heave
himself
his
good
leg
but
Lupin
raised
his
wand
again
pointing
Scabbers
You
going
hear
out
Ron
said
quietly
Just
keep
tight
hold
Peter
while
you
listen
NOT
PETER
SCABBERS
Ron
yelled
trying
fore
the
rat
back
into
his
front
pocket
but
Scabbers
was
fighting
hard
Ron
swayed
and
overbalanced
and
Harry
caught
him
pushed
him
back
down
the
bed
Then
ignoring
Black
Harry
turned
Lupin
There
were
witnesses
who
saw
Pettigrew
die
said
whole
street
full
them
They
didn
see
what
they
thought
they
saw
said
Black
savagely
still
watching
Scabbers
struggling
Ron
hands
Everyone
thought
Sirius
killed
Peter
said
Lupin
nodding
believed
myself
until
saw
the
map
tonight
Because
the
Marauder
map
never
lies
Peter
alive
Ron
holding
him
Harry
Harry
looked
down
Ron
and
their
eyes
met
they
agreed
silently
Black
and
Lupin
were
both
out
their
minds
Their
story
made
sense
whatsoever
How
could
Scabbers
Peter
Pettigrew
Azkaban
must
have
unhinged
Black
after
all
but
why
was
Lupin
playing
along
with
him
Then
Hermione
spoke
trembling
would
calm
sort
voice
though
trying
will
Professor
Lupin
talk
sensibly
But
Professor
Lupin
Scabbers
can
Pettigrew
just
can
true
you
know
can
Why
can
true
Lupin
said
calmly
though
they
were
class
and
Hermione
had
simply
spotted
problem
experiment
with
grindylows
Because
because
people
would
know
Peter
Pettigrew
had
been
Animagus
did
Animagi
class
with
Professor
McGonagall
And
looked
them
when
did
homework
the
Ministry
Magic
keeps
tabs
witches
and
wizards
who
can
become
animals
there
register
showing
what
animal
they
become
and
their
markings
and
things
and
went
and
looked
Professor
McGonagall
the
register
and
there
have
been
only
seven
Animagi
this
century
and
Pettigrew
name
wasn
the
list
Harry
had
barely
had
time
marvel
inwardly
the
effort
Hermione
put
into
her
homework
when
Lupin
started
laugh
Light
again
Hermione
said
But
the
Ministry
never
knew
that
here
used
three
unregistered
Animagi
running
around
Hogwarts
you
going
tell
them
the
story
get
move
Remus
said
Black
who
was
still
watching
Scabbers
every
desperate
move
waited
twelve
years
not
going
wait
much
longer
All
right
but
you
need
help
Sirius
said
Lupin
only
know
how
began
Lupin
broke
off
There
had
been
loud
creak
behind
him
The
bedroom
door
had
opened
its
own
accord
All
five
them
stared
Then
Lupin
strode
toward
and
looked
out
into
the
landing
one
there
This
place
haunted
said
Ron
not
said
Lupin
still
looking
the
door
puzzled
way
The
Shrieking
Shack
was
never
haunted
The
screams
and
howls
the
villagers
used
hear
were
made
pushed
his
graying
hair
out
his
eyes
thought
for
moment
then
said
That
where
all
this
starts
with
becoming
werewolf
None
this
could
have
happened
hadn
been
bitter
and
hadn
been
foolhardy
looked
sober
and
tired
Ron
started
interrupt
but
Hermione
said
Shh
She
was
watching
Lupin
very
intently
very
small
boy
when
received
the
bite
parents
tried
everything
but
those
days
there
was
cure
The
potion
that
Professor
Snape
has
been
making
for
very
recent
discovery
makes
safe
you
see
long
take
the
week
preceding
the
full
moon
keep
mind
when
transform
able
curl
office
harmless
wolf
and
wait
for
the
moon
wane
again
Before
the
Wolfsbane
Potion
was
discovered
however
became
fully
fledged
monster
once
month
seemed
impossible
that
would
able
come
Hogwarts
Other
parents
weren
likely
want
their
children
exposed
But
then
Dumbledore
became
Headmaster
and
was
sympathetic
said
that
long
took
certain
precautions
there
was
reason
shouldn
come
school
Lupin
sighed
and
looked
directly
Harry
told
you
months
ago
that
the
Whomping
Willow
was
planted
the
year
came
Hogwarts
The
truth
that
was
planted
because
came
Hogwarts
This
house
Lupin
looked
miserably
around
the
room
the
tunnel
that
leads
they
were
built
for
use
Once
month
was
smuggled
out
the
castle
into
this
place
transform
The
tree
was
placed
the
tunnel
mouth
stop
anyone
coming
across
while
was
dangerous
Harry
couldn
see
where
this
story
was
going
but
was
listening
raptly
all
the
same
The
only
sound
apart
from
Lupin
voice
was
Scabbers
frightened
squeaking
transformations
those
days
were
were
terrible
very
painful
turn
into
werewolf
was
separated
from
humans
bite
bit
and
scratched
myself
instead
The
villagers
heard
the
noise
and
the
screaming
and
thought
they
were
hearing
particularly
violent
spirits
Dumbledore
encouraged
the
rumor
Even
now
when
the
house
has
been
silent
for
years
the
villagers
don
dare
approach
But
apart
from
transformations
was
happier
than
had
ever
been
life
For
the
first
time
ever
had
friends
three
great
friends
Sirius
Black
Peter
Pettigrew
and
course
your
father
Harry
James
Potter
Now
three
friends
could
hardly
fail
notice
that
disappeared
once
month
made
all
sorts
stories
told
them
mother
was
ill
and
that
had
home
see
her
was
terrified
they
would
desert
the
moment
they
found
out
what
was
But
course
they
like
you
Hermione
worked
out
the
truth
And
they
didn
desert
all
Instead
they
did
something
for
that
would
make
transformations
not
only
bearable
but
the
best
times
life
They
became
Animagi
dad
too
said
Harry
astounded
Yes
indeed
said
Lupin
took
them
the
best
part
three
years
work
out
how
Your
father
and
Sirius
here
were
the
cleverest
students
the
school
and
lucky
they
were
because
the
Animagus
transformation
can
horribly
wrong
one
reason
the
Ministry
keeps
close
watch
those
attempting
Peter
needed
all
the
help
could
get
from
James
and
Sirius
Finally
our
fifth
year
they
managed
They
could
each
turn
into
different
animal
will
But
how
did
that
help
you
said
Hermione
sounding
puzzled
They
couldn
keep
company
humans
they
kept
company
animals
said
Lupin
werewolf
only
danger
people
They
sneaked
out
the
castle
every
month
under
James
Invisibility
Cloak
They
transformed
Peter
the
smallest
could
slip
beneath
the
Willow
attacking
branches
and
touch
the
knot
that
freezes
They
would
then
slip
down
the
tunnel
and
join
Under
their
influence
became
less
dangerous
body
was
still
wolfish
but
mind
seemed
become
less
while
was
with
them
Hurry
Remus
snarled
Black
who
was
still
watching
Scabbers
with
horrible
sort
hunger
his
face
getting
there
Sirius
getting
there
well
highly
exciting
possibilities
were
open
now
that
could
all
transform
Soon
were
leaving
the
Shrieking
Shack
and
roaming
the
school
grounds
and
the
village
night
Sirius
and
James
transformed
into
such
large
animals
they
were
able
keep
werewolf
check
doubt
whether
any
Hogwarts
students
ever
found
out
more
about
the
Hogwarts
grounds
and
Hogsmeade
than
did
And
that
how
came
write
the
Marauder
Map
and
sign
with
our
nicknames
Sirius
Padfoot
Peter
Wormtail
James
was
Prongs
What
sort
animal
Harry
began
but
Hermione
cut
him
off
That
was
still
really
dangerous
Running
around
the
dark
with
werewolf
What
you
given
the
others
the
slip
and
bitten
somebody
thought
that
still
haunts
said
Lupin
heavily
And
there
were
near
misses
many
them
laughed
about
them
afterwards
were
young
thoughtless
carried
away
with
our
own
cleverness
sometimes
felt
guilty
about
betraying
Dumbledore
trust
course
had
admitted
Hogwarts
when
other
headmaster
would
have
done
and
had
idea
was
breaking
the
rules
had
set
down
for
own
and
others
safety
never
knew
had
led
three
fellow
students
into
becoming
Animagi
illegally
But
always
managed
forget
guilty
feelings
every
time
sat
down
plan
our
next
month
adventure
And
haven
changed
Lupin
face
had
hardened
and
there
was
self
disgust
his
voice
All
this
year
have
been
battling
with
myself
wondering
whether
should
tell
Dumbledore
that
Sirius
was
Animagus
But
didn
Why
Because
was
too
cowardly
would
have
meant
admitting
that
betrayed
his
trust
while
was
school
admitting
that
led
others
along
with
and
Dumbledore
trust
has
meant
everything
let
into
Hogwarts
boy
and
gave
job
when
have
been
shunned
all
adult
life
unable
find
paid
work
because
what
And
convinced
myself
that
Sirius
was
getting
into
the
school
using
dark
arts
learned
from
Voldemort
that
being
Animagus
had
nothing
with
way
Snape
been
right
about
all
along
Snape
said
Black
harshly
taking
his
eyes
off
Scabbers
for
the
first
time
minutes
and
looking

Sneaking
around
trying

Severus
was
very
interested
where

every
month
Lupin
told
Harry

Snape
had

grounds
with
Madam
Pomfrey
one
evening

and
pulled
him
back

risk
his
life
Snape
glimpsed
though
the
end
the
tunnel
was
forbidden
Dumbledore
tell
anybody
but
from
that
time
knew
what
was
that
why
Snape
doesn

Harry
slowly
because

joke
That

Snape
was
slightly

Thin

and
twisted
themselves
around
Lupin
mouth
wrists
and
ankles
overbalanced
and
fell
the
floor
unable
move
With
roar
rage
Black
started
toward
Snape
but
Snape
pointed
his
wand
straight
between
Black
eyes
Give
reason
whispered
Give
reason
and
swear
will
Black
stopped
dead
would
have
been
impossible
say
which
face
showed
more
hatred
Harry
stood
there
paralyzed
not
knowing
what
whom
believe
glanced
around
Ron
and
Hermione
Ron
looked
just
confused
did
still
fighting
keep
hold
the
struggling
Scabbers
Hermione
however
took
uncertain
step
toward
Snape
and
said
very
breathless
voice
Professor
Snape
wouldn
hurt
hear
what
they
got
say
would
Miss

shouted
looking
suddenly
quite
deranged

few
sparks
shot
out

end
his
wand
which
was
still
pointed
Black

Hermione
fell
silent
Vengeance
very
sweet
Snape
breathed
Black
How

Severus
Black
snarled

They

But
there

beyond
reason
Come

said
clicked
his
fingers
and
the
ends
the
cords
that
bound
Lupin
flew
his
hands
drag
the
werewolf
Perhaps
the
dementors
will
have
kiss
for
him
too
Before
knew
what
was
doing
Harry
had
crossed
the
room
three
strides
and
blocked
the
door
Get

Snape

Harry
made
his
mind
split
second
Before
Snape
could
take
even
one
step
toward
him
had
raised
his
wand
Expelliarmus
yelled
except
that
his
wasn
the
only
voice
that
shouted
There
was
blast
that
made
the
door
rattle
its
hinges
Snape
was
lifted
off
his
feet
and
slammed
into
the
wall
then
slid
down
the
floor
trickle
blood
oozing
from
under
his
hair
had
been
knocked
out
Harry
looked
around
Both
Ron
and
Hermione
had
tried
disarm
Snape
exactly
the
same
moment
Snape
wand
soared
high
arc
and
landed
the
bed
next
Crookshanks
You
shouldn
have
done
that
said
Black
looking
Harry
You
should
have
left
him
Harry
avoided
Black
eyes
wasn
sure
even
now
that
done
the
right
thing
attacked
teacher

Hermione
whimpered
staring
the
lifeless
Snape
with
frightened
eyes
going
much
trouble
Lupin
was
struggling
against
his
bonds
Black
bent
down
quickly
and
untied
him
Lupin
straightened
rubbing
his
arms
where
the
ropes
had
cut
into
them
Thank
you
Harry
said
still
not
saying
believe
you
told
Lupin
Then
time
offered
you
some
proof
said
Lupin
You

Now
Ron
clutched
Scabbers
closer

chest
Come

said
weakly

Okay

You

that
fair
question
said
Lupin
turning
Black
and
frowning
slightly
How

find
out
where

Black
put
one
his
clawlike
hands
inside
his
robes
and
took
out
crumpled
piece
paper
which
smoothed
flat
and
held
out
show
the
others
was
the
photograph
Ron
and
his
family

previous
summer

asked
Black

Black

Lupin
breathed
simple
brilliant
cut
off
himself
Just
before
transformed
said
Black
When
cornered
him
yelled
for
the
whole
street
hear
that
betrayed
Lily
and
James
Then
before
could
curse
him
blew
apart
the
street
with
the
wand
behind
his
back
killed
everyone
within
twenty
feet
himself
and
sped
down
into
the
sewer
with
the
other
rats
Didn
you
ever
hear
Ron
said
Lupin
The
biggest
bit
Peter
they
found
was
his
finger
Look
Scabbers
probably
had
fight
with
another
rat
something
been

for
ages
right
Twelve
years
fact
said
Lupin
Didn
you
ever
wonder
why
was
living
long
been
taking
good
care
him
said
Ron
Not
looking
too
good
the
moment
though
said
Lupin
guess
been
losing
weight
ever
since
heard
Sirius
was
the
loose
again
been
scared
that
mad
cat
said
Ron
nodding
toward
Crookshanks
who
was
still
purring
the
bed
But
that
wasn
right
Harry
thought
suddenly
Scabbers
had
been
looking
ill
before
met
Crookshanks
ever
since
Ron
return
from
Egypt
since
the
time
when
Black
had
escaped
This
cat
isn
mad
said
Black
hoarsely
reached
out
bony
hand
and
stroked
Crookshanks
fluffy
head
the
most
intelligent
his
kind
ever
met
recognized
Peter
for
what
was
right
away
And
when
met
knew
was
dog
was
while
before
trusted
Finally
managed
communicate
him
what
was
after
and
been
helping
What
you
mean
breathed
Hermione
tried
bring
Peter
but
couldn
stole
the
passwords
into
Gryffindor
Tower
for
understand
took
them
from
boy
bedside
table
Harry
brain
seemed
sagging
under
the
weight
what
was
hearing
was
absurd
and
yet
But
Peter
got
wind
what
was
going
and
ran
for
croaked
Black
This
cat
Crookshanks
did
you
call
him
told
Peter
had
left
blood
the
sheets
supposed
bit
himself
Well
faking
his
own
death
had
worked
once
These
words
jolted
Harry
his
senses
And
why
did
fake
his
death
said
furiously
Because
knew
you
were
about
kill
him
like
you
killed
parents
said
Lupin
Harry
And
now
you
come
finish
him
off
Yes
have
said
Black
with
evil
look
Scabbers
Then
should
let
Snape
take
you
Harry
shouted
Harry
said
Lupin
hurriedly
don
you
see
All
this
time
thought
Sirius
betrayed
your
parents
and
Peter
tracked
him
down
but
was
the
other
way
around
don
you
see
Peter
betrayed
your
mother
and
father
Sirius
tracked
Peter
down
THAT
NOT
TRUE
Harry
yelled
WAS
THEIR
SECRET
KEEPER
SAID
BEFORE
YOU
TURNED
SAID
KILLED
THEM
was
pointing
Black
who
shook
his
head
slowly
the
sunken
eyes
were
suddenly
over
bright
Harry
good
killed
them
croaked
persuaded
Lily
and
James
change
Peter
the
last
moment
persuaded
them
use
him
Secret
Keeper
instead
blame

The
night
they
died
arranged
check
Peter
make
sure
was
still
safe
but
when
arrived
his
hiding
place
gone
Yet
there
was
sign
struggle
didn
feel
right
was
scared
set
out
for
your
parents
house
straight
away
And
when
saw
their
house
destroyed
and
their
bodies
realized
what
Peter
must
done
what
done
His
voice
broke
turned
away
Enough
this
said
Lupin
and
there
was
steely
note
his
voice
Harry
had
never
heard
before
There
one
certain
way
prove
what
really
happened
Ron
give
that
rat
What
are
you
going
with
him
give
him
you
Ron
asked
Lupin
tensely
Force
him
show
himself
said
Lupin
really
rat
won
hurt
him
Ron
hesitated
Then
long
last
held
out
Scabbers
and
Lupin
took
him
Scabbers
began
squeak
without
stopping
twisting
and
turning
his
tiny
black
eyes
bulging
his
head
Ready
Sirius
said
Lupin
Black
had
already
retrieved
Snape
wand
from
the
bed
approached
Lupin
and
the
struggling
rat
and
his
wet
eyes
suddenly
seemed
burning
his
face
Together
said
quietly
think
said
Lupin
holding
Scabbers
tightly
one
hand
and
his
wand
the
other
the
count
three
One
two
THREE
flash
blue
white
light
erupted
from
both
wands
for
moment
Scabbers
was
frozen
midair
his
small
gray
form
twisting
madly
Ron
yelled
the
rat
fell
and
hit
the
floor
There
was
another
blinding
flash
light
and
then
was
like
watching
speeded
film
growing
tree
head
was
shooting
upward
from
the
ground
limbs
were
sprouting
moment
later
man
was
standing
where
Scabbers
had
been
cringing
and
wringing
his
hands
Crookshanks
was
spitting
and
snarling
the
bed
the
hair
his
back
was
standing
was
very
short
man
hardly
taller
than
Harry
and
Hermione
His
thin
colorless
hair
was
unkempt
and
there
was
large
bald
patch
top
had
the
shrunken
appearance
plump
man
who
has
lost
lot
weight
short
time
His
skin
looked
grubby
almost
like
Scabbers
fur
and
something
the
rat
lingered
around
his
pointed
nose
and
his
very
small
watery
eyes
looked
around
them
all
his
breathing
fast
and
shallow
Harry
saw
his
eyes
dart
the
door
and
back
again
Well
hello
Peter
said
Lupin
pleasantly
though
rats
frequently
erupted
into
old
school
friends
around
him
Long
time
see
Sirius
Remus
Even
Pettigrew
voice
was
squeaky
Again
his
eyes
darted
toward
the
door
friends
old
friends
Black
wand
arm
rose
but
Lupin
seized
him
around
the
wrist
gave
him
warning
took
then
turned
again
Pettigrew
his
voice
light
and
casual
been
having
little
chat
Peter
about
what
happened
the
night
Lily
and
James
died
You
might
have
missed
the
finer
points
while
you
were
squeaking
around
down
there
the
bed
Remus
gasped
Pettigrew
and
Harry
could
see
beads
sweat
breaking
out
over
his
pasty
face
you
don
believe
him
you
tried
kill
Remus
heard
said
Lupin
more
coldly
like
clear
one
two
little
matters
with
you
Peter
you
come
try
and
kill
again
Pettigrew
squeaked
suddenly
pointing
Black
and
Harry
saw
that
used
his
middle
finger
because
his
index
was
missing
killed
Lily
and
James
and
now
going
kill
too
You
got
help
Remus
Black
face
looked
more
skull
like
than
ever
stared
Pettigrew
with
his
fathomless
eyes
one
going
try
and
kill
you
until
sorted
few
things
out
said
Lupin
Sorted
things
out
squealed
Pettigrew
looking
wildly
about
him
once
more
eyes
taking
the
boarded
windows
and
again
the
only
door
knew
come
after
knew
back
for
been
waiting
for
this
for
twelve
years
You
knew
Sirius
was
going
break
out
Azkaban
said
Lupin
his
brow
furrowed
When
nobody
has
ever
done
before
got
dark
powers
the
rest
can
only
dream
Pettigrew
shouted
shrilly
How
else
did
get
out
there
suppose
Who
Must
Not
Named
taught
him
few
tricks
Black
started
laugh
horrible
mirthless
laugh
that
filled
the
whole
room
Voldemort
teach
tricks
said
Pettigrew
flinched
though
Black
had
brandished
whip
him
What
scared
hear
your
old
master
name
said
Black
don
blame
you
Peter
His
lot
aren
very
happy
with
you
are
they
Don
know
what
you
mean
Sirius
muttered
Pettigrew
his
breathing
faster
than
ever
His
whole
face
was
shining
with
sweat
now
You
haven
been
hiding
from
for
twelve
years
said
Black
You
been
hiding
from
Voldemort
old
supporters
heard
things
Azkaban
Peter
They
all
think
you
dead
you
have
answer
them
heard
them
screaming
all
sorts
things
their
sleep
Sounds
like
they
think
the
double
crosser
double
crossed
them
Voldemort
went
the
Potters
your
information
and
Voldemort
met
his
downfall
there
And
not
all
Voldemort
supporters
ended
Azkaban
did
they
There
are
still
plenty
out
here
biding
their
time
pretending
they
seen
the
error
their
ways
they
ever
got
wind
that
you
were
still
alive
Peter
Don
know
what
you
talking
about
said
Pettigrew
again
more
shrilly
than
ever
wiped
his
face
his
sleeve
and
looked
Lupin
You
don
believe
this
this
madness
Remus
must
admit
Peter
have
difficulty
understanding
why
innocent
man
would
want
spend
twelve
years
rat
said
Lupin
evenly
Innocent
but
scared
squealed
Pettigrew
Voldemort
supporters
were
after
was
because
put
one
their
best
men
Azkaban
the
spy
Sirius
Black
Black
face
contorted
How
dare
you
growled
sounding
suddenly
like
the
bearsized
dog
had
been
spy
for
Voldemort
When
did
ever
sneak
around
people
who
were
stronger
and
more
powerful
than
myself
But
you
Peter
never
understand
why
didn
see
you
were
the
spy
from
the
start
You
always
liked
big
friends
who
look
after
you
didn
you
used
and
Remus
and
James
Pettigrew
wiped
his
face
again
was
almost
panting
for
breath
spy
must
out
your
mind
never
don
know
how
you
can
say
such
Lily
and
James
only
made
you
Secret
Keeper
because
suggested
Black
hissed
venomously
that
Pettigrew
took
step
backward
thought
was
the
perfect
plan
bluff
Voldemort
would
sure
come
after
would
never
dream
they
use
weak
talentless
thing
like
you
must
have
been
the
finest
moment
your
miserable
life
telling
Voldemort
you
could
hand
him
the
Potters
Pettigrew
was
muttering
distractedly
Harry
caught
words
like
far
fetched
and
lunacy
but
couldn
help
paying
more
attention
the
ashen
color
Pettigrew
face
and
the
way
his
eyes
continued
dart
toward
the
windows
and
door
Professor
Lupin
said
Hermione
timidly
Can
can
say
something
Certainly
Hermione
said
Lupin
courteously
Well
Scabbers
mean
this
this
man
been
sleeping
Harry
dormitory
for
three
years
working
for
You
Know
Who
how
come
never
tried
hurt
Harry
before
now
There
said
Pettigrew
shrilly
pointing
Ron
with
his
maimed
hand
Thank
you
You
see
Remus
have
never
hurt
hair
Harry
head
Why
should
tell
you
why
said
Black
Because
you
never
did
anything
for
anyone
unless
you
could
see
what
was
for
you
Voldemort
been
hiding
for
fifteen
years
they
say
half
dead
You
weren
about
commit
murder
right
under
Albus
Dumbledore
nose
for
wreck
wizard
who
lost
all
his
power
were
you
You
want
quite
sure
was
the
biggest
bully
the
playground
before
you
went
back
him
wouldn
you
Why
else
did
you
find
wizard
family
take
you
Keeping
ear
out
for
news
weren
YOU
Peter
Just
case
your
old
protector
regained
strength
and
was
safe
rejoin
him
Pettigrew
opened
his
mouth
and
closed
several
times
seemed
have
lost
the
ability
talk
Black
Sirius
said
Hermione
Black
jumped
being
addressed
like
this
and
stared
Hermione
though
had
never
seen
anything
quite
like
her
you
don
mind
asking
how
how
did
you
get
out
Azkaban
you
didn
use
Dark
Magic
Thank
you
gasped
Pettigrew
nodding
frantically
her
Exactly
Precisely
what
But
Lupin
silenced
him
with
look
Black
was
frowning
slightly
Hermione
but
not
though
were
annoyed
with
her
seemed
pondering
his
answer
don
know
how
did
said
slowly
think
the
only
reason
never
lost
mind
that
knew
was
innocent
That
wasn
happy
thought
the
dementors
couldn
suck
out
but
kept
sane
and
knowing
who
helped
keep
powers
when
all
became
too
much
could
transform
cell
become
dog
Dementors
can
see
you
know
swallowed
They
feel
their
way
toward
people
feeding
off
their
emotions
They
could
tell
that
feelings
were
less
less
human
less
complex
when
was
dog
but
they
thought
course
that
was
losing
mind
like
everyone
else
there
didn
trouble
them
But
was
weak
very
weak
and
had
hope
driving
them
away
from
without
wand
But
then
saw
Peter
that
picture
realized
was
Hogwarts
with
Harry
perfectly
positioned
act
one
hint
reached
his
ears
that
the
Dark
Side
was
gathering
strength
again
Pettigrew
was
shaking
his
head
mouthing
noiselessly
but
staring
all
the
while
Black
though
hypnotized
ready
strike
the
moment
could
sure
allies
and
deliver
the
last
Potter
them
gave
them
Harry
who
dare
say
betrayed
Lord
Voldemort
welcomed
back
with
honors
you
see
had
something
was
the
only
one
who
knew
Peter
was
still
alive
Harry
remembered
what
Weasley
had
told
Mrs
Wealsey
The
guards
say
been
talking
his
sleep
always
the
same
words
Hogwarts
was
someone
had
lit
fire
head
and
the
dementors
couldn
destroy
wasn
happy
feeling
was
obsession
but
gave

one
night
when
they
opened

and
Lily

them
And
long
last
Harry
believed

Throat
too
tight

nodded
Pettigrew
had
fallen
his
knees
though
Harry
nod
had
been
his
own
death
sentence
shuffled
forward
his
knees
groveling
his
hands
clasped

him
though
praying
Sirius
Peter

Black
kicked

and
Pettigrew
recoiled
There

said
Black
Remus
Pettigrew
squeaked
turning
Lupin
instead
writhing
imploringly
front
him
You
don
believe
this
wouldn
Sirius
have
told
you
they
changed
the
plan
Not

Peter
said
Lupin

casually
over
Pettigrews
head
Forgive

said
Black
Not

Padfoot

friend
said
Lupin
who
was
now
rolling
his
sleeves
And
will
you
turn
forgive
for
believing
you
were
the
spy
course
said
Black
and
the
ghost
grin
flitted
across
his
gaunt
face
too
began
rolling
his
sleeves
Shall
kill
him
together
Yes
think
said
Lupin
grimly
You
wouldn
you
won
gasped
Pettigrew
And
scrambled
around
Ron

You

Kind

Pettigrew
crawled
toward
Ron
You

said
Black
harshly
Ron
going
still
paler
with
pain
wrenched
his
broken
leg
out
Pettigrew
reach
Pettigrew
turned
his
knees
staggered
forward
and
seized
the
hem
Hermione
robes
Sweet

won
let
them
Help
Hermione
pulled
her
robes
out
Pettigrew
clutching
hands
and
backed
away
against
the
wall
looking
horrified
Pettigrew
knelt
trembling
uncontrollably
and
turned
his
head
slowly
toward
Harry
Harry
Harry
you
look
just
like
your
father
just
like
him
HOW

Black

Harry
whispered
Pettigrew
shuffling
toward
him
hands
outstretched
Harry
James
wouldn
have
wanted
killed
James
would
have
understood
Harry
would
have
shown
mercy
Both
Black
and
Lupin
strode
forward
seized
Pettigrew
shoulders
and
threw
him
backward
onto
the
floor
sat
there
twitching
with
terror
staring
them
You

Black

Pettigrew

his
face

Peter
Hermione
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
turned

wall
Harry
yelled

forward
placing
himself
front
Pettigrew
facing
the
wands
You

breathlessly
You

and

around

Get

Harry
spat
throwing
Pettigrew
hands
off
him
disgust

for

because

reckon

wanted
them

killers
just
for
you
one
moved
made
sound
except
Pettigrew
whose
breath
was
coming
wheezes
clutched
his
chest
Black
and
Lupin
were
looking
each
other
Then
with
one
movement
they
lowered
their
wands
You
the
only
person
who
has
the
right
decide
Harry
said
Black
But
think

Harry
repeated

Pettigrew
was
still
wheezing
behind
him
Very
well
said
Lupin
Stand
aside
Harry
Harry
hesitated
going
tie
him
said
Lupin
That
all
swear
Harry
stepped
out
the
way
Thin
cords
shot
from
Lupin
wand
this
time
and
next
moment
Pettigrew
was
wriggling
the
floor
bound
and
gagged
But
you
transform
Peter
growled
Black
his
own
wand
pointing
Pettigrew
too
will
kill
you
You
agree
Harry
Harry
looked
down
the
pitiful
figure
the
floor
and
nodded
that
Pettigrew
could
see
him
Right
said
Lupin
suddenly
businesslike
Ron

mend
bones
nearly
well
Madam
Pomfrey

best
just
strap
your
leg
until

hurried
over
Ron
bent
down
tapped
Ron
leg
with
his
wand
and
muttered
Ferula
Bandages
spun
Ron
leg
strapping
tightly
splint
Lupin
helped
him
his
feet
Ron
put
his
weight
gingerly
the
leg
and
didn
wince
That
better
said
Thanks
What
about
Professor
Snape
said
Hermione
small
voice
looking
down
Snape
prone
figure
There
nothing
seriously
wrong
with
him
said
Lupin
bending
over
Snape
and
checking
his
pulse
You
were
just
little
overenthusiastic
Still
out
cold
perhaps
will
best
don
revive
him
until
safety
back
the
castle
can
take
him
like
this
muttered
Mobilicorpus
though
invisible
strings
were
tied
Snape
wrists
neck
and
knees
was
pulled
into
standing
position
head
still
lolling
unpleasantly
like
grotesque
puppet
hung
few
inches
above
the
ground
his
limp
feet
dangling
Lupin
picked
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
tucked
safely
into
his
pocket
And
two
should
chained
this
said
Black
nudging
Pettigrew
with
his
toe
Just
make
sure
said
Lupin
And
said
Ron
savagely
limping
forward
Black
conjured
heavy
manacles
from
thin
air
soon
Pettigrew
was
upright
again
left
arm
chained
Lupin
right
right
arm
Ron
left
Ron
face
was
set
seemed
have
taken
Scabbers
true
identity
personal
insult
Crookshanks
leapt
lightly
off
the
bed
and
led
the
way
out
the
room
his
bottlebrush
tail
held
jauntily
high
CHAPTER
TWENTY
THE
DEMENTOR
KISS
Harry
had
never
been
part
stranger
group
Crookshanks
led
the
way
down
the
stairs
Lupin
Pettigrew
and
Ron
went
next
looking
like
entrants
six
legged
race
Next
came
Professor
Snape
drifting
creepily
along
his
toes
hitting
each
stair
they
descended
held
his
own
wand
which
was
being
pointed
him
Sirius
Harry
and
Hermione
brought
the
rear
Getting
back
into
the
tunnel
was
difficult
Lupin
Pettigrew
and
Ron
had
turn
sideways
manage
Lupin
still
had
Pettigrew
covered
with
his
wand
Harry
could
see
them
edging
awkwardly
along
the
tunnel
single
file
Crookshanks
was
still
the
lead
Harry
went
right
after
Black
who
was
still
making
Snape
drift
along
ahead
them
kept
bumping
his
lolling
head
the
low
ceiling
Harry
had
the
impression
Black
was
making
effort
prevent
this
You
know
what
this
means
Black
said
abruptly
Harry
they
made
their
slow
progress
along
the
tunnel
Turning
Pettigrew
You
free
said
Harry
Yes
said
Black
But
also
don
know
anyone
ever
told
you
your
godfather
Yeah
knew
that
said
Harry
Well
your
parents
appointed
your
guardian
said
Black
stiffly
anything
happened
them
Harry
waited
Did
Black
mean
what
thought
meant
understand
course
you
want
stay
with
your
aunt
and
uncle
said
Black
But
well
think
about
Once
name
cleared
you
wanted
different
home
Some
sort
explosion
took
place
the
pit
Harry
stomach
What
live
with
you
said
accidentally
cracking
his
head
bit
rock
protruding
from
the
ceiling
Leave
the
Dursleys
course
thought
you
wouldn
want
said
Black
quickly
understand
just
thought
Are
you
insane
said
Harry
his
voice
easily
croaky
Black
course
want
leave
the
Dursleys
Have
you
got
house
When
can
move
Black
turned
right
around
look
him
Snape
head
was
scraping
the
ceiling
but
Black
didn
seem
care
You
want
said
You
mean
Yeah
mean
said
Harry
Black
gaunt
face
broke
into
the
first
true
smile
Harry
had
seen
upon
The
difference
made
was
startling
though
person
ten
years
younger
were
shining
through
the
starved
mask
for
moment
was
recognizable
the
man
who
had
laughed
Harry
parents
wedding
They
did
not
speak
again
until
they
had
reached
the
end
the
tunnel
Crookshanks
darted
first
had
evidently
pressed
his
paw
the
knot
the
trunk
because
Lupin
Pettigrew
and
Ron
clambered
upward
without
any
sound
savaging
branches
Black
saw
Snape
through
the
hole
then
stood
back
for
Harry
and
Hermione
pass
last
all
them
were
out
The
grounds
were
very
dark
now
the
only
light
came
from
the
distant
windows
the
castle
Without
word
they
set
off
Pettigrew
was
still
wheezing
and
occasionally
whimpering
Harry
mind
was
buzzing
was
going
leave
the
Dursleys
was
going
live
with
Sirius
Black
his
parents
best
friend
felt
dazed
What
would
happen
when
told
the
Dursleys
was
going
live
with
the
convict
they
seen
television
One
wrong
move
Peter
said
Lupin
threateningly
ahead
His
wand
was
still
pointed
sideways
Pettigrew
chest
Silently
they
tramped
through
the
grounds
the
castle
lights
growing
slowly
larger
Snape
was
still
drifting
weirdly
ahead
Black
his
chin
bumping
his
chest
And
then
cloud
shifted
There
were
suddenly
dim
shadows
the
ground
Their
party
was
bathed
moonlight
Snape
collided
with
Lupin
Pettigrew
and
Ron
who
had
stopped
abruptly
Black
froze
flung
out
one
arm
make
Harry
and
Hermione
stop
Harry
could
see
Lupin
silhouette
had
gone
rigid
Then
his
limbs
began
shake
Hermione
gasped
didn
take
his
potion
tonight
not
safe
Run
Black
whispered
Run
Now
But
Harry
couldn
run
Ron
was
chained
Pettigrew
and
Lupin
leapt
forward
but
Black
caught
him
around
the
chest
and
threw
him
back
Leave
RUN
There
was
terrible
snarling
noise
Lupin
head
was
lengthening
was
his
body
His
shoulders
were
hunching
Hair
was
sprouting
visibly
his
face
and
hands
which
were
curling
into
clawed
paws
Crookshanks
hair
was
end
again
was
backing
away
the
werewolf
reared
snapping
its
long
jaws
Sirius
disappeared
from
Harry
side
had
transformed
The
enormous
bearlike
dog
bounded
forward
the
werewolf
wrenched
itself
free
the
manacle
binding
the
dog
seized
about
the
neck
and
pulled
backward
away
from
Ron
and
Pettigrew
They
were
locked
jaw
jaw
claws
ripping
each
other
Harry
stood
transfixed
the
sight
too
intent
upon
the
battle
notice
anything
else
was
Hermione
scream
that
alerted
him
Pettigrew
had
dived
for
Lupin
dropped
wand
Ron
unsteady
his
bandaged
leg
fell
There
was
bang
burst
light
and
Ron
lay
motionless
the
ground
Another
bang
Crookshanks
flew
into
the
air
and
back
the
earth
heap
Expelliarmus
Harry
yelled
pointing
his
own
wand
Pettigrew
Lupin
wand
flew
high
into
the
air
and
out
sight
Stay
where
you
are
Harry
shouted
running
forward
Too
late
Pettigrew
had
transformed
Harry
saw
his
bald
tail
whip
through
the
manacle
Ron
outstretched
arm
and
heard
scurrying
through
the
grass
There
was
howl
and
rumbling
growl
Harry
turned
see
the
werewolf
taking
flight
was
galloping
into
the
forest
Sirius
gone
Pettigrew
transformed
Harry
yelled
Black
was
bleeding
there
were
gashes
across
his
muzzle
and
back
but
Harry
words
scrambled
again
and
instant
the
sound
his
paws
faded
silence
pounded
away
across
the
grounds
Harry
and
Hermione
dashed
over
Ron
What
did
him
Hermione
whispered
Ron
eyes
were
only
half
closed
his
mouth
hung
open
was
definitely
alive
they
could
hear
him
breathing
but
didn
seem
recognize
them
don
know
Harry
looked
desperately
around
Black
and
Lupin
both
gone
they
had
one
but
Snape
for
company
still
hanging
unconscious
midair
better
get
them
the
castle
and
tell
someone
said
Harry
pushing
his
hair
out
his
eyes
trying
think
straight
Come
But
then
from
beyond
the
range
their
vision
they
heard
yelping
whining
dog
pain
Sirius
Harry
muttered
staring
into
the
darkness
had
moment
indecision
but
there
was
nothing
they
could
for
Ron
the
moment
and
the
sound
Black
was
trouble
Harry
set
off
run
Hermione
right
behind
him
The
yelping
seemed
coming
from
the
ground
near
the
edge
the
lake
They
pelted
toward
and
Harry
running
flat
out
felt
the
cold
without
realizing
what
must
mean
The
yelping
stopped
abruptly
they
reached
the
lakeshore
they
saw
why
Sirius
had
turned
back
into
man
was
crouched
all
fours
his
hands
over
his
head
Nooo
moaned
Nooo
please
And
then
Harry
saw
them
Dementors
least
hundred
them
gliding
black
mass
around
the
lake
toward
them
spun
around
the
familiar
icy
cold
penetrating
his
insides
fog
starting
obscure
his
vision
more
were
appearing
out
the
darkness
every
side
they
were
encircling
them
Herrnione
think
something
happy
Harry
yelled
raising
his
wand
blinking
furiously
try
and
clear
his
vision
shaking
his
head
rid
the
faint
screaming
that
had
started
inside
going
live
with
godfather
leaving
the
Dursleys
forced
himself
think
Black
and
only
Black
and
began
chant
Expecto
patronum
Expecto
patronum
Black
gave
shudder
rolled
over
and
lay
motionless
the
ground
pale
death
all
right
going
and
live
with
him
Expecto
patronum
Hermione
help
Expecto
patronum
Expecto
Hermione
whispered
expecto
expecto
But
she
couldn
The
dementors
were
closing
barely
ten
feet
from
them
They
formed
solid
wall
around
Harry
and
Hermione
and
were
getting
closer
EXPECTO
PATRONUM
Harry
yelled
trying
blot
the
screaming
from
his
ears
EXPECTO
PATRONUM
thin
wisp
silver
escaped
his
wand
and
hovered
like
mist
before
him
the
same
moment
Harry
felt
Hermione
collapse
next
him
was
alone
completely
alone
Expecto
expecto
patronum
Harry
felt
his
knees
hit
the
cold
grass
Fog
was
clouding
his
eyes
With
huge
effort
fought
remember
Sirius
was
innocent

mgoing
live
with
him
ecto

gasped
the
feeble
light
his
formless
Patronus
saw
dementor
halt
very
close
him
couldn
walk
through
the
cloud
silver
mist
Harry
had
conjured
dead
slimy
hand
slid
out
from
under
the
cloak
made
gesture
though
sweep
the
Patronus
aside
Harry
gasped
innocent
expecto
expecto
patronum
could
feet
them
watching
him
hear
their
rattling
breath
like
evil
wind
around
him
The
nearest
dementor
seemed
considering
him
Then
raised
both
its
rotting
hands
and
lowered
its
hood
Where
there
should
have
been
eyes
there
was
only
thin
gray
scabbed
skin
stretched
blankly
over
empty
sockets
But
there
was
mouth
gaping
shapeless
hole
sucking
the
air
with
the
sound
death
rattle
paralyzing
terror
filled
Harry
that
couldn
move
speak
His
Patronus
flickered
and
died
White
fog
was
blinding
him
had
fight
expecto
patronum
couldn
see
and
the
distance
heard
the
familiar
screaming
expecto
patronum
groped
the
mist
for
Sirius
and
found
his
arm
they
weren
going
take
him
But
pair
strong
clammy
hands
suddenly
attached
themselves
around
Harry
neck
They
were
forcing
his
face
upward
could
feel
its
breath
was
going
get
rid
him
first
could
feel
its
putrid
breath
His
mother
was
screaming
his
ears
She
was
going
the
last
thing
ever
heard
And
then
through
the
fog
that
was
drowning
him
thought
saw
silvery
light
growing
brighter
and
brighter
felt
himself
fall
forward
onto
the
grass
Facedown
too
weak
move
sick
and
shaking
Harry
opened
his
eyes
The
dementor
must
have
released
him
The
blinding
light
was
illuminating
the
grass
around
him
The
screaming
had
stopped
the
cold
was
ebbing
away
Something
was
driving
the
dementors
back
was
circling
around
him
and
Black
and
Hermione
They
were
leaving
The
air
was
warm
again
With
every
ounce
strength
could
muster
Harry
raised
his
head
few
inches
and
saw
animal
amid
the
light
galloping
away
across
the
lake
Eyes
blurred
with
sweat
Harry
tried
make
out
what
was
was
bright
unicorn
Fighting
stay
conscious
Harry
watched
canter
halt
reached
the
opposite
shore
For
moment
Harry
saw
its
brightness
somebody
welcoming
back
raising
his
hand
pat
someone
who
looked
strangely
familiar
but
couldn
Harry
didn
understand
couldn
think
anymore
felt
the
last
his
strength
leave
him
and
his
head
hit
the
ground
fainted

and
she
seized

The

Something
about

Pettigrew
being
alive
That
indeed
Black
story
said
Dumbledore
surveying
Snape
closely
through
his
half
moon
spectacles
And
does
evidence
count
for
nothing
snarled
Snape
Peter
Pettigrew
was
not
the
Shrieking
Shack
nor
did
see
any
sign
him
the
grounds
That
was
because
you
were
knocked
out
Professor
said
Hermione
earnestly
You
didn
arrive
time

Miss
Granger
HOLD
YOUR
TONGUE
Now
Snape
said
Fudge
startled
the
young

Dumbledore
abruptly
Cornelius

Headmaster
sputtered
Madam
Pomfrey
They
need
treatment
they
need
rest
This
cannot
wait
said
Dumbledore
must
insist
Madam
Pomfrey
pursed
her
lips
and
strode
away
into
her
office
the
end
the
ward
slamming
the
door
behind
her
Fudge
consulted
the
large
gold
pocket
watch
dangling
from
his
waistcoat
The
dementors
should
have
arrived
now
said
and
meet
them
Dumbledore
see
you
upstairs
crossed
the
door
and
held
open
for
Snape
but
Snape
hadn
moved
You
surely
don
believe
word
Black
story
Snape
whispered
his
eyes
fixed
Dumbledore
face
wish

Harry
and
Hermione
alone
Dumbledore
repeated
Snape
took
step
toward
Dumbledore
Sirius
Black
showed
was
capable

the
age
sixteen
breathed
You
haven
forgotten
that
Headmaster
You
haven
forgotten
that
once
tried
kill
memory
good
ever
was
Severus
said
Dumbledore
quietly
Snape
turned
his
heel
and
marched
through
the
door
Fudge
was
still
holding
closed
behind
them
and
Dumbledore
turned
Harry
and
Hermione
They
both
burst
into
speech
the
same
time
Professor
Black
telling
the
truth
saw
Pettigrew
escaped
when
Professor
Lupin
turned
into
werewolf
rat
Pettigrew
front
paw
mean
finger
cut
off
Pettigrew
attacked
Ron
wasn
Sirius
But
Dumbledore
held
his
hand
stem
the
flood
explanations
your
turn
listen
and
beg
you
will
not
interrupt
because
there
very
little
time
said
quietly
There
not
shred
proof
support
Black
story
except
your
word
and
the
word
two
thirteen
year
old
wizards
will
not
convince
anybody
street
full
eyewitnesses
swore
they
saw
Sirius
murder
Pettigrew
myself
gave
evidence
the
Ministry
that
Sirius
had
been
the
Potters
Secret
Keeper
Professor
Lupin
can
tell
you
Harry
said
unable
stop
himself
Professor
Lupin
currently
deep
the
forest
unable
tell
anyone
anything
the
time
human
again
will
too
late
Sirius
will
worse
than
dead
might
add
that
werewolves
are
mistrusted
most
our
kind
that
his
support
will
count
for
very
little
and
the
fact
that
and
Sirius
are
old
friends
But
Listen
Harry
too
late
you
understand
You
must
see
that
Professor
Snape
version
events
far
more
convincing
than
yours
hates
Sirius
Hermione
said
desperately
All
because
some
stupid
trick
Sirius
played
him
Sirius
has
not
acted
like
innocent
man
The
attack
the
Fat
Lady
entering
Gryffindor
Tower
with
knife
without
Pettigrew
alive
dead
have
chance
overturning
Sirius
sentence
But
you
believe
Yes
said
Dumbledore
quietly
But
have
power
make
other
men
see
the
truth
overrule
the
Minister
Magic
Harry
stared
into
the
grave
face
and
felt
though
the
ground
beneath
him
were
falling
sharply
away
had
grown
used
the
idea
that
Dumbledore
could
solve
anything
had
expected
Dumbledore
pull
some
amazing
solution
out
the
air
But
their
last
hope
was
gone
What
need
said
Dumbledore
slowly
and
his
light
blue
eyes
moved
from
Harry
Hermione
more
time
But
Hermione
began
And
then
her
eyes
became
very
round
Now
pay
attention
said
Dumbledore
speaking
very
low
and
very
clearly
Sirius
locked
Professor
Flitwick
office
the
seventh
floor
Thirteenth
window
from
the
right
the
West
Tower
all
goes
well
you
will
able
save
more
than
one
innocent
life

But
remember
this
both
you
you
must
not
seen
Miss
Granger
you
know
the
law
you
know
what
stake
You
must
not
seen
Harry
didn
have
clue
what
was
going
Dumbledore
had
turned
his
heel
and
looked
back
reached
the
door
going
lock
you
consulted
his
watch
five
minutes
midnight
Miss
Granger
three
turns
should
Good
luck
Good
luck
Harry
repeated
the
door
closed
behind
Dumbledore
Three
turns
What
talking
about
What
are
supposed
But
Hermione
was
fumbling
with
the
neck
her
robes
pulling
from
beneath
them
very
long
very
fine
gold
chain
Harry
come
here
she
said
urgently
Quick
Harry
moved
toward
her
completely
bewildered
She
was
holding
the
chain
out
saw
tiny
sparkling
hourglass
hanging
from
Here
She
had
thrown
the
chain
around
his
neck
too
Ready
she
said
breathlessly
What
are
doing
Harry
said
completely
lost
Hermione
turned
the
hourglass
over
three
times
The
dark
ward
dissolved
Harry
had
the
sensation
that
was
flying
very
fast
backward
blur
colors
and
shapes
rushed
past
him
his
ears
were
pounding
tried
yell
but
couldn
hear
his
own
voice
And
then
felt
solid
ground
beneath
his
feet
and
everything
came
into
focus
again
was
standing
next
Hermione
the
deserted
entrance
hall
and
stream
golden
sunlight
was
falling
across
the
paved
floor
from
the
open
front
doors
looked
wildly
around
Hermione
the
chain
the
hourglass
cutting
into
his
neck
Hermione
what
here
Hermione
seized
Harry
arm
and
dragged
him
across
the
hall
the
door
broom
closet
she
opened
pushed
him
inside
among
the
buckets
and
mops
then
slammed
the
door
behind
them
What
how
Hermione
what
happened
gone
back
time
Hermione
whispered
lifting
the
chain
off
Harry
neck
the
darkness
Three
hours
back
Harry
found
his
own
leg
and
gave
very
hard
pinch
hurt
lot
which
seemed
rule
out
the
possibility
that
was
having
very
bizarre
dream
But
Shh
Listen
Someone
coming
think
think
might
Hermione
had
her
ear
pressed
against
the
cupboard
door
Footsteps
across
the
hall

Harry
whispered
that

cupboard
and
out
there
too
Yes
said
Hermione
her
ear
still
glued
the
cupboard
door
sure
doesn
sound
like
more
than
three
people
and
walking
slowly
because
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
She
broke
off
still
listening
intently
gone
down
the
front
steps
Hermione
sat
down
upturned
bucket
looking
desperately
anxious
but
Harry
wanted
few
questions
answered
Where

get
that
hourglass
thing
called
Time

Hermione
whispered
and
got
from
Professor
McGonagall

shadowy
face
There

slowly
What

hours

Hermione
just

frowned
felt
though

screwing
his
whole
brain
concentration
Dumbledore

And

terrified

Well

Harry
stood
and
pressed
his
ear
against
the
door
Doesn
sound
like
anyone
there
Come
let
Harry
pushed
open
the
closet
door
The
entrance
hall
was
deserted
quietly
and
quickly
they
could
they
darted
out
the
closet
and
down
the
stone
steps
The
shadows
were
already
lengthening
the
tops
the
trees
the
Forbidden
Forest
gilded
once
more
with
gold
anyone
looking
out
the
window
Hermione
squeaked
looking
the
castle
behind
them
run
for
said
Harry
determinedly
Straight
into
the
forest
all
right
have
hide
behind
tree
something
and
keep
lookout
Okay
but
around
the
greenhouses
said
Hermione
breathlessly
need
keep
out
sight
Hagrid
front
door
see
must
nearly
Hagrid
now
Still
working
out
what
she
meant
Harry
set
off
sprint
Hermione
behind
him
They
tore
across
the
vegetable
gardens
the
greenhouses
paused
for
moment
behind
them
then
set
off
again
fast
they
could
skirting
around
the
Whomping
Willow
tearing
toward
the
shelter
the
forest
Safe
the
shadows
the
trees
Harry
turned
around
seconds
later
Hermione
arrived
beside
him
panting
Right
she
gasped
need
sneak
over
Hagrid
Keep
out
sight
Harry
They
made
their
way
silently
through
the
trees
keeping
the
very
edge
the
forest
Then
they
glimpsed
the
front
Hagrid
house
they
heard
knock
upon
his
door
They
moved
quickly
behind
wide
oak
trunk
and
peered
out
from
either
side
Hagrid
had
appeared
his
doorway
shaking
and
white
looking
around
see
who
had
knocked
And
Harry
heard
his
own
voice
wearing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
Let
and
can
take
off
Yeh
shouldn
come
Hagrid
whispered
stood
back
then
shut
the
door
quickly
This
the
weirdest
thing
ever
done
Harry
said
fervently
Let
move
along
bit
Hermione
whispered
need
get
nearer
Buckbeak
They
crept
through
the
trees
until
they
saw
the
nervous
hippogriff
tethered
the
fence
around
Hagrid
pumpkin
patch
Now
Harry
whispered
said
Hermione
steal
him
now
those
Committee
people

think
Hagrid
set
him
free
got
wait
until
they
seen
tied
outside
That
going

about
sixty
seconds
said
Harry
This
was
starting
seem
impossible
that
moment
there
was
crash
breaking
china
from
inside
Hagrid
cabin
That
Hagrid
breaking
the
milk
jug
Hermione
whispered
going
find
Scabbers
moment
Sure
enough
few
minutes
later
they
heard
Hermione
shriek
surprise
Hermione
said
Harry
suddenly
what
just
run
there
and
grab
Pettigrew
said
Hermione
terrified
whisper
Don

Hermione

Harry

Dark
Magic

Exactly
You

even

Don

Professor
McGonagall
told

Loads

their
past
future
selves
mistake
Okay
said
Harry
was
just
idea
just
thought
But
Hermione
nudged
him
and
pointed
toward
the
castle
Harry
moved
his
head
few
inches
get
clear
view
the
distant
front
doors
Dumbledore
Fudge
the
old
Committee
member
and
Macnair
the
executioner
were
coming
down
the
steps
about
come
out
Hermione
breathed
And
sure
enough
moments
later
Hagrid
back
door
opened
and
Harry
saw
himself
Ron
and
Hermione
walking
out
with
Hagrid
was
without
doubt
the
strangest
sensation
his
life
standing
behind
the
tree
and
watching
himself
the
pumpkin
patch
Okay
Beaky

Hagrid
said
Buckbeak
Then
turned
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
Get

Hagrid

tell
them
what
really
happened
They
can
kill
him
bad
enough
without
you
lot
trouble

Harry
watched
the
Hermione
the
pumpkin
patch
throw
the
Invisibility
Cloak
over
him
and
Ron
quick
Don
listen
There
was
knock
Hagrid
front
door
The
execution
party
had
arrived
Hagrid
turned
around
and
headed
back
into
his
cabin
leaving
the
back
door
ajar
Harry
watched
the
grass
flatten
patches
all
around
the
cabin
and
heard
three
pairs
feet
retreating
Ron
and
Hermione
had
gone
but
the
Harry
and
Hermione
hidden
the
trees
could
now
hear
what
was
happening
inside
the
cabin
through
the
back
door
Where
the
beast
came
the
cold
voice
Macnair
Out
outside
Hagrid
croaked
Harry
pulled
his
head
out
sight
Macnair
face
appeared
Hagrid
window
staring
out
Buckbeak
Then
they
heard
Fudge
have
read
you
the
official
notice

make
quick
And
then
you
and
Macnair

Macnair
You

procedure
Macnair
face
vanished
from
the
window
was
now
never
Wait

Harry
whispered
Hermione
Fudge
voice
started
again
Harry
darted
out
from
behind
his
tree
vaulted
the
fence
into
the
pumpkin
patch
and
approached
Buckbeak
the
decision
the
Committee
for
the
Disposal
Dangerous
Creatures
that
the
hippogriff
Buckbeak
hereafter
called
the
condemned
shall

the
sixth
June
sundown
Careful
not
blink
Harry
stared
into
Buckbeak
fierce
orange
eyes
once
more
and
bowed
Buckbeak
sank
his
scaly
knees
and
then
stood
again
Harry
began
fumble
with
the
knot
rope
tying
Buckbeak

fence
sentenced

carried
out
the
Committee
appointed
executioner
Walden
Macnai
Come

Harry
murmured

Quietly
quietly
witnessed
below
Hagrid

Harry
threw
all
his
weight
onto
the
rope
but
Buckbeak
had
dug
his
front
feet
Well
let
get
this
over
with
said
the
reedy
voice
the
Committee
member
from
inside
Hagrid
cabin
Hagrid
perhaps
will
better
you
stay
inside
wan
ter
with
him
don
wan
him
ter
alone
Footsteps
echoed
from
within
the
cabin
Buckbeak
move
Harry
hissed
Harry
tugged
harder
the
rope
around
Buckbeak
neck
The
hippogriff
began
walk
rustling
its
wings
irritably
They
were
still
ten
feet
away
from
the
forest
plain
view
Hagrid
back
door
One
moment
please
Macnair
came
Dumbledore
voice
You
need
sign
too
The
footsteps
stopped
Harry
heaved
the
rope
Buckbeak
snapped
his
beak
and
walked
little
faster
Hermione
white
face
was
sticking
out
from
behind
tree
Harry
hurry
she
mouthed
Harry
could
still
hear
Dumbledore
voice
talking
from
within
the
cabin
gave
the
rope
another
wrench
Buckbeak
broke
into
grudging
trot
They
had
reached
the
trees
Quick
Quick
Hermione
moaned
darting
out
from
behind
her
tree
seizing
the
rope
too
and
adding
her
weight
make
Buckbeak
move
faster
Harry
looked
over
his
shoulder
they
were
now
blocked
from
sight
they
couldn
see
Hagrid
garden
all
Stop
whispered
Hermione
They
might
hear
Hagrid
back
door
had
opened
with
bang
Harry
Hermione
and
Buckbeak
stood
quite
still
even
the
hippogriff
seemed
listening
intently
Silence
then
Where
said
the
reedy
voice
the
Committee
member
Where
the
beast
was
tied
here
said
the
executioner
furiously
saw
just
here
How
extraordinary
said
Dumbledore
There
was
note
amusement
his
voice
Beaky
said
Hagrid
huskily
There
was
swishing
noise
and
the
thud
axe
The
executioner
seemed
have
swung
into
the
fence
anger
And
then
came
the
howling
and
this
time
they
could
hear
Hagrid
words
through
his
sobs
Gone
Gone
Bless
his
little
beak
gone
Musta
pulled
himself
free
Beaky
yeh
clever
boy
Buckbeak
started
strain
against
the
rope
trying
get
back
Hagrid
Harry
and
Hermione
tightened
their
grip
and
dug
their
heels
into
the
forest
floor
stop
him
Someone
untied
him
the
executioner
was
snarling
should
search
the
grounds
the
forest
Macnair
Buckbeak

the
thief
will
have
led

and
Hermione
listened
closely
They
heard
footsteps

soft
cursing
the
executioner

snap

door
and
then
silence
once
more
Now

depths

forest
The

Harry

Hermione

grip
Buckbeak
rope
But

keep
out

Harry
remember
They
moved
around
the
edge
the
forest
darkness
falling
thickly
around
them
until
they
were
hidden
behind
clump
trees
through
which
they
could
make
out
the
Willow
There
Ron
said
Harry
suddenly
dark
figure
was
sprinting
across
the
lawn
and
its
shout
echoed
through
the
still
night
air
Get
away
from
him
get
away
Scabbers
come
here
And
then
they
saw
two
more
figures
materialize
out
nowhere
Harry
watched
himself
and
Hermione
chasing
after
Ron
Then
saw
Ron
dive
Gotcha
Get
off
you
stinking
cat
There
Sirius
said
Harry
The
great
shape
the
dog
had
bounded
out
from
the
roots
the
Willow
They
saw
him
bowl
Harry
over
then
seize
Ron
Looks
even
worse
from
here

said
Harry
watching
the
dog
pulling
Ron
into
the
roots
Ouch
look
just
got
walloped
the
tree
and
did
you
this
weird
The
Whomping
Willow
was
creaking
and
lashing
out
with
its
lower
branches
they
could
see
themselves
darting
here
and
there
trying
reach
the
trunk
And
then
the
tree
froze
That
was
Crookshanks
pressing
the
knot
said
Hermione
And
there
Harry
muttered
The
moment
they
disappeared
the
tree
began
move
again
Seconds
later
they
heard
footsteps
quite
close
Dumbledore
Macnair
Fudge
and
the
old
Committee
member
were
making
their
way
the
castle
Right
after
gone
down
into
the
passage
said
Hermione
only
Dumbledore

with
Macnair
and
Fudge
would
come
too
said
Harry
bitterly
bet

Fudge
would
told
Macnair
murder
Sirius
the
spot
They
watched
the
four
men
climb
the
castle
steps
and
disappear
from
view
For
few
minutes
the
scene
was
deserted
Then
Here
comes
Lupin
said
Harry
they
saw
another
figure
sprinting
down
the
stone
steps
and
hating
toward
the
Willow
Harry
looked
the
sky
Clouds
were
obscuring
the
moon
completely
They
watched
Lupin
seize
broken
branch
from
the
ground
and
prod
the
knot
the
trunk
The
tree
stopped
fighting
and
Lupin
too
disappeared
into
the
gap
its
roots
only
grabbed
the
cloak
said
Harry
just
lying
there
turned
Hermione
just
dashed
out
now
and
grabbed
Snape

Harry
Hermione
seized
the
back
Harry
robes
not
moment
too
soon
just
then
they
heard
burst
song
was
Hagrid
making
his
way
the
castle
singing
the
top
his
voice
and
weaving
slightly
walked
large
bottle
was
swinging
from
his
hands
See
Hermione
whispered
See
what
would
have
happened
got
keep
out
sight
Buckbeak
The
hippogriff
was
making
frantic
attempts
get
Hagrid
again
Harry
seized
his
rope
too
straining
hold
Buckbeak
back
They
watched
Hagrid
meander
tipsily
the
castle
was
gone
Buckbeak
stopped
fighting
get
away
His
head
drooped
sadly
Barely
two
minutes
later
the
castle
doors
flew
open
yet
again
and
Snape
came
charging
out
them
running
toward
the
Willow
Harry
fists
clenched
they
watched
Snape
skid
halt
next
the
tree
looking
around
grabbed
the
cloak
and
held
Get
your
filthy
hands
off
Harry
snarled
under
his
breath
Shh
Snape
seized
the
branch
Lupin
had
used
freeze
the
tree
prodded
the
knot
and
vanished
from
view

the
cloak

said
Hermione
quietly
all
down
there
and
now
just
got
wait
until
come
back
again
She
took
the
end
Buckbeak
rope
and
tied
securely
around
the
nearest
tree
then
sat
down
the
dry
ground
arms
around
her
knees
Harry
there
something
don
understand
Why
didn
the
dementors
get
Sirius
remember
them
coming
and
then
think
passed
out

many
them
Harry
sat
down
too
explained
what
seen
how
the
nearest
dementor
had
lowered
its
mouth
Harry
large
silver
something
had
come
galloping
across
the
lake
and
forced
the
dementors
retreat
Hermione
mouth
was
slightly
open
the
time
Harry
had
finished
But
what
was
There
only
one
thing
could
have
been
make
the
dementors
said
Harry
real
Patronus
powerful
one
But
who
conjured
Harry
didn
say
anything
was
thinking
back
the
person
seen
the
other
bank
the
lake
knew
who
thought
had
been
but
how
could
have
been
Didn
you

Hermione
eagerly

But

all
those
dementors
away

Patronus
was
shining
brightly

light
him
Couldn

Harry
slowly
But
maybe
imagined

thinking
straight
passed
out
right
afterward
Who
did
you
think

Harry
swallowed
knowing
how
strange
this
was
going
sound
think
was
dad
Harry
glanced
Hermione
and
saw
that
her
mouth
was
fully
open
now
She
was
gazing
him
with
mixture
alarm
and
pity
Harry
your
dad
well
dead
she
said
quietly

said
Harry
quickly
You
think
you
saw
his
ghost

But

Maybe

seeing
things
said
Harry
But
from
what
could

Hermione
was
still
looking
him
though
worried
about
his
sanity

said
Harry
flatly
turned
took
Buckbeak
who
was
digging
his
beak
into
the
ground
apparently
searching
for
worms
But
wasn
really
watching
Buckbeak
was
thinking
about
his
father
and
about
his
father
three
oldest
friends
Moony
Wormtail
Padfoot
and
Prongs
Had
all
four
them
been
out
the
grounds
tonight
Wormtail
had
reappeared
this
evening
when
everyone
had
thought
was
dead
Was
impossible
his
father
had
done
the
same
Had
been
seeing
things
across
the
take
The
figure
had
been
too
far
away
see
distinctly
yet
had
felt
sure
for
moment
before
lost
consciousness
The
leaves
overhead
rustled
faintly
the
breeze
The
moon
drifted
and
out
sight
behind
the
shifting
clouds
Hermione
sat
with
her
face
turned
toward
the
Willow
waiting
And
then
last
after
over
hour
Here

Hermione
whispered
She
and
Harry
got
their
feet
Buckbeak
raised
his
head
They
saw
Lupin
Ron
and
Pettigrew
clambering
awkwardly
out
the
hole
the
roots
Then
came
Hermione
then
the
unconscious
Snape
drifting
weirdly
upward
Next
came
Harry
and
Black
They
all
began
walk
toward
the
castle
Harry

sky
Any

All

The

out
from

its
cloud
They
saw

tiny
figures
across
the
grounds

Then
they
saw

and
Hermione
and
Buckbeak
flashed
past

Harry

Fang

Hermione

she
said
Harry

Buckbeak
seemed
very
happy

distance
That
meant
the
dementors
were
closing
Sirius
and
Hermione
would

Harry
stared
out
toward
the
lake
his
heart
doing
kind
drumroll

chest
Whoever

And
there
were
the
dementors
They
were
emerging
out
the
darkness
from
every
direction
gliding
around
the
edges
the
lake
They
were
moving
away
from
where
Harry
stood
the
opposite
bank
wouldn
have

Harry
began

The

glimmers
silver

own
attempts
Patronus
There
was
bush

very
edge

water
Harry
threw
himself
behind
peering
desperately
through
the
leaves
the
opposite
bank
the
glimmers
silver
were
suddenly
extinguished
terrified
excitement
shot
through
him
any
moment
now
Come

staring
about
Where

But

Harry
raised

head

across
the
lake
One
them
was

this
time
And
then
hit
him

Harry
flung
himself
out
from
behind
the
bush
and
pulled
out

yelled
And
out

end
his
wand

his
eyes
trying

was
galloping
silently
away
from
him
across
the
black
surface
the
lake
saw
lower
its
head
and
charge
the
swarming
dementors
Now
was
galloping
around
and
around
the
black
shapes
the
ground
and
the
dementors
were
falling
back
scattering
retreating
into
the
darkness
They
were
gone
The
Patronus

cantering
back
toward
Harry
across
the

Its

made
mark
the
soft
ground
stared
Harry
with
its
large
silver
eyes
Slowly
bowed
its
antlered
head
And
Harry
realized
Prongs
whispered
But
his
trembling
fingertips
stretched
toward
the
creature
vanished
Harry
stood
there
hand
still
outstretched
Then
with
great
leap
his
heart
heard
hooves
behind
him
whirled
around
and
saw
Hermione
dashing
toward
him
dragging
Buckbeak
behind
her

and
down
tightly
spiraling
stone
staircase
they
reached
the
bottom
they
heard
voices
They
flattened
themselves
against
the
wall
and
listened
sounded
like
Fudge
and
Snape
They
were
walking
quickly
along
the
corridor
the
foot
the
staircase
only
hope
Dumbledore
not
going
make
difficulties
Snape
was
saying
The
Kiss
will
performed
immediately
soon
Macnair
returns
with
the
dementors
This
whole
Black
affair
has
been
highly
embarrassing
can
tell
you
how
much
looking
forward
informing
the
Daily
Prophet
that
got
him
last
daresay
they
want
interview
you
Snape
and
once
young
Harry
back
his
right
mind
expect
want
tell
the
Prophet
exactly
how
you
saved
him
Harry
clenched
his
teeth
caught
glimpse
Snape
smirk
and
Fudge
passed
Harry
and
Hermione
hiding
place
Their
footsteps
died
away
Harry
and
Hermione
waited
few
moments
make
sure
they
really
gone
then
started
run
the
opposite
direction
Down
one
staircase
then
another
along
new
corridor
then
they
heard
cackling
ahead
Peeves
Harry
muttered
grabbing
Hermione
wrist
here
They
tore
into
deserted
classroom
their
left
just
time
Peeves
seemed
bouncing
along
the
corridor
boisterous
good
spirits
laughing
his
head
off
horrible
whispered
Hermione
her
ear
the
door
bet
all
excited
because
the
dementors
are
going
finish
off
Sirius
She
checked
her
watch
Three
minutes
Harry
They
waited
until
Peeves
gloating
voice
had
faded
into
the
distance
then
slid
back
out
the
room
and
broke
into
run
again
Hermione
what
happen
don
get
back
inside
before
Dumbledore
locks
the
door
Harry
panted
don
want
think
about
Hermione
moaned
checking
her
watch
again
One
minute
They
had
reached
the
end
the
corridor
with
the
hospital
wing
entrance
Okay
can
hear
Dumbledore
said
Hermione
tensely
Come
Harry
They
crept
along
the
corridor
The
door
opened
Dumbledore
back
appeared
going
lock
you
they
heard
him
saying
five
minutes
midnight
Miss
Granger
three
turns
should
Good
luck
Dumbledore
backed
out
the
room
closed
the
door
and
took
out
his
wand
magically
lock
Panicking
Harry
and
Hermione
ran
forward
Dumbledore
looked
and
wide
smile
appeared
under
the
long
silver
mustache
Well
said
quietly
did
said
Harry
breathlessly
Sirius
has
gone
Buckbeak
Dumbledore
beamed
them
Well

listened
intently
for
any
sound
within
the
hospital
wing
Yes
think

too

Harry
and
Hermione
slipped
back
inside
the
dormitory
was
empty
except
for
Ron
who
was
still
lying
motionless
the
end
bed
the
lock
clicked
behind
them
Harry
and
Hermione
crept
back
their
own
beds
Hermione
tucking
the
Time
Turner
back
under
her
robes
moment
later
Madam
Pomfrey
came
striding
back
out
her
office
Did
hear
the
headmaster
leaving
allowed
look
after
patients
now
She
was
very
bad
mood
Harry
and
Hermione
thought
best
accept
their
chocolate
quietly
Madam
Pomfrey
stood
over
them
making
sure
they
ate
But
Harry
could
hardly
swallow
and
Hermione
were
waiting
listening
their
nerves
jangling
And
then
they
both
took
fourth
piece
chocolate
from
Madam
Pomfrey
they
heard
distant
roar
fury
echoing
from
somewhere
above
them
What
was
that
said
Madam
Pomfrey
alarm
Now
they
could
hear
angry
voices
growing
louder
and
louder
Madam
Pomfrey
was
staring
the
door
Really
they
wake
everybody
What
they
think
they
doing
Harry
was
trying
hear
what
the
voices
were
saying
They
were
drawing
nearer
must
have
Disapparated
Severus
should
have
left
somebody
the
room
with
him
When
this
gets
out
DIDN
DISAPPARATE
Snape
roared
now
very
close
hand
YOU
CAN
APPARATE
DISAPPARATE
INSIDE
THIS
CASTLE
THIS
HAS
SOMETHING
WITH
POTTER
Severus
reasonable
Harry
has
been
locked
BAM
The
door
the
hospital
wing
burst
open
Fudge
Snape
and
Dumbledore
came
striding
into
the
ward
Dumbledore
alone
looked
calm
Indeed
looked
though
was
quite
enjoying
himself
Fudge
appeared
angry
But
Snape
was
beside
himself
OUT
WITH
POTTER
bellowed
WHAT
DID
YOU
Professor
Snape
shrieked
Madam
Pomfrey
Control
yourself
See
here
Snape
reasonable
said
Fudge
This
door
been
locked
just
saw
THEY
HELPED
HIM
ESCAPE
KNOW
Snape
howled
pointing
Harry
and
Hermione
His
face
was
twisted
spit
was
flying
from
his
mouth
Calm
down
man
Fudge
barked
You
talking
nonsense
YOU
DON
KNOW
POTTER
shrieked
Snape
DID
KNOW
DID
That
will
Severus
said
Dumbledore
quietly
Think
about
what
you
are
saying
This
door
has
been
locked
since
left
the
ward
ten
minutes
ago
Madam
Pomfrey
have
these
students
left
their
beds
course
not
said
Madam
Pomfrey
bristling
would
have
heard
them
Well
there
you
have
Severus
said
Dumbledore
calmly
Unless
you
are
suggesting
that
Harry
and
Hermione
are
able
two
places
once
afraid
don
see
any
point
troubling
them
further
Snape
stood
there
seething
staring
from
Fudge
who
looked
thoroughly
shocked
his
behavior
Dumbledore
whose
eyes
were
twinkling
behind
his
glasses
Snape
whirled
about
robes
swishing
behind
him
and
stormed
out
the
ward
Fellow
seems
quite
unbalanced
said
Fudge
staring
after
him
watch
out
for
him
were
you
Dumbledore
not
unbalanced
said
Dumbledore
quietly
just
suffered
severe
disappointment
not
the
only
one
puffed
Fudge
The
Daily
Prophet
going
have
field
day
had
Black
cornered
and
slipped
through
our
fingers
yet
again
All
needs
now
for
the
story
that
hippogriff
escape
get
out
and
laughingstock
Well
better
and
notify
the
Ministry
And
the
dementors
said
Dumbledore
They
removed
from
the
school
trust
yes
they
have
said
Fudge
running
his
fingers
distractedly
through
his
hair
Never
dreamed
they
attempt
administer
the
Kiss
innocent
boy
Completely
out
control
have
them
packed
off
back
Azkaban
tonight
Perhaps
should
think
about
dragons
the
school
entrance
Hagrid
would
like
that
said
Dumbledore
smiling
Harry
and
Hermione
and
Fudge
left
the
dormitory
Madam
Pomfrey
hurried
the
door
and
locked
again
Muttering
angrily
herself
she
headed
back
her
office
There
was
low
moan
from
the
other
end
the
ward
Ron
had
woken
They
could
see
him
sitting
rubbing
his
head
looking
around
What
what
happened
groaned
Harry
Why
are
here
Where
Sirius
Where
Lupin
What
going
Harry
and
Hermione
looked
each
other
You
explain
said
Harry
helping
himself
some
more
chocolate
When
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
left
the
hospital
wing
noon
the
next
day
was
find
almost
deserted
castle
The
sweltering
heat
and
the
end
the
exams
meant
that
everyone
was
taking
full
advantage
another
Hogsmeade
visit
Neither
Ron
nor
Hermione
felt
like
going
however
they
and
Harry
wandered
onto
the
grounds
still
talking
about
the
extraordinary
events
the
previous
night
and
wondering
where
Sirius
and
Buckbeak
were
now
Sitting
near
the
lake
watching
the
giant
squid
waving
its
tentacles
lazily
above
the
water
Harry
lost
the
thread
the
conversation
looked
across
the
opposite
bank
The
stag
had
galloped
toward
him
from
there
just
last
night
shadow
fell
across
them
and
they
looked
tip
see
very
bleary
eyed
Hagrid
mopping
his
sweaty
face
with
one
his
tablecloth
sized
handkerchiefs
and
beaming
down
them
Know

feel
happy
after
wha
happened
las

said
mean
Black

but

What

said
Hermione
giving
Ron
reproving
look
because
looked
though

close
laughing
Yeah

said
Hagrid
gazing
happily
out
over
the
grounds
was
worried
this
mornin
mind
thought
mighta

Professor
Lupin
the
grounds
but
Lupin
says

What

Harry
quickly
Blimey

Hagrid
his
smile
fading
little
lowered
his
voice
even
though
there
was
nobody
sight
Snape
told
all
the
Slytherins
this
mornin
Thought

Professor
Lupin

said
Harry
alarmed
Why
Leavin

said
Hagrid
looking
surprised
that
Harry
had
ask
Resigned

mornin
Says

Harry
scrambled
his
feet
going

him
said
Ron
and
Hermione
But
resigned
doesn
sound
like
there
anything
can
don
care
still
want
see
him
meet
you
back
here
Lupin
office
door
was
open
had
already
packed
most
his
things
The
grindylow
empty
tank
stood
next
his
battered
old
suitcase
which
was
open
and
nearly
full
Lupin
was
bending
over
something
his
desk
and
looked
only
when
Harry
knocked
the
door
saw
you
coming
said
Lupin
smiling
pointed
the
parchment
had
been
poring
over
was
the
Marauder
Map
just
saw
Hagrid
said
Harry
And
said
you
resigned
not
true
afraid
said
Lupin
started
opening
his
desk
drawers
and
taking
out
the
contents
Why
said
Harry
The
Ministry
Magic
don
think
you
were
helping
Sirius
they
Lupin
crossed
the
door
and
closed
behind
Harry
Professor
Dumbledore
managed
convince
Fudge
that
was
trying
save
your
lives
sighed
That
was
the
final
straw
for
Severus
think
the
loss
the
Order
Merlin
hit
him
hard
accidentally
let
slip
that
werewolf
this
morning
breakfast
You
not
leaving
just
because
that
said
Harry
Lupin
smiled
wryly
This
time
tomorrow
the
owls
will
start
arriving
from
parents
They
will
not
want
werewolf
teaching
their
children
Harry
And
after
last
night
see
their
point
could
have
bitten
any
you
That
must
never
happen
again
You
the
best
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
ever
had
said
Harry
Don
Lupin
shook
his
head
and
didn
speak
carried
emptying
his
drawers
Then
while
Harry
was
trying
think
good
argument
make
him
stay
Lupin
said
From
what
the
headmaster
told
this
morning
you
saved
lot
lives
last
night
Harry
proud
anything
done
this
year
how
much
you
learned
Tell
about
your
Patronus
How
you
know
about
that
said
Harry
distracted
What
else
could
have
driven
the
dementors
back
Harry
told
Lupin
what
had
happened
When
finished
Lupin
was
smiling
again
Yes
your
father
was
always
stag
when
transformed
said
You
guessed
right
that
why
called
him
Prongs
Lupin
threw
his
last
few
books
into
his
case
closed
the
desk
drawers
and
turned
look
Harry
Here
brought
this
from
the
Shrieking
Shack
last
night
said
handing
Harry
back
the
Invisibility
Cloak
And
hesitated
then
held
out
the
Marauder
Map
too
longer
your
teacher
don
feel
guilty
about
giving
you
back
this
well
use
and
daresay
you
Ron
and
Hermione
will
find
uses
for
Harry
took
the
map
and
grinned
You
told
Moony
Wormtail
Padfoot
and
Prongs
would
wanted
lure
out
school
you
said
they
have
thought
was
funny
And
would
have
said
Lupin
now
reaching
down
close
his
case
have
hesitation
saying
that
James
would
have
been
highly
disappointed
his
son
had
never
found
any
the
secret
passages
out
the
castle
There
was
knock
the
door
Harry
hastily
stuffed
the
Marauder
Map
and
the
Invisibility
Cloak
into
his
pocket
was
Professor
Dumbledore
didn
look
surprised
see
Harry
there
Your
carriage
the
gates
Remus
said
Thank
You
Headmaster
Lupin
picked
his
old
suitcase
and
the
empty
grindylow
tank
Well
good
bye
Harry
said
smiling
has
been
real
pleasure
teaching
you
feel
sure
meet
again
sometime
Headmaster
there
need
see
the
gates
can
manage
Harry
had
the
impression
that
Lupin
wanted
leave
quickly
possible
Good
bye
then
Remus
said
Dumbledore
soberly
Lupin
shifted
the
grindylow
tank
slightly
that
and
Dumbledore
could
shake
hands
Then
with
final
nod
Harry
and
swift
smile
Lupin
left
the
office
Harry
sat
down
his
vacated
chair
staring
glumly
the
floor
heard
the
door
close
and
looked
Dumbledore
was
still
there
Why
miserable
Harry
said
quietly
You
should
very
proud
yourself
after
last
night
didn
make
any
difference
said
Harry
bitterly
Pettigrew
got
away
Didn
make
any
difference
said
Dumbledore
quietly
made
all
the
difference
the
world
Harry
You
helped
uncover
the
truth
You
saved
innocent
man
from
terrible
fate
Terrible
Something
stirred
Harry
memory
Greater
and
more
terrible
than
ever
before
Professor
Trelawney
prediction
Professor
Dumbledore
yesterday
when
was
having
Divination
exam
Professor
Trelawney
went
very
very
strange
Indeed
said
Dumbledore
stranger
than
usual
you
mean
Yes
her
voice
went
all
deep
and
her
eyes
rolled
and
she
said
she
said
Voldemort
servant
was
going
set
out
return
him
before
midnight
She
said
the
servant
would
help
him
come
back
power
Harry
stared
Dumbledore
And
then
she
sort
became
normal
again
and
she
couldn
remember
anything
she
said
Was
was
she
making
real
prediction
Dumbledore
looked
mildly
impressed
you
know
Harry
think
she
might
have
been
said
thoughtfully
Who
have
thought
That
brings
her
total
real
predictions
two
should
offer
her
pay
raise
But
Harry
looked
him
aghast
How
could
Dumbledore
take
this
calmly
But
stopped
Sirius
and
Professor
Lupin
from
killing
Pettigrew
That
makes
fault
Voldemort
comes
back
does
not
said
Dumbledore
quietly
Hasn
your
experience
with
the
Time
Turner
taught
you
anything
Harry
The
consequences
our
actions
are
always
complicated
diverse
that
predicting
the
future
very
difficult
business
indeed
Professor
Trelawney
bless
her
living
proof
that
You
did
very
noble
thing
saving
Pettigrew
life
But
helps
Voldemort
back
power
Pettigrew
owes
his
life
you
You
have
sent
Voldemort
deputy
who
your
debt
When
one
wizard
saves
another
wizard
life
creates
certain
bond
between
them
and
much
mistaken
Voldemort
wants
his
servant
the
debt
Harry
Potter
don
want
connection
with
Pettigrew
said
Harry
betrayed
parents
This
magic
its
deepest
its
most
impenetrable
Harry
But
trust
the
time
may
come
when
you
will
very
glad
you
saved
Pettigrew
life
Harry
couldn
imagine
when
that
would
Dumbledore
looked
though
knew
what
Harry
was
thinking
knew
your
father
very
well
both
Hogwarts
and
later
Harry
said
gently
would
have
saved
Pettigrew
too
sure
Harry
looked
him
Dumbledore
wouldn
laugh
could
tell
Dumbledore
thought
was
dad
who
conjured
Patronus
mean
when
saw
myself
across
the
lake
thought
was
seeing
him
easy
mistake
make
said
Dumbledore
softly
expect
you
tire
hearing
but
you
look
extraordinarily
like
James
Except
for
the
eyes
you
have
your
mother
eyes
Harry
shook
his
head
was
stupid
thinking
was
him
muttered
mean
knew
was
dead
You
think
the
dead
loved
ever
truly
leave
You
think
that
don
recall
them
more
clearly
than
ever
times
great
trouble
Your
father
alive
you
Harry
and
shows
himself
most
plainly
when
you
have
need
him
How
else
could
you
produce
that
particular
Patronus
Prongs
rode
again
last
night
took
moment
for
Harry
realize
what
Dumblefore
had
said
Last
night
Sirius
told
all
about
how
they
became
Animagi
said
Dumbledore
smiling
extraordinary
achievement
not
least
keeping
quiet
from
And
then
remembered
the
most
unusual
form
your
Patronus
took
when
charged
Malfoy
down
your
Quidditch
match
against
Ravenclaw
You
know
Harry
way
you
did
see
your
father
last
night
You
found
him
inside
yourself
And
Dumbledore
left
the
office
leaving
Harry
his
very
confused
thoughts
Nobody
Hogwarts
now
knew
the
truth
what
had
happened
the
night
that
Sirius
Buckbeak
and
Pettigrew
had
vanished
except
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Professor
Dumbledore
the
end
term
approached
Harry
heard
many
different
theories
about
what
had
really
happened
but
none
them
came
close
the
truth
Malfoy
was
furious
about
Buckbeak
was
convinced
that
Hagrid
had
found
way
smuggling
the
hippogriff
safety
and
seemed
outraged
that
and
his
father
had
been
outwitted
gamekeeper
Percy
Weasley
meanwhile
had
much
say
the
subject
Sirius
escape
manage
get
into
the
Ministry
have
lot
proposals
make
about
Magical
Law
Enforcement
told
the
only
person
who
would
listen
his
girlfriend
Penelope
Though
the
weather
was
perfect
though
the
atmosphere
was
cheerful
though
knew
they
had
achieved
the
near
impossible
helping
Sirius
freedom
Harry
had
never
approached
the
end
school
year
worse
spirits
certainly
wasn
the
only
one
who
was
sorry
see
Professor
Lupin
The
whole
Harry
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
class
was
miserable
about
his
resignation
Wonder
what
they
give
next
year
said
Seamus
Finnigan
gloomily
Maybe
vampire
suggested
Dean
Thomas
hopefully
wasn
only
Professor
Lupin
departure
that
was
weighing
Harry
mind
couldn
help
thinking
lot
about
Professor
Trelawney
prediction
kept
wondering
where
Pettigrew
was
now
whether
had
sought
sanctuary
with
Voldemort
yet
But
the
thing
that
was
lowering
Harry
spirits
most
all
was
the
prospect
returning
the
Dursleys
For
maybe
half
hour
glorious
half
hour
had
believed
would
living
with
Sirius
from
now
his
parents
best
friend
would
have
been
the
next
best
thing
having
his
own
father
back
And
while
news
Sirius
was
definitely
good
news
because
meant
had
successfully
gone
into
hiding
Harry
couldn
help
feeling
miserable
when
thought
the
home
might
have
had
and
the
fact
that
was
now
impossible
The
exam
results
came
out
the
last
day
term
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
passed
every
subject
Harry
was
amazed
that
had
got
through
Potions
had
shrewd
suspicion
that
Dumbledore
might
have
stepped
stop
Snape
failing
him
purpose
Snape
behavior
toward
Harry
over
the
past
week
had
been
quite
alarming
Harry
wouldn
have
thought
possible
that
Snape
dislike
for
him
could
increase
but
certainly
had
muscle
twitched
unpleasantly
the
corner
Snape
thin
mouth
every
time
looked
Harry
and
was
constantly
flexing
his
fingers
though
itching
place
them
around
Harry
throat
Percy
had
got
his
top
grade
Fred
and
George
had
scraped
handful
each
Gryffindor
House
meanwhile
largely
thanks
their
spectacular
performance
the
Quidditch
Cup
had
won
the
House
championship
for
the
third
year
running
This
meant
that
the
end
term
feast
took
place
amid
decorations
scarlet
and
gold
and
that
the
Gryffindor
table
was
the
noisiest
the
lot
everybody
celebrated
Even
Harry
managed
forget
about
the
journey
back
the
Dursleys
the
next
day
ate
drank
talked
and
laughed
with
the
rest
the
Hogwarts
Express
pulled
out
the
station
the
next
mornIng
Hermione
gave
Harry
and
Ron
some
surprising
news
went
see
Professor
McGonagall
this
morning
just
before
breakfast
decided
drop
Muggle
Studies
But
you
passed
your
exam
with
three
hundred
and
twenty
percent
said
Ron
know
sighed
Hermione
but
can
stand
another
year
like
this
one
That
Time
Turner
was
driving
mad
handed
Without
Muggle
Studies
and
Divination
able
have
normal
schedule
again
still
can
believe
you
didn
tell
about
said
Ron
grumpily
supposed
your
friends
promised
wouldn
tell
anyone
said
Hermione
severely
She
looked
around
Harry
who
was
watching
Hogwarts
disappear
from
view
behind
mountain
Two
whole
months
before
see
again
cheer
Harry
said
Hermione
sadly
okay
said
Harry
quickly
Just
thinking
about
the
holidays
Yeah

thinking
about
them
too
said
Ron
Harry

come

stay
with

Mum
and
Dad
then

you
know
how
use
fellytone
now

Ron
said
Hermione
Honestly

should
take
Muggle
Studies
next
year
Ron
ignored
her
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
this
summer
How
about
Harry
Come
and
stay
and
and
see
Dad
can
usually
get
tickets
from
work
This
proposal
had
the
effect
cheering
Harry
great
deal
Yeah
bet
the
Dursleys
pleased
let
come
especially
after
what
did
Aunt
Marge
Feeling
considerably
more
cheerful
Harry
joined
Ron
and
Hermione
several
games
Exploding
Snap
and
when
the
witch
with
the
tea
cart
arrived
bought
himself
very
large
lunch
though
nothing
with
chocolate
But
was
late
the
afternoon
before
the
thing
that
made
him
truly
happy
turned
Harry
said
Hermione
suddenly
peering
over
his
shoulder
What
that
thing
outside
your
window
Harry
turned
look
outside
Something
very
small
and
gray
was
bobbing
and
out
sight
beyond
the
glass
stood
for
better
look
and
saw
that
was
tiny
owl
carrying
letter
that
was
much
too
big
for
The
owl
was
small
fact
that
kept
tumbling
over
the
air
buffeted
this
way
and
that
the
train
slipstream
Harry
quickly
pulled
down
the
window
stretched
out
his
arm
and
caught
felt
like
very
fluffy
Snitch
brought
carefully
inside
The
owl
dropped
its
letter
onto
Harry
seat
and
began
zooming
around
their
compartment
apparently
very
pleased
with
itself
for
accomplishing
its
task
Hedwig
clicked
her
beak
with
sort
dignified
disapproval
Crookshanks
sat
his
seat
following
the
owl
with
his
great
yellow
eyes
Ron
noticing
this
snatched
the
owl
safely
out
harm
way
Harry
picked
the
letter
was
addressed
him
ripped
open
the
letter
and
shouted
from
Sirius
What
said
Ron
and
Hermione
excitedly
Read
aloud
Dear
Harry
hope
this
finds
you
before
you
reach
your
aunt
and
uncle
don
know
whether
they
used
owl
post
Buckbeak
and
are
hiding
won
tell
you
where
case
this
owl
falls
into
the
wrong
hands
have
some
doubt
about
his
reliability
but
the
best
could
find
and
did
seem
eager
for
the
job
believe
the
dementors
are
still
searching
for
but
they
haven
hope
finding
here
planning
allow
some
Muggles
glimpse
soon
long
way
from
Hogwarts
that
the
security
the
castle
will
lifted
There
something
never
got
around
telling
you
during
our
brief
meeting
was
who
sent
you
the
Firebolt
said
Hermione
triumphantly
See
told
you
was
from
him
Yes
but
hadn
jinxed
had
said
Ron
Ouch
The
tiny
owl
now
hooting
happily
his
hand
had
nibbled
one
his
fingers
what
seemed
think
was
affectionate
way
Crookshanks
took
the
order
the
Owl
Office
for

your
name
but
told
them
take
the
gold
from

Gringotts
vault

birthdays
worth
presents
from
your
godfather

also
like
apologize
for
the
fright

gave
you
that
night
last
year
when
you
left
your
uncle
house
had
only
hoped
get
glimpse
you
before
starting
journey
north
but
think
the
sight
alarmed
you
enclosing
something
else
for
you
which
think
will
make
your
next
year
Hogwarts
more
enjoyable
ever
you
need
send
word
Your
owl
will
find
write
again
soon
Sirius
Harry
looked
eagerly
inside
the
envelope
There
was
another
piece
parchment
there
read
through
quickly
and
felt
suddenly
warm
and
contented
though

gulp
Sirius

Ron
and
Hermione

Harry
spotted
Uncle

Ron

after

Hermione
good

then
wheeled
the
trolley

and
Hedwig
