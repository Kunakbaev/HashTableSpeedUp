And

Sodom
and
Lot
saw
them
and
rose
meet
them
and
bowed
himself
with
his

said
Behold
now

turn
aside
pray
you
into
your
servant
house
and
tarry
all

and
wash
your
feet
and
shall
rise
early
and
your
way
And
they
said
Nay
but
will
abide
the
street
all
night
Genesis
And
urged
them
greatly
and
they
turned
unto
him
and
entered
into
his
house
and
made
them
feast
and
did
bake
unleavened
bread
and
they
did
eat
Genesis
But
before
they
lay
down
the
men
the
city
even
the
men
Sodom
compassed
the
house
round
both
young
and
old
all
the
people
from
every
quarter
Genesis
and
they
called
unto
Lot
and
said
unto
him
Where
are
the
men
that
came
thee
this
night
bring
them
out
unto
that
may
know
them
Genesis
And
Lot
went
out
unto
them
the
door
and
shut
the
door
after
him
Genesis
And
said
pray
you
brethren
not
wickedly
Genesis
Behold
now

two
daughters
that

let
pray
you
bring
them

unto
you
and
them
good

only
unto
these
men
nothing
forasmuch
they
are
come
under
the
shadow
roof
Genesis
And
they
said
Stand
back
And
they
said
This
one
fellow
came
sojourn
and
will
needs
judge
now
will
deal
worse
with
thee
than

them
And
they
pressed
sore
upon
the
man
even
Lot
and
drew
near
break
the
door
Genesis
But
the
men
put
forth
their
hand
and
brought
Lot
into
the
house
them
and
shut
the
door
Genesis
And
they
smote
the
men
that
were

door
the
house
with
blindness
both
small
and
great
that
they
wearied
themselves
find
the
door
Genesis
And
the
men
said
unto
Lot
Hast
thou
here
any
besides
son
law
and
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
and
whomsoever
thou
hast
the
city
bring
them
out
the
place
Genesis
for
will
destroy
this
place
because
the
cry
them
waxed
great
before
Jehovah
and
Jehovah
hath
sent

Genesis
And
Lot
went
out
and
spake
unto
his
sons
law
who
married
his
daughters
and
said
get
you
out
this
place
for
Jehovah
will
destroy
the
city
But
seemed
unto
his
sons
law
one
that
mocked
Genesis
And
when
the
morning
arose
then
the
angels
hastened
Lot
saying
Arise
take
thy
wife
and
thy
two
daughters
that
are
here
lest
thou
consumed
the
iniquity
the
city
Genesis
But
lingered
and
the
men
laid
hold
upon
his
hand
and
upon
the
hand
his
wife
and
upon
the
hand
his
two
daughters
Jehovah
being
merciful
unto
him
and
they
brought
him
forth
and
set
him
without
the
city
Genesis
And
came
pass
when
they
had
brought
them
forth
abroad
that
said
Escape
for
thy
life
look
not
behind
thee
neither
stay
thou
all
the
Plain
escape
the
mountain
lest
thou
consumed
Genesis
And
Lot
said
unto
them
not
lord
Genesis
behold
now
thy
servant
hath
found
favor
thy
sight
and
thou
hast
magnified
thy
lovingkindness
which
thou
hast
showed
unto
saving
life
and
cannot
escape
the
mountain
lest
evil
overtake
and
die
Genesis
behold
now
this
city
near
flee
unto
and
little
one
let
escape
thither
not
little
one
and
soul
shall
live
Genesis
And
said
unto
him
See

accepted
thee
concerning
this
thing
also
that

not
overthrow
the
city
which
thou
hast
spoken
Genesis
Haste
thee
escape
thither
for
cannot
anything
till

come
thither
Therefore
the
name
the
city
was
called
Zoar
Genesis
The
sun
was
risen
upon
the
earth
when
Lot
came
unto
Zoar
Genesis
Then
Jehovah
rained
upon
Sodom
and
upon
Gomorrah
brimstone
and
fire
from
Jehovah
out

Genesis
and
overthrew
those
cities
and
all
the
Plain
and
all
the
inhabitants
the
cities
and
that
which
grew
upon

ground
Genesis
But
his
wife
looked
back
from
behind
him
and
she
became
pillar
salt
Genesis
And
Abraham
gat
early
the
morning
the
place
where
had
stood
before
Jehovah
Genesis
and
looked
toward
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
and
toward
all
the
land
the
Plain
and
beheld
and
the
smoke
the
land
went

smoke
furnace
Genesis
And
came
pass
when
God
destroyed
the
cities
the
Plain
that
God
remembered
Abraham
and
sent
Lot
out
the
midst
the
overthrow
when
overthrew
the
cities

dwelt
Genesis
And
Lot
went
out

and
dwelt

mountain
and
his
two
daughters
with
him
for

Zoar
and
dwelt

and
his
two

Genesis
And
the
first
born
said
unto
the
younger

Genesis
come
let

Genesis
And
they
made
their
father
drink
wine
that
night
and
the
first
born
went
and
lay
with
her
father
and
knew
not
when
she
lay
down
nor
when
she
arose
Genesis
And
came
pass
the
morrow
that
the
first
born
said
unto
the
younger
Behold

let
make
him
drink

this
night
also
And

Genesis
And
they
made
their
father
drink
wine
that
night
also
and
the
younger
arose
and
lay
with
him
and
knew
not
when
she
lay
down
nor
when
she
arose
Genesis
Thus
were
both
the
daughters
Lot
with
child
their
father
Genesis
And
the
first
born
bare
son
and
called
his
name
Moab
the

Genesis
And

Genesis
And
Abraham
journeyed
from
thence
toward

the
South
and
dwelt
between

Genesis
And
Abraham
said
Sarah
his
wife
She
sister
and
Abimelech

took
Sarah
Genesis
But
God
came
Abimelech
dream
the
night
and
said
him
Behold
thou
art
but
dead
man
because
the
woman
whom
thou
hast
taken

wife
Genesis
Now
Abimelech
had
not
come
near
her
and
said
Lord

Genesis
Said

unto
She
sister
and
she
even
she
herself
said
brother
the
integrity

and
the
innocency
hands

Genesis
And
God
said
unto
him
the
dream
Yea

that
the
integrity
thy
heart
thou
has
done
this
and
also
withheld
thee
from

suffered

Now

shalt
live
and
thou
restore
her
not
know
thou
that
thou
shalt
surely
die
thou
and

Genesis
And
Abimelech
rose
early
the
morning
and
called
all
his
servants
and
told
all
these
things
their
ears
and
the
men
were
sore
afraid
Genesis
Then
Abimelech
called
Abraham

said
unto
him
What

done
deeds
unto

And
Abimelech
said
unto

thee
And

Genesis
And
came
pass
soon
Isaac
had
made
end
blessing
Jacob
and
Jacob
was
yet
scarce
gone
out
from
the
presence
Isaac
his
father
that
Esau
his
brother
came
from
his
hunting
Genesis
And
also
made
savory
food
and
brought
unto
his
father
and
said
unto
his
father
Let
father
arise
and
eat
his
son
venison
that
thy
soul
may
bless
Genesis
And
Isaac
his
father
said
unto
him
Who
art
thou
And
said
thy
son
thy
first
born
Esau
Genesis
And
Isaac
trembled
very
exceedingly
and
said
Who
then
that
hath
taken
venison
and
brought
and
have
eaten
all
before
thou
camest
and
have
blessed
him
yea
and

When
Esau
heard
the
words
his
father
cried
with
exceeding
great
and
bitter
cry
and
said
unto
his
father
Bless
even
also
father
Genesis
And
said
Thy
brother
came
with
guile
and
hath
taken
away
thy
blessing
Genesis
And
said
not
rightly
named
Jacob
for
hath
supplanted
these
two
times
took
away
birthright
and
behold
now
hath
taken
away
blessing
And
said
Hast
thou
not
reserved
blessing
for

And
Isaac
answered
and
said
unto
Esau
Behold
have
made
him
thy
lord
and
all
his
brethren
have
given
him
for
servants
and
with
grain
and
new
wine
have
sustained
him
and
what
then
shall
for
thee
son
Genesis
And
Esau
said
unto
his
father
Hast
thou
but
one
blessing
father
bless
even
also
father
And
Esau
lifted
his
voice
and
wept
Genesis
And
Isaac
his
father
answered
and
said
unto
him
Behold
the
fatness
the
earth
shall

dwelling
And
the
dew
heaven
from

Genesis
And
thy
sword
shalt
thou
live
and
thou
shalt
serve
thy
brother
And
shall
come
pass
when
thou
shalt
break
loose
That
thou
shalt
shake
his
yoke
from
off
thy
neck
Genesis
And
Esau
hated
Jacob
because
the
blessing
wherewith
his
father
blessed
him
and
Esau
said
his
heart
The
days
mourning
for
father
are
hand
then
will
slay
brother
Jacob
Genesis
And
the
words
Esau
her
elder
son
were
told

and
she
sent
and
called
Jacob
her
younger
son
and
said
unto
him
Behold
thy
brother
Esau
touching
thee
doth
comfort
himself
purposing
kill
thee
Genesis
Now
therefore
son

and
forget
that
which
thou
hast
done
him
then

fetch
thee
from
thence
why

bereaved
you
both

And

Now

was
gone

and
Rachel
stole
the

stole
away
unawares
Laban
the

not
that

with
all
that

and
rose
and
passed
over

set
his
face
toward
the

Gilead
Genesis
And
was
told
Laban
the
third
day
that
Jacob
was
fled
Genesis
And
took
his
brethren
with
him
and
pursued
after
him
seven
days
journey
and
overtook
him

Gilead
Genesis
And
God
came
Laban
the
Syrian
dream
the
night
and
said
unto
him
Take
heed
thyself
that
thou
speak
not
Jacob
either
good

Genesis
And
Laban
came
with
Jacob
Now
Jacob
had
pitched
his
tent
the
mountain
and
Laban
with
his
brethren
encamped
the
mountain
Gilead
Genesis
And
Laban
said
Jacob
What
hast
thou
done
that
thou
hast
stolen
away
unawares
and
carried
away
daughters
captives
the
sword
Genesis
Wherefore
didst
thou
flee
secretly
and
steal
away
from

didst
not
tell
that
might
have
sent
thee
away
with
mirth
and
with
songs
with
tabret
and
with
harp
Genesis
and
didst
not
suffer
kiss
sons
and
daughters
now
hast
thou
done
foolishly
Genesis
the
power
hand
you
hurt
but
the
God
your
father
spake
unto
yesternight
saying
Take
heed
thyself
that
thou
speak
not
Jacob
either
good
bad
Genesis
And
now
though
thou
wouldest
needs
gone
because
thou
sore
longedst
after
thy
father
house
yet
wherefore
hast
thou
stolen
gods
Genesis
And
Jacob
answered
and
said
Laban
Because
was
afraid
for
said
Lest
thou
shouldest
take
thy
daughters
from
force
Genesis
With
whomsoever
thou
findest
thy
gods
shall
not
live
before
our
brethren
discern
thou
what
thine
with
and
take
thee
For
Jacob
knew
not
that
Rachel
had
stolen
them
Genesis
And
Laban
went
into
Jacob
tent
and
into
Leah
tent
and
into
the

but
found
them
not
And
went

Now
Rachel
had
taken

put
them

sat
upon
them
And
Laban
felt
about
all
the

And
searched
but
found
not
the
teraphim
Genesis
And
Jacob
was
wroth
and
chode
with
Laban
and
Jacob
answered
and
said
Laban
What
trespass
what
sin
that
thou
hast
hotly
pursued
after
Genesis
Whereas
thou
hast
felt
about
all
stuff
what
hast
thou
found
all

Set

These

And
Laban
answered
and
said
unto
Jacob
The

Genesis
And
Jehovah
was
with
Joseph
and
was
prosperous
man
and
was

Genesis
And
his
master
saw
that
Jehovah
was
with
him
and
that
Jehovah
made
all
that

hand
Genesis
And
Joseph
found
favor
his
sight
and
ministered
unto
him
and
made
him
overseer
over
his
house
and
all
that

Genesis
And

and
over
all

Jehovah
blessed
the
Egyptian
house
for
Joseph
sake
and
the
blessing
Jehovah
was
upon

And
left
all
that

not
aught
that

with
him
save
the
bread
which

was
comely
and
well
favored

And

after
these
things
that
his
master
wife
cast
her
eyes
upon
Joseph
and
she
said
Lie
with

But
refused
and
said
unto
his
master
wife
Behold
master
knoweth
not
what
with
the
house
and
hath
put
all
that

into
hand
Genesis
not
greater
this
house
than
neither
hath
kept
back
anything
from
but
thee
because
thou
art
his
wife
how
then
can
this
great
wickedness
and
sin
against
God
Genesis
And
came
pass
she
spake
Joseph
day
day
that
hearkened
not
unto
her
lie
her
with
her
Genesis
And
came
pass
about
this
time
that
went
into
the
house
his
work
and
there
was
none
the
men
the
house
there
within
Genesis
And
she
caught
him
his
garment
saying
Lie
with
and
left
his
garment
her
hand
and
fled
and
got
him
out
Genesis
And
came
pass
when
she
saw
that
had
left
his
garment
her
hand
and
was
fled
forth
Genesis
that
she
called
unto
the
men
her
house
and
spake
unto
them
saying
See

brought
Hebrew
unto
mock
came
unto
lie
with

cried
with
loud
voice
Genesis
and
came
pass
when

that
lifted
voice
and
cried
that
left
his
garment
and
fled
and
got
him
out
Genesis
And
she
laid
his
garment
her
until
his
master
came
home
Genesis
And
she
spake
unto
him
according
these
words
saying
The
Hebrew
servant
whom
thou
hast
brought
unto
came
unto
mock
Genesis
and
came
pass
lifted
voice
and
cried
that
left
his
garment
and
fled
out
Genesis
And
came
pass
when
his
master
heard
the
words
his
wife
which
she
spake
unto
him
saying
After
this
manner
did
thy
servant
that
his
wrath
was
kindled
Genesis
And
Joseph
master
took
him
and
put
him
into
the
prison
the
place
where
the
king
prisoners
were
bound
and
was
there
the
prison
Genesis
But
Jehovah
was
with
Joseph
and
showed
kindness
unto
him
and
gave
him
favor
the
sight
the
keeper
the
prison
Genesis
And
the
keeper
the
prison
committed
Joseph
hand
all
the
prisoners
that
were
the
prison
and
whatsoever
they
did
there
was
the
doer
Genesis
The
keeper
the
prison
looked
not
anything
that
was
under
his
hand
because
Jehovah
was
with
him
and
that
which
did
Jehovah
made
prosper
Genesis
And
came
pass
after
these
things
that
the
butler
the
king
Egypt
and
his
baker
offended
their
lord
the
king
Egypt
Genesis
And
Pharaoh
was
wroth
against
his
two
officers
against
the
chief
the
butlers
and
against
the
chief
the
bakers
Genesis
And
put
them
ward
the
house
the
captain
the
guard
into
the
prison
the
place
where
Joseph
was
bound
Genesis
And
the
captain
the
guard
charged
Joseph
with
them
and
ministered
unto
them
and
they
continued
season
ward
Genesis
And
they
dreamed
dream
both
them
each
man
his
dream
one
night
each
man
according
the
interpretation
his
dream
the
butler
and
the
baker
the
king
Egypt
who
were
bound
the
prison
Genesis
And
Joseph
came
unto
them
the
morning
and
saw
them
and
behold
they
were
sad
Genesis
And
asked
Pharaoh
officers
that
were
with
him
ward
his
master
house
saying
Wherefore
look
sad
day
Genesis
And
they
said
unto
him
have
dreamed
dream
and
there
none
that
can
interpret
And
Joseph
said
unto
them
not
interpretations
belong
God
tell
pray
you
Genesis
And
the
chief
butler
told
his
dream
Joseph
and
said
him
dream
behold
vine
was
before
Genesis
and
the
vine
were
three
branches
and
was
though
budded
and
its
blossoms
shot
forth
and
the
clusters
thereof
brought
forth
ripe
grapes
Genesis
and
Pharaoh
cup
was
hand
and
took
the
grapes
and
pressed
them
into
Pharaoh
cup
and
gave
the
cup
into
Pharaoh
hand
Genesis
And
Joseph
said
unto
him
This
the
interpretation
the
three
branches
are
three
days
Genesis
within
yet
three
days
shall
Pharaoh
lift
thy
head
and
restore
thee
unto
thine
office
and
thou
shalt
give
Pharaoh
cup
into
his
hand
after
the
former
manner
when
thou
wast
his
butler
Genesis
But
have
thy
remembrance
when
shall
well
with
thee
and
show
kindness
pray
thee
unto
and
make
mention
unto
Pharaoh
and
bring
out
this
house
Genesis
for
indeed
was
stolen
away
out
the
land
the
Hebrews
and
here
also
have
done
nothing
that
they
should
put
into
the
dungeon
Genesis
When
the
chief
baker
saw
that
the
interpretation
was
good
said
unto
Joseph
also
was
dream
and
behold
three
baskets
white
bread
were

Genesis
and
the
uppermost
basket
there
was
all
manner
baked
food
for
Pharaoh
and
the
birds
did
eat
them
out
the
basket
upon
head
Genesis
And
Joseph
answered
and
said
This
the
interpretation
thereof
the
three
baskets
are
three
days
Genesis
within
yet
three
days
shall
Pharaoh
lift
thy
head
from
off
thee
and
shall
hang
thee
tree
and
the
birds
shall
eat
thy
flesh
from
off
thee
Genesis
And
came
pass
the
third
day
which
was
Pharaoh
birthday
that
made
feast
unto
all
his
servants
and
lifted
the
head
the
chief
butler
and
the
head
the
chief
baker
among
his
servants
Genesis
And
restored
the
chief
butler
unto
his
butlership
again
and
gave
the
cup
into
Pharaoh
hand
Genesis
but
hanged
the
chief
baker
Joseph
had
interpreted
them
Genesis
Yet
did
not
the
chief
butler
remember
Joseph
but
forgat
him
Genesis
And
came
pass
the
end
two
full
years
that
Pharaoh
dreamed
and
behold
stood
the
river
Genesis
And
behold
there
came
out

Genesis
And
behold
seven
other

came
after
them
out
the
river
ill
favored
and
lean
fleshed
and
stood
the
other
kine
upon
the
brink
the
river
Genesis
And
the
ill
favored
and
lean
fleshed
kine
did
eat
the
seven
well
favored
and
fat
kine
Pharaoh
awoke
Genesis
And
slept
and
dreamed
second
time
and
behold
seven
ears
grain
came
upon
one
stalk
rank
and
good
Genesis
And
behold
seven
ears
thin
and
blasted
with
the
east
wind
sprung
after
them
Genesis
And
the
thin
ears
swallowed
the
seven
rank
and
full
ears
And
Pharaoh
awoke
and
behold
was
dream
Genesis
And
came
pass
the
morning
that
his
spirit
was
troubled
and
sent
and
called
for
all
the
magicians
Egypt
and
all
the
wise
men
thereof
and
Pharaoh
told
them
his
dream
but
there
was
none
that
could
interpret
them
unto
Pharaoh
Genesis
Then
spake
the
chief
butler
unto
Pharaoh
saying
remember
faults
this
day
Genesis
Pharaoh
was
wroth
with
his
servants
and
put
ward
the
house
the
captain
the
guard
and
the
chief
baker
Genesis
and
dreamed
dream
one
night
and
dreamed
each

And
there
was
with
there
young

Hebrew
servant
the

each
man
according

did
interpret
Genesis
And

Genesis
Then
Pharaoh
sent
and
called
Joseph
and
they
brought
him
hastily
out
the
dungeon
and
shaved
himself
and
changed
his
raiment
and
came
unto
Pharaoh
Genesis
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
Joseph
have
dreamed
dream
and
there
none
that
can
interpret
and
have
heard
say
thee
that
when
thou
hearest
dream
thou
canst
interpret
Genesis
And
Joseph
answered
Pharaoh
saying
not
God
will
give
Pharaoh
answer
peace
Genesis
And
Pharaoh
spake
unto
Joseph
dream
behold
stood
upon
the
brink
the
river
Genesis
and
behold
there
came
out
the
river
seven
kine
fat
fleshed
and
well
favored
and
they
fed
the
reed
grass
Genesis
and
behold
seven
other
kine
came
after
them
poor
and
very
ill
favored
and
lean
fleshed
such

all
the
land
Egypt
for
badness
Genesis
and
the

Genesis
and
when
they
had
eaten
them
could

that
they
had
eaten
them
but
they
were
still
ill
favored
the
beginning
awoke
Genesis
And
saw
dream
and
behold
seven
ears
came
upon
one
stalk
full
and
good
Genesis
and
behold
seven
ears
withered
thin
and
blasted
with
the
east
wind
sprung
after
them
Genesis
and
the
thin
ears
swallowed
the
seven
good
ears
and
told
unto
the
magicians
but
there
was
none
that
could
declare
Genesis
And
Joseph
said
unto
Pharaoh
The
dream
Pharaoh
one
what
God
about
hath
declared
unto
Pharaoh
Genesis
The
seven
good
kine
are
seven
years
and
the
seven
good
ears
are
seven
years
the
dream
one
Genesis
And
the
seven
lean
and
ill
favored
kine
that
came
after
them
are
seven
years
and
also
the
seven
empty
ears
blasted
with
the
east
wind
they
shall

years
famine
Genesis
That
the
thing
which
spake
unto
Pharaoh
what
God
about
hath
showed
unto
Pharaoh
Genesis
Behold
there
come
seven
years
great
plenty
throughout
all
the
land
Egypt
Genesis
and
there
shall
arise
after
them
seven
years
famine
and
all
the
plenty
shall
forgotten
the
land
Egypt
and
the
famine
shall
consume
the
land
Genesis
and
the
plenty
shall
not
known
the
land
reason
that
famine
which
followeth
for
shall
very
grievous
Genesis
And
for
that
the
dream
was
doubled
unto
Pharaoh
because
the
thing
established
God
and
God
will
shortly
bring
pass
Genesis
Now
therefore
let
Pharaoh
look
out
man
discreet
and
wise
and
set
him
over
the
land
Egypt
Genesis
Let
Pharaoh
this
and
let
him
appoint
overseers
over
the
land
and
take
the
fifth
part
the
land
Egypt
the
seven
plenteous
years
Genesis
And
let
them
gather
all
the
food
these
good
years
that
come
and
lay
grain
under
the
hand
Pharaoh
for
food
the
cities
and
let

keep
Genesis
And
the
food

for
store
the
land
against
the
seven
years
famine
which
shall
the
land
Egypt
that
the
land
perish
not
through
the
famine
Genesis
And
the
thing
was
good
the
eyes
Pharaoh
and
the
eyes
all
his
servants
Genesis
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
his
servants
Can
find
such
one
this
man
whom
the
spirit
God
Genesis
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
Joseph
Forasmuch
God
hath
showed
thee
all
this
there
none
discreet
and
wise
thou
Genesis
thou
shalt
over
house
and
according
unto
thy
word
shall

throne
will

Genesis
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
Joseph
See
have
set
thee
over
all
the
land
Egypt
Genesis
And
Pharaoh
took
off
his

ring
from
his

and
arrayed
him
vestures

linen
and
put

and
made

they
cried
before
him
Bow

and
set
him
over
all
the

Egypt
Genesis
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
Joseph
Pharaoh
and
without
thee
shall
man
lift
his
hand
his
foot
all
the
land
Egypt
Genesis
And
Pharaoh
called
Joseph
name
Zaphenath
paneah
and
gave
him
wife
Asenath
the
daughter
Poti
phera
priest
And
Joseph
went
out
over
the
land
Egypt
Genesis
And
Joseph
was
thirty
years
old
when
stood
before
Pharaoh
king
Egypt
And
Joseph
went
out
from
the
presence
Pharaoh
and
went
throughout
all
the
land
Egypt
Genesis
And
the
seven
plenteous
years
the
earth
brought
forth
handfuls
Genesis
And
gathered
all
the
food
the
seven
years
which
were
the
land
Egypt
and
laid
the
food
the
cities
the
food
the
field
which
was
round
about
every
city
laid
the
same
Genesis
And
Joseph
laid
grain
the
sand
the
sea
very
much
until
left
off
numbering
for
was
without
number
Genesis
And
unto
Joseph
were
born
two
sons
before
the
year
famine
came
whom
Asenath
the
daughter
Potiphera
priest
bare
unto
him
Genesis
And
Joseph
called
the
name
the
first
born
Manasseh
For
said
God
hath
made
forget
all
toil
and
all
father
house
Genesis
And
the
name
the
second
called
Ephraim
For
God
hath
made
fruitful
the
land
affliction
Genesis
And
the
seven
years
plenty
that
was
the
land
Egypt
came
end
Genesis
And
the
seven
years
famine
began
come
according
Joseph
had
said
and
there
was
famine
all
lands
but
all
the
land
Egypt
there
was
bread
Genesis
And
when
all
the
land
Egypt
was
famished
the
people
cried
Pharaoh
for
bread

And
they
knew
not

and
their
heart
failed
them
and
they
turned
trembling
one
another
saying
What
this
that
God
hath
done
unto

And
they
came
unto
Jacob
their
father
unto
the

Canaan
and
told
him
all

befallen
them
saying
Genesis
The

And
they
made
ready
the
present
against

And
when
Joseph
came
home
they
brought
him
the
present
which
was
their

into
the
house
and
bowed
down
themselves
him
the
earth
Genesis
And
asked
them
their
welfare
and
said
your

well
the

said
Thy

this
your
youngest
brother

said
God
gracious
unto
thee
son

And
Joseph
made
haste
for
his
heart
yearned
over
his
brother
and
sought
where
weep
and
entered
into
his
chamber
and
wept
there
Genesis
And
washed
his
face
and
came
out
and
refrained
himself
and
said
Set
bread
Genesis
And
they
set
for
him
himself
and
for
them
themselves
and
for
the
Egyptians
that
did
eat
with
him
themselves
because
the
Egyptians
might
not
eat
bread
with
the
Hebrews
for
that
abomination
unto
the
Egyptians
Genesis
And
they
sat
before
him
the
first
born
according
his
birthright
and
the
youngest
according
his
youth
and
the
men
marvelled
one
with
another
Genesis
And
took
and
sent
messes
unto
them
from
before
him
but
Benjamin
mess
was
five
times
much
any
theirs
And
they
drank
and
were
merry
with
him
Genesis
And
commanded
the
steward
his
house
saying
Fill
the
men
sacks
with
food
much
they
can
carry
and
put
every
man
money

And
put

according
the
word
that
Joseph
had
spoken
Genesis
soon
the
morning
was
light
the
men
were
sent
away
they
and
their
asses
Genesis
And
when
they
were
gone
out
the
city
and
were
not
yet
far
off
Joseph
said
unto
his
steward
follow
after
the
men
and
when
thou
dost
overtake
them
say
unto
them
Wherefore

rewarded
evil
for
good
Genesis
not
this
that
which
lord
drinketh
and
whereby

done
evil
doing
Genesis
And
overtook
them
and
spake
unto
them
these
words
Genesis
And
they
said
unto
him
Wherefore
speaketh
lord
such
words
these
Far
from
thy
servants
that
they
should
such
thing
Genesis
Behold
the
money
which
found
our
sacks
mouths
brought
again
unto
thee
out
the
land
Canaan
how
then
should
steal
out
thy
lord
house
silver
gold
Genesis
With
whomsoever
thy
servants
found
let
him
die
and
also
will
lord
bondmen
Genesis
And
said
Now
also
let
according
unto
your
words
with
whom

shall
bondman
and
shall
blameless
Genesis
Then
they
hasted
and
took
down
every
man
his
sack
the
ground
and
opened
every
man
his
sack
Genesis
And
searched
and
began
the
eldest
and
left
off
the
youngest
and
the
cup
was
found
Benjamin
sack
Genesis
Then
they
rent
their
clothes
and
laded
every
man
his
ass
and
returned
the
city
Genesis
And
Judah
and
his
brethren
came
Joseph
house
and
was
yet
there
and
they
fell
before
him
the
ground
Genesis
And
Joseph
said
unto
them
What
deed
this
that
have
done
know
not
that
such
man
can
indeed
divine
Genesis
And
Judah
said
What
shall
say
unto
lord
what
shall
speak
how
shall
clear
ourselves
God
hath
found
out
the
iniquity
thy
servants
behold
are
lord
bondmen
both
and
also
whose
hand
the
cup
found
Genesis
And
said
Far
from
that
should
the
man
whose
hand
the
cup
found
shall
bondman
but
for
you
get
you
peace
unto
your
father
Genesis
Then
Judah
came
near
unto
him
and
said
lord
let
thy
servant
pray
thee
speak
word
lord
ears
and
let
not
thine
anger
burn
against
thy
servant
for
thou
art
even
Pharaoh
Genesis
lord
asked
his
servants
saying
Have
father
brother
Genesis
And
said
unto
lord
have
father
old
man
and
child
his
old
age
little
one
and
his
brother
dead
and
alone
left
his
mother
and
his
father
loveth
him
Genesis
And
thou
saidst
unto
thy
servants
Bring
him
down
unto
that
may
set
mine
eyes
upon
him
Genesis
And
said
unto
lord
The
lad
cannot
leave
his
father
for
should
leave
his
father
his
father
would
die
Genesis
And
thou
saidst
unto
thy
servants
Except
your
youngest
brother
come
down
with
you
shall
see
face
more
Genesis
And
came
pass
when
came
unto
thy
servant
father
told
him
the
words
lord
Genesis
And
our
father
said
again
buy
little
food
Genesis
And
said
cannot
down
our
youngest
brother
with
then
will
down
for
may
not
see
the
man
face
except
our
youngest
brother
with
Genesis
And
thy
servant
father
said
unto
know
that
wife
bare
two
sons
Genesis
and
the
one
went
out
from
and
said
Surely
torn
pieces
and
have
not
seen
him
since
Genesis
and
take
this
one
also
from
and
harm
befall
him
will
bring
down
gray
hairs
with
sorrow
Sheol
Genesis
Now
therefore
when
come
thy
servant
father
and
the
lad
not
with
seeing
that
his
life
bound
the
lad
life
Genesis
will
come
pass
when
seeth
that
the
lad
not
with
that
will
die
and
thy
servants
will
bring
down
the
gray
hairs
thy
servant
our
father
with
sorrow
Sheol
Genesis
For
thy
servant
became
surety
for
the
lad
unto
father
saying
bring
him
not
unto
thee
then
shall
bear
the
blame
father
for
ever
Genesis
Now
therefore
let
thy
servant
pray
thee
abide
instead
the
lad
bondman
lord
and
let
the
lad

his
brethren
Genesis
For
how
shall
father

see
the
evil
that

Genesis
Then
Joseph
could
not
refrain
himself
before
all
them
that
stood
before
him
and
cried
Cause
every
man
out
from

there
stood

Joseph
made
himself
known
unto
his
brethren

And
wept
aloud
and
the
Egyptians
heard
and
the
house
Pharaoh
heard
Genesis
And
Joseph
said
unto
his
brethren
Joseph
doth
father
yet
live
And
his
brethren
could
not
answer
him
for
they
were
troubled
his
presence
Genesis
And
Joseph
said
unto
his
brethren
Come
near
pray
you
And
they
came
near
And
said
Joseph
your
brother
whom
sold
into
Egypt
Genesis
And
now
not
grieved
nor
angry
with
yourselves
that
sold
hither
for

For
these

years
hath
the
famine
been
the
land

And
God
sent
before
you
preserve
you
remnant
the
earth

save
you
alive
great
deliverance

now
was
not
you
that

Haste

And
fell
upon

Genesis
Joseph
died

Now
these
are
the
names
the

every

Exodus
Reuben
Simeon

Dan
and

Exodus
And
all
the
souls
that
came
out
the

Jacob
were
seventy
souls
and
Joseph
was
Egypt
already
Exodus
And
Joseph
died
and
all
his
brethren
and
all
that
generation
Exodus
And
the
children
Israel
were
fruitful
and
increased
abundantly
and
multiplied
and
waxed
exceeding
mighty
and
the
land
was
filled
with
them
Exodus
Now
there
arose
new
king
over
Egypt
who
knew
not
Joseph
Exodus
And
said
unto
his
people
Behold
the
people
the
children
Israel
are
more
and
mightier
than
Exodus
come
let
deal
wisely
with
them
lest
they
multiply
and
come
pass
that
when
there
falleth
out
any
war
they
also
join
themselves
unto
our
enemies
and
fight
against
and
get
them
out
the
land
Exodus
Therefore
they
did
set
over
them
taskmasters
afflict
them
with
their
burdens
And
they
built
for
Pharaoh
store
cities
Pithom
and
Raamses
Exodus
But
the
more
they
afflicted
them
the
more
they
multiplied
and
the
more
they
spread
abroad
And
they
were
grieved
because
the
children
Israel
Exodus
And
the
Egyptians
made
the
children
Israel
serve
with
rigor
Exodus
and
they
made
their
lives
bitter
with
hard
service
mortar
and
brick
and
all
manner
service
the
field
all
their
service
wherein
they
made
them
serve
with
rigor
Exodus
And
the
king
Egypt
spake
the
Hebrew
midwives
whom
the
name
the
one
was
Shiphrah
and
the
name
the
other
Puah
Exodus
and
said
When

the
Hebrew
women
and
see
them
upon
the
birth
stool
son
then
shall
kill
him
but
daughter
then
she
shall
live
Exodus
But
the
midwives
feared
God
and
did
not
the
king
Egypt
commanded
them
but
saved
the
men
children
alive
Exodus
And
the
king
Egypt
called
for
the
midwives
and
said
unto
them
Why
have
done
this
thing
and
have
saved
the
men
children
alive
Exodus
And
the
midwives
said
unto
Pharaoh
Because
the
Hebrew
women
are
not
the
Egyptian
women
for
they
are
lively
and
are
delivered
ere
the
midwife
come
unto
them
Exodus
And
God
dealt
well
with
the
midwives
and
the
people
multiplied
and
waxed
very
mighty
Exodus
And
came
pass
because
the
midwives
feared
God
that
made
them
households
Exodus
And
Pharaoh
charged
all
his
people
saying
Every
son
that
born
shall
cast
into
the
river
and
every
daughter
shall
save
alive
Exodus
And
there
went
man
the
house
Levi
and
took
wife
daughter
Levi
Exodus
And
the
woman
conceived
and
bare
son
and
when
she
saw
him
that
was
goodly
child
she
hid
him
three
months
Exodus
And
when
she
could
not
longer
hide
him
she
took
for
him
ark
bulrushes
and
daubed
with
slime
and
with
pitch
and
she
put
the
child
therein
and
laid
the
flags
the
river
brink
Exodus
And
his
sister
stood
afar
off
know
what
would
done
him
Exodus
And
the
daughter
Pharaoh
came
down
bathe
the
river
and
her
maidens
walked
along
the
river
side
and
she
saw
the
ark
among
the
flags
and
sent
her
handmaid
fetch
Exodus
And
she
opened
and
saw
the
child
and
behold
the
babe
wept
And
she
had
compassion
him
and
said
This
one
the
Hebrews
children
Exodus
Then
said
his
sister
Pharaoh
daughter
Shall
and
call
thee
nurse
the
Hebrew
women
that
she
may
nurse
the
child
for
thee
Exodus
And
Pharaoh
daughter
said
her
And
the
maiden
went
and
called
the
child
mother
Exodus
And
Pharaoh
daughter
said
unto
her
Take
this
child
away
and
nurse
for
and
will
give
thee
thy
wages
And
the
woman
took
the
child
and
nursed
Exodus
And
the
child
grew
and
she
brought
him
unto
Pharaoh
daughter
and
became
her
son
And
she
called
his
name
Moses
and
said
Because
drew
him
out
the
water
Exodus
And
came
pass
those
days
when
Moses
was
grown
that
went
out
unto
his
brethren
and
looked
their
burdens
and
saw
Egyptian
smiting
Hebrew
one
his
brethren
Exodus
And
looked
this
way
and
that
way
and
when
saw
that
there
was
man
smote
the
Egyptian
and
hid
him
the
sand
Exodus
And
went
out
the
second
day
and
behold
two
men
the
Hebrews
were
striving
together
and
said
him
that
did
the
wrong
Wherefore
smitest
thou
thy
fellow
Exodus
And
said
Who
made
thee
prince
and
judge
over
thinkest
thou
kill
thou
killedst
the
Egyptian
And
Moses
feared
and
said
Surely
the
thing
known
Exodus
Now
when
Pharaoh
heard
this
thing
sought
slay
Moses
But
Moses
fled
from
the
face
Pharaoh
and
dwelt
the
land
Midian
and
sat
down
well
Exodus
Now
the
priest
Midian
had
seven
daughters
and
they
came
and
drew
water
and
filled
the
troughs
water
their
father
flock
Exodus
And
the
shepherds
came
and
drove
them
away
but
Moses
stood
and
helped
them
and
watered
their
flock
Exodus
And
when
they
came
Reuel
their
father
said
How

Exodus
And
they
said
Egyptian

Exodus
And
said
unto
his
daughters
And
where
why
that
have
left
the
man
call
him
that

eat
bread
Exodus
And
Moses
was
content
dwell
with
the
man
and
gave
Moses
Zipporah
his
daughter
Exodus
And
she
bare
son
and
called
his
name
Gershom
for

And

the
course
those
many
days
that

and
the
children
Israel
sighed
reason

bondage
and
they
cried
and
their
cry
came
unto

the
bondage
Exodus
And
God
heard
their
groaning
and
God
remembered
his
covenant
with
Abraham
with
Isaac
and
with
Jacob
Exodus
And
God
saw
the
children
Israel
and
God
took
knowledge
them
Exodus
Now
Moses
was
keeping
the
flock
Jethro

and
led
the
flock

And

And

Moreover
said
the
God

God
Abraham
the

And
Moses
hid
his
face
for

And

And

And
the
anger
Jehovah
was
kindled
against
Moses
and
said

And
the
people
believed
and
when
they
heard

Jehovah
had
visited
the
children
Israel
and
that

seen
their
affliction
then
they
bowed
their
heads
and
worshipped
Exodus
And
afterward
Moses
and
Aaron
came
and
said
unto
Pharaoh
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Let
people
that
they
may
hold
feast
unto
the
wilderness
Exodus
And
Pharaoh
said
Who
Jehovah
that
should
hearken
unto
his
voice
let
Israel
know
not
Jehovah
and
moreover
will
not
let
Israel

days
journey

Jehovah
our
God
lest

Exodus
And
the
king
Egypt
said
unto
them
Wherefore
Moses
and
Aaron
loose
the
people
from
their
works
get
you
unto
your
burdens
Exodus
And
Pharaoh
said
Behold
the
people
the
land
are
now
many
and
make
them
rest
from
their
burdens
Exodus
And
the
same
day
Pharaoh
commanded
the
taskmasters
the
people
and
their
officers
saying
Exodus
shall
more
give
the
people
straw
make
brick
heretofore
let
them
and
gather
straw
for
themselves
Exodus
And
the
number
the
bricks
which
they
did
make
heretofore
shall
lay
upon
them
shall
not
diminish
aught
thereof
for
they
are
idle
therefore
they
cry
saying
Let

sacrifice
our
God
Exodus
Let
heavier
work

upon
the
men
that
they
may
labor
therein
and
let
them
not
regard

And
the
taskmasters
the
people
went
out
and
their

they
spake
the
people
saying

for
straw
Exodus
And
the
taskmasters
were
urgent
saying
Fulfil
your
works
your
daily
tasks
when
there
was
straw
Exodus
And
the
officers
the
children
Israel
whom
Pharaoh
taskmasters
had
set
over
them
were
beaten
and
demanded
Wherefore
have
not
fulfilled
your
task
both
yesterday
and
day
making
brick
heretofore
Exodus
Then
the
officers
the
children
Israel
came
and
cried
unto
Pharaoh
saying
Wherefore
dealest
thou
thus
with
thy
servants
Exodus
There
straw

unto
thy
servants

they
say
Make

did
see
that
they
were
evil
case
when
was
said

diminish
aught
from
your
bricks
your
daily
tasks
Exodus
And
they
met
Moses
and
Aaron
who
stood
the
way
they
came
forth
from
Pharaoh
Exodus
and
they
said
unto
them
Jehovah
look
upon
you
and
judge
because

made
our
savor
abhorred
the

Pharaoh
and
the
eyes

And
Moses
returned
unto
Jehovah
and
said
Lord
wherefore
hast
thou
dealt
ill
with
this
people
why
that
thou
hast
sent

For
since
came
Pharaoh
speak
thy
name
hath
dealt
ill
with
this
people
neither
hast
thou
delivered
thy
people
all
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Now

thou
see
what
will
Pharaoh
for
strong
hand
shall
let
them
and
strong
hand
shall
drive
them
out

the

stank
Exodus
But
when
Pharaoh
saw
that
there
was
respite
hardened
his
heart
and
hearkened
not
unto
them
Jehovah
had
spoken
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Say
unto
Aaron
Stretch
out
thy
rod
and
smite
the
dust
the
earth
that

become
lice
throughout
all
the

Egypt
Exodus
And
they
did
and
Aaron
stretched
out
his
hand
with
his
rod
and
smote
the
dust
the
earth
and
there
were
lice
upon
man
and
upon
beast
all
the
dust
the
earth
became
lice
throughout
all
the
land
Egypt
Exodus
And
the
magicians
did
with
their
enchantments
bring
forth
lice
but
they
could
not
and
there
were
lice
upon
man
and
upon
beast
Exodus
Then
the
magicians
said
unto
Pharaoh
This
the
finger
God
and
Pharaoh
heart
was
hardened
and
hearkened
not
unto
them
Jehovah
had
spoken
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Rise
early
the
morning
and
stand
before
Pharaoh
cometh
forth
the
water
and
say
unto
him
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Let

Else

And

And

And
Jehovah
did
and
there
came
grievous
swarms
flies
into
the
house
Pharaoh
and
into
his
servants
houses
and
all
the
land
Egypt
the
land
was
corrupted
reason
the
swarms

Exodus
And
Pharaoh
called
for
Moses
and
for
Aaron
and
said
sacrifice
your
God
the
land
Exodus
And
Moses
said
not
meet
for

Jehovah
our
God

Exodus
will
three
days
journey

And
Pharaoh
said
will
let
you
that

sacrifice
Jehovah
your
God
the
wilderness
only
shall
not
very
far
away
entreat
for

And
Moses
said
Behold
out
from
thee
and
will
entreat
Jehovah
that
the
swarms
flies
may
depart
from
Pharaoh
from
his
servants
and
from
his
people
morrow
only
let
not
Pharaoh
deal
deceitfully
any
more
not
letting
the
people
sacrifice
Jehovah
Exodus
And
Moses
went
out
from
Pharaoh
and
entreated
Jehovah
Exodus
And
Jehovah
did
according
the
word
Moses
and
removed
the
swarms
flies
from
Pharaoh
from
his
servants
and
from
his
people
there
remained
not
one
Exodus
And
Pharaoh
hardened
his
heart
this
time
also
and
did
not
let
the
people
Exodus
Then
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
unto
Pharaoh
and
tell
him
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
the
Hebrews
Let

they
may
serve
Exodus
For
thou
refuse
let
them

wilt
hold
them
still
Exodus
behold
the
hand
Jehovah
upon
thy
cattle
which
are
the
field
upon
the
horses
upon
the
asses
upon
the
camels
upon
the
herds
and
upon
the
flocks
there
shall
very
grievous
murrain
Exodus
And
Jehovah
shall
make
distinction
between
the
cattle
Israel
and
the
cattle
Egypt
and
there
shall
nothing
die
all
that
belongeth
the
children
Israel
Exodus
And
Jehovah
appointed
set
time
saying
morrow
Jehovah
shall
this
thing

land
Exodus
And
Jehovah
did
that
thing
the
morrow
and
all
the
cattle
Egypt
died
but
the
cattle
the
children
Israel
died
not
one
Exodus
And
Pharaoh
sent
and
behold
there
was
not
much
one
the
cattle
the
Israelites
dead
But
the
heart
Pharaoh
was
stubborn
and
did
not
let
the
people
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
and
unto
Aaron
Take
you
handfuls
ashes
the
furnace
and
let
Moses
sprinkle
toward
heaven
the
sight
Pharaoh
Exodus
And
shall
become
small
dust
over
all
the
land
Egypt
and
shall
boil
breaking
forth
with
blains
upon
man
and
upon
beast
throughout
all
the
land
Egypt
Exodus
And
they
took
ashes
the
furnace
and
stood
before
Pharaoh
and
Moses
sprinkled
toward
heaven
and
became
boil
breaking
forth
with
blains
upon
man
and
upon

Exodus
And
the
magicians
could
not
stand
before
Moses
because
the
boils
for
the
boils
were
upon
the
magicians
and
upon
all
the
Egyptians
Exodus
And
Jehovah
hardened
the
heart
Pharaoh
and
hearkened
not
unto
them
Jehovah
had
spoken
unto
Moses
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Rise
early
the
morning
and
stand
before
Pharaoh
and
say
unto
him
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
the
Hebrews
Let
people
that
they
may
serve
Exodus
For
will
this
time
send
all
plagues
upon
thy
heart
and
upon
thy
servants
and
upon
thy
people
that
thou
mayest
know
that
there

like
all
the
earth
Exodus
For
now

put
forth
hand
and
smitten
thee
and
thy
people
with
pestilence
and
thou
hadst
been
cut
off
from
the
earth
Exodus
but
very
deed
for
this
cause
have
made
thee
stand
show
thee
power
and
that
name
may
declared
throughout
all
the
earth
Exodus
yet
exaltest
thou
thyself
against

that
thou

Behold

very
grievous

Now
therefore

found
the
field
and

not
brought
home
the
hail
shall
come
down
upon
them
and
they
shall
die
Exodus
that
feared
the
word
Jehovah
among
the
servants
Pharaoh
made
his
servants
and
his
cattle
flee
into
the
houses
Exodus
and
that
regarded
not
the
word
Jehovah
left
his
servants
and
his
cattle
the
field
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Stretch
forth
thy
hand
toward
heaven
that
there
may
hail
all
the
land
Egypt
upon
man
and
upon
beast
and
upon
every
herb
the
field
throughout
the
land
Egypt
Exodus
And
Moses
stretched
forth
his
rod
toward
heaven
and
Jehovah
sent
thunder
and
hail
and
fire
ran
down
unto
the
earth
and
Jehovah
rained
hail
upon
the
land
Egypt
Exodus
there
was
hail
and
fire
mingled
with
the
hail
very
grievous
such
had
not
been
all
the
land
Egypt
since
became
nation
Exodus
And
the
hail
smote
throughout
all
the
land
Egypt
all
that
was
the
field
both
man
and
beast
and
the
hail
smote
every
herb
the
field
and
brake
every
tree
the
field
Exodus
Only
the
land
Goshen
where
the
children
Israel
were
was
there
hail
Exodus
And
Pharaoh
sent
and
called
for
Moses
and
Aaron
and
said
unto
them
have
sinned
this
time
Jehovah
righteous
and
and
people
are
wicked
Exodus
Entreat
Jehovah
for
there
hath
been
enough
these
mighty
thunderings
and
hail
and
will
let
you

shall
stay
longer
Exodus
And
Moses
said
unto
him
soon
gone
out
the
city
will
spread
abroad
hands
unto
Jehovah
the
thunders
shall
cease
neither
shall
there
any
more

Exodus
But
for
thee
and
thy
servants
know
that
will
not
yet
fear
Jehovah
God
Exodus
And
the
flax
and
the
barley
were
smitten
for
the
barley
was
the
ear
and
the
flax
was
bloom
Exodus
But
the
wheat
and
the
spelt
were
not
smitten
for
they
were
not
grown
Exodus
And
Moses
went
out
the
city
from
Pharaoh
and
spread
abroad
his
hands
unto
Jehovah
and
the
thunders
and
hail
ceased
and
the
rain
was
not
poured
upon
the
earth
Exodus
And
when
Pharaoh
saw
that
the
rain
and
the
hail
and
the
thunders
were
ceased
sinned
yet
more
and
hardened
his
heart
and
his
servants
Exodus
And
the
heart
Pharaoh
was
hardened
and
did
not
let
the
children
Israel
Jehovah
had
spoken
Moses
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
unto
Pharaoh
for
have
hardened
his
heart
and
the
heart
his
servants
that

show
these
signs

that
thou
mayest
tell
the

And
Moses

Else

see
the
earth
and
they
shall
eat
the
residue
that
which
escaped
which
remaineth
unto
you
from
the
hail
and
shall
eat
every
tree
which
groweth
for
you
out
the
field
Exodus
and
thy
houses

all
the
Egyptians
neither
thy
fathers
nor
thy

seen
since
the
day
that
they
were
upon
the
earth
unto
this
day
And
turned
and
went
out
from
Pharaoh
Exodus
And
Pharaoh
servants
said
unto
him
How
long
shall
this
man
snare
unto
let
the
men
that
they
may
serve
Jehovah
their
God
knowest
thou
not

that
Egypt
destroyed
Exodus
And
Moses

Aaron
were
brought
again
unto
Pharaoh
and
said
unto
them

Jehovah
your
God
but
who
are
they
that

And
Moses
said
will

with
our
daughters
with
our
flocks
and
with
our

Jehovah
Exodus
And
said
unto
them
Jehovah
with
you
will
let
you
and
your
little
ones
look
for
evil
before
you
Exodus
Not
now
that
are
men
and
serve
Jehovah
for
that
what
desire
And
they
were
driven
out
from
Pharaoh
presence
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Stretch
out
thy
hand
over
the
land
Egypt
for
the
locusts
that
they
may
come
upon
the
land
Egypt
and
eat
every
herb
the
land
even
all
that
the
hail
hath
left
Exodus
And
Moses
stretched
forth
his
rod
over
the
land
Egypt
and
Jehovah
brought
east
wind
upon
the
land
all
that
day
and
all
the
night
and
when
was
morning
the
east
wind
brought
the
locusts
Exodus
And
the
locusts
went
over
all
the
land
Egypt
and
rested
all
the
borders
Egypt
very
grievous
were
they
before
them
there
were
such
locusts
they
neither
after
them
shall
such
Exodus
For
they
covered
the
face
the
whole
earth
that
the
land
was
darkened
and
they
did
eat
every
herb
the
land
and
all
the
fruit
the
trees
which
the
hail
had
left
and
there
remained
not
any
green
thing
either
tree

field
through
all
the

Exodus
Then
Pharaoh
called
for
Moses
and
Aaron
haste
and
said
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
your
God
and
against
you
Exodus
Now
therefore
forgive
pray
thee
sin
only
this
once
and
entreat
Jehovah
your
God
that
may
take
away
from
this
death
only
Exodus
And
went
out
from
Pharaoh
and
entreated
Jehovah
Exodus
And
Jehovah
turned
exceeding
strong
west
wind
which
took
the
locusts
and
drove
them
into
the
Red
Sea
there
remained
not
one
locust
all
the
border
Egypt
Exodus
But
Jehovah
hardened
Pharaoh
heart
and
did
not
let
the
children
Israel
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Stretch
out
thy
hand
toward
heaven
that
there
may
darkness

the
land
Egypt
even
darkness
which
may
felt
Exodus
And
Moses
stretched
forth
his
hand
toward
heaven
and
there
was
thick
darkness
all
the
land
Egypt
three
days
Exodus
they
saw
not
one
another
neither
rose
any
one
from
his
place
for
three
days
but
all
the
children
Israel
had
light
their
dwellings
Exodus
And
Pharaoh
called
unto
Moses
and
said
serve
Jehovah
only
let
your
flocks
and
your
herds
stayed
let
your
little
ones
also

you
Exodus
And
Moses
said
Thou
must
also
give
into
our
hand
sacrifices
and
burnt
offerings
that

sacrifice
unto
Jehovah
our
God
Exodus
Our
cattle

take
serve
Jehovah
our
God
and
know
not
with
what
must
serve
Jehovah
until
come
thither
Exodus
But
Jehovah
hardened
Pharaoh
heart
and
would
not
let
them
Exodus
And
Pharaoh
said
unto
him
Get
thee
from
take
heed
thyself
see
face
more
for
the
day
thou
seest
face
thou
shalt
die
Exodus
And
Moses
said
Thou
hast
spoken
well
will
see
thy
face
again
more
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Yet
one
plague
more
will
bring
upon
Pharaoh
and
upon
Egypt
afterwards
will
let
you
hence
when
shall
let
you
shall
surely
thrust
you
out
hence
altogether
Exodus
Speak
now

the
people
and
let
them
ask
every
man
his
neighbor

every
woman
her

jewels
silver

gold
Exodus
And
Jehovah
gave
the
people
favor
the
sight
the
Egyptians
Moreover
the
man
Moses
was
very
great
the
land

And
Moses
said
Thus

Jehovah
About

Exodus
And
there

But
against

bow
down
themselves
unto
saying
Get

And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Pharaoh

looked
forth
upon

cloud
and
discomfited
the
host
the
Egyptians
Exodus
And
took
off
their
chariot
wheels
and
they
drove

heavily

the
Egyptians
said
Let

from
the
face
Israel
for
Jehovah
fighteth
for
them
against

Egyptians
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Stretch
out

hand
over

sea
that
the
waters
may
come
again
upon

Egyptians
upon
their
chariots
and

And
Moses
stretched
forth
his
hand
over
the
sea

returned
its
strength

morning
appeared

Egyptians
fled
against

Thus
Jehovah
saved
Israel
that
day
out

Israel
saw
the
Egyptians
dead
upon

shore
Exodus
And

Jehovah
did
upon

they
could
not

And
the

murmured
against

saying
What

cried
unto
Jehovah
and
Jehovah
showed

And
the

the

murmured
against

said
unto
them

they
shall
prepare
that

Exodus
And
Moses
and
Aaron
said
unto
all
the
children
Israel
even
then
shall

that
Jehovah
hath
brought
you
out
from
the
land
Egypt
Exodus
and
the

then
shall
see
the
glory
Jehovah
for

And
Moses
said
This

Jehovah
heareth
your

which
murmur
against
him
and
what
are
your
murmurings

not
against

Exodus
And
Moses
said
unto
Aaron
Say
unto
all
the
congregation
the

Israel
Come

your
murmurings

And

unto
the
whole
congregation
the
children
Israel
that
they
looked
toward
the
wilderness
and
behold
the
glory
Jehovah
appeared

Exodus
And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Moses
saying
Exodus

them
saying

And

even
that
the
quails
came
and
covered
the

and
the
morning
the
dew
lay
round
about

camp
Exodus
And
when

that
lay
was
gone
behold
upon

Exodus
And
when
the

said
one
another

said
unto
them

did
and
gathered
some
more

And
when
they
measured

that
gathered
much
had
nothing
over
and
that

lack
they
gathered
every

Exodus
And
Moses
said
unto
them
Let

Exodus
Notwithstanding
they
hearkened
not
unto
Moses
but
some
them
left

Wherefore

And
Moses
said
unto
them
Why

Exodus
And
the
people
thirsted
there
for

murmured
against
Moses
and
said

And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Pass

And
Joshua
discomfited

people
how

And
Moses
went

and
did
obeisance
and
kissed
him
and
they
asked
each
other
their
welfare
and
they
came
into

Exodus
And
Moses
told
his
father
law
all
that
Jehovah
had
done
unto
Pharaoh
and
the
Egyptians
for
Israel
sake
all
the
travail
that
had
come
upon
them
the
way
and
how
Jehovah
delivered
them

And
Jethro
rejoiced
for
all
the
goodness
which
Jehovah
had
done

delivered
them
out

stood
about
Moses
from

And
when
Moses
father

saw
all
that
did
the
people
said
What

thing
that
thou
doest
the
people
why
sittest
thou
thyself
alone
and
all
the
people
stand
about
thee
from

And
Moses
said
unto
his

Because

come
unto
and

said
unto

The

Thou

they
encamped

there
Israel
encamped

And
Moses
came
and
called
for
the
elders
the
people
and
set
before
them
all
these
words
which
Jehovah
commanded
him
Exodus
And
all
the
people
answered
together
and
said
All

Jehovah
hath
spoken

And
Moses
reported
the
words
the
people
unto
Jehovah

And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
come
unto
thee

cloud
that
the
people
may
hear
when
speak
with
thee
and
may
also
believe
thee
for

And
Moses
told
the
words
the
people
unto
Jehovah

And
Jehovah
said
unto

And
thou
shalt
set
bounds
unto
the

sanctified
the

they
washed
their

And
said
unto

they
stood

smoked
because
Jehovah
descended
upon

quaked
greatly
Exodus
And
when
the
voice
the
trumpet
waxed
louder

louder
Moses
spake

God
answered
him

Jehovah
came
down
upon

Sinai
the
top
the

Jehovah
called
Moses

And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
down

the

lest
they
break

gaze
and
many
them
perish
Exodus
And
let
the
priests
also
that
come
near
Jehovah
sanctify
themselves
lest
Jehovah
break
forth
upon
them
Exodus
And
Moses
said
unto
Jehovah
The
people
cannot
come

Sinai
for
thou
didst
charge
saying
Set
bounds
about
the
mount

And
Jehovah
said
unto
him

And
when
the

saw
that
Moses
delayed
come
down
from

the
people
gathered
themselves
together
unto
Aaron
and
said
unto
him
make
gods
which
shall
before
for
for
this
Moses
the
man
that
brought
out
the
land
Egypt
know
not
what
become
him
Exodus
And
Aaron
said
unto
them
Break
off
the
golden
rings
which
are
the
ears
your
wives
your
sons
and
your
daughters
and
bring
them
unto
Exodus
And
all
the
people
brake
off
the
golden
rings
which
were
their
ears
and
brought
them
unto
Aaron
Exodus
And
received
their
hand
and
fashioned
with
graving
tool
and
made
molten
calf
and
they
said
These
are
thy
gods
Israel
which
brought
thee
out
the
land
Egypt
Exodus
And
when
Aaron
saw
this
built
altar
before
and
Aaron
made
proclamation
and
said
morrow
shall
feast
Jehovah
Exodus
And
they
rose
early
the
morrow
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
brought

offerings
and
the
people
sat
down
eat
and
drink
and
rose
play

And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Moses
get
thee
down
for
thy
people
that
thou
broughtest
out
the
land
Egypt
have
corrupted
themselves
Exodus
they
have
turned
aside
quickly
out
the
way
which
commanded
them
they
have
made
them
molten
calf
and
have
worshipped
and
have
sacrificed
unto
and
said
These
are
thy
gods
Israel
which
brought
thee
out

Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
have
seen
this
people
and
behold
stiffnecked
people
Exodus
now
therefore
let
alone
that
wrath
may
wax
hot
against
them
and
that
may
consume
them
and
will
make
thee
great
nation
Exodus
And
Moses
besought
Jehovah
his
God
and
said
Jehovah
why
doth
thy
wrath
wax
hot
against
thy
people
that
thou
hast
brought
forth
out
the
land
Egypt
with
great
power
and
with
mighty
hand
Exodus
Wherefore
should
the
Egyptians
speak
saying
For
evil
did
bring
them
forth
slay
them
the
mountains
and
consume
them
from
the
face
the
earth
Turn
from
thy
fierce
wrath
and
repent
this
evil
against
thy
people
Exodus
Remember
Abraham
Isaac
and
Israel
thy
servants
whom
thou
swarest
thine
own
self
and
saidst
unto
them
will
multiply
your
seed
the
stars
heaven
and
all
this
land
that
have
spoken
will
give
unto
your
seed
and
they
shall
inherit
for
ever
Exodus
And
Jehovah
repented
the
evil
which
said
would
unto
his
people
Exodus
And
Moses
turned
and
went
down
from
the
mount
with
the
two
tables
the
testimony
his
hand
tables
that
were
written
both
their
sides
the
one
side
and
the
other
were
they
written
Exodus
And
the
tables
were
the
work
God
and
the
writing
was
the
writing
God
graven
upon
the
tables
Exodus
And
when
Joshua
heard
the
noise
the
people
they
shouted
said
unto
Moses
There
noise
war
the
camp
Exodus
And
said
not
the
voice
them
that
shout
for
mastery
neither
the
voice
them
that
cry
for
being
overcome
but
the
noise
them
that
sing
hear
Exodus
And
came
pass
soon
came
nigh
unto
the
camp
that
saw
the
calf
and
the
dancing
and
Moses
anger
waxed
hot
and
cast
the
tables
out
his
hands
and
brake
them
beneath
the
mount
Exodus
And
took
the
calf
which
they
had
made
and
burnt
with
fire
and
ground
powder
and
strewed
upon
the
water
and
made
the
children
Israel
drink
Exodus
And
Moses
said
unto
Aaron
What
did
this
people
unto
thee
that
thou
hast
brought
great
sin
upon
them
Exodus
And
Aaron
said
Let
not
the
anger
lord
wax
hot
thou
knowest
the
people
that
they
are
set
evil
Exodus
For
they
said
unto
Make
gods
which
shall
before
for
for
this
Moses
the
man
that
brought
out
the
land
Egypt
know
not
what
become
him
Exodus
And
said
unto
them
Whosoever
hath
any
gold
let
them
break
off
they
gave
and
cast
into
the
fire
and
there
came
out
this
calf
Exodus
And
when
Moses
saw
that
the
people
were
broken
loose
for
Aaron
had
let
them
loose
for
derision
among
their
enemies
Exodus
then
Moses
stood
the
gate
the
camp
and
said
Whoso
Jehovah
side
let
him
come
unto
And
all
the
sons
Levi
gathered
themselves
together
unto
him
Exodus
And
said
unto
them
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Put
every
man
his
sword
upon
his
thigh
and
and
fro
from
gate
gate
throughout
the
camp
and
slay
every
man
his
brother
and
every
man
his
companion
and
every
man
his
neighbor
Exodus
And
the
sons
Levi
did
according
the
word
Moses
and
there
fell
the
people
that
day
about
three
thousand
men
Exodus
And
Moses
said
Consecrate
yourselves
day
Jehovah
yea
every
man
against
his
son
and
against
his
brother
that
may
bestow
upon
you
blessing
this
day
Exodus
And
came
pass
the
morrow
that
Moses
said
unto
the
people
have
sinned
great
sin
and
now
will
unto
Jehovah
peradventure
shall
make
atonement
for
your
sin
Exodus
And
Moses
returned
unto
Jehovah
and
said
this
people
have
sinned
great
sin
and
have
made
them
gods
gold
Exodus
Yet
now
thou
wilt
forgive
their
sin
and
not
blot
pray
thee
out
thy
book
which
thou
hast
written
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Whosoever
hath
sinned
against
him
will
blot
out
book
Exodus
And
now
lead
the
people
unto
the
place
which
have
spoken
unto
thee
behold
mine
angel
shall
before
thee
nevertheless
the
day
when
visit
will
visit
their
sin
upon
them
Exodus
And
Jehovah
smote
the
people
because
they
made
the
calf
which
Aaron
made
Exodus
And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Moses
Depart
hence
thou
and
the
people
that
thou
hast
brought
out
the
land
Egypt
unto
the
land
which
sware
unto
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
saying
Unto
thy
seed
will
give
Exodus
and
will
send
angel
before
thee
and
will
drive
out
the
Canaanite
the
Amorite
and
the
Hittite
and
the
Perizzite
the
Hivite
and
the
Jebusite
Exodus
unto
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
for
will
not
the
midst
thee
for
thou
art
stiffnecked
people
lest
consume
thee
the
way
Exodus
And
when
the
people
heard
these
evil
tidings
they
mourned
and
man
did
put
him
his
ornaments
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Say
unto
the
children
Israel
are
stiffnecked
people
into
the
midst
thee
for
one
moment
shall
consume
thee
therefore
now
put
off
thy
ornaments
from
thee
that
may
know
what
unto
thee
Exodus
And
the
children
Israel
stripped
themselves
their
ornaments
from
mount
Horeb
onward
Exodus
Now
Moses
used
take
the
tent
and
pitch
without
the
camp
afar
off
from
the
camp
and
called
The
tent
meeting
And
came
pass
that
every
one
that
sought
Jehovah
went
out
unto
the
tent
meeting
which
was
without
the
camp
Exodus
And
came
pass
when
Moses
went
out
unto
the
Tent
that
all
the
people
rose
and
stood
every
man
his
tent
door
and
looked
after
Moses
until
was
gone
into
the
Tent
Exodus
And
came
pass
when
Moses
entered
into
the
Tent
the
pillar
cloud
descended
and
stood
the
door
the
Tent
and
Jehovah
spake
with
Moses
Exodus
And
all
the
people
saw
the
pillar
cloud
stand
the
door
the
Tent
and
all
the
people
rose
and
worshipped
every
man
his
tent
door
Exodus
And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Moses
face
face
man
speaketh
unto
his
friend
And
turned
again
into
the
camp
but
his
minister
Joshua
the
son
Nun
young
man
departed
not
out
the
Tent
Exodus
And
Moses
said
unto
Jehovah
See
thou
sayest
unto
Bring
this
people
and
thou
hast
not
let
know
whom
thou
wilt
send
with
Yet
thou
hast
said

Now
therefore
pray

and
consider
that
this
nation

people
Exodus
And
said
presence
shall

thee
and

give
thee

Exodus
And
said
unto
him

not
hence
Exodus
For
wherein
now

not
that
thou
goest
with
that
are
separated
and
thy
people
from
all
the
people
that
are
upon
the
face
the
earth
Exodus
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
will
this
thing
also

thou
hast
spoken
for
thou
hast
found
favor
sight
and
know
thee

And
said
Show

And
said

proclaim
the
name

Exodus
And
said
Thou
canst
not
see
face
for
man

not
see

live
Exodus
and
Jehovah
said
Behold
there
place
and
thou
shalt
stand
upon
the
rock
Exodus
and
shall
come
pass
while
glory
passeth
that
will
put
thee

cover
thee
with
hand
until

passed
Exodus
and
will
take
away
hand
and
thou
shalt
see
back
but

And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Hew
thee
two
tables
stone
like
unto
the
first
and
will
write
upon
the
tables
the
words
that

And

And
hewed
two
tables

like
unto

Moses
rose
early
the
morning
and
went
unto
mount
Sinai
Jehovah
had
commanded
him
and
took
his
hand
two

And
Jehovah
descended

cloud
and
stood
with
him
there
and
proclaimed

wherefore

sight
that
thou
layest
the
burden
all
this
people
upon
Numbers
Have

them
forth
that
thou
shouldest
say
unto

bosom
nursing
father
carrieth
the
sucking
child
unto
the
land
which
thou
swarest
unto
their
fathers
Numbers
Whence
should
have
flesh
give
unto
all
this
people
for
they
weep
unto
saying
Give
flesh
that

eat
Numbers
not
able
bear
all
this
people
alone
because
too
heavy
for
Numbers
And
thou
deal
thus
with
kill
pray
thee
out
hand
have
found
favor
thy
sight
and
let

see
wretchedness
Numbers
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Gather
unto
seventy
men
the
elders
Israel
whom
thou
knowest
the
elders
the
people
and
officers
over
them
and
bring
them
unto
the
tent
meeting
that
they
may
stand
there
with
thee
Numbers
And
will
come
down
and
talk
with
thee
there
and
will
take
the
Spirit
which
upon
thee
and
will
put
upon
them
and
they
shall
bear
the
burden
the
people
with
thee
that
thou
bear
not
thyself
alone
Numbers
And
say
thou
unto
the
people
Sanctify
yourselves
against
morrow
and
shall
eat
flesh
for
have
wept
the
ears
Jehovah
saying
Who
shall
give
flesh
eat
for

well
with
Egypt
therefore
Jehovah
will
give
you
flesh
and
shall
eat
Numbers

one
day
nor
two
days
nor
five
days
neither
ten
days
nor
twenty
days
Numbers
but
whole
month
until
come
out
your
nostrils
and
loathsome
unto
you
because
that
have
rejected
Jehovah
who
among
you
and
have
wept
before
him
saying
Why
came
forth
out
Egypt
Numbers
And
Moses
said
The
people
among
whom
are
six
hundred
thousand
footmen
and
thou
hast
said
will
give
them
flesh
that
they
may
eat
whole
month
Numbers
Shall
flocks
and
herds
slain
for
them
suffice
them
shall
all
the
fish
the
sea
gathered
together
for
them
suffice
them
Numbers
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Jehovah
hand
waxed
short
now
shalt
thou
see
whether
word
shall
come
pass
unto
thee
not
Numbers
And
Moses
went
out
and
told
the
people
the
words
Jehovah
and
gathered
seventy
men
the
elders
the
people
and
set
them
round
about
the
Tent
Numbers
And
Jehovah
came
down
the
cloud
and
spake
unto
him
and
took
the
Spirit
that
was
upon
him
and
put
upon
the
seventy
elders
and
came
pass
that
when
the
Spirit
rested
upon
them
they
prophesied
but
they
did
more
Numbers
But
there
remained
two
men
the
camp
the
name
the
one
was
Eldad
and
the
name
the
other
Medad
and
the
Spirit
rested
upon
them
and
they
were
them
that
were
written
but
had
not
gone
out
unto
the
Tent
and
they
prophesied
the
camp
Numbers
And
there
ran
young
man
and
told
Moses
and
said
Eldad
and
Medad
prophesy
the
camp
Numbers
And
Joshua
the
son
Nun
the
minister
Moses
one
his
chosen
men
answered
and
said
lord
Moses
forbid
them
Numbers
And
Moses
said
unto
him
Art
thou
jealous
for
sake
would
that
all
Jehovah
people
were
prophets
that
Jehovah
would
put
his
Spirit
upon
them
Numbers
And
Moses
gat
him
into
the
camp
and
the
elders
Israel
Numbers
And
there
went
forth
wind
from
Jehovah
and
brought
quails
from
the
sea
and
let
them
fall
the
camp
about
day
journey
this
side
and
day
journey
the
other
side
round
about
the
camp
and
about
two
cubits
above
the
face
the
earth
Numbers
And
the
people
rose
all
that
day
and
all
the
night
and
all
the
next
day
and
gathered
the
quails
that
gathered
least
gathered
ten
homers
and
they
spread
them
all
abroad
for
themselves
round
about
the
camp
Numbers
While
the
flesh
was
yet
between
their
teeth
ere
was
chewed
the
anger
Jehovah
was
kindled
against
the
people
and
Jehovah
smote
the
people
with
very
great
plague
Numbers
And
the
name
that
place
was
called
Kibrothhattaavah
because
there
they
buried
the
people
that
lusted
Numbers
From
Kibrothhattaavah
the
people
journeyed
unto
Hazeroth
and
they
abode
Hazeroth
Numbers
And
Miriam
and
Aaron
spake
against
Moses
because
the
Cushite
woman
whom
had
married
for
had
married
Cushite
woman
Numbers
And
they
said
Hath
Jehovah
indeed
spoken
only
with
Moses
hath
not
spoken
also
with
And
Jehovah
heard
Numbers
Now
the
man
Moses
was
very
meek
above
all
the
men
that
were
upon
the
face
the
earth
Numbers
And
Jehovah
spake
suddenly
unto
Moses
and
unto
Aaron
and
unto
Miriam
Come
out
three
unto
the
tent
meeting
And
they
three
came
out
Numbers
And
Jehovah
came
down
pillar
cloud
and
stood
the
door
the
Tent
and
called
Aaron
and
Miriam
and
they
both
came
forth
Numbers
And
said
Hear
now
words
there

among
you
Jehovah
will
make
myself
known
unto
him

Moses
not
faithful
all
house
Numbers
with
him
will
speak
mouth
mouth
even
manifestly
and
not
dark
speeches
and
the
form
Jehovah
shall
behold
wherefore
then
were
not
afraid
speak
against
servant
against
Moses
Numbers
And
the
anger
Jehovah
was
kindled
against
them
and
departed
Numbers
And
the
cloud
removed
from
over
the
Tent
and
behold
Miriam
was
leprous
white
snow
and
Aaron
looked
upon
Miriam
and
behold
she
was
leprous
Numbers
And
Aaron
said
unto
Moses
lord
lay
not
pray
thee
sin
upon
for
that
have
done
foolishly
and
for
that
have
sinned
Numbers
Let
her
not
pray
one
dead
whom
the
flesh
half
consumed
when
cometh
out
his
mother
womb
Numbers
And
Moses
cried
unto
Jehovah
saying
Heal
her
God
beseech
thee
Numbers
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
her
father
had
but
spit

And

And
afterward
the

And

Moses
sent

And
Moses
called
Hoshea
the
son
Nun
Joshua
Numbers
And
Moses
sent
them
spy
out
the
land
Canaan
and
said
unto
them
Get
you
this
way
the
South
and
into
the
hill
country
Numbers
and
see
the
land
what
and
the
people
that

therein
whether
they
are
strong

whether
they
are
few
many
Numbers
and
what
the

that
they
dwell
whether
good

and
what
cities
they
are
that
they
dwell
whether

and
what

whether

not
And
good
courage
and
bring

fruit

Now
the
time
was
the
time
the
first
ripe
grapes
Numbers
they
went
and
spied
out
the
land
from
the
wilderness
Zin
unto
Rehob
the
entrance
Hamath
Numbers
And
they
went
the
South
and
came
unto
Hebron
and
Ahaiman
Sheshai
and
Talmai
the
children
Anak
were
there
Now
Hebron
was
built
seven
years
before
Zoan
Egypt
Numbers
And
they
came
unto
the
valley
Eshcol
and
cut
down
from
thence
branch
with
one
cluster
grapes
and
they
bare
upon
staff
between
two
they
brought
also
the
pomegranates
and
the
figs
Numbers
That
place
was
called
the
valley
Eshcol
because
the
cluster
which
the
children
Israel
cut
down
from
thence
Numbers
And
they
returned
from
spying
out
the
land
the
end
forty
days
Numbers
And
they
went
and
came
Moses
and
Aaron
and
all
the
congregation
the
children
Israel
unto
the
wilderness
Paran
Kadesh
and
brought
back
word
unto
them
and
unto
all
the
congregation
and
showed
them
the
fruit
the
land
Numbers
And
they
told
him
and
said
came
unto
the
land
whither
thou
sentest
and
surely
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
and
this
the
fruit
Numbers
Howbeit
the
people
that
dwell
the
land
are
strong
and
the
cities
are
fortified
and
very
great
and
moreover
saw
the
children
Anak
there
Numbers
Amalek
dwelleth
the
land
the
South
and
the
Hittite
and
the
Jebusite
and
the
Amorite
dwell
the
hill
country
and
the
Canaanite
dwelleth
the
sea
and
along
the
side
the
Jordan
Numbers
And
Caleb
stilled
the
people
before
Moses
and
said
Let
once
and
possess
for
are
well
able
overcome
Numbers
But
the
men
that
went
with
him
said
are
not
able
against
the
people
for
they
are
stronger
than
Numbers
And
they
brought
evil
report
the
land
which
they
had
spied
out
unto
the
children
Israel
saying
The
land
through
which
have
gone
spy
out
land
that
eateth
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
all
the
people
that
saw
are
men
great
stature
Numbers
And
there
saw
the
Nephilim
the
sons
Anak
who
come
the
Nephilim
and
were
our
own
sight
grasshoppers
and
were
their
sight
Numbers
And
all
the
congregation
lifted
their
voice
and
cried
and
the
people
wept
that
night
Numbers
And
all
the
children
Israel
murmured
against
Moses
and
against
Aaron
and
the
whole
congregation
said
unto
them
Would
that
had
died
the
land
Egypt
would
that
had
died
this
wilderness
Numbers
And
wherefore
doth
Jehovah
bring
unto
this
land
fall
the
sword
Our
wives
and
our
little
ones
will
prey
were
not
better
for
return
into
Egypt
Numbers
And
they
said
one
another
Let
make
captain
and
let
return
into
Egypt
Numbers
Then
Moses
and
Aaron
fell
their
faces
before
all
the
assembly
the
congregation
the
children
Israel
Numbers
And
Joshua
the
son
Nun
and
Caleb
the
son
Jephunneh
who
were
them
that
spied
out
the
land
rent
their
clothes
Numbers
and
they
spake
unto
all
the
congregation
the
children
Israel
saying
The
land
which
passed
through
spy
out
exceeding
good
land
Numbers
Jehovah
delight
then
will
bring
into
this
land
and
give
unto
land
which
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
Numbers
Only
rebel
not
against
Jehovah
neither
fear
the
people
the
land
for
they
are
bread
for
their
defence
removed
from
over
them
and
Jehovah
with
fear
them
not
Numbers
But
all
the
congregation
bade
stone
them
with
stones
And
the
glory
Jehovah
appeared
the
tent
meeting
unto
all
the
children
Israel
Numbers
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
How
long
will
this
people
despise
and
how
long
will
they
not
believe
for
all
the
signs
which
have
wrought
among
them
Numbers
will
smite
them
with
the
pestilence
and
disinherit
them
and
will
make
thee
nation
greater
and
mightier
than
they
Numbers
And
Moses
said
unto
Jehovah
Then
the
Egyptians
will
hear
for
thou
broughtest
this
people
thy
might
from
among
them
Numbers
and
they
will
tell
the
inhabitants
this
land
They
have
heard
that
thou
Jehovah
art
the
midst
this
people
for
thou
Jehovah
art
seen
face
face
and
thy
cloud
standeth
over
them
and
thou
goest
before
them
pillar
cloud
day
and
pillar
fire
night
Numbers
Now
thou
shalt
kill
this
people
one
man
then
the
nations
which
have
heard
the
fame
thee
will
speak
saying
Numbers
Because
Jehovah
was
not
able
bring
this
people
into
the
land
which
sware
unto
them
therefore
hath
slain
them
the
wilderness
Numbers
And
now
pray
thee
let
the
power
the
Lord
great
according
thou
hast
spoken
saying
Numbers
Jehovah
slow
anger
and
abundant
lovingkindness
forgiving
iniquity
and
transgression
and
that
will
means
clear
the
guilty
visiting
the
iniquity
the
fathers
upon
the
children
upon
the
third
and
upon
the
fourth
generation
Numbers
Pardon
pray
thee
the
iniquity
this
people
according
unto
the
greatness
thy
lovingkindness
and
according
thou
hast
forgiven
this
people
from
Egypt
even
until
now
Numbers
And
Jehovah
said
have
pardoned
according
thy
word
Numbers
but
very
deed
live
and
all
the
earth
shall
filled
with
the
glory
Jehovah
Numbers
because
all
those
men
that
have
seen
glory
and
signs
which
wrought
Egypt
and
the
wilderness
yet
have
tempted
these
ten
times
and
have
not
hearkened
voice
Numbers
surely
they
shall
not
see
the
land
which
sware
unto
their
fathers
neither
shall
any
them
that
despised
see
Numbers
but
servant
Caleb
because
had
another
spirit
with
him
and
hath
followed
fully
him
will
bring
into
the
land
whereinto
went
and
his
seed
shall
possess
Numbers
Now
the
Amalekite
and
the
Canaanite
dwell
the
valley
morrow
turn
and
get
you
into
the
wilderness
the
way
the
Red
Sea
Numbers
And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Moses
and
unto
Aaron
saying
Numbers
How
long
shall
bear
with
this
evil
congregation
that
murmur
against
have
heard
the
murmurings
the
children
Israel
which
they
murmur
against
Numbers
Say
unto
them
live
saith
Jehovah
surely
have
spoken
mine
ears
will
you
Numbers
your
dead
bodies
shall
fall
this
wilderness
and
all
that
were
numbered
you
according
your
whole
number
from
twenty
years
old
and
upward
that
have
murmured
against
Numbers
surely
shall
not
come
into
the
land
concerning
which
sware
that
would
make
you
dwell
therein
save
Caleb
the
son
Jephunneh
and
Joshua
the
son
Nun
Numbers
But
your
little
ones
that
said
should
prey
them
will
bring
and
they
shall
know
the
land
which
have
rejected
Numbers
But
for
you
your
dead
bodies
shall
fall
this
wilderness
Numbers
And
your
children
shall
wanderers
the
wilderness
forty
years
and
shall
bear
your
whoredoms
until
your
dead
bodies
consumed
the
wilderness
Numbers
After
the
number
the
days
which
spied
out
the
land
even
forty
days
for
every
day
year
shall
bear
your
iniquities
even
forty
years
and
shall
know
alienation
Numbers
Jehovah
have
spoken
surely
this
will
unto
all
this
evil
congregation
that
are
gathered
together
against
this
wilderness
they
shall
consumed
and
there
they
shall
die
Numbers
And
the
men
whom
Moses
sent
spy
out
the
land
who
returned
and
made
all
the
congregation
murmur
against
him
bringing
evil
report
against
the
land
Numbers
even
those
men
that
did
bring
evil
report
the
land
died
the
plague
before
Jehovah
Numbers
But
Joshua
the
son
Nun
and
Caleb
the
son
Jephunneh
remained
alive
those
men
that
went
spy
out
the
land
Numbers
And
Moses
told
these
words
unto
all
the
children
Israel
and
the
people
mourned
greatly
Numbers
And
they
rose
early
the
morning
and
gat
them
the
top
the
mountain
saying
are
here
and
will
unto
the
place
which
Jehovah
hath
promised
for
have
sinned
Numbers
And
Moses
said
Wherefore
now
transgress
the
commandment
Jehovah
seeing
shall
not
prosper
Numbers
not
for
Jehovah
not
among
you
that
not
smitten
down
before
your
enemies
Numbers
For
there
the
Amalekite
and
the
Canaanite
are
before
you
and
shall
fall
the
sword
because
are
turned
back
from
following
Jehovah
therefore
Jehovah
will
not
with
you
Numbers
But
they
presumed
the
top
the
mountain
nevertheless
the
ark
the
covenant
Jehovah
and
Moses
departed
not
out
the
camp
Numbers
Then
the
Amalekite
came
down
and
the
Canaanite
who
dwelt
that
mountain
and
smote
them
and
beat
them
down
even
unto
Hormah
Numbers
And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Moses
saying
Numbers
Speak
unto
the
children
Israel
and
say
unto
them

Numbers
and
they
assembled
themselves
together
against

said
unto

And

Numbers
This
take
you
censers
Korah
and
all
his
company
Numbers
and
put
fire

and
put

upon
them
before
Jehovah
morrow
and
shall
that
the
man
whom
Jehovah
doth
choose
shall
holy
take
too
much
upon
you
sons
Levi
Numbers
And
Moses
said
unto
Korah
Hear
now
sons
Levi
Numbers
seemeth
but
small
thing
unto
you
that
the
God
Israel
hath
separated
you
from
the
congregation
Israel
bring
you
near
himself
the
service
the
tabernacle
Jehovah
and
stand
before
the
congregation
minister
unto

Numbers
and
that
hath
brought
thee
near
and
all
thy
brethren
the
sons
Levi
with
thee
and
seek
the
priesthood
also
Numbers
Therefore
thou
and
all
thy
company
are
gathered
together
against
Jehovah
and
Aaron
what
that
murmur
against
him
Numbers
And
Moses
sent
call
Dathan
and
Abiram
the
sons
Eliab
and
they
said
will
not
come
Numbers
small
thing
that
thou
hast
brought
out
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
kill
the
wilderness
but
thou
must
needs
make
thyself
also
prince
over
Numbers
Moreover
thou
hast
not
brought
into
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
nor
given
inheritance
fields
and
vineyards
wilt
thou
put
out
the
eyes
these
men
will
not
come
Numbers
And
Moses
was
very
wroth
and
said
unto
Jehovah
Respect
not
thou
their
offering
have
not
taken
one
ass
from
them
neither
have
hurt
one
them
Numbers
And
Moses
said
unto
Korah
thou
and
all
thy
company
before
Jehovah
thou
and
they
and
Aaron
morrow
Numbers
and
take
every
man
his
censer
and
put

and
bring
before
Jehovah
every
man
his
censer
two
hundred
and
fifty
censers
thou
also
and
Aaron
each
his
censer
Numbers
And
they
took
every
man
his
censer
and
put
fire
them
and
laid
incense
thereon
and
stood
the
door
the
tent
meeting
with
Moses
and
Aaron
Numbers
And
Korah
assembled
all
the
congregation
against
them
unto
the
door
the
tent
meeting
and
the
glory
Jehovah
appeared
unto
all
the
congregation
Numbers
And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Moses
and
unto
Aaron
saying
Numbers
Separate
yourselves
from
among
this
congregation
that
may
consume
them
moment
Numbers
And
they
fell
upon
their
faces
and
said
God
the
God
the
spirits
all
flesh
shall
one
man
sin
and
wilt
thou
wroth
with
all
the
congregation
Numbers
And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Moses
saying
Numbers
Speak
unto
the
congregation
saying
Get
you
from
about
the
tabernacle
Korah
Dathan
and
Abiram
Numbers
And
Moses
rose
and
went
unto
Dathan
and
Abiram
and
the
elders
Israel
followed
him
Numbers
And
spake
unto
the
congregation
saying
Depart
pray
you
from
the
tents
these
wicked
men
and
touch
nothing
theirs
lest
consumed
all
their
sins
Numbers
they
gat
them
from
the
tabernacle
Korah
Dathan
and
Abiram
every
side
and
Dathan
and
Abiram
came
out
and
stood
the
door
their
tents
and
their
wives
and
their
sons
and
their
little
ones
Numbers
And
Moses
said
Hereby
shall
know
that
Jehovah
hath
sent
all
these
works
for
have
not
done
them
mine
own
mind
Numbers
these
men
die
the
common
death
all
men
they
visited
after
the
visitation
all
men
then
Jehovah
hath
not
sent
Numbers
But
Jehovah
make
new
thing
and
the
ground
open
its
mouth
and
swallow
them
with
all
that
appertain
unto
them
and
they
down
alive
into
Sheol
then
shall
understand
that
these
men
have
despised
Jehovah
Numbers
And
came
pass
made
end
speaking
all
these
words
that
the
ground
clave
asunder
that
was
under
them
Numbers
and
the
earth
opened
its
mouth
and
swallowed
them
and
their
households
and
all
the
men
that
appertained
unto
Korah
and
all
their
goods
Numbers
they
and
all
that
appertained
them
went
down
alive
into
Sheol
and
the
earth
closed
upon
them
and
they
perished
from
among
the
assembly
Numbers
And
all
Israel
that
were
round
about
them
fled
the
cry
them
for
they
said
Lest
the
earth
swallow
Numbers
And
fire
came
forth
from
Jehovah
and
devoured
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
that
offered
the
incense
Numbers
And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Moses
saying
Numbers
Speak
unto
Eleazar
the
son
Aaron
the
priest
that
take
the
censers
out
the
burning
and
scatter

Numbers
even

and
let

Jehovah
therefore
they
are
holy
and
they
shall
sign

the
children
Israel
Numbers
And
Eleazar
the
priest
took

But
the
morrow
all
the
congregation
the
children
Israel
murmured
against
Moses
and
against
Aaron
saying

Jehovah
Numbers
And
came

when
the

was
assembled
against

and
against

that
they
looked
toward

meeting
and
behold
the
cloud

Jehovah

Numbers
And
Moses
and
Aaron
came

tent
meeting
Numbers
And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Moses
saying
Numbers
Get
you
from
among
this
congregation
that

consume
them
moment
And
they
fell
upon
their
faces
Numbers
And
Moses
said
unto
Aaron
Take
thy
censer
and
put
fire
therein
from

and
lay

thereon
and
carry
quickly

Numbers
And

Now
they
that
died

Numbers
And
Aaron
returned
unto
Moses
unto
the
door

meeting
and
the

And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Moses
saying
Numbers

And

And

And

day
shall
purify
him
and
shall
wash
his
clothes
and
bathe
himself
water
and
shall
clean
even
Numbers
But
the
man
that
shall
unclean
and
shall
not
purify
himself
that
soul
shall
cut
off
from
the
midst
the
assembly
because
hath
defiled
the
sanctuary
Jehovah
the
water
for
impurity
hath
not
been
sprinkled
upon
him
unclean
Numbers
And
shall
perpetual
statute

them
and
that
sprinkleth
the

and
that

even
Numbers
And
whatsoever
the
unclean
person
toucheth
shall
unclean
and
the
soul
that
toucheth
shall
unclean
until
even
Numbers
And
the
children
Israel
even
the
whole
congregation
came
into
the
wilderness
Zin
the
first
month
and
the
people
abode
Kadesh
and
Miriam
died
there
and
was
buried
there
Numbers
And
there
was
water
for
the
congregation
and
they
assembled
themselves
together
against
Moses
and
against
Aaron
Numbers
And
the
people
strove
with
Moses
and
spake
saying
Would
that
had
died
when
our
brethren
died
before
Jehovah
Numbers
And
why
have
brought
the
assembly
Jehovah
into
this
wilderness
that
should
die
there
and
our
beasts
Numbers
And
wherefore
have
made
come
out
Egypt
bring
unto
this
evil
place
place
seed
figs
vines
pomegranates
neither
there
any
water
drink
Numbers
And
Moses
and
Aaron
went
from
the
presence
the
assembly
unto
the
door
the
tent
meeting
and
fell
upon
their
faces
and
the
glory
Jehovah
appeared
unto
them
Numbers
And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Moses
saying
Numbers
Take
the
rod
and
assemble
the
congregation
thou
and
Aaron
thy
brother
and
speak
unto
the
rock
before
their
eyes
that
give
forth
its
water
and
thou
shalt
bring
forth
them
water
out
the
rock
thou
shalt
give
the
congregation
and
their
cattle
drink
Numbers
And
Moses
took
the
rod
from
before
Jehovah
commanded
him
Numbers
And
Moses
and
Aaron
gathered
the
assembly
together
before
the
rock
and
said
unto
them
Hear
now
rebels
shall
bring
you
forth
water
out
this
rock
Numbers
And
Moses
lifted
his
hand
and
smote
the
rock
with
his
rod
twice
and
water
came
forth
abundantly
and
the
congregation
drank
and
their
cattle
Numbers
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
and
Aaron
Because
believed
not
sanctify
the
eyes
the
children
Israel
therefore
shall
not
bring
this
assembly
into
the
land
which
have
given
them
Numbers
These
are
the
waters
Meribah
because
the
children
Israel
strove
with
Jehovah
and
was
sanctified
them
Numbers
And
Moses
sent
messengers
from
Kadesh
unto
the
king
Edom
Thus
saith
thy
brother
Israel
Thou
knowest
all
the
travail
that
hath
befallen
Numbers
how
our
fathers
went
down
into
Egypt
and
dwelt
Egypt
long
time
and
the
Egyptians
dealt
ill
with
and
our
fathers
Numbers
and
when
cried
unto
Jehovah
heard
our
voice
and
sent
angel
and
brought
forth
out
Egypt
and
behold
are
Kadesh
city
the
uttermost
thy
border
Numbers
Let
pass
pray
thee
through
thy
land
will
not
pass
through
field
through
vineyard
neither
will
drink
the
water
the
wells
will
along
the
king
highway
will
not
turn
aside
the
right
hand
nor
the
left
until
have
passed
thy
border
Numbers
And
Edom
said
unto
him
Thou
shalt
not
pass
through
lest
come
out
with
the
sword
against
thee
Numbers
And
the
children
Israel
said
unto
him
will
the
highway
and
drink
thy
water
and
cattle
then
will
give
the
price
thereof
let
only
without
doing
anything
else
pass
through
feet
Numbers
And
said
Thou
shalt
not
pass
through
And
Edom
came
out
against
him
with
much
people
and
with
strong
hand
Numbers
Thus
Edom
refused
give
Israel
passage
through
his
border
wherefore
Israel
turned
away
from
him
Numbers
And
they
journeyed
from
Kadesh
and
the
children
Israel
even
the
whole
congregation
came
unto
mount
Hor
Numbers
And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Moses
and
Aaron
mount
Hor
the
border
the
land
Edom
saying
Numbers
Aaron
shall
gathered
unto
his
people
for
shall
not
enter
into
the
land
which
have
given
unto
the
children
Israel
because
rebelled
against
word
the
waters
Meribah
Numbers
Take
Aaron
and
Eleazar
his
son
and
bring
them
unto
mount
Hor
Numbers
and
strip
Aaron
his
garments
and
put
them
upon
Eleazar
his
son
and
Aaron
shall
gathered
unto
his
people
and
shall
die
there
Numbers
And
Moses
did
Jehovah
commanded
and
they
went
into
mount
Hor
the
sight
all
the
congregation
Numbers
And
Moses
stripped
Aaron
his
garments
and
put
them
upon
Eleazar
his
son
and
Aaron
died
there
the
top
the
mount
and
Moses
and
Eleazar
came
down
from
the
mount
Numbers
And
when
all
the
congregation
saw
that
Aaron
was
dead
they
wept
for
Aaron
thirty
days
even
all
the
house
Israel
Numbers
And
the
Canaanite
the
king
Arad
who
dwelt
the
South
heard
tell
that
Israel
came
the
way
Atharim
and
fought
against
Israel
and
took
some
them
captive
Numbers
And
Israel
vowed
vow
unto
Jehovah
and
said
thou
wilt
indeed
deliver
this
people
into
hand
then
will
utterly
destroy
their
cities
Numbers
And
Jehovah
hearkened
the
voice
Israel
and
delivered
the
Canaanites
and
they
utterly
destroyed
them
and
their
cities
and
the
name
the
place
was
called
Hormah
Numbers
And
they
journeyed
from
mount
Hor
the
way
the
Red
Sea
compass
the
land
Edom
and
the
soul
the
people
was
much
discouraged
because
the
way
Numbers
And
the
people
spake
against
God
and
against
Moses
Wherefore
have
brought
out
Egypt
die
the
wilderness
for
there
bread
and
there
water
and
our
soul
loatheth
this
light
bread
Numbers
And
Jehovah
sent
fiery
serpents
among
the
people
and
they
bit
the
people
and
much
people
Israel
died
Numbers
And
the
people
came
Moses
and
said
have
sinned
because
have
spoken
against
Jehovah
and
against
thee
pray
unto
Jehovah
that
take
away
the
serpents
from
And
Moses
prayed
for
the
people
Numbers
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Make
thee
fiery
serpent
and
set
upon
standard
and
shall
come
pass
that
every
one
that
bitten
when
seeth
shall
live
Numbers
And
Moses
made
serpent
brass
and
set
upon
the
standard
and
came
pass
that
serpent
had
bitten
any
man
when
looked
unto
the
serpent
brass
lived
Numbers
And
the
children
Israel
journeyed
and
encamped
Oboth
Numbers
And
they
journeyed
from
Oboth
and
encamped
Iyeabarim
the
wilderness
which
before
Moab
toward
the

Numbers
From
thence
they
journeyed
and
encamped

Zered
Numbers
From
thence
they
journeyed
and
encamped
the
other
side
the

which
the
wilderness
that
cometh
out
the
border
the
Amorites
for
the

the

between

Numbers
Wherefore
said

book
the
Wars
Jehovah
Vaheb
Suphah
And
the

the
Arnon
Numbers
And
the

That

And

Numbers
And
from
thence
they
journeyed
Beer
that
the
well
whereof
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Gather
the
people
together
and
will
give
them
water
Numbers
Then
sang
Israel
this
song
Spring
well
sing
unto
Numbers
The
well
which
the
princes
digged
Which
the
nobles
the
people
delved
With
the
sceptre
and
with
their
staves
And
from
the
wilderness
they
journeyed
Mattanah
Numbers
and
from
Mattanah
Nahaliel
and
from

Bamoth
Numbers
and
from
Bamoth
the
valley
that
the
field
Moab
the

Pisgah
which
looketh
down
upon
the
desert
Numbers
And
Israel
sent
messengers
unto
Sihon
king
the
Amorites
saying
Numbers
Let

through
thy
land

not
turn
aside
into
field
into
vineyard
will
not
drink
the
water
the
wells
will
the
king
highway
until

passed
thy
border
Numbers
And
Sihon
would
not
suffer
Israel
pass
through
his
border
but
Sihon
gathered
all
his
people
together
and
went
out
against
Israel
into
the
wilderness
and
came
Jahaz
and
fought
against
Israel
Numbers
And
Israel
smote
him
with
the
edge
the
sword
and
possessed
his
land
from
the
Arnon
unto
the
Jabbok
even
unto
the
children
Ammon
for
the
border
the
children
Ammon
was
strong
Numbers
And
Israel
took
all
these
cities
and
Israel
dwelt
all
the
cities
the
Amorites
Heshbon
and
all
the
towns
thereof
Numbers
For
Heshbon
was
the
city
Sihon
the
king
the
Amorites
who
had
fought
against
the
former
king
Moab
and
taken
all
his
land
out
his
hand
even
unto
the
Arnon
Numbers
Wherefore
they
that
speak
proverbs
say
Come
Heshbon
Let
the
city
Sihon

and
established
Numbers
For

gone
out
Heshbon

Sihon
hath
devoured
Moab
The

Numbers
Woe

And
his

Unto

the
Amorites
Numbers

them
Heshbon
perished
even
unto
Dibon
And
have
laid
waste
even
unto
Nophah
Which
reacheth
unto
Medeba
Numbers
Thus
Israel
dwelt
the
land
the
Amorites
Numbers
And
Moses
sent
spy
out
Jazer
and
they
took
the
towns
thereof
and
drove
out
the
Amorites
that
were
there
Numbers
And
they

and
went

and
the
king
Bashan
went

against
them
and
all
his
people

Edrei
Numbers
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Moses
Fear
him
not
for

and
his
land
and
thou

unto
Sihon
king
the
Amorites
who
dwelt
Heshbon
Numbers
they
smote
him
and
his
sons
and
all
his
people
until
there
was
none
left
him
remaining
and
they
possessed
his
land
Numbers
And
the
children
Israel
journeyed
and
encamped
the
plains
Moab
beyond
the
Jordan
Jericho
Numbers
And
Balak
the
son
Zippor
saw
all
that
Israel
had
done
the
Amorites
Numbers
And
Moab
was
sore
afraid
the
people
because
they
were
many
and
Moab
was
distressed
because
the
children
Israel
Numbers
And
Moab
said
unto
the
elders
Midian
Now
will
this
multitude
lick
all
that
round
about
the
licketh
the
grass
the
field
And
Balak
the
son
Zippor
was
king
Moab
that
time
Numbers
And
sent
messengers
unto
Balaam
the
son
Beor
Pethor
which
the

his

him
saying
Behold

the
earth
and
they

Come
now
therefore
pray
thee
curse
this
people
for
they
are
too
mighty
for
peradventure
shall
prevail
that

smite
them
and
that
may
drive
them
out
the
land
for
know
that
whom
thou
blessest
blessed
and
whom
thou
cursest
cursed
Numbers
And
the
elders
Moab
and
the
elders
Midian
departed
with
the
rewards
divination
their
hand
and
they
came
unto
Balaam
and
spake
unto
him
the
words
Balak
Numbers
And
said
unto
them
Lodge

this
night
and
will
bring
you
word
again
Jehovah

the
princes
Moab
abode
with
Balaam
Numbers
And
God
came
unto
Balaam
and
said
What
men
are
these
with
thee
Numbers
And
Balaam
said
unto
God
Balak
the
son
Zippor
king
Moab
hath
sent
unto
saying
Numbers
Behold
the
people
that

earth
now
come
curse
them
peradventure

fight
against
them
and
shall
drive
them
out
Numbers
And
God
said
unto
Balaam
Thou
shalt
not
with
them
thou
shalt
not
curse
the
people
for
they
are
blessed
Numbers
And
Balaam
rose
the
morning
and
said
unto
the
princes
Balak
Get
you
into
your
land
for
Jehovah
refuseth
give
leave
with
you
Numbers
And
the
princes
Moab
rose
and
they
went
unto
Balak
and
said
Balaam
refuseth
come
with
Numbers
And
Balak
sent
yet
again
princes
more
and
more
honorable
than
they
Numbers
And
they
came
Balaam
and
said
him
Thus
saith
Balak
the
son
Zippor
Let
nothing
pray
thee
hinder
thee
from
coming
unto
Numbers
for
will
promote
thee
unto
very
great
honor
and
whatsoever
thou
sayest
unto
will
come
therefore
pray
thee
curse
this
people
Numbers
And
Balaam
answered
and
said
unto
the
servants
Balak
Balak
would
give
his
house
full
silver
and
gold
cannot
beyond
the
word
Jehovah
God
less
more
Numbers
Now
therefore
pray
you
tarry
also
here
this
night
that
may
know
what
Jehovah
will
speak
unto
more
Numbers
And
God
came
unto
Balaam
night
and
said
unto
him
the
men
are
come
call
thee
rise
with
them
but
only
the
word
which
speak
unto
thee
that
shalt
thou
Numbers
And
Balaam
rose
the
morning
and
saddled
his
ass
and
went
with
the
princes
Moab
Numbers
And
God
anger
was
kindled
because
went
and
the
angel
Jehovah
placed
himself
the
way
for
adversary
against
him
Now
was
riding
upon
his
ass
and
his
two
servants
were
with
him
Numbers
And
the
ass
saw
the
angel
Jehovah
standing
the
way
with
his
sword
drawn
his
hand
and
the
ass
turned
aside
out
the
way
and
went
into
the
field
and
Balaam
smote
the
ass
turn
her
into
the
way
Numbers
Then
the
angel
Jehovah
stood
narrow
path
between
the
vineyards
wall
being
this
side
and
wall
that
side
Numbers
And
the
ass
saw
the
angel
Jehovah
and
she
thrust
herself
unto
the
wall
and
crushed
Balaam
foot
against
the
wall
and
smote
her
again
Numbers
And
the
angel
Jehovah
went
further
and
stood

Jehovah
and
she
lay
down
under
Balaam
and
Balaam
anger
was
kindled
and
smote
the
ass
with
his
staff
Numbers
And
Jehovah
opened
the
mouth
the
ass
and
she
said
unto
Balaam
What
have
done
unto
thee
that
thou
hast
smitten
these
three
times
Numbers
And
Balaam
said
unto
the
ass
Because
thou
hast
mocked
would
there
were
sword

for
now
had
killed
thee
Numbers
And
the
ass
said
unto
Balaam
not

ass
upon
which
thou
hast
ridden
all
thy
life
long
unto
this
day
was
ever
wont
unto
thee
and
said
Nay
Numbers
Then
Jehovah
opened
the
eyes
Balaam
and
saw
the
angel
Jehovah
standing
the
way
with
his
sword
drawn
his
hand
and
bowed
his
head
and
fell

face
Numbers
And
the
angel
Jehovah
said
unto
him
Wherefore
hast
thou
smitten
thine
ass
these
three
times
behold
come
forth
for
adversary
because

way

Numbers
and
the
ass

and
turned
aside
before
these
three
times
unless
she
had
turned
aside
from
surely
now
had
even
slain
thee
and
saved
her
alive
Numbers
And
Balaam
said
unto
the
angel
Jehovah
have
sinned
for
knew
not
that
thou
stoodest
the
way
against
now
therefore
displease
thee
will
get
back
again
Numbers
And
the
angel
Jehovah
said
unto
Balaam
with
the
men
but
only
the
word
that
shall
speak
unto
thee
that
thou
shalt
speak

And

And
Balaam

Balak
and
they
came
unto
Kiriath
huzoth
Numbers
And
Balak
sacrificed
oxen
and
sheep
and
sent

And

For

and
brought

Now

Numbers
the

saying

said
have

favor

let

Numbers
And
Moses
said
unto
the
children
Gad
and
the
children
Reuben
Shall
your
brethren

war
and
shall
sit
here
Numbers
And
wherefore
discourage
the
heart
the
children
Israel
from
going
over
into
the
land
which
Jehovah
hath
given
them
Numbers
Thus
did
your
fathers
when
sent
them
from
Kadesh
barnea
see
the
land
Numbers
For
when
they
went
unto
the
valley
Eshcol
and
saw
the
land
they
discouraged
the
heart
the
children
Israel
that
they
should
not

the
land
which
Jehovah
had
given
them
Numbers
And
Jehovah
anger
was
kindled
that
day
and
sware
saying
Numbers
Surely
none
the
men
that
came
out
Egypt
from
twenty
years
old
and
upward
shall
see
the
land
which
sware
unto
Abraham
unto
Isaac
and
unto
Jacob
because
they
have
not
wholly
followed
Numbers
save
Caleb
the
son
Jephunneh
the
Kenizzite
and
Joshua
the
son
Nun
because
they
have
wholly
followed
Jehovah
Numbers
And
Jehovah
anger
was
kindled
against
Israel
and
made
them
wander
and
fro
the
wilderness
forty
years
until
all
the
generation
that
had
done
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
was
consumed
Numbers
And
behold
are
risen
your
fathers
stead
increase
sinful
men
augment
yet
the
fierce
anger
Jehovah
toward
Israel
Numbers
For
turn
away
from
after
him
will
yet
again
leave
them
the
wilderness
and
will
destroy
all
this
people
Numbers
And
they
came
near
unto
him
and
said
will
build
sheepfolds
here
for
our
cattle
and
cities

our
little

Numbers
but

not
return

Israel
have
inherited
every

his

For

them
the
other

forward
because

And

you
will

Numbers

Deuteronomy
that
thou
mayest
enter
into

Jehovah
thy

which
Jehovah
thy

maketh
with

this

Abraham
Isaac
and

Deuteronomy
Neither
with

Deuteronomy
but
with
him
that

here
with

before
Jehovah
our

and
also
with
him
that
not
here
with

Deuteronomy
for

how

seen
their
abominations
and
their

turneth
away
this

from
Jehovah
our
God
serve
the
gods
those

lest
there
should
among
you
root
that
beareth
gall
and
wormwood
Deuteronomy
and
come
pass
when
heareth
the
words
this
curse
that

himself
his

saying
shall
have
peace
though
walk
the
stubbornness

destroy
the

Deuteronomy
Jehovah
will
not
pardon
him
but
then
the
anger
Jehovah
and
his
jealousy
will
smoke
against
that
man
and
all
the
curse
that
written
this
book
shall
lie
upon
him
and
Jehovah
will
blot
out
his
name
from
under
heaven
Deuteronomy
And
Jehovah
will
set
him
apart
unto
evil
out
all
the
tribes
Israel
according
all
the
curses
the

that
written
this

Deuteronomy
And
the

come
your

that

rise
after

land
shall
say
when
they
see
the
plagues
that
land
and
the

wherewith
Jehovah
hath
made
sick
Deuteronomy

that
the
whole
land
thereof
brimstone

salt

groweth
therein
like
the

Gomorrah
Admah
and
Zeboiim
which
Jehovah
overthrew
his
anger
and
his
wrath
Deuteronomy
even
all
the
nations
shall
say
Wherefore
hath
Jehovah
done
thus
unto
this
land
what
meaneth
the
heat
this
great
anger
Deuteronomy
Then
men
shall
say
Because
they
forsook
the
covenant
Jehovah
the
God
their
fathers
which
made
with
them
when

them
forth
out
the

Egypt

went
and
served
other
gods
and
worshipped
them
gods
that
they
knew
not

therefore
the
anger
Jehovah
was
kindled
against

upon
all
the

that
written

Jehovah
rooted

And
was
told
the

Jericho
saying
Behold
there
came
men
hither
night
the

Israel
search
out

Joshua
And
the

Jericho
sent
unto

saying
Bring

the
men
that

come
thee
that

entered
into
thy
house
for
they
are
come
search
out
all

Joshua
And
the

took
the
two
men
and
hid
them
and
she
said
Yea
the

came
unto

knew
not
whence
they
were

not
pursue

But
she
had
brought
them

roof
and
hid
them
with
the
stalks
flax
which
she
had
laid
order
upon
the
roof
Joshua
And
the
men
pursued
after
them
the
way
the
Jordan
unto
the
fords
and
soon
they
that
pursued
after
them
were
gone
out
they
shut
the
gate
Joshua
And
before
they
were
laid
down
she
came
unto
them
upon
the
roof
Joshua
and
she
said
unto
the
men
know
that
Jehovah
hath
given
you
the
land
and
that
the
fear
you
fallen
upon
and
that
all
the
inhabitants
the
land
melt
away
before
you
Joshua
For
have
heard
how
Jehovah
dried
the
water
the
Red
Sea
before
you
when
came
out
Egypt
and
what
did
unto
the
two
kings
the
Amorites
that
were
beyond
the
Jordan
unto
Sihon
and

utterly
destroyed
Joshua
And
soon
had
heard
our
hearts
did
melt
neither
did
there
remain
any
more
spirit
any
man
because
you
for
Jehovah
your
God
God
heaven
above
and
earth
beneath
Joshua
Now
therefore
pray
you
swear
unto
Jehovah
since
have
dealt
kindly
with
you
that
also
will
deal
kindly
with
father
house
and
give
true
token
Joshua
and
that
will
save
alive
father
and
mother
and
brethren
and
sisters
and
all
that
they
have
and
will
deliver
our
lives
from
death
Joshua
And
the
men
said
unto
her
Our
life
for
yours
utter
not
this
our
business
and
shall
when
Jehovah
giveth
the
land
that
will
deal
kindly
and
truly
with
thee
Joshua
Then
she
let
them
down
cord
through
the
window
for
her
house
was
upon
the
side
the
wall
and
she
dwelt
upon
the
wall
Joshua
And
she
said
unto
them
Get
you
the
mountain
lest
the
pursuers
light
upon
you
and
hide
yourselves
there
three
days
until
the
pursuers
returned
and
afterward

And
the
men
said
unto
her
will
guiltless
this
thine
oath
which
thou
hast
made
swear
Joshua
Behold
when
come
into
the

thou
shalt
bind
this
line

thread

window
which
thou
didst
let
down
and
thou
shalt
gather
unto
thee
into
the
house
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
and
all
thy
father
household
Joshua
And
shall
that
whosoever
shall
out
the
doors
thy
house
into
the
street
his
blood
shall
upon
his
head
and
shall
guiltless
and
whosoever
shall
with
thee
the
house
his
blood
shall
our
head
any
hand

him
Joshua
But
thou
utter
this
our
business
then
shall
guiltless
thine
oath
which
thou
hast
made
swear
Joshua
And
she
said
According
unto
your
words
And
she
sent
them
away
and
they
departed
and
she
bound
the
scarlet
line
the
window
Joshua
And
they
went
and
came
unto
the
mountain
and
abode
there
three
days
until
the
pursuers
were
returned
and
the
pursuers
sought
them
throughout
all
the
way
but
found
them
not
Joshua
Then
the
two
men
returned
and
descended
from
the
mountain
and
passed
over
and
came
Joshua
the
son
Nun
and
they
told
him
all
that
had
befallen
them
Joshua
And
they
said
unto
Joshua
Truly
Jehovah
hath
delivered
into
our
hands
all
the
land
and
moreover
all
the
inhabitants
the
land
melt
away
before
Joshua
And
Joshua
rose
early
the
morning
and
they
removed
from
Shittim
and
came
the
Jordan
and
all
the
children
Israel
and
they
lodged
there
before
they
passed
over
Joshua
And
came
pass
after
three
days
that
the
officers
went
through
the
midst
the
camp
Joshua
and
they
commanded
the
people
saying
When
see
the
ark
the
covenant
Jehovah
your
God
and
the
priests
the
Levites
bearing
then
shall
remove
from
your
place
and
after
Joshua
Yet
there
shall
space
between
you
and
about
two
thousand
cubits
measure
come
not
near
unto
that
may
know
the
way
which
must
for
have
not
passed
this
way
heretofore
Joshua
And
Joshua
said
unto
the
people
Sanctify
yourselves
for
morrow
Jehovah
will
wonders
among
you
Joshua
And
Joshua
spake
unto
the
priests
saying
Take
the
ark
the
covenant
and
pass
over
before
the
people
And
they
took
the
ark
the
covenant
and
went
before
the
people
Joshua
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Joshua
This
day
will
begin
magnify
thee
the
sight
all
Israel
that
they
may
know
that
was
with
Moses
will
with
thee
Joshua
And
thou
shalt
command
the
priests
that
bear
the
ark
the
covenant
saying
When
are
come
the
brink
the
waters
the
Jordan
shall
stand
still
the
Jordan
Joshua
And
Joshua
said
unto
the
children
Israel
Come
hither
and
hear
the
words
Jehovah
your
God
Joshua
And
Joshua
said
Hereby
shall
know
that
the
living
God
among
you
and
that
will
without
fail
drive
out
from
before
you
the
Canaanite
and
the
Hittite
and
the
Hivite
and
the
Perizzite
and
the
Girgashite
and
the
Amorite
and
the
Jebusite
Joshua
Behold
the
ark
the
covenant
the
Lord
all
the
earth
passeth
over
before
you
into
the
Jordan
Joshua
Now
therefore
take
you
twelve
men
out
the
tribes
Israel
for
every
tribe
man
Joshua
And
shall
come
pass
when
the
soles
the
feet
the
priests
that
bear
the
ark
Jehovah
the
Lord
all
the
earth
shall
rest
the
waters
the
Jordan
that
the
waters
the
Jordan
shall
cut
off
even
the
waters
that
come
down
from
above
and
they
shall
stand
one
heap
Joshua
And
came
pass
when
the
people
removed
from
their
tents
pass
over
the
Jordan
the
priests
that
bare
the
ark
the
covenant
being
before
the
people
Joshua
and
when
they
that
bare
the
ark
were
come
unto
the
Jordan
and
the
feet
the
priests
that
bare
the
ark
were
dipped
the
brink
the
water
for
the
Jordan
overfloweth
all
its
banks
all
the
time
harvest
Joshua
that
the
waters
which
came
down
from
above
stood
and
rose
one
heap
great
way
off
Adam
the
city
that
beside
Zarethan
and
those
that
went
down
toward
the
sea
the
Arabah
even
the
Salt
Sea
were
wholly
cut
off
and
the
people
passed
over
right
against
Jericho
Joshua
And
the
priests
that
bare
the
ark
the
covenant
Jehovah
stood
firm
dry
ground
the
midst
the
Jordan
and
all
Israel
passed
over
dry
ground
until
all
the
nation
were
passed
clean
over
the
Jordan
Joshua
And
came
pass
when
all
the
nation
were
clean
passed
over
the
Jordan
that
Jehovah
spake
unto
Joshua
saying
Joshua
Take
you
twelve
men
out
the
people
out
every
tribe
man
Joshua
and
command
them
saying
Take
you
hence
out
the
midst
the
Jordan
out
the
place
where
the
priests
feet
stood
firm
twelve
stones
and
carry
them
over
with
you
and
lay
them
down
the
lodging
place
where
shall
lodge
this
night
Joshua
Then
Joshua
called
the
twelve
men
whom
had
prepared
the
children
Israel
out
every
tribe
man
Joshua
and
Joshua
said
unto
them
Pass
over
before
the
ark
Jehovah
your
God
into
the
midst
the
Jordan
and
take
you
every
man
you
stone
upon
his
shoulder
according
unto
the
number
the
tribes
the
children
Israel
Joshua
that
this
may
sign
among
you
that
when
your
children
ask
time
come
saying
What
mean
these
stones
Joshua
then
shall
say
unto
them
Because
the
waters
the
Jordan
were
cut
off
before
the
ark
the
covenant
Jehovah
when
passed
over
the
Jordan
the
waters
the
Jordan
were
cut
off
and
these
stones
shall
for
memorial
unto
the
children
Israel
for
ever
Joshua
And
the
children
Israel
did
Joshua
commanded
and
took
twelve
stones
out
the
midst
the
Jordan
Jehovah
spake
unto
Joshua
according
the
number
the
tribes
the
children
Israel
and
they
carried
them
over
with
them
unto
the
place
where
they
lodged
and
laid
them
down
there
Joshua
And
Joshua
set
twelve
stones
the
midst
the
Jordan
the
place
where
the
feet
the
priests
that
bare
the
ark
the
covenant
stood
and
they
are
there
unto
this
day
Joshua
For
the
priests
that
bare
the
ark
stood
the
midst
the
Jordan
until
everything
was
finished
that
Jehovah
commanded
Joshua
speak
unto
the
people
according
all
that
Moses
commanded
Joshua
and
the
people
hasted
and
passed
over
Joshua
And
came
pass
when
all
the
people
were
clean
passed
over
that
the
ark
Jehovah
passed
over
and
the
priests
the
presence
the
people
Joshua
And
the
children
Reuben
and
the
children
Gad
and
the
half
tribe
Manasseh
passed
over
armed
before
the
children
Israel
Moses
spake
unto
them
Joshua
about
forty
thousand
ready
armed
for
war
passed
over
before
Jehovah
unto
battle
the
plains
Jericho
Joshua
that
day
Jehovah
magnified
Joshua
the
sight
all
Israel
and
they
feared
him
they
feared
Moses
all
the
days
his
life
Joshua
And
Jehovah
spake
unto
Joshua
saying
Joshua
Command
the
priests
that
bear
the
ark
the
testimony
that
they
come
out
the
Jordan
Joshua
Joshua
therefore
commanded
the
priests
saying
Come
out
the
Jordan
Joshua
And
came
pass
when
the
priests
that
bare
the
ark
the
covenant
Jehovah
were
come
out
the
midst
the
Jordan
and
the
soles
the
priests
feet
were
lifted
unto
the
dry
ground
that
the
waters
the
Jordan
returned
unto
their
place
and
went
over
all
its
banks
aforetime
Joshua
And
the
people
came
out
the
Jordan
the
tenth
day
the
first
month
and
encamped
Gilgal
the
east
border
Jericho
Joshua
And
those
twelve
stones
which
they
took
out
the
Jordan
did
Joshua
set
Gilgal
Joshua
And
spake
unto
the
children
Israel
saying
When
your
children
shall
ask
their
fathers
time
come
saying
What
mean
these
stones
Joshua
then
shall
let
your
children
know
saying
Israel
came
over
this
Jordan
dry
land
Joshua
For
Jehovah
your
God
dried
the
waters
the
Jordan
from
before
you
until
were
passed
over
Jehovah
your
God
did
the
Red
Sea
which
dried
from
before
until
were
passed
over
Joshua
that
all
the
peoples
the
earth
may
know
the
hand
Jehovah
that
mighty
that
may
fear
Jehovah
your
God
for
ever
Joshua
And
came
pass
when
all
the
kings
the
Amorites
that
were
beyond
the
Jordan
westward
and
all
the
kings
the
Canaanites
that
were
the
sea
heard
how
that
Jehovah
had
dried
the
waters
the
Jordan
from
before
the
children
Israel
until
were
passed
over
that
their
heart
melted
neither
was
there
spirit
them
any
more
because
the
children
Israel
Joshua
that
time
Jehovah
said
unto
Joshua
Make
thee
knives
flint
and
circumcise
again
the
children
Israel
the
second
time
Joshua
And
Joshua
made
him
knives
flint
and
circumcised
the
children
Israel
the
hill
the
foreskins
Joshua
And
this
the
cause
why
Joshua
did
circumcise
all
the
people
that
came
forth
out
Egypt
that
were
males
even
all
the
men
war
died
the
wilderness
the
way
after
they
came
forth
out
Egypt
Joshua
For
all
the
people
that
came
out
were
circumcised
but
all
the
people
that
were
born
the
wilderness
the
way
they
came
forth
out
Egypt
they
had
not
circumcised
Joshua
For
the
children
Israel
walked
forty
years
the
wilderness
till
all
the
nation
even
the
men
war
that
came
forth
out
Egypt
were
consumed
because
they
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
Jehovah
unto
whom
Jehovah
sware
that
would
not
let
them
see
the
land
which
Jehovah
sware
unto
their
fathers
that
would
give
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
Joshua
And
their
children
whom
raised
their
stead
them
did
Joshua
circumcise
for
they
were
uncircumcised
because
they
had
not
circumcised
them
the
way
Joshua
And
came
pass
when
they
had
done
circumcising
all
the
nation
that
they
abode
their
places
the
camp
till
they
were
whole
Joshua
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Joshua
This
day
have
rolled
away
the
reproach
Egypt
from
off
you
Wherefore
the
name
that
place
was
called
Gilgal
unto
this
day
Joshua
And
the
children
Israel
encamped
Gilgal
and
they
kept
the
passover
the
fourteenth
day
the
month
even
the
plains
Jericho
Joshua
And
they
did
eat
the
produce
the
land
the
morrow
after
the
passover
unleavened
cakes
and
parched
grain
the
selfsame
day
Joshua
And
the
manna
ceased
the
morrow
after
they
had
eaten
the
produce
the
land
neither
had
the
children
Israel
manna
any
more
but
they
did
eat
the
fruit
the
land
Canaan
that
year
Joshua
And
came
pass
when
Joshua
was
Jericho
that
lifted
his
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
there
stood
man
over
against
him
with
his
sword
drawn
his
hand
and
Joshua
went
unto
him
and
said
unto
him
Art
thou
for
for
our
adversaries
Joshua
And
said
Nay
but
prince
the
host
Jehovah
now
come
And
Joshua
fell
his
face
the
earth
and
did
worship
and
said
unto
him
What
saith
lord
unto
his
servant
Joshua
And
the
prince
Jehovah
host
said
unto
Joshua
Put
off
thy
shoe
from
off
thy
foot
for
the
place
whereon
thou
standest
holy
And
Joshua
did
Joshua
Now
Jericho
was
straitly
shut
because
the
children
Israel
none
went
out
and
none
came
Joshua
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Joshua
See
have
given
into
thy
hand
Jericho
and
the
king
thereof
and
the
mighty
men
valor
Joshua
And
shall
compass
the
city
all
the
men
war
going
about
the
city
once
Thus
shalt
thou
six
days
Joshua
And
seven
priests
shall
bear
seven
trumpets
rams
horns
before
the
ark
and
the
seventh
day
shall
compass
the
city
seven
times
and
the
priests
shall
blow
the
trumpets
Joshua
And
shall
that
when
they
make
long
blast
with
the
ram
horn
and
when
hear
the
sound
the
trumpet
all
the
people
shall
shout
with
great
shout
and
the
wall
the
city
shall
fall
down
flat
and
the
people
shall
every
man
straight
before
him
Joshua
And
Joshua
the
son
Nun
called
the
priests
and
said
unto
them
Take
the
ark
the
covenant
and
let
seven
priests
bear
seven
trumpets
rams
horns
before
the
ark
Jehovah
Joshua
And
they
said
unto
the
people
Pass
and
compass
the
city
and
let
the
armed
men
pass
before
the
ark
Jehovah
Joshua
And
was
that
when
Joshua
had
spoken
unto
the
people
the
seven
priests
bearing
the
seven
trumpets
rams
horns
before
Jehovah
passed
and
blew
the
trumpets
and
the
ark
the
covenant
Jehovah
followed
them
Joshua
And
the
armed
men
went
before
the
priests
that
blew
the
trumpets
and
the
rearward
went
after
the
ark
the
priests
blowing
the
trumpets
they
went
Joshua
And
Joshua
commanded
the
people
saying
shall
not
shout
nor
let
your
voice
heard
neither
shall
any
word
proceed
out
your
mouth
until
the
day
bid
you
shout
then
shall
shout
Joshua
caused
the
ark
Jehovah
compass
the
city
going
about
once
and
they
came
into
the
camp
and
lodged
the
camp
Joshua
And
Joshua
rose
early
the
morning
and
the
priests
took
the
ark
Jehovah
Joshua
And
the
seven
priests
bearing
the
seven
trumpets
rams
horns
before
the
ark
Jehovah
went
continually
and
blew
the
trumpets
and
the
armed
men
went
before
them
and
the
rearward
came
after
the
ark
Jehovah
the
priests
blowing
the
trumpets
they
went
Joshua
And
the
second
day
they
compassed
the
city
once
and
returned
into
the
camp
they
did
six
days
Joshua
And
came
pass
the
seventh
day
that
they
rose
early
the
dawning
the
day
and
compassed
the
city
after
the
same
manner
seven
times
only
the
day
they
compassed
the
city
seven
times
Joshua
And
came
pass
the
seventh
time
when
the
priests
blew
the
trumpets
Joshua
said
unto
the
people
Shout
for
Jehovah
hath
given
you
the
city
Joshua
And
the
city
shall
devoted
even
and
all
that
therein
Jehovah
only
Rahab
the
harlot
shall
live
she
and
all
that
are
with
her
the
house
because
she
hid
the
messengers
that
sent
Joshua
But
for
you
only
keep
yourselves
from
the
devoted
thing
lest
when
have
devoted
take
the
devoted
thing
would
make
the
camp
Israel
accursed
and
trouble
Joshua
But
all
the
silver
and
gold
and
vessels
brass
and
iron
are
holy
unto
Jehovah
they
shall
come
into
the
treasury
Jehovah
Joshua
the
people
shouted
and
the
priests
blew
the
trumpets
and
came
pass
when
the
people
heard
the
sound
the
trumpet
that
the
people
shouted
with
great
shout
and
the
wall
fell
down
flat
that
the
people
went
into
the
city
every
man
straight
before
him
and
they
took
the
city
Joshua
And
they
utterly
destroyed
all
that
was
the
city
both
man
and
woman
both
young
and
old
and
and
sheep
and
ass
with
the
edge
the
sword
Joshua
And
Joshua
said
unto
the
two
men
that
had
spied
out
the
land
into
the
harlot
house
and
bring
out
thence
the
woman
and
all
that
she
hath
sware
unto
her
Joshua
And
the
young
men
the
spies
went
and
brought
out
Rahab
and
her
father
and
her
mother
and
her
brethren
and
all
that
she
had
all
her
kindred
also
they
brought
out
and
they
set
them
without
the
camp
Israel
Joshua
And
they
burnt
the
city
with
fire
and
all
that
was
therein
only
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
vessels
brass
and
iron
they
put
into
the
treasury
the
house
Jehovah
Joshua
But
Rahab
the
harlot
and
her
father
household
and
all
that
she
had
did
Joshua
save
alive
and
she
dwelt
the
midst
Israel
unto
this
day
because
she
hid
the
messengers
whom
Joshua
sent
spy
out
Jericho
Joshua
And
Joshua
charged
them
with
oath
that
time
saying
Cursed
the
man
before
Jehovah
that
riseth
and
buildeth
this
city
Jericho
with
the
loss
his
first
born
shall
lay
the
foundation
thereof
and
with
the
loss
his
youngest
son
shall
set
the
gates
Joshua
Jehovah
was
with
Joshua
and
his
fame
was
all
the
land
Joshua
But
the
children
Israel
committed
trespass
the
devoted
thing
for
Achan
the
son
Carmi
the
son
Zabdi
the
son
Zerah
the
tribe
Judah
took
the
devoted
thing
and
the
anger
Jehovah
was
kindled
against
the
children
Israel
Joshua
And
Joshua
sent
men
from
Jericho
which
beside
Beth
aven
the
east
side
Beth
and
spake
unto
them
saying
and
spy
out
the
land
And
the
men
went
and
spied
out
Joshua
And
they
returned
Joshua
and
said
unto
him
Let
not
all
the
people
but
let
about
two
three
thousand
men
and
smite
make
not
all
the
people
toil
thither
for
they
are
but
few
Joshua
there
went
thither
the
people
about
three
thousand
men
and
they
fled
before
the
men
Joshua
And
the
men
smote
them
about
thirty
and
six
men
and
they
chased
them
from
before
the
gate
even
unto
Shebarim
and
smote
them
the
descent
and
the
hearts
the
people
melted
and
became
water
Joshua
And
Joshua
rent
his
clothes
and
fell
the
earth
upon
his
face
before
the
ark
Jehovah
until
the
evening
and
the
elders
Israel
and
they
put
dust
upon
their
heads
Joshua
And
Joshua
said
Alas
Lord
Jehovah
wherefore
hast
thou
all
brought
this
people
over
the
Jordan
deliver
into
the
hand
the
Amorites
cause
perish
would
that
had
been
content
and
dwelt
beyond
the
Jordan
Joshua
Lord
what
shall
say
after
that
Israel
hath
turned
their
backs
before
their
enemies
Joshua
For
the
Canaanites
and
all
the
inhabitants
the
land
will
hear
and
will
compass
round
and
cut
off
our
name
from
the
earth
and
what
wilt
thou
for
thy
great
name
Joshua
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Joshua
Get
thee
wherefore
art
thou
thus
fallen
upon
thy
face
Joshua
Israel
hath
sinned
yea
they
have
even
transgressed
covenant
which
commanded
them
yea
they
have
even
taken
the
devoted
thing
and
have
also
stolen
and
dissembled
also
and
they
have
even
put
among
their
own
stuff
Joshua
Therefore
the
children
Israel
cannot
stand
before
their
enemies
they
turn
their
backs
before
their
enemies
because
they
are
become
accursed
will
not
with
you
any
more
except
destroy
the
devoted
thing
from
among
you
Joshua
sanctify
the
people
and
say
Sanctify
yourselves
against
morrow
for
thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
There
devoted
thing
the

Israel
thou

until

the
devoted
thing
from

you
Joshua
the
morning
therefore
shall
brought
near
your
tribes
and
shall
that
the
tribe
which
Jehovah
taketh
shall
come
near
families
and
the

take
shall
come
near
households
and
the

Joshua
And
shall
that
that
taken
with
the
devoted
thing
shall
burnt
with
fire
and
all
that
hath
because

transgressed
the
covenant
Jehovah
and
because
hath
wrought
folly
Israel
Joshua
Joshua
rose
early
the
morning
and
brought
Israel
near
their
tribes
and
the
tribe
Judah
was
taken
Joshua
and
brought

and
took

And
Joshua
said
unto
Achan
son

glory
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
and
make
confession
unto
him
and
tell
now
what
thou
hast
done
hide
not
from
Joshua
And
Achan
answered
Joshua
and
said
truth
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
and
thus
and
thus
have
done
Joshua
when
saw
among
the
spoil
goodly
Babylonish
mantle
and
two
hundred
shekels
silver
and
wedge
gold
fifty
shekels
weight
then
coveted
them
and
took
them
and
behold
they
are
hid
the
earth
the
midst
tent
and
the
silver
under
Joshua
Joshua
sent
messengers
and
they
ran
unto
the
tent
and
behold
was
hid
his
tent
and
the
silver
under
Joshua
And
they
took
them
from
the
midst
the
tent
and
brought
them
unto
Joshua
and
unto
all
the
children
Israel
and
they
laid
them
down
before
Jehovah
Joshua
And
Joshua
and
all
Israel
with
him
took
Achan
the
son
Zerah
and
the
silver
and
the
mantle
and
the
wedge
gold
and
his
sons
and
his
daughters
and
his
oxen
and
his
asses
and
his
sheep
and
his
tent
and
all
that
had
and
they
brought
them
unto
the
valley
Achor
Joshua
And
Joshua
said
Why
hast
thou
troubled
Jehovah
shall
trouble
thee
this
day
And
all
Israel
stoned
him
with
stones
and
they
burned
them
with
fire
and
stoned
them
with
stones
Joshua
And
they
raised
over
him
great
heap
stones
unto
this
day
and
Jehovah
turned
from
the
fierceness
his
anger
Wherefore
the
name
that
place
was
called
The
valley
Achor
unto
this
day
Joshua
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Joshua
Fear
not
neither
thou
dismayed
take
all
the
people
war
with
thee
and
arise
see
have
given
into
thy
hand
the
king
and
his
people
and
his
city
and
his
land
Joshua
and
thou
shalt
and
her
king
thou
didst
unto
Jericho
and
her
king
only
the
spoil
thereof
and
the
cattle
thereof
shall
take
for
prey
unto
yourselves
set
thee
ambush
for
the
city
behind
Joshua
Joshua
arose
and
all
the
people
war
and
Joshua
chose
out
thirty
thousand
men
the
mighty
men
valor
and
sent
them
forth
night
Joshua
And
commanded
them
saying
Behold
shall
lie
ambush
against
the
city
behind
the
city
not
very
far
from
the
city
but
all
ready
Joshua
and
and
all
the
people
that
are
with
will
approach
unto
the
city
And
shall
come
pass
when
they
come
out
against
the
first
that
will
flee
before
them
Joshua
and
they
will
come
out
after
till
have
drawn
them
away
from
the
city
for
they
will
say
They
flee
before
the
first
will
flee
before
them
Joshua
and
shall
rise
from
the
ambush
and
take
possession
the
city
for
Jehovah
your
God
will
deliver
into
your
hand
Joshua
And
shall
when
have
seized
upon
the
city
that
shall
set
the
city
fire
according
the
word
Jehovah
shall
see
have
commanded
you
Joshua
And
Joshua
sent
them
forth
and
they
went
the
ambushment
and
abode
between
Beth
and
the
west
side
but
Joshua
lodged
that
night
among
the
people
Joshua
And
Joshua
arose
early
the
morning
and
mustered
the
people
and
went
and
the
elders
Israel
before
the
people
Joshua
And
all
the
people
even
the
men
war
that
were
with
him
went
and
drew
nigh
and
came
before
the
city
and
encamped
the
north
side
now
there
was
valley
between
him
and
Joshua
And
took
about
five
thousand
men
and
set
them
ambush
between
Beth
and
the
west
side
the
city
Joshua
they
set
the
people
even
all
the
host
that
was
the
north
the
city
and
their
liers
wait
that
were
the
west
the
city
and
Joshua
went
that
night
into
the
midst
the
valley
Joshua
And
came
pass
when
the
king
saw
that
they
hasted
and
rose
early
and
the
men
the
city
went
out
against
Israel
battle
and
all
his
people
the
time
appointed
before
the
Arabah
but
knew
not
that
there
was
ambush
against
him
behind
the
city
Joshua
And
Joshua
and
all
Israel
made
they
were
beaten
before
them
and
fled
the
way
the
wilderness
Joshua
And
all
the
people
that
were
the
city
were
called
together
pursue
after
them
and
they
pursued
after
Joshua
and
were
drawn
away
from
the
city
Joshua
And
there
was
not
man
left
Beth
that
went
not
out
after
Israel
and
they
left
the
city
open
and
pursued
after
Israel
Joshua
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Joshua
Stretch
out
the
javelin
that
thy
hand
toward
for
will
give
into
thy
hand
And
Joshua
stretched
out
the
javelin
that
was
his
hand
toward
the
city
Joshua
And
the
ambush
arose
quickly
out
their
place
and
they
ran
soon
had
stretched
out
his
hand
and
entered
into
the
city
and
took
and
they
hasted
and
set
the
city
fire
Joshua
And
when
the
men
looked
behind
them
they
saw
and
behold
the
smoke
the
city
ascended
heaven
and
they
had
power
flee
this
way
that
way
and
the
people
that
fled
the
wilderness
turned
back
upon
the
pursuers
Joshua
And
when
Joshua
and
all
Israel
saw
that
the
ambush
had
taken
the
city
and
that
the
smoke
the
city
ascended
then
they
turned
again
and
slew
the
men
Joshua
And
the
others
came
forth
out
the
city
against
them
they
were
the
midst
Israel
some
this
side
and
some
that
side
and
they
smote
them
that
they
let
none
them
remain
escape
Joshua
And
the
king
they
took
alive
and
brought
him
Joshua
Joshua
And
came
pass
when
Israel
had
made
end
slaying
all
the
inhabitants
the
field
the
wilderness
wherein
they
pursued
them
and
they
were
all
fallen
the
edge
the
sword
until
they
were
consumed
that
all
Israel
returned
unto
and
smote
with
the
edge
the
sword
Joshua
And
all
that
fell
that
day
both
men
and
women
were
twelve
thousand
even
all
the
men
Joshua
For
Joshua
drew
not
back
his
hand
wherewith
stretched
out
the
javelin
until
had
utterly
destroyed
all
the
inhabitants
Joshua
Only
the
cattle
and
the
spoil
that
city
Israel
took
for
prey
unto
themselves
according
unto
the
word
Jehovah
which
commanded
Joshua
Joshua
Joshua
burnt
and
made
heap
for
ever
even
desolation
unto
this
day
Joshua
And
the
king
hanged
tree
until
the
eventide
and
the
going
down
the
sun
Joshua
commanded
and
they
took
his
body
down
from
the
tree
and
cast
the
entrance
the
gate
the
city
and
raised
thereon
great
heap
stones
unto
this
day
Joshua
Then
Joshua
built
altar
unto
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
mount
Ebal
Joshua
Moses
the
servant
Jehovah
commanded
the
children
Israel
written
the
book
the
law
Moses
altar
unhewn
stones
upon
which
man
had
lifted
any
iron
and
they
offered
thereon
burnt
offerings
unto
Jehovah
and
sacrificed
peace
offerings
Joshua
And
wrote
there
upon
the
stones
copy
the
law
Moses
which
wrote
the
presence
the
children
Israel
Joshua
And
all
Israel
and
their
elders
and
officers
and
their
judges
stood
this
side
the
ark
and
that
side
before
the
priests
the
Levites
that
bare
the
ark
the
covenant
Jehovah
well
the
sojourner
the
home
born
half
them
front
mount
Gerizim
and
half
them
front
mount
Ebal
Moses
the
servant
Jehovah
had
commanded
the
first
that
they
should
bless
the
people
Israel
Joshua
And
afterward
read
all
the
words
the
law
the
blessing
and
the
curse
according
all
that
written
the
book
the
law
Joshua
There
was
not
word
all
that
Moses
commanded
which
Joshua
read
not
before
all
the
assembly
Israel
and
the
women
and
the
little
ones
and
the
sojourners
that
were
among
them
Joshua
And
came
pass
when
all
the
kings
that
were
beyond
the
Jordan
the
hill
country
and
the
lowland
and
all
the
shore
the
great
sea
front
Lebanon
the
Hittite
and
the
Amorite
the
Canaanite
the
Perizzite
the
Hivite
and
the
Jebusite
heard
thereof
Joshua
that
they
gathered
themselves
together
fight
with
Joshua
and
with
Israel
with
one
accord
Joshua
But
when
the
inhabitants
Gibeon
heard
what
Joshua
had
done
unto
Jericho
and
Joshua
they
also
did
work
wilily
and
went
and
made
they
had
been
ambassadors
and
took
old
sacks
upon
their
asses
and
wine
skins
old
and
rent
and
bound
Joshua
and
old
and
patched
shoes
upon
their
feet
and
old
garments
upon
them
and
all
the
bread
their
provision
was
dry
and
was
become
mouldy
Joshua
And
they
went
Joshua
unto
the
camp
Gilgal
and
said
unto
him
and
the
men
Israel
are
come
from
far
country
now
therefore
make
covenant
with
Joshua
And
the
men
Israel
said
unto
the
Hivites
Peradventure
dwell
among
and
how
shall
make
covenant
with
you
Joshua
And
they
said
unto
Joshua
are
thy
servants
And
Joshua
said
unto
them
Who
are
and
from
whence
come
Joshua
And
they
said
unto
him
From
very
far
country
thy
servants
are
come
because
the
name
Jehovah
thy
God
for
have
heard
the
fame
him
and
all
that
did
Egypt
Joshua
and
all
that
did
the
two
kings
the
Amorites
that
were
beyond
the
Jordan
Sihon
king
Heshbon
and
king
Bashan
who
was
Ashtaroth
Joshua
And
our
elders
and
all
the
inhabitants
our
country
spake
saying
Take
provision
your
hand
for
the
journey
and
meet
them
and
say
unto
them
are
your
servants
and
now
make
covenant
with
Joshua
This
our
bread
took
hot
for
our
provision
out
our
houses
the
day
came
forth
unto
you
but
now
behold
dry
and
become
mouldy
Joshua
and
these
wine
skins
which
filled
were
new
and
behold
they
are
rent
and
these
our
garments
and
our
shoes
are
become
old
reason
the
very
long
journey
Joshua
And
the
men
took
their
provision
and
asked
not
counsel
the
mouth
Jehovah
Joshua
And
Joshua
made
peace
with
them
and
made
covenant
with
them
let
them
live
and
the
princes
the
congregation
sware
unto
them
Joshua
And
came
pass
the
end
three
days
after
they
had
made
covenant
with
them
that
they
heard
that
they
were
their
neighbors
and
that
they
dwelt
among
them
Joshua
And
the
children
Israel
journeyed
and
came
unto
their
cities
the
third
day
Now
their
cities
were
Gibeon
and
Chephirah
and
Beeroth
and
Kiriath
jearim
Joshua
And
the
children
Israel
smote
them
not
because
the
princes
the
congregation
had
sworn
unto
them
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
And
all
the
congregation
murmured
against
the
princes
Joshua
But
all
the
princes
said
unto
all
the
congregation
have
sworn
unto
them
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
now
therefore
may
not
touch
them
Joshua
This
will
them
and
let
them
live
lest
wrath
upon
because
the
oath
which
sware
unto
them
Joshua
And
the
princes
said
unto
them
Let
them
live
they
became
hewers
wood
and
drawers
water
unto
all
the
congregation
the
princes
had
spoken
unto
them
Joshua
And
Joshua
called
for
them
and
spake
unto
them
saying
Wherefore
have
beguiled
saying
are
very
far
from
you
when
dwell
among
Joshua
Now
therefore
are
cursed
and
there
shall
never
fail
you
bondmen
both
hewers
wood
and
drawers
water
for
the
house
God
Joshua
And
they
answered
Joshua
and
said
Because
was
certainly
told
thy
servants
how
that
Jehovah
thy
God
commanded
his
servant
Moses
give
you
all
the
land
and
destroy
all
the
inhabitants
the
land
from
before
you
therefore
were
sore
afraid
for
our
lives
because
you
and
have
done
this
thing
Joshua
And
now
behold
are
thy
hand
seemeth
good
and
right
unto
thee
unto
Joshua
And
did
unto
them
and
delivered
them
out
the
hand
the
children
Israel
that
they
slew
them
not
Joshua
And
Joshua
made
them
that
day
hewers
wood
and
drawers
water
for
the
congregation
and
for
the
altar
Jehovah
unto
this
day
the
place
which
should
choose
Joshua
Now
came
pass
when
Adoni
zedek
king
Jerusalem
heard
how
Joshua
had
taken
and
had
utterly
destroyed
had
done
Jericho
and
her
king
had
done
and
her
king
and
how
the
inhabitants
Gibeon
had
made
peace
with
Israel
and
were
among
them
Joshua
that
they
feared
greatly
because
Gibeon
was
great
city
one
the
royal
cities
and
because
was
greater
than
and
all
the
men
thereof
were
mighty
Joshua
Wherefore
Adoni
zedek
king
Jerusalem
sent
unto
Hoham
king
Hebron
and
unto
Piram
king
Jarmuth
and
unto
Japhia
king
Lachish
and
unto
Debir
king
Eglon
saying
Joshua
Come
unto
and
help
and
let
smite
Gibeon
for
hath
made
peace
with
Joshua
and
with
the
children
Israel
Joshua
Therefore
the
five
kings
the
Amorites
the
king
Jerusalem
the
king
Hebron
the
king
Jarmuth
the
king
Lachish
the
king
Eglon
gathered
themselves
together
and
went
they
and
all
their
hosts
and
encamped
against
Gibeon
and
made
war
against
Joshua
And
the
men
Gibeon
sent
unto
Joshua
the
camp
Gilgal
saying
Slack
not
thy
hand
from
thy
servants
come
quickly
and
save
and
help
for
all
the
kings
the
Amorites
that
dwell
the
hill
country
are
gathered
together
against
Joshua
Joshua
went
from
Gilgal
and
all
the
people
war
with
him
and
all
the
mighty
men
valor
Joshua
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Joshua
Fear
them
not
for
have
delivered
them
into
thy
hands
there
shall
not
man
them
stand
before
thee
Joshua
Joshua
therefore
came
upon
them
suddenly
for
went
from
Gilgal
all
the
night
Joshua
And
Jehovah
discomfited
them
before
Israel
and
slew
them
with
great
slaughter
Gibeon
and
chased
them
the
way
the
ascent
Beth
horon
and
smote
them
Azekah
and
unto
Makkedah
Joshua
And
came
pass
they
fled
from
before
Israel
while
they
were
the
descent
Beth
horon
that
Jehovah
cast
down
great
stones
from
heaven
upon
them
unto
Azekah
and
they
died
they
were
more
who
died
with
the
hailstones
than
they
whom
the
children
Israel
slew
with
the
sword
Joshua
Then
spake
Joshua
Jehovah
the
day
when
Jehovah
delivered
the
Amorites
before
the
children
Israel
and
said
the
sight
Israel
Sun
stand
thou
still
upon
Gibeon
And
thou
Moon
the
valley
Aijalon
Joshua
And
the
sun
stood
still
and
the
moon
stayed
Until
the
nation
had
avenged
themselves
their
enemies
not
this
written
the
book
Jashar
And
the
sun
stayed
the
midst
heaven
and
hasted
not
down
about
whole
day
Joshua
And
there
was
day
like
that
before
after
that
Jehovah
hearkened
unto
the
voice
man
for
Jehovah
fought
for
Israel
Joshua
And
Joshua
returned
and
all
Israel
with
him
unto
the
camp
Gilgal

that
they
put

hast
thou
given

one
lot
and
one
part
for

seeing
great
people
forasmuch
hitherto
Jehovah
hath
blessed

cut
down
for

there
the
land
the
Perizzites
and
the

spake
unto
the
house

saying
Thou
art

great
power
thou
shalt
not
have

country

For

and
they
you
Joshua
know
for
certainty
that
Jehovah
your
God
will
more
drive
these
nations
from
out
your

but
they
shall
snare
and
trap
unto
you
and
scourge
your
sides
and
thorns
your

until
perish
from
off
this
good
land
which
Jehovah
your

Joshua
And

Joshua
And

will
Jehovah
bring

all
the

Joshua
When

the
covenant
Jehovah
your
God
which
commanded
you
and
and
serve
other
gods
and
bow
down
yourselves
them
then
will
the
anger
Jehovah
kindled
against
you
and
shall
perish
quickly
from
off
the
good
land
which
hath
given
unto
you
Joshua
And
Joshua
gathered
all
the
tribes
Israel
Shechem
and
called
for
the
elders
Israel
and
for
their
heads
and
for
their
judges
and
for
their
officers
and
they
presented
themselves
before
God
Joshua
And
Joshua
said
unto
all
the
people
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Your
fathers
dwelt
old
time
beyond
the
River
even
Terah
the
father
Abraham
and
the
father
Nahor
and
they
served
other
gods
Joshua
And
took
your
father
Abraham
from
beyond
the
River
and
led
him
throughout
all
the
land
Canaan
and
multiplied
his
seed
and
gave
him
Isaac
Joshua
And
gave
unto
Isaac
Jacob
and
Esau
and
gave
unto
Esau
mount
Seir
possess
and
Jacob
and
his
children
went
down
into
Egypt
Joshua
And
sent
Moses
and
Aaron
and
plagued
Egypt
according
that
which
did
the
midst
thereof
and
afterward
brought
you
out
Joshua
And
brought
your
fathers
out
Egypt
and
came
unto
the
sea
and
the
Egyptians
pursued
after
your
fathers
with
chariots
and
with
horsemen
unto
the
Red
Sea
Joshua
And
when
they
cried
out
unto
Jehovah
put
darkness
between
you
and
the
Egyptians
and
brought
the
sea
upon
them
and
covered
them
and
your
eyes
saw
what
did
Egypt
and
dwelt
the
wilderness
many
days
Joshua
And
brought
you
into
the
land
the
Amorites
that
dwelt
beyond
the
Jordan
and
they
fought
with
you
and
gave
them
into
your
hand
and
possessed
their
land
and
destroyed
them
from
before
you
Joshua
Then
Balak
the
son
Zippor
king
Moab
arose
and
fought
against
Israel
and
sent
and
called
Balaam
the
son
Beor
curse
you
Joshua
but
would
not
hearken
unto
Balaam
therefore
blessed
you
still
delivered
you
out
his
hand
Joshua
And
went
over
the
Jordan
and
came
unto
Jericho
and
the
men
Jericho
fought
against
you
the
Amorite
and
the
Perizzite
and
the
Canaanite
and
the
Hittite
and
the
Girgashite
the
Hivite
and
the
Jebusite
and
delivered
them
into
your
hand
Joshua
And
sent
the
hornet
before
you
which
drove
them
out
from
before
you
even
the
two
kings
the
Amorites
not
with
thy
sword
nor
with
thy
bow
Joshua
And
gave
you
land
whereon
thou
hadst
not
labored
and
cities
which
built
not
and
dwell
therein
vineyards
and
oliveyards
which
planted
not
eat
Joshua
Now
therefore
fear
Jehovah
and
serve
him
sincerity
and
truth
and
put
away
the
gods
which
your
fathers
served
beyond
the
River
and
Egypt
and
serve
Jehovah
Joshua
And
seem
evil
unto
you
serve
Jehovah
choose
you
this
day
whom
will
serve
whether
the
gods
which
your
fathers
served
that
were
beyond
the
River
the
gods
the
Amorites
whose
land
dwell
but
for
and
house
will
serve
Jehovah
Joshua
And
the
people
answered
and
said
Far
from
that
should
forsake
Jehovah
serve
other
gods
Joshua
for
Jehovah
our
God
that
brought
and
our
fathers
out
the
land
Egypt
from
the
house
bondage
and
that
did
those
great
signs
our
sight
and
preserved
all
the
way
wherein
went
and
among
all
the
peoples
through
the
midst
whom
passed
Joshua
and
Jehovah
drove
out
from
before
all
the
peoples
even
the
Amorites
that
dwelt
the
land
therefore
also
will
serve
Jehovah
for
our
God
Joshua
And
Joshua
said
unto
the
people
cannot
serve
Jehovah
for
holy
God
jealous
God
will
not
forgive
your
transgression
nor
your
sins
Joshua
forsake
Jehovah
and
serve
foreign
gods
then
will
turn
and
you
evil
and
consume
you
after
that
hath
done
you
good
Joshua
And
the
people
said
unto
Joshua
Nay
but
will
serve
Jehovah
Joshua
And
Joshua
said
unto
the
people
are
witnesses
against
yourselves
that
have
chosen
you
Jehovah
serve
him
And
they
said
are
witnesses
Joshua
Now
therefore
put
away
said
the
foreign
gods
which
are
among
you
and
incline
your
heart
unto
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Joshua
And
the
people
said
unto
Joshua
Jehovah
our
God
will
serve
and
unto
his
voice
will
hearken
Joshua
Joshua
made
covenant
with
the
people
that
day
and
set
them

Joshua
And
Joshua
wrote
these
words
the
book
the
law
God
and
took
great
stone
and
set
there
under
the
oak
that
was
the
sanctuary
Jehovah
Joshua
And
Joshua
said
unto
all
the
people
Behold
this
stone
shall
witness
against
for
hath
heard
all
the
words
Jehovah
which
spake
unto
shall
therefore
witness
against
you
lest
deny
your
God
Joshua
Joshua
sent
the
people
away
every
man
unto
his
inheritance
Joshua
And

Judges
And
came
pass
when
Israel
was
waxed
strong
that
they
put
the
Canaanites
taskwork
and
did
not
utterly
drive
them
out

did
not

out
Judges
Naphtali

dwelt
among
the
Canaanites
the

the

nevertheless
the
inhabitants
Beth
shemesh
and
Beth
anath
became
subject
taskwork
Judges
And
the
Amorites
forced
the
children
Dan
into
the
hill
country
for
they
would
not
suffer
them

down
the
valley
Judges
but
the
Amorites
would
dwell

the

the

prevailed
that
they

Judges
And
the
border
the
Amorites
was
from
the
ascent
Akrabbim
from
the
rock
and
upward
Judges
And
the
angel
Jehovah
came
from
Gilgal
Bochim
And
said
made
you
out
Egypt
and
have
brought
you
unto
the
land
which
sware
unto
your
fathers
and
said
will
never
break
covenant
with
you
Judges
and
shall
make
covenant
with
the
inhabitants
this
land
shall
break
down
their
altars
But
have
not
hearkened
unto
voice
why
have
done
this
Judges
Wherefore
also
said
will
not
drive
them
out
from
before
you
but
they
shall
thorns
your
sides
and
their
gods
shall
snare
unto
you
Judges
And
came
pass
when
the
angel
Jehovah
spake
these
words
unto
all
the
children
Israel
that
the
people
lifted
their
voice
and
wept
Judges
And
they
called
the
name
that
place
Bochim
and
they
sacrificed
there
unto
Jehovah
Judges
Now
when
Joshua
had
sent
the
people
away
the
children
Israel
went
every
man
unto
his
inheritance
possess
the
land
Judges
And
the
people
served
Jehovah
all
the
days
Joshua
and
all
the
days
the
elders
that
outlived
Joshua
who
had
seen
all
the
great
work
Jehovah
that
had
wrought
for
Israel
Judges
And
Joshua
the
son
Nun
the
servant
Jehovah
died
being
hundred
and
ten
years
old
Judges
And
they
buried
him
the
border
his
inheritance
Timnath
heres
the
hill
country
Ephraim
the
north
the
mountain
Gaash
Judges
And
also
all
that
generation
were
gathered
unto
their
fathers
and
there
arose
another
generation
after
them
that
knew
not
Jehovah
nor
yet
the
work
which
had
wrought
for
Israel
Judges
And
the
children
Israel
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
and
served
the
Baalim
Judges
and
they
forsook
Jehovah
the
God
their
fathers
who
brought
them
out
the
land
Egypt
and
followed
other
gods
the
gods
the
peoples
that
were
round
about
them
and
bowed
themselves
down
unto
them
and
they
provoked
Jehovah
anger
Judges
And
they
forsook
Jehovah
and
served
Baal
and
the
Ashtaroth
Judges
And
the
anger
Jehovah
was
kindled
against
Israel
and
delivered
them
into
the
hands
spoilers
that
despoiled
them
and
sold
them
into
the
hands
their
enemies
round
about
that
they
could
not
any
longer
stand
before
their
enemies
Judges
Whithersoever
they
went
out
the
hand
Jehovah
was
against
them
for
evil
Jehovah
had
spoken
and
Jehovah
had
sworn
unto
them
and
they
were
sore
distressed
Judges
And
Jehovah
raised
judges
who
saved
them
out
the
hand
those
that
despoiled
them
Judges
And
yet
they
hearkened
not
unto
their
judges
for
they
played
the
harlot
after
other
gods
and
bowed
themselves
down
unto
them
they
turned
aside
quickly
out
the
way
wherein
their
fathers
walked
obeying
the
commandments
Jehovah
but
they
did
not
Judges
And
when
Jehovah
raised
them
judges
then
Jehovah
was
with
the
judge
and
saved
them
out
the
hand
their
enemies
all
the
days
the
judge
for
repented
Jehovah
because
their
groaning
reason
them
that
oppressed
them
and
vexed
them
Judges
But
came
pass
when
the
judge
was
dead
that
they
turned
back
and
dealt
more
corruptly
than
their
fathers
following
other
gods
serve
them
and
bow
down
unto
them
they
ceased
not
from
their
doings
nor
from
their
stubborn
way
Judges
And
the
anger
Jehovah
was
kindled
against
Israel
and
said
Because
this
nation
have
transgressed
covenant
which
commanded
their
fathers
and
have
not
hearkened
unto
voice
Judges
also
will
not
henceforth
drive
out
any
from
before
them
the
nations
that
Joshua
left
when
died
Judges
that
them
may
prove
Israel
whether
they
will
keep
the
way
Jehovah
walk
therein
their
fathers
did
keep
not
Judges
Jehovah
left
those
nations
without
driving
them
out
hastily
neither
delivered
them
into
the
hand
Joshua
Judges
Now
these
are
the
nations
which
Jehovah
left
prove
Israel
them
even
many
Israel
had
not
known
all
the
wars
Canaan
Judges
only
that
the
generations
the
children
Israel
might
know
teach
them
war
the
least
such
beforetime
knew
nothing
thereof
Judges
namely
the
five
lords
the
Philistines
and
all
the
Canaanites
and
the
Sidonians
and
the
Hivites
that
dwelt
mount
Lebanon
from
mount
Baal
hermon
unto
the
entrance
Hamath
Judges
And
they
were
left
prove
Israel
them
know
whether
they
would
hearken
unto
the
commandments
Jehovah
which
commanded
their
fathers
Moses
Judges
And
the
children
Israel
dwelt
among
the
Canaanites
the
Hittites
and
the
Amorites
and
the
Perizzites
and
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
Judges
and
they
took
their
daughters
their
wives
and
gave
their
own
daughters
their
sons
and
served
their
gods
Judges
And
the
children
Israel
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
and
forgat
Jehovah
their
God
and
served
the
Baalim
and
the
Asheroth
Judges
Therefore
the
anger
Jehovah
was
kindled
against
Israel
and
sold
them
into
the
hand
Cushan
rishathaim
king
Mesopotamia
and
the
children
Israel
served
Cushan
rishathaim
eight
years
Judges
And
when
the
children
Israel
cried
unto
Jehovah
Jehovah
raised
saviour
the
children
Israel
who
saved
them
even
Othniel
the
son
Kenaz
Caleb
younger
brother
Judges
And
the
Spirit
Jehovah
came
upon
him
and
judged
Israel
and
went
out
war
and
Jehovah
delivered
Cushan
rishathaim
king
Mesopotamia
into
his
hand
and
his
hand
prevailed
against
Cushan
rishathaim
Judges
And
the
land
had
rest
forty
years
And
Othniel
the
son
Kenaz
died
Judges
And
the
children
Israel
again
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
and
Jehovah
strengthened
Eglon
the
king
Moab
against
Israel
because
they
had
done
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
Judges
And
gathered
unto
him
the
children
Ammon
and
Amalek
and
went
and
smote
Israel
and
they
possessed
the
city
palm
trees
Judges
And
the
children
Israel
served
Eglon
the
king
Moab
eighteen
years
Judges
But
when
the
children
Israel
cried
unto
Jehovah
Jehovah
raised
them
saviour
Ehud
the
son
Gera
the
Benjamite
man
left
handed
And
the
children
Israel
sent
tribute
him
unto
Eglon
the
king
Moab
Judges
And
Ehud
made
him
sword
which
had
two
edges
cubit
length
and
girded
under
his
raiment
upon
his
right
thigh
Judges
And
offered
the
tribute
unto
Eglon
king
Moab
now
Eglon
was
very
fat
man
Judges
And
when
had
made
end
offering
the
tribute
sent
away
the
people
that
bare
the
tribute
Judges
But
himself
turned
back
from
the
quarries
that
were
Gilgal
and
said
have
secret
errand
unto
thee
king
And
said
Keep
silence
And
all
that
stood
him
went
out
from
him
Judges
And
Ehud
came
unto
him
and
was
sitting
himself
alone
the
cool
upper
room
And
Ehud
said
have
message
from
God
unto
thee
And
arose
out
his
seat
Judges
And
Ehud
put
forth
his
left
hand
and
took
the
sword
from
his
right
thigh
and
thrust
into
his
body
Judges
and
the
haft
also
went
after
the
blade
and
the
fat
closed
upon
the
blade
for
drew
not
the
sword
out
his
body
and
came
out
behind
Judges
Then
Ehud
went
forth
into
the
porch
and
shut
the
doors
the
upper
room
upon
him
and
locked
them
Judges
Now
when
was
gone
out
his
servants
came
and
they
saw
and
behold
the
doors
the
upper
room
were
locked
and
they
said
Surely
covering
his
feet
the
upper
chamber
Judges
And
they
tarried
till
they
were
ashamed
and
behold
opened
not
the
doors
the
upper
room
therefore
they
took
the
key
and
opened
them
and
behold
their
lord
was
fallen
down
dead
the
earth
Judges
And
Ehud
escaped
while
they
tarried
and
passed
beyond
the
quarries
and
escaped
unto
Seirah
Judges
And
came
pass
when
was
come
that
blew
trumpet
the
hill
country
Ephraim
and
the
children
Israel
went
down
with
him
from
the
hill
country
and
before
them
Judges
And
said
unto
them
Follow
after
for
Jehovah
hath
delivered
your
enemies
the
Moabites
into
your
hand
And
they
went
down
after
him
and
took
the
fords
the
Jordan
against
the
Moabites
and
suffered
not
man
pass
over
Judges
And
they
smote
Moab
that
time
about
ten
thousand
men
every
lusty
man
and
every
man
valor
and
there
escaped
not
man
Judges
Moab
was
subdued
that
day
under
the
hand
Israel
And
the
land
had
rest
fourscore
years
Judges
And
after
him
was
Shamgar
the
son
Anath
who
smote
the
Philistines
six
hundred
men
with
goad
and
also
saved
Israel
Judges
And
the
children
Israel
again
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
when
Ehud
was
dead
Judges
And
Jehovah
sold
them
into
the
hand
Jabin
king
Canaan
that
reigned
Hazor
the
captain
whose
host
was
Sisera
who
dwelt
Harosheth
the
Gentiles
Judges
And
the
children
Israel
cried
unto
Jehovah
for
had
nine
hundred
chariots
iron
and
twenty
years
mightily
oppressed
the
children
Israel
Judges
Now
Deborah
prophetess
the
wife
Lappidoth
she
judged
Israel
that
time
Judges
And
she
dwelt
under
the
palm
tree
Deborah
between
Ramah
and
Beth
the
hill
country
Ephraim
and
the
children
Israel
came
her
for
judgment
Judges
And
she
sent
and
called
Barak
the
son
Abinoam
out
Kedesh
naphtali
and
said
unto
him
Hath
not
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
commanded
saying
and
draw
unto
mount
Tabor
and
take
with
thee
ten
thousand
men
the
children
Naphtali
and
the

Judges
And
will
draw
unto
thee
the
river
Kishon
Sisera
the
captain
Jabin
army
with
his
chariots
and
his
multitude
and
will
deliver
him
into
thy
hand
Judges
And
Barak
said
unto
her
thou
wilt
with
then
will
but
thou
wilt
not
with
will
not
Judges
And
she
said
will
surely
with
thee
notwithstanding
the
journey
that
thou
takest
shall
not
for
thine
honor
for
Jehovah
will
sell
Sisera
into
the
hand
woman
And
Deborah
arose
and
went
with
Barak
Kedesh
Judges
And
Barak
called
Zebulun
and
Naphtali
together
Kedesh
and
there
went
ten
thousand
men
his
feet
and
Deborah
went
with
him
Judges
Now
Heber
the
Kenite
had
separated
himself
from
the
Kenites
even
from
the
children
Hobab
the

Moses
and
had
pitched
his

Judges
And
they
told
Sisera
that
Barak
the
son
Abinoam
was
gone

Judges
And
Sisera
gathered
together
all
his
chariots
even
nine
hundred
chariots
iron
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
from
Harosheth
the
Gentiles
unto
the
river
Kishon

And
Deborah
said
unto
Barak
for
this
the
day
which

Jehovah
gone
out
before
thee
Barak
went
down
from
mount
Tabor
and
ten
thousand
men
after
him
Judges
And
Jehovah
discomfited
Sisera
and
all
his
chariots
and
all
his
host
with
the
edge
the
sword
before
Barak
and
Sisera
alighted
from
his
chariot
and
fled
away
his
feet
Judges
But
Barak
pursued
after
the
chariots
and
after
the
host
unto
Harosheth
the
Gentiles
and
all
the
host
Sisera
fell

there
was
not
man
left
Judges
Howbeit
Sisera
fled
away
his
feet

tent
Jael
the
wife
Heber
the
Kenite
for
there
was
peace
between
Jabin
the
king
Hazor
and
the
house
Heber
the
Kenite
Judges
And
Jael
went
out
meet
Sisera
and
said
unto
him
Turn
lord
turn
fear
not
And
turned
unto
her
into
the
tent
and
she
covered
him
with
rug
Judges
And
said
unto
her
Give
pray
thee
little
water
drink
for
thirsty
And
she
opened
bottle
milk
and
gave
him
drink
and
covered
him

And
said
unto
her
Stand

tent
and
shall
when
any
man
doth
come
and
inquire
thee
and
say
there
any

Then
Jael
Heber

took
tent
pin

took
hammer
her
hand
and
went
softly
unto
him

smote
the
pin
into

pierced

Jael
came
out

said
unto
him
Come

unto
her
and

And
came
pass
when
the

cried
unto

because
Midian
Judges
that
Jehovah
sent
prophet
unto
the
children
Israel
and
said
unto
them
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the

brought
you
from

brought
you
forth
out
the
house

Judges
and
delivered
you
out

and
out
the
hand
all
that
oppressed
you
and
drove
them
out
from
before
you
and
gave
you
their

said
unto
you
Jehovah
your
God
shall
not
fear
the
gods
the
Amorites
whose

But
have
not
hearkened
unto

Judges
And
the
angel
Jehovah
came
and
sat
under
the
oak
which
was
Ophrah
that
pertained
unto
Joash
the
Abiezrite
and
his
son
Gideon
was
beating
out
wheat

And
the
angel
Jehovah
appeared
unto
him
and
said
unto

Jehovah
with
thee
thou

And
Gideon
said
unto
him
lord
Jehovah
with
why
then
all
this
befallen
and
where
are
all
his
wondrous
works
which
our

Did

And
Jehovah
looked
upon
him
and
said
this

And
said
unto
him
Lord
wherewith

And
Jehovah
said
unto
him
Surely

with
thee
and
thou
shalt
smite
the
Midianites
one
man
Judges
And
said
unto
him
now

Depart

and
put
the

And
the
angel
God
said
unto
him
Take
the
flesh
and
the
unleavened
cakes
and
lay
them
upon
this
rock
and
pour
out
the

And
did
Judges
Then
the
angel
Jehovah
put
forth
the
end
the
staff
that
was
his
hand
and
touched
the
flesh
and
the
unleavened
cakes
and
there
went
fire
out
the
rock
and
consumed
the
flesh
and
the
unleavened
cakes
and
the
angel
Jehovah
departed
out
his
sight
Judges
And
Gideon
saw
that
was
the
angel
Jehovah
and
Gideon
said
Alas
Lord
Jehovah
forasmuch
have
seen
the
angel
Jehovah
face
face
Judges
And
Jehovah
said
unto
him
Peace
unto
thee
fear
not
thou
shalt
not
die
Judges
Then
Gideon
built
altar
there
unto
Jehovah
and
called
Jehovah
shalom
unto
this
day
yet
Ophrah
the
Abiezrites
Judges
And
came
pass
the
same
night
that
Jehovah
said
unto
him
Take
thy
father
bullock
even
the
second
bullock
seven
years
old
and
throw
down
the
altar
Baal
that
thy

and
build

unto

upon

and
take
the
second
bullock
and
offer
burnt
offering
with
the
wood
the
Asherah
which
thou
shalt
cut
down
Judges
Then
Gideon
took
ten
men
his
servants
and
did
Jehovah
had
spoken
unto
him
and
came
pass
because
feared
his
father
household
and
the
men
the
city
that
could
not
day
that
did
night
Judges
And
when
the
men
the
city
arose
early
the
morning
behold
the
altar
Baal
was
broken
down
and
the
Asherah
was
cut
down
that
was
and
the
second
bullock
was
offered
upon
the
altar
that
was
built
Judges
And
they
said
one
another
Who
hath
done
this
thing
And
when
they
inquired
and
asked
they
said
Gideon
the
son
Joash
hath
done
this
thing
Judges
Then
the
men
the
city
said
unto
Joash
Bring
out
thy
son
that
may
die
because
hath
broken
down
the
altar
Baal
and
because
hath
cut
down
the
Asherah
that
was
Judges
And
Joash
said
unto
all
that
stood
against
him
Will
contend
for
Baal
will
save
him
that
will
contend
for
him
let
him
put
death
whilst
yet
morning
god
let
him
contend
for
himself
because

hath
broken
down

altar
Judges
Therefore
that
day
called
him
Jerubbaal
saying
Let
Baal
contend
against
him
because
hath
broken
down
his
altar
Judges
Then
all
the
Midianites
and
the
Amalekites
and
the
children
the
east
assembled
themselves
together
and
they
passed
over
and
encamped
the
valley
Jezreel
Judges
But
the
Spirit
Jehovah
came
upon
Gideon
and
blew
trumpet
and
Abiezer
was
gathered
together
after
him
Judges
And
sent
messengers
throughout
all
Manasseh
and
they
also
were
gathered
together
after
him
and
sent
messengers
unto
Asher
and
unto
Zebulun
and
unto
Naphtali
and
they
came
meet
them
Judges
And
Gideon
said
unto
God
thou
wilt
save
Israel
hand
thou
hast
spoken
Judges
behold
will
put
fleece

threshing
floor
there

fleece
only
and
dry
upon
all
the
ground
then
shall
know
that
thou
wilt
save
Israel
hand
thou
hast
spoken
Judges
And
was
for
rose
early
the
morrow
and
pressed
the
fleece
together
and
wrung
the
dew
out
the
fleece
bowlful
water
Judges
And
Gideon
said
unto
God
Let
not
thine
anger
kindled
against
and
will
speak
but
this
once
let
make
trial
pray
thee
but
this
once
with
the
fleece
let
now
dry
only
upon
the
fleece
and
upon
all
the
ground
let
there
dew
Judges
And
God
did
that
night
for
was
dry
upon
the
fleece
only
and
there
was
dew
all
the
ground
Judges
Then
Jerubbaal
who
Gideon
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
rose
early
and
encamped
beside
the
spring
Harod
and
the
camp
Midian
was
the
north
side
them
the
hill
Moreh
the
valley
Judges
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Gideon
The
people
that
are
with
thee
are
too
many
for
give
the
Midianites
into
their
hand
lest
Israel
vaunt
themselves
against
saying
Mine
own
hand
hath
saved
Judges
Now
therefore
proclaim
the
ears
the
people
saying
Whosoever
fearful
and
trembling
let
him
return
and
depart
from
mount
Gilead
And
there
returned
the
people
twenty
and
two
thousand
and
there
remained
ten
thousand
Judges
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Gideon
The
people
are
yet
too
many
bring
them
down
unto
the
water
and
will
try
them
for
thee
there
and
shall
that
whom
say
unto
thee
This
shall
with
thee
the
same
shall
with
thee
and
whomsoever
say
unto
thee
This
shall
not
with
thee
the
same
shall
not
Judges
brought
down
the
people
unto
the
water
and
Jehovah
said
unto
Gideon
Every
one
that
lappeth
the
water
with
his
tongue
dog
lappeth
him
shalt
thou
set
himself
likewise
every
one
that
boweth
down
upon
his
knees

Judges
And
the
number
them
that
lapped
putting
their
hand
their
mouth
was
three
hundred
men
but
all
the
rest
the
people
bowed
down
upon
their
knees

water
Judges
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Gideon
the
three
hundred
men
that
lapped
will
save
you
and
deliver
the
Midianites
into
thy
hand
and
let
all
the
people
every
man
unto
his
place
Judges
the
people
took
victuals
their
hand
and
their
trumpets
and
sent
all
the
men
Israel
every
man
unto
his
tent
but
retained
the
three
hundred
men
and
the
camp
Midian
was
beneath
him
the
valley
Judges
And
came
pass
the
same
night
that
Jehovah
said
unto
him
Arise
get
thee
down
into
the
camp
for
have
delivered
into
thy
hand
Judges
But
thou
fear
down
thou
with
Purah
thy
servant
down
the
camp
Judges
and
thou
shalt
hear
what
they
say
and
afterward
shall
thy
hands
strengthened
down
into
the
camp
Then
went
down
with
Purah
his
servant
unto
the
outermost
part
the
armed
men
that
were
the
camp
Judges
And
the
Midianites
and
the
Amalekites
and
all
the
children
the
east
lay
along
the
valley
like
locusts
for
multitude

And
when

and
said
Behold

Midian
and

unto
the
tent
and
smote

and
turned
upside
down
that
the
tent
lay
flat
Judges
And
his
fellow
answered
and
said
This
nothing
else
save
the
sword
Gideon
the
son
Joash
man
Israel
into
his
hand
God
hath
delivered
Midian
and
all
the

And
was
when
Gideon
heard
the
telling
the
dream
and
the
interpretation
thereof
that
worshipped
and
returned
into
the
camp
Israel
and
said
Arise
for
Jehovah
hath
delivered
into
your
hand
the
host
Midian
Judges
And
divided
the
three
hundred
men
into
three
companies
and
put
into
the
hands
all
them
trumpets
and
empty
pitchers
with
torches
within
the
pitchers
Judges
And
said
unto
them
Look

likewise
and
behold
when

Judges
When

all
that

blow
the
trumpets
also
every

and
say
For

Gideon
Judges
Gideon
and
the
hundred
men
that
were
with
him
came
unto
the
outermost
part
the
camp
the
beginning
the
middle
watch
when
they
had
but
newly
set
the

and
they
blew
the
trumpets
and
brake

Judges
And
the
three
companies
blew
the
trumpets
and
brake
the
pitchers
and
held
the
torches
their
left
hands
and
the
trumpets
their
right
hands
wherewith
blow
and
they
cried
The

Jehovah
and
Gideon
Judges
And
they
stood
every
man
his
place
round
about
the
camp
and
all
the
host
ran
and
they
shouted
and
put
them
flight
Judges
And
they
blew
the
three
hundred
trumpets
and
Jehovah
set
every
man
sword
against
his
fellow
and
against
all
the
host

were
gathered
together
out

pursued
after

And
Gideon
sent

they
brought

Judges
And
the
men
Ephraim
said
unto
him
Why
hast
thou
served
thus
that
thou
calledst
not
when
thou
wentest

with
Midian
And
they
did
chide
with
him
sharply
Judges
And
said
unto
them
What
have
now
done
comparison
with
you
not
the
gleaning

Ephraim
better
than

God
hath
delivered

what
was

Then
their
anger
was
abated
toward
him
when

And
Gideon
came

Jordan
and
passed
over

the
three
hundred

And
said
unto
the

Succoth
Give

pursuing
after
Zebah

And
the

Succoth
said
Are
the
hands
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
now
thy
hand
that
should
give
bread
unto
thine
army
Judges
And
Gideon
said
Therefore
when
Jehovah
hath
delivered
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
into
hand
then
will
tear
your
flesh
with
the
thorns
the
wilderness
and
with
briers
Judges
And
went
thence
Penuel
and
spake
unto
them
like
manner

the
men
Penuel
answered
him
the
men
Succoth
had
answered
Judges
And
spake
also
unto
the
men
Penuel
saying
When

them
that

smote
the
host
for
the
host

And
Zebah

fled
and
pursued
after
them
and
took
the
two
kings
Midian
Zebah

discomfited
all

And
came
unto
the
men
Succoth

said
Behold

with
them
taught
the
men
Succoth
Judges
And
brake
down
the

slew
the
men

Then
said
unto
Zebah

And
said
unto
Jether
his
first

them
But
the
youth
drew
not
his

Then
the

Judges
And
Gideon
said
unto
them
would
make
request

give
every
man

For
they
had

And

The

And
Abimelech
was

And
God
sent
evil

Shechem
dealt
treacherously
with

Judges
And
they
went
out
into
the
field

grapes
and
held
festival
and
went
into
the
house

god
and
did
eat

cursed
Abimelech
Judges
And
Gaal
the

Ebed
said
Who
Abimelech

not
the

And
would

this
people
were
under

then
would
remove
Abimelech
And
said
Abimelech
Increase
thine
army
and
come
out
Judges
And
when
Zebul
the
ruler
the
city
heard
the
words
Gaal
the
son
Ebed
his
anger
was
kindled
Judges
And
sent
messengers
unto
Abimelech
craftily
saying
Behold

Judges
And
Abimelech
rose
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
night
and
they
laid

Judges
And

Abimelech
rose
and
the

Judges
And
when
Gaal
saw
the
people
said
Zebul
Behold
there
come
people
down
from
the
tops
the
mountains
And
Zebul
said
unto
him
Thou
seest
the
shadow

Judges
And
Gaal
spake
again
and
said
See
there
come

land
and
one
company
cometh

Judges
Then
said
Zebul
unto
him
Where

serve
him
not

the
people
that
thou

now
pray
and
fight
with

Judges
And
Gaal
went
out
before
the
men
Shechem
and
fought
with
Abimelech
Judges
And
Abimelech
chased
him
and
fled
before
him
and
there
fell
many
wounded
even
unto
the
entrance
the
gate
Judges
And
Abimelech
dwelt
Arumah
and
Zebul
drove
out
Gaal
and
his
brethren
that
they
should
not
dwell

Judges
And
came
pass
the
morrow
that
the

went
out
into

they
told

field
and
looked
and
behold
the
people
came
forth
out

and
rose
against
them
and
smote
them
Judges
And
Abimelech
and
the
companies
that
were
with
him
rushed
forward
and
stood

entrance
the
gate
the
city
and
the
two
companies
rushed
upon
all
that
were

and
smote
them
Judges
And
Abimelech
fought
against
the
city
all
that
day
and
took
the
city
and
slew
the
people
that
were
therein
and
beat
down
the
city
and
sowed
with
salt
Judges
And
when
all
the
men

heard
thereof
they
entered
into
the

the
house
Elberith
Judges
And
was
told
Abimelech
that
all
the
men

were
gathered
together
Judges
And
Abimelech
gat
him
mount
Zalmon
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
and
Abimelech
took
axe
his
hand
and
cut
down
bough
from
the
trees
and
took
and
laid
his
shoulder
and
said
unto
the
people
that
were
with
him
What

seen
make
haste
and
have
done
Judges
And
all
the
people
likewise
cut
down
every
man
his
bough
and
followed
Abimelech
and
put
them

stronghold
and
set
the
stronghold
fire
upon
them
that
all
the
men

died
also
about

Judges
Then
went
Abimelech

and
encamped
against

But
there
was

And
certain

Judges
Then

said
unto
him

him
And
his
young

died
Judges
And
when
the
men
Israel
saw
that
Abimelech
was
dead
they
departed
every
man
unto
his
place
Judges
Thus
God
requited
the
wickedness
Abimelech
which
did
unto
his
father
slaying
his
seventy
brethren
Judges
and
all
the
wickedness
the
men

did
God
requite
upon
their
heads

they
forsook

And
the

Jehovah
was
kindled
against
Israel
and
sold
them
into
the
hand
the
Philistines

into
the
hand
the
children

And
they
vexed

And
the

cried
unto
Jehovah
saying
have
sinned
against
thee
even
because

forsaken
our
God
and
have
served
the
Baalim
Judges
And
Jehovah
said
unto
the
children
Israel
Did
not
save
you
from
the
Egyptians
and
from
the
Amorites
from
the
children
Ammon
and
from
the
Philistines
Judges
The

also
and
the
Amalekites
and
the
Maonites
did
oppress
you
and
cried
unto

Yet

said
unto
Jehovah

this
day
Judges
And

put
away
the
foreign
gods
from

them
and
served
Jehovah
and
his
soul
was
grieved
for
the
misery
Israel
Judges
Then

were
gathered
together
and
encamped

And
the

said
one
another
What
man
that
will
begin
fight
against

children
Ammon
shall
head
over
all
the

Gilead
Judges
Now
Jephthah
the

was
mighty
man

and
was
the
son
harlot

Gilead
begat
Jephthah
Judges
And
Gilead
wife
bare
him
sons
and
when
his
wife
sons
grew
they
drove
out
Jepthah
and
said
unto
him
Thou
shalt
not
inherit
our
father
house
for
thou
art
the
son
another
woman
Judges
Then
Jephthah
fled
from
his
brethren
and
dwelt

and
there
were
gathered
vain
fellows
Jephthah
and
they
went
out
with
him
Judges
And
came
pass
after
while
that
the
children

against
Israel
Judges
And
was
that
when
the
children
Ammon
made
war
against
Israel
the
elders
Gilead
went
fetch
Jephthah
out
the
land
Tob
Judges
and
they
said
unto
Jephthah
Come
and
our
chief
that
may
fight
with
the
children
Ammon
Judges
And
Jephthah
said
unto
the
elders
Gilead
Did

hate
and
drive
out
father
house
and
why
are
come
unto
now
when

Judges
And
the
elders
Gilead
said
unto
Jephthah
Therefore

thou
mayest

fight
with
the

and
thou

And
Jephthah
said
unto
the
elders
Gilead
bring

again
fight
with
the
children
Ammon
and
Jehovah
deliver
them
before

And
the

Gilead
said
unto
Jephthah
Jehovah
shall
witness

will
Judges
Then
Jephthah
went
with
the

spake
all
his
words
before

And
Jephthah
sent
messengers
unto
the
king
the
children
Ammon
saying
What
hast
thou
with
that
thou
art
come
unto
fight
against
land
Judges
And
the
king
the
children
Ammon
answered
unto
the
messengers
Jephthah
Because
Israel
took
away
land
when
came
out
Egypt
from
the
Arnon
even
unto
the
Jabbok
and
unto
the

now
therefore

peaceably
Judges
And
Jephthah
sent

again
unto
the
king
the
children
Ammon

and
said
unto
him
Thus
saith
Jephthah
Israel
took
not
away
the
land
Moab
nor
the
land
the
children
Ammon
Judges
but
when
they
came
from
Egypt
and
Israel
went
through
the
wilderness
unto
the
Red
Sea
and
came
Kadesh
Judges
then
Israel
sent
messengers
unto
the
king
Edom
saying
Let
pray
thee
pass
through
thy
land
but
the
king
Edom
hearkened
not
And
like
manner
sent
unto
the
king
Moab
but
would
not
and
Israel
abode
Kadesh
Judges
Then
they
went
through
the
wilderness
and
went
around
the
land
Edom
and
the
land
Moab
and
came
the
east
side
the
land
Moab
and
they
encamped
the
other
side
the
Arnon
but
they
came
not
within
the
border
Moab
for
the
Arnon
was
the
border
Moab
Judges
And
Israel
sent
messengers
unto
Sihon
king
the
Amorites
the
king
Heshbon
and
Israel
said
unto
him
Let
pass
pray
thee
through
thy
land
unto
place
Judges
But
Sihon
trusted
not
Israel
pass
through
his
border
but
Sihon
gathered
all
his
people
together
and
encamped
Jahaz
and
fought
against
Israel
Judges
And
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
delivered
Sihon
and
all
his
people
into
the
hand
Israel
and
they
smote
them
Israel
possessed
all
the
land
the
Amorites
the
inhabitants
that
country
Judges
And
they
possessed
all
the
border
the
Amorites
from
the
Arnon
even
unto
the
Jabbok
and
from
the
wilderness
even
unto
the
Jordan
Judges
now
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
hath
dispossessed
the
Amorites
from
before
his
people
Israel
and
shouldest
thou
possess
them
Judges
Wilt
not
thou
possess
that
which
Chemosh
thy
god
giveth
thee
possess
whomsoever
Jehovah
our
God
hath
dispossessed
from
before
them
will
possess
Judges
And
now
art
thou
anything
better
than
Balak
the
son
Zippor
king
Moab
did
ever
strive
against
Israel
did
ever
fight
against
them
Judges
While
Israel
dwelt
Heshbon
and
its
towns
and
Aroer
and
its
towns
and
all
the
cities
that
are
along
the
side
the
Arnon
three
hundred
years
wherefore
did
not
recover
them
within
that
time
Judges
therefore
have
not
sinned
against
thee
but
thou
doest
wrong
war
against
Jehovah
the
Judge
judge
this
day
between
the
children
Israel
and
the
children
Ammon
Judges
Howbeit
the
king
the
children
Ammon
hearkened
not
unto
the
words
Jephthah
which
sent
him
Judges
Then
the
Spirit
Jehovah
came
upon
Jephthah
and
passed
over
Gilead
and
Manasseh
and
passed
over
Mizpeh
Gilead
and
from
Mizpeh
Gilead
passed
over
unto
the
children
Ammon
Judges
And
Jephthah
vowed
vow
unto
Jehovah
and
said
thou
wilt
indeed
deliver
the
children
Ammon
into
hand
Judges
then
shall
that
whatsoever
cometh
forth
from
the
doors
house
meet
when
return
peace
from
the
children
Ammon
shall
Jehovah
and
will
offer
for
burnt
offering
Judges
Jephthah
passed
over
unto
the
children
Ammon
fight
against
them
and
Jehovah
delivered
them
into
his
hand
Judges
And
smote
them
from
Aroer
until
thou
come
Minnith
even
twenty
cities
and
unto
Abelcheramim
with
very
great
slaughter
the
children
Ammon
were
subdued
before
the
children
Israel
Judges
And
Jephthah
came
Mizpah
unto
his
house
and
behold
his
daughter
came
out
meet
him
with
timbrels
and
with
dances
and
she
was
his
only
child
besides
her
had
neither
son
nor
daughter
Judges
And
came
pass
when
saw
her
that
rent
his
clothes
and
said
Alas
daughter
thou
hast
brought
very
low
and
thou
art
one
them
that
trouble
for
have
opened
mouth
unto
Jehovah
and
cannot
back
Judges
And
she
said
unto
him
father
thou
hast
opened
thy
mouth
unto
Jehovah
unto
according
that
which
hath
proceeded
out
thy
mouth
forasmuch
Jehovah
hath
taken
vengeance
for
thee
thine
enemies
even
the
children
Ammon
Judges
And
she
said
unto
her
father
Let
this
thing
done
for
let
alone
two
months
that
may
depart
and
down
upon
the
mountains
and
bewail
virginity
and
companions
Judges
And
said
And
sent
her
away
for
two
months
and
she
departed
she
and
her
companions
and
bewailed
her
virginity
upon
the
mountains
Judges
And
came
pass
the
end
two
months
that
she
returned
unto
her
father
who
did
with
her
according
his
vow
which
had
vowed
and
she
knew
not
man
And
was
custom
Israel
Judges
that
the
daughters
Israel
went
yearly
celebrate
the
daughter
Jephthah
the
Gileadite
four
days
year
Judges
And
the
men
Ephraim
were
gathered
together
and
passed
northward
and
they
said
unto
Jephthah
Wherefore
passedst
thou
over
fight
against
the
children
Ammon
and
didst
not
call
with
thee
will
burn
thy
house
upon
thee
with
fire
Judges
And
Jephthah
said
unto
them
and
people
were
great
strife
with
the
children
Ammon
and
when
called
you
saved
not
out
their
hand
Judges
And
when
saw
that
saved
not
put
life
hand
and
passed
over
against
the
children
Ammon
and
Jehovah
delivered
them
into
hand
wherefore
then
are
come
unto
this
day

against
Judges
Then
Jephthah
gathered
together
all
the
men
Gilead
and
fought
with
Ephraim
and
the
men
Gilead
smote
Ephraim
because
they
said

Ephraim
and
the
midst
Manasseh
Judges
And
the
Gileadites
took

Ephraimites
And
was
that
when
any
the
fugitives
Ephraim
said
Let
over
the
men
Gilead
said
unto
him
Art
thou
Ephraimite
said
Nay
Judges
then
said
they
unto
him
Say
now
Shibboleth
and
said
Sibboleth
for
could
not
frame
pronounce
right
then
they
laid
hold
him
and
slew
him

And
there
fell

And
the

did
that
which

and
Jehovah
delivered
them
into

And
there
was
certain
man
Zorah
the
family
the
Danites
whose
name
was
Manoah
and
his
wife
was
barren
and
bare

Judges
And
the
angel
Jehovah
appeared
unto
the
woman
and
said
unto
her
Behold
now
thou
art
barren
and
bearest
not
but
thou
shalt

Judges
Now
therefore

thee
and
drink

for
the
child
shall
Nazirite
unto
God
from
the
womb
and
shall
begin
save
Israel
out
the
hand
the
Philistines
Judges
Then
the
woman
came
and
told
her
husband
saying
man
God
came
unto
and
his
countenance
was
like
the
countenance
the
angel
God
very
terrible
and
asked
him
not
whence
was
neither
told
his
name
Judges
but
said
unto
Behold
thou
shalt
conceive
and
bear

and
now
drink
wine
nor
strong

and
eat
not
any
unclean
thing
for
the
child
shall
Nazirite
unto
God
from
the
womb
the
day
his
death
Judges
Then
Manoah
entreated
Jehovah
and
said
Lord
pray
thee
let
the
man
God
whom
thou
didst
send
come
again
unto
and
teach
what
shall
unto
the
child
that
shall
born
Judges
And
God
hearkened
the
voice
Manoah
and
the
angel
God
came
again
unto
the
woman
she
sat
the
field
but
Manoah
her
husband
was
not
with
her
Judges
And
the
woman
made
haste
and
ran
and
told
her
husband
and
said
unto
him
Behold
the
man
hath
appeared
unto
that
came
unto
the
other
day
Judges
And
Manoah
arose
and
went
after
his
wife
and
came
the
man
and
said
unto
him
Art
thou
the
man
that
spakest
unto
the
woman
And
said
Judges
And
Manoah
said
Now
let
thy
words
come
pass
what
shall
the
ordering
the
child

how
shall

him
Judges
And
the
angel
Jehovah
said
unto
Manoah
all
that
said
unto
the
woman
let
her
beware
Judges
She
may
not
eat
anything
that
cometh

vine
neither
let
her
drink
wine
strong
drink
nor
eat
any
unclean
thing
all
that
commanded
her
let
her
observe
Judges
And
Manoah
said
unto
the
angel
Jehovah
pray
thee
let
detain
thee
that
may
make
ready
kid
for
thee
Judges
And
the
angel
Jehovah
said
unto
Manoah
Though
thou
detain
will
not
eat
thy
bread
and
thou
wilt
make
ready
burnt
offering
thou
must
offer
unto
Jehovah
For
Manoah
knew
not
that
was
the
angel
Jehovah
Judges
And
Manoah
said
unto
the
angel
Jehovah
What
thy
name
that
when
thy
words
come
pass
may
thee
honor
Judges
And
the
angel
Jehovah
said
unto
him
Wherefore
askest
thou
after
name
seeing
wonderful
Judges
Manoah
took
the
kid
with
the
meal
offering
and
offered
upon
the
rock
unto
Jehovah
and
the
angel
did
wondrously
and
Manoah
and
his
wife
looked
Judges
For
came
pass
when
the
flame
went
toward
heaven
from
off
the
altar
that
the
angel
Jehovah
ascended
the
flame
the
altar
and
Manoah
and
his
wife
looked
and
they
fell
their
faces
the
ground
Judges
But
the
angel
Jehovah
did
more
appear
Manoah
his
wife
Then
Manoah
knew
that
was
the
angel
Jehovah
Judges
And
Manoah
said
unto
his
wife
shall
surely
die
because
have
seen
God
Judges
But
his
wife
said
unto
him
Jehovah
were
pleased
kill
would
not
have
received
burnt
offering
and
meal
offering
our
hand
neither
would
have
showed
all
these
things

Judges
And
the
woman

and
called
his

and
Jehovah
blessed
him
Judges
And
the
Spirit

the
Philistines
now
therefore

Judges
Then
his
father
and
his
mother
said
unto
him
there
never

among
the
daughters
thy
brethren
among
all
people
that
thou

And
Samson
said
unto

But
his

Judges
And
came

when
they

And
Samson
said
unto
them
Let

And
she
wept
before

the
seventh
day
that

she
pressed
him

Judges
And
the

city
said
unto
him
the

And

and
took
their
spoil

And
her

therefore
gave

Judges
Then
the
Philistines
said
Who
hath
done
this
And
they
said
Samson
the
son
law
the
Timnite
because

taken
his
wife
and
given
her
his
companion
And
the
Philistines

Judges
And
Samson
said
unto
them
after
this
manner

Judges
And

Then

the
Philistines
And
Samson
said
unto
them
Swear
unto

not
fall
upon
yourselves
Judges
And
they
spake
unto
him
saying
but
will
bind
thee
fast
and
deliver
thee
into
their
hand
but
surely
will
not
kill
thee
And
they
bound
him
with
two
new
ropes
and
brought
him
from
the
rock
Judges
When

unto
Lehi
the
Philistines
shouted

met
him
and
the
Spirit
Jehovah
came
mightily
upon
him
and
the
ropes

And
the

came
unto

and
said
unto

Delilah
said
Samson
Tell

said
unto
her
they
bind

and
another

the
lords
the
Philistines
brought
her
seven
green
withes
which
had
not
been
dried
and
she
bound
him
with
them
Judges
Now
she
had
liers
wait
abiding
the
inner
chamber
And
she
said
unto
him
The
Philistines
are
upon
thee
Samson
And
brake
the
withes
string
tow
broken
when
toucheth
the
fire
his
strength
was
not
known
Judges
And
Delilah
said
unto
Samson
Behold
thou
hast
mocked
and
told
lies
now
tell
pray
thee
wherewith
thou
mightest
bound
Judges
And
said
unto
her
they
only

Judges
Delilah
took
new

and
bound
him
therewith
and
said
unto
him
The
Philistines

Samson
And
the
liers

were
abiding
the
inner
chamber
And
brake
them
off
his

Judges
And
Delilah
said
unto
Samson
Hitherto
thou
hast
mocked
and
told

wherewith
thou
mightest

And
said
unto
her
thou
weavest

Judges
And
she
fastened
with
the

and
said
unto
him
The
Philistines
are
upon
thee
Samson
And
awaked
out
his
sleep
and
plucked
away
the
pin
the

and
the

Judges
And
she
said
unto
him
How
canst
thou
say
love
thee
when
thy
heart
not
with
thou
hast
mocked
these
three
times
and
hast
not
told
wherein
thy
great
strength
lieth
Judges
And
came
pass
when
she
pressed
him
daily
with
her
words
and
urged
him
that
his
soul
was
vexed
unto
death
Judges
And
told
her
all
his
heart
and
said
unto
her
There
hath
not
come
razor
upon
head
for
have
been
Nazirite
unto
God
from
mother
womb
shaven
then
strength
will
from
and
shall
become
weak
and
like
any
other
man
Judges
And
when
Delilah
saw
that
had
told
her
all
his
heart
she
sent
and
called
for
the
lords
the
Philistines
saying
Come
this
once
for
hath
told
all
his
heart
Then
the
lords
the
Philistines
came
unto
her
and
brought
the
money

hand
Judges
And
she
made
him
sleep
upon
her
knees
and
she
called
for
man
and
shaved
off
the
seven
locks
his
head
and
she
began
afflict
him
and
his
strength
went
from
him
Judges
And
she
said
The
Philistines
are
upon
thee
Samson
And
awoke
out
his
sleep
and
said
will
out
other
times
and
shake
myself
free
But
knew
not
that
Jehovah
was
departed
from
him
Judges
And
the
Philistines
laid
hold
him
and
put
out
his
eyes
and
they
brought
him
down
Gaza
and
bound
him
with
fetters
brass
and
did
grind
the
prison
house
Judges
Howbeit
the
hair
his
head
began
grow
again
after
was
shaven
Judges
And
the
lords
the
Philistines
gathered
them
together
offer
great
sacrifice
unto
Dagon
their
god
and
rejoice
for
they
said
Our
god
hath
delivered
Samson
our
enemy
into
our
hand
Judges
And
when
the
people
saw
him
they
praised
their
god
for
they
said
Our
god
hath
delivered
into
our
hand
our
enemy
and
the
destroyer
our
country
who
hath
slain
many
Judges
And
came
pass
when
their
hearts
were
merry
that
they
said
Call
for
Samson
that
may
make
sport
And
they
called
for
Samson
out
the
prison
house
and
made
sport
before
them
And
they
set
him
between
the
pillars
Judges
and
Samson
said
unto
the
lad
that
held
him
the
hand
Suffer
that
may
feel
the
pillars
whereupon
the
house
resteth
that
may
lean
upon
them
Judges
Now
the
house
was
full
men
and
women
and
all
the
lords
the

were
there
and
there
were
upon
the
roof
about
three
thousand
men
and
women
that
beheld
while
Samson
made

Judges
And
Samson
called
unto
Jehovah
and
said
Lord

pray
thee
and
strengthen
pray
thee
only
this
once
God
that

once
avenged
the
Philistines
for

And
Samson
took
hold
the
two
middle
pillars
upon
which
the
house
rested
and
leaned
upon
them
the
one
with
his
right
hand
and
the
other
with
his
left
Judges
And
Samson
said
Let
die
with
the
Philistines
And
bowed
himself
with
all
his
might
and
the
house
fell
upon
the
lords
and
upon
all
the
people
that
were
therein
the
dead
that
slew
his
death
were
more
than
they
that

Then
his

But

from
the
day
that

Judges
And

Judges
Behold

And
the
tribes
Israel
sent

through
all
the

Judges
Now
therefore
deliver
the
men
the
base
fellows
that
are

put
them
death
and
put
away
evil
from
Israel
But
Benjamin
would
not
hearken
the
voice
their
brethren
the
children
Israel
Judges
And
the
children
Benjamin
gathered
themselves
together
out
the

Judges
And
the

morning
and
encamped
against

And
the

came
forth
out

and
destroyed

the
men
Israel
encouraged
themselves
and
set
the
battle
again
array

place
where
they
set
themselves
array
the
first
day
Judges
And
the
children
Israel
went
and
wept
before
Jehovah
until
even
and
they
asked
Jehovah
saying
Shall

draw
nigh
battle
against
the
children

brother
And
Jehovah
said
against
him
Judges
And
the
children

the
second
day
Judges
And
Benjamin
went
forth
against

out

the
second
day
and
destroyed
down
the
ground
the
children

again
eighteen
thousand

Judges
Then
all
the

and
all
the

went
and
came
unto
Beth
and
wept
and
sat
there
before
Jehovah
and
fasted
that
day
until
even
and
they
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
before
Jehovah
Judges
And
the
children
Israel
asked
Jehovah
for
the
ark
the
covenant
God
was
there
those
days
Judges
and
Phinehas
the
son
Eleazar
the
son
Aaron
stood
before
those
days
saying
Shall

again
out
battle
against
the
children
Benjamin
brother
shall
cease
And
Jehovah
said
for
morrow

deliver
him
into

hand
Judges
And
Israel
set
liers
wait
against
Gibeah
round
about
Judges
And
the
children
Israel
went
against
the
children
Benjamin
the
third
day
and
set
themselves
array
against
Gibeah
other
times
Judges
And
the
children
Benjamin
went
out
against
the
people
and
were
drawn
away
from
the
city
and
they
began
smite
and
kill
the
people
other
times
the
highways
which
one
goeth
Beth
and
the
other
Gibeah
the
field
about
thirty
men
Israel
Judges
And
the
children
Benjamin
said
They
are
smitten
down
before
the
first
But
the
children
Israel
said
Let
flee
and
draw
them
away
from
the
city
unto
the
highways
Judges
And
all
the
men
Israel
rose
out
their
place
and
set
themselves
array
Baal
tamar
and
the
liers
wait
Israel
brake
forth
out
their
place
even
out
Maareh
geba
Judges
And
there
came
over
against
Gibeah
ten
thousand
chosen
men
out
all
Israel
and
the
battle
was
sore
but
they
knew
not
that
evil
was
close
upon
them
Judges
And
Jehovah
smote
Benjamin
before
Israel
and
the
children
Israel
destroyed
Benjamin
that
day
twenty
and
five
thousand
and
hundred
men
all
these
drew
the
sword
Judges
the
children
Benjamin
saw
that
they
were
smitten
for
the
men
Israel
gave
place
Benjamin
because
they
trusted
unto
the
liers
wait
whom
they
had
set
against
Gibeah
Judges
And
the
liers
wait
hasted
and
rushed
upon
Gibeah
and
the
liers
wait
drew
themselves
along
and
smote
all
the
city
with
the
edge
the
sword
Judges
Now
the
appointed
sign
between
the
men
Israel
and
the
liers
wait
was
that
they
should
make
great
cloud
smoke
rise
out
the
city
Judges
And
the
men
Israel
turned
the
battle
and
Benjamin
began
smite
and
kill
the
men
Israel
about
thirty
persons
for
they
said
Surely
they
are
smitten
down
before
the
first
battle
Judges
But
when
the
cloud
began
arise
out
the
city
pillar
smoke
the
Benjamites
looked
behind
them
and
behold
the
whole
the
city
went
smoke
heaven
Judges
And
the
men
Israel
turned
and
the
men
Benjamin
were
dismayed
for
they
saw
that
evil
was
come
upon
them
Judges
Therefore
they
turned
their
backs
before
the
men
Israel
unto
the
way
the
wilderness
but
the
battle
followed
hard
after
them
and
they
that
came
out
the
cities
destroyed
them
the
midst
thereof
Judges
They
inclosed
the
Benjamites
round
about
and
chased
them
and
trod
them
down
their
resting
place
far
over
against
Gibeah
toward
the
sunrising
Judges
And
there
fell
Benjamin
eighteen
thousand
men
all
these
were
men
valor
Judges
And
they
turned
and
fled
toward
the
wilderness
unto
the
rock
Rimmon
and
they
gleaned
them
the
highways
five
thousand
men
and
followed
hard
after
them
unto
Gidom
and
smote
them
two
thousand
men
Judges
that
all
who
fell
that
day
Benjamin
were
twenty
and
five
thousand
men
that
drew
the
sword
all
these
were
men
valor
Judges
But
six
hundred
men
turned
and
fled
toward
the
wilderness
unto
the
rock
Rimmon
and
abode
the
rock
Rimmon
four
months
Judges
And
the
men
Israel
turned
again
upon
the
children
Benjamin
and
smote
them
with
the
edge
the
sword
both
the
entire
city
and
the
cattle
and
all
that
they
found
moreover
all
the
cities
which
they
found
they
set
fire
Judges
Now
the
men
Israel
had
sworn
Mizpah
saying
There
shall
not
any
give
his
daughter
unto
Benjamin
wife
Judges
And
the
people
came
Beth
and
sat
there
till
even
before
God
and
lifted
their
voices
and
wept
sore
Judges
And
they
said
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
why
this
come
pass
Israel
that
there
should
day
one
tribe
lacking
Israel
Judges
And
came
pass
the
morrow
that
the
people
rose
early
and
built
there
altar
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
Judges
And
the
children
Israel
said
Who
there
among
all
the
tribes
Israel
that
came
not
the
assembly
unto
Jehovah
For
they
had
made
great
oath
concerning
him
that
came
not
unto
Jehovah
Mizpah
saying
shall
surely
put
death
Judges
And
the
children
Israel
repented
them
for
Benjamin
their
brother
and
said
There
one
tribe
cut
off
from
Israel
this
day
Judges
How
shall
for
wives
for
them
that

seeing
have
sworn
Jehovah
that
will
not
give
them
our
daughters
wives
Judges
And
they
said
What
one
there
the
tribes
Israel
that
came
not
unto
Jehovah
Mizpah
And
behold
there
came
none
the
camp
from

gilead
the
assembly
Judges
For
when
the
people
were
numbered
behold
there
were
none
the

Jabesh
gilead
there
Judges
And
the
congregation
sent
thither
twelve
thousand
men
the

saying
and

Judges
And
this
the
thing

And
they
found
among

And
the
whole
congregation
sent
and
spake
the
children
Benjamin
that
were
the
rock
Rimmon
and
proclaimed
peace
unto
them
Judges
And
Benjamin
returned
that
time
and
they
gave
them
the
women
whom
they
had
saved
alive
the
women
Jabesh
gilead
and
yet
they
sufficed
them
not
Judges
And
the
people
repented
them
for
Benjamin
because
that
Jehovah
had
made
breach
the
tribes
Israel
Judges
Then
the
elders
the
congregation
said

And

And

she
left

speaking
unto

Ruth
they

And

And

Moabitess
said
unto
Naomi
Let

glean

ears
grain
after
him
whose
sight

And
she
said
unto
her
daughter
Ruth
And
she
went
and
came
and
gleaned
the
field
after
the
reapers
and
her
hap
was
light
the
portion
the
field
belonging
unto
Boaz
who
was

Ruth
And
behold
Boaz
came
from
Bethlehem
and
said
unto
the
reapers

you
And
they
answered
him
Jehovah

thee
Ruth
Then
said
Boaz
unto
his
servant
that

reapers
Whose

And
the

Then
said
Boaz
unto

Ruth
Let

not
touch
thee
and
when
thou
art
athirst
unto
the
vessels
and
drink
that
which
the
young
men
have
drawn
Ruth
Then
she
fell

face
and
bowed
herself

ground
and
said
unto
him
Why

that
thou
shouldest

Ruth
And
Boaz
answered
and
said
unto

Ruth
Then
she
said
Let

for
that
thou
hast
comforted
and
for
that
thou
hast
spoken
kindly
unto
thy
handmaid
though
not

Ruth
And
meal
time
Boaz
said
unto
her
Come
hither
and
eat
the
bread
and
dip
thy
morsel

vinegar
And
she
sat
beside
the
reapers
and
they
reached
her
parched
grain
and
she
did
eat
and
was
sufficed
and
left

And
when

commanded
his
young
men
saying
Let

And

Ruth
And
she

had
gleaned
and
she
brought

Ruth
And

And

And
Naomi
said
unto
her

And
Naomi
said
unto
her
The

Ruth
And
Ruth
the
Moabitess
said
Yea
said
unto

Ruth
And
Naomi
said
unto

And

And

Behold

Wash

And

And
she
went

and
did
according

And

And

And
she
answered
Ruth
thy

for

Ruth
And
said
Blessed
thou
Jehovah
daughter
thou
hast
showed
more
kindness

And

Ruth
And

and
she
rose

For
said
Let

that
the
woman

Ruth
And
said

thee
and

and
she
held
and
measured

and
laid

Ruth
And
when
she
came

mother
law
she
said
Who

And
she
told

And
she
said
These

Then

Ruth
Now

and
behold

And

Now
there
was
certain
man
Ramathaim
zophim
the
hill
country
Ephraim
and
his
name
was
Elkanah
the
son
Jeroham
the

Elihu
the

Tohu
the

Zuph
Ephraimite
Samuel
and
had
two
wives
the
name
the
one
was
Hannah
and
the
name
the
other
Peninnah
and
Peninnah
had
children
but
Hannah
had
children
Samuel
And
this
man
went
out
his
city
from
year
year
worship
and
sacrifice
unto
Jehovah
hosts
Shiloh
And
the
two
sons
Eli
Hophni
and
Phinehas
priests
unto
Jehovah
were
there
Samuel
And
when
the
day
came
that
Elkanah
sacrificed
gave
Peninnah
his
wife
and
all
her
sons
and
her
daughters
portions
Samuel
but
unto
Hannah
gave
double
portion
for
loved
Hannah
but
Jehovah
had
shut
her
womb
Samuel
And
her
rival
provoked
her
sore
make
her
fret
because
Jehovah
had
shut
her
womb
Samuel
And
did
year
year
when
she
went
the
house
Jehovah
she
provoked
her
therefore
she
wept
and
did
not
eat
Samuel
And
Elkanah
her
husband
said
unto
her
Hannah
why
weepest
thou
and
why
eatest
thou
not
and
why
thy
heart
grieved
not
better
thee
than
ten
sons
Samuel
Hannah
rose
after
they
had
eaten
Shiloh
and
after
they
had
drunk
Now
Eli
the
priest
was
sitting
upon
his
seat
the
door
post
the
temple
Jehovah
Samuel
And
she
was
bitterness
soul
and
prayed
unto
Jehovah
and
wept
sore
Samuel
And
she
vowed
vow
and
said
Jehovah
hosts
thou
wilt
indeed
look
the
affliction
thy
handmaid
and
remember
and
not
forget
thy
handmaid
but
wilt
give
unto
thy
handmaid
man
child
then
will
give
him
unto
Jehovah
all
the
days
his
life
and
there
shall
razor
come
upon
his
head
Samuel
And
came
pass
she
continued
praying
before
Jehovah
that
Eli
marked
her
mouth
Samuel
Now
Hannah
she
spake
her
heart
only
her
lips
moved
but
her
voice
was
not
heard
therefore
Eli
thought
she
had
been
drunken
Samuel
And
Eli
said
unto
her
How
long
wilt
thou
drunken
put
away
thy
wine
from
thee
Samuel
And
Hannah
answered
and
said
lord
woman
sorrowful
spirit
have
drunk
neither
wine
nor
strong
drink
but
poured
out
soul
before
Jehovah
Samuel
Count
not
thy
handmaid
for
wicked
woman
for
out
the
abundance
complaint
and
provocation
have
spoken
hitherto
Samuel
Then
Eli
answered
and
said
peace
and
the
God
Israel
grant
thy
petition
that
thou
hast
asked
him
Samuel
And
she
said
Let
thy
handmaid
find
favor
thy
sight
the
woman
went
her
way
and
did
eat
and
her
countenance
was
more
sad
Samuel
And
they
rose
the
morning
early
and
worshipped
before
Jehovah
and
returned
and
came
their
house
Ramah
and
Elkanah
knew
Hannah
his
wife
and
Jehovah
remembered
her
Samuel
and
came
pass
when
the
time
was
come
about
that
Hannah
conceived
and
bare
son
and
she
called
his
name
Samuel
saying
Because
have
asked
him
Jehovah
Samuel
And
the
man
Elkanah
and
all
his
house
went
offer
unto
Jehovah
the
yearly
sacrifice
and
his
vow
Samuel
But
Hannah
went
not
for
she
said
unto
her
husband
will
not
until
the
child
weaned
and
then
will
bring
him
that
may
appear
before
Jehovah
and
there
abide
for
ever
Samuel
And
Elkanah
her
husband
said
unto
her
what
seemeth
thee
good
tarry
until
thou
have
weaned
him
only
Jehovah
establish
his
word
the
woman
tarried
and
gave
her
son
suck
until
she
weaned
him
Samuel
And
when
she
had
weaned
him
she
took
him
with
her
with
three
bullocks
and
one
ephah
meal
and
bottle
wine
and
brought
him
unto
the
house
Jehovah
Shiloh
and
the
child
was
young
Samuel
And
they
slew
the
bullock
and
brought
the
child
Eli
Samuel
And
she
said
lord
thy
soul
liveth
lord
the
woman
that
stood
thee
here
praying
unto
Jehovah
Samuel
For
this
child
prayed
and
Jehovah
hath
given
petition
which
asked
him
Samuel
therefore
also
have
granted
him
Jehovah
long
liveth
granted
Jehovah
And
worshipped
Jehovah
there
Samuel
And
Hannah
prayed
and
said
heart
exulteth
Jehovah
horn
exalted
Jehovah
mouth
enlarged
over
mine
enemies
Because
rejoice
thy
salvation
Samuel
There
none
holy
Jehovah
For
there
none
besides
thee
Neither
there
any
rock
like
our
God
Samuel
Talk
more
exceeding
proudly
Let
not
arrogancy
come
out
your
mouth
For
Jehovah
God
knowledge
And
him
actions
are
weighed
Samuel
The
bows
the
mighty
men
are
broken
And
they
that
stumbled
are
girded
with
strength
Samuel
They
that
were
full
have
hired
out
themselves
for
bread
And
they
that
were
hungry
have
ceased
hunger
Yea
the
barren
hath
borne
seven
And
she
that
hath
many
children
languisheth
Samuel
Jehovah
killeth
and
maketh
alive
bringeth
down
Sheol
and
bringeth
Samuel
Jehovah
maketh
poor
and
maketh
rich
bringeth
low
also
lifteth
Samuel
raiseth
the
poor
out
the
dust
lifteth
the
needy
from
the
dunghill
make
them
sit
with
princes
And
inherit
the
throne
glory
For
the
pillars
the
earth
are
Jehovah
And
hath
set
the
world
upon
them
Samuel
will
keep
the
feet
his
holy
ones
But
the
wicked
shall
put
silence
darkness
For
strength
shall
man
prevail
Samuel
They
that
strive
with
Jehovah
shall
broken
pieces
Against
them
will
thunder
heaven
Jehovah
will
judge
the
ends
the
earth
And
will
give
strength
unto
his
king
And
exalt
the
horn
his
anointed
Samuel
And
Elkanah
went
Ramah
his
house
And
the
child
did
minister
unto
Jehovah
before
Eli
the
priest
Samuel
Now
the
sons
Eli
were
base
men
they
knew
not
Jehovah
Samuel
And
the
custom
the
priests
with
the
people
was
that
when
any
man
offered
sacrifice
the
priest
servant
came
while
the
flesh
was
boiling
with
flesh
hook
three
teeth
his
hand
Samuel
and
struck
into
the
pan
kettle
caldron
pot
all
that
the
flesh
hook
brought
the
priest
took
therewith
they
did
Shiloh
unto
all
the
Israelites
that
came
thither
Samuel
Yea
before
they
burnt
the
fat
the
priest
servant
came
and
said
the
man
that
sacrificed
Give
flesh
roast
for
the
priest
for
will
not
have
boiled
flesh
thee
but
raw
Samuel
And
the
man
said
unto
him
They
will
surely
burn
the
fat
first
and
then
take
much
thy
soul
desireth
then
would
say
Nay
but
thou
shalt
give
now
and
not
will
take
force
Samuel
And
the
sin
the
young
men
was
very
great
before
Jehovah
for
the
men
despised
the
offering
Jehovah
Samuel
But
Samuel
ministered
before
Jehovah
being
child
girded
with
linen
ephod
Samuel
Moreover
his
mother
made
him
little
robe
and
brought
him
from
year
year
when
she
came
with
her
husband
offer
the
yearly
sacrifice
Samuel
And
Eli
blessed
Elkanah
and
his
wife
and
said
Jehovah
give
thee
seed
this
woman
for
the
petition
which
was
asked
Jehovah
And
they
went
unto
their
own
home
Samuel
And
Jehovah
visited
Hannah
and
she
conceived
and
bare
three
sons
and
two
daughters
And
the
child
Samuel
grew
before
Jehovah
Samuel
Now
Eli
was
very
old
and
heard
all
that
his
sons
did
unto
all
Israel
and
how
that
they
lay
with
the
women
that
did
service
the
door
the
tent
meeting
Samuel
And
said
unto
them
Why
such
things
for
hear
your
evil
dealings
from
all
this
people
Samuel
Nay
sons
for
good
report
that
hear
make
Jehovah
people
transgress
Samuel
one
man
sin
against
another
God
shall
judge
him
but
man
sin
against
Jehovah
who
shall
entreat
for
him
Notwithstanding
they
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
their
father
because
Jehovah
was
minded
slay
them
Samuel
And
the
child
Samuel
grew
and
increased
favor
both
with
Jehovah
and
also
with
men
Samuel
And
there
came
man
God
unto
Eli
and
said
unto
him
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Did
reveal
myself
unto
the
house
thy
father
when
they
were
Egypt
bondage
Pharaoh
house
Samuel
and
did
choose
him
out
all
the
tribes
Israel
priest
unto
mine
altar
burn
incense
wear
ephod
before
and
did
give
unto
the
house
thy
father
all
the
offerings
the
children
Israel
made
fire
Samuel
Wherefore
kick
sacrifice
and
mine
offering
which
have
commanded
habitation
and
honorest
thy
sons
above
make
yourselves
fat
with
the
chiefest
all
the
offerings
Israel
people
Samuel
Therefore
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
saith
said
indeed
that
thy
house
and
the
house
thy
father
should
walk
before
for
ever
but
now
Jehovah
saith
far
from
for
them
that
honor
will
honor
and
they
that
despise
shall
lightly
esteemed
Samuel
Behold
the
days
come
that
will
cut
off
thine
arm
and
the
arm
thy
father
house
that
there
shall
not
old
man
thy
house
Samuel
And
thou
shalt
behold
the
affliction
habitation
all
the
wealth
which
God
shall
give
Israel
and
there
shall
not
old
man
thy
house
for
ever
Samuel
And
the
man
thine
whom
shall
not
cut
off
from
mine
altar
shall
consume
thine
eyes
and
grieve
thy
heart
and
all
the
increase
thy
house
shall
die
the
flower
their
age
Samuel
And
this
shall
the
sign
unto
thee
that
shall
come
upon
thy
two
sons
Hophni
and
Phinehas
one
day
they
shall
die
both
them
Samuel
And
will
raise
faithful
priest
that
shall
according
that
which
heart
and
mind
and
will
build
him
sure
house
and
shall
walk
before
mine
anointed
for
ever
Samuel
And
shall
come
pass
that
every
one
that
left
thy
house
shall
come
and
bow
down
him
for
piece
silver
and
loaf
bread
and
shall
say
Put
pray
thee
into
one
the
priests
offices
that
may
eat
morsel
bread
Samuel
And
the
child
Samuel
ministered
unto
Jehovah
before
Eli
And
the
word
Jehovah
was
precious
those
days
there
was
frequent
vision
Samuel
And
came
pass
that
time
when
Eli
was
laid
down
his
place
now
his
eyes
had
begun
wax
dim
that
could
not
see
Samuel
and
the
lamp
God
was
not
yet
gone
out
and
Samuel
was
laid
down
sleep
the
temple
Jehovah
where
the
ark
God
was
Samuel
that
Jehovah
called
Samuel
and
said
Here
Samuel
And
ran
unto
Eli
and
said
Here
for
thou
calledst
And
said
called
not
lie
down
again
And
went
and
lay
down
Samuel
And
Jehovah
called
yet
again
Samuel
And
Samuel
arose
and
went
Eli
and
said
Here
for
thou
calledst
And
answered
called
not
son
lie
down
again
Samuel
Now
Samuel
did
not
yet
know
Jehovah
neither
was
the
word
Jehovah
yet
revealed
unto
him
Samuel
And
Jehovah
called
Samuel
again
the
third
time
And
arose
and
went
Eli
and
said
Here
for
thou
calledst
And
Eli
perceived
that
Jehovah
had
called
the
child
Samuel
Therefore
Eli
said
unto
Samuel
lie
down
and
shall
call
thee
that
thou
shalt
say
Speak
Jehovah
for
thy
servant
heareth
Samuel
went
and
lay
down
his
place
Samuel
And
Jehovah
came
and
stood
and
called
other
times
Samuel
Samuel
Then
Samuel
said
Speak
for
thy
servant
heareth
Samuel
And
Jehovah
said
Samuel
Behold
will
thing
Israel
which
both
the
ears
every
one
that
heareth
shall
tingle
Samuel
that
day
will
perform
against
Eli
all
that
have
spoken
concerning
his
house
from
the
beginning
even
unto
the
end
Samuel
For
have
told
him
that
will
judge
his
house
for
ever
for
the
iniquity
which
knew
because
his
sons
did
bring
curse
upon
themselves
and
restrained
them
not
Samuel
And
therefore
have
sworn
unto
the
house
Eli
that
the
iniquity
Eli
house
shall
not
expiated
with
sacrifice
nor
offering
for
ever
Samuel
And
Samuel
lay
until
the
morning
and
opened
the
doors
the
house
Jehovah
And
Samuel
feared
show
Eli
the
vision
Samuel
Then
Eli
called
Samuel
and
said
Samuel
son
And
said
Here
Samuel
And
said
What
the
thing
that
Jehovah
hath
spoken
unto
thee
pray
thee
hide
not
from
God
thee
and
more
also
thou
hide
anything
from
all
the
things
that
spake
unto
thee
Samuel
And
Samuel
told
him
every
whit
and
hid
nothing
from
him
And
said
Jehovah
let
him
what
seemeth
him
good
Samuel
And
Samuel
grew
and
Jehovah
was
with
him
and
did
let
none
his
words
fall
the
ground
Samuel
And
all
Israel
from
Dan
even
Beer
sheba
knew
that
Samuel
was
established
prophet
Jehovah
Samuel
And
Jehovah
appeared
again
Shiloh
for
Jehovah
revealed
himself
Samuel
Shiloh
the
word
Jehovah
Samuel
And
the
word
Samuel
came
all
Israel
Now
Israel
went
out
against
the
Philistines
battle
and
encamped
beside
Eben
ezer
and
the
Philistines
encamped
Aphek
Samuel
And
the
Philistines
put
themselves
array
against
Israel
and
when
they
joined
battle
Israel
was
smitten
before
the
Philistines
and
they
slew
the
army
the
field
about
four
thousand
men
Samuel
And
when
the
people
were
come
into
the
camp
the
elders
Israel
said
Wherefore
hath
Jehovah
smitten
day
before
the
Philistines
Let
fetch
the
ark
the
covenant
Jehovah
out
Shiloh
unto
that
may
come
among
and
save
out
the
hand
our
enemies
Samuel
the
people
sent
Shiloh
and
they
brought
from
thence
the
ark
the
covenant
Jehovah
hosts
who
sitteth
above
the
cherubim
and
the
two
sons
Eli
Hophni
and
Phinehas
were
there
with
the
ark
the
covenant
God
Samuel
And
when
the
ark
the
covenant
Jehovah
came
into
the
camp
all
Israel
shouted
with
great
shout
that
the
earth
rang
again
Samuel
And
when
the
Philistines
heard
the
noise
the
shout
they
said
What
meaneth
the
noise
this
great
shout
the
camp
the
Hebrews
And
they
understood
that
the
ark
Jehovah
was
come
into
the
camp
Samuel
And
the
Philistines
were
afraid
for
they
said
God
come
into
the
camp
And
they
said
Woe
unto
for
there
hath
not
been
such
thing
heretofore
Samuel
Woe
unto
who
shall
deliver
out
the
hand
these
mighty
gods
these
are
the
gods
that
smote
the
Egyptians
with
all
manner
plagues
the
wilderness
Samuel
strong
and
quit
yourselves
like
men
Philistines
that
not
servants
unto
the
Hebrews
they
have
been
you
quit
yourselves
like
men
and
fight
Samuel
And
the
Philistines
fought
and
Israel
was
smitten
and
they
fled
every
man
his
tent
and
there
was
very
great
slaughter
for
there
fell
Israel
thirty
thousand
footmen
Samuel
And
the
ark
God
was
taken
and
the
two
sons
Eli
Hophni
and
Phinehas
were
slain
Samuel
And
there
ran
man
Benjamin
out
the
army
and
came
Shiloh
the
same
day
with
his
clothes
rent
and
with
earth
upon
his
head
Samuel
And
when
came
Eli
was
sitting
upon
his
seat
the
wayside
watching
for
his
heart
trembled
for
the
ark
God
And
when
the
man
came
into
the
city
and
told
all
the
city
cried
out
Samuel
And
when
Eli
heard
the
noise
the
crying
said
What
meaneth
the
noise
this
tumult
And
the
man
hasted
and
came
and
told
Eli
Samuel
Now
Eli
was
ninety
and
eight
years
old
and
his
eyes
were
set
that
could
not
see
Samuel
And
the
man
said
unto
Eli
that
came
out
the
army
and
fled
day
out
the
army
And
said
How
went
the
matter
son
Samuel
And
that
brought
the
tidings
answered
and
said
Israel
fled
before
the
Philistines
and
there
hath
been
also
great
slaughter
among
the
people
and
thy
two
sons
also
Hophni
and
Phinehas
are
dead
and
the
ark
God
taken
Samuel
And
came
pass
when
made
mention
the
ark
God
that
Eli
fell
from
off
his
seat
backward
the
side
the
gate
and
his
neck
brake
and
died
for
was
old
man
and
heavy
And
had
judged
Israel
forty
years
Samuel
And
his
daughter
law
Phinehas
wife
was
with
child
near
delivered
and
when
she
heard
the
tidings
that
the
ark
God
was
taken
and
that
her
father
law
and
her
husband
were
dead
she
bowed
herself
and
brought
forth
for
her
pains
came
upon
her
Samuel
And
about
the
time
her
death
the
women
that
stood
her
said
unto
her
Fear
not
for
thou
hast
brought
forth
son
But
she
answered
not
neither
did
she
regard
Samuel
And
she
named
the
child
Ichabod
saying
The
glory
departed
from
Israel
because
the
ark
God
was
taken
and
because
her
father
law
and
her
husband
Samuel
And
she
said
The
glory
departed
from
Israel
for
the
ark
God
taken
Samuel
Now
the
Philistines
had
taken
the
ark
God
and
they
brought
from
Eben
ezer
unto
Ashdod
Samuel
And
the
Philistines
took
the
ark
God
and
brought
into
the
house
Dagon
and
set
Dagon
Samuel
And
when
they
Ashdod
arose
early
the
morrow
behold
Dagon
was
fallen
upon
his
face
the
ground
before
the
ark
Jehovah
And
they
took
Dagon
and
set
him
his
place
again
Samuel
And
when
they
arose
early
the
morrow
morning
behold
Dagon
was
fallen
upon
his
face
the
ground
before
the
ark
Jehovah
and
the
head
Dagon
and
both
the
palms
his
hands
lay
cut
off
upon
the
threshold
only
the
stump
Dagon
was
left
him
Samuel
Therefore
neither
the
priests
Dagon
nor
any
that
come
into
Dagon
house
tread
the
threshold
Dagon
Ashdod
unto
this
day
Samuel
But
the
hand
Jehovah
was
heavy
upon
them
Ashdod
and
destroyed
them
and
smote
them
with
tumors
even
Ashdod
and
the
borders
thereof
Samuel
And
when
the
men
Ashdod
saw
that
was
they
said
The
ark
the
God
Israel
shall
not
abide
with
for
his
hand
sore
upon
and
upon
Dagon
our
god
Samuel
They
sent
therefore
and
gathered
all
the
lords
the
Philistines
unto
them
and
said
What
shall
with
the
ark
the
God
Israel
And
they
answered
Let
the
ark
the
God
Israel
carried
about
unto
Gath
And
they
carried
the
ark
the
God
Israel
thither
Samuel
And
was
that
after
they
had
carried
about
the
hand
Jehovah
was
against
the
city
with
very
great
discomfiture
and
smote
the
men
the
city
both
small
and
great
and
tumors
brake
out
upon
them
Samuel
they
sent
the
ark
God
Ekron
And
came
pass
the
ark
God
came
Ekron
that
the
Ekronites
cried
out
saying
They
have
brought
about
the
ark
the
God
Israel
slay
and
our
people
Samuel
They
sent
therefore
and
gathered
together
all
the
lords
the
Philistines
and
they
said
Send
away
the
ark
the
God
Israel
and
let
again
its
own
place
that
slay
not
and
our
people
For
there
was
deadly
discomfiture
throughout
all
the
city
the
hand
God
was
very
heavy
there
Samuel
And
the
men
that
died
not
were
smitten
with
the
tumors
and
the
cry
the
city
went
heaven
Samuel
And
the
ark
Jehovah
was
the
country
the
Philistines
seven
months
Samuel
And
the
Philistines
called
for
the
priests
and
the
diviners
saying
What
shall
with
the
ark
Jehovah
show
wherewith
shall
sent
its
place
Samuel
And
they
said
send
away
the
ark
the
God
Israel
send
not
empty
but
all
means
return
him
trespass
offering
then
shall
healed
and
shall
known
you
why
his
hand
not
removed
from
you
Samuel
Then
said
they
What
shall
the
trespass
offering
which
shall
return
him
And
they
said
Five
golden
tumors
and
five
golden
mice
according
the
number
the
lords
the
Philistines
for
one
plague
was
you
all
and
your
lords
Samuel
Wherefore
shall
make
images
your
tumors
and
images
your
mice
that
mar
the
land
and
shall
give
glory
unto
the
God
Israel
peradventure
will
lighten
his
hand
from
off
you
and
from
off
your
gods
and
from
off
your
land
Samuel
Wherefore
then
harden
your
hearts
the
Egyptians
and
Pharaoh
hardened
their
hearts
When
had
wrought
wonderfully
among
them
did
they
not
let
the
people
and
they
departed
Samuel
Now
therefore
take
and
prepare
you
new
cart
and
two
milch
kine
which
there
hath
come
yoke
and
tie
the
kine
the
cart
and
bring
their
calves
home
from
them
Samuel
and
take
the
ark
Jehovah
and
lay
upon
the
cart
and
put
the
jewels
gold
which
return
him
for
trespass
offering
coffer
the
side
thereof
and
send
away
that
may
Samuel
And
see
goeth
the
way
its
own
border
Beth
shemesh
then
hath
done
this
great
evil
but
not
then
shall
know
that
not
his
hand
that
smote
was
chance
that
happened
Samuel
And
the
men
did
and
took
two
milch
kine
and
tied
them
the
cart
and
shut
their
calves
home
Samuel
and
they
put
the
ark
Jehovah
upon
the
cart
and
the
coffer
with
the
mice
gold
and
the
images
their
tumors
Samuel
And
the
kine
took
the
straight
way
the
way
Beth
shemesh
they
went
along
the
highway
lowing
they
went
and
turned
not
aside
the
right
hand
the
left
and
the
lords
the
Philistines
went
after
them
unto
the
border
Beth
shemesh
Samuel
And
they
Beth
shemesh
were
reaping
their
wheat
harvest
the
valley
and
they
lifted
their
eyes
and
saw
the
ark
and
rejoiced
see
Samuel
And
the
cart
came
into
the
field
Joshua
the
Beth
shemite
and
stood
there
where
there
was
great
stone
and
they
clave
the
wood
the
cart
and
offered
the
kine
for
burnt
offering
unto
Jehovah
Samuel
And
the
Levites
took
down
the
ark

said
Samuel
Cease
not

our
God
for

And
Samuel
took

lamb
and
offered

and

cried
unto

And
the

were
restored

from

even
unto

and
the

thereof
did
Israel
deliver

And
there
was
peace
between
Israel
and
the
Amorites
Samuel
And
Samuel
judged
Israel
all
the
days
his
life
Samuel
And
went
from

and
Gilgal
and
Mizpah
and
judged

And
his
return
was

for
there
was
his
house
and
there

and
built
there

And
came

when

that

Now

Samuel
And
his
sons
walked
not
his
ways
but
turned
aside
after
lucre
and
took
bribes
and
perverted
justice
Samuel
Then
all
the
elders
Israel
gathered
themselves
together
and
came
Samuel
unto
Ramah
Samuel
and
they
said
unto
him
Behold
thou
art
old
and
thy
sons
walk
not
thy
ways
now
make

judge
like
all
the
nations
Samuel
But
the
thing
displeased
Samuel
when
they
said
Give

judge
And
Samuel
prayed
unto
Jehovah
Samuel
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Samuel
Hearken
unto
the
voice
the
people
all
that
they
say
unto
thee
for
they
have
not
rejected
thee
but
they
have
rejected
that
should
not

them
Samuel
According
all
the
works
which
they
have
done
since
the
day
that
brought
them
out
Egypt
even
unto
this
day
that
they
have
forsaken
and
served
other
gods
they
also
unto
thee
Samuel
Now
therefore
hearken
unto
their
voice
howbeit
thou
shalt
protest
solemnly
unto
them
and
shalt
show
them
the
manner
the
king
that
shall
reign
over
them
Samuel
And
Samuel
told
all
the
words
Jehovah
unto
the
people
that
asked
him
king
Samuel
And
said
This
will

reign
over
you
will
take
your
sons
and
appoint
them
unto
him
for
his
chariots
and
his
horsemen
and
they
shall
run
before
his
chariots
Samuel
and
will
appoint
them
unto
him
for
captains
thousands
and
captains
fifties
and
will
set
some
plow
his
ground
and
reap
his
harvest
and
make
his
instruments
war
and
the
instruments
his
chariots
Samuel
And
will
take
your
daughters
perfumers
and
cooks
and
bakers
Samuel
And
will
take
your
fields
and
your
vineyards
and
your
oliveyards
even
the
best
them
and
give
them
his
servants
Samuel
And
will
take
the
tenth
your
seed
and
your
vineyards
and
give
his
officers
and
his
servants
Samuel
And
will
take
your
men
servants
and
your
maid
servants
and
your
goodliest
young
men
and
your
asses
and
put
them

work
Samuel
will
take
the
tenth
your
flocks
and
shall
his
servants
Samuel
And
shall
cry
out
that
day
because
your
king
whom
shall
have
chosen
you
and
Jehovah
will
not
answer
you
that
day
Samuel
But
the
people
refused
hearken
unto
the
voice
Samuel
and
they
said
Nay
but
will
have
king
over
Samuel
that
also
may
like
all
the
nations
and
that
our
king
may
judge
and
out
before
and
fight
our
battles
Samuel
And
Samuel
heard
all
the
words
the
people
and
rehearsed
them

ears
Jehovah
Samuel
And
Jehovah
said
Samuel
Hearken

called
the

Samuel
and
said
unto
the
children
Israel
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
brought
Israel
out

and
delivered
you
out
the
hand
the
Egyptians
and
out
the
hand
all
the

that

but
have
this
day
rejected
your
God
who
himself
saveth
you
out
all
your
calamities
and
your
distresses
and
have
said
unto

Nay
but
set
king
over
Now
therefore
present
yourselves
before
Jehovah
your
tribes
and
your
thousands
Samuel
Samuel

was
taken
but
when
they
sought

Therefore
they
asked
Jehovah
further
there
yet
man

hither
And
Jehovah
answered
Behold

hid
himself
among
the
baggage
Samuel
And
they
ran
and
fetched
him
thence
and
when
stood
among
the
people
was
higher
than
any
the
people
from
his
shoulders
and
upward
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
all
the
people
See
him
whom
Jehovah
hath
chosen
that
there
none
like
him
along
all
the
people
And
all
the
people
shouted
and
said
Long
live
the
king
Samuel
Then
Samuel
told
the
people
the
manner
the
kingdom
and
wrote
book
and
laid
before
Jehovah
And
Samuel
sent
all
the
people
away
every
man

house
Samuel
And
Saul
also
went

house

and
there
went
with
him
the
host
whose
hearts
God
had
touched
Samuel
But
certain
worthless
fellows
said
How
shall
this
man
save
And
they
despised
him
and
brought
him
present
But
held
his
peace
Samuel
Then
Nahash
the
Ammonite
came
and
encamped
against
Jabesh
gilead
and
all
the
men
Jabesh
said
unto

Make
covenant
with
and
will
serve
thee
Samuel
And
Nahash
the
Ammonite
said
unto
them
this
condition
will
make
with
you
that
all
your
right
eyes
put
out
and
will
lay
for
reproach
upon
all
Israel
Samuel
And
the
elders
Jabesh
said
unto
him
Give
seven
days
respite
that
may
send
messengers
unto
all
the
borders
Israel
and
then
there
none
save
will
come
out
thee
Samuel
Then
came
the
messengers
Gibeah
Saul
and
spake
these
words
the
ears
the
people
and
all
the
people
lifted
their
voice
and
wept
Samuel
And
behold
Saul
came
following
the
oxen
out
the
field
and
Saul
said
What
aileth
the
people
that
they
weep
And
they
told
him
the
words
the
men
Jabesh
Samuel
And
the
Spirit
God
came
mightily
upon
Saul
when
heard
those
words
and
his
anger
was
kindled
greatly
Samuel
And
took
yoke
oxen
and
cut
them
pieces
and
sent
them
throughout
all
the
borders
Israel
the
hand
messengers
saying
Whosoever
cometh
not
forth
after
Saul
and
after
Samuel
shall
done
unto
his
oxen
And
the
dread
Jehovah
fell
the
people
and
they
came
out
one
man
Samuel
And
numbered
them
Bezek
and
the
children
Israel
were
three
hundred
thousand
and
the
men
Judah
thirty
thousand
Samuel
And
they
said
unto
the
messengers
that
came
Thus
shall
say
unto
the
men
Jabesh
gilead
morrow
the
time
the
sun
hot
shall
have
deliverance
And
the
messengers
came
and
told
the
men
Jabesh
and
they
were
glad
Samuel
Therefore
the
men
Jabesh
said
morrow
will
come
out
unto
you
and
shall
with
all
that
seemeth
good
unto
you
Samuel
And
was
the
morrow
that
Saul
put
the
people
three
companies
and
they
came
into
the
midst
the
camp
the
morning
watch
and
smote
the
Ammonites
until
the
heat
the
day
and
came
pass
that
they
that
remained
were
scattered
that
not
two
them
were
left
together
Samuel
And
the
people
said
unto
Samuel
Who
that
said
Shall
Saul
reign
over
bring
the
men
that
may
put
them
death
Samuel
And
Saul
said
There
shall
not
man
put
death
this
day
for
day
Jehovah
hath
wrought
deliverance
Israel
Samuel
Then
said
Samuel
the
people
Come
and
let
Gilgal
and
renew
the
kingdom
there
Samuel
And
all
the
people
went
Gilgal
and
there
they
made
Saul
king
before
Jehovah
Gilgal
and
there
they
offered
sacrifices
peace
offerings
before
Jehovah
and
there
Saul
and
all
the
men
Israel
rejoiced
greatly
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
unto
all
Israel
Behold
have
hearkened
unto
your
voice
all
that
said
unto
and
have
made
king
over
you
Samuel
And
now
behold
the
king
walketh
before
you
and
old
and
grayheaded
and
behold
sons
are
with
you
and
have
walked
before
you
from
youth
unto
this
day
Samuel
Here
witness
against
before
Jehovah
and
before
his
anointed
whose
have
taken
whose
ass
have
taken
whom
have
defrauded
whom
have
oppressed
whose
hand
have
taken
ransom
blind
mine
eyes
therewith
and
will
restore
you
Samuel
And
they
said
Thou
hast
not
defrauded
nor
oppressed
neither
hast
thou
taken
aught
any
man
hand
Samuel
And
said
unto
them
Jehovah
witness
against
you
and
his
anointed
witness
this
day
that
have
not
found
aught
hand
And
they
said
witness
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
unto
the
people
Jehovah
that
appointed
Moses
and
Aaron
and
that
brought
your
fathers
out
the
land
Egypt
Samuel
Now
therefore
stand
still
that
may
plead
with
you
before
Jehovah
concerning
all
the
righteous
acts
Jehovah
which
did
you
and
your
fathers
Samuel
When
Jacob
was
come
into
Egypt
and
your
fathers
cried
unto
Jehovah
then
Jehovah
sent
Moses
and
Aaron
who
brought
forth
your
fathers
out
Egypt
and
made
them
dwell
this
place
Samuel
But
they
forgat
Jehovah
their
God
and
sold
them
into
the
hand
Sisera
captain
the
host
Hazor
and
into
the
hand
the
Philistines
and
into
the
hand
the
king
Moab
and
they
fought
against
them
Samuel
And
they
cried
unto
Jehovah
and
said
have
sinned
because
have
forsaken
Jehovah
and
have
served
the
Baalim
and
the
Ashtaroth
but
now
deliver
out
the
hand
our
enemies
and
will
serve
thee
Samuel
And
Jehovah
sent
Jerubbaal
and
Bedan
and
Jephthah
and
Samuel
and
delivered
you
out
the
hand
your
enemies
every
side
and
dwelt
safety
Samuel
And
when
saw
that
Nahash
the
king
the
children
Ammon
came
against
you
said
unto
Nay
but
king
shall
reign
over
when
Jehovah
your
God
was
your
king
Samuel
Now
therefore
behold
the
king
whom
have
chosen
and
whom
have
asked
for
and
behold
Jehovah
hath
set
king
over
you
Samuel
will
fear
Jehovah
and
serve
him
and
hearken
unto
his
voice
and
not
rebel
against
the
commandment
Jehovah
and
both
and
also
the
king
that
reigneth
over
you
followers
Jehovah
your
God
well
Samuel
but
will
not
hearken
unto
the
voice
Jehovah
but
rebel
against
the
commandment
Jehovah
then
will
the
hand
Jehovah
against
you
was
against
your
fathers
Samuel
Now
therefore
stand
still
and
see
this
great
thing
which
Jehovah
will
before
your
eyes
Samuel
not
wheat
harvest
day
will
call
unto
Jehovah
that
may
send
thunder
and
rain
and
shall
know
and
see
that
your
wickedness
great
which
have
done
the
sight
Jehovah
asking
you
king
Samuel
Samuel
called
unto
Jehovah
and
Jehovah
sent
thunder
and
rain
that
day
and
all
the
people
greatly
feared
Jehovah
and
Samuel
Samuel
And
all
the
people
said
unto
Samuel
Pray
for
thy
servants
unto
Jehovah
thy
God
that
die
not
for
have
added
unto
all
our
sins
this
evil
ask
king
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
unto
the
people
Fear
not
have
indeed
done
all
this
evil
yet
turn
not
aside
from
following
Jehovah
but
serve
Jehovah
with
all
your
heart
Samuel
and
turn
not
aside
for
then
would
after
vain
things
which
cannot
profit
nor
deliver
for
they
are
vain
Samuel
For
Jehovah
will
not
forsake
his
people
for
his
great
name
sake
because
hath
pleased
Jehovah
make
you
people
unto
himself
Samuel
Moreover
for
far
from
that
should
sin
against
Jehovah
ceasing
pray
for
you
but
will
instruct
you
the
good
and
the
right
way
Samuel
Only
fear
Jehovah
and
serve
him
truth
with
all
your
heart
for
consider
how
great
things
hath
done
for
you
Samuel
But
shall
still
wickedly
shall
consumed
both
and
your
king
Samuel
Saul
was
forty
years
old
when
began
reign
and
when
had
reigned
two
years
over
Israel
Samuel
Saul
chose
him
three
thousand
men
Israel
whereof
two
thousand
were
with
Saul
Michmash
and
the
mount
Beth
and
thousand
were
with
Jonathan
Gibeah
Benjamin
and
the
rest
the
people
sent
every
man
his
tent
Samuel
And
Jonathan
smote
the
garrison
the
Philistines
that
was
Geba
and
the
Philistines
heard
And
Saul
blew
the
trumpet
throughout
all
the
land
saying
Let
the
Hebrews
hear
Samuel
And
all
Israel
heard
say
that
Saul
had
smitten
the
garrison
the
Philistines
and
also
that
Israel
was
had
abomination
with
the
Philistines
And
the
people
were
gathered
together
after
Saul
Gilgal
Samuel
And
the
Philistines
assembled
themselves
together
fight
with
Israel
thirty
thousand
chariots
and
six
thousand
horsemen
and
people
the
sand
which
the
sea
shore
multitude
and
they
came
and
encamped
Michmash
eastward
Beth
aven
Samuel
When
the
men
Israel
saw
that
they
were
strait
for
the
people
were
distressed
then
the
people
did
hide
themselves
caves
and
thickets
and
rocks
and
coverts
and
pits
Samuel
Now
some
the
Hebrews
had
gone
over
the
Jordan
the
land
Gad
and
Gilead
but
for
Saul
was
yet
Gilgal
and
all
the
people
followed
him
trembling
Samuel
And
tarried
seven
days
according
the
set
time
that
Samuel
had
appointed
but
Samuel
came
not
Gilgal
and
the
people
were
scattered
from
him
Samuel
And
Saul
said
Bring
hither
the
burnt
offering
and
the
peace
offerings
And
offered
the
burnt
offering
Samuel
And
came
pass
that
soon
had
made
end
offering
the
burnt
offering
behold
Samuel
came
and
Saul
went
out
meet
him
that
might
salute
him
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
What
hast
thou
done
And
Saul
said
Because
saw
that
the
people
were
scattered
from
and
that
thou
camest
not
within
the
days
appointed
and
that
the
Philistines
assembled
themselves
together
Michmash
Samuel
therefore
said
Now
will
the
Philistines
come
down
upon
Gilgal
and
have
not
entreated
the
favor
Jehovah
forced
myself
therefore
and
offered
the
burnt
offering
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
Saul
Thou
hast
done
foolishly
thou
hast
not
kept
the
commandment
Jehovah
thy
God
which
commanded
thee
for
now
would
Jehovah
have
established
thy
kingdom
upon
Israel
for
ever
Samuel
But
now
thy
kingdom
shall
not
continue
Jehovah
hath
sought
him
man
after
his
own
heart
and
Jehovah
hath
appointed
him
prince
over
his
people
because
thou
hast
not
kept
that
which
Jehovah
commanded
thee
Samuel
And
Samuel
arose
and
gat
him
from
Gilgal
unto
Gibeah
Benjamin
And
Saul
numbered
the
people
that
were
present
with
him
about
six
hundred
men

And
Saul
and
Jonathan
his
son
and
the
people
that
were
present
with
them

but
the
Philistines
encamped

And
the

Philistines
three
companies
one
company
turned
unto
the
way
that
leadeth
Ophrah
unto
the
land
Shual
Samuel
and
another
company
turned
the
way
Beth
horon
and
another
company
turned
the
way
the
border
that
looketh
down
upon
the
valley
Zeboim
toward
the
wilderness
Samuel
Now
there
was
smith
found
throughout
all
the
land
Israel
for
the
Philistines
said
Lest
the
Hebrews
make
them
swords
spears
Samuel
but
all
the
Israelites
went
down
the
Philistines
sharpen
every
man
his
share
and
his
coulter
and
his
axe
and
his
mattock
Samuel
yet
they
had
file
for
the
mattocks
and
for
the
coulters
and
for
the
forks
and
for
the
axes
and
set
the
goads
Samuel
came

the
day

that
there
was
neither

but
with

and
with
Jonathan
his
son
was
there
found
Samuel
And
the
garrison
the
Philistines
went
out
unto
the
pass
Michmash
Samuel
Now
fell
upon
day
that
Jonathan
the
son
Saul
said
unto
the
young
man
that
bare
his
armor
Come
and
let
over
the
Philistines
garrison
that
yonder
side
But
told
not
his
father
Samuel
And
Saul
abode
the
uttermost
part
Gibeah
under
the
pomegranate
tree
which
Migron
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
were
about
six
hundred

and
Ahijah
the
son
Ahitub
Ichabod
brother
the
son
Phinehas
the
son
Eli
the
priest
Jehovah
Shiloh
wearing
ephod
And
the
people
knew
not
that
Jonathan
was
gone
Samuel
And
between
the
passes
which
Jonathan
sought
over
unto
the
Philistines
garrison
there
was
rocky
crag
the
one
side
and
rocky
crag
the
other
side
and
the
name
the
one
was
Bozez
and
the
name
the
other
Seneh
Samuel
The
one
crag
rose

north
front

and
the
other
the
south
front
Geba
Samuel
And
Jonathan
said
the
young
man
that
bare
his
armor
Come
and
let
over
unto
the
garrison
these
uncircumcised
may
that
Jehovah
will
work
for
for
there
restraint
Jehovah
save
many
few
Samuel
And
his
armorbearer
said
unto
him
all
that
thy
heart
turn
thee
behold
with
thee
according
thy
heart
Samuel
Then
said
Jonathan
Behold
will
pass
over
unto
the
men
and
will
disclose
ourselves
unto
them
Samuel
they
say
thus
unto
Tarry
until
come
you
then
will
stand
still
our
place
and
will
not
unto
them
Samuel
But
they
say
thus
Come
unto
then
will
for
Jehovah
hath
delivered
them
into
our
hand
and
this
shall
the
sign
unto
Samuel
And
both
them
disclosed
themselves
unto
the
garrison
the
Philistines
and
the
Philistines
said
Behold
the
Hebrews
come
forth
out
the
holes
where
they
had
hid
themselves
Samuel
And
the
men
the
garrison
answered
Jonathan
and
his
armorbearer
and
said
Come
and
will
show
you
thing
And
Jonathan
said
unto
his
armorbearer
Come
after
for
Jehovah
hath
delivered
them
into
the
hand
Israel
Samuel
And
Jonathan
climbed
upon
his
hands
and
upon
his
feet
and
his
armorbearer
after
him
and
they
fell
before
Jonathan
and
his
armorbearer
slew
them
after
him
Samuel
And
that
first
slaughter
which
Jonathan
and
his
armorbearer
made
was
about
twenty
men
within
were
half
furrow
length
acre
land
Samuel
And
there
was
trembling
the
camp
the
field
and
among
all
the
people
the
garrison
and
the
spoilers
they
also
trembled
and
the
earth
quaked
there
was
exceeding
great
trembling
Samuel
And
the
watchmen
Saul
Gibeah
Benjamin
looked
and
behold
the
multitude
melted
away
and
they
went
hither
and
thither
Samuel
Then
said
Saul
unto
the
people
that
were
with
him
Number
now
and
see
who
gone
from
And
when
they
had
numbered
behold
Jonathan
and
his
armorbearer
were
not
there
Samuel
And
Saul
said
unto
Ahijah
Bring
hither
the
ark
God
For
the
ark
God
was
there
that
time
with
the
children
Israel
Samuel
And
came
pass
while
Saul
talked
unto
the
priest
that
the
tumult
that
was
the
camp
the
Philistines
went
and
increased
and
Saul
said
unto
the
priest
Withdraw
thy
hand
Samuel
And
Saul
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
were
gathered
together
and
came
the
battle
and
behold
every
man
sword
was
against
his
fellow
and
there
was
very
great
discomfiture
Samuel
Now
the
Hebrews
that
were
with
the
Philistines
beforetime
and
that
went
with
them
into
the
camp
from
the
country
round
about
even
they
also
turned
with
the
Israelites
that
were
with
Saul
and
Jonathan
Samuel
Likewise
all
the
men
Israel
that
had
hid
themselves
the
hill
country
Ephraim
when
they
heard
that
the
Philistines
fled
even
they
also
followed
hard
after
them
the
battle
Samuel
Jehovah
saved
Israel
that
day
and
the
battle
passed
over
Beth
aven
Samuel
And
the
men
Israel
were
distressed
that
day
for
Saul
had
adjured
the
people
saying
Cursed
the
man
that
eateth
any
food
until
evening
and
avenged
mine
enemies
none
the
people
tasted
food
Samuel
And
all
the
people
came
into
the
forest
and
there
was
honey
upon
the
ground
Samuel
And
when
the
people
were
come
unto
the
forest
behold
the
honey
dropped
but
man
put
his
hand
his
mouth
for
the
people
feared
the
oath
Samuel
But
Jonathan
heard
not
when
his
father
charged
the
people
with
the
oath
wherefore
put
forth
the
end
the
rod
that
was
his
hand
and
dipped
the
honeycomb
and
put
his
hand
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
were
enlightened
Samuel
Then
answered
one
the
people
and
said
Thy
father
straitly
charged
the
people
with
oath
saying
Cursed
the
man
that
eateth
food
this
day
And
the
people
were
faint
Samuel
Then
said
Jonathan
father
hath
troubled
the
land
see
pray
you
how
mine
eyes
have
been
enlightened
because
tasted
little
this
honey
Samuel
How
much
more
haply
the
people
had
eaten
freely
day
the
spoil
their
enemies
which
they
found
for
now
hath
there
been
great
slaughter
among
the
Philistines
Samuel
And
they
smote
the
Philistines
that
day
from
Michmash
Aijalon
And
the
people
were
very
faint
Samuel
and
the
people
flew
upon
the
spoil
and
took
sheep
and
oxen
and
calves
and
slew
them
the
ground
and
the
people
did
eat
them
with
the
blood
Samuel
Then
they
told
Saul
saying
Behold
the
people
sin
against
Jehovah
that
they
eat
with
the
blood
And
said
have
dealt
treacherously
roll
great
stone
unto
this
day
Samuel
And
Saul
said
Disperse
yourselves
among
the
people
and
say
unto
them
Bring
hither
every
man
his
and
every
man
his
sheep
and
slay
them
here
and
eat
and
sin
not
against
Jehovah
eating
with
the
blood
And
all
the
people
brought
every
man
his
with
him
that
night
and
slew
them
there
Samuel
And
Saul
built
altar
unto
Jehovah
the
same
was
the
first
altar
that
built
unto
Jehovah
Samuel
And
Saul
said
Let
down
after
the
Philistines
night
and
take
spoil
among
them
until
the
morning
light
and
let
not
leave
man
them
And
they
said
whatsoever
seemeth
good
unto
thee
Then
said
the
priest
Let
draw
near
hither
unto
God
Samuel
And
Saul
asked
counsel
God
Shall
down
after
the
Philistines
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
the
hand
Israel
But
answered
him
not
that
day
Samuel
And
Saul
said
Draw
nigh
hither
all
chiefs
the
people
and
know
and
see
wherein
this
sin
hath
been
this
day
Samuel
For
Jehovah
liveth
who
saveth
Israel
though
Jonathan
son
shall
surely
die
But
there
was
not
man
among
all
the
people
that
answered
him
Samuel
Then
said
unto
all
Israel
one
side
and
and
Jonathan
son
will
the
other
side
And
the
people
said
unto
Saul
what
seemeth
good
unto
thee
Samuel
Therefore
Saul
said
unto
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Show
the
right
And
Jonathan
and
Saul
were
taken
lot
but
the
people
escaped
Samuel
And
Saul
said
Cast
lots
between
and
Jonathan
son
And
Jonathan
was
taken
Samuel
Then
Saul
said
Jonathan
Tell
what
thou
hast
done
And
Jonathan
told
him
and
said
did
certainly
taste
little
honey
with
the
end
the
rod
that
was
hand
and
must
die
Samuel
And
Saul
said
God
and
more
also
for
thou
shalt
surely
die
Jonathan
Samuel
And
the
people
said
unto
Saul
Shall
Jonathan
die
who
hath
wrought
this
great
salvation
Israel
Far
from
Jehovah
liveth
there
shall
not
one
hair
his
head
fall
the
ground
for
hath
wrought
with
God
this
day
the
people
rescued
Jonathan
that
died
not
Samuel
Then
Saul
went
from
following
the
Philistines
and
the
Philistines
went
their
own
place
Samuel
Now
when
Saul
had
taken
the
kingdom
over
Israel
fought
against
all
his
enemies
every
side
against
Moab
and
against
the
children
Ammon
and
against
Edom
and
against
the
kings
Zobah
and
against
the
Philistines
and
whithersoever
turned
himself
put
them
the
worse
Samuel
And
did
valiantly
and
smote
the
Amalekites
and
delivered
Israel
out
the
hands
them
that
despoiled
them
Samuel
Now
the
sons
Saul
were
Jonathan
and
Ishvi
and
Malchishua
and
the
names
his
two
daughters
were
these
the
name
the
first
born
Merab
and
the
name
the
younger
Michal
Samuel
and
the
name
Saul
wife
was
Ahinoam
the
daughter
Ahimaaz
And
the
name
the
captain
his
host
was
Abner
the
son
Ner
Saul
uncle
Samuel
And
Kish
was
the
father
Saul
and
Ner
the
father
Abner
was
the
son
Abiel
Samuel
And
there
was
sore
war
against
the
Philistines
all
the
days
Saul
and
when
Saul
saw
any
mighty
man
any
valiant
man
took
him
unto
him
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
unto
Saul
Jehovah
sent
anoint
thee
king
over
his
people
over
Israel
now
therefore
hearken
thou
unto
the
voice
the
words
Jehovah
Samuel
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
have
marked
that
which
Amalek
did
Israel
how
set
himself
against
him
the
way
when
came
out
Egypt
Samuel
Now
and
smite
Amalek
and
utterly
destroy
all
that
they
have
and
spare
them
not
but
slay
both
man
and
woman
infant
and
suckling
and
sheep
camel
and
ass
Samuel
And
Saul
summoned
the
people
and
numbered
them
Telaim
two
hundred
thousand
footmen
and
ten
thousand
men
Judah
Samuel
And
Saul
came
the
city
Amalek
and
laid
wait
the
valley
Samuel
And
Saul
said
unto
the
Kenites
depart
get
you
down
from
among
the
Amalekites
lest
destroy
you
with
them
for
showed
kindness
all
the
children
Israel
when
they
came
out
Egypt
the
Kenites
departed
from
among
the
Amalekites
Samuel
And
Saul
smote
the
Amalekites
from
Havilah
thou
goest
Shur
that
before
Egypt
Samuel
And
took
Agag
the
king
the
Amalekites
alive
and
utterly
destroyed
all
the
people
with
the
edge
the
sword
Samuel
But
Saul
and
the
people
spared
Agag
and
the
best
the
sheep
and
the
oxen
and
the
fatlings
and
the
lambs
and
all
that
was
good
and
would
not
utterly
destroy
them
but
everything
that
was
vile
and
refuse
that
they
destroyed
utterly
Samuel
Then
came
the
word
Jehovah
unto
Samuel
saying
Samuel
repenteth
that
have
set
Saul
king
for
turned
back
from
following
and
hath
not
performed
commandments
And
Samuel
was
wroth
and
cried
unto
Jehovah
all
night
Samuel
And
Samuel
rose
early
meet
Saul
the
morning
and
was
told
Samuel
saying
Saul
came
Carmel
and
behold
set
him
monument
and
turned
and
passed
and
went
down
Gilgal
Samuel
And
Samuel
came
Saul
and
Saul
said
unto
him
Blessed
thou
Jehovah
have
performed
the
commandment
Jehovah
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
What
meaneth
then
this
bleating
the
sheep
mine
ears
and
the
lowing
the
oxen
which
hear
Samuel
And
Saul
said
They
have
brought
them
from
the
Amalekites
for
the
people
spared
the
best
the
sheep
and
the
oxen
sacrifice
unto
Jehovah
thy
God
and
the
rest
have
utterly
destroyed
Samuel
Then
Samuel
said
unto
Saul
Stay
and
will
tell
thee
what
Jehovah
hath
said
this
night
And
said
unto
him
Say
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
Though
thou
wast
little
thine
own
sight
wast
thou
not
made
the
head
the
tribes
Israel
And
Jehovah
anointed
thee
king
over
Israel
Samuel
and
Jehovah
sent
thee
journey
and
said
and
utterly
destroy
the
sinners
the
Amalekites
and
fight
against
them
until
they
consumed
Samuel
Wherefore
then
didst
thou
not
obey
the
voice
Jehovah
but
didst
fly
upon
the
spoil
and
didst
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
Samuel
And
Saul
said
unto
Samuel
Yea
have
obeyed
the
voice
Jehovah
and
have
gone
the
way
which
Jehovah
sent
and
have
brought
Agag
the
king
Amalek
and
have
utterly
destroyed
the
Amalekites
Samuel
But
the
people
took
the
spoil
sheep
and
oxen
the
chief
the
devoted
things
sacrifice
unto
Jehovah
thy
God
Gilgal
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
Hath
Jehovah
great
delight
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
obeying
the
voice
Jehovah
Behold
obey
better
than
sacrifice
and
hearken
than
the
fat
rams
Samuel
For
rebellion
the
sin
witchcraft
and
stubbornness
idolatry
and
teraphim
Because
thou
hast
rejected
the
word
Jehovah
hath
also
rejected
thee
from
being
king
Samuel
And
Saul
said
unto
Samuel
have
sinned
for
have
transgressed
the
commandment
Jehovah
and
thy
words
because
feared
the
people
and
obeyed
their
voice
Samuel
Now
therefore
pray
thee
pardon
sin
and
turn
again
with
that
may
worship
Jehovah
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
unto
Saul
will
not
return
with
thee
for
thou
hast
rejected
the
word
Jehovah
and
Jehovah
hath
rejected
thee
from
being
king
over
Israel
Samuel
And
Samuel
turned
about
away
Saul
laid
hold
upon
the
skirt
his
robe
and
rent
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
unto
him
Jehovah
hath
rent
the
kingdom
Israel
from
thee
this
day
and
hath
given
neighbor
thine
that
better
than
thou
Samuel
And
also
the
Strength
Israel
will
not
lie
nor
repent
for
not
man
that
should
repent
Samuel
Then
said
have
sinned
yet
honor
now
pray
thee
before
the
elders
people
and
before
Israel
and
turn
again
with
that
may
worship
Jehovah
thy
God
Samuel
Samuel
turned
again
after
Saul
and
Saul
worshipped
Jehovah
Samuel
Then
said
Samuel
Bring
hither
Agag
the
king
the
Amalekites
And
Agag
came
unto
him
cheerfully
And
Agag
said
Surely
the
bitterness
death
past
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
thy
sword
hath
made
women
childless
shall
thy
mother
childless
among
women
And
Samuel
hewed
Agag
pieces
before
Jehovah
Gilgal
Samuel
Then
Samuel
went
Ramah
and
Saul
went
his
house
Gibeah
Saul
Samuel
And
Samuel
came
more
see
Saul
until
the
day
his
death
for
Samuel
mourned
for
Saul
and
Jehovah
repented
that
had
made
Saul
king
over
Israel
Samuel
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Samuel
How
long
wilt
thou
mourn
for
Saul
seeing
have
rejected
him
from
being
king
over
Israel
fill
thy
horn
with
oil
and
will
send
thee
Jesse
the
Beth
lehemite
for
have
provided
king
among
his
sons
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
How
can
Saul
hear
will
kill
And
Jehovah
said
Take
heifer
with
thee
and
say
come
sacrifice
Jehovah
Samuel
And
call
Jesse
the
sacrifice
and
will
show
thee
what
thou
shalt
and
thou
shalt
anoint
unto
him
whom
name
unto
thee
Samuel
And
Samuel
did
that
which
Jehovah
spake
and
came
Beth
lehem
And
the
elders
the
city
came
meet
him
trembling
and
said
Comest
thou
peaceably
Samuel
And
said
Peaceably
come
sacrifice
unto
Jehovah
sanctify
yourselves
and
come
with
the
sacrifice
And
sanctified
Jesse
and
his
sons
and
called
them
the
sacrifice
Samuel
And
came
pass
when
they
were
come
that
looked
Eliab
and
said
Surely
Jehovah
anointed
before
him
Samuel
But
Jehovah
said
unto
Samuel
Look
not
his
countenance
the
height
his
stature
because
have
rejected
him
for
Jehovah
seeth
not
man
seeth
for
man
looketh
the
outward
appearance
but
Jehovah
looketh
the
heart
Samuel
Then
Jesse
called
Abinadab
and
made
him
pass
before
Samuel
And
said
Neither
hath
Jehovah
chosen
this
Samuel
Then
Jesse
made
Shammah
pass
And
said
Neither
hath
Jehovah
chosen
this
Samuel
And
Jesse
made
seven
his
sons
pass
before
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
unto
Jesse
Jehovah
hath
not
chosen
these
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
unto
Jesse
Are
here
all
thy
children
And
said
There
remaineth
yet
the
youngest
and
behold
keeping
the
sheep
And
Samuel
said
unto
Jesse
Send
and
fetch
him
for
will
not
sit
down
till
come
hither
Samuel
And
sent
and
brought
him
Now
was
ruddy
and
withal
beautiful
countenance
and
goodly
look
upon
And
Jehovah
said
Arise
anoint
him
for
this
Samuel
Then
Samuel
took
the
horn
oil
and
anointed
him
the
midst
his
brethren
and
the
Spirit
Jehovah
came
mightily
upon
David
from
that
day
forward
Samuel
rose
and
went
Ramah
Samuel
Now
the
Spirit
Jehovah
departed
from
Saul
and
evil
spirit
from
Jehovah
troubled
him
Samuel
And
Saul
servants
said
unto
him
Behold
now
evil
spirit
from
God
troubleth
thee
Samuel
Let
our
lord
now
command
thy
servants
that
are
before
thee
seek
out
man
who

harp
and
shall
come
pass
when
the
evil
spirit
from
God
upon
thee
that
shall
play
with
his
hand
and
thou
shalt
well
Samuel
And
Saul
said
unto
his
servants
Provide
now
man
that
can
play
well
and
bring
him
Samuel
Then
answered
one
the
young
men
and
said
Behold
have
seen
son
Jesse
the
Beth
lehemite
that
skilful
playing
and
mighty
man
valor
and
man
war
and
prudent
speech
and
comely
person
and
Jehovah
with
him
Samuel
Wherefore
Saul
sent
messengers
unto
Jesse
and
said
Send
David
thy
son
who
with
the
sheep
Samuel
And
Jesse
took
ass
laden
with
bread
and
bottle
wine
and
kid
and
sent
them
David
his
son
unto
Saul
Samuel
And
David
came
Saul
and
stood
before
him
and
loved
him
greatly
and
became
his
armorbearer
Samuel
And
Saul
sent
Jesse
saying
Let
David
pray
thee
stand
before
for
hath
found
favor
sight
Samuel
And
came
pass
when
the
evil
spirit
from
God
was
upon
Saul
that
David
took
the
harp
and
played
with
his
hand
Saul
was
refreshed
and
was
well
and
the
evil
spirit
departed
from
him
Samuel
Now
the
Philistines
gathered
together
their
armies
battle
and
they
were
gathered
together
Socoh
which
belongeth
Judah
and
encamped
between
Socoh
and
Azekah
Ephes
dammim
Samuel
And
Saul
and
the
men
Israel
were
gathered
together
and
encamped
the
vale
Elah
and
set
the
battle
array
against
the
Philistines
Samuel
And
the
Philistines
stood
the
mountain
the
one
side
and
Israel
stood
the
mountain
the
other
side
and
there
was
valley
between
them
Samuel
And
there
went
out
champion
out
the
camp
the
Philistines
named
Goliath
Gath
whose

was
six
cubits
and
span
Samuel
And

upon
his
head
and
was
clad
with

mail
and
the
weight

was
five
thousand
shekels

Samuel
And

Samuel
And

and
his

weighed
six
hundred
shekels

and
his

Samuel
And

and
cried
unto
the
armies
Israel
and
said
unto
them
Why

with
and

then
will
your
servants
but
prevail
against
him
and
kill
him
then
shall
our
servants
and
serve
Samuel
And
the
Philistine
said
defy
the
armies
Israel
this
day
give
man
that
may
fight
together
Samuel
And
when
Saul
and
all
Israel
heard
those
words
the
Philistine
they
were
dismayed
and
greatly
afraid
Samuel
Now
David
was
the
son
that
Ephrathite
Beth
lehem
judah
whose
name
was
Jesse
and
had
eight
sons
and
the

And
David
was
the

and
the

Samuel
Now
David
went

his
father
sheep
Beth
lehem
Samuel
And
the
Philistine
drew
near
morning
and
evening
and
presented
himself
forty
days
Samuel
And
Jesse
said
unto
David
his
son
Take

ephah
this
parched
grain
and
these
ten
loaves
and
carry
them

Samuel
and
bring
these
ten
cheeses
unto
the
captain
their
thousand
and
look
how
thy
brethren
fare
and
take
their
pledge
Samuel
Now
Saul
and
they
and
all
the
men
Israel
were

vale
Elah
fighting
with
the
Philistines
Samuel
And
David
rose
early

commanded
him
and
came

shouted
for
the
battle
Samuel
And
Israel
and
the
Philistines
put
the
battle
array
army

army
Samuel
And
David
left
his
baggage

hand
the
keeper
the
baggage
and
ran

army
and
came
and
saluted
his
brethren
Samuel
And
talked
with
them
behold
there
came
the
champion
the
Philistine
Gath
Goliath
name
out
the
ranks
the
Philistines
and
spake
according
the
same
words
and
David
heard
them
Samuel
And
all
the
men
Israel
when
they
saw
the
man
fled
from
him
and
were
sore
afraid
Samuel
And
the
men
Israel
said
Have
seen
this
man
that
come
surely
defy
Israel
come
and
shall
that
the
man
who
killeth
him
the
king
will
enrich
him
with
great
riches
and
will
give
him
his
daughter
and
make
his
father
house
free
Israel
Samuel
And
David
spake
the
men
that
stood
him
saying
What
shall
done
the
man
that
killeth
this
Philistine
and
taketh
away
the
reproach
from
Israel
for
who
this
uncircumcised
Philistine
that
should
defy
the
armies
the
living
God
Samuel
And
the
people
answered
him
after
this
manner
saying
shall
done
the
man
that
killeth
him
Samuel
And
Eliab
his
eldest
brother
heard
when
spake
unto
the
men
and
Eliab
anger
was
kindled
against
David
and
said
Why
art
thou
come
down
and
with
whom
hast
thou
left
those
few
sheep
the
wilderness
know
thy
pride
and
the
naughtiness
thy
heart
for
thou
art
come
down
that
thou
mightest
see
the
battle
Samuel
And
David
said
What
have
now
done
there
not
cause
Samuel
And
turned
away
from
him
toward
another
and
spake
after
the
same
manner
and
the
people
answered
him
again
after
the
former
manner
Samuel
And
when
the
words
were
heard
which
David
spake
they
rehearsed
them
before
Saul
and
sent
for
him
Samuel
And
David
said
Saul
Let
man
heart
fail
because
him
thy
servant
will
and
fight
with
this
Philistine
Samuel
And
Saul
said
David
Thou
art
not
able
against
this
Philistine
fight
with
him
for
thou
art
but
youth
and
man
war
from
his
youth
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
Saul
Thy
servant
was
keeping
his
father
sheep
and
when
there
came
lion
bear
and
took
lamb
out
the
flock
Samuel
went
out
after
him
and
smote
him
and
delivered
out
his
mouth
and
when
arose
against
caught
him
his
beard
and
smote
him
and
slew
him
Samuel
Thy
servant
smote
both
the
lion
and
the
bear
and
this
uncircumcised
Philistine
shall
one
them
seeing
hath
defied
the
armies
the
living
God
Samuel
And
David
said
Jehovah
that
delivered
out
the
paw
the
lion
and
out
the
paw
the
bear
will
deliver
out
the
hand
this
Philistine
And
Saul
said
unto
David
and
Jehovah
shall
with
thee
Samuel
And
Saul
clad
David
with
his
apparel
and
put
helmet
brass
upon
his
head
and
clad
him
with
coat
mail
Samuel
And
David
girded
his
sword
upon
his
apparel
and
assayed
for
had
not
proved
And
David
said
unto
Saul
cannot
with
these
for
have
not
proved
them
And
David
put
them
off
him
Samuel
And
took
his
staff
his
hand
and
chose
him
five
smooth
stones
out
the
brook
and
put
them
the
shepherd
bag
which
had
even
his
wallet
and
his
sling
was
his
hand
and
drew
near
the
Philistine
Samuel
And
the
Philistine
came
and
drew
near
unto
David
and
the
man
that
bare
the
shield
went
before
him
Samuel
And
when
the
Philistine
looked
about
and
saw
David
disdained
him
for
was
but
youth
and
ruddy
and
withal
fair
countenance
Samuel
And
the
Philistine
said
unto
David
dog
that
thou
comest
with
staves
And
the
Philistine
cursed
David
his
gods
Samuel
And
the
Philistine
said
David
Come
and
will
give
thy
flesh
unto
the
birds
the
heavens
and
the
beasts
the
field
Samuel
Then
said
David
the
Philistine
Thou
comest
with
sword
and
with
spear
and
with
javelin
but
come
thee
the
name
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
the
armies
Israel
whom
thou
hast
defied
Samuel
This
day
will
Jehovah
deliver
thee
into
hand
and
will
smite
thee
and
take
thy
head
from
off
thee
and
will
give
the
dead
bodies
the
host
the
Philistines
this
day
unto
the
birds
the
heavens
and
the
wild
beasts
the
earth
that
all
the
earth
may
know
that
there
God
Israel
Samuel
and
that
all
this
assembly
may
know
that
Jehovah
saveth
not
with
sword
and
spear
for
the
battle
Jehovah
and
will
give
you
into
our
hand
Samuel
And
came
pass
when
the
Philistine
arose
and
came
and
drew
nigh
meet
David
that
David
hastened
and
ran
toward
the
army
meet
the
Philistine
Samuel
And
David
put
his
hand
his
bag
and
took
thence
stone
and
slang
and
smote
the
Philistine
his
forehead
and
the
stone
sank
into
his
forehead
and
fell
upon
his
face
the
earth
Samuel
David
prevailed
over
the
Philistine
with
sling
and
with
stone
and
smote
the
Philistine
and
slew
him
but
there
was
sword
the
hand
David
Samuel
Then
David
ran
and
stood
over
the
Philistine
and
took
his
sword
and
drew
out
the
sheath
thereof
and
slew
him
and
cut
off
his
head
therewith
And
when
the
Philistines
saw
that
their
champion
was
dead
they
fled
Samuel
And
the
men
Israel
and
Judah
arose
and
shouted
and
pursued
the
Philistines
until
thou
comest
Gai
and
the
gates
Ekron
And
the
wounded
the
Philistines
fell
down
the
way
Shaaraim
even
unto
Gath
and
unto
Ekron
Samuel
And
the
children
Israel
returned
from
chasing
after
the
Philistines
and
they
plundered
their
camp
Samuel
And
David
took
the
head
the
Philistine
and
brought
Jerusalem
but
put
his
armor
his
tent
Samuel
And
when
Saul
saw
David
forth
against
the
Philistine
said
unto
Abner
the
captain
the
host
Abner
whose
son
this
youth
And
Abner
said
thy
soul
liveth
king
cannot
tell
Samuel
And
the
king
said
Inquire
thou
whose
son
the
stripling
Samuel
And
David
returned
from
the
slaughter
the
Philistine
Abner
took
him
and
brought
him
before
Saul
with
the
head
the
Philistine
his
hand
Samuel
And
Saul
said
him
Whose
son
art
thou
thou
young
man
And
David
answered
the
son
thy
servant
Jesse
the
Beth
lehemite
Samuel
And
came
pass
when
had
made
end
speaking
unto
Saul
that
the
soul
Jonathan
was
knit
with
the
soul
David
and
Jonathan
loved
him
his
own
soul
Samuel
And
Saul
took
him
that
day
and
would
let
him
more
home
his
father
house
Samuel
Then
Jonathan
and
David
made
covenant
because
loved
him
his
own
soul
Samuel
And
Jonathan
stripped
himself
the
robe
that
was
upon
him
and
gave
David
and
his
apparel
even
his
sword
and
his
bow
and
his
girdle
Samuel
And
David
went
out
whithersoever
Saul
sent
him
and
behaved
himself
wisely
and
Saul
set
him
over
the
men
war
and
was
good
the
sight
all
the
people
and
also
the
sight
Saul
servants
Samuel
And
came
pass
they
came
when
David
returned
from
the
slaughter
the
Philistine
that
the
women
came
out
all
the
cities
Israel
singing
and
dancing
meet
king
Saul
with
timbrels
with
joy
and
with
instruments
music
Samuel
And
the
women
sang
one
another
they
played
and
said
Saul
hath
slain
his
thousands
And
David
his
ten
thousands
Samuel
And
Saul
was
very
wroth
and
this
saying
displeased
him
and
said
They
have
ascribed
unto
David
ten
thousands
and
they
have
ascribed
but
thousands
and
what
can
have
more
but
the
kingdom
Samuel
And
Saul
eyed
David
from
that
day
and
forward
Samuel
And
came
pass
the
morrow
that
evil
spirit
from
God
came
mightily
upon
Saul
and
prophesied
the
midst
the
house
and
David
played
with
his
hand
did
day
day
And
Saul
had
his
spear
his
hand
Samuel
and
Saul
cast
the
spear
for
said
will
smite
David
even
the
wall
And
David
avoided
out
his
presence
twice
Samuel
And
Saul
was
afraid
David
because
Jehovah
was
with
him
and
was
departed
from
Saul
Samuel
Therefore
Saul
removed
him
from
him
and
made
him
his
captain
over
thousand
and
went
out
and
came
before
the
people
Samuel
And
David
behaved
himself
wisely
all
his
ways
and
Jehovah
was
with
him
Samuel
And
when
Saul
saw
that
behaved
himself
very
wisely
stood
awe
him
Samuel
But
all
Israel
and
Judah
loved
David
for
went
out
and
came
before
them
Samuel
And
Saul
said
David
Behold
elder
daughter
Merab
her
will
give
thee
wife
only
thou
valiant
for
and
fight
Jehovah
battles
For
Saul
said
Let
not
hand
upon
him
but
let
the
hand
the
Philistines
upon
him
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
Saul
Who
and
what
life
father
family
Israel
that
should
son
law
the
king
Samuel
But
came
pass
the
time
when
Merab
Saul
daughter
should
have
been
given
David
that
she
was
given
unto
Adriel
the
Meholathite
wife
Samuel
And
Michal
Saul
daughter
loved
David
and
they
told
Saul
and
the
thing
pleased
him
Samuel
And
Saul
said
will
give
him
her
that
she
may
snare
him
and
that
the
hand
the
Philistines
may
against
him
Wherefore
Saul
said
David
Thou
shalt
this
day
son
law
second
time
Samuel
And
Saul
commanded
his
servants
saying
Commune
with
David
secretly
and
say
Behold
the
king
hath
delight
thee
and
all
his
servants
love
thee
now
therefore
the
king
son
law
Samuel
And
Saul
servants
spake
those
words
the
ears
David
And
David
said
Seemeth
you
light
thing
the
king
son
law
seeing
that
poor
man
and
lightly
esteemed
Samuel
And
the
servants
Saul
told
him
saying
this
manner
spake
David
Samuel
And
Saul
said
Thus
shall
say
David
The
king
desireth
not
any
dowry
but
hundred
foreskins
the
Philistines
avenged
the
king
enemies
Now
Saul
thought
make
David
fall
the
hand
the
Philistines
Samuel
And
when
his
servants
told
David
these
words
pleased
David
well
the
king
son
law
And
the
days
were
not
expired
Samuel
and
David
arose
and
went
and
his
men
and
slew
the
Philistines
two
hundred
men
and
David
brought
their
foreskins
and
they
gave
them
full
number
the
king
that
might
the
king
son
law
And
Saul
gave
him
Michal
his
daughter
wife
Samuel
And
Saul
saw
and
knew
that
Jehovah
was
with
David
and
Michal
Saul
daughter
loved
him
Samuel
And
Saul
was
yet
the
more
afraid
David
and
Saul
was
David
enemy
continually
Samuel
Then
the
princes
the
Philistines
went
forth
and
came
pass
often
they
went
forth
that
David
behaved
himself
more
wisely
than
all
the
servants
Saul
that
his
name
was
much
set
Samuel
And
Saul
spake
Jonathan
his
son
and
all
his
servants
that
they
should
slay
David
But
Jonathan
Saul
son
delighted
much
David
Samuel
And
Jonathan
told
David
saying
Saul
father
seeketh
slay
thee
now
therefore
pray
thee
take
heed
thyself
the
morning
and
abide
secret
place
and
hide
thyself
Samuel
and
will
out
and
stand
beside
father
the
field
where
thou
art
and
will
commune
with
father
thee
and
see
aught
will
tell
thee
Samuel
And
Jonathan
spake
good
David
unto
Saul
his
father
and
said
unto
him
Let
not
the
king
sin
against
his
servant
against
David
because
hath
not
sinned
against
thee
and
because
his
works
have
been
thee
ward
very
good
Samuel
for
put
his
life
his
hand
and
smote
the
Philistine
and
Jehovah
wrought
great
victory
for
all
Israel
thou
sawest
and
didst
rejoice
wherefore
then
wilt
thou
sin
against
innocent
blood
slay
David
without
cause
Samuel
And
Saul
hearkened
unto
the
voice
Jonathan
and
Saul
sware
Jehovah
liveth
shall
not
put
death
Samuel
And
Jonathan
called
David
and
Jonathan
showed
him
all
those
things
And
Jonathan
brought
David
Saul
and
was
his
presence
beforetime
Samuel
And
there
was
war
again
and
David
went
out
and
fought
with
the
Philistines
and
slew
them
with
great
slaughter
and
they
fled
before
him
Samuel
And
evil
spirit
from
Jehovah
was
upon
Saul
sat
his
house
with
his
spear
his
hand
and
David
was
playing
with
his
hand
Samuel
And
Saul
sought
smite
David
even
the
wall
with
the
spear
but
slipped
away
out
Saul
presence
and
smote
the
spear
into
the
wall
and
David
fled
and
escaped
that
night
Samuel
And
Saul
sent
messengers
unto
David
house
watch
him
and
slay
him
the
morning
and
Michal
David
wife
told
him
saying
thou
save
not
thy
life
night
morrow
thou
wilt
slain
Samuel
Michal
let
David
down
through
the
window
and
went
and
fled
and
escaped
Samuel
And
Michal
took
the
teraphim
and
laid
the
bed
and
put
pillow
goats
hair
the
head
thereof
and
covered
with
the
clothes
Samuel
And
when
Saul
sent
messengers
take
David
she
said
sick
Samuel
And
Saul
sent
the
messengers
see
David
saying
Bring
him
the
bed
that
may
slay
him
Samuel
And
when
the
messengers
came
behold
the
teraphim
was
the
bed
with
the
pillow
goats
hair
the
head
thereof
Samuel
And
Saul
said
unto
Michal
Why
hast
thou
deceived
thus
and
let
mine
enemy
that
escaped
And
Michal
answered
Saul
said
unto
Let
why
should
kill
thee
Samuel
Now
David
fled
and
escaped
and
came
Samuel
Ramah
and
told
him
all
that
Saul
had
done
him
And
and
Samuel
went
and
dwelt
Naioth
Samuel
And
was
told
Saul
saying
Behold
David
Naioth
Ramah
Samuel
And
Saul
sent
messengers
take
David
and
when
they
saw
the
company
the
prophets
prophesying
and
Samuel
standing
head
over
them
the
Spirit
God
came
upon
the
messengers
Saul
and
they
also
prophesied
Samuel
And
when
was
told
Saul
sent
other
messengers
and
they
also
prophesied
And
Saul
sent
messengers
again
the
third
time
and
they
also
prophesied
Samuel
Then
went
also
Ramah
and
came
the
great
well
that
Secu
and
asked
and
said
Where
are
Samuel
and
David
And
one
said
Behold
they
are
Naioth
Ramah
Samuel
And
went
thither
Naioth
Ramah
and
the
Spirit
God
came
upon
him
also
and
went
and
prophesied
until
came
Naioth
Ramah
Samuel
And
also
stripped
off
his
clothes
and
also
prophesied
before
Samuel
and
lay
down
naked
all
that
day
and
all
that
night
Wherefore
they
say
Saul
also
among
the
prophets
Samuel
And
David
fled
from
Naioth
Ramah
and
came
and
said
before
Jonathan
What
have
done
what
mine
iniquity
and
what
sin
before
thy
father
that
seeketh
life
Samuel
And
said
unto
him
Far
from
thou
shalt
not
die
behold
father
doeth
nothing
either
great
small
but
that
discloseth
unto
and
why
should
father
hide
this
thing
from
not
Samuel
And
David
sware
moreover
and
said
Thy
father
knoweth
well
that
have
found
favor
thine
eyes
and
saith
Let
not
Jonathan
know
this
lest
grieved
but
truly
Jehovah
liveth
and
thy
soul
liveth
there
but
step
between
and
death
Samuel
Then
said
Jonathan
unto
David
Whatsoever
thy
soul
desireth
will
even
for
thee
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
Jonathan
Behold
morrow
the
new
moon
and
should
not
fail
sit
with
the
king
meat
but
let
that
may
hide
myself
the
field
unto
the
third
day
even
Samuel
thy
father
miss
all
then
say
David
earnestly
asked
leave
that
might
run
Beth
lehem
his
city
for
the
yearly
sacrifice
there
for
all
the
family
Samuel
say
thus
well
thy
servant
shall
have
peace
but
wroth
then
know
that
evil
determined
him
Samuel
Therefore
deal
kindly
with
thy
servant
for
thou
hast
brought
thy
servant
into
covenant
Jehovah
with
thee
but
there
iniquity
slay
thyself
for
why
shouldest
thou
bring
thy
father
Samuel
And
Jonathan
said
Far
from
thee
for
should
all
know
that
evil
were
determined
father
come
upon
thee
then
would
not
tell
thee
Samuel
Then
said
David
Jonathan
Who
shall
tell
perchance
thy
father
answer
thee
roughly
Samuel
And
Jonathan
said
unto
David
Come
and
let
out
into
the
field
And
they
went
out
both
them
into
the
field
Samuel
And
Jonathan
said
unto
David
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
witness
when
have
sounded
father
about
this
time
morrow
the
third
day
behold
there
good
toward
David
shall
not
then
send
unto
thee
and
disclose
unto
thee
Samuel
Jehovah
Jonathan
and
more
also
should
please
father
thee
evil
disclose
not
unto
thee
and
send
thee
away
that
thou
mayest
peace
and
Jehovah
with
thee
hath
been
with
father
Samuel
And
thou
shalt
not
only
while
yet
live
show
the
lovingkindness
Jehovah
that
die
not
Samuel
but
also
thou
shalt
not
cut
off
thy
kindness
from
house
for
ever
not
when
Jehovah
hath
cut
off
the
enemies
David
every
one
from
the
face
the
earth
Samuel
Jonathan
made
covenant
with
the
house
David
saying
And
Jehovah
will
require
the
hand
David
enemies
Samuel
And
Jonathan
caused
David
swear
again
for
the
love
that
had
him
for
loved
him
loved
his
own
soul
Samuel
Then
Jonathan
said
unto
him
morrow
the
new
moon
and
thou
wilt
missed
because
thy
seat
will
empty
Samuel
And
when
thou
hast
stayed
three
days
thou
shalt
down
quickly
and
come
the
place
where
thou
didst
hide
thyself
when
the
business
was
hand
and
shalt
remain
the
stone
Ezel
Samuel
And
will
shoot
three
arrows
the
side
thereof
though
shot
mark
Samuel
And
behold
will
send
the
lad
saying
find
the
arrows
say
unto
the
lad
Behold
the
arrows
are
this
side
thee
take
them
and
come
for
there
peace
thee
and
hurt
Jehovah
liveth
Samuel
But
say
thus
unto
the
boy
Behold
the
arrows
are
beyond
thee
thy
way
for
Jehovah
hath
sent
thee
away
Samuel
And
touching
the
matter
which
thou
and
have
spoken
behold
Jehovah
between
thee
and
for
ever
Samuel
David
hid
himself
the
field
and
when
the
new
moon
was
come
the
king
sat
him
down
eat
food
Samuel
And
the
king
sat
upon
his
seat
other
times
even
upon
the
seat
the
wall
and
Jonathan
stood
and
Abner
sat
Saul
side
but
David
place
was
empty
Samuel
Nevertheless
Saul
spake
not
anything
that
day
for
thought
Something
hath
befallen
him
not
clean
surely
not
clean
Samuel
And
came
pass
the
morrow
after
the
new
moon
which
was
the
second
day
that
David
place
was
empty
and
Saul
said
unto
Jonathan
his
son
Wherefore
cometh
not
the
son
Jesse
meat
neither
yesterday
nor
day
Samuel
And
Jonathan
answered
Saul
David
earnestly
asked
leave
Beth
lehem
Samuel
and
said
Let
pray
thee
for
our
family
hath
sacrifice
the
city
and
brother
hath
commanded
there
and
now
have
found
favor
thine
eyes
let
get
away
pray
thee
and
see
brethren
Therefore
not
come
unto
the
king
table
Samuel
Then
Saul
anger
was
kindled
against
Jonathan
and
said
unto
him
Thou
son
perverse
rebellious
woman
not
know
that
thou
hast
chosen
the
son
Jesse
thine
own
shame
and
unto
the
shame
thy
mother
nakedness
Samuel
For
long
the
son
Jesse
liveth
upon
the
ground
thou
shalt
not
established
nor
thy
kingdom
Wherefore
now
send
and
fetch
him
unto
for
shall
surely
die
Samuel
And
Jonathan
answered
Saul
his
father
and
said
unto
him
Wherefore
should
put
death
what
hath
done
Samuel
And
Saul
cast
his
spear
him
smite
him
whereby
Jonathan
knew
that
was
determined
his
father
put
David
death
Samuel
Jonathan
arose
from
the
table
fierce
anger
and
did
eat
food
the
second
day
the
month
for
was
grieved
for
David
because
his
father
had
done
him
shame
Samuel
And
came
pass
the
morning
that
Jonathan
went
out
into
the
field
the
time
appointed
with
David
and
little
lad
with
him
Samuel
And
said
unto
his
lad
Run
find
now
the
arrows
which
shoot
And
the
lad
ran
shot
arrow
beyond
him
Samuel
And
when
the
lad
was
come
the
place
the
arrow
which
Jonathan
had
shot
Jonathan
cried
after
the
lad
and
said
not
the
arrow
beyond
thee
Samuel
And
Jonathan
cried
after
the
lad
Make
speed
haste
stay
not
And
Jonathan
lad
gathered
the
arrows
and
came
his
master
Samuel
But
the
lad
knew
not
anything
only
Jonathan
and
David
knew
the
matter
Samuel
And
Jonathan
gave
his
weapons
unto
his
lad
and
said
unto
him
carry
them
the
city
Samuel
And
soon
the
lad
was
gone
David
arose
out
place
toward
the
South
and
fell
his
face
the
ground
and
bowed
himself
three
times
and
they
kissed
one
another
and
wept
one
with
another
until
David
exceeded
Samuel
And
Jonathan
said
David
peace
forasmuch
have
sworn
both
the
name
Jehovah
saying
Jehovah
shall
between
and
thee
and
between
seed
and
thy
seed
for
ever
And
arose
and
departed
and
Jonathan
went
into
the
city
Samuel
Then
came
David
Nob
Ahimelech
the
priest
and
Ahimelech
came
meet
David
trembling
and
said
unto
him
Why
art
thou
alone
and
man
with
thee
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
Ahimelech
the
priest
The
king
hath
commanded
business
and
hath
said
unto
Let
man
know
anything
the
business
whereabout
send
thee
and
what
have
commanded
thee
and
have
appointed
the
young
men
such
and
such
place
Samuel
Now
therefore
what
under
thy
hand
give
five
loaves
bread
hand
whatsoever
there
present
Samuel
And
the
priest
answered
David
and
said
There
common
bread
under
hand
but
there
holy
bread
only
the
young
men
have
kept
themselves
from
women
Samuel
And
David
answered
the
priest
and
said
unto
him
truth
women
have
been
kept
from
about
these
three
days
when
came
out
the
vessels
the
young
men
were
holy
though
was
but
common
journey
how
much
more
then
day
shall
their
vessels
holy
Samuel
the
priest
gave
him
holy
bread
for
there
was
bread
there
but
the
showbread
that
was
taken
from
before
Jehovah
put
hot
bread
the
day
when
was
taken
away
Samuel
Now
certain
man
the
servants
Saul
was
there
that
day
detained
before
Jehovah
and
his
name
was
Doeg
the
Edomite
the
chiefest
the
herdsmen
that
belonged
Saul
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
Ahimelech
And
there
not
here
under
thy
hand
spear
sword
for
have
neither
brought
sword
nor
weapons
with
because
the
king
business
required
haste
Samuel
And
the
priest
said
The
sword
Goliath
the
Philistine
whom
thou
slewest
the
vale
Elah
behold
here
wrapped
cloth
behind
the
ephod
thou
wilt
take
that
take
for
there
other
save
that
here
And
David
said
There
none
like
that
give
Samuel
And
David
arose
and
fled
that
day
for
fear
Saul
and
went
Achish
the
king
Gath
Samuel
And
the
servants
Achish
said
unto
him
not
this
David
the
king
the
land
did
they
not
sing
one
another
him
dances
saying
Saul
hath
slain
his
thousands
And
David
his
ten
thousands
Samuel
And
David
laid
these
words
his
heart
and
was
sore
afraid
Achish
the
king
Gath
Samuel
And
changed
his
behavior
before
them
and
feigned
himself
mad
their
hands
and
scrabbled
the
doors
the
gate
and
let
his
spittle
fall
down
upon
his
beard
Samuel
Then
said
Achish
unto
his
servants
see
the
man
mad
wherefore
then
have
brought
him
Samuel
lack
madmen
that
have
brought
this
fellow
play
the
madman
presence
shall
this
fellow
come
into
house
Samuel
David
therefore
departed
thence
and
escaped
the
cave
Adullam
and
when
his
brethren
and
all
his
father
house
heard
they
went
down
thither
him
Samuel
And
every
one
that
was
distress
and
every
one
that
was
debt
and
every
one
that
was
discontented
gathered
themselves
unto
him
and
became
captain
over
them
and
there
were
with
him
about
four
hundred
men
Samuel
And
David
went
thence
Mizpeh
Moab
and
said
unto
the
king
Moab
Let
father
and
mother
pray
thee
come
forth
and
with
you
till
know
what
God
will
for
Samuel
And
brought
them
before
the
king
Moab
and
they
dwelt
with
him
all
the
while
that
David
was
the
stronghold
Samuel
And
the
prophet
Gad
said
unto
David
Abide
not
the
stronghold
depart
and
get
thee
into
the
land
Judah
Then
David
departed
and
came
into
the
forest
Hereth
Samuel
And
Saul
heard
that
David
was
discovered
and
the
men
that
were
with
him
now
Saul
was
sitting
Gibeah
under
the
tamarisk
tree
Ramah
with
his
spear
his
hand
and
all
his
servants
were
standing
about
him
Samuel
And
Saul
said
unto
his
servants
that
stood
about
him
Hear
now
Benjamites
will
the
son
Jesse
give
every
one
you
fields
and
vineyards
will
make
you
all
captains
thousands
and
captains
hundreds
Samuel
that
all
you
have
conspired
against
and
there
none
that
discloseth
when

league
with
the
son
Jesse
and
there
none
you
that
sorry
for

unto
that
son
hath
stirred
servant

this
day
Samuel
Then
answered
Doeg
the
Edomite
who
stood
the
servants
Saul
and
said
saw
the
son
Jesse
coming
Nob
Ahimelech
the
son
Ahitub
Samuel
And
inquired
Jehovah
for
him
and
gave
him
victuals
and
gave
him
the
sword
Goliath
the
Philistine
Samuel
Then
the
king
sent
call
Ahimelech
the
priest
the
son
Ahitub
and
all
his
father
house
the
priests
that
were
Nob
and
they
came
all
them
the
king
Samuel
And
Saul
said
Hear
now
thou
son
Ahitub
And
answered
Here
lord
Samuel
And
Saul
said
unto
him
Why
have
conspired
against
thou
and
the
son
Jesse
that
thou
hast
given
him
bread
and
sword
and
hast
inquired
God
for
him
that
should
rise
against
lie
wait
this
day
Samuel
Then
Ahimelech
answered
the
king
and
said
And
who
among
all
thy
servants

David
who

king
son

Samuel
Have

the
king
impute
anything
unto
his
servant
nor
all
the
house
father
for
thy
servant
knoweth
nothing
all
this
less
more
Samuel
And
the
king
said
Thou
shalt
surely
die
Ahimelech
thou
and
all
thy
father
house
Samuel
And
the
king
said
unto
the
guard
that
stood
about
him
Turn
and
slay
the
priests
Jehovah
because
their
hand
also
with
David
and
because
they
knew
that
fled
and
did
not
disclose
But
the
servants
the
king
would
not
put
forth
their
hand
fall
upon
the
priests
Jehovah
Samuel
And
the
king
said
Doeg
Turn
thou
and
fall
upon
the
priests
And
Doeg
the
Edomite
turned
and
fell
upon
the
priests
and
slew
that
day
fourscore
and
five
persons
that
did
wear
linen
ephod
Samuel
And
Nob
the

the
priests
smote
with
the

sword
both
men
and
women
children
and
sucklings
and
oxen
and

and
sheep
with

Samuel
And
one
the
sons
Ahimelech
the
son
Ahitub
named
Abiathar
escaped
and
fled
after
David
Samuel
And
Abiathar
told
David
that
Saul
had
slain
Jehovah
priests
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
Abiathar

that
day
when
Doeg
the
Edomite
was
there
that

surely
tell
Saul

house
Samuel
Abide
thou
with
fear
not
for
that
seeketh
life
seeketh
thy
life
for
with

shalt
safeguard
Samuel
And
they
told
David
saying
Behold
the
Philistines
are
fighting
against
Keilah
and
are
robbing
the
threshing
floors
Samuel
Therefore
David
inquired
Jehovah
saying
Shall
and
smite
these
Philistines
And
Jehovah
said
unto
David
and
smite
the
Philistines
and
save
Keilah
Samuel
And
David
men
said
unto
him
Behold
are
afraid
here
Judah
how
much
more
then
Keilah
against
the
armies
the
Philistines
Samuel
Then
David
inquired
Jehovah
yet
again
And
Jehovah
answered
him
and
said
Arise
down
Keilah
for
will
deliver
the
Philistines
into
thy
hand
Samuel
And
David
and
his
men
went
Keilah
and
fought
with
the
Philistines
and
brought
away
their
cattle
and
slew
them
with
great
slaughter
David
saved
the
inhabitants
Keilah
Samuel
And
came
pass
when
Abiathar
the
son
Ahimelech
fled
David
Keilah
that
came
down
with
ephod
his
hand
Samuel
And
was
told
Saul
that
David
was
come
Keilah
And
Saul
said
God
hath
delivered
him
into
hand
for
shut
entering
into
town
that
hath
gates
and
bars
Samuel
And
Saul
summoned
all
the
people
war
down
Keilah
besiege
David
and
his
men
Samuel
And
David
knew
that
Saul
was
devising
mischief
against
him
and
said
Abiathar
the
priest
Bring
hither
the
ephod
Samuel
Then
said
David
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
thy
servant
hath
surely
heard
that
Saul
seeketh
come
Keilah
destroy
the
city
for
sake
Samuel
Will

his
hand
will
Saul
come
down
thy
servant
hath
heard
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
beseech
thee
tell
thy
servant
And
Jehovah
said
will
come
down
Samuel
Then
said
David
Will
the
men
Keilah
deliver
and
men
into
the
hand
Saul
And
Jehovah
said
They
will
deliver
thee
Samuel
Then
David
and
his
men
who
were
about
six
hundred
arose
and
departed
out
Keilah
and
went
whithersoever
they
could
And
was
told
Saul
that
David
was
escaped
from
Keilah
and
forbare
forth
Samuel
And
David
abode
the
wilderness
the
strongholds
and
remained
the
hill
country
the
wilderness
Ziph
And
Saul
sought
him
every
day
but
God
delivered
him
not
into
his
hand
Samuel
And
David
saw
that
Saul
was
come
out
seek
his
life
and
David
was
the
wilderness
Ziph
the
wood
Samuel
And
Jonathan
Saul
son
arose
and
went
David
into
the
wood
and
strengthened
his
hand
God
Samuel
And
said
unto
him
Fear
not
for
the
hand
Saul
father
shall
not
find
thee
and
thou
shalt
king
over
Israel
and
shall
next
unto
thee
and
that
also
Saul
father
knoweth
Samuel
And
they
two
made
covenant
before
Jehovah
and
David
abode
the
wood
and
Jonathan
went
his
house
Samuel
Then
came
the
Ziphites
Saul
Gibeah
saying
Doth
not
David
hide
himself
with
the
strongholds
the
wood
the
hill
Hachilah
which

desert
Samuel
Now
therefore
king
come
down
according
all
the
desire
thy
soul
come
down
and
our
part
shall
deliver
him
into
the
king
hand
Samuel
And
Saul
said
Blessed
Jehovah
for
have
had
compassion
Samuel
pray
you
make
yet
more
sure
and
know
and
see
his
place
where
his
haunt
and
who
hath
seen
him
there
for
told
that
dealeth
very
subtly
Samuel
See
therefore
and
take
knowledge
all
the
lurking
places
where
hideth
himself
and
come
again
certainty
and
will
with
you
and
shall
come
pass
the
land
that
will
search
him
out
among
all
the
thousands
Judah
Samuel
And
they
arose
and
went
Ziph
before
Saul
but
David
and
his
men
were
the
wilderness
Maon
the
Arabah
the
south
the
desert
Samuel
And
Saul
and
his
men
went
seek
him
And
they
told
David
wherefore
came
down
the
rock
and
abode
the
wilderness
Maon
And
when
Saul
heard
that
pursued
after
David
the
wilderness
Maon
Samuel
And
Saul
went
this
side
the
mountain
and
David
and
his
men
that
side
the
mountain
and
David
made
haste
get
away
for
fear
Saul
for
Saul
and
his
men
compassed
David
and
his
men
round
about
take
them
Samuel
But
there
came
messenger
unto
Saul
saying
Haste
thee
and
come
for
the
Philistines
have
made
raid
upon
the
land
Samuel
Saul
returned
from
pursuing
after
David
and
went
against
the
Philistines
therefore
they
called
that
place
Sela
hammahlekoth
Samuel
And
David
went
from
thence
and
dwelt
the
strongholds
gedi
Samuel
And
came
pass
when
Saul
was
returned
from
following
the
Philistines
that
was
told
him
saying
Behold
David
the
wilderness
gedi
Samuel
Then
Saul
took
three
thousand
chosen
men
out
all
Israel
and
went
seek
David
and
his
men
upon
the
rocks
the
wild
goats
Samuel
And
came
the
sheepcotes
the
way
where
was
cave
and
Saul
went
cover
his
feet
Now
David
and
his
men
were
abiding
the
innermost
parts
the
cave
Samuel
And
the
men
David
said
unto
him
Behold
the
day
which
Jehovah
said
unto
thee
Behold
will
deliver
thine
enemy
into
thy
hand
and
thou
shalt
him
shall
seem
good
unto
thee
Then
David
arose
and
cut
off
the
skirt
Saul
robe
privily
Samuel
And
came
pass
afterward
that
David
heart
smote
him
because
had
cut
off
Saul
skirt
Samuel
And
said
unto
his
men
Jehovah
forbid
that
should
this
thing
unto
lord
Jehovah
anointed
put
forth
hand
against
him
seeing
Jehovah
anointed
Samuel
David
checked
his
men
with
these
words
and
suffered
them
not
rise
against
Saul
And
Saul
rose
out
the
cave
and
went
his
way
Samuel
David
also
arose
afterward
and
went
out
the
cave
and
cried
after
Saul
saying
lord
the
king
And
when
Saul
looked
behind
him
David
bowed
with
his
face
the
earth
and
did
obeisance
Samuel
And
David
said
Saul
Wherefore
hearkenest
thou
men
words
saying
Behold
David
seeketh
thy
hurt
Samuel
Behold
this
day
thine
eyes
have
seen
how
that
Jehovah
had
delivered
thee
day
into
hand
the
cave
and
some
bade
kill
thee
but
mine
eye
spared
thee
and
said
will
not
put
forth
hand
against
lord
for
Jehovah
anointed
Samuel
Moreover
father
see
yea
see
the
skirt
thy
robe
hand
for
that
cut
off
the
skirt
thy
robe
and
killed
thee
not
know
thou
and
see
that
there
neither
evil
nor
transgression
hand
and
have
not
sinned
against
thee
though
thou
huntest
after
life
take
Samuel
Jehovah
judge
between
and
thee
and
Jehovah
avenge
thee
but
hand
shall
not
upon
thee
Samuel
saith
the
proverb
the
ancients
Out
the
wicked
cometh
forth
wickedness
but
hand
shall
not
upon
thee
Samuel
After
whom
the
king
Israel
come
out
after
whom
dost
thou
pursue
after
dead
dog
after
flea
Samuel
Jehovah
therefore
judge
and
give
sentence
between
and
thee
and
see
and
plead
cause
and
deliver
out
thy
hand
Samuel
And
came
pass
when
David
had
made
end
speaking
these
words
unto
Saul
that
Saul
said
this
thy
voice
son
David
And
Saul
lifted
his
voice
and
wept
Samuel
And
said
David
Thou
art
more
righteous
than
for
thou
hast
rendered
unto
good
whereas
have
rendered
unto
thee
evil
Samuel
And
thou
hast
declared
this
day
how
that
thou
hast
dealt
well
with
forasmuch
when
Jehovah
had
delivered
into
thy
hand
thou
killedst
not
Samuel
For
man
find
his
enemy
will
let
him
well
away
wherefore
Jehovah
reward
thee
good
for
that
which
thou
hast
done
unto
this
day
Samuel
And
now
behold
know
that
thou
shalt
surely
king
and
that
the
kingdom
Israel
shall
established
thy
hand
Samuel
Swear
now
therefore
unto
Jehovah
that
thou
wilt
not
cut
off
seed
after
and
that
thou
wilt
not
destroy
name
out
father
house
Samuel
And
David
sware
unto
Saul
And
Saul
went
home
but
David
and
his
men
gat
them
unto
the
stronghold
Samuel
And
Samuel
died
and
all
Israel
gathered
themselves
together
and
lamented
him
and
buried
him
his
house
Ramah
And
David
arose
and
went
down
the
wilderness
Paran
Samuel
And
there
was
man
Maon
whose
possessions
were
Carmel
and
the
man
was
very
great
and
had
three
thousand
sheep
and
thousand
goats
and
was
shearing
his
sheep
Carmel
Samuel
Now
the
name
the
man
was
Nabal
and
the
name
his
wife
Abigail
and
the
woman
was
good
understanding
and
beautiful
countenance
but
the
man
was
churlish
and
evil
his
doings
and
was
the
house
Caleb
Samuel
And
David
heard
the
wilderness
that
Nabal
was
shearing
his
sheep
Samuel
And
David
sent
ten
young
men
and
David
said
unto
the
young
men
Get
you
Carmel
and
Nabal
and
greet
him
name
Samuel
and
thus
shall
say
him
that
liveth
prosperity
Peace
unto
thee
and
peace
thy
house
and
peace
unto
all
that
thou
hast
Samuel
And
now
have
heard
that
thou
hast
shearers
thy
shepherds
have
now
been
with
and
did
them
hurt
neither
was
there
aught
missing
unto
them
all
the
while
they
were
Carmel
Samuel
Ask
thy
young
men
and
they
will
tell
thee
wherefore
let
the
young
men
find
favor
thine
eyes
for
come
good
day
give
pray
thee
whatsoever
cometh
thy
hand
unto
thy
servants
and
thy
son
David
Samuel
And
when
David
young
men
came
they
spake
Nabal
according
all
those
words
the
name
David
and
ceased
Samuel
And
Nabal
answered
David
servants
and
said
Who
David
and
who
the
son
Jesse
there
are
many
servants
now
days
that
break
away
every
man
from
his
master
Samuel
Shall
then
take
bread
and
water
and
flesh
that
have
killed
for
shearers
and
give
unto
men
whom
know
not
whence
they
are
Samuel
David
young
men
turned
their
way
and
went
back
and
came
and
told
him
according
all
these
words
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
his
men
Gird
every
man
his
sword
And
they
girded
every
man
his
sword
and
David
also
girded
his
sword
and
there
went
after
David
about
four
hundred
men
and
two
hundred
abode
the
baggage
Samuel
But
one
the
young
men
told
Abigail
Nabal
wife
saying
Behold
David
sent
messengers
out
the
wilderness
salute
our
master
and
railed
them
Samuel
But
the
men
were
very
good
unto
and
were
not
hurt
neither
missed
anything
long
went
with
them
when
were
the
fields
Samuel
they
were
wall
unto
both
night
and
day
all
the
while
were
with
them
keeping
the
sheep
Samuel
Now
therefore
know
and
consider
what
thou
wilt
for
evil
determined
against
our
master
and
against
all
his
house
for
such
worthless
fellow
that
one
cannot
speak
him
Samuel
Then
Abigail
made
haste
and
took
two
hundred
loaves
and
two
bottles
wine
and
five
sheep
ready
dressed
and
five
measures
parched
grain
and
hundred
clusters
raisins
and
two
hundred
cakes
figs
and
laid
them
asses
Samuel
And
she
said
unto
her
young
men
before
behold
come
after
you
But
she
told
not
her
husband
Nabal
Samuel
And
was
she
rode
her
ass
and
came
down
the
covert
the
mountain
that
behold
David
and
his
men
came
down
toward
her
and
she
met
them
Samuel
Now
David
had
said
Surely
vain
have
kept
all
that
this
fellow
hath
the
wilderness
that
nothing
was
missed
all
that
pertained
unto
him
and
hath
returned
evil
for
good
Samuel
God
unto
the
enemies
David
and
more
also
leave
all
that
pertain
him
the
morning
light
much
one
man
child
Samuel
And
when
Abigail
saw
David
she
hasted
and
alighted
from
her
ass
and
fell
before
David
her
face
and
bowed
herself
the
ground
Samuel
And
she
fell
his
feet
and
said
Upon
lord
upon
the
iniquity
and
let
thy
handmaid
pray
thee
speak
thine
ears
and
hear
thou
the
words
thy
handmaid
Samuel
Let
not
lord
pray
thee
regard
this
worthless
fellow
even
Nabal
for
his
name
Nabal
his
name
and
folly
with
him
but
thy
handmaid
saw
not
the
young
men
lord
whom
thou
didst
send
Samuel
Now
therefore
lord
Jehovah
liveth
and
thy
soul
liveth
seeing
Jehovah
hath
withholden
thee
from
bloodguiltiness
and
from
avenging
thyself
with
thine
own
hand
now
therefore
let
thine
enemies
and
them
that
seek
evil
lord
Nabal
Samuel
And
now
this
present
which
thy
servant
hath
brought
unto
lord
let
given
unto
the
young
men
that
follow
lord
Samuel
Forgive
pray
thee
the
trespass
thy
handmaid
for
Jehovah
will
certainly
make
lord
sure
house
because
lord
fighteth
the
battles
Jehovah
and
evil
shall
not
found
thee
all
thy
days
Samuel
And
though
men
risen
pursue
thee
and
seek
thy
soul
yet
the
soul
lord
shall
bound
the
bundle
life
with
Jehovah
thy
God
and
the
souls
thine
enemies
them
shall
sling
out
from
the
hollow
sling
Samuel
And
shall
come
pass
when
Jehovah
shall
have
done
lord
according
all
the
good
that
hath
spoken
concerning
thee
and
shall
have
appointed
thee
prince
over
Israel
Samuel
that
this
shall
grief
unto
thee
nor
offence
heart
unto
lord
either
that
thou
hast
shed
blood
without
cause
that
lord
hath
avenged
himself
And
when
Jehovah
shall
have
dealt
well
with
lord
then
remember
thy
handmaid
Samuel
And
David
said
Abigail
Blessed
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
who
sent
thee
this
day
meet
Samuel
and
blessed
thy
discretion
and
blessed
thou
that
hast
kept
this
day
from
bloodguiltiness
and
from
avenging
myself
with
mine
own
hand
Samuel
For
very
deed
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
liveth
who
hath
withholden
from
hurting
thee
except
thou
hadst
hasted
and
come
meet
surely
there
had
not
been
left
unto
Nabal
the
morning
light
much
one
man
child
Samuel
David
received
her
hand
that
which
she
had
brought
him
and
said
unto
her
peace
thy
house
see
have
hearkened
thy
voice
and
have
accepted
thy
person
Samuel
And
Abigail
came
Nabal
and
behold
held
feast
his
house
like
the
feast
king
and
Nabal
heart
was
merry
within
him
for
was
very
drunken
wherefore
she
told
him
nothing
less
more
until
the
morning
light
Samuel
And
came
pass
the
morning
when
the
wine
was
gone
out
Nabal
that
his
wife
told
him
these
things
and
his
heart
died
within
him
and
became
stone
Samuel
And
came
pass
about
ten
days
after
that
Jehovah
smote
Nabal
that
died
Samuel
And
when
David
heard
that
Nabal
was
dead
said
Blessed
Jehovah
that
hath
pleaded
the
cause
reproach
from
the
hand
Nabal
and
hath
kept
back
his
servant
from
evil
and
the
evil
doing
Nabal
hath
Jehovah
returned
upon
his
own
head
And
David
sent
and
spake
concerning
Abigail
take
her
him
wife
Samuel
And
when
the
servants
David
were
come
Abigail
Carmel
they
spake
unto
her
saying
David
hath
sent
unto
thee
take
thee
him
wife
Samuel
And
she
arose
and
bowed
herself
with
her
face
the
earth
and
said
Behold
thy
handmaid
servant
wash
the
feet
the
servants
lord
Samuel
And
Abigail
hasted
and
arose
and
rode
upon
ass
with
five
damsels
hers
that
followed
her
and
she
went
after
the
messengers
David
and
became
his
wife
Samuel
David
also
took
Ahinoam
Jezreel
and
they
became
both
them
his
wives
Samuel
Now
Saul
had
given
Michal
his
daughter
David
wife
Palti
the
son
Laish
who
was
Gallim
Samuel
And
the
Ziphites
came
unto
Saul
Gibeah
saying
Doth
not
David
hide
himself
the
hill
Hachilah
which
before
the
desert
Samuel
Then
Saul
arose
and
went
down
the
wilderness
Ziph
having
three
thousand
chosen
men
Israel
with
him
seek
David
the
wilderness
Ziph
Samuel
And
Saul
encamped
the
hill
Hachilah
which
before
the
desert
the
way
But
David
abode
the
wilderness
and
saw
that
Saul
came
after
him
into
the
wilderness
Samuel
David
therefore
sent
out
spies
and
understood
that
Saul
was
come
certainty
Samuel
And
David
arose
and
came
the
place
where
Saul
had
encamped
and
David
beheld
the
place
where
Saul
lay
and
Abner
the
son
Ner
the
captain
his
host
and
Saul
lay
within
the
place
the
wagons
and
the
people
were
encamped
round
about
him
Samuel
Then
answered
David
and
said
Ahimelech
the
Hittite
and
Abishai
the
son
Zeruiah
brother
Joab
saying
Who
will
down
with
Saul
the
camp
And
Abishai
said
will
down
with
thee
Samuel
David
and
Abishai
came
the
people
night
and
behold
Saul
lay
sleeping
within
the
place
the
wagons
with
his
spear
stuck
the
ground
his
head
and
Abner
and
the
people
lay
round
about
him
Samuel
Then
said
Abishai
David
God
hath
delivered
thine
enemy
into
thy
hand
this
day
now
therefore
let
smite
him
pray
thee
with
the
spear
the
earth
one
stroke
and
will
not
smite
him
the
second
time
Samuel
And
David
said
Abishai
Destroy
him
not
for
who
can
put
forth
his
hand
against
Jehovah
anointed
and
guiltless
Samuel
And
David
said
Jehovah
liveth
Jehovah
will
smite
him
his
day
shall
come
die
shall
down
into
battle
and
perish
Samuel
Jehovah
forbid
that
should
put
forth
hand
against
Jehovah
anointed
but
now
take
pray
thee
the
spear
that
his
head
and
the
cruse
water
and
let
Samuel
David
took
the
spear
and
the
cruse
water
from
Saul
head
and
they
gat
them
away
and
man
saw
nor
knew
neither
did
any
awake
for
they
were
all
asleep
because
deep
sleep
from
Jehovah
was
fallen
upon
them
Samuel
Then
David
went
over
the
other
side
and
stood
the
top
the
mountain
afar
off
great
space
being
between
them
Samuel
and
David
cried
the
people
and
Abner
the
son
Ner
saying
Answerest
thou
not
Abner
Then
Abner
answered
and
said
Who
art
thou
that
criest
the
king
Samuel
And
David
said
Abner
Art
not
thou
valiant
man
and
who
like
thee
Israel
wherefore
then
hast
thou
not
kept
watch
over
thy
lord
the
king
for
there
came
one
the
people

the
king
thy
lord
Samuel
This
thing
not
good
that
thou
hast
done
Jehovah
liveth
are
worthy

because
have
not
kept
watch
over
your
lord
Jehovah
anointed
And
now
see
where
the
king

and
the
cruse
water
that
was
his
head
Samuel
And
Saul
knew
David
voice
and
said
this
thy
voice
son
David
And
David
said
voice
lord
king
Samuel
And
said
Wherefore
doth
lord
pursue
after
his
servant
for
what
have
done
what
evil
hand
Samuel
Now
therefore
pray
thee
let
lord
the
king
hear
the
words
his
servant
Jehovah
that
hath
stirred
thee
against
let
him
accept
offering
but
the
children
men
cursed
they
before
Jehovah
for
they
have
driven
out
this
day
that
should
not
cleave
unto
the
inheritance
Jehovah
saying
serve
other
gods
Samuel
Now
therefore
let
not
blood
fall
the
earth
away
from
the
presence
Jehovah
for
the
king
Israel
come
out
seek
flea
when
one
doth
hunt
partridge
the
mountains
Samuel
Then
said
Saul
have
sinned
return
son
David
for
will
more
thee
harm
because
life
was
precious
thine
eyes
this
day
behold
have
played
the
fool
and
have
erred
exceedingly
Samuel
And
David
answered
and
said
Behold
the
spear
king
let
then
one
the
young
men
come
over
and
fetch
Samuel
And
Jehovah
will
render
every
man
his
righteousness
and
his
faithfulness
forasmuch
Jehovah
delivered
thee
into
hand
day
and
would
not
put
forth
hand
against
Jehovah
anointed
Samuel
And
behold
thy
life
was
much
set
this
day
mine
eyes
let
life
much
set
the
eyes
Jehovah
and
let
him
deliver
out
all
tribulation
Samuel
Then
Saul
said
David
Blessed
thou
son
David
thou
shalt
both
mightily
and
shalt
surely
prevail
David
went
his
way
and
Saul
returned
his
place
Samuel
And
David
said
his
heart
shall
now
perish
one
day
the
hand
Saul
there
nothing
better
for
than
that
should
escape
into
the
land
the
Philistines
and
Saul
will
despair
seek
any
more
all
the
borders
Israel
shall
escape
out
his
hand
Samuel
And
David
arose
and
passed
over
and
the
six
hundred
men
that
were
with
him
unto
Achish
the
son
Maoch
king
Gath
Samuel
And
David
dwelt
with
Achish
Gath
and
his
men
every
man
with
his
household
even
David
with
his
two
wives
Ahinoam
the
Jezreelitess
and
Abigail
the
Carmelitess
Nabal
wife
Samuel
And
was
told
Saul
that
David
was
fled
Gath
and
sought
more
again
for
him
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
Achish
now
have
found
favor
thine
eyes
let
them
give
place
one
the
cities
the
country
that
may
dwell
there
for
why
should
thy
servant
dwell
the
royal
city
with
thee
Samuel
Then
Achish
gave
him
Ziklag
that
day
wherefore
Ziklag
pertaineth
unto
the
kings
Judah
unto
this
day
Samuel
And
the
number
the
days
that
David
dwelt
the
country
the
Philistines
was
full
year
and
four
months
Samuel
And
David
and
his
men
went
and
made
raid
upon
the
Geshurites
and
the
Girzites
and
the
Amalekites
for
those
nations
were
the
inhabitants
the
land
who
were
old
thou
goest
Shur
even
unto
the
land
Egypt
Samuel
And
David
smote
the
land
and
saved
neither
man
nor
woman
alive
and
took
away
the
sheep
and
the
oxen
and
the
asses
and
the
camels
and
the
apparel
and
returned
and
came
Achish
Samuel
And
Achish
said
Against
whom
have
made
raid
day
And
David
said
Against
the
South
Judah
and
against
the
South
the
Jerahmeelites
and
against
the
South
the
Kenites
Samuel
And
David
saved
neither
man
nor
woman
alive
bring
them
Gath
saying
Lest
they
should
tell
saying
did
David
and
hath
been
his
manner
all
the
while
hath
dwelt
the
country
the
Philistines
Samuel
And
Achish
believed
David
saying
hath
made
his
people
Israel
utterly
abhor
him
therefore
shall
servant
for
ever
Samuel
And
came
pass
those
days
that
the
Philistines
gathered
their
hosts
together
for
warfare
fight
with
Israel
And
Achish
said
unto
David
Know
thou
assuredly
that
thou
shalt
out
with
the
host
thou
and
thy
men
Samuel
And
David
said
Achish
Therefore
thou
shalt
know
what
thy
servant
will
And
Achish
said
David
Therefore
will
make
thee
keeper
head
for
ever
Samuel
Now
Samuel
was
dead
and
all
Israel
had
lamented
him
and
buried
him
Ramah
even
his
own
city
And
Saul
had
put
away
those
that
had
familiar
spirits
and
the
wizards
out
the
land
Samuel
And
the
Philistines
gathered
themselves
together
and
came
and
encamped
Shunem
and
Saul
gathered
all
Israel
together
and
they
encamped
Gilboa
Samuel
And
when
Saul
saw
the
host
the
Philistines
was
afraid
and
his
heart
trembled
greatly
Samuel
And
when
Saul
inquired
Jehovah
Jehovah
answered
him
not
neither
dreams
nor
Urim
nor
prophets
Samuel
Then
said
Saul
unto
his
servants
Seek
woman
that
hath
familiar
spirit
that
may
her
and
inquire
her
And
his
servants
said
him
Behold
there
woman
that
hath
familiar
spirit
dor
Samuel
And
Saul
disguised
himself
and
put
other
raiment
and
went
and
two
men
with
him
and
they
came
the
woman
night
and
said
Divine
unto
pray
thee
the
familiar
spirit
and
bring
whomsoever
shall
name
unto
thee
Samuel
And
the
woman
said
unto
him
Behold
thou
knowest
what
Saul
hath
done
how
hath
cut
off
those
that
have
familiar
spirits
and
the
wizards
out
the
land
wherefore
then
layest
thou
snare
for
life
cause
die
Samuel
And
Saul
sware
her
Jehovah
saying
Jehovah
liveth
there
shall
punishment
happen
thee
for
this
thing
Samuel
Then
said
the
woman
Whom
shall
bring
unto
thee
And
said
Bring
Samuel
Samuel
And
when
the
woman
saw
Samuel
she
cried
with
loud
voice
and
the
woman
spake
Saul
saying
Why
hast
thou
deceived
for
thou
art
Saul
Samuel
And
the
king
said
unto
her
not
afraid
for
what
seest
thou
And
the
woman
said
unto
Saul
see
god
coming
out
the
earth
Samuel
And
said
unto
her
What
form
And
she
said
old
man
cometh
and
covered
with
robe
And
Saul
perceived
that
was
Samuel
and
bowed
with
his
face
the
ground
and
did
obeisance
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
Saul
Why
hast
thou
disquieted
bring
And
Saul
answered
sore
distressed
for
the
Philistines
make
war
against
and
God
departed
from
and
answereth
more
neither
prophets
nor
dreams
therefore
have
called
thee
that
thou
mayest
make
known
unto
what
shall
Samuel
And
Samuel
said
Wherefore
then
dost
thou
ask
seeing
Jehovah
departed
from
thee
and
become
thine
adversary
Samuel
And
Jehovah
hath
done
unto
thee
spake
and
Jehovah
hath
rent
the
kingdom
out
thy
hand
and
given
thy
neighbor
even
David
Samuel
Because
thou
obeyedst
not
the
voice
Jehovah
and
didst
not
execute
his
fierce
wrath
upon
Amalek
therefore
hath
Jehovah
done
this
thing
unto
thee
this
day
Samuel
Moreover
Jehovah
will
deliver
Israel
also
with
thee
into
the
hand
the
Philistines
and
morrow
shalt
thou
and
thy
sons
with
Jehovah
will
deliver
the
host
Israel
also
into
the
hand
the
Philistines
Samuel
Then
Saul
fell
straightway
his
full
length
upon
the
earth
and
was
sore
afraid
because
the
words
Samuel
and
there
was
strength
him
for
had
eaten
bread
all
the
day
nor
all
the
night
Samuel
And
the
woman
came
unto
Saul
and
saw
that
was
sore
troubled
and
said
unto
him
Behold
thy
handmaid
hath
hearkened
unto
thy
voice
and
have
put
life
hand
and
have
hearkened
unto
thy
words
which
thou
spakest
unto
Samuel
Now
therefore
pray
thee
hearken
thou
also
unto
the
voice
thy
handmaid
and
let
set
morsel
bread
before
thee
and
eat
that
thou
mayest
have
strength
when
thou
goest
thy
way
Samuel
But
refused
and
said
will
not
eat
But
his
servants
together
with
the
woman
constrained
him
and
hearkened
unto
their
voice
arose
from
the
earth
and
sat
upon
the
bed
Samuel
And
the
woman
had
fatted
calf
the
house
and
she
hasted
and
killed
and
she
took
flour
and
kneaded
and
did
bake
unleavened
bread
thereof
Samuel
and
she
brought
before
Saul
and
before
his
servants
and
they
did
eat
Then
they
rose
and
went
away
that
night
Samuel
Now
the
Philistines
gathered
together
all
their
hosts
Aphek
and
the
Israelites
encamped
the
fountain
which
Jezreel
Samuel
And
the
lords
the
Philistines
passed
hundreds
and
thousands
and
David
and
his
men
passed
the
rearward
with
Achish
Samuel
Then
said
the
princes
the
Philistines
What
these
Hebrews
here
And
Achish
said
unto
the
princes
the
Philistines
not
this
David
the
servant
Saul
the
king
Israel
who
hath
been
with
these
days
rather
these
years
and
have
found
fault
him
since
fell
away
unto
unto
this
day
Samuel
But
the
princes
the
Philistines
were
wroth
with
him
and
the
princes
the
Philistines
said
unto
him
Make
the
man
return
that
may
back
his
place
where
thou
hast
appointed
him
and
let
him
not
down
with
battle
lest
the
battle
become
adversary
for
wherewith
should
this
fellow
reconcile
himself
unto
his
lord
should
not
with
the
heads
these
men
Samuel
not
this
David
whom
they
sang
one
another
dances
saying
Saul
hath
slain
his
thousands
And
David
his
ten
thousands
Samuel
Then
Achish
called
David
and
said
unto
him
Jehovah
liveth
thou
hast
been
upright
and
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
with
the
host
good
sight
for
have
not
found
evil
thee
since
the
day
thy
coming
unto
unto
this
day
nevertheless
the
lords
favor
thee
not
Samuel
Wherefore
now
return
and
peace
that
thou
displease
not
the
lords
the
Philistines
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
Achish
But
what
have
done
and
what
hast
thou
found
thy
servant
long
have
been
before
thee
unto
this
day
that
may
not
and
fight
against
the
enemies
lord
the
king
Samuel
And
Achish
answered
and
said
David
know
that
thou
art
good
sight
angel
God
notwithstanding
the
princes
the
Philistines
have
said
shall
not
with
the
battle
Samuel
Wherefore
now
rise
early
the
morning
with
the
servants
thy
lord
that
are
come
with
thee
and
soon
are
early
the
morning
and
have
light
depart
Samuel
David
rose
early
and
his
men
depart
the
morning
return
into
the
land
the
Philistines
And
the
Philistines
went
Jezreel
Samuel
And
came
pass
when
David
and
his
men
were
come
Ziklag
the
third
day
that
the
Amalekites
had
made
raid
upon
the
South
and
upon
Ziklag
and
had
smitten
Ziklag
and
burned
with
fire
Samuel
and
had
taken
captive
the
women
and
all
that
were
therein
both
small
and
great
they
slew
not
any
but
carried
them
off
and
went
their
way
Samuel
And
when
David
and
his
men
came
the
city
behold
was
burned
with
fire
and
their
wives
and
their
sons
and
their
daughters
were
taken
captive
Samuel
Then
David
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
lifted
their
voice
and
wept
until
they
had
more
power
weep
Samuel
And
David
two
wives
were
taken
captive
Ahinoam
the
Jezreelitess
and
Abigail
the
wife
Nabal
the
Carmelite
Samuel
And
David
was
greatly
distressed
for
the
people
spake
stoning
him
because
the
soul
all
the
people
was
grieved
every
man
for
his
sons
and
for
his
daughters
but
David
strengthened
himself
Jehovah
his
God
Samuel
And
David
said
Abiathar
the
priest
the
son
Ahimelech
pray
thee
bring
hither
the
ephod
And
Abiathar
brought
thither
the
ephod
David
Samuel
And
David
inquired
Jehovah
saying
pursue
after
this
troop
shall
overtake
them
And
answered
him
Pursue
for
thou
shalt
surely
overtake
them
and
shalt
without
fail
recover
all
Samuel
David
went
and
the
six
hundred
men
that
were
with
him
and
came
the
brook
Besor
where
those
that
were
left
behind
stayed
Samuel
But
David
pursued
and
four
hundred
men
for
two
hundred
stayed
behind
who
were
faint
that
they
could
not
over
the
brook
Besor
Samuel
And
they
found
Egyptian
the
field
and
brought
him
David
and
gave
him
bread
and
did
eat
and
they
gave
him
water
drink
Samuel
and
they
gave
him
piece
cake
figs
and
two
clusters
raisins
and
when
had
eaten
his
spirit
came
again
him
for
had
eaten
bread
nor
drunk
any
water
three
days
and
three
nights
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
him
whom
belongest
thou
and
whence
art
thou
And
said
young
man
Egypt
servant
Amalekite
and
master
left
because
three
days
ago
fell
sick
Samuel
made
raid
upon
the
South
the
Cherethites
and
upon
that
which
belongeth
Judah
and
upon
the
South
Caleb
and
burned
Ziklag
with
fire
Samuel
And
David
said
him
Wilt
thou
bring
down
this
troop
And
said
Swear
unto
God
that
thou
wilt
neither
kill
nor
deliver
into
the
hands
master
and
will
bring
thee
down
this
troop
Samuel
And
when
had
brought
him
down
behold
they
were
spread
abroad
over
all
the
ground
eating
and
drinking
and
dancing
because
all
the
great
spoil
that
they
had
taken
out
the
land
the
Philistines
and
out
the
land
Judah
Samuel
And
David
smote
them
from
the
twilight
even
unto
the
evening
the
next
day
and
there
escaped
not
man
them
save
four
hundred
young
men
who
rode
upon
camels
and
fled
Samuel
And
David
recovered
all
that
the
Amalekites
had
taken
and
David
rescued
his
two
wives
Samuel
And
there
was
nothing
lacking
them
neither
small
nor
great
neither
sons
nor
daughters
neither
spoil
nor
anything
that
they
had
taken
them
David
brought
back
all
Samuel
And
David
took
all
the
flocks
and
the
herds
which
they
drove
before
those
other
cattle
and
said
This
David
spoil
Samuel
And
David
came
the
two
hundred
men
who
were
faint
that
they
could
not
follow
David
whom
also
they
had
made
abide
the
brook
Besor
and
they
went
forth
meet
David
and
meet
the
people
that
were
with
him
and
when
David
came
near
the
people
saluted
them
Samuel
Then
answered
all
the
wicked
men
and
base
fellows
those
that
went
with
David
and
said
Because
they
went
not
with
will
not
give
them
aught
the
spoil
that
have
recovered
save
every
man
his
wife
and
his
children
that
may
lead
them
away
and
depart
Samuel
Then
said
David
shall
not
brethren
with
that
which
Jehovah
hath
given
unto
who
hath
preserved
and
delivered
the
troop
that
came
against
into
our
hand
Samuel
And
who
will
hearken
unto
you
this
matter
for
his
share
that
goeth
down
the
battle
shall
his
share
that
tarrieth
the
baggage
they
shall
share
alike
Samuel
And
was
from
that
day
forward
that
made
statute
and
ordinance
for
Israel
unto
this
day
Samuel
And
when
David
came
Ziklag
sent
the
spoil
unto
the
elders
Judah
even
his
friends
saying
Behold
present
for
you
the
spoil
the
enemies
Jehovah
Samuel
them
that
were
Beth
and
them
that
were
Ramoth
the
South
and
them
that
were
Jattir
Samuel
and
them
that
were
Aroer
and
them
that
were
Siphmoth
and
them
that
were
Eshtemoa
Samuel
and
them
that
were
Racal
and
them
that
were
the
cities
the
Jerahmeelites
and
them
that
were
the
cities
the
Kenites
Samuel
and
them
that
were
Hormah
and
them
that
were
Bor
ashan
and
them
that
were
Athach
Samuel
and
them
that
were
Hebron
and
all
the
places
where
David
himself
and
his
men
were
wont
haunt
Samuel
Now
the
Philistines
fought
against
Israel
and
the
men
Israel
fled
from
before
the
Philistines
and
fell
down
slain
mount
Gilboa
Samuel
And
the
Philistines
followed
hard
upon
Saul
and
upon
his
sons
and
the
Philistines
slew
Jonathan
and
Abinadab
and
Malchi
shua
the
sons
Saul
Samuel
And
the
battle
went
sore
against
Saul
and
the
archers
overtook
him
and
was
greatly
distressed
reason
the
archers
Samuel
Then
said
Saul
his
armorbearer
Draw
thy
sword
and
thrust
through
therewith
lest
these
uncircumcised
come
and
thrust
through
and
abuse
But
his
armorbearer
would
not
for
was
sore
afraid
Therefore
Saul
took
his
sword
and
fell
upon
Samuel
And
when
his
armorbearer
saw
that
Saul
was
dead
likewise
fell
upon
his
sword
and
died
with
him
Samuel
Saul
died
and
his
three
sons
and
his
armorbearer
and
all
his
men
that
same
day
together
Samuel
And
when
the
men
Israel
that
were
the
other
side
the
valley
and
they
that
were
beyond
the
Jordan
saw
that
the
men
Israel
fled
and
that
Saul
and
his
sons
were
dead
they
forsook
the
cities
and
fled
and
the
Philistines
came
and
dwelt
them
Samuel
And
came
pass
the
morrow
when
the
Philistines
came
strip
the
slain
that
they
found
Saul
and
his
three
sons
fallen

Gilboa
Samuel
And
they
cut
off
his
head
and
stripped
off
his
armor
and
sent
into
the
land
the
Philistines
round
about
carry
the
tidings
unto
the
house
their
idols
and
the
people
Samuel
And
they
put
his
armor

house
the
Ashtaroth
and
they
fastened
his
body

shan
Samuel
And
when
the
inhabitants

heard
concerning
him
that
which
the
Philistines
had
done
Saul
Samuel
all
the
valiant
men
arose
and
went
all
night
and
took
the
body
Saul
and
the
bodies
his
sons
from
the
wall
Beth
shan
and
they
came

and
burnt
them
there
Samuel
And
they
took
their
bones
and
buried
them
under
the
tamarisk
tree
Jabesh
and
fasted
seven
days
Samuel
And
came
pass
after
the
death

that
behold

clothes
rent
and
earth
upon
his
head
and
was
when
came
David
that
fell

earth
and
did
obeisance
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
him
From
whence
comest
thou
And
said
unto
him
Out
the
camp
Israel
escaped
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
him
How
went
the
matter
pray
thee
tell
And
answered
The
people

from
the
battle
and
many
the
people
also
are
fallen
and
dead
and
Saul
and
Jonathan
his
son
are
dead
also
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
the
young
man
that
told
him
How
knowest
thou
that
Saul
and
Jonathan
his
son
are
dead
Samuel
And
the

behold
Saul
was
leaning
upon
his

Samuel
And
when

behind
him
saw
and
called
unto
And
answered
Here
Samuel
And
said
unto
Who
art
thou
And
answered
him
Amalekite
Samuel
And
said
unto
Stand
pray
thee
beside
and
slay
for
anguish
hath
taken
hold
because
life
yet
whole
Samuel
stood
beside
him
and
slew
him
because
was
sure
that
could
not
live
after
that
was
fallen
and
took
the
crown
that
was
upon
his
head
and
the
bracelet
that
was
his
arm
and
have
brought
them
hither
unto
lord
Samuel
Then
David
took
hold
his
clothes
and
rent
them
and
likewise
all
the
men
that
were
with
him
Samuel
and
they
mourned
and
wept
and
fasted
until
even
for
Saul
and
for
Jonathan
his
son
and
for
the
people
Jehovah
and
for
the
house
Israel
because
they
were
fallen

sword
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
the
young
man
that
told
him
Whence
art
thou
And
answered
the
son
sojourner
Amalekite
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
him
How
wast
thou
not
afraid
put
forth
thy
hand
destroy
Jehovah
anointed
Samuel
And
David
called
one
the
young
men
and
said
near
and
fall
upon
him
And
smote
him
that
died
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
him
Thy
blood
upon
thy
head
for
thy
mouth
hath
testified
against
thee
saying
have
slain
Jehovah
anointed
Samuel
And
David
lamented
with
this
lamentation
over
Saul
and
over
Jonathan
his
son
Samuel
and
bade
them

From

The

Samuel
Saul
and
Jonathan
were
lovely
and
pleasant
their
lives
And
their
death
they
were
not
divided
They
were
swifter
than

They
were
stronger
than

Samuel

How

Samuel
And
came
pass
after
this
that
David
inquired
Jehovah
saying

And
Jehovah
said
unto
him
And

went
thither
and
his

David
bring
every

and
they
dwelt

Samuel
And
the

and
there
they
anointed

king
over
the
house
Judah
And
they
told
David
saying
The
men

gilead
were
they
that
buried
Saul
Samuel
And
David
sent
messengers
unto
the
men
Jabesh
gilead
and
said
unto
them
Blessed

showed
this
kindness
unto
your

Now

And

Then

And
Abner
said
him
Turn

But

And
Abner
said
again
Asahel
Turn

Samuel
And
the

gathered
themselves
together
after

and
became
one
band
and
stood

Then
Abner
called
Joab
and
said
Shall

knowest
thou
not
that
will
bitterness
the
latter
end
how
long
shall
then
ere
thou
bid
the
people
return
from
following
their
brethren
Samuel
And
Joab
said
God
liveth
thou
hadst
not
spoken
surely
then
the
morning
the
people
had
gone
away
nor
followed
every

Joab
blew
the
trumpet
and
all

And

And
they
took

and
buried

which
was

And
Joab
and
his

and
the

Now
there
was

Samuel
Now
Saul

name
was
Rizpah
the
daughter
Aiah
and
Ish
bosheth
said
Abner
Wherefore
hast

Samuel
Then
was
Abner
very
wroth
for
the

Ish

and
said

This

and
over
Judah
from
Dan
even
Beer

Samuel
And
could
not
answer
Abner
another
word
because

Samuel
And
Abner
sent

saying

land
saying
also
Make

And

thee
that
thou
shalt
not
see
face
except
thou
first
bring
Michal
Saul
daughter
when
thou

And
David
sent
messengers
Ish
bosheth
Saul
son
saying
Deliver

for
hundred
foreskins
the
Philistines
Samuel
And
Ish

even
from
Paltiel
the
son
Laish
Samuel
And
her
husband
went
with
her
weeping

followed

Then
said
Abner
unto
him

and
returned
Samuel
And
Abner
had
communication
with
the
elders
Israel
saying
times
past

Samuel
now
then
for

the
king
that
they
may
make
covenant
with

and
that
thou
mayest
reign
over
all

soul
desireth
And
David
sent

And

they
told
Joab
saying

Ner
came

Samuel
Then
Joab
came
the

and
said

Thou

from
David
sent
messengers
after
Abner
and
they
brought
him
back
from
the

Joab
took

with
him
quietly
and
smote

Thy

And

and
all

And
his

Samuel
And

Samuel
And

Samuel
How

more
when

men
have
slain
righteous
person

own
house
upon
his
bed
shall
not
now
require
his
blood
your
hand
and
take
you
away
from
the
earth
Samuel
And
David
commanded
his
young
men
and
they
slew
them
and
cut
off
their
hands
and
their
feet
and
hanged
them
beside
the

Hebron
But
they
took

Then
came

David
unto

saying
Behold

Samuel
times

Samuel
all
the
elders
Israel
came
the

and
king
David
made
covenant
with
them
Hebron
before

and
they
anointed

over
Judah
seven

and
six

Samuel
And
the

against
the
Jebusites
the
inhabitants
the
land
who
spake
unto
David
saying
Except
thou
take
away
the
blind
and
the

thou
shalt
not
come
hither
thinking
David
cannot
come
hither
Samuel
Nevertheless
David
took
the

Samuel
And
David
said
that
day
Whosoever
smiteth
the
Jebusites
let
him
get
the
watercourse
and
smite
the
lame
and
the
blind
that
are
hated
David
soul
Wherefore
they
say
There
are
the
blind
and
the
lame
cannot
come
into
the
house
Samuel
And
David
dwelt

stronghold
and
called
the
city
David
And
David
built
round
about
from
Millo
and
inward
Samuel
And
David
waxed
greater
and

Samuel
And
Hiram
king
Tyre
sent
messengers
David
and
cedar
trees
and
carpenters
and
masons
and
they
built
David
house
Samuel
And
David
perceived
that
Jehovah
had
established
him
king
over
Israel
and
that
had
exalted
his
kingdom
for
his
people
Israel
sake
Samuel
And
David
took
him
more
concubines
and
wives
out

after
was
come
from
Hebron
and
there
were
yet
sons
and
daughters

all
the
Philistines
went
seek
David
and
David
heard
and
went
down
the
stronghold
Samuel
Now
the
Philistines
had
come
and
spread
themselves

valley
Rephaim
Samuel
And
David
inquired
Jehovah
saying
Shall
against
the
Philistines
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
hand
And
Jehovah
said
unto
David
for
will
certainly
deliver
the
Philistines
into
thy
hand
Samuel
And
David
came
Baal
perazim
and
David
smote
them
there
and
said
Jehovah
hath
broken
mine
enemies
before
like
the
breach
waters
Therefore
called
the
name
that
place
Baal
perazim
Samuel
And
they
left
their
images
there
and
David
and
his
men
took
them
away
Samuel
And
the
Philistines
came
yet
again
and
spread
themselves
the
valley
Rephaim
Samuel
And
when
David
inquired
Jehovah
said
Thou
shalt
not
make
circuit
behind
them
and
come
upon
them
over
against
the
mulberry
trees
Samuel
And
shall
when
thou
hearest
the
sound
marching
the
tops
the
mulberry
trees
that
then
thou
shalt
bestir
thyself
for
then
Jehovah
gone
out
before
thee
smite
the
host
the
Philistines
Samuel
And
David
did
Jehovah
commanded
him
and
smote
the
Philistines
from
Geba
until
thou
come
Gezer
Samuel
And
David
again
gathered
together
all
the
chosen
men
Israel
thirty
thousand
Samuel
And
David
arose
and
went
with
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
from
Baale
judah
bring
from
thence
the
ark
God
which
called
the
Name
even
the
name
Jehovah
hosts
that
sitteth
above
the
cherubim
Samuel
And
they
set
the
ark
God
upon
new
cart
and
brought
out
the
house
Abinadab
that
was
the
hill
and
Uzzah
and
Ahio
the

Abinadab
drove

And
they
brought
out
the
house

which
was

and

went
before
the

Samuel
And

and
all
the
house
Israel
played
before
Jehovah
with
all

instruments
made
fir
wood
and
with
harps
and
with
psalteries
and
with
timbrels
and
with
castanets
and
with

Samuel
And
when
they
came

threshing
floor
Nacon
Uzzah
put
forth
his
hand
the
ark
God
and
took
hold
for
the
oxen
stumbled
Samuel
And
the
anger
Jehovah
was
kindled
against
Uzzah
and
God
smote
him
there
for
his
error
and
there
died
the
ark

Samuel
And
David
was
displeased
because
Jehovah
had
broken
forth
upon
Uzzah
and
called
that
place
Perez
uzzah
unto
this
day
Samuel
And
David
was
afraid
Jehovah
that
day
and
said
How
shall
the
ark
Jehovah
come
unto

said
unto

And

And
came

the

night
that
the
word

came
unto

saying
Samuel
and
tell

Thus
saith
Jehovah
Shalt

for

since
the
day
that
brought
the

but
have

spake
word
with
any
the
tribes

saying
Why

Samuel
Now
therefore
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto

David
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
took
thee
from
the
sheepcote
from
following
the
sheep
that
thou
shouldest
prince
over

over
Israel
Samuel
and
have
been
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
wentest
and
have
cut
off
all
thine
enemies
from
before
thee
and
will
make
thee
great
name
like
unto
the
name
the
great
ones
that
are
the
earth
Samuel
And
will
appoint
place
for
people
Israel
and
will
plant
them
that
they
may
dwell
their
own
place
and
moved
more
neither
shall
the
children
wickedness
afflict
them
any
more
the
first
Samuel
and
from
the
day
that
commanded
judges
over
people
Israel
and
will
cause
thee
rest
from
all
thine
enemies
Moreover
Jehovah
telleth
thee
that
Jehovah
will
make
thee
house
Samuel
When
thy
days
are
fulfilled
and
thou
shalt
sleep
with
thy
fathers
will
set
thy
seed
after
thee
that
shall
proceed
out
thy
bowels
and
will
establish
his
kingdom
Samuel
shall
build
house
for
name
and
will
establish
the
throne
his
kingdom
for
ever
Samuel
will
his
father
and
shall
son
commit
iniquity
will
chasten
him
with
the
rod
men
and
with
the
stripes
the
children
men
Samuel
but
lovingkindness
shall
not
depart
from
him
took
from

Samuel
And

house
and
thy

Samuel
According
all
these
words
and
according
all
this
vision
did
Nathan
speak
unto
David
Samuel
Then
David
the
king
went
and
sat
before
Jehovah
and
said
Who
Lord
Jehovah
and
what
house
that
thou
hast
brought
thus
far
Samuel
And
this
was
yet
small
thing

but
thou
hast
spoken
also
thy
servant
house
for
great
while
come
and
this
too
after
the
manner
men
Lord
Jehovah
Samuel
And
what
can
David
say
more
unto
thee
for
thou
knowest
thy

Samuel
For
thy
word
sake
and
according
thine
own
heart
hast
thou
wrought
all
this
greatness
make
thy
servant

Wherefore

And

people
whom
thou
redeemedst
thee
out
Egypt
from

Samuel
And
thou
didst
establish
thyself
thy
people
Israel
people
unto
thee
for
ever
and
thou
Jehovah
becamest
their

Samuel
And

before
thee
Samuel
For

hast
revealed
thy
servant
saying

thee
house
therefore

found
his
heart

this
prayer
unto
thee

And
now

this
good
thing
unto
thy
servant

now
therefore
let
please
thee
bless
the
house
thy

ever
before
thee
for

prospered
Samuel
And

And

and

field
shall
then
into
house
eat
and
drink
and
lie
with
wife
thou
livest
and
thy
soul

this
thing
Samuel
And
David
said
Uriah
Tarry
here
day
also
and
morrow
will
let
thee
depart
Uriah
abode
Jerusalem
that
day
and
the
morrow
Samuel
And
when
David
had
called
him
did
eat
and
drink
before
him
and
made
him
drunk
and
even
went
out
lie
his
bed
with
the
servants
his
lord
but
went
not
down
his
house
Samuel
And
came
pass
the
morning
that
David
wrote
letter
Joab
and
sent
the
hand
Uriah
Samuel
And
wrote
the
letter
saying
Set
Uriah
the
forefront
the
hottest
battle
and
retire
from
him
that
may
smitten
and
die
Samuel
And
came
pass
when
Joab
kept
watch
upon
the
city
that
assigned
Uriah
unto
the
place
where
knew
that
valiant
men
were
Samuel
And
the
men
the
city
went
out
and
fought
with
Joab
and
there
fell
some
the
people
even
the
servants
David
and
Uriah
the
Hittite
died
also
Samuel
Then
Joab
sent
and
told
David
all
the
things
concerning
the
war
Samuel
and
charged
the
messenger
saying
When
thou
hast
made
end
telling
all
the
things
concerning
the
war
unto
the
king
Samuel
shall
that
the
king
wrath
arise
and
say
unto
thee
Wherefore
went
nigh
unto
the
city
fight
knew
not
that
they
would
shoot
from
the
wall
Samuel
who
smote
Abimelech
the
son
Jerubbesheth
did
not
woman
cast
upper
millstone
upon
him
from
the
wall
that
died
Thebez
why
went
nigh
the
wall
then
shalt
thou
say
Thy
servant
Uriah
the
Hittite
dead
also
Samuel
the
messenger
went
and
came
and
showed
David
all
that
Joab
had
sent
him
for
Samuel
And
the
messenger
said
unto
David
The
men
prevailed
against
and
came
out
unto
into
the
field
and
were
upon
them
even
unto
the
entrance
the
gate
Samuel
And
the
shooters
shot
thy
servants
from
off
the
wall
and
some
the
king
servants
are
dead
and
thy
servant
Uriah
the
Hittite
dead
also
Samuel
Then
David
said
unto
the
messenger
Thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
Joab
Let
not
this
thing
displease
thee
for
the
sword
devoureth
one
well
another
make
thy
battle
more
strong
against
the
city
and
overthrow
and
encourage
thou
him
Samuel
And
when
the
wife
Uriah
heard
that
Uriah
her
husband
was
dead
she
made
lamentation
for
her
husband
Samuel
And
when
the
mourning
was
past
David
sent
and
took
her
home
his
house
and
she
became
his
wife
and
bare
him
son
But
the
thing
that
David
had
done
displeased
Jehovah
Samuel
And
Jehovah
sent
Nathan
unto
David
And
came
unto
him
and
said
unto
him
There
were
two
men
one
city
the
one
rich
and
the
other
poor
Samuel
The
rich
man
had
exceeding
many
flocks
and
herds
Samuel
but
the
poor
man
had
nothing
save
one
little
ewe
lamb
which
had
bought
and
nourished
and
grew
together
with
him
and
with
his
children
did
eat
his
own
morsel
and
drank
his
own
cup
and
lay
his
bosom
and
was
unto
him
daughter
Samuel
And
there
came
traveller
unto
the
rich
man
and
spared
take
his
own
flock
and
his
own
herd
dress
for
the
wayfaring
man
that
was
come
unto
him
but
took
the
poor
man
lamb
and
dressed
for
the
man
that
was
come
him
Samuel
And
David
anger
was
greatly
kindled
against
the
man
and
said
Nathan
Jehovah
liveth
the
man
that
hath
done
this
worthy
die
Samuel
and
shall
restore
the
lamb
fourfold
because
did
this
thing
and
because
had
pity
Samuel
And
Nathan
said
David
Thou
art
the
man
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
anointed
thee
king
over
Israel
and
delivered
thee
out
the
hand
Saul
Samuel
and
gave
thee
thy
master
house
and
thy
master
wives
into
thy
bosom
and
gave
thee
the
house
Israel
and
Judah
and
that
had
been
too
little
would
have
added
unto
thee
such
and
such
things
Samuel
Wherefore
hast
thou
despised
the
word
Jehovah
that
which
evil
his
sight
thou
hast
smitten
Uriah
the
Hittite
with
the
sword
and
hast
taken
his
wife
thy
wife
and
hast
slain
him
with
the
sword
the
children
Ammon
Samuel
Now
therefore
the
sword
shall
never
depart
from
thy
house
because
thou
hast
despised
and
hast
taken
the
wife
Uriah
the
Hittite
thy
wife
Samuel
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
will
raise
evil
against
thee
out
thine
own
house
and
will
take
thy
wives
before
thine
eyes
and
give
them
unto
thy
neighbor
and
shall
lie
with
thy
wives
the
sight
this
sun
Samuel
For
thou
didst
secretly
but
will
this
thing
before
all
Israel
and
before
the
sun
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
Nathan
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
And
Nathan
said
unto
David
Jehovah
also
hath
put
away
thy
sin
thou
shalt
not
die
Samuel
Howbeit
because
this
deed
thou
hast
given
great
occasion
the
enemies
Jehovah
blaspheme
the
child
also
that
born
unto
thee
shall
surely
die
Samuel
And
Nathan
departed
unto
his
house
And
Jehovah
struck
the
child
that
Uriah
wife
bare
unto
David
and
was
very
sick
Samuel
David
therefore
besought
God
for
the
child
and
David
fasted
and
went
and
lay
all
night
upon
the
earth
Samuel
And
the
elders
his
house
arose
and
stood
beside
him
raise
him
from
the
earth
but
would
not
neither
did
eat
bread
with
them
Samuel
And
came
pass
the
seventh
day
that
the
child
died
And
the
servants
David
feared
tell
him
that
the
child
was
dead
for
they
said
Behold
while
the
child
was
yet
alive
spake
unto
him
and
hearkened
not
unto
our
voice
how
will
then
vex
himself
tell
him
that
the
child
dead
Samuel
But
when
David
saw
that
his
servants
were
whispering
together
David
perceived
that
the
child
was
dead
and
David
said
unto
his
servants
the
child
dead
And
they
said
dead
Samuel
Then
David
arose
from
the
earth
and
washed
and
anointed
himself
and
changed
his
apparel
and
came
into
the
house
Jehovah
and
worshipped
then
came
his
own
house
and
when
required
they
set
bread
before
him
and
did
eat
Samuel
Then
said
his
servants
unto
him
What
thing
this
that
thou
hast
done
thou
didst
fast
and
weep
for
the
child
while
was
alive
but
when
the
child
was
dead
thou
didst
rise
and
eat
bread
Samuel
And
said
While
the
child
was
yet
alive
fasted
and
wept
for
said
Who
knoweth
whether
Jehovah
will
not
gracious
that
the
child
may
live
Samuel
But
now
dead
wherefore
should
fast
can
bring
him
back
again
shall
him
but
will
not
return
Samuel
And
David
comforted
Bath
sheba
his
wife
and
went
unto
her
and
lay
with
her
and
she
bare
son
and
called
his
name
Solomon
And
Jehovah
loved
him
Samuel
and
sent
the
hand
Nathan
the
prophet
and
called
his
name
Jedidiah
for
Jehovah
sake
Samuel
Now
Joab
fought
against
Rabbah
the
children
Ammon
and
took
the
royal
city
Samuel
And
Joab
sent
messengers
David
and
said
have
fought
against
Rabbah
yea
have
taken
the
city
waters
Samuel
Now
therefore
gather
the
rest
the
people
together
and
encamp
against
the
city
and
take
lest
take
the
city
and
called
after
name
Samuel
And
David
gathered
all
the
people
together
and
went
Rabbah
and
fought
against
and
took
Samuel
And
took
the
crown
their
king
from
off
his
head
and
the
weight
thereof
was
talent
gold
and
were
precious
stones
and
was
set
David
head
And
brought
forth
the
spoil
the
city
exceeding
much
Samuel
And
brought
forth
the
people
that
were
therein
and
put
them
under
saws
and
under
harrows
iron
and
under
axes
iron
and
made
them
pass
through
the
brickkiln
and
thus
did
unto
all
the
cities
the
children
Ammon
And
David
and
all
the
people
returned
unto
Jerusalem
Samuel
And
came
pass
after
this
that
Absalom
the
son
David
had
fair
sister
whose
name
was
Tamar
and
Amnon
the
son
David
loved
her
Samuel
And
Amnon
was
vexed
that
fell
sick
because
his
sister
Tamar
for
she
was
virgin
and
seemed
hard
Amnon
anything
unto
her
Samuel
But
Amnon
had
friend
whose
name
was
Jonadab
the
son
Shimeah
David
brother
and
Jonadab
was
very
subtle
man
Samuel
And
said
unto
him
Why
son
the
king
art
thou
thus
lean
from
day
day
wilt
thou
not
tell
And
Amnon
said
unto
him
love
Tamar
brother
Absalom
sister
Samuel
And
Jonadab
said
unto
him
Lay
thee
down
thy
bed
and
feign
thyself
sick
and
when
thy
father
cometh
see
thee
say
unto
him
Let
sister
Tamar
come
pray
thee
and
give
bread
eat
and
dress
the
food
sight
that
may
see
and
eat
from
her
hand
Samuel
Amnon
lay
down
and
feigned
himself
sick
and
when
the
king
was
come
see
him
Amnon
said
unto
the
king
Let
sister
Tamar
come
pray
thee
and
make
couple
cakes
sight
that
may
eat
from
her
hand
Samuel
Then
David
sent
home
Tamar
saying
now
thy
brother
Amnon
house
and
dress
him
food
Samuel
Tamar
went
her
brother
Amnon
house
and
was
laid
down
And
she
took
dough
and
kneaded
and
made
cakes
his
sight
and
did
bake
the
cakes
Samuel
And
she
took
the
pan
and
poured
them
out
before
him
but
refused
eat
And
Amnon
said
Have
out
all
men
from
And
they
went
out
every
man
from
him
Samuel
And
Amnon
said
unto
Tamar
Bring
the
food
into
the
chamber
that
may
eat
from
thy
hand
And
Tamar
took
the
cakes
which
she
had
made
and
brought
them
into
the
chamber
Amnon
her
brother
Samuel
And
when
she
had
brought
them
near
unto
him
eat
took
hold
her
and
said
unto
her
Come
lie
with
sister
Samuel
And
she
answered
him
Nay
brother
not
force
for
such
thing
ought
done
Israel
not
thou
this
folly
Samuel
And
whither
shall
carry
shame
and
for
thee
thou
wilt
one
the
fools
Israel
Now
therefore
pray
thee
speak
unto
the
king
for
will
not
withhold
from
thee
Samuel
Howbeit
would
not
hearken
unto
her
voice
but
being
stronger
than
she
forced
her
and
lay
with
her
Samuel
Then
Amnon
hated
her
with
exceeding
great
hatred
for
the
hatred
wherewith
hated
her
was
greater
than
the
love
wherewith
had
loved
her
And
Amnon
said
unto
her
Arise
gone
Samuel
And
she
said
unto
him
Not
because
this
great
wrong
putting
forth
worse
than
the
other
that
thou
didst
unto
But
would
not
hearken
unto
her
Samuel
Then
called
his
servant
that
ministered
unto
him
and
said
Put
now
this
woman
out
from
and
bolt
the
door
after
her
Samuel
And
she
had
garment
divers
colors
upon
her
for
with
such
robes
were
the
king
daughters
that
were
virgins
apparelled
Then
his
servant
brought
her
out
and
bolted
the
door
after
her
Samuel
And
Tamar
put
ashes
her
head
and
rent
her
garment
divers
colors
that
was
her
and
she
laid
her
hand
her
head
and
went
her
way
crying
aloud
she
went
Samuel
And
Absalom
her
brother
said
unto
her
Hath
Amnon
thy
brother
been
with
thee
but
now
hold
thy
peace
sister
thy
brother
take
not
this
thing
heart
Tamar
remained
desolate
her
brother
Absalom
house
Samuel
But
when
king
David
heard
all
these
things
was
very
wroth
Samuel
And
Absalom
spake
unto
Amnon
neither
good
nor
bad
for
Absalom
hated
Amnon
because
had
forced
his
sister
Tamar
Samuel
And
came
pass
after
two
full
years
that
Absalom
had
sheep
shearers
Baal
hazor
which
beside
Ephraim
and
Absalom
invited
all
the
king
sons
Samuel
And
Absalom
came
the
king
and
said
Behold
now
thy
servant
hath
sheep
shearers
let
the
king
pray
thee
and
his
servants
with
thy
servant
Samuel
And
the
king
said
Absalom
Nay
son
let
not
all
lest
burdensome
unto
thee
And
pressed
him
howbeit
would
not
but
blessed
him
Samuel
Then
said
Absalom
not
pray
thee
let
brother
Amnon
with
And
the
king
said
unto
him
Why
should
with
thee
Samuel
But
Absalom
pressed
him
and
let
Amnon
and
all
the
king
sons
with
him
Samuel
And
Absalom
commanded
his
servants
saying
Mark
now
when
Amnon
heart
merry
with
wine
and
when
say
unto
you
Smite
Amnon
then
kill
him
fear
not
have
not
commanded
you
courageous
and
valiant
Samuel
And
the
servants
Absalom
did
unto
Amnon
Absalom
had
commanded
Then
all
the
king
sons
arose
and
every
man
gat
him
upon
his
mule
and
fled
Samuel
And
came
pass
while
they
were
the
way
that
the
tidings
came
David
saying
Absalom
hath
slain
all
the
king
sons
and
there
not
one
them
left
Samuel
Then
the
king
arose
and
rent
his
garments
and
lay
the
earth
and
all
his
servants
stood
with
their
clothes
rent
Samuel
And
Jonadab
the
son
Shimeah
David
brother
answered
and
said
Let
not
lord
suppose
that
they
have
killed
all
the
young
men
the
king
sons
for
Amnon
only
dead
for
the
appointment
Absalom
this
hath
been
determined
from
the
day
that
forced
his
sister
Tamar
Samuel
Now
therefore
let
not
lord
the
king
take
the
thing
his
heart
think
that
all
the
king
sons
are
dead
for
Amnon
only
dead
Samuel
But
Absalom
fled
And
the
young
man
that
kept
the
watch
lifted
his
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
there
came
much
people
the
way
the
hill
side
behind
him
Samuel
And
Jonadab
said
unto
the
king
Behold
the
king
sons
are
come
thy
servant
said
Samuel
And
came
pass
soon
had
made
end
speaking
that
behold
the
king
sons
came
and
lifted
their
voice
and
wept
and
the
king
also
and
all
his
servants
wept
very
sore
Samuel
But
Absalom
fled
and
went
Talmai
the
son
Ammihur
king
Geshur
And
David
mourned
for
his
son
every
day
Samuel
Absalom
fled
and
went
Geshur
and
was
there
three
years
Samuel
And
the
soul
king
David
longed
forth
unto
Absalom
for
was
comforted
concerning
Amnon
seeing
was
dead
Samuel
Now
Joab
the
son
Zeruiah
perceived
that
the
king
heart
was
toward
Absalom
Samuel
And
Joab
sent
Tekoa
and
fetched
thence
wise
woman
and
said
unto
her
pray
thee
feign
thyself
mourner
and
put
mourning
apparel
pray
thee
and
anoint
not
thyself
with
oil
but
woman
that
hath
long
time
mourned
for
the
dead
Samuel
and
the
king
and
speak
this
manner
unto
him
Joab
put
the
words
her
mouth
Samuel
And
when
the
woman
Tekoa
spake
the
king
she
fell
her
face
the
ground
and
did
obeisance
and
said
Help
king
Samuel
And
the
king
said
unto
her
What
aileth
thee
And
she
answered
truth
widow
and
husband
dead
Samuel
And
thy
handmaid
had
two
sons
and
they
two
strove
together
the
field
and
there
was
none
part
them
but
the
one
smote
the
other
and
killed
him
Samuel
And
behold
the
whole
family
risen
against
thy
handmaid
and
they
say
Deliver
him
that
smote
his
brother
that
may
kill
him
for
the
life
his
brother
whom
slew
and
destroy
the
heir
also
Thus
will
they
quench
coal
which
left
and
will
leave
husband
neither
name
nor
remainder
upon
the
face
the
earth
Samuel
And
the
king
said
unto
the
woman
thy
house
and
will
give
charge
concerning
thee
Samuel
And
the
woman
Tekoa
said
unto
the
king
lord
king
the
iniquity
and
father
house
and
the
king
and
his
throne
guiltless
Samuel
And
the
king
said
Whosoever
saith
aught
unto
thee
bring
him
and
shall
not
touch
thee
any
more
Samuel
Then
said
she
pray
thee
let
the
king
remember
Jehovah
thy
God
that
the
avenger
blood
destroy
not
any
more
lest
they
destroy
son
And
said
Jehovah
liveth
there
shall
not
one
hair
thy
son
fall
the
earth
Samuel
Then
the
woman
said
Let
thy
handmaid
pray
thee
speak
word
unto
lord
the
king
And
said
Say
Samuel
And
the
woman
said
Wherefore
then
hast
thou
devised
such
thing
against
the
people
God
for
speaking
this
word
the
king
one
that
guilty
that
the
king
doth
not
fetch
home

Samuel
And
Joab

and
brought

Samuel
And
the

said
Let

but
let

Absalom
turned
his
own
house
and
saw
not
the

Samuel
Now
all
Israel
there
was
none
much
praised
Absalom
for
his
beauty
from
the
sole
his
foot
even

Samuel
And
when

now
was

therefore

weighed

And
unto

there
were

And

Then
Absalom
sent

but
would
not
come

and

and
set

And
Absalom
servants
set

Samuel
Then
Joab
arose
and
came
Absalom
unto
his
house
and
said
unto
him
Wherefore

thy
servants
set

Samuel
And

Samuel
Joab
came
the
king
and
told
him
and
when
had
called
for
Absalom
came
the
king
and
bowed
himself
his
face

ground
before
the
king
and
the
king
kissed
Absalom
Samuel
And
came
pass
after
this
that
Absalom
prepared
him

horses
and
fifty
men
run
before
him
Samuel
And
Absalom
rose
early
and
stood
beside
the
way

gate
and
was
that
when
any
man
had
suit
which
should
come
the
king
for
judgment
then
Absalom
called
unto
him
and
said
what
city
art
thou
And
said
Thy

one
the
tribes
Israel
Samuel
And
Absalom
said
unto
him

and
kissed

Samuel
And

manner
did
Absalom
all
Israel
that
came
the
king
for

Absalom
stole
the
hearts
the
men
Israel
Samuel
And

Samuel
And
the

said
unto
him

and
went

Samuel
But
Absalom
sent
spies
throughout
all
the
tribes
Israel
saying

And
with
Absalom
went
two
hundred
men
out

that
were
invited
and
went

And

sent
for
Ahithophel

from
Giloh
while

And

increased
continually
with
Absalom
Samuel
And
there
came

saying
The

Samuel
And
David
said
unto

Samuel
And
the
king
servants
said
unto
the
king

Samuel
And

And
Absalom
said
Hushai
this

Samuel
And
Hushai
said
unto

Nay
but

and
all
the
men
Israel
have
chosen
his
will
and
with

And

Then
said
Absalom
Ahithophel
Give

Samuel
And
Ahithophel
said
unto
Absalom
unto
thy
father
concubines
that
hath
left
keep
the
house
and
all
Israel
will
hear
that
thou
art
abhorred
thy

then
will
the
hands
all
that
are
with
thee
strong
Samuel
they
spread
Absalom
tent
upon
the
top
the
house
and
Absalom
went
unto
his

all
Israel
Samuel
And

those
days
was

inquired
the
oracle
God
was
all
the
counsel
Ahithophel
both
with
David
and
with
Absalom
Samuel
Moreover
Ahithophel
said
unto
Absalom
Let

choose
out
twelve
thousand
men
and
will
arise
and
pursue
after
David
this
night
Samuel
and
will
come
upon
him
while
weary
and
weak
handed
and
will
make
him
afraid
and
all
the
people
that
are
with
him
shall
flee
and
will
smite
the
king
only
Samuel
and
will
bring
back
all
the
people
unto
thee
the
man
whom
thou
seekest
all
returned
all
the
people
shall
peace
Samuel
And
the
saying
pleased
Absalom
well
and
all
the
elders
Israel
Samuel
Then
said
Absalom
Call

Hushai
the
Archite
also
and
let
hear
likewise
what
saith
Samuel
And
when
Hushai
was
come
Absalom
Absalom
spake
unto
him
saying
Ahithophel
hath
spoken
after
this
manner
shall
after
his
saying
not
speak
thou
Samuel
And
Hushai
said
unto
Absalom
The
counsel
that
Ahithophel
hath
given
this
time
not
good
Samuel
Hushai
said
moreover
Thou
knowest
thy
father
and
his
men
that
they
are
mighty
men
and
they
are
chafed
their
minds
bear
robbed
her
whelps
the
field
and
thy
father
man
war
and
will
not
lodge
with
the
people
Samuel
Behold
hid
now
some
pit
some
other
place
and
will
come
pass
when
some
them
are
fallen
the
first
that
whosoever
heareth
will
say
There
slaughter
among
the
people
that
follow
Absalom
Samuel
And
even
that
valiant
whose
heart
the
heart
lion
will
utterly
melt
for
all
Israel
knoweth
that
thy
father
mighty
man
and
they
that
are
with
him
are
valiant
men
Samuel
But
counsel
that
all
Israel
gathered
together
unto
thee
from
Dan
even
Beer

the
sand
that
the
sea
for
multitude
and
that
thou

Samuel
shall
come
upon
him
some
place
where

found
and
will
light
upon
him
the
dew
falleth
the
ground
and
him
and
all
the
men
that
are
with
him
will
not
leave
much
one
Samuel
Moreover
gotten
into
city
then
shall
all
Israel
bring
ropes
that
city
and
will
draw
into
the
river
until
there
not
one
small
stone
found
there
Samuel
And
Absalom
and
all
the
men
Israel
said
The
counsel
Hushai
the
Archite
better
than
the
counsel
Ahithophel
For
Jehovah
had
ordained
defeat
the
good
counsel
Ahithophel
the
intent
that
Jehovah
might
bring
evil
upon
Absalom
Samuel
Then
said
Hushai
unto
Zadok
and
Abiathar
the
priests
Thus
and
thus
did
Ahithophel
counsel
Absalom
and
the
elders
Israel
and
thus
and
thus
have
counselled
Samuel
Now
therefore
send
quickly
and
tell
David
saying
Lodge

but
all

Now
Jonathan

them
and
they
went
and
told
king
David
for
they
might
not
seen
come
into
the
city
Samuel
But
lad
saw
them
and
told
Absalom
and
they
went
both
them
away
quickly
and
came
the
house
man
Bahurim
who
had
well
his

and
they
went
down
thither
Samuel
And
the
woman
took
and
spread
the

and
strewed
bruised

and
nothing
was
known
Samuel
And
Absalom

and
they
said
Where

Ahimaaz
and
Jonathan
And
the
woman
said
unto
them
They
are
gone
over

And
when
they
had
sought
and
could
not
find
them
they
returned

Samuel
And
came
pass
after
they
were
departed
that
they
came
out

well
and
went
and
told
king

and
they
said
unto
David
Arise
and
pass
quickly
over
the
water
for
thus
hath
Ahithophel
counselled
against
you
Samuel
Then
David
arose
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
and
they
passed
over
the
Jordan
the
morning
light
there
lacked
not
one
them
that
was
not
gone
over
the
Jordan
Samuel
And
when
Ahithophel
saw
that
his
counsel
was
not
followed
saddled
his
ass
and
arose
and
gat
him
home
unto
his
city
and
set
his
house
order
and
hanged
himself
and
died
and
was
buried

sepulchre

father
Samuel
Then
David
came
Mahanaim
And
Absalom
passed
over
the
Jordan
and
all
the
men
Israel
with
him
Samuel
And
Absalom
set

Now

And

And
came

when

said
The

and
thirsty
the
wilderness
Samuel
And
David
numbered
the
people
that
were
with
him
and
set
captains
thousands
and
captains
hundreds
over
them
Samuel
And
David
sent
forth
the
people
third
part
under
the
hand
Joab
and
third
part
under
the
hand
Abishai
the
son
Zeruiah
Joab
brother
and
third
part
under
the
hand
Ittai
the
Gittite
And
the
king
said
unto
the
people
will
surely
forth
with
you
myself
also
Samuel
But
the
people
said
Thou
shalt
not
forth
for
flee
away
they
will
not
care
for
neither
half
die
will
they
care
for
but
thou
art
worth
ten
thousand
therefore
now
better
that
thou
ready
succor
out
the
city
Samuel
And
the
king
said
unto
them
What
seemeth
you
best
will
And
the
king
stood
the
gate
side
and
all
the
people
went
out
hundreds
and
thousands
Samuel
And
the
king
commanded
Joab
and
Abishai
and
Ittai
saying
Deal
gently
for
sake
with
the
young
man
even
with
Absalom
And
all
the
people
heard
when
the
king
gave
all
the
captains
charge
concerning
Absalom
Samuel
the
people
went
out
into
the
field
against
Israel
and
the
battle
was
the
forest
Ephraim
Samuel
And
the
people
Israel
were
smitten
there
before
the
servants
David
and
there
was
great
slaughter
there
that
day
twenty
thousand
men
Samuel
For
the
battle
was
there
spread
over
the
face
all
the
country
and
the
forest
devoured
more
people
that
day
than
the
sword
devoured
Samuel
And
Absalom
chanced
meet
the
servants
David
And
Absalom
was
riding
upon
his
mule
and
the
mule
went
under
the
thick
boughs
great
oak
and
his
head
caught
hold
the
oak
and
was
taken
between
heaven
and
earth
and
the
mule
that
was
under
him
went
Samuel
And
certain
man
saw
and
told
Joab
and
said
Behold
saw
Absalom
hanging
oak
Samuel
And
Joab
said
unto
the
man
that
told
him
And
behold
thou
sawest
and
why
didst
thou
not
smite
him
there
the
ground
and
would
have
given
thee
ten
pieces
silver
and
girdle
Samuel
And
the
man
said
unto
Joab
Though
should
receive
thousand
pieces
silver
hand
yet
would
not
put
forth
hand
against
the
king
son
for
our
hearing
the
king
charged
thee
and
Abishai
and
Ittai
saying
Beware
that
none
touch
the
young
man
Absalom
Samuel
Otherwise
had
dealt
falsely
against
his
life
and
there
matter
hid
from
the
king
then
thou
thyself
wouldest
have
set
thyself
against
Samuel
Then
said
Joab
may
not
tarry
thus
with
thee
And
took
three
darts
his
hand
and
thrust
them
through
the
heart
Absalom
while
was
yet
alive
the
midst
the
oak
Samuel
And
ten
young
men
that
bare
Joab
armor
compassed
about
and
smote
Absalom
and
slew
him
Samuel
And
Joab
blew
the
trumpet
and
the
people
returned
from
pursuing
after
Israel
for
Joab
held
back
the
people
Samuel
And
they
took
Absalom
and
cast
him
into
the
great
pit
the
forest
and
raised
over
him
very
great
heap
stones
and
all
Israel
fled
every
one
his
tent
Samuel
Now
Absalom
his
lifetime
had
taken
and
reared
for
himself
the
pillar
which
the
king
dale
for
said
have
son
keep
name
remembrance
and
called
the
pillar
after
his
own
name
and
called
Absalom
monument
unto
this
day
Samuel
Then
said
Ahimaaz
the
son
Zadok
Let
now
run
and
bear
the
king
tidings
how
that
Jehovah
hath
avenged
him
his
enemies
Samuel
And
Joab
said
unto
him
Thou
shalt

bearer
tidings
this
day
but
thou
shalt
bear
tidings
another
day
but
this
day
thou
shalt
bear
tidings
because
the
king
son

Samuel
Then
said
Joab
the
Cushite
tell
the
king
what
thou
hast
seen
And
the
Cushite
bowed
himself
unto
Joab
and
ran
Samuel
Then
said
Ahimaaz
the
son
Zadok
yet
again
Joab
But
come
what
may
let
pray
thee
also
run
after
the
Cushite
And
Joab
said
Wherefore
wilt
thou
run
son
seeing
that
thou
wilt
have
reward
for
the
tidings
Samuel
But
come
what
may
said
will
run
And
said
unto
him
Run
Then
Ahimaaz
ran
the
way
the
Plain
and
outran
the
Cushite
Samuel
Now
David
was
sitting
between
the
two
gates
and
the
watchman
went

roof
the
gate
unto
the
wall
and
lifted
his
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
man
running
alone
Samuel
And
the
watchman
cried
and
told
the
king
And
the
king
said
alone
there
tidings

mouth
And
came
apace
and
drew
near
Samuel
And
the
watchman
saw
another
man
running
and
the
watchman
called
unto
the
porter
and
said
Behold
another
man
running
alone
And
the
king
said
also
bringeth
tidings
Samuel
And
the
watchman
said
think
the
running
the
foremost
like
the
running
Ahimaaz
the
son
Zadok
And
the
king
said
good
man
and
cometh
with
good
tidings
Samuel
And
Ahimaaz
called
and
said
unto
the
king
All
well
And
bowed
himself
before
the
king
with
his
face
the
earth
and
said
Blessed
Jehovah
thy
God
who
hath
delivered
the
men
that
lifted
their
hand
against
lord
the
king
Samuel
And
the
king
said
well
with
the
young
man
Absalom
And
Ahimaaz
answered
When
Joab
sent
the
king
servant
even
thy
servant
saw
great
tumult
but
knew
not
what
was
Samuel
And
the
king
said
Turn
aside
and
stand
here
And
turned
aside
and
stood
still
Samuel
And
behold
the
Cushite
came
and
the
Cushite
said
Tidings
for
lord
the
king
for
Jehovah
hath
avenged
thee
this
day
all
them
that
rose
against
thee
Samuel
And
the
king
said
unto
the
Cushite
well
with
the
young
man
Absalom
And
the
Cushite
answered
The
enemies
lord
the
king
and
all
that
rise
against
thee
thee
hurt
that
young
man
Samuel
And
the
king
was
much
moved
and
went
the
chamber
over
the
gate
and
wept
and
went
thus
said
son
Absalom
son
son
Absalom
would
had
died
for
thee
Absalom
son
son
Samuel
And
was
told
Joab
Behold
the
king
weepeth
and
mourneth
for
Absalom
Samuel
And
the
victory
that
day
was
turned
into
mourning
unto
all
the
people
for
the
people
heard
say
that
day
The
king
grieveth
for
his
son
Samuel
And
the
people
gat
them
stealth
that
day
into
the
city
people
that
are
ashamed
steal
away
when
they
flee
battle
Samuel
And
the
king
covered
his
face
and
the
king
cried
with
loud
voice
son
Absalom
Absalom
son
son
Samuel
And
Joab
came
into
the
house
the
king
and
said
Thou
hast
shamed
this
day
the
faces
all
thy
servants
who
this
day
have
saved
thy
life
and
the
lives
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
and
the
lives
thy
wives
and
the
lives
thy
concubines
Samuel
that
thou
lovest
them
that
hate
thee
and
hatest
them
that
love
thee
For
thou
hast
declared
this
day
that
princes
and
servants
are
nought
unto
thee
for
this
day
perceive
that
Absalom
had
lived
and
all
had
died
this
day
then
had
pleased
thee
well
Samuel
Now
therefore
arise
forth
and
speak
comfortably
unto
thy
servants
for
swear
Jehovah
thou
not
forth
there
will
not
tarry
man
with
thee
this
night
and
that
will
worse
unto
thee
than
all
the
evil
that
hath
befallen
thee
from
thy
youth
until
now
Samuel
Then
the
king
arose
and
sat
the
gate
And
they
told
unto
all
the
people
saying
Behold
the
king
sitting
the
gate
and
all
the
people
came
before
the
king
Now
Israel
had
fled
every
man

tent
Samuel
And
all
the
people
were
strife
throughout
all
the
tribes
Israel
saying
The
king
delivered
out
the
hand
our
enemies
and
saved
out
the
hand
the
Philistines
and
now
fled
out
the
land
from
Absalom
Samuel
And
Absalom
whom
anointed
over
dead
battle
Now
therefore
why

the
king

Samuel
And
king
David
sent
Zadok
and
Abiathar
the
priests
saying
Speak
unto
the
elders
Judah
saying
Why

the
king
back
his
house
seeing
the
speech
all
Israel

wherefore

Samuel
And
say
Amasa
Art
thou
not

and
flesh
God
and
more
also
thou

the
host
before
continually
the
room
Joab
Samuel
And
bowed
the
heart
all
the
men
Judah
even
the
heart
one
man
that
they
sent
unto
the
king
saying
Return
thou
and

And
Judah

and
his

sons
and
his

and

Samuel
And
there
went
over

And
Shimei
the
son
Gera
fell
down
before
the
king
when
was
come
over
the
Jordan
Samuel
And
said
unto
the
king
Let
not
lord
impute
iniquity
unto
neither
thou
remember
that
which
thy
servant
did
perversely
the
day
that
lord
the
king
went
out
Jerusalem
that
the
king
should
take
his
heart
Samuel
For
thy
servant
doth
know
that
have
sinned
therefore
behold
come
this
day
the
first
all
the
house
Joseph
down
meet
lord
the
king
Samuel
But
Abishai
the
son
Zeruiah
answered
and
said
Shall
not
Shimei
put
death
for
this
because
cursed
Jehovah
anointed
Samuel
And
David
said
What
have
with
you
sons
Zeruiah
that
should
this
day
adversaries
unto
shall
there
any
man
put
death
this
day
Israel
for
not
know
that
this
day
king
over
Israel
Samuel
And
the
king
said
unto
Shimei
Thou
shalt
not
die
And
the
king
sware
unto
him
Samuel
And
Mephibosheth
the
son
Saul
came
down
meet
the
king
and
had
neither
dressed
his
feet
nor
trimmed
his
beard
nor
washed
his
clothes
from
the
day
the
king
departed
until
the
day
came
home
peace
Samuel
And
came
pass
when
was
come
Jerusalem
meet
the
king
that
the
king
said
unto
him
Wherefore
wentest
not
thou
with
Mephibosheth
Samuel
And
answered
lord
king
servant
deceived
for
thy
servant
said
will
saddle
ass
that
may
ride
thereon
and
with
the
king
because
thy
servant
lame
Samuel
And
hath
slandered
thy
servant
unto
lord
the
king
but
lord
the
king
angel
God
therefore
what
good
thine
eyes
Samuel
For
all
father
house
were
but
dead
men
before
lord
the
king
yet
didst
thou
set
thy
servant
among
them
that
did
eat
thine
own
table
What
right
therefore
have
yet
that
should
cry
any
more
unto
the
king
Samuel
And
the
king
said
unto
him
Why
speakest
thou
any
more
thy
matters
say
Thou
and
Ziba
divide
the
land
Samuel
And
Mephibosheth
said
unto
the
king
yea
let
him
take
all
forasmuch
lord
the
king
come
peace
unto
his
own
house
Samuel
And
Barzillai
the
Gileadite
came
down
from
Rogelim
and
went
over
the
Jordan
with
the
king
conduct
him
over
the
Jordan
Samuel
Now
Barzillai
was
very
aged
man
even
fourscore
years
old
and
had
provided
the
king
with
sustenance
while
lay
Mahanaim
for
was
very
great
man
Samuel
And
the
king
said
unto
Barzillai
Come
thou
over
with
and
will
sustain
thee
with
Jerusalem
Samuel
And
Barzillai
said
unto
the
king
How
many
are
the
days
the
years
life
that
should
with
the
king
unto
Jerusalem
Samuel
this
day
fourscore
years
old
can
discern
between
good
and
bad
can
thy
servant
taste
what
eat
what
drink
can
hear
any
more
the
voice
singing
men
and
singing
women
wherefore
then
should
thy
servant
yet
burden
unto
lord
the
king
Samuel
Thy
servant
would
but
just
over
the
Jordan
with
the
king
and
why
should
the
king
recompense
with
such
reward
Samuel
Let
thy
servant
pray
thee
turn
back
again
that
may
die
mine
own
city
the
grave
father
and
mother
But
behold
thy
servant
Chimham
let
him
over
with
lord
the
king
and
him
what
shall
seem
good
unto
thee
Samuel
And
the
king
answered
Chimham
shall
over
with
and
will
him
that
which
shall
seem
good
unto
thee
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
require
that
will
for
thee
Samuel
And
all
the
people
went
over
the
Jordan
and
the
king
went
over
and
the
king
kissed
Barzillai
and
blessed
him
and
returned
unto
his
own
place
Samuel
the
king
went
over
Gilgal
and
Chimham
went
over
with
him
and
all
the
people
Judah
brought
the
king
over
and
also
half
the
people
Israel
Samuel
And
behold
all
the
men
Israel
came
the
king
and
said
unto
the
king
Why
have
our
brethren
the
men
Judah
stolen
thee
away
and
brought
the
king
and
his
household
over
the
Jordan
and
all
David
men
with
him
Samuel
And
all
the
men
Judah
answered
the
men
Israel
Because
the
king
near
kin
wherefore
then
are
angry
for
this
matter
have
eaten
all
the
king
cost
hath
given
any
gift
Samuel
And
the
men
Israel
answered
the
men
Judah
and
said
have
ten
parts
the
king
and
have
also
more
right
David
than
why
then
did
despise
that
our
advice
should
not
first
had
bringing
back
our
king
And
the
words
the
men
Judah
were
fiercer
than
the
words
the
men
Israel
Samuel
And
there
happened
there
base
fellow
whose
name
was
Sheba
the
son
Bichri
Benjamite
and
blew
the
trumpet
and
said
have

David
neither
have
inheritance
the
son
Jesse
every
man

tents
Israel
Samuel
all
the
men
Israel
went
from
following
David
and
followed
Sheba
the
son
Bichri
but
the
men
Judah
clave
unto
their
king
from
the
Jordan
even
Jerusalem
Samuel
And
David
came

house
Jerusalem
and
the
king
took
the
ten
women
his
concubines
whom
had
left
keep
the
house
and
put
them

and
provided
them
with
sustenance
but
went
not
unto
them
they
were

And
David
said
Abishai
Now

take

him
lest

And

When

And

And
Joab
took

Samuel
But
Amasa
took
heed

And

And

And
Amasa
lay
wallowing

And
when
the

saw
that
all
the

stood
still
carried
Amasa
out

and
cast

when

When

And

And

Then

Samuel
And

Then
she
said
unto

The

And
the

said
unto

Samuel
Then
the
woman
went
unto
all
the

wisdom
And
they
cut
off
the

Bichri
and
threw

And

and
they
were

And

Now

And

And

David
sware
unto

Jaareoregim
the
Beth
lehemite
slew

And

These

Samuel
And
David
spake
unto
Jehovah
the
words
this
song
the
day
that
Jehovah
delivered
him
out
the
hand
all
his
enemies
and
out

Samuel
For
the

The

Samuel
The

about
The

came
upon
Samuel
distress
called
upon
Jehovah
Yea
called
unto
God
And
heard
voice
out
his
temple
And
cry
came
into
his
ears
Samuel
Then
the
earth
shook
and
trembled
The
foundations
heaven
quaked
And
were
shaken
because
was
wroth
Samuel
There
went
smoke
out
his
nostrils
And
fire
out
his
mouth
devoured
Coals
were
kindled
Samuel
bowed
the
heavens
also
and
came
down
And
thick
darkness
was
under
his
feet
Samuel
And
rode
upon
cherub
and
did
fly
Yea
was
seen
upon
the
wings
the
wind
Samuel
And
made
darkness
pavilions
round
about
him
Gathering

Samuel
the

Coals

were
kindled
Samuel
Jehovah
thundered
from

And
the
Most
High
uttered
his
voice
Samuel
And
sent
out
arrows
and
scattered
them
Lightning
and
discomfited
them
Samuel
Then
the

appeared
The
foundations

world
were
laid
bare
the

Jehovah
the
blast

From

They

But

For

And

wickedly
departed

God
Samuel
For
all
his
ordinances
were
before
And
for
his
statutes
did
not
depart
from
them
Samuel
was
also
perfect
toward
him
And
kept
myself
from
mine
iniquity
Samuel
Therefore
hath
Jehovah
recompensed
according

According

Samuel
With

With

And
with

Samuel
And
the

But
thine

are
upon
the

thou
mayest
bring
them

Samuel
For

And

Samuel
For

were
consumed
Samuel
And
have
consumed
them
and
smitten
them
through
that
they
cannot
arise
Yea
they
are
fallen
under
feet
Samuel
For
thou
hast
girded
with
strength
unto
the
battle
Thou
hast
subdued
under
those

rose
against
Samuel
Thou
hast
also
made
mine
enemies

That

cut
off
them
that

Samuel
They
looked
but
there
was
none

Even
unto
Jehovah
but
answered
them
not
Samuel
Then
did
beat
them
small
the
dust
the
earth
did
crush
them
the
mire
the
streets
and
did
spread
them
abroad
Samuel
Thou

hast
delivered

The

The
foreigners
shall
fade
away
And
shall
come
trembling
out
their
close

Samuel
Jehovah

And
exalted

Even
the
God
that
executeth
vengeance
for
And
that
bringeth

under
Samuel
And
that
bringeth
forth
from
mine
enemies
Yea
thou
liftest
above
them
that
rise
against
Thou
deliverest
from
the
violent
man
Samuel
Therefore
will
give
thanks
unto
thee
Jehovah
among
the
nations
And
will
sing
praises
unto
thy
name
Samuel
Great
deliverance
giveth
his
king
And
showeth
lovingkindness
his
anointed
David
and
his
seed
for
evermore
Samuel
Now
these
are
the
last
words
David
David
the
son
Jesse
saith
And
the
man
who
was
raised
high
saith
The
anointed
the

Jacob
And

Israel
Samuel
The

And
his

was
upon

Samuel
The

Israel
said
The

Israel
spake
One
that
ruleth
over
men
righteously
That

Samuel
shall
the
light
the
morning
when
the
sun
riseth
morning
without
clouds
When
the
tender
grass
springeth
out
the
earth
Through
clear
shining
after

Samuel
Verily
house
not
with
God
Yet
hath
made
with
everlasting
covenant
Ordered
all
things
and
sure
For
all
salvation
and
all
desire
Although
maketh
not
grow
Samuel
But
the
ungodly
shall
all
them
thorns
thrust
away
Because
they
cannot
taken
with
the
hand
Samuel
But
the
man
that
toucheth
them
Must
armed
with
iron
and
the
staff
spear
And
they
shall
utterly
burned
with
fire
their

Samuel
These
are
the

and
the

were
gone
away
Samuel
arose
and
smote
the
Philistines
until
his
hand
was
weary
and
his
hand
clave
unto
the
sword
and
Jehovah
wrought
great
victory
that
day
and
the
people
returned
after
him
only
take
spoil
Samuel
And
after
him
was
Shammah
the
son
Agee
Hararite
And
the
Philistines
were
gathered
together
into
troop
where
was
plot
ground
full
lentils
and
the
people
fled
from
the
Philistines
Samuel
But
stood

midst
the
plot
and
defended
and
slew
the
Philistines
and
Jehovah
wrought

And

Samuel
And
David
longed
and
said
that

And
the
three
mighty
men
brake
through
the

the
Philistines
and
drew
water
out

well
Beth
lehem
that
was
the
gate
and
took
and
brought
David
but
would
not
drink
thereof
but
poured
out
unto
Jehovah
Samuel
And
said
far
from
Jehovah
that
should
this
shall
drink
the
blood
the
men
that
went
jeopardy
their
lives
therefore
would
not
drink
These
things
did
the
three
mighty
men
Samuel
And
Abishai
the
brother
Joab
the
son
Zeruiah
was
chief
the
three
And
lifted
his
spear
against
three
hundred
and
slew
them
and
had
name
among
the
three
Samuel
Was
not
most
honorable
the

therefore
was
made
their

Samuel
These

Benaiah
the

And
again
the
anger
Jehovah
was
kindled
against
Israel
and
moved
David
against
them
saying
number
Israel
and
Judah
Samuel
And
the
king
said
Joab
the

who
was
with

now
and
fro
through
all
the
tribes
Israel
from

even
Beer

and
number

that

And
Joab
said
unto
the
king
Now
Jehovah
thy
God
add
unto
the
people
how
many
soever
they
may
hundredfold
and
may
the
eyes
lord

see
but
why
doth
lord

delight
this
thing
Samuel
Notwithstanding
the
king
word
prevailed
against

and
against

And
Joab
and

went

And
they
passed

and
unto

then
they

and
round
about

Samuel
and
came

when

and
fro
through

they
came

the
end

and
twenty
days
Samuel
And
Joab
gave
the
sum
the
numbering
the
people
unto
the
king
and
there
were
Israel
eight
hundred
thousand
valiant
men
that
drew
the
sword
and
the
men
Judah
were
five
hundred
thousand
men
Samuel
And
David
heart
smote
him
after
that
had
numbered
the
people
And
David
said
unto
Jehovah
have
sinned
greatly
that
which
have
done
but
now
Jehovah
put
away
beseech
thee
the
iniquity
thy
servant
for
have
done
very
foolishly
Samuel
And
when
David
rose
the
morning
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
the
prophet
Gad
David
seer
saying
Samuel
and
speak
unto
David
Thus
saith
Jehovah
offer
thee
three
things
choose
thee
one
them
that
may
unto
thee
Samuel
Gad
came
David
and
told
him
and
said
unto
him
Shall
seven
years
famine
come
unto
thee
thy
land
wilt
thou
flee
three
months
before
thy
foes
while
they
pursue
thee
shall
there
three
days
pestilence
thy
land
now
advise
thee
and
consider
what
answer
shall
return
him
that
sent
Samuel
And
David
said
unto
Gad
great
strait
let
fall
now
into
the
hand
Jehovah
for
his
mercies
are
great
and
let
not
fall
into
the
hand
man
Samuel
Jehovah
sent
pestilence
upon
Israel
from
the
morning
even
the
time
appointed
and
there
died
the
people
from
Dan
even
Beer
sheba
seventy
thousand
men
Samuel
And
when
the
angel
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
Jerusalem
destroy
Jehovah
repented
him
the
evil
and
said
the
angel
that
destroyed
the
people
enough
now
stay
thy
hand
And
the
angel
Jehovah
was
the
threshing
floor
Araunah
the
Jebusite
Samuel
And
David
spake
unto
Jehovah
when
saw
the
angel
that
smote
the
people
and
said
have
sinned
and
have
done
perversely
but
these
sheep
what
have
they
done
let
thy
hand
pray
thee
against
and
against
father
house
Samuel
And
Gad
came
that
day
David
and
said
unto
him
rear
altar
unto
Jehovah
the
threshing
floor
Araunah
the
Jebusite
Samuel
And
David
went
according
the
saying
Gad
Jehovah
commanded
Samuel
And
Araunah
looked
forth
and
saw
the
king
and
his
servants
coming
toward
him
and
Araunah
went
out
and
bowed
himself
before
the
king
with
his
face
the
ground
Samuel
And
Araunah
said
Wherefore
lord
the
king
come
his
servant
And
David
said
buy
the
threshing
floor
thee
build
altar
unto
Jehovah
that
the
plague
may
stayed
from
the
people
Samuel
And
Araunah
said
unto
David
Let
lord
the
king
take
and
offer
what
seemeth
good
unto
him
behold
the
oxen
for
the
burnt
offering
and
the
threshing
instruments
and
the
yokes
the
oxen
for
the
wood
Samuel
all
this
king
doth
Araunah
give
unto
the
king
And
Araunah
said
unto
the
king
Jehovah
thy
God
accept
thee
Samuel
And
the
king
said
unto
Araunah
Nay
but
will
verily
buy
thee
price
neither
will
offer
burnt
offerings
unto
Jehovah
God
which
cost
nothing
David
bought
the
threshing
floor
and
the
oxen
for
fifty
shekels
silver
Samuel
And
David
built
there
altar
unto
Jehovah
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
Jehovah
was
entreated
for
the
land
and
the
plague
was
stayed
from
Israel
Kings
Now
king
David
was
old
and
stricken
years
and
they
covered
him
with
clothes
but
gat
heat
Kings
Wherefore
his
servants
said
unto
him
Let
there
sought
for
lord
the
king
young
virgin
and
let
her
stand
before
the
king
and
cherish
him
and
let
her
lie
thy
bosom
that
lord
the
king
may
get
heat
Kings
they
sought
for
fair
damsel
throughout
all
the
borders
Israel
and
found
Abishag
the
Shunammite
and
brought
her
the
king
Kings
And
the
damsel
was
very
fair
and
she
cherished
the
king
and
ministered
him
but
the
king
knew
her
not
Kings
Then
Adonijah
the
son
Haggith
exalted
himself
saying
will
king
and
prepared
him
chariots
and
horsemen
and
fifty
men
run
before
him
Kings
And
his
father
had
not
displeased
him
any
time
saying
Why
hast
thou
done
and
was
also
very
goodly
man
and
was
born
after
Absalom
Kings
And
conferred
with
Joab
the
son
Zeruiah
and
with
Abiathar
the
priest
and
they
following
Adonijah
helped
him
Kings
But
Zadok
the
priest
and
Benaiah
the
son
Jehoiada
and
Nathan
the
prophet
and
Shimei
and
Rei
and
the
mighty
men
that
belonged
David
were
not
with
Adonijah
Kings
And
Adonijah
slew
sheep
and
oxen
and
fatlings
the
stone
Zoheleth
which
beside
rogel
and
called
all
his
brethren
the
king
sons
and
all
the
men
Judah
the
king
servants
Kings
but
Nathan
the
prophet
and
Benaiah
and
the
mighty
men
and
Solomon
his
brother
called
not
Kings
Then
Nathan
spake
unto
Bath
sheba
the
mother
Solomon
saying
Hast
thou
not
heard
that
Adonijah
the
son
Haggith
doth
reign
and
David
our
lord
knoweth
not
Kings
Now
therefore
come
let
pray
thee
give
thee
counsel
that
thou
mayest
save
thine
own
life
and
the
life
thy
son
Solomon
Kings
and
get
thee
unto
king
David
and
say
unto
him
Didst
not
thou
lord
king
swear
unto
thy
handmaid
saying
Assuredly
Solomon
thy
son
shall
reign
after
and
shall
sit
upon
throne
why
then
doth
Adonijah
reign
Kings
Behold
while
thou
yet
talkest
there
with
the
king
also
will
come
after
thee
and
confirm
thy
words
Kings
And
Bath
sheba
went
unto
the
king
into
the
chamber
and
the
king
was
very
old
and
Abishag
the
Shunammite
was
ministering
unto
the
king
Kings
And
Bath
sheba
bowed
and
did
obeisance
unto
the
king
And
the
king
said
What
wouldest
thou
Kings
And
she
said
unto
him
lord
thou
swarest
Jehovah
thy
God
unto
thy
handmaid
saying
Assuredly
Solomon
thy
son
shall
reign
after
and
shall
sit
upon
throne
Kings
And
now
behold
Adonijah
reigneth
and
thou
lord
the
king
knowest
not
Kings
and
hath
slain
oxen
and
fatlings
and
sheep
abundance
and
hath
called
all
the
sons
the
king
and
Abiathar
the
priest
and
Joab
the
captain
the
host
but
Solomon
thy
servant
hath
not
called
Kings
And
thou
lord
the
king
the
eyes
all
Israel
are
upon
thee
that
thou
shouldest
tell
them
who
shall
sit
the
throne
lord
the
king
after
him
Kings
Otherwise
will
come
pass
when
lord
the
king
shall
sleep
with
his
fathers
that
and
son
Solomon
shall
counted
offenders
Kings
And
while
she
yet
talked
with
the
king
Nathan
the
prophet
came
Kings
And
they
told
the
king
saying
Behold
Nathan
the
prophet
And
when
was
come
before
the
king
bowed
himself
before
the
king
with
his
face
the
ground
Kings
And
Nathan
said
lord
king
hast
thou
said
Adonijah
shall
reign
after
and
shall
sit
upon
throne
Kings
For
gone
down
this
day
and
hath
slain
oxen
and
fatlings
and
sheep
abundance
and
hath
called
all
the
king
sons
and
the
captains
the
host
and
Abiathar
the
priest
and
behold
they
are
eating
and
drinking
before
him
and
say
Long
live
king
Adonijah
Kings
But
even
thy
servant
and
Zadok
the
priest
and
Benaiah
the
son
Jehoiada
and
thy
servant
Solomon
hath
not
called
Kings
this
thing
done
lord
the
king
and
thou
hast
not
showed
unto
thy
servants
who
should
sit
the
throne
lord
the
king
after
him
Kings
Then
king
David
answered
and
said
Call
Bath
sheba
And
she
came
into
the
king
presence
and
stood
before
the
king
Kings
And
the
king
sware
and
said
Jehovah
liveth
who
hath
redeemed
soul
out
all
adversity
Kings
verily
sware
unto
thee
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
saying
Assuredly
Solomon
thy
son
shall
reign
after
and
shall
sit
upon
throne
stead
verily
will
this
day
Kings
Then
Bath
sheba
bowed
with
her
face
the
earth
and
did
obeisance
the
king
and
said
Let
lord
king
David
live
for
ever
Kings
And
king
David
said
Call
Zadok
the
priest
and
Nathan
the
prophet
and
Benaiah
the
son
Jehoiada
And
they
came
before
the
king
Kings
And
the
king
said
unto
them
Take
with
you
the
servants
your
lord
and
cause
Solomon

and

and

Then

come
and
sit
upon

for

and
over

Kings
And
Benaiah
the
son
Jehoiada
answered
the
king
and
said
Amen
Jehovah
the
God
lord
the
king
say
too
Kings
Jehovah
hath
been
with

the
king
even
with

Kings
Zadok
the
priest
and
Nathan
the
prophet
and
Benaiah
the
son
Jehoiada
and
the
Cherethites
and
the
Pelethites
went
down
and
caused
Solomon

upon
king
David
mule
and
brought
him
Gihon
Kings
And
Zadok
the
priest
took
the
horn
oil
out
the
Tent
and
anointed
Solomon
And
they
blew
the
trumpet
and
all
the
people
said
Long
live
king
Solomon
Kings
And
all
the
people
came
after
him
and
the
people
piped
with
pipes
and
rejoiced
with
great
joy
that
the
earth
rent
with
the
sound
them
Kings
And
Adonijah
and
all
the
guests
that
were
with
him
heard
they
had
made
end
eating
And
when
Joab
heard
the
sound
the
trumpet
said
Wherefore
this
noise
the
city
being
uproar
Kings
While
yet
spake
behold
Jonathan
the
son
Abiathar
the
priest
came
and
Adonijah
said
Come
for
thou
art
worthy
man
and
bringest
good
tidings
Kings
And
Jonathan
answered
and
said
Adonijah
Verily
our
lord
king
David
hath
made
Solomon
king
Kings
and
the
king
hath
sent
with
him
Zadok
the
priest
and
Nathan
the
prophet
and
Benaiah
the
son
Jehoiada
and
the
Cherethites
and
the
Pelethites
and
they
have
caused
him
ride
upon
the
king
mule
Kings
and
Zadok
the
priest
and
Nathan
the
prophet
have
anointed
him
king
Gihon
and
they
are
come
from
thence
rejoicing
that
the
city
rang
again
This
the
noise
that
have
heard
Kings
And
also
Solomon
sitteth
the
throne
the
kingdom
Kings
And
moreover
the
king
servants
came
bless
our
lord
king
David
saying
Thy
God
make
the
name
Solomon
better
than
thy
name
and
make
his
throne
greater
than
thy
throne
and
the
king
bowed
himself
upon
the
bed
Kings
And
also
thus
said
the
king
Blessed
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
who
hath
given
one
sit
throne
this
day
mine
eyes
even
seeing
Kings
And
all
the
guests
Adonijah
were
afraid
and
rose
and
went
every
man
his
way
Kings
And
Adonijah
feared
because
Solomon
and
arose
and
went
and
caught
hold
the
horns
the
altar
Kings
And
was
told
Solomon
saying
Behold
Adonijah
feareth
king
Solomon
for
hath
laid
hold
the
horns
the
altar
saying
Let
king
Solomon
swear
unto
first
that
will
not
slay
his
servant
with
the
sword
Kings
And
Solomon
said
shall
show
himself
worthy
man
there
shall
not
hair
him
fall
the
earth
but
wickedness
found
him
shall
die
Kings
king
Solomon
sent
and
they
brought
him
down
from
the
altar
And
came
and
did
obeisance
king
Solomon
and
Solomon
said
unto
him
thy
house
Kings
Now
the
days
David
drew
nigh
that
should
die
and
charged
Solomon
his
son
saying
Kings
going
the
way
all
the
earth

strong
therefore
and
show
thyself
man
Kings
and
keep

ways
keep
his
statutes
and
his
commandments
and
his
ordinances
and
his
testimonies
according
that
which
written
the
law
Moses
that
thou
mayest
prosper
all
that
thou
doest
and
whithersoever
thou
turnest
thyself
Kings
that
Jehovah
may
establish
his
word
which
spake
concerning

thy
children
take
heed
their
way
walk
before
truth
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul
there
shall
not
fail
thee
said
man
the
throne
Israel
Kings
Moreover
thou
knowest
also
what
Joab
the
son
Zeruiah
did
unto
even
what
did
the
two
captains
the
hosts
Israel
unto
Abner
the
son
Ner
and
unto
Amasa
the
son
Jether
whom
slew
and
shed
the
blood
war
peace
and
put
the
blood
war
upon
his
girdle
that
was
about
his
loins
and
his
shoes
that
were
his
feet
Kings
therefore
according
thy
wisdom
and
let
not
his
hoar
head
down
Sheol
peace
Kings
But
show
kindness
unto
the
sons
Barzillai
the
Gileadite
and
let
them
those
that
eat
thy
table
for
they
came
when
fled
from
Absalom
thy
brother
Kings
And
behold
there
with
thee
Shimei
the
son
Gera
the
Benjamite
Bahurim
who
cursed
with
grievous
curse
the
day
when
went
Mahanaim
but
came
down
meet
the
Jordan
and
sware
him
Jehovah
saying
will
not
put
thee
death
with
the
sword
Kings
Now
therefore
hold
him
not
guiltless
for
thou
art
wise
man
and
thou
wilt
know
what
thou
oughtest
unto
him
and
thou
shalt
bring
his
hoar
head
down
Sheol
with
blood
Kings
And
David
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
the
city
David
Kings
And
the
days
that
David
reigned
over
Israel
were
forty
years
seven
years
reigned
Hebron
and
thirty
and
three
years
reigned
Jerusalem
Kings
And
Solomon
sat
upon
the
throne
David
his
father
and
his
kingdom
was
established
greatly
Kings
Then
Adonijah
the
son
Haggith
came
Bath
sheba
the
mother
Solomon
And
she
said
Comest
thou
peaceably
And
said
Peaceably
Kings
said
moreover
have
somewhat
say
unto
thee
And
she
said
Say
Kings
And
said
Thou
knowest
that
the
kingdom
was
mine
and
that
all
Israel
set
their

Then

Then
king
Solomon
sware
Jehovah
saying
God
and
more
also
Adonijah
hath
not
spoken
this

Kings
Now

promised
surely
Adonijah

Kings
And
king
Solomon
sent
Benaiah
the

Jehoiada
and
fell
upon
him
that
died
Kings
And
unto
Abiathar
the
priest
said
the
king
Get
thee
Anathoth
unto
thine

fields
for
thou
art
worthy
death
but
will
not
this
time
put
thee
death
because
thou
barest

the
Lord
Jehovah
before
David
father
and
because
thou
wast
afflicted
all
wherein
father
was
afflicted
Kings
Solomon
thrust
out
Abiathar
from
being
priest
unto
Jehovah
that
might
fulfil
the
word
Jehovah
which
spake
concerning
the
house
Eli
Shiloh
Kings
And
the
tidings
came
Joab
for
Joab
had
turned
after
Adonijah
though

not
after
Absalom
And
Joab
fled
unto
the
Tent
Jehovah
and
caught
hold
the
horns

altar
Kings
And
was
told
king
Solomon
Joab
fled
unto
the
Tent
Jehovah
and
behold
the
altar
Then
Solomon
sent
Benaiah
the
son
Jehoiada
saying
fall
upon
him
Kings
And
Benaiah
came

Tent
Jehovah
and
said
unto
him
Thus
saith
the
king
Come
forth
And
said
Nay
but
will
die
here
And
Benaiah
brought
the
king
word
again
saying
Thus
said
Joab
and
thus
answered
Kings
And
the
king
said
unto
him
hath
said
and
fall
upon
him
and
bury
him
that
thou
mayest
take
away
the
blood
which
Joab
shed
without
cause
from
and
from
father
house
Kings
And
Jehovah
will
return
his
blood
upon
his
own
head
because
fell
upon
two
men
more
righteous
and
better
than
and
slew
them
with
the
sword
and
father
David
knew
not
wit
Abner
the
son
Ner
captain
the
host
Israel
and
Amasa
the
son
Jether
captain
the
host
Judah
Kings
shall
their
blood
return
upon
the

Joab
and
upon

David
and
unto
his
seed
and
unto
his
house
and
unto
his
throne
shall
there
peace
for
ever
from
Jehovah
Kings
Then
Benaiah
the
son
Jehoiada
went
and
fell
upon
him
and
slew
him
and
was
buried
his
own
house
the
wilderness
Kings
And
the
king
put
Benaiah
the
son
Jehoiada
his
room
over
the
host
and
Zadok
the
priest
did
the
king
put

room
Abiathar
Kings
And
the
king
sent
and
called
for
Shimei
and
said
unto
him
Build
thee
house
Jerusalem
and
dwell
there
and
not
forth
thence
any
whither
Kings
For
the
day
thou
goest
out
and
passest

thou
for

that
thou
shalt
surely
die
thy

Kings
And
Shimei
said
unto
the
king
The
saying

lord
the

And

And

ran
away
unto

son
Maacah
king
Gath
And
they
told
Shimei
saying
Behold
thy
servants
are
Gath
Kings
And
Shimei
arose
and
saddled
his
ass
and
went
Gath
Achish
seek
his
servants
and
Shimei
went
and
brought
his
servants
from
Gath
Kings
And
was
told
Solomon
that
Shimei
had
gone
from
Jerusalem
Gath
and
was
come
again
Kings
And
the
king
sent
and
called
for
Shimei
and
said
unto
him
Did
not
adjure
thee
Jehovah
and
protest
unto
thee
saying
Know
for
certain
that
the
day
thou
goest
out
and
walkest
abroad
any
whither
thou
shalt
surely
die
and
thou
saidst
unto
The
saying
that
have
heard
good
Kings
Why
then
hast
thou
not
kept
the
oath
Jehovah
and
the
commandment
that
have
charged
thee
with
Kings
The
king
said
moreover
Shimei
Thou
knowest
all
the
wickedness
which
thy
heart
privy
that
thou
didst
David
father
therefore
Jehovah
shall
return
thy
wickedness
upon

Kings
But

the

and
fell
upon

And
the

Kings
And
Solomon
made

Egypt
and
took

daughter
and
brought
her

city
David
until

and
the
house
Jehovah
and
the
wall
Jerusalem
round
about
Kings
Only
the
people
sacrificed
the
high
places
because
there
was
house
built
for
the

until

days
Kings
And
Solomon
loved
Jehovah
walking
the
statutes
David
his

only
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense

high
places
Kings
And
the
king
went

there
for
that

did
Solomon
offer
upon

Gibeon
Jehovah
appeared
Solomon

and
God
said

And
Solomon
said
Thou

showed
unto

And

Kings
And
the
speech
pleased
the
Lord
that
Solomon
had
asked
this
thing
Kings
And
God
said
unto
him
Because
thou
hast
asked

and
hast
not
asked

Kings
And
thou
wilt
walk

And

Jehovah
Kings
that
the

could
not

Jehovah
filled

Then

said
that

dwell
the
thick
darkness
Kings
have
surely
built
thee
house
habitation
place
for

Kings
And
the
king
turned
his
face
about
and
blessed
all
the
assembly
Israel
and
all
the
assembly
Israel
stood
Kings
And
said
Blessed
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
who
spake
with
his
mouth
unto
David
thy
father
and
hath
with
his
hand
fulfilled
saying
Kings
Since
the
day
that
brought
forth
people
Israel
out
Egypt
chose
city
out
all
the
tribes
Israel
build
house
that
name
might
there
but
chose
David
over
people
Israel
Kings
Now
was
the
heart
David
father
build
house
for
the
name
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Kings
But
Jehovah
said
unto
David
father
Whereas
was
thy
heart
build
house
for
name
thou
didst
well
that
was
thy
heart
Kings
nevertheless
thou
shalt
not
build
the
house
but
thy
son
that
shall
come
forth
out
thy
loins
shall
build
the
house
for
name
Kings
And
Jehovah
hath
established
his

Kings
And
there

And
Solomon

Kings
and
said
Jehovah
the

Israel
there
God
like

beneath
who

Now

Now
therefore
God
Israel
let

But

Kings
that

and
unto
the

Israel
hearken
unto
them
whensoever

For

arose
from

the
altar
Jehovah
from

with
his

spread
forth
toward

Kings
And
stood
and
blessed
all
the
assembly
Israel
with
loud
voice
saying
Kings
Blessed
Jehovah
that
hath
given
rest
unto
his
people
Israel
according
all
that
promised
there
hath
not
failed
one
word
all
his
good
promise
which
promised
Moses
his
servant
Kings
Jehovah
our
God
with
was
with
our
fathers
let
him
not
leave
nor
forsake
Kings
that
may
incline
our
hearts
unto
him
walk
all
his
ways
and
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
and
his
ordinances
which
commanded
our
fathers
Kings
And
let
these
words
wherewith
have
made
supplication
before
Jehovah
nigh
unto
Jehovah
our
God
day
and
night
that
maintain
the
cause
his
servant
and
the
cause
his
people
Israel
every
day
shall
require
Kings
that
all
the
peoples
the
earth
may
know
that
Jehovah
God
there
none
else
Kings
Let
your
heart
therefore
perfect
with
Jehovah
our
God
walk
his
statutes
and
keep
his
commandments
this
day
Kings
And
the
king
and
all
Israel
with
him
offered
sacrifice
before
Jehovah
Kings
And
Solomon
offered
for
the
sacrifice
peace
offerings
which
offered
unto
Jehovah
two
and
twenty
thousand
oxen
and
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
sheep
the
king
and
all
the
children
Israel
dedicated
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
The
same
day
did
the
king
hallow
the
middle
the
court
that
was
before
the
house
Jehovah
for
there
offered
the
burnt
offering
and
the
meal
offering
and
the
fat
the
peace
offerings
because
the
brazen
altar
that
was
before
Jehovah
was
too
little
receive
the
burnt
offering
and
the
meal
offering
and
the
fat
the
peace
offerings
Kings
Solomon
held
the
feast
that
time
and
all
Israel
with
him
great
assembly
from
the
entrance
Hamath
unto
the
brook
Egypt
before
Jehovah
our
God
seven
days
and
seven
days
even
fourteen
days
Kings
the
eighth
day
sent
the
people
away
and
they
blessed
the
king
and
went
unto
their
tents
joyful
and
glad
heart
for
all
the
goodness
that
Jehovah
had
showed
unto
David
his
servant
and
Israel
his
people
Kings
And
came
pass
when
Solomon
had
finished
the
building
the
house
Jehovah
and
the
king
house
and
all
Solomon
desire
which
was
pleased
Kings
that
Jehovah
appeared
Solomon
the
second
time
had
appeared
unto
him
Gibeon
Kings
And
Jehovah
said
unto
him
have
heard
thy
prayer
and
thy
supplication
that
thou
hast
made
before
have
hallowed
this
house
which
thou
hast
built
put
name
there
for
ever
and
mine
eyes
and
heart
shall
there
perpetually
Kings
And
for
thee
thou
wilt
walk
before
David
thy
father
walked
integrity
heart
and
uprightness
according
all
that
have
commanded
thee
and
wilt
keep
statutes
and
mine
ordinances
Kings
then
will
establish
the
throne
thy
kingdom
over
Israel
for
ever
according
promised
David
thy
father
saying
There
shall
not
fail
thee
man
upon
the
throne
Israel
Kings
But
shall
turn
away
from
following
your
children
and
not
keep
commandments
and
statutes
which
have
set
before
you
but
shall
and
serve
other
gods
and
worship
them
Kings
then
will
cut
off
Israel
out
the
land
which
have
given
them
and
this
house
which
have
hallowed
for
name
will
cast
out
sight
and
Israel
shall
proverb
and
byword
among
all
peoples
Kings
And
though
this
house
high
yet
shall
every
one
that
passeth
astonished
and
shall
hiss
and
they
shall
say
Why
hath
Jehovah
done
thus
unto
this
land
and
this
house
Kings
and
they
shall
answer
Because
they
forsook
Jehovah
their
God
who
brought
forth
their
fathers
out
the
land
Egypt
and
laid
hold
other
gods
and
worshipped
them
and
served
them
therefore
hath
Jehovah
brought
all
this
evil
upon
them
Kings
And
came
pass
the
end
twenty
years
wherein
Solomon
had
built
the
two
houses
the
house
Jehovah
and
the
king
house
Kings
now
Hiram
the
king
Tyre
had
furnished
Solomon
with
cedar
trees
and
fir
trees
and
with
gold
according
all
his
desire
that
then
king
Solomon
gave
Hiram
twenty
cities
the
land
Galilee
Kings
And
Hiram
came
out
from
Tyre
see
the
cities
which
Solomon
had
given
him
and
they
pleased
him
not
Kings
And
said
What
cities
are
these
which
thou
hast
given
brother
And
called
them
the
land
Cabul
unto
this
day
Kings
And
Hiram
sent
the
king
sixscore
talents
gold
Kings
And
this
the
reason
the
levy
which
king
Solomon
raised
build
the
house
Jehovah
and
his
own
house
and
Millo
and
the
wall
Jerusalem
and
Hazor
and
Megiddo
and
Gezer
Kings
Pharaoh
king
Egypt
had
gone
and
taken
Gezer
and
burnt
with
fire
and
slain
the
Canaanites
that
dwelt
the
city
and
given
for
portion
unto
his
daughter
Solomon
wife
Kings
And
Solomon
built
Gezer
and
Beth
horon
the
nether
Kings
and
Baalath
and
Tamar
the
wilderness
the
land
Kings
and
all
the
store
cities
that
Solomon
had
and
the
cities
for
his
chariots
and
the
cities
for
his
horsemen
and
that
which
Solomon
desired
build
for
his
pleasure
Jerusalem
and
Lebanon
and
all
the
land
his
dominion
Kings
for
all
the
people
that
were
left
the
Amorites
the
Hittites
the
Perizzites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
who
were
not
the
children
Israel
Kings
their
children
that
were
left
after
them
the
land
whom
the
children
Israel
were
not
able
utterly
destroy
them
did
Solomon
raise
levy
bondservants
unto
this
day
Kings
But
the
children
Israel
did
Solomon
make
bondservants
but
they
were
the
men
war
and
his
servants
and
his
princes
and
his
captains
and
rulers
his
chariots
and
his
horsemen
Kings
These
were
the
chief
officers
that
were
over
Solomon
work
five
hundred
and
fifty
who
bare
rule
over
the
people
that
wrought
the
work
Kings
But
Pharaoh
daughter
came
out
the
city
David
unto
her
house
which
Solomon
had
built
for
her
then
did
build
Millo
Kings
And
three
times
year
did
Solomon
offer
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
upon
the
altar
which
built
unto
Jehovah
burning
incense
therewith
upon
the
altar
that
was
before
Jehovah
finished
the
house
Kings
And
king
Solomon
made
navy
ships
Ezion
geber
which
beside
Eloth
the
shore
the
Red
Sea
the
land
Edom
Kings
And
Hiram
sent
the
navy
his
servants
shipmen
that
had
knowledge
the
sea
with
the
servants
Solomon
Kings
And
they
came
Ophir
and
fetched
from
thence
gold
four
hundred
and
twenty
talents
and
brought
king
Solomon
Kings
And
when
the
queen
Sheba
heard
the
fame
Solomon
concerning
the
name
Jehovah
she
came
prove
him
with
hard
questions
Kings
And
she
came
Jerusalem
with
very
great
train
with
camels
that
bare
spices
and
very
much
gold
and
precious
stones
and
when
she
was
come
Solomon
she
communed
with
him
all
that
was
her
heart
Kings
And
Solomon
told
her
all
her
questions
there
was
not
anything
hid
from
the
king
which
told
her
not
Kings
And
when
the
queen
Sheba
had
seen
all
the
wisdom
Solomon
and
the
house
that
had
built
Kings
and
the
food
his
table
and
the
sitting
his
servants
and
the
attendance
his
ministers
and
their
apparel
and
his
cupbearers
and
his
ascent
which
went
unto
the
house
Jehovah
there
was
more
spirit
her
Kings
And
she
said
the
king
was
true
report
that
heard
mine
own
land
thine
acts
and
thy
wisdom
Kings
Howbeit
believed
not
the
words
until
came
and
mine
eyes
had
seen
and
behold
the
half
was
not
told
thy
wisdom
and
prosperity
exceed
the
fame
which
heard
Kings
Happy
are
thy
men
happy
are
these
thy
servants
that
stand
continually
before
thee
and
that
hear
thy
wisdom
Kings
Blessed
Jehovah
thy
God
who
delighted
thee
set
thee
the
throne
Israel
because
Jehovah
loved
Israel
for
ever
therefore
made
thee
king
justice
and
righteousness
Kings
And
she
gave
the
king
hundred
and
twenty
talents
gold
and
spices
very
great
store
and
precious
stones
there
came
more
such
abundance
spices
these
which
the
queen
Sheba
gave
king
Solomon
Kings
And
the
navy
also
Hiram
that
brought
gold
from
Ophir
brought
from
Ophir
great
plenty
almug
trees
and
precious
stones
Kings
And
the
king
made
the
almug
trees
pillars
for
the
house
Jehovah
and
for
the
king
house
harps
also
and
psalteries
for
the
singers
there
came
such
almug
trees
nor
were
seen
unto
this
day
Kings
And
king
Solomon
gave
the
queen
Sheba
all
her
desire
whatsoever
she
asked
besides
that
which
Solomon
gave
her
his
royal
bounty
she
turned
and
went

own
land
she
and
her
servants
Kings
Now
the
weight
gold
that
came
Solomon
one
year
was
six
hundred
threescore
and
six
talents
gold
Kings
besides
that
which
the
traders
brought
and
the
traffic
the
merchants
and
all
the
kings
the
mingled
people
and
the
governors

country
Kings
And
king
Solomon
made

And
made
three
hundred
shields
beaten

three
pounds
gold
went

and
the
king
put

forest
Lebanon
Kings
Moreover
the
king
made
great
throne
ivory
and
overlaid
with
the
finest
gold
Kings
There
were
six
steps

throne
and
the
top
the
throne
was
round
behind
and
there
were
stays

side
the
place
the
seat
and
two
lions
standing
beside
the
stays
Kings
And
twelve
lions
stood
there
the
one
side
and
the
other
upon
the
six
steps
there
was
not
the
like
made
any

Kings
And
all

were

and
all
the
vessels

forest
Lebanon
were
pure
gold
none
were

For

Kings
And
all
the
earth
sought
the
presence
Solomon

his
wisdom
which

had
put

Kings
And
they
brought
every
man
his
tribute
vessels
silver
and

and
raiment
and

Kings
And
Solomon
gathered
together
chariots
and
horsemen
and
had
thousand
and
four
hundred
chariots
and
twelve
thousand
horsemen
that
bestowed
the
chariot
cities
and
with
the
king
Jerusalem
Kings
And
the
king
made
silver
Jerusalem
stones
and
cedars
made
the
sycomore
trees
that
are
the
lowland
for
abundance
Kings
And
the
horses
which
Solomon
had
were
brought
out
Egypt
and
the
king
merchants
received
them
droves
each
drove
price
Kings
And
chariot
came
and
went
out
Egypt
for
six
hundred
shekels
silver
and
horse
for
hundred
and
fifty
and
for
all
the
kings
the
Hittites
and
for
the
kings
Syria
did
they
bring
them
out
their
means
Kings
Now
king
Solomon
loved
many
foreign
women
together
with
the
daughter
Pharaoh
women
the
Moabites
Ammonites
Edomites
Sidonians
and
Hittites
Kings
the
nations
concerning
which
Jehovah
said
unto
the
children
Israel
shall
not
among
them
neither
shall
they
come
among
you
for
surely
they
will
turn
away
your
heart
after
their
gods
Solomon
clave
unto
these
love
Kings
And
had
seven
hundred
wives
princesses
and
three
hundred
concubines
and
his
wives
turned
away
his
heart
Kings
For
came
pass
when
Solomon
was
old
that
his
wives
turned
away
his
heart
after
other
gods
and
his
heart
was
not
perfect
with
Jehovah
his
God
was
the
heart
David
his
father
Kings
For
Solomon
went
after
Ashtoreth
the
goddess
the
Sidonians
and
after
Milcom
the
abomination
the
Ammonites
Kings
And
Solomon
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
and
went
not
fully
after
Jehovah
did
David
his
father
Kings
Then
did
Solomon
build
high
place
for
Chemosh
the
abomination
Moab
the
mount
that
before
Jerusalem
and
for
Molech
the
abomination
the
children
Ammon
Kings
And
did
for
all
his
foreign
wives
who
burnt
incense
and
sacrificed
unto
their
gods
Kings
And
Jehovah
was
angry
with
Solomon
because
his
heart
was
turned
away
from
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
who
had
appeared
unto
him
twice
Kings
and
had
commanded
him
concerning
this
thing
that
should
not
after
other
gods
but
kept
not
that
which
Jehovah
commanded
Kings
Wherefore
Jehovah
said
unto
Solomon
Forasmuch
this
done
thee
and
thou
hast
not
kept
covenant
and
statutes
which
have
commanded
thee
will
surely
rend
the
kingdom
from
thee
and
will
give
thy
servant
Kings
Notwithstanding
thy
days
will
not
for
David
thy
father
sake
but
will
rend
out
the
hand
thy
son
Kings
Howbeit
will
not
rend
away
all
the
kingdom
but
will
give
one
tribe
thy
son
for
David
servant
sake
and
for
Jerusalem
sake
which
have
chosen
Kings
And
Jehovah
raised
adversary
unto
Solomon
Hadad
the
Edomite
was
the
king
seed
Edom
Kings
For
came
pass
when
David
was
Edom
and
Joab
the
captain
the
host
was
gone
bury
the
slain
and
had
smitten
every
male
Edom
Kings
for
Joab
and
all
Israel
remained
there
six
months
until
had
cut
off
every
male
Edom
Kings
that
Hadad
fled
and
certain
Edomites
his
father
servants
with
him
into
Egypt
Hadad
being
yet
little
child
Kings
And
they
arose
out
Midian
and
came
Paran
and
they
took
men
with
them
out
Paran
and
they
came
Egypt
unto
Pharaoh
king
Egypt
who
gave
him
house
and
appointed
him
victuals
and
gave
him
land
Kings
And
Hadad
found
great
favor
the
sight
Pharaoh
that
gave
him
wife
the
sister
his
own
wife
the
sister
Tahpenes
the
queen
Kings
And
the
sister
Tahpenes
bare
him
Genubath
his
son
whom
Tahpenes
weaned
Pharaoh
house
and
Genubath
was
Pharaoh
house
among
the
sons
Pharaoh
Kings
And
when
Hadad
heard
Egypt
that
David
slept
with
his
fathers
and
that
Joab
the
captain
the
host
was
dead
Hadad
said
Pharaoh
Let
depart
that
may
mine
own
country
Kings
Then
Pharaoh
said
unto
him
But
what
hast
thou
lacked
with
that
behold
thou
seekest
thine
own
country
And
answered
Nothing
howbeit
only
let
depart
Kings
And
God
raised
another
adversary
unto
him
Rezon
the
son
Eliada
who
had
fled
from
his
lord
Hadadezer
king
Zobah
Kings
And
gathered
men
unto
him
and
became
captain
over
troop
when
David
slew
them
Zobah
and
they
went
Damascus
and
dwelt
therein
and
reigned
Damascus
Kings
And
was
adversary
Israel
all
the
days
Solomon
besides
the
mischief
that
Hadad
did
and
abhorred
Israel
and
reigned
over
Syria
Kings
And
Jeroboam
the
son
Nebat
Ephraimite
Zeredah
servant
Solomon
whose
mother
name
was
Zeruah
widow
also
lifted
his
hand
against
the
king
Kings
And
this
was
the
reason
why
lifted
his
hand
against
the
king
Solomon
built
Millo
and
repaired
the
breach
the
city
David
his
father
Kings
And
the
man
Jeroboam
was
mighty
man
valor
and
Solomon
saw
the
young
man
that
was
industrious
and
gave
him
charge
over
all
the
labor
the
house
Joseph
Kings
And
came
pass
that
time
when
Jeroboam
went
out
Jerusalem
that
the
prophet
Ahijah
the
Shilonite
found
him
the
way
now
Ahijah
had
clad
himself
with
new
garment
and
they
two
were
alone
the
field
Kings
And
Ahijah
laid
hold
the
new
garment
that
was
him
and
rent
twelve
pieces
Kings
And
said
Jeroboam
Take
thee
ten
pieces
for
thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Behold
will
rend
the
kingdom
out
the
hand
Solomon
and
will
give
ten
tribes
thee
Kings
but
shall
have
one
tribe
for
servant
David
sake
and
for
Jerusalem
sake
the
city
which
have
chosen
out
all
the
tribes
Israel
Kings
because
that
they
have
forsaken
and
have
worshipped
Ashtoreth
the
goddess
the
Sidonians
Chemosh
the
god
Moab
and
Milcom
the
god
the
children
Ammon
and
they
have
not
walked
ways
that
which
right
mine
eyes
and
keep
statutes
and
mine
ordinances
did
David
his
father
Kings
Howbeit
will
not
take
the
whole
kingdom
out
his
hand
but
will
make
him
prince
all
the
days
his
life
for
David
servant
sake
whom
chose
who
kept
commandments
and
statutes
Kings
but
will
take
the
kingdom
out
his
son
hand
and
will
give
unto
thee
even
ten
tribes
Kings
And
unto
his
son
will
give
one
tribe
that
David
servant
may
have
lamp
alway
before
Jerusalem
the
city
which
have
chosen
put
name
there
Kings
And
will
take
thee
and
thou
shalt
reign
according
all
that
thy
soul
desireth
and
shalt
king
over
Israel
Kings
And
shall
thou
wilt
hearken
unto
all
that
command
thee
and
wilt
walk
ways
and
that
which
right
mine
eyes
keep
statutes
and
commandments
David
servant
did
that
will
with
thee
and
will
build
thee
sure
house
built
for
David
and
will
give
Israel
unto
thee
Kings
And
will
for
this
afflict
the
seed
David
but
not
for
ever
Kings
Solomon
sought
therefore
kill
Jeroboam
but
Jeroboam
arose
and
fled
into
Egypt
unto
Shishak
king
Egypt
and
was
Egypt
until
the
death
Solomon
Kings
Now
the
rest
the
acts
Solomon
and
all
that
did
and
his
wisdom
are
they
not
written
the
book
the
acts
Solomon
Kings
And
the
time
that
Solomon
reigned
Jerusalem
over
all
Israel
was
forty
years
Kings
And
Solomon
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
the
city
David
his
father
and
Rehoboam
his
son
reigned
his
stead
Kings
And
Rehoboam
went
Shechem
for
all
Israel
were
come
Shechem
make
him
king
Kings
And
came
pass
when
Jeroboam
the
son
Nebat
heard
for
was
yet
Egypt
whither
had
fled
from
the
presence
king
Solomon
and
Jeroboam
dwelt
Egypt
Kings
and
they
sent
and
called
him
that
Jeroboam
and
all
the
assembly
Israel
came
and
spake
unto
Rehoboam
saying
Kings
Thy
father
made
our
yoke
grievous
now
therefore
make
thou
the
grievous
service
thy
father
and
his
heavy
yoke
which
put
upon
lighter
and
will
serve
thee
Kings
And
said
unto
them
Depart
yet
for
three
days
then
come
again
And
the
people
departed
Kings
And
king
Rehoboam
took
counsel
with
the
old
men
that
had
stood
before
Solomon
his
father
while
yet
lived
saying
What
counsel
give
return
answer
this
people
Kings
And
they
spake
unto
him
saying
thou
wilt
servant
unto
this
people
this
day
and
wilt
serve
them
and
answer
them
and
speak
good
words
them
then
they
will
thy
servants
for
ever
Kings
But
forsook
the
counsel
the
old
men
which
they
had
given
him
and
took
counsel
with
the
young
men
that
were
grown
with
him
that
stood
before
him
Kings
And
said
unto
them
What
counsel
give
that
may
return
answer
this
people
who
have
spoken
saying
Make
the
yoke
that
thy
father
did
put
upon
lighter
Kings
And
the
young
men
that
were
grown
with
him
spake
unto
him
saying
Thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
this
people
that
spake
unto
thee
saying
Thy
father
made
our
yoke
heavy
but
make
thou
lighter
unto
thus
shalt
thou
speak
unto
them
little
finger
thicker
than
father
loins
Kings
And
now
whereas
father
did
lade
you
with
heavy
yoke
will
add
your
yoke
father
chastised
you
with
whips
but
will
chastise
you
with
scorpions
Kings
Jeroboam
and
all
the
people
came
Rehoboam
the
third
day
the
king
bade
saying
Come
again
the
third
day
Kings
And
the
king
answered
the
people
roughly
and
forsook
the
counsel
the
old
men
which
they
had
given
him
Kings
and
spake
them
after
the
counsel
the
young
men
saying
father
made
your
yoke
heavy
but
will
add
your
yoke
father
chastised
you
with
whips
but
will
chastise
you
with
scorpions
Kings
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
the
people
for
was
thing
brought
about
Jehovah
that
might
establish
his
word
which
Jehovah
spake
Ahijah
the
Shilonite
Jeroboam
the
son
Nebat
Kings
And
when
all
Israel
saw
that
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
them
the
people
answered
the
king
saying
What
portion
have
David
neither
have
inheritance
the
son
Jesse
your
tents
Israel
now
see
thine
own
house
David
Israel
departed
unto
their
tents
Kings
But
for
the
children
Israel
that
dwelt
the
cities
Judah
Rehoboam
reigned
over
them
Kings
Then
king
Rehoboam
sent
Adoram
who
was
over
the
men
subject
taskwork
and
all
Israel
stoned
him
death
with
stones
And
king
Rehoboam
made
speed
get
him
his
chariot
flee
Jerusalem
Kings
Israel
rebelled
against
the
house
David
unto
this
day
Kings
And
came
pass
when
all
Israel
heard
that
Jeroboam
was
returned
that
they
sent
and
called
him
unto
the
congregation
and
made
him
king
over
all
Israel
there
was
none
that
followed
the
house
David
but
the
tribe
Judah
only
Kings
And
when
Rehoboam
was
come
Jerusalem
assembled
all
the
house
Judah
and
the
tribe
Benjamin
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
chosen
men
that
were
warriors
fight
against
the
house
Israel
bring
the
kingdom
again
Rehoboam
the
son
Solomon
Kings
But
the
word
God
came
unto
Shemaiah
the
man
God
saying
Kings
Speak
unto
Rehoboam
the
son
Solomon
king
Judah
and
unto
all
the
house
Judah
and
Benjamin
and
the
rest
the
people
saying
Kings
Thus
saith
Jehovah
shall
not
nor
fight
against
your
brethren
the
children
Israel
return
every
man
his
house
for
this
thing
they
hearkened
unto
the
word
Jehovah
and
returned
and
went
their
way
according
the
word
Jehovah
Kings
Then
Jeroboam
built
Shechem
the
hill
country
Ephraim
and
dwelt
therein
and
went
out
from
thence
and
built
Penuel
Kings
And
Jeroboam
said
his
heart
Now
will
the
kingdom
return
the
house
David
Kings
this
people
offer
sacrifices
the
house
Jehovah
Jerusalem
then
will
the
heart
this
people
turn
again
unto
their
lord
even
unto
Rehoboam
king
Judah
and
they
will
kill
and
return
Rehoboam
king
Judah
Kings
Whereupon
the
king
took
counsel
and
made
two
calves
gold
and
said
unto
them
too
much
for
you
Jerusalem
behold
thy
gods
Israel
which
brought
thee
out
the
land
Egypt
Kings
And
set
the
one
Beth
and
the
other
put
Dan
Kings
And
this
thing
became
sin
for
the
people
went
worship
before
the
one
even
unto
Dan
Kings
And
made
houses
high
places
and
made
priests
from
among
all
the
people
that
were
not
the
sons
Levi
Kings
And
Jeroboam
ordained
feast
the
eighth
month
the
fifteenth
day
the
month
like
unto
the
feast
that
Judah
and
went
unto
the
altar
did
Beth
sacrificing
unto
the
calves
that
had
made
and
placed
Beth
the
priests
the
high
places
that
had
made
Kings
And
went
unto
the
altar
which
had
made
Beth
the
fifteenth
day
the
eighth
month
even
the
month
which
had
devised
his
own
heart
and
ordained
feast
for
the
children
Israel
and
went
unto
the
altar
burn
incense
Kings
And
behold
there
came
man
God
out
Judah
the
word
Jehovah
unto
Beth
and
Jeroboam
was
standing
the
altar
burn
incense
Kings
And
cried
against
the
altar
the
word
Jehovah
and
said
altar
altar
thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
son
shall
born
unto
the
house
David
Josiah
name
and
upon
thee
shall
sacrifice
the
priests
the
high
places
that
burn
incense
upon
thee
and
men
bones
shall
they
burn
upon
thee
Kings
And
gave
sign
the
same
day
saying
This
the
sign
which
Jehovah
hath
spoken
Behold
the
altar
shall
rent
and
the
ashes
that
are
upon
shall
poured
out
Kings
And
came
pass
when
the
king
heard
the
saying
the
man
God
which
cried
against
the
altar
Beth
that
Jeroboam
put
forth
his
hand
from
the
altar
saying
Lay
hold
him
And
his
hand
which
put
forth
against
him
dried
that
could
not
draw
back
again
him
Kings
The
altar
also
was
rent
and
the
ashes
poured
out
from
the
altar
according
the
sign
which
the
man
God
had
given
the
word
Jehovah
Kings
And
the
king
answered
and
said
unto
the
man
God
Entreat
now
the
favor
Jehovah
thy
God
and
pray
for
that
hand
may
restored
again
And
the
man
God
entreated
Jehovah
and
the
king
hand
was
restored
him
again
and
became
was
before
Kings
And
the
king
said
unto
the
man
God
Come
home
with
and
refresh
thyself
and
will
give
thee
reward
Kings
And
the
man
God
said
unto
the
king
thou
wilt
give
half
thy
house
will
not
with
thee
neither
will
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
this
place
Kings
for
was
charged
the
word
Jehovah
saying
Thou
shalt
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
neither
return
the
way
that
thou
camest
Kings
went
another
way
and
returned
not
the
way
that
came
Beth
Kings
Now
there
dwelt
old
prophet
Beth
and
one
his
sons
came
and
told
him
all
the
works
that
the
man
God
had
done
that
day
Beth
the
words
which
had
spoken
unto
the
king
them
also
they
told
unto
their
father
Kings
And
their
father
said
unto
them
What
way
went
Now
his
sons
had
seen
what
way
the
man
God
went
that
came
from
Judah
Kings
And
said
unto
his
sons
Saddle
the
ass
they
saddled
him
the
ass
and
rode
thereon
Kings
And
went
after
the
man
God
and
found
him
sitting
under
oak
and
said
unto
him
Art
thou
the
man
God
that
camest
from
Judah
And
said
Kings
Then
said
unto
him
Come
home
with
and
eat
bread
Kings
And
said
may
not
return
with
thee
nor
with
thee
neither
will
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
with
thee
this
place
Kings
for
was
said
the
word
Jehovah
Thou
shalt
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
there
nor
turn
again
the
way
that
thou
camest
Kings
And
said
unto
him
also
prophet
thou
art
and
angel
spake
unto
the
word
Jehovah
saying
Bring
him
back
with
thee
into
thy
house
that
may
eat
bread
and
drink
water
But
lied
unto
him
Kings
went
back
with
him
and
did
eat
bread
his
house
and
drank
water
Kings
And
came
pass
they
sat
the
table
that
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
the
prophet
that
brought
him
back
Kings
and
cried
unto
the
man
God
that
came
from
Judah
saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Forasmuch
thou
hast
been
disobedient
unto
the
mouth
Jehovah
and
hast
not
kept
the
commandment
which
Jehovah
thy
God
commanded
thee
Kings
but
camest
back
and
hast
eaten
bread
and
drunk
water
the
place
which
said
thee
Eat
bread
and
drink
water
thy
body
shall
not
come
unto
the
sepulchre
thy
fathers
Kings
And
came
pass
after
had
eaten
bread
and
after
had
drunk
that
saddled
for
him
the
ass
wit
for
the
prophet
whom
had
brought
back
Kings
And
when
was
gone
lion
met
him
the
way
and
slew
him
and
his
body
was
cast
the
way
and
the
ass
stood
the
lion
also
stood
the
body
Kings
And
behold
men
passed
and
saw
the
body
cast
the
way
and
the
lion
standing
the
body
and
they
came
and
told
the
city
where
the
old
prophet
dwelt
Kings
And
when
the
prophet
that
brought
him
back
from
the
way
heard
thereof
said
the
man
God
who
was
disobedient
unto
the
mouth
Jehovah
therefore
Jehovah
hath
delivered
him
unto
the
lion
which
hath
torn
him
and
slain
him
according
the
word
Jehovah
which
spake
unto
him
Kings
And
spake
his
sons
saying
Saddle
the
ass
And
they
saddled
Kings
And
went
and
found
his
body
cast
the
way
and
the
ass
and
the
lion
standing
the
body
the
lion
had
not
eaten
the
body
nor
torn
the
ass
Kings
And
the
prophet
took
the
body
the
man
God
and
laid
upon
the
ass
and
brought
back
and
came
the
city
the
old
prophet
mourn
and
bury
him
Kings
And
laid
his
body
his
own
grave
and
they
mourned
over
him
saying
Alas
brother
Kings
And
came
pass
after
had
buried
him
that
spake
his
sons
saying
When
dead
then
bury
the
sepulchre
wherein
the
man
God
buried
lay
bones
beside
his
bones
Kings
For
the
saying
which
cried
the
word
Jehovah
against
the
altar
Beth
and
against
all
the
houses
the
high
places
which
are
the
cities
Samaria
shall
surely
come
pass
Kings
After
this
thing
Jeroboam
returned
not
from
his
evil
way
but
made
again
from
among
all
the
people
priests
the
high
places
whosoever
would
consecrated
him
that
there
might
priests
the
high
places
Kings
And
this
thing
became
sin
unto
the
house
Jeroboam
even
cut
off
and
destroy
from
off
the
face
the
earth
Kings
that
time
Abijah
the
son
Jeroboam
fell
sick
Kings
And
Jeroboam
said
his
wife
Arise
pray
thee
and
disguise
thyself
that
thou
not
known
the
wife
Jeroboam
and
get
thee
Shiloh
behold
there
Ahijah
the
prophet
who
spake
concerning
that
should
king
over
this
people
Kings
And
take
with
thee
ten
loaves
and
cakes
and
cruse
honey
and
him
will
tell
thee
what
shall
become
the
child
Kings
And
Jeroboam
wife
did
and
arose
and
went
Shiloh
and
came
the
house
Ahijah
Now
Ahijah
could
not
see
for
his
eyes
were
set
reason
his
age
Kings
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Ahijah
Behold
the
wife
Jeroboam
cometh
inquire
thee
concerning
her
son
for
sick
thus
and
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
her
for
will
when
she
cometh
that
she
will
feign
herself
another
woman
Kings
And
was
when
Ahijah
heard
the
sound
her
feet
she
came
the
door
that
said
Come
thou
wife
Jeroboam
why
feignest
thou
thyself
another
for
sent
thee
with
heavy
tidings
Kings
tell
Jeroboam
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Forasmuch
exalted
thee
from
among
the
people
and
made
thee
prince
over
people
Israel
Kings
and
rent
the
kingdom
away
from
the
house
David
and
gave
thee
and
yet
thou
hast
not
been
servant
David
who
kept
commandments
and
who
followed
with
all
his
heart
that
only
which
was
right
mine
eyes
Kings
but
hast
done
evil
above
all
that
were
before
thee
and
hast
gone
and
made
thee
other
gods
and
molten
images
provoke
anger
and
hast
cast
behind
thy
back
Kings
therefore
behold
will
bring
evil
upon
the
house
Jeroboam
and
will
cut
off
from
Jeroboam
every
man
child
him
that
shut
and
him
that
left
large
Israel
and
will
utterly
sweep
away
the
house
Jeroboam
man
sweepeth
away
dung
till
all
gone
Kings
Him
that
dieth
Jeroboam
the
city
shall
the
dogs
eat
and
him
that
dieth
the
field
shall
the
birds
the
heavens
eat
for
Jehovah
hath
spoken
Kings
Arise
thou
therefore
get
thee
thy
house
and
when
thy
feet
enter
into
the
city
the
child
shall
die
Kings
And
all
Israel
shall
mourn
for
him
and
bury
him
for
only
Jeroboam
shall
come
the
grave
because
him
there
found
some
good
thing
toward
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
the
house
Jeroboam
Kings
Moreover
Jehovah
will
raise
him
king
over
Israel
who
shall
cut
off
the
house
Jeroboam
that
day
but
what
even
now
Kings
For
Jehovah
will
smite
Israel
reed
shaken
the
water
and
will
root
Israel
out
this
good
land
which
gave
their
fathers
and
will
scatter
them
beyond
the
River
because
they
have
made
their
Asherim
provoking
Jehovah
anger
Kings
And
will
give
Israel
because
the
sins
Jeroboam
which
hath
sinned
and
wherewith
hath
made
Israel
sin
Kings
And
Jeroboam
wife
arose
and
departed
and
came
Tirzah
and
she
came
the
threshold
the
house
the
child
died
Kings
And
all
Israel
buried
him
and
mourned
for
him
according
the
word
Jehovah
which
spake
his
servant
Ahijah
the
prophet
Kings
And
the
rest
the
acts
Jeroboam
how
warred
and
how
reigned
behold
they
are
written
the
book
the
chronicles
the
kings
Israel
Kings
And
the
days
which
Jeroboam
reigned
were
two
and
twenty
years
and
slept
with
his
fathers
and
Nadab
his
son
reigned
his
stead
Kings
And
Rehoboam
the
son
Solomon
reigned
Judah
Rehoboam
was
forty
and
one
years
old
when
began
reign
and
reigned
seventeen
years
Jerusalem
the
city
which
Jehovah
had
chosen
out
all
the
tribes
Israel
put
his
name
there
and
his
mother
name
was
Naamah
the
Ammonitess
Kings
And
Judah
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
and
they
provoked
him
jealousy
with
their
sins
which
they
committed
above
all
that
their
fathers
had
done
Kings
For
they
also
built
them
high
places
and
pillars
and
Asherim
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
Kings
and
there
were
also
sodomites
the
land
they
did
according
all
the
abominations
the
nations
which
Jehovah
drove
out
before
the
children
Israel
Kings
And
came
pass
the
fifth
year
king
Rehoboam
that
Shishak
king
Egypt
came
against
Jerusalem
Kings
and
took
away
the
treasures
the
house
Jehovah
and
the
treasures
the
king
house
even
took
away
all
and
took
away
all
the
shields
gold
which
Solomon
had
made
Kings
And
king
Rehoboam
made
their
stead
shields
brass
and
committed
them
the
hands
the
captains
the
guard
who
kept
the
door
the
king
house
Kings
And
was
that
oft
the
king
went
into
the
house
Jehovah
the
guard
bare
them
and
brought
them
back
into
the
guard
chamber
Kings
Now
the
rest
the
acts
Rehoboam
and
all
that
did
are
they
not
written
the
book
the
chronicles
the
kings
Judah
Kings
And
there
was
war
between
Rehoboam
and
Jeroboam
continually
Kings
And
Rehoboam
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
the
city
David
and
his
mother
name
was
Naamah
the
Ammonitess
And
Abijam
his
son
reigned
his
stead
Kings
Now
the
eighteenth
year
king
Jeroboam
the
son
Nebat
began
Abijam
reign
over
Judah
Kings
Three
years
reigned
Jerusalem
and
his
mother
name
was
Maacah
the
daughter
Abishalom
Kings
And
walked
all
the
sins
his
father
which
had
done
before
him
and
his
heart
was
not
perfect
with
Jehovah
his
God
the
heart
David
his
father
Kings
Nevertheless
for
David
sake
did
Jehovah
his
God
give
him
lamp
Jerusalem
set
his
son
after
him
and
establish
Jerusalem
Kings
because
David
did
that
which
was
right
the
eyes
Jehovah
and
turned
not
aside
from
anything
that
commanded
him
all
the
days
his
life
save
only
the
matter
Uriah
the
Hittite
Kings
Now
there
was
war
between
Rehoboam
and
Jeroboam
all
the
days
his
life
Kings
And
the
rest
the
acts
Abijam
and
all
that
did
are
they
not
written
the
book
the
chronicles
the
kings
Judah
And
there
was
war
between
Abijam
and
Jeroboam
Kings
And
Abijam
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
the
city
David
and
Asa
his
son
reigned
his
stead
Kings
And
the
twentieth
year
Jeroboam
king
Israel
began
Asa
reign
over
Judah
Kings
And
forty
and
one
years
reigned
Jerusalem
and
his
mother
name
was
Maacah
the
daughter
Abishalom
Kings
And
Asa
did
that
which
was
right
the
eyes
Jehovah
did
David
his
father
Kings
And
put
away
the
sodomites
out
the
land
and
removed
all
the
idols
that
his
fathers
had
made
Kings
And
also
Maacah
his
mother
removed
from
being
queen
because
she
had
made
abominable
image
for
Asherah
and
Asa
cut
down
her
image
and
burnt
the
brook
Kidron
Kings
But
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
nevertheless
the
heart
Asa
was
perfect
with
Jehovah
all
his
days
Kings
And
brought
into
the
house
Jehovah
the
things
that
his
father
had
dedicated
and
the
things
that
himself
had
dedicated
silver
and
gold
and
vessels
Kings
And
there
was
war
between
Asa
and
Baasha
king
Israel
all
their
days
Kings
And
Baasha
king
Israel
went
against
Judah
and
built
Ramah
that
might
not
suffer
any
one
out
come
Asa
king
Judah
Kings
Then
Asa
took
all
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
were
left
the
treasures
the
house
Jehovah
and
the
treasures
the
king
house
and
delivered
them
into
the
hand
his
servants
and
king
Asa
sent
them
Ben
hadad
the
son
Tabrimmon
the
son
Hezion
king
Syria
that
dwelt
Damascus
saying
Kings
There
league
between
and
thee
between
father
and
thy
father
behold
have
sent
unto
thee
present
silver
and
gold
break
thy
league
with
Baasha
king
Israel
that
may
depart
from
Kings
And
Ben
hadad
hearkened
unto
king
Asa
and
sent
the
captains
his
armies
against
the
cities
Israel
and
smote
Ijon
and
Dan
and
Abel
beth
maacah
and
all
Chinneroth
with
all
the
land
Naphtali
Kings
And
came
pass
when
Baasha
heard
thereof
that
left
off
building
Ramah
and
dwelt
Tirzah
Kings
Then
king
Asa
made
proclamation
unto
all
Judah
none
was
exempted
and
they
carried
away
the
stones
Ramah
and
the
timber
thereof
wherewith
Baasha
had
builded
and
king
Asa
built
therewith
Geba
Benjamin
and
Mizpah
Kings
Now
the
rest
all
the
acts
Asa
and
all
his
might
and
all
that
did
and
the
cities
which
built
are
they
not
written
the
book
the
chronicles
the
kings
Judah
But
the
time
his
old
age
was
diseased
his
feet
Kings
And
Asa
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
the
city
David
his
father
and
Jehoshaphat
his
son
reigned
his
stead
Kings
And
Nadab
the
son
Jeroboam
began
reign
over
Israel
the
second
year
Asa
king
Judah
and
reigned
over
Israel
two
years
Kings
And
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
and
walked
the
way
his
father
and
his
sin
wherewith
made
Israel
sin
Kings
And
Baasha
the
son
Ahijah
the
house
Issachar
conspired
against
him
and
Baasha
smote
him
Gibbethon
which
belonged
the
Philistines
for
Nadab
and
all
Israel
were
laying
siege
Gibbethon
Kings
Even
the
third
year
Asa
king
Judah
did
Baasha
slay
him
and
reigned
his
stead
Kings
And
came
pass
that
soon
was
king
smote
all
the
house
Jeroboam
left
not
Jeroboam
any
that
breathed
until
had
destroyed
him
according
unto
the
saying
Jehovah
which
spake
his
servant
Ahijah
the
Shilonite
Kings
for
the
sins
Jeroboam
which
sinned
and
wherewith
made
Israel
sin
because
his
provocation
wherewith
provoked
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
anger
Kings
Now
the
rest
the
acts
Nadab
and
all
that
did
are
they
not
written
the
book

Israel
Kings
And
there
was
war
between
Asa
and
Baasha
king
Israel
all
their
days
Kings
the
third
year
Asa
king
Judah
began
Baasha
the
son
Ahijah
reign
over
all
Israel
Tirzah
and
reigned
twenty
and
four
years
Kings
And
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
and
walked
the
way
Jeroboam
and
his
sin
wherewith
made
Israel
sin
Kings
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
Jehu
the
son
Hanani
against
Baasha
saying
Kings
Forasmuch
exalted
thee
out
the
dust
and
made
thee
prince
over
people
Israel
and
thou
hast
walked
the
way
Jeroboam
and
hast
made
people
Israel
sin
provoke
anger
with
their
sins
Kings
behold
will
utterly
sweep
away
Baasha
and
his
house
and
will
make
thy
house
like
the
house
Jeroboam
the
son
Nebat
Kings
Him
that
dieth
Baasha
the
city
shall
the
dogs
eat
and
him
that
dieth
his
the
field
shall
the
birds
the

eat
Kings
Now
the
rest
the
acts
Baasha
and
what
did
and
his
might
are
they
not
written
the
book

Israel
Kings
And
Baasha
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
Tirzah
and
Elah
his
son
reigned
his
stead
Kings
And
moreover
the
prophet
Jehu
the
son
Hanani
came
the
word
Jehovah
against
Baasha
and
against
his
house
both
because
all
the
evil
that
did
the
sight
Jehovah
provoke
him
anger
with
the
work
his
hands
being
like
the
house
Jeroboam
and
because
smote
him
Kings
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
Asa
king
Judah
began
Elah
the
son
Baasha
reign
over
Israel
Tirzah
and
reigned
two
years
Kings
And
his
servant
Zimri
captain
half
his
chariots
conspired
against
him
Now
was
Tirzah
drinking
himself
drunk
the
house
Arza
who
was
over
the
household
Tirzah
Kings
and
Zimri
went
and
smote
him
and
killed
him
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
Asa
king
Judah
and
reigned
his
stead
Kings
And
came
pass
when
began
reign
soon
sat
his
throne
that
smote
all
the
house
Baasha
left
him
not
single
man
child
neither
his
kinsfolks
nor
his
friends
Kings
Thus
did
Zimri
destroy
all
the
house
Baasha
according
the
word
Jehovah
which
spake
against
Baasha
Jehu
the
prophet
Kings
for
all
the
sins
Baasha
and
the
sins
Elah
his
son
which
they
sinned
and
wherewith
they
made
Israel
sin
provoke
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
anger
with
their
vanities
Kings
Now
the
rest
the

Elah
and
all
that
did
are
they
not

the
kings
Israel
Kings
the
twenty

Asa

Judah
did
Zimri
reign
seven
days
Tirzah
Now
the
people
were
encamped
against
Gibbethon
which
belonged
the
Philistines
Kings
And
the
people
that
were
encamped
heard
say
Zimri
hath
conspired
and
hath
also
smitten
the
king
wherefore
all
Israel
made
Omri
the
captain
the
host
king
over
Israel
that
day
the
camp
Kings
And
Omri
went
from
Gibbethon
and
all
Israel
with
him
and
they
besieged
Tirzah
Kings
And
came
pass
when
Zimri
saw
that
the
city
was
taken
that
went
into
the
castle
the
king
house
and
burnt
the
king
house
over
him
with
fire
and
died
Kings
for
his
sins
which
sinned
doing
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
walking
the
way
Jeroboam
and
his
sin
which
did
make
Israel
sin
Kings
Now

the
acts
Zimri
and
his
treason
that
wrought
are

Then
were
the
people
Israel
divided
into
two
parts
half
the
people
followed
Tibni
the
son
Ginath
make
him
king
and
half
followed
Omri
Kings
But
the
people
that
followed
Omri
prevailed
against
the

that
followed
Tibni
the

Ginath
Tibni
died

and
reigned
twelve
years

And
bought
the
hill
Samaria
Shemer
for
two
talents
silver

built
the
hill
and
called
the
name
the
city
which
built
after
the
name
Shemer
the
owner
the
hill
Samaria
Kings
And
Omri
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
and
dealt
wickedly
above
all
that
were
before
him
Kings
For
walked
all
the
way
Jeroboam
the
son
Nebat
and
his
sins
wherewith
made
Israel
sin
provoke
Jehovah
the
God
Israel

and
carried
him
into
the
chamber
where

And

unto
Jehovah
and
said
Jehovah
God
hast
thou
also
brought

And

three
times
and
cried
unto
Jehovah
and
said
Jehovah
God
pray
thee
let
this
child
soul
come

And
Jehovah
hearkened
unto
the
voice
Elijah
and
the

And
Elijah
took

himself
unto
Ahab
And
the
famine
was
sore
Samaria
Kings
And
Ahab
called
Obadiah
who
was
over
the
household
Now
Obadiah
feared
Jehovah
greatly
Kings
for
was
when
Jezebel
cut
off
the
prophets
Jehovah
that
Obadiah
took
hundred
prophets
and
hid
them
fifty
cave
and
fed
them
with
bread
and
water
Kings
And
Ahab
said
unto
Obadiah

and
unto
all
the
brooks
peradventure

went
one
way
himself
and

went
another
way
himself
Kings
And
Obadiah
was
the
way
behold
Elijah
met
him
and
knew
him
and
fell
his
face
and
said
thou
lord
Elijah
Kings
And
answered
him
tell
thy
lord
Behold
Elijah
here
Kings
And
said
Wherein
have
sinned
that
thou
wouldest
deliver
thy
servant
into
the
hand
Ahab
slay
Kings
Jehovah
thy
God
liveth
there
nation
kingdom
whither
lord
hath
not
sent
seek
thee
and
when
they
said
not
here
took
oath
the
kingdom
and
nation
that
they
found
thee
not
Kings
And
now
thou
sayest
tell
thy
lord
Behold
Elijah
here
Kings
And
will
come
pass
soon
gone
from
thee
that
the
Spirit
Jehovah
will
carry
thee
whither

Was

slew
the
prophets
Jehovah
how
hid
hundred
men
Jehovah
prophets
fifty
cave
and
fed
them
with
bread
and
water
Kings
And
now
thou
sayest
tell
thy
lord
Behold
Elijah
here
and
will
slay
Kings
And
Elijah
said
Jehovah
hosts
liveth
before
whom
stand
will
surely
show
myself
unto
him
day
Kings
Obadiah
went
meet
Ahab
and
told
him
and
Ahab
went
meet
Elijah
Kings
And
came
pass
when
Ahab
saw
Elijah
that
Ahab
said
unto
him
thou
thou
troubler
Israel
Kings
And
answered
have
not
troubled
Israel
but
thou
and
thy
father
house
that
have
forsaken
the
commandments
Jehovah
and
thou
hast
followed
the
Baalim
Kings
Now
therefore
send
and
gather
all
Israel
unto
mount
Carmel
and
the
prophets
Baal
four
hundred
and
fifty
and
the
prophets
the
Asherah
four
hundred
that
eat
Jezebel
table
Kings
Ahab
sent
unto
all
the
children
Israel
and
gathered
the
prophets
together
unto
mount
Carmel
Kings
And
Elijah
came
near
unto
all
the
people
and
said
How
long
limping
between
the
two
sides
Jehovah
God
follow
him
but
Baal
then
follow
him
And
the
people
answered
him
not
word
Kings
Then
said
Elijah
unto
the
people
even
only
left
prophet
Jehovah
but
Baal
prophets
are
four
hundred
and
fifty
men
Kings
Let
them
therefore
give
two
bullocks
and
let
them
choose
one
bullock
for
themselves
and
cut
pieces
and
lay
the
wood
and
put
fire
under
and
will
dress
the
other
bullock
and
lay
the
wood
and
put
fire
under
Kings
And
call
the
name
your
god
and
will
call
the
name
Jehovah
and
the
God
that
answereth
fire
let
him
God
And
all
the
people
answered
and
said
well
spoken
Kings
And
Elijah
said
unto
the
prophets
Baal
Choose
you
one
bullock
for
yourselves
and
dress
first
for
are
many
and
call
the
name
your
god
but
put
fire
under
Kings
And
they
took
the
bullock
which
was
given
them
and
they
dressed
and
called
the
name
Baal
from
morning
even
until
noon
saying
Baal
hear
But
there
was
voice
nor
any
that
answered
And
they
leaped
about
the
altar
which
was
made
Kings
And
came
pass
noon
that
Elijah
mocked
them
and
said
Cry
aloud
for
god
either
musing
gone
aside
journey
peradventure
sleepeth
and
must
awaked
Kings
And
they
cried
aloud
and
cut
themselves
after
their
manner
with
knives
and
lances
till
the
blood
gushed
out
upon
them
Kings
And
was
when
midday
was
past
that
they
prophesied
until
the
time
the
offering
the
evening
oblation
but
there
was
neither
voice
nor
any
answer
nor
any
that
regarded
Kings
And
Elijah
said
unto
all
the
people
Come
near
unto
and
all
the
people
came
near
unto
him
And
repaired
the
altar
Jehovah
that
was
thrown
down
Kings
And
Elijah
took
twelve
stones
according
the
number
the
tribes
the
sons
Jacob
unto
whom
the
word
Jehovah
came
saying
Israel
shall
thy
name
Kings
And
with
the
stones
built
altar
the
name
Jehovah
and
made
trench
about
the
altar
great
would
contain
two
measures
seed
Kings
And
put
the
wood
order
and
cut
the
bullock
pieces
and
laid
the
wood
And
said
Fill
four
jars
with
water
and
pour
the
burnt
offering
and
the
wood
Kings
And
said
the
second
time
and
they
did
the
second
time
And
said
the
third
time
and
they
did
the
third
time
Kings
And
the
water
ran
round
about
the
altar
and
filled
the
trench
also
with
water
Kings
And
came
pass
the
time
the
offering
the
evening
oblation
that
Elijah
the
prophet
came
near
and
said
Jehovah
the
God
Abraham
Isaac
and
Israel
let
known
this
day
that
thou
art
God
Israel
and
that
thy
servant
and
that
have
done
all
these
things
thy
word
Kings
Hear
Jehovah
hear
that
this
people
may
know
that
thou
Jehovah
art
God
and
that
thou
hast
turned
their
heart
back
again
Kings
Then
the
fire
Jehovah
fell
and
consumed
the
burnt
offering
and
the
wood
and
the
stones
and
the
dust
and
licked
the
water
that
was
the
trench
Kings
And
when
all
the
people
saw
they
fell
their
faces
and
they
said
Jehovah
God
Jehovah
God
Kings
And
Elijah
said
unto
them
Take
the
prophets
Baal
let
not
one
them
escape
And
they
took
them
and
Elijah
brought
them
down
the
brook
Kishon
and
slew
them
there
Kings
And
Elijah
said
unto
Ahab
Get
thee
eat
and
drink
for
there
the
sound
abundance
rain
Kings
Ahab
went
eat
and
drink
And
Elijah
went
the
top
Carmel
and
bowed
himself
down
upon
the
earth
and
put
his
face
between
his
knees
Kings
And
said
his
servant
now
look
toward
the
sea
And
went
and
looked
and
said
There
nothing
And
said
again
seven
times
Kings
And
came
pass
the
seventh
time
that
said
Behold
there
ariseth
cloud
out
the
sea
small
man
hand
And
said
say
unto
Ahab
Make
ready
thy
chariot
and
get
thee
down
that
the
rain
stop
thee
not
Kings
And
came
pass
little
while
that
the
heavens
grew
black
with
clouds
and
wind
and
there
was
great
rain
And
Ahab
rode
and
went
Jezreel
Kings
and
the
hand
Jehovah
was
Elijah
and
girded
his
loins
and
ran
before
Ahab
the
entrance
Jezreel
Kings
And
Ahab
told
Jezebel
all
that
Elijah
had
done
and
withal
how
had
slain
all
the
prophets
with
the
sword
Kings
Then
Jezebel
sent
messenger
unto
Elijah
saying
let
the
gods
and
more
also
make
not
thy
life
the
life
one
them
morrow
about
this
time
Kings
And
when
saw
that
arose
and
went
for
his
life
and
came
Beer
sheba
which
belongeth
Judah
and
left
his
servant
there
Kings
But
himself
went
day
journey
into
the
wilderness
and
came
and
sat
down
under
juniper
tree
and
requested
for
himself
that
might
die
and
said
enough
now
Jehovah
take
away
life
for
not
better
than
fathers
Kings
And
lay
down
and
slept
under
juniper
tree
and
behold
angel
touched
him
and
said
unto
him
Arise
and
eat
Kings
And
looked
and
behold
there
was
his
head
cake
baken
the
coals
and
cruse
water
And
did
eat
and
drink
and
laid
him
down
again
Kings
And
the
angel
Jehovah
came
again
the
second
time
and
touched
him
and
said
Arise
and
eat
because
the
journey
too
great
for
thee
Kings
And
arose
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
went
the
strength
that
food
forty
days
and
forty
nights
unto
Horeb
the
mount
God
Kings
And
came
thither
unto
cave
and
lodged
there
and
behold
the
word
Jehovah
came
him
and
said
unto
him
What
doest
thou
here
Elijah
Kings
And
said
have
been
very
jealous
for
Jehovah
the
God
hosts
for
the
children
Israel
have
forsaken
thy
covenant
thrown
down
thine
altars
and
slain
thy
prophets
with
the
sword
and
even
only
left
and
they
seek
life
take
away
Kings
And
said
forth
and
stand
upon
the
mount
before
Jehovah
And
behold
Jehovah
passed
and
great
and
strong
wind
rent
the
mountains
and
brake
pieces
the
rocks
before
Jehovah
but
Jehovah
was
not
the
wind
and
after
the
wind
earthquake
but
Jehovah
was
not
the
earthquake
Kings
and
after
the
earthquake
fire
but
Jehovah
was
not
the
fire
and
after
the
fire
still
small
voice
Kings
And
was
when
Elijah
heard
that
wrapped
his
face
his
mantle
and
went
out
and
stood
the
entrance
the
cave
And
behold
there
came
voice
unto
him
and
said
What
doest
thou
here
Elijah
Kings
And
said
have
been
very
jealous
for
Jehovah
the
God
hosts
for
the
children
Israel
have
forsaken
thy
covenant
thrown
down
thine
altars
and
slain
thy
prophets
with
the
sword
and
even
only
left
and
they
seek
life
take
away
Kings
And
Jehovah
said
unto
him
return
thy
way
the
wilderness
Damascus
and
when
thou
comest
thou
shalt
anoint
Hazael
king
over
Syria
Kings
and
Jehu
the
son
Nimshi
shalt
thou
anoint
king
over
Israel
and
Elisha
the
son
Shaphat
Abel
meholah
shalt
thou
anoint
prophet
thy
room
Kings
And
shall
come
pass
that
him
that
escapeth
from
the
sword
Hazael
shall
Jehu
slay
and
him
that
escapeth
from
the
sword
Jehu
shall
Elisha
slay
Kings
Yet
will
leave
seven
thousand
Israel
all
the
knees
which
have
not
bowed
unto
Baal
and
every
mouth
which
hath
not
kissed
him
Kings
departed
thence
and
found
Elisha
the
son
Shaphat
who
was
plowing
with
twelve
yoke
oxen
before
him
and
with
the
twelfth
and
Elijah
passed
over
unto
him
and
cast
his
mantle
upon
him
Kings
And
left
the
oxen
and
ran
after
Elijah
and
said
Let
pray
thee
kiss
father
and
mother
and
then
will
follow
thee
And
said
unto
him
back
again
for
what
have
done
thee
Kings
And
returned
from
following
him
and
took
the
yoke
oxen
and
slew
them
and
boiled
their
flesh
with
the
instruments
the
oxen
and
gave
unto
the
people
and
they
did
eat
Then
arose
and
went
after
Elijah
and
ministered
unto
him
Kings
And
Ben
hadad
the
king
Syria
gathered
all
his
host
together
and
there
were
thirty
and
two
kings
with
him
and
the
horses
and
the
chariots
and
went
and
besieged
Samaria
and
fought
against
Kings
And
sent
messengers
Ahab
king
Israel
into
the
city
and
said
unto
him
Thus
saith
Ben
hadad
Kings
Thy
silver
and
thy
gold
mine
thy
wives
also
and
thy
children
even
the
goodliest
are
mine
Kings
And
the
king
Israel
answered
and
said
according
thy
saying
lord
king
thine
and
all
that
have
Kings
And
the
messengers
came
again
and
said
Thus
speaketh
Ben
hadad
saying
sent
indeed
unto
thee
saying
Thou
shalt
deliver
thy
silver
and
thy
gold
and
thy
wives
and
thy
children
Kings
but
will
send
servants
unto
thee

about
this
time
and
they
shall
search
thy
house
and
the
houses
thy
servants
and
shall
that
whatsoever
pleasant
thine
eyes
they
shall
put
their
hand
and
take
away
Kings
Then
the
king
Israel
called
all
the
elders
the
land
and
said
Mark
pray
you
and
see
how
this
man
seeketh
mischief
for
sent
unto
for
wives
and
for
children
and
for
silver
and
for
gold
and
denied
him
not
Kings
And
all
the
elders
and
all
the
people
said
unto
him
Hearken
thou
not
neither
consent
Kings
Wherefore
said
unto
the
messengers
Ben
hadad
Tell
lord
the
king
All
that
thou
didst
send
for
thy
servant
the
first
will
but
this
thing
may
not
And
the
messengers
departed
and
brought
him
word
again
Kings
And
Ben
hadad
sent
unto
him
and
said
The
gods
unto
and
more
also
the
dust
Samaria
shall
suffice
for
handfuls
for
all
the
people
that
follow
Kings
And
the
king
Israel
answered
and
said
Tell
him
Let
not
him
that
girdeth
his
armor
boast
himself
that
putteth
off
Kings
And
came
pass
when
Ben
hadad
heard
this
message
was
drinking
and
the
kings
the
pavilions
that
said
unto
his
servants
Set
yourselves
array
And
they
set
themselves
array
against
the
city
Kings
And
behold
prophet
came
near
unto
Ahab
king
Israel
and
said
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Hast
thou
seen
all
this
great
multitude
behold
will
deliver
into
thy
hand
this
day
and
thou
shalt
know
that
Jehovah
Kings
And
Ahab
said
whom
And
said
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
young
men
the
princes
the
provinces
Then
said
Who
shall
begin
the
battle
And
answered
Thou
Kings
Then
mustered
the
young
men
the
princes
the
provinces
and
they
were
two
hundred
and
thirty
two
and
after
them
mustered
all
the
people
even
all
the
children
Israel
being
seven
thousand
Kings
And
they
went
out
noon
But
Ben
hadad
was
drinking
himself
drunk
the
pavilions
and
the
kings
the
thirty
and
two
kings
that
helped
him
Kings
And
the
young
men
the
princes
the
provinces
went
out
first
and
Ben
hadad
sent
out
and
they
told
him
saying
There
are
men
come
out
from
Samaria
Kings
And
said
Whether
they
are
come
out
for
peace
take
them
alive
whether
they
are
come
out
for
war
taken
them
alive
Kings
these
went
out
the
city
the
young
men
the
princes
the
provinces
and
the
army
which
followed
them
Kings
And
they
slew
every
one
his
man
and
the
Syrians
fled
and
Israel
pursued
them
and
Ben
hadad
the
king
Syria
escaped
horse
with
horsemen
Kings
And
the
king
Israel
went
out
and
smote
the
horses
and
chariots
and
slew
the
Syrians
with
great
slaughter
Kings
And
the
prophet
came
near
the
king
Israel
and
said
unto
him
strengthen
thyself
and
mark
and
see
what
thou
doest
for
the
return
the
year
the
king
Syria
will
come
against
thee
Kings
And
the
servants
the
king
Syria
said
unto
him
Their
god
god
the
hills
therefore
they
were
stronger
than
but
let
fight
against
them
the
plain
and
surely
shall
stronger
than
they
Kings
And
this
thing
take
the
kings
away
every
man
out
his
place
and
put
captains
their
room
Kings
and
number
thee
army
like
the
army
that
thou
hast
lost
horse
for
horse
and
chariot
for
chariot
and
will
fight
against
them
the
plain
and
surely
shall
stronger
than
they
And
hearkened
unto
their
voice
and
did
Kings
And
came
pass
the
return
the
year
that
Ben
hadad
mustered
the
Syrians
and
went
Aphek
fight
against
Israel
Kings
And
the
children
Israel
were
mustered
and
were
victualled
and
went
against
them
and
the
children
Israel
encamped
before
them
like
two
little
flocks
kids
but
the
Syrians
filled
the
country
Kings
And
man
God
came
near
and
spake
unto
the
king
Israel
and
said
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Because
the
Syrians
have
said
Jehovah
god
the
hills
but
not
god
the
valleys
therefore
will
deliver
all
this
great
multitude
into
thy
hand
and
shall
know
that
Jehovah
Kings
And
they
encamped
one
over
against
the
other
seven
days
And
was
that
the
seventh
day
the
battle
was
joined
and
the
children
Israel
slew
the
Syrians
hundred
thousand
footmen
one
day
Kings
But
the
rest
fled
Aphek
into
the
city
and
the
wall
fell
upon
twenty
and
seven
thousand
men
that
were
left
And
Ben
hadad
fled
and
came
into
the
city
into
inner
chamber
Kings
And
his
servants
said
unto
him
Behold
now
have
heard
that
the
kings
the
house
Israel
are
merciful
kings
let
pray
thee
put
sackcloth
our
loins
and
ropes
upon
our
heads
and
out
the
king
Israel
peradventure
will
save
thy
life
Kings
they
girded
sackcloth
their
loins
and
put
ropes
their
heads
and
came
the
king
Israel
and
said
Thy
servant
Ben
hadad
saith
pray
thee
let
live
And
said
yet
alive
brother
Kings
Now
the
men
observed
diligently
and
hasted
catch
whether
were
his
mind
and
they
said
Thy
brother
Ben
hadad
Then
said
bring
him
Then
Ben
hadad
came
forth
him
and
caused
him
come
into
the
chariot
Kings
And
Ben
hadad
said
unto
him
The
cities
which
father
took
from
thy
father
will
restore
and
thou
shalt
make
streets
for
thee
Damascus
father
made
Samaria
And
said
Ahab
will
let
thee
with
this
covenant
made
covenant
with
him
and
let
him
Kings
And
certain
man
the
sons
the
prophets
said
unto
his
fellow
the
word
Jehovah
Smite
pray
thee
And
the
man
refused
smite
him
Kings
Then
said
unto
him
Because
thou
hast
not
obeyed
the
voice
Jehovah
behold
soon
thou
art
departed
from
lion
shall
slay
thee
And
soon
was
departed
from
him
lion
found
him
and
slew
him
Kings
Then
found
another
man
and
said
Smite
pray
thee
And
the
man
smote
him
smiting
and
wounding
him
Kings
the
prophet
departed
and
waited
for
the
king
the
way
and
disguised
himself
with
his
headband
over
his
eyes
Kings
And
the
king
passed
cried
unto
the
king
and
said
Thy
servant
went
out
into
the
midst
the
battle
and
behold
man
turned
aside
and
brought
man
unto
and
said
Keep
this
man
any
means
missing
then
shall
thy
life
for
his
life
else
thou
shalt
pay
talent
silver
Kings
And
thy
servant
was
busy
here
and
there
was
gone
And
the
king
Israel
said
unto
him
shall
thy
judgment
thyself
hast
decided
Kings
And
hasted
and
took
the
headband
away
from
his
eyes
and
the
king
Israel
discerned
him
that
was
the
prophets
Kings
And
said
unto
him
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Because
thou
hast
let
out
thy
hand
the
man
whom
had
devoted
destruction
therefore
thy
life
shall
for
his
life
and
thy
people
for
his
people
Kings
And
the
king
Israel
went
his
house
heavy
and
displeased
and
came
Samaria
Kings
And
came
pass
after
these
things
that
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
had
vineyard
which
was
Jezreel
hard
the
palace
Ahab
king
Samaria
Kings
And
Ahab
spake
unto
Naboth
saying
Give
thy
vineyard
that

have

garden
herbs
because
near
unto
house
and
will
give
thee
for
better
vineyard
than
seem
good
thee
will
give
thee
the
worth
money
Kings
And
Naboth
said
Ahab
Jehovah
forbid
that
should
give
the
inheritance
fathers
unto
thee
Kings
And
Ahab
came
into
his
house
heavy
and
displeased
because
the
word
which
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
had
spoken
him
for
had
said
will
not
give
thee
the
inheritance
fathers
And
laid
him
down
upon
his
bed
and
turned
away
his
face
and
would
eat
bread
Kings
But
Jezebel
his
wife
came
him
and
said
unto
him
Why
thy
spirit
sad
that
thou
eatest
bread
Kings
And
said
unto
her
Because
spake
unto
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
and
said
unto
him
Give
thy
vineyard
for
money
else
please
thee
will
give
thee
another
vineyard
for
and
answered
will
not
give
thee
vineyard
Kings
And
Jezebel
his
wife
said
unto
him
Dost
thou
now
govern
the
kingdom
Israel
arise
and
eat
bread
and
let
thy
heart
merry
will
give
thee
the
vineyard
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
Kings
she
wrote
letters
Ahab
name
and
sealed
them
with
his
seal
and
sent
the
letters
unto
the
elders
and
the
nobles
that
were
his
city
and
that
dwelt
with
Naboth
Kings
And
she
wrote
the
letters
saying
Proclaim
fast
and
set
Naboth
high
among
the
people
Kings
and
set
two
men
base
fellows
before
him
and
let
them
bear
witness
against
him
saying
Thou
didst
curse
God
and
the
king
And
then
carry
him
out
and
stone
him
death
Kings
And
the
men
his
city
even
the
elders
and
the
nobles
who
dwelt
his
city
did
Jezebel
had
sent
unto
them
according
was
written
the
letters
which
she
had
sent
unto
them
Kings
They
proclaimed
fast
and
set
Naboth
high
among
the
people
Kings
And
the
two
men
the
base
fellows
came
and
sat
before
him
and
the
base
fellows
bare
witness
against
him
even
against
Naboth
the
presence
the
people
saying
Naboth
did
curse
God
and
the
king
Then
they
carried
him
forth
out
the
city
and
stoned
him
death
with
stones
Kings
Then
they
sent
Jezebel
saying
Naboth
stoned
and
dead
Kings
And
came
pass
when
Jezebel
heard
that
Naboth
was
stoned
and
was
dead
that
Jezebel
said
Ahab
Arise
take
possession
the
vineyard
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
which
refused
give
thee
for
money
for
Naboth
not
alive
but
dead
Kings
And
came
pass
when
Ahab
heard
that
Naboth
was
dead
that
Ahab
rose
down
the
vineyard
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
take
possession
Kings
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
Elijah
the
Tishbite
saying
Kings
Arise
down
meet
Ahab
king
Israel
who
dwelleth
Samaria
behold
the
vineyard
Naboth
whither
gone
down
take
possession
Kings
And
thou
shalt
speak
unto
him
saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Hast
thou
killed
and
also
taken
possession
And
thou
shalt
speak
unto
him
saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
place
where
dogs
licked
the
blood
Naboth
shall
dogs
lick
thy
blood
even
thine
Kings
And
Ahab
said
Elijah
Hast
thou
found
mine
enemy
And
answered
have
found
thee
because
thou
hast
sold
thyself
that
which
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
Kings
Behold
will
bring
evil
upon
thee
and
will
utterly
sweep
thee
away
and
will
cut
off
from
Ahab
every
man
child
and
him
that
shut
and
him
that
left
large
Israel
Kings
and
will
make
thy
house
like
the
house
Jeroboam
the
son
Nebat
and
like
the
house
Baasha
the
son
Ahijah
for
the
provocation
wherewith
thou
hast
provoked
anger
and
hast
made
Israel
sin
Kings
And
Jezebel
also
spake
Jehovah
saying
The
dogs
shall
eat
Jezebel
the
rampart
Jezreel
Kings
Him
that
dieth
Ahab
the
city
the
dogs
shall
eat
and
him
that
dieth
the
field
shall
the
birds
the
heavens
eat
Kings
But
there
was
none
like
unto
Ahab
who
did
sell
himself
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
whom
Jezebel
his
wife
stirred
Kings
And
did
very
abominably
following
idols
according
all
that
the
Amorites
did
whom
Jehovah
cast
out
before
the
children
Israel
Kings
And
came
pass
when
Ahab
heard
those
words
that
rent
his
clothes
and
put
sackcloth
upon
his
flesh
and
fasted
and
lay
sackcloth
and
went
softly
Kings
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
Elijah
the
Tishbite
saying
Kings
Seest
thou
how
Ahab
humbleth
himself
before
because
humbleth
himself
before
will
not
bring
the
evil
his
days
but
his
son
days
will
bring
the
evil
upon
his
house
Kings
And
they
continued
three
years
without
war
between
Syria
and
Israel
Kings
And
came
pass
the
third
year
that
Jehoshaphat
the
king
Judah
came
down
the
king
Israel
Kings
And
the
king
Israel
said
unto
his
servants
Know
that
Ramoth
gilead
ours
and
are
still
and
take
not
out
the
hand
the
king
Syria
Kings
And
said
unto
Jehoshaphat
Wilt
thou
with
battle
Ramoth
gilead
And
Jehoshaphat
said
the
king
Israel
thou
art
people
thy
people
horses
thy
horses
Kings
And
Jehoshaphat
said
unto
the
king
Israel
Inquire
first
pray
thee
for
the
word
Jehovah
Kings
Then
the
king
Israel
gathered
the
prophets
together
about
four
hundred
men
and
said
unto
them
Shall
against
Ramoth
gilead
battle
shall
forbear
And
they
said
for
the
Lord
will
deliver
into
the
hand
the
king
Kings
But
Jehoshaphat
said
there
not
here
prophet
Jehovah
besides
that
may
inquire
him
Kings
And
the
king
Israel
said
unto
Jehoshaphat
There
yet
one
man
whom
may
inquire
Jehovah
Micaiah
the
son
Imlah
but
hate
him
for
doth
not
prophesy
good
concerning
but
evil
And
Jehoshaphat
said
Let
not
the
king
say
Kings
Then
the
king
Israel
called
officer
and
said
Fetch
quickly
Micaiah
the
son
Imlah
Kings
Now
the
king
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
the
king
Judah
were
sitting
each
his
throne
arrayed
their
robes
open
place
the
entrance
the
gate
Samaria
and
all
the
prophets
were
prophesying
before
them
Kings
And
Zedekiah
the
son
Chenaanah
made
him
horns
iron
and
said
Thus
saith
Jehovah
With
these
shalt
thou
push
the
Syrians
until
they
consumed
Kings
And
all
the
prophets
prophesied
saying
Ramoth
gilead
and
prosper
for
Jehovah
will
deliver
into
the
hand
the
king
Kings
And
the
messenger
that
went
call
Micaiah
spake
unto
him
saying
Behold
now
the
words
the
prophets
declare
good
unto
the
king
with
one
mouth
let
thy
word
pray
thee
like
the
word
one
them
and
speak
thou
good
Kings
And
Micaiah
said
Jehovah
liveth
what
Jehovah
saith
unto
that
will
speak
Kings
And
when
was
come
the
king
the
king
said
unto
him
Micaiah
shall
Ramoth
gilead
battle
shall
forbear
And
answered
him
and
prosper
and
Jehovah
will
deliver
into
the
hand
the
king
Kings
And
the
king
said
unto
him
How
many
times
shall
adjure
thee
that
thou
speak
unto
nothing
but
the
truth
the
name
Jehovah
Kings
And
said
saw
all
Israel
scattered
upon
the
mountains
sheep
that
have
shepherd
and
Jehovah
said
These
have
master
let
them
return
every
man
his
house
peace
Kings
And
the
king
Israel
said
Jehoshaphat
Did
not
tell
thee
that
would
not
prophesy
good
concerning
but
evil
Kings
And
Micaiah
said
Therefore
hear
thou
the
word
Jehovah
saw
Jehovah
sitting
his
throne
and
all
the
host
heaven
standing
him
his
right
hand
and
his
left
Kings
And
Jehovah
said
Who
shall
entice
Ahab
that
may
and
fall
Ramoth
gilead
And
one
said
this
manner
and
another
said
that
manner
Kings
And
there
came
forth
spirit
and
stood
before
Jehovah
and
said
will
entice
him
Kings
And
Jehovah
said
unto
him
Wherewith
And
said
will
forth
and
will
lying
spirit
the
mouth
all
his
prophets
And
said
Thou
shalt
entice
him
and
shalt
prevail
also
forth
and
Kings
Now
therefore
behold
Jehovah
hath
put
lying
spirit
the
mouth
all
these
thy
prophets
and
Jehovah
hath
spoken
evil
concerning
thee
Kings
Then
Zedekiah
the
son
Chenaanah
came
near
and
smote
Micaiah
the
cheek
and
said
Which
way
went
the
Spirit
Jehovah
from
speak
unto
thee
Kings
And
Micaiah
said
Behold
thou
shalt
see
that
day
when
thou
shalt
into
inner
chamber
hide
thyself
Kings
And
the
king
Israel
said
Take
Micaiah
and
carry
him
back
unto
Amon
the
governor
the
city
and
Joash
the
king
son
Kings
and
say
Thus
saith
the
king
Put
this
fellow
the
prison
and
feed
him
with
bread
affliction
and
with
water
affliction
until
come
peace
Kings
And
Micaiah
said
thou
return
all
peace
Jehovah
hath
not
spoken
And
said
Hear
peoples
all
you
Kings
the
king
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
the
king
Judah
went
Ramoth
gilead
Kings
And
the
king
Israel
said
unto
Jehoshaphat
will
disguise
myself
and
into
the
battle
but
put
thou
thy
robes
And
the
king
Israel
disguised
himself
and
went
into
the
battle
Kings
Now
the
king
Syria
had
commanded
the
thirty
and
two
captains
his
chariots
saying
Fight
neither
with
small
nor
great
save
only
with
the
king
Israel
Kings
And
came
pass
when
the
captains
the
chariots
saw
Jehoshaphat
that
they
said
Surely
the
king
Israel
and
they
turned
aside
fight
against
him
and
Jehoshaphat
cried
out
Kings
And
came
pass
when
the
captains
the
chariots

And

armor
wherefore
said
unto
the
driver

chariot
Turn
thy

And
the
battle
increased
that
day
and
the

was
stayed

chariot
against
the
Syrians
and
died
even
and
the
blood
ran

Kings
And
there
went

throughout
the

saying
Every

every
man

And

And

And
Elijah

And
the

returned
unto

and
said
unto

Why

And
they
said
unto
him
There

And

And

And

And

Kings
And
said
unto
him
Thus

Jehovah
Forasmuch

And

Now
the

And
came
pass
when
Jehovah
would
take
Elijah
whirlwind
into
heaven
that
Elijah
went
with
Elisha
from
Gilgal
Kings
And
Elijah
said
unto
Elisha
Tarry
here
pray
thee
for
Jehovah
hath
sent
far
Beth
And
Elisha
said
Jehovah
liveth
and
thy
soul
liveth
will
not
leave
thee
they
went
down
Beth
Kings
And
the
sons
the
prophets
that
were
Beth
came
forth
Elisha
and
said
unto
him
Knowest
thou
that
Jehovah
will
take
away
thy
master
from
thy
head
day
And
said
Yea
know
hold
your
peace
Kings
And
Elijah
said
unto
him
Elisha
tarry
here
pray
thee
for
Jehovah
hath
sent

And
said
Jehovah
liveth
and
thy
soul
liveth
will
not
leave
thee
they
came

Kings
And
the
sons
the
prophets
that
were
Jericho
came
near
Elisha
and
said
unto
him
Knowest
thou
that
Jehovah
will
take
away
thy
master
from
thy
head
day
And
answered
Yea
know
hold
your
peace
Kings
And
Elijah
said
unto
him
Tarry
here
pray
thee
for
Jehovah
hath
sent
the
Jordan
And
said
Jehovah
liveth
and
thy
soul
liveth
will
not
leave
thee
And
they
two
went
Kings
And
fifty
men
the
sons
the
prophets
went
and
stood
over
against
them
afar
off
and
they
two
stood
the
Jordan
Kings
And
Elijah
took
his
mantle
and
wrapped
together
and
smote
the
waters
and
they
were
divided
hither
and
thither
that
they
two
went
over
dry
ground
Kings
And
came
pass
when
they
were
gone
over
that
Elijah
said
unto
Elisha
Ask
what
shall
for
thee
before
taken
from
thee
And
Elisha
said
pray
thee
let
double
portion
thy
spirit
upon
Kings
And
said
Thou
hast
asked
hard
thing
nevertheless
thou
see
when
taken
from
thee
shall
unto
thee
but
not
shall
not
Kings
And
came
pass
they
still
went
and
talked
that
behold
there
appeared
chariot
fire
and
horses
fire
which
parted
them
both
asunder
and
Elijah
went
whirlwind
into
heaven
Kings
And
Elisha
saw
and
cried
father
father
the
chariots
Israel
and
the
horsemen
thereof
And
saw
him
more
and
took
hold
his
own
clothes
and
rent
them
two
pieces
Kings
took
also
the
mantle
Elijah
that
fell
from
him
and
went
back
and
stood
the
bank
the
Jordan
Kings
And
took
the
mantle
Elijah
that
fell
from
him
and
smote
the
waters
and
said
Where
Jehovah
the
God
Elijah
and
when
also
had
smitten
the
waters
they
were
divided
hither
and
thither
and
Elisha
went
over
Kings
And
when
the
sons
the
prophets
that
were
Jericho
over
against
him
saw
him
they
said
The
spirit
Elijah
doth
rest
Elisha
And
they
came
meet
him
and
bowed
themselves
the
ground
before
him
Kings
And
they
said
unto
him
Behold
now
there
are
with
thy
servants
fifty
strong
men
let
them
pray
thee
and
seek
thy
master
lest
the
Spirit
Jehovah
hath
taken
him
and
cast
him
upon
some
mountain
into
some
valley
And
said
shall
not
send
Kings
And
when
they
urged
him
till
was
ashamed
said
Send
They
sent
therefore
fifty
men
and
they
sought
three
days
but
found
him
not
Kings
And
they
came
back
him
while
tarried
Jericho
and
said
unto
them
Did
not
say
unto
you
not
Kings
And
the
men
the
city
said
unto
Elisha
Behold
pray
thee
the
situation
this
city
pleasant
lord
seeth
but
the
water
bad
and
the
land
miscarrieth
Kings
And
said
Bring
new
cruse
and
put
salt
therein
And
they
brought
him
Kings
And
went
forth
unto
the
spring
the
waters
and
cast
salt
therein
and
said
Thus
saith
Jehovah
have
healed
these
waters
there
shall
not
from
thence
any
more
death
miscarrying
Kings
the
waters
were
healed
unto
this
day
according
the
word
Elisha
which
spake
Kings
And
went
from
thence
unto
Beth
and
was
going
the
way
there
came
forth
young
lads
out
the
city
and
mocked
him
and
said
unto
him
thou
baldhead
thou
baldhead
Kings
And
looked
behind
him
and
saw
them
and
cursed
them
the
name
Jehovah
And
there
came
forth
two
she
bears
out
the
wood
and
tare
forty
and
two
lads
them
Kings
And
went
from
thence
mount
Carmel
and
from
thence
returned
Samaria
Kings
Now
Jehoram
the
son
Ahab
began
reign
over
Israel
Samaria
the
eighteenth
year
Jehoshaphat
king
Judah
and
reigned
twelve
years
Kings
And
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
but
not
like
his
father
and
like
his
mother
for
put
away
the
pillar
Baal
that
his
father
had
made
Kings
Nevertheless
cleaved
unto
the
sins
Jeroboam
the
son
Nebat
wherewith
made
Israel
sin
departed
not
therefrom
Kings
Now
Mesha
king
Moab
was
sheep
master
and
rendered
unto
the
king
Israel
the
wool
hundred
thousand
lambs
and
hundred
thousand
rams
Kings
But
came
pass
when
Ahab
was
dead
that
the
king
Moab
rebelled
against
the
king
Israel
Kings
And
king
Jehoram
went
out
Samaria
that
time
and
mustered
all
Israel
Kings
And
went
and
sent
Jehoshaphat
the
king
Judah
saying
The
king
Moab
hath
rebelled
against
wilt
thou
with
against
Moab
battle
And
said
will
thou
art
people
thy
people
horses
thy
horses
Kings
And
said
Which
way
shall
And
answered
The
way
the
wilderness
Edom
Kings
the
king
Israel
went
and
the
king
Judah
and
the
king
Edom
and
they
made
circuit
seven
days
journey
and
there
was
water
for
the
host
nor
for
the
beasts
that
followed
them
Kings
And
the
king
Israel
said
Alas
for
Jehovah
hath
called
these
three
kings
together
deliver
them
into
the
hand
Moab
Kings
But
Jehoshaphat
said
there
not
here
prophet
Jehovah
that
may
inquire
Jehovah
him
And
one
the
king
Israel
servants
answered
and
said
Elisha
the
son
Shaphat
here
who
poured
water
the
hands
Elijah
Kings
And
Jehoshaphat
said
The
word
Jehovah
with
him
the
king
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
and
the
king
Edom
went
down
him
Kings
And
Elisha
said
unto
the
king
Israel
What
have
with
thee
get
thee
the
prophets
thy
father
and
the
prophets
thy
mother
And
the
king
Israel
said
unto
him
Nay
for
Jehovah
hath
called
these
three
kings
together
deliver
them
into
the
hand
Moab
Kings
And
Elisha
said
Jehovah
hosts
liveth
before
whom
stand
surely
were
not
that
regard
the
presence
Jehoshaphat
the
king
Judah
would
not
look
toward
thee
nor
see
thee
Kings
But
now
bring
minstrel
And
came
pass
when
the
minstrel
played
that
the
hand
Jehovah
came
upon
him
Kings
And
said
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Make
this
valley
full
trenches
Kings
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
shall
not
see
wind
neither
shall
see
rain
yet
that
valley
shall
filled
with
water
and
shall
drink
both
and
your
cattle
and
your
beasts
Kings
And
this
but
light
thing
the
sight
Jehovah
will
also
deliver
the
Moabites
into
your
hand
Kings
And
shall
smite
every
fortified
city
and
every
choice
city
and
shall
fell
every
good
tree
and
stop
all
fountains
water
and
mar
every
good
piece
land
with
stones
Kings
And
came
pass
the
morning
about
the
time
offering
the
oblation
that
behold
there
came
water
the
way
Edom
and
the
country
was
filled
with
water
Kings
Now
when
all
the
Moabites
heard
that
the
kings
were
come
fight
against
them
they
gathered
themselves
together
all
that
were
able
put
armor
and
upward
and
stood
the
border
Kings
And
they
rose
early
the
morning
and
the
sun
shone
upon
the
water
and
the
Moabites
saw
the
water
over
against
them
red
blood
Kings
and
they
said
This
blood
the
kings
are
surely
destroyed
and
they
have
smitten
each
man
his
fellow
now
therefore
Moab
the
spoil
Kings
And
when
they
came
the
camp
Israel
the
Israelites
rose
and
smote
the
Moabites
that
they
fled
before
them
and
they
went
forward
into
the
land
smiting
the
Moabites
Kings
And
they
beat
down
the
cities
and
every
good
piece
land
they
cast
every
man
his
stone
and
filled
and
they
stopped
all
the
fountains
water
and
felled
all
the
good
trees
until
Kir
hareseth
only
they
left
the
stones
thereof
howbeit
the
slingers
went
about
and
smote
Kings
And
when
the
king
Moab
saw
that
the
battle
was
too
sore
for
him
took
with
him
seven
hundred
men
that
drew
sword
break
through
unto
the
king
Edom
but
they
could
not
Kings
Then
took
his
eldest
son
that
should
have
reigned
his
stead
and
offered
him
for
burnt
offering
upon
the
wall
And
there
was
great
wrath
against
Israel
and
they
departed
from
him
and
returned
their
own
land
Kings
Now
there
cried
certain
woman
the
wives
the
sons
the
prophets
unto
Elisha
saying
Thy
servant
husband
dead
and
thou
knowest
that
thy
servant
did
fear
Jehovah
and
the
creditor
come
take
unto
him
two
children
bondmen
Kings
And
Elisha
said
unto
her
What
shall
for
thee
tell
what
hast
thou
the
house
And
she
said
Thy
handmaid
hath
not
anything
the
house
save
pot
oil
Kings
Then
said
borrow
thee
vessels
abroad
all
thy
neighbors
even
empty
vessels
borrow
not
few
Kings
And
thou
shalt
and
shut
the
door
upon
thee
and
upon
thy
sons
and
pour
out
into
all
those
vessels
and
thou
shalt
set
aside
that
which
full
Kings
she
went
from
him
and
shut
the
door
upon
her
and
upon
her
sons
they
brought
the
vessels
her
and
she
poured
out
Kings
And
came
pass
when
the
vessels
were
full
that
she
said
unto
her
son
Bring
yet
vessel
And
said
unto
her
There
not
vessel
more
And
the
oil
stayed
Kings
Then
she
came
and
told
the
man
God
And
said
sell
the
oil
and
pay
thy
debt
and
live
thou
and
thy
sons
the
rest
Kings
And
fell
day
that
Elisha
passed
Shunem
where
was
great
woman
and
she
constrained
him
eat
bread
And
was
that
oft
passed
turned
thither
eat
bread
Kings
And
she
said
unto
her
husband
Behold
now
perceive
that
this
holy
man
God
that
passeth
continually
Kings
Let
make
pray
thee
little
chamber
the
wall
and
let
set

And

and

and

And
said
Gehazi
his
servant
Call

And
when

she
stood
before

Kings
And
said
unto
him
Say

Behold

And

And

And
Gehazi
answered
Verily

And
said
Call

And
when
had
called
her
she
stood

Kings
And
said
this
season
when
the
time
cometh
round
thou
shalt
embrace

And
she
said
Nay
lord
thou
man
God

Kings
And
the
woman
conceived
and
bare
son
that
season
when
the
time
came
round
Elisha
had
said
unto
her
Kings
And
when
the
child
was
grown
fell

that

Kings
And
said
unto
his
father
head

And
said
his
servant
Carry

mother
Kings
And
when
had
taken
him
and
brought
him
his
mother
sat

knees
till
noon
and
then
died
Kings
And
she
went
and
laid
him

bed
the
man
God
and
shut
the
door
upon
him
and
went
out
Kings
And
she
called
unto
her
husband
and
said
Send
pray
thee
one
the
servants
and
one
the
asses
that

run
the

and

Kings
And
said
Wherefore
wilt

And
she
said

Kings
Then
she
saddled
ass
and
said
her
servant
Drive

forward
slacken
not
the
riding
except

Kings
she
went
and
came
unto
the
man
God
mount
Carmel
And
came
pass
when
the
man
God
saw
her
afar
off
that
said
Gehazi
his
servant
Behold
yonder
the
Shunammite
Kings
run
pray
thee
now
meet
her
and
say
unto
her
well
with
thee
well
with
thy
husband
well
with
the
child
And
she
answered
well
Kings
And
when
she
came
the
man
God
the
hill
she
caught
hold
his
feet
And
Gehazi
came
near
thrust
her
away
but
the
man
God
said
Let
her
alone
for
her
soul
vexed
within
her
and
Jehovah
hath
hid
from
and
hath
not
told
Kings
Then
she
said
Did
desire
son
lord
did
not
say
not
deceive
Kings
Then
said
Gehazi
Gird
thy
loins
and
take
staff
thy
hand
and
thy
way
thou
meet
any
man
salute
him
not
and
any
salute
thee
answer
him
not
again
and
lay
staff
upon
the
face
the
child
Kings
And
the
mother
the
child
said
Jehovah
liveth
and
thy
soul
liveth
will
not
leave
thee
And
arose
and
followed
her
Kings
And
Gehazi
passed
before
them
and
laid
the
staff
upon
the
face
the
child
but
there
was
neither
voice
nor
hearing
Wherefore
returned
meet
him
and
told
him
saying
The
child
not
awaked
Kings
And
when
Elisha
was
come
into
the
house
behold
the
child
was
dead
and
laid
upon
his
bed
Kings
went
therefore
and
shut
the
door
upon
them
twain
and
prayed
unto
Jehovah
Kings
And
went
and
lay
upon
the
child
and
put
his
mouth
upon
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
upon
his
eyes
and
his
hands
upon
his
hands
and
stretched
himself
upon
him
and
the
flesh
the
child
waxed
warm
Kings
Then
returned
and
walked
the
house
once
and
fro
and
went
and
stretched
himself
upon
him
and
the
child
sneezed
seven
times
and
the
child
opened
his
eyes
Kings
And
called
Gehazi
and
said
Call
this
Shunammite
called
her
And
when
she
was
come
unto
him
said
Take
thy
son
Kings
Then
she
went
and
fell
his
feet
and
bowed
herself
the
ground
and
she
took
her
son
and
went
out
Kings
And
Elisha
came
again
Gilgal
And
there
was
dearth
the
land
and
the
sons
the
prophets
were
sitting
before
him
and
said
unto
his
servant
Set
the
great
pot
and
boil
pottage
for
the
sons
the
prophets
Kings
And
one
went
out
into
the
field

and
found
wild
vine
and
gathered
thereof
wild
gourds
his
lap
full
and
came
and
shred
them
into
the
pot
pottage
for
they
knew
them
not
Kings
they
poured

for
the
men

And
came

they
were
eating
the
pottage
that
they
cried
out
and
said
man

pot
And
they
could
not
eat

Kings
But
said
Then
bring
meal
And
cast

the
pot
and
said
Pour
out
for
the
people
that
they
may
eat
And
there
was
harm

pot
Kings
And
there
came
man
from
Baal
shalishah
and
brought
the
man
God
bread
the
first
fruits
twenty
loaves
barley
and
fresh
ears
grain

sack
And
said
Give

the
people
that
they
may
eat
Kings
And
his
servant
said
What
should
set
this
before
hundred
men
But
said
Give
the
people
that
they
may
eat
for
thus
saith
Jehovah
They
shall
eat
and
shall
leave

Kings
set
before
them
and
they
did
eat
and
left
thereof
according
the
word
Jehovah
Kings
Now
Naaman

Jehovah
had
given

And

and
she
waited

And
she
said
unto
her
mistress
Would

Kings
And

and
thus
said
the
maiden
that

And
the
king

And

And

And

when

And

Israel
had
rent

saying
Wherefore

And

unto
him
saying
and
wash

Jordan
seven
times
and
thy

But
Naaman
was
wroth
and
went
away
and
said
Behold

surely
come
out
and
stand
and
call
the
name
Jehovah

and
wave

And
his
servants
came
near
and
spake
unto
him
and
said
father
the
prophet

bid
thee
some
great
thing
wouldest
thou
not
have
done
how
much
rather
then
when

Then

according

saying
the

God
and
his

And

and
said
Behold

But

And

And
said
unto
him

departed
from
him

Kings
But
Gehazi
the
servant
Elisha
the
man
God
said
Behold

hath
spared

Naaman
the
Syrian
not
receiving
his
hands
that
which

Jehovah
liveth
will
run
after

and
take
somewhat

Kings
Gehazi
followed
after
Naaman
And
when
Naaman
saw
one
running
after
him
alighted
from
the
chariot
meet
him
and
said
all
well
Kings
And
said
All
well
master
hath
sent
saying
Behold
even
now
there
are
come
from
the
hill
country
Ephraim
two
young
men
the
sons
the
prophets
give
them
pray
thee
talent
silver
and
two
changes
raiment
Kings
And
Naaman
said
pleased
take
two
talents
And
urged
him
and
bound
two
talents
silver
two
bags
with
two
changes
raiment
and
laid
them
upon
two
his
servants
and
they
bare
them
before
him
Kings
And
when
came
the
hill
took
them
from
their
hand
and
bestowed
them
the
house
and
let
the
men
and
they
departed
Kings
But
went
and
stood
before
his
master
And
Elisha
said
unto
him
Whence
comest
thou
Gehazi
And
said
Thy
servant
went
whither
Kings
And
said
unto
him
Went

when
the
man
turned

money
and

and
oliveyards
and
vineyards
and
sheep
and
oxen
and
men
servants
and
maid
servants
Kings
The
leprosy
therefore
Naaman
shall
cleave
unto
thee
and
unto
thy
seed
for
ever
And
went
out
from
his
presence
leper
white
snow
Kings
And
the
sons
the
prophets
said
unto
Elisha
Behold
now
the
place
where
dwell
before
thee
too
strait
for
Kings
Let
pray
thee
unto
the
Jordan
and
take
thence
every
man
beam
and
let
make
place
there
where
may
dwell
And
answered
Kings
And
one
said
pleased
pray
thee
with
thy
servants
And
answered
will
Kings
went
with
them
And
when
they
came
the
Jordan
they
cut
down
wood
Kings
But
one
was
felling
beam
the
axe
head
fell
into
the
water
and
cried
and
said
Alas
master
for
was
borrowed
Kings
And
the
man
God
said
Where
fell
And
showed
him
the
place
And
cut
down
stick
and
cast
thither
and
made
the
iron
swim
Kings
And
said
Take
thee
put
out
his
hand
and
took
Kings
Now
the
king
Syria
was
warring
against
Israel
and
took
counsel
with
his
servants
saying
such
and
such
place
shall
camp
Kings
And
the
man
God
sent
unto
the
king
Israel
saying
Beware
that
thou
pass
not
such
place
for
thither
the
Syrians
are
coming
down
Kings
And
the
king
Israel
sent
the
place
which
the
man
God
told
him
and
warned
him
and
saved
himself
there
not
once
nor
twice
Kings
And
the
heart
the
king
Syria
was
sore
troubled
for
this
thing
and
called
his
servants
and
said
unto
them
Will
not
show
which
for
the
king
Israel
Kings
And
one
his
servants
said
Nay
lord
king
but
Elisha
the
prophet
that
Israel
telleth
the
king
Israel
the
words
that
thou
speakest
thy
bedchamber
Kings
And
said
and
see
where
that
may
send
and
fetch
him
And
was
told
him
saying
Behold
Dothan
Kings
Therefore
sent
thither
horses
and
chariots
and
great
host
and
they
came
night
and
compassed
the
city
about
Kings
And
when
the
servant
the
man
God
was
risen
early
and
gone
forth
behold
host
with
horses
and
chariots
was
round
about
the
city
And
his
servant
said
unto
him
Alas
master
how
shall
Kings
And
answered
Fear
not
for
they
that
are
with
are
more
than
they
that
are
with
them
Kings
And
Elisha
prayed
and
said
Jehovah
pray
thee
open
his
eyes
that
may
see
And
Jehovah
opened
the
eyes
the
young
man
and
saw
and
behold
the
mountain
was
full
horses
and
chariots
fire
round
about
Elisha
Kings
And
when
they
came
down
him
Elisha
prayed
unto
Jehovah
and
said
Smite
this
people
pray
thee
with
blindness
And
smote
them
with
blindness
according
the
word
Elisha
Kings
And
Elisha
said
unto
them
This
not
the
way
neither
this
the
city
follow
and
will
bring
you
the
man
whom
seek
And
led
them
Samaria
Kings
And
came
pass
when
they
were
come
into
Samaria
that
Elisha
said
Jehovah
open
the
eyes
these
men
that
they
may
see
And
Jehovah
opened
their
eyes
and
they
saw
and
behold
they
were
the
midst
Samaria
Kings
And
the
king
Israel
said
unto
Elisha
when
saw
them
father
shall
smite
them
shall
smite
them
Kings
And
answered
Thou
shalt
not
smite
them
wouldest
thou
smite
those
whom
thou
hast
taken
captive
with
thy
sword
and
with
thy
bow
set
bread
and
water
before
them
that
they
may
eat
and
drink
and
their
master
Kings
And
prepared
great
provision
for
them
and
when
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
sent
them
away
and
they
went
their
master
And
the
bands
Syria
came
more
into
the
land
Israel
Kings
And
came
pass
after
this
that
Benhadad
king
Syria
gathered
all
his
host
and
went
and
besieged
Samaria
Kings
And
there
was
great
famine
Samaria
and
behold
they
besieged
until
ass
head
was
sold
for
fourscore
pieces
silver
and
the
fourth
part
kab
dove
dung
for
five
pieces
silver
Kings
And
the
king
Israel
was
passing
upon
the
wall
there
cried
woman
unto
him
saying
Help
lord
king
Kings
And
said
Jehovah
not
help
thee
whence
shall
help
thee
out
the
threshing
floor
out
the
winepress
Kings
And
the
king
said
unto
her
What
aileth
thee
And
she
answered
This
woman
said
unto
Give
thy
son
that
may
eat
him
day
and
will
eat
son
morrow
Kings
boiled
son
and
did
eat
him
and
said
unto
her
the
next
day
Give
thy
son
that
may
eat
him
and
she
hath
hid
her
son
Kings
And
came
pass
when
the
king
heard
the
words
the
woman
that
rent
his
clothes
now
was
passing
upon
the
wall
and
the
people
looked
and
behold
had
sackcloth
within
upon
his
flesh
Kings
Then
said
God
and
more
also
the
head
Elisha
the
son
Shaphat
shall
stand
him
this
day
Kings
But
Elisha
was
sitting
his
house
and
the
elders
were
sitting
with
him
and
the
king
sent
man
from
before
him
but
ere
the
messenger
came
him
said
the
elders
See
how
this
son
murderer
hath
sent
take
away
head
look
when
the
messenger
cometh
shut
the
door
and
hold
the
door
fast
against
him
not
the
sound
his
master
feet
behind
him
Kings
And
while
was
yet
talking
with
them
behold
the
messenger
came
down
unto
him
and
said
Behold
this
evil
Jehovah
why
should
wait
for
Jehovah
any
longer
Kings
And
Elisha
said
Hear
the
word
Jehovah
thus
saith
Jehovah
morrow
about
this
time
shall
measure
fine
flour
sold
for
shekel
and
two
measures
barley
for
shekel
the
gate
Samaria
Kings
Then
the
captain
whose
hand
the
king
leaned
answered
the
man
God
and
said
Behold
Jehovah
should
make
windows
heaven
might
this
thing
And
said
Behold
thou
shalt
see
with
thine
eyes
but
shalt
not
eat
thereof
Kings
Now
there
were
four
leprous
men
the
entrance
the
gate
and
they
said
one
another
Why
sit
here
until
die
Kings
say
will
enter
into
the
city
then
the
famine
the
city
and
shall
die
there
and
sit
still
here
die
also
Now
therefore
come
and
let
fall
unto
the
host
the
Syrians
they
save
alive
shall
live
and
they
kill
shall
but
die
Kings
And
they
rose
the
twilight
unto
the
camp
the
Syrians
and
when
they
were
come
the
outermost
part
the
camp
the
Syrians
behold
there
was
man
there
Kings
For
the
Lord
had
made
the
host
the
Syrians
hear

And

saying
Arise

Now

And

And
Gehazi
said
lord
king

And

And
Elisha
said
unto
him
say
unto
him
Thou

recover
howbeit
Jehovah
hath
showed
that

surely
die
Kings
And
settled
his
countenance
stedfastly
upon
him
until

ashamed
and
the
man
God
wept
Kings
And
Hazael
said
Why

And
answered
Because

evil
that
thou
wilt
unto
the
children
Israel
their
strongholds
wilt
thou
set
fire
and
their
young
men
wilt
thou
slay
with
the
sword
and
wilt
dash
pieces
their
little
ones
and
rip
their
women
with
child
Kings
And
Hazael
said
But

who
but
dog
that

great
thing
And
Elisha
answered

hath
showed
that
thou

Then

and
came

master
who
said

And

And

Kings
And

And
opened
the
door
and
fled
Kings
Then
Jehu
came
forth
the
servants

lord
and
one
said
unto
him
all
well
wherefore

And

And

And
said
Thus
and
thus

saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
have
anointed
thee
king
over

Kings
Then
they
hasted
and
took
every
man
his
garment
and
put
under
him
the
top

stairs
and
blew
the
trumpet
saying
Jehu
king
Kings
Jehu
the
son
Jehoshaphat
the
son
Nimshi
conspired
against

Now
Joram

Joram
was
returned
healed

the
wounds
which
the
Syrians
had
given
him
when

And
Jehu
said
this
your
mind
then
let
none
escape
and
forth
out
the
city
tell
Jezreel
Kings
Jehu
rode
chariot
and
went

for
Joram
lay
there
And
Ahaziah
king
Judah
was
come
down
see
Joram
Kings
Now
the
watchman
was
standing
the
tower
Jezreel
and
spied
the
company
Jehu
came
and
said
see
company
And
Joram
said
Take
horseman
and
send
meet
them
and
let
him
say
peace
Kings
there
went
one
horseback
meet
him
and
said
Thus
saith
the
king
peace
And
Jehu
said
What
hast
thou
with
peace
turn
thee
behind
And
the
watchman
told
saying
The
messenger
came
them
but
cometh
not
back
Kings
Then
sent
out
second
horseback
who
came
them
and
said
Thus
saith
the
king
peace
And
Jehu
answered
What
hast
thou
with
peace
turn
thee
behind
Kings
And
the
watchman
told
saying
came
even
unto
them
and
cometh
not
back
and
the
driving
like
the
driving
Jehu
the
son
Nimshi
for
driveth
furiously
Kings
And
Joram
said
Make
ready
And
they
made
ready
his
chariot
And
Joram
king
Israel
and
Ahaziah
king
Judah
went
out
each
his
chariot
and
they
went
out
meet
Jehu
and
found
him
the
portion
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
Kings
And
came
pass
when
Joram
saw
Jehu
that
said
peace
Jehu
And
answered
What
peace
long
the
whoredoms
thy
mother
Jezebel
and
her
witchcrafts
are
many
Kings
And
Joram
turned
his
hands
and
fled
and
said
Ahaziah
There
treachery
Ahaziah
Kings
And
Jehu
drew
his
bow
with
his
full
strength
and
smote
Joram
between
his
arms
and
the
arrow
went
out
his
heart
and
sunk
down
his
chariot
Kings
Then
said
Jehu
Bidkar
his
captain
Take
and
cast
him
the
portion
the
field
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
for
remember
how
that
when
and
thou
rode
together
after
Ahab
his
father
Jehovah
laid
this
burden
upon
him
Kings
Surely
have
seen
yesterday
the
blood
Naboth
and
the
blood
his
sons
saith
Jehovah
and
will
requite
thee
this
plat
saith
Jehovah
Now
therefore
take
and
cast
him
into
the
plat
ground
according
the
word
Jehovah
Kings
But
when
Ahaziah
the
king
Judah
saw
this
fled
the
way
the
garden
house
And
Jehu
followed
after
him
and
said
Smite
him
also
the
chariot
and
they
smote
him
the
ascent
Gur
which
Ibleam
And
fled
Megiddo
and
died
there
Kings
And
his
servants
carried
him
chariot
Jerusalem
and
buried
him
his
sepulchre
with
his
fathers
the
city
David
Kings
And
the
eleventh
year
Joram
the
son
Ahab
began
Ahaziah
reign
over
Judah
Kings
And
when
Jehu
was
come
Jezreel
Jezebel
heard
and
she
painted
her
eyes
and
attired
her
head
and
looked
out
the
window
Kings
And
Jehu
entered
the
gate
she
said
peace
thou
Zimri
thy
master
murderer
Kings
And
lifted
his
face
the
window
and
said
Who
side
who
And
there
looked
out
him
two
three
eunuchs
Kings
And
said
Throw
her
down
they
threw
her
down
and
some
her
blood
was
sprinkled
the
wall
and
the
horses
and
trod
her
under
foot
Kings
And
when
was
come
did
eat
and
drink
and
said
See
now
this
cursed
woman
and
bury
her
for
she
king
daughter
Kings
And
they
went
bury
her
but
they
found
more
her
than
the
skull
and
the
feet
and
the
palms
her
hands
Kings
Wherefore
they
came
back
and
told
him
And
said
This
the
word
Jehovah
which
spake
his
servant
Elijah
the
Tishbite
saying
the
portion
Jezreel
shall
the
dogs
eat
the
flesh
Jezebel
Kings
and
the
body
Jezebel
shall
dung
upon
the
face
the
field
the
portion
Jezreel
that
they
shall
not
say
This
Jezebel
Kings
Now
Ahab
had
seventy
sons
Samaria
And
Jehu
wrote
letters
and
sent
Samaria
unto
the
rulers
Jezreel
even
the
elders
and
unto
them
that
brought
the
sons
Ahab
saying
Kings
And
now
soon
this
letter
cometh
you
seeing
your
master
sons
are
with
you
and
there
are
with
you
chariots
and
horses
fortified
city
also
and

Kings
look
out
the
best
and
meetest
your
master
sons
and
set
him
his
father
throne
and
fight
for
your
master
house
Kings
But
they
were
exceedingly
afraid
and
said
Behold
the
two
kings
stood
not
before
him
how
then
shall
stand
Kings
And
that
was
over
the
household
and
that
was
over
the
city
the
elders
also
and
they
that
brought
the
children
sent
Jehu
saying
are
thy
servants
and
will
all
that
thou
shalt
bid
will
not
make
any
man
king
thou
that
which
good

eyes
Kings
Then
wrote
letter
the
second
time
them
saying
side
and
will
hearken
unto
voice
take
the
heads
the
men
your
master
sons
and
come
Jezreel
morrow
this
time
Now
the
king
sons
being
seventy
persons
were
with
the
great
men
the
city
who
brought
them
Kings
And
came
pass
when
the
letter
came
them
that
they
took
the
king
sons
and
slew
them
even
seventy
persons
and
put
their
heads
baskets
and
sent
them
unto
him
Jezreel
Kings
And
there
came
messenger
and
told
him
saying
They
have
brought
the
heads
the
king
sons
And
said
Lay
them
two
heaps
the
entrance
the
gate
until
the
morning
Kings
And
came
pass
the
morning
that
went
out
and
stood
and
said
all
the
people
are
righteous
behold
conspired
against
master
and
slew
him
but
who
smote
all
these
Kings
Know
now
that
there
shall
fall
unto
the
earth
nothing
the
word
Jehovah
which
Jehovah
spake
concerning
the
house
Ahab
for
Jehovah
hath
done
that
which
spake
his
servant
Elijah
Kings
Jehu
smote
all
that
remained
the
house
Ahab
Jezreel
and
all
his
great
men
and
his
familiar
friends
and
his
priests
until
left
him
none
remaining
Kings
And
arose
and
departed
and
went
Samaria
And
was
the
shearing
house
the
shepherds
the
way
Kings
Jehu
met
with
the
brethren
Ahaziah
king
Judah
and
said
Who
are
And
they
answered
are
the
brethren
Ahaziah
and
down
salute
the
children
the
king
and
the
children
the
queen
Kings
And
said
Take
them
alive
And
they
took
them
alive
and
slew
them
the
pit
the
shearing
house
even
two
and
forty
men
neither
left
any
them
Kings
And
when
was
departed
thence
lighted
Jehonadab
the
son
Rechab
coming
meet
him
and
saluted
him
and
said
him
thy
heart
right
heart
with
thy
heart
And
Jehonadab
answered
give
thy
hand
And
gave
him
his
hand
and
took
him
him
into
the
chariot
Kings
And
said
Come
with
and
see
zeal
for
Jehovah
they
made
him
ride
his
chariot
Kings
And
when
came
Samaria
smote
all
that
remained
unto
Ahab
Samaria
till
had
destroyed
him
according
the
word
Jehovah
which
spake
Elijah
Kings
And
Jehu
gathered
all
the
people
together
and
said
unto
them
Ahab
served
Baal
little
but
Jehu
will
serve
him
much
Kings
Now
therefore
call
unto
all
the
prophets
Baal
all
his
worshippers
and
all
his
priests
let
none
wanting
for
have
great
sacrifice
Baal
whosoever
shall
wanting
shall
not
live
But
Jehu
did
subtlety
the
intent
that
might
destroy
the
worshippers
Baal
Kings
And
Jehu
said
Sanctify
solemn
assembly
for
Baal
And
they
proclaimed
Kings
And
Jehu
sent
through
all
Israel
and
all
the
worshippers
Baal
came
that
there
was
not
man
left
that
came
not
And
they
came
into
the
house
Baal
and
the
house
Baal
was
filled
from
one
end
another
Kings
And
said
unto
him
that
was
over
the
vestry
Bring
forth
vestments
for
all
the
worshippers
Baal
And
brought
them
forth
vestments
Kings
And
Jehu
went
and
Jehonadab
the
son
Rechab
into
the
house
Baal
and
said
unto
the
worshippers
Baal
Search
and
look
that
there
here
with
you
none
the
servants
Jehovah
but
the
worshippers
Baal
only
Kings
And
they
went
offer
sacrifices
and
burnt
offerings
Now
Jehu
had
appointed
him
fourscore
men
without
and
said
any
the
men
whom
bring
into
your
hands
escape
that
letteth
him
his
life
shall
for
the
life
him
Kings
And
came
pass
soon
had
made
end
offering
the
burnt
offering
that
Jehu
said
the
guard
and
the
captains
and
slay
them
let
none
come
forth
And
they
smote
them
with
the
edge
the
sword
and
the
guard
and
the
captains
cast
them
out
and
went
the
city
the
house
Baal
Kings
And
they
brought
forth
the
pillars
that
were
the
house
Baal
and
burned
them
Kings
And
they
brake
down
the
pillar
Baal
and
brake
down
the
house
Baal
and
made
draught
house
unto
this
day
Kings
Thus
Jehu
destroyed
Baal
out
Israel
Kings
Howbeit
from
the
sins
Jeroboam
the
son
Nebat
wherewith
made
Israel
sin
Jehu
departed
not
from
after
them
wit
the
golden
calves
that
were
Beth
and
that
were
Dan
Kings
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Jehu
Because
thou
hast
done
well
executing
that
which
right
mine
eyes
and
hast
done
unto
the
house
Ahab
according
all
that
was
heart
thy
sons
the
fourth
generation
shall
sit
the
throne
Israel
Kings
But
Jehu
took
heed
walk
the
law
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
with
all
his
heart
departed
not
from
the
sins
Jeroboam
wherewith
made
Israel
sin
Kings
those
days
Jehovah
began
cut
off
from
Israel
and
Hazael
smote
them
all
the
borders
Israel
Kings
from
the
Jordan
eastward
all
the
land
Gilead
the
Gadites
and
the
Reubenites
and
the
Manassites
from
Aroer
which
the
valley
the
Arnon
even
Gilead
and
Bashan
Kings
Now
the
rest
the
acts
Jehu
and
all
that
did
and
all
his
might
are
they
not
written
the
book
the
chronicles
the
kings
Israel
Kings
And
Jehu
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
Samaria
And
Jehoahaz
his
son
reigned
his
stead
Kings
And
the
time
that
Jehu
reigned
over
Israel
Samaria
was
twenty
and
eight
years
Kings
Now
when
Athaliah
the
mother
Ahaziah
saw
that
her
son
was
dead
she
arose
and
destroyed
all
the
seed
royal
Kings
But
Jehosheba
the
daughter
king
Joram
sister
Ahaziah
took
Joash
the
son
Ahaziah
and
stole
him
away
from
among
the
king
sons
that
were
slain
even
him
and
his
nurse
and
put
them
the
bedchamber
and
they
hid
him
from
Athaliah
that
was
not
slain
Kings
And
was
with
her
hid
the
house
Jehovah
six
years
And
Athaliah
reigned
over
the
land
Kings
And
the
seventh
year
Jehoiada
sent
and
fetched
the
captains
over
hundreds
the
Carites
and
the
guard
and
brought
them
him
into
the
house
Jehovah
and
made
covenant
with
them
and
took
oath
them
the
house
Jehovah
and
showed
them
the
king
son
Kings
And
commanded
them
saying
This
the
thing
that
shall
third
part
you
that
come
the
sabbath
shall
keepers
the
watch
the
king
house
Kings
and
third
part
shall

gate
Sur
and
third
part
the
gate
behind
the
guard
shall
keep
the
watch
the
house
and
barrier
Kings
And
the
two
companies
you
even
all
that
forth
the
sabbath
shall
keep
the
watch
the
house
Jehovah
about
the
king
Kings
And
shall
compass
the
king
round
about
every
man
with
his
weapons
his
hand
and
that
cometh
within
the
ranks
let
him
slain
and
with
the
king
when
goeth
out
and
when
cometh
Kings
And
the
captains
over
hundreds
did
according
all
that
Jehoiada
the
priest
commanded
and
they
took
every
man
his
men
those
that
were
come
the
sabbath
with
those
that
were
out
the
sabbath
and
came
Jehoiada
the
priest
Kings
And
the
priest
delivered
the
captains
over
hundreds
the
spears
and
shields
that
had
been
king
David
which
were
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
And
the
guard
stood
every
man
with
his
weapons
his
hand
from
the
right
side
the
house
the
left
side
the
house
along
the
altar
and
the
house
the
king
round
about
Kings
Then
brought
out
the
king
son
and
put
the
crown
upon
him
and
gave
him
the
testimony
and
they
made
him
king
and
anointed
him
and
they
clapped
their
hands
and
said
Long
live
the
king
Kings
And
when
Athaliah
heard
the
noise
the
guard
and
the
people
she
came
the
people
into
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
and
she
looked
and
behold
the
king
stood
the
pillar
the
manner
was
and
the
captains
and
the
trumpets
the
king
and
all
the
people
the
land
rejoiced
and
blew
trumpets
Then
Athaliah
rent
her
clothes
and
cried
Treason
treason
Kings
And
Jehoiada
the
priest
commanded
the
captains
hundreds
that
were
set
over
the
host
and
said
unto
them
Have
her
forth
between
the
ranks
and
him
that
followeth
her
slay
with
the
sword
For
the
priest
said
Let
her
not
slain
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
they
made
way
for
her
and
she
went
the
way
the
horses
entry
the
king
house
and
there
was
she
slain
Kings
And
Jehoiada
made
covenant
between
Jehovah
and
the
king
and
the
people
that
they
should
Jehovah
people
between
the
king
also
and
the
people
Kings
And
all
the
people
the
land
went
the
house
Baal
and
brake
down
his
altars
and
his
images
brake
they
pieces
thoroughly
and
slew
Mattan
the
priest
Baal
before
the
altars
And
the
priest
appointed
officers
over
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
And
took
the
captains
over
hundreds
and
the
Carites
and
the
guard
and
all
the
people
the
land
and
they
brought
down
the
king
from
the
house
Jehovah
and
came
the
way
the
gate
the
guard
unto
the
king
house
And
sat
the
throne
the
kings
Kings
all
the
people
the
land
rejoiced
and
the
city
was
quiet
And
Athaliah
they
had
slain
with
the
sword
the
king
house
Kings
Jehoash
was
seven
years
old
when
began
reign
Kings
the
seventh
year
Jehu
began
Jehoash
reign
and
reigned
forty
years
Jerusalem
and
his
mother
name
was
Zibiah
Beer
sheba
Kings
And
Jehoash
did
that
which
was
right
the
eyes
Jehovah
all
his
days
wherein
Jehoiada
the
priest
instructed
him
Kings
Howbeit
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
the
people
still
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense
the
high
places
Kings
And
Jehoash
said
the
priests
All
the
money
the
hallowed
things
that
brought
into
the
house
Jehovah
current
money
the
money
the
persons
for
whom
each
man
rated
and
all
the
money
that
cometh
into
any
man
heart
bring
into
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
let
the
priests
take
them
every
man
from
his
acquaintance
and
they
shall
repair
the
breaches
the
house
wheresoever
any
breach
shall
found
Kings
But
was
that
the
three
and
twentieth
year
king
Jehoash
the
priests
had
not
repaired
the
breaches
the
house
Kings
Then
king
Jehoash
called
for
Jehoiada
the
priest
and
for
the
other
priests
and
said
unto
them
Why
repair
not
the
breaches
the
house
now
therefore
take
more
money
from
your
acquaintance
but
deliver
for
the
breaches
the
house
Kings
And
the
priests
consented
that
they
should
take
more
money
from
the
people
neither
repair
the
breaches
the
house
Kings
But
Jehoiada
the
priest
took
chest
and
bored
hole
the
lid
and
set
beside
the
altar
the
right
side
one
cometh
into
the
house
Jehovah
and
the
priests
that
kept
the
threshold
put
therein
all
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
And
was
when
they
saw
that
there
was
much
money
the
chest
that
the
king
scribe
and
the
high
priest
came
and
they
put
bags
and
counted
the
money
that
was
found

house
Jehovah
Kings
And
they
gave
the
money
that
was
weighed
out
into
the
hands
them
that
did
the
work
that
had
the
oversight
the
house
Jehovah
and
they
paid
out
the
carpenters
and
the

and

into
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
for
they
gave
that
them
that
did
the
work
and
repaired
therewith
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
Moreover
they
reckoned
not
with
the
men
into
whose
hand
they
delivered
the
money
give
them
that
did
the
work
for
they
dealt
faithfully
Kings
The
money
for
the
trespass
offerings
and
the
money
for
the
sin
offerings
was
not
brought
into
the
house
Jehovah
was

Kings
Then
Hazael
king
Syria
went
and
fought
against
Gath
and
took
and
Hazael
set
his
face
Jerusalem
Kings
And
Jehoash
king
Judah
took
all
the
hallowed
things
that
Jehoshaphat
and
Jehoram
and
Ahaziah
his
fathers
kings
Judah
had
dedicated
and
his
own

and
all
the
gold
that

and
the
king

and
sent
Hazael
king
Syria
and
went
away
from

Now

rest
the

Joash
and
all
that
did
are
they
not

And
his

arose
and
made

and
smote

For
Jozacar
the

Jehoahaz
the

Jehu
began
reign
over

And

evil

sight
Jehovah
and
followed
the
sins
Jeroboam
the
son
Nebat
wherewith
made
Israel
sin
departed
not
therefrom
Kings
And
the
anger
Jehovah
was
kindled
against
Israel
and
delivered
them
into
the
hand
Hazael
king
Syria
and
into
the
hand
Benhadad
the
son
Hazael
continually
Kings
And
Jehoahaz
besought
Jehovah
and
Jehovah
hearkened
unto
him
for
saw
the
oppression
Israel
how
that
the
king
Syria
oppressed
them
Kings
And
Jehovah
gave
Israel
saviour
that
they
went
out
from
under
the
hand
the
Syrians
and
the
children
Israel
dwelt
their
tents
beforetime
Kings
Nevertheless
they
departed
not
from
the
sins
the
house
Jeroboam
wherewith
made
Israel
sin
but
walked
therein
and
there
remained
the
Asherah

For
left
not
Jehoahaz

and
ten
chariots
and
ten
thousand
footmen
for
the

Syria
destroyed
them
and
made
them
like

Kings
Now
the
rest
the

Jehoahaz
and
all
that
did
and
his

are
they
not

the

Joash

And
did
that
which

Jehovah
departed
not
from
all
the

Jeroboam
the

Nebat
wherewith
made

Now
the
rest
the

Joash
and
all

his

wherewith
fought
against
Amaziah

slept
with
his

and
Jeroboam
sat
upon
his
throne
and
Joash
was
buried
Samaria
with
the
kings
Israel
Kings
Now
Elisha
was
fallen
sick
his
sickness
whereof
died
and
Joash
the
king
Israel
came
down
unto
him
and
wept
over
him
and
said
father
father
the
chariots
Israel
and
the
horsemen
thereof
Kings
And
Elisha
said
unto
him
Take
bow
and
arrows
and
took
unto
him
bow
and
arrows
Kings
And
said
the
king
Israel
Put
thy

Elisha
laid
his
hands
upon
the

Kings
And
said
Open
the
window
eastward
and
opened
Then
Elisha
said
Shoot

shot
And
said
Jehovah

over
Syria
for
thou

And
said
Take
the
arrows
and
took
them
And
said
unto
the
king
Israel
Smite
upon
the
ground
and
smote
thrice
and
stayed
Kings
And
the
man
God
was
wroth
with
him
and
said
Thou
shouldest
have
smitten
five
six
times
then
hadst
thou
smitten
Syria
till
thou
hadst
consumed
whereas
now
thou
shalt
smite
Syria
but
thrice
Kings
And
Elisha
died
and
they
buried
him
Now
the
bands
the
Moabites
invaded
the
land
the
coming
the
year
Kings
And
came
pass
they
were
burying
man
that
behold
they
spied

and
they
cast
the
man
into
the
sepulchre
Elisha
and
soon
the
man
touched
the
bones
Elisha
revived
and
stood
his
feet
Kings
And
Hazael
king
Syria
oppressed
Israel
all
the
days
Jehoahaz
Kings
But
Jehovah
was
gracious
unto
them
and
had
compassion
them
and
had
respect
unto
them
because
his
covenant

Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob

would
not
destroy
them
neither
cast
them

And
Hazael
king
Syria
died
and
Benhadad
his

Kings
And
Jehoash
the

Jehoahaz
took

And
did

Howbeit

And
came

soon
the

Kings
Thou

Now
the
rest
the
acts
Ahaz
which

And
Ahaz

and
Hezekiah
his

reigned
his

Kings
the
twelfth
year
Ahaz
king
Judah
began
Hoshea
the
son
Elah
reign
Samaria
over
Israel
and
reigned
nine
years
Kings
And
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
yet
not
the
kings
Israel
that
were
before
him
Kings
Against
him
came
Shalmaneser
king
Assyria
and
Hoshea
became
his
servant
and
brought
him
tribute
Kings
And
the
king
Assyria
found
conspiracy
Hoshea
for
had
sent
messengers
king
Egypt
and
offered
tribute
the
king
Assyria
had
done
year
year
therefore
the
king
Assyria
shut
him
and
bound
him
prison
Kings
Then
the
king
Assyria
came
throughout
all
the
land
and
went
Samaria
and
besieged
three
years
Kings
the
ninth
year
Hoshea
the
king
Assyria
took
Samaria
and
carried
Israel
away
unto
Assyria
and
placed
them
Halah
and
the
Habor
the
river
Gozan
and
the
cities
the
Medes
Kings
And
was
because
the
children
Israel
had
sinned
against
Jehovah
their
God
who
brought
them
out
the
land
Egypt
from
under
the
hand
Pharaoh
king
Egypt
and
had
feared
other
gods
Kings
and
walked
the
statutes
the
nations
whom
Jehovah
cast
out
from
before
the
children
Israel
and
the
kings
Israel
which
they
made
Kings
And
the
children
Israel
did
secretly
things
that
were
not
right
against
Jehovah
their
God
and
they
built
them
high
places
all
their
cities
from
the
tower
the
watchmen
the
fortified
city
Kings
and
they
set
them
pillars
and
Asherim
upon
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
Kings
and
there
they
burnt
incense
all
the
high
places
did
the
nations
whom
Jehovah
carried
away
before
them
and
they
wrought
wicked
things
provoke
Jehovah
anger
Kings
and
they
served
idols
whereof
Jehovah
had
said
unto
them
shall
not
this
thing
Kings
Yet
Jehovah
testified
unto
Israel
and
unto
Judah
every
prophet
and
every
seer
saying
Turn
from
your
evil
ways
and
keep
commandments
and
statutes
according
all
the
law
which
commanded
your
fathers
and
which
sent
you
servants
the
prophets
Kings
Notwithstanding
they
would
not
hear
but
hardened
their
neck
like
the
neck
their
fathers
who
believed
not
Jehovah
their
God
Kings
And
they
rejected
his
statutes
and
his
covenant
that
made
with
their
fathers
and
his
testimonies
which
testified
unto
them
and
they
followed
vanity
and
became
vain
and
went
after
the
nations
that
were
round
about
them
concerning
whom
Jehovah
had
charged
them
that
they
should
not
like
them
Kings
And
they
forsook
all
the
commandments
Jehovah
their
God
and
made
them
molten
images
even
two
calves
and
made
Asherah
and
worshipped
all
the
host
heaven
and
served
Baal
Kings
And
they
caused
their
sons
and
their
daughters
pass
through
the
fire
and
used
divination
and
enchantments
and
sold
themselves
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
provoke
him
anger
Kings
Therefore
Jehovah
was
very
angry
with
Israel
and
removed
them
out
his
sight
there
was
none
left
but
the
tribe
Judah
only
Kings
Also
Judah
kept
not
the
commandments
Jehovah
their
God
but
walked
the
statutes
Israel
which
they
made
Kings
And
Jehovah
rejected
all
the
seed
Israel
and
afflicted
them
and
delivered
them
into
the
hand
spoilers
until
had
cast
them
out
his
sight
Kings
For
rent
Israel
from
the
house
David
and
they
made
Jeroboam
the
son
Nebat
king
and
Jeroboam
drove
Israel
from
following
Jehovah
and
made
them
sin
great
sin
Kings
And
the
children
Israel
walked
all
the
sins
Jeroboam
which
did
they
departed
not
from
them
Kings
until
Jehovah
removed
Israel
out
his
sight
spake
all
his
servants
the
prophets
Israel
was
carried
away
out
their
own
land
Assyria
unto
this
day
Kings
And
the
king
Assyria
brought
men
from
Babylon
and
from
Cuthah
and
from
Avva
and
from
Hamath
and
Sepharvaim
and
placed
them
the
cities
Samaria
instead
the
children
Israel
and
they
possessed
Samaria
and
dwelt
the
cities
thereof
Kings
And
was
the
beginning
their
dwelling
there
that
they
feared
not
Jehovah
therefore
Jehovah
sent
lions
among
them
which
killed
some
them
Kings
Wherefore
they
spake
the
king
Assyria
saying
The
nations
which
thou
hast
carried
away
and
placed
the
cities
Samaria
know
not
the
law
the
god
the
land
therefore
hath
sent
lions
among
them
and
behold
they
slay
them
because
they
know
not
the
law
the
god
the
land
Kings
Then
the
king
Assyria
commanded
saying
Carry
thither
one
the
priests
whom
brought
from
thence
and
let
them
and
dwell
there
and
let
him
teach
them
the
law
the
god
the
land
Kings
one
the
priests
whom
they
had
carried
away
from
Samaria
came
and
dwelt
Beth
and
taught
them
how
they
should
fear
Jehovah
Kings
Howbeit
every
nation
made
gods
their
own
and
put
them
the
houses
the
high
places
which
the
Samaritans
had
made
every
nation
their
cities
wherein
they
dwelt
Kings
And
the
men
Babylon
made
Succoth
benoth
and
the
men
Cuth
made
Nergal
and
the
men
Hamath
made
Ashima
Kings
and
the
Avvites
made
Nibhaz
and
Tartak
and
the
Sepharvites
burnt
their
children
the
fire
Adrammelech
and
Anammelech
the
gods
Sepharvaim
Kings
they
feared
Jehovah
and
made
unto
them
from
among
themselves
priests
the
high
places
who
sacrificed
for
them
the
houses
the
high
places
Kings
They
feared
Jehovah
and
served
their
own
gods
after
the
manner
the
nations
from
among
whom
they
had
been
carried
away
Kings
Unto
this
day
they
after
the
former
manner
they
fear
not
Jehovah
neither
they
after
their
statutes
after
their
ordinances
after
the
law
after
the
commandment
which
Jehovah
commanded
the
children
Jacob
whom
named
Israel
Kings
with
whom
Jehovah
had
made
covenant
and
charged
them
saying
shall
not
fear
other
gods
nor
bow
yourselves
them
nor
serve
them
nor
sacrifice
them
Kings
but
Jehovah
who
brought
you
out
the
land
Egypt
with
great
power
and
with
outstretched
arm
him
shall
fear
and
unto
him
shall
bow
yourselves
and
him
shall
sacrifice
Kings
and
the
statutes
and
the
ordinances
and
the
law
and
the
commandment
which
wrote
for
you
shall
observe
for
evermore
and
shall
not
fear
other
gods
Kings
and
the
covenant
that
have
made
with
you
shall
not
forget
neither
shall
fear
other
gods
Kings
but
Jehovah
your
God
shall
fear
and
will
deliver
you
out
the
hand
all
your
enemies
Kings
Howbeit
they
did
not
hearken
but
they
did
after
their
former
manner
Kings
these
nations
feared
Jehovah
and
served
their
graven
images
their
children
likewise
and
their
children
children
did
their
fathers
they
unto
this
day
Kings
Now
came
pass
the
third
year
Hoshea
son
Elah
king
Israel
that
Hezekiah
the
son
Ahaz
king
Judah
began
reign
Kings
Twenty
and
five
years
old
was
when
began
reign
and
reigned
twenty
and
nine
years
Jerusalem
and
his
mother
name
was
Abi
the
daughter
Zechariah
Kings
And
did
that
which
was
right
the
eyes
Jehovah
according
all
that
David
his
father
had
done
Kings
removed
the
high
places
and
brake
the
pillars
and
cut
down
the
Asherah
and
brake
pieces
the
brazen
serpent
that
Moses
had
made
for
unto
those
days
the
children
Israel
did
burn
incense
and
called
Nehushtan
Kings
trusted
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
that
after
him
was
none
like
him
among
all
the
kings
Judah
nor
among
them
that
were
before
him
Kings
For
clave
Jehovah
departed
not
from
following
him
but
kept
his
commandments
which
Jehovah
commanded
Moses
Kings
And
Jehovah
was
with
him
whithersoever
went
forth
prospered
and
rebelled
against
the
king
Assyria
and
served
him
not
Kings
smote
the
Philistines
unto
Gaza
and
the
borders
thereof
from
the
tower
the
watchmen
the
fortified
city
Kings
And
came
pass
the
fourth
year
king
Hezekiah
which
was
the
seventh
year
Hoshea
son
Elah
king
Israel
that
Shalmaneser
king
Assyria
came
against
Samaria
and
besieged
Kings
And
the
end
three
years
they
took
the
sixth
year
Hezekiah
which
was
the
ninth
year
Hoshea
king
Israel
Samaria
was
taken
Kings
And
the
king
Assyria
carried
Israel
away
unto
Assyria
and
put
them
Halah
and
the
Habor
the
river
Gozan
and
the
cities
the
Medes
Kings
because
they
obeyed
not
the
voice
Jehovah
their
God
but
transgressed
his
covenant
even
all
that
Moses
the
servant
Jehovah
commanded
and
would
not
hear
nor
Kings
Now
the
fourteenth
year
king
Hezekiah
did
Sennacherib
king
Assyria
come
against
all
the
fortified
cities
Judah
and
took
them
Kings
And
Hezekiah
king
Judah
sent
the
king
Assyria
Lachish
saying
have
offended
return
from
that
which
thou
puttest
will
bear
And
the
king
Assyria
appointed
unto
Hezekiah
king
Judah
three
hundred
talents
silver
and
thirty
talents
gold
Kings
And
Hezekiah
gave
him
all
the
silver
that
was
found
the
house
Jehovah
and
the
treasures
the
king
house
Kings
that
time
did
Hezekiah
cut
off
the
gold
from
the
doors
the
temple
Jehovah
and
from
the
pillars
which
Hezekiah
king
Judah
had
overlaid
and
gave
the
king
Assyria
Kings
And
the
king
Assyria
sent
Tartan
and
Rab
saris
and
Rabshakeh
from
Lachish
king
Hezekiah
with
great
army
unto
Jerusalem
And
they
went
and
came
Jerusalem
And
when
they
were
come
they
came
and
stood
the
conduit
the
upper
pool
which
the
highway
the
fuller
field
Kings
And
when
they
had
called
the
king
there
came
out
them
Eliakim
the
son
Hilkiah
who
was
over
the
household
and
Shebnah
the
scribe
and
Joah
the
son
Asaph
the
recorder
Kings
And
Rabshakeh
said
unto
them
Say
now
Hezekiah
Thus
saith
the
great
king
the
king
Assyria
What
confidence
this
wherein
thou
trustest
Kings
Thou
sayest
but
they
are
but
vain
words
There
counsel
and
strength
for
the
war
Now
whom
dost
thou
trust
that
thou
hast
rebelled
against
Kings
Now
behold
thou
trustest
upon
the
staff
this
bruised
reed
even
upon
Egypt
whereon
man
lean
will
into
his
hand
and
pierce
Pharaoh
king
Egypt
unto
all
that
trust
him
Kings
But
say
unto
trust
Jehovah
our
God
not
that
whose
high
places
and
whose
altars
Hezekiah
hath
taken
away
and
hath
said
Judah
and
Jerusalem
shall
worship
before
this
altar
Jerusalem
Kings
Now
therefore
pray
thee
give
pledges
master
the
king
Assyria
and
will
give
thee
two
thousand
horses
thou
able
thy
part
set
riders
upon
them
Kings
How
then
canst
thou
turn
away
the
face
one
captain
the
least
master
servants
and
put
thy
trust
Egypt
for
chariots
and
for
horsemen
Kings
now
come
without
Jehovah
against
this
place
destroy
Jehovah
said
unto
against
this
land
and
destroy
Kings
Then
said
Eliakim
the
son
Hilkiah
and
Shebnah
and
Joah
unto
Rabshakeh
Speak
pray
thee
thy
servants
the
Syrian
language
for
understand
and
speak
not
with
the
Jews
language
the
ears
the
people
that
are
the
wall
Kings
But
Rabshakeh
said
unto
them
Hath
master
sent
thy
master
and
thee
speak
these
words
hath
not
sent
the
men
that
sit
the
wall
eat
their
own
dung
and
drink
their
own
water
with
you
Kings
Then
Rabshakeh
stood
and
cried
with
loud
voice
the
Jews
language
and
spake
saying
Hear
the
word
the
great
king
the
king
Assyria
Kings
Thus
saith
the
king
Let
not
Hezekiah
deceive
you
for
will
not
able
deliver
you
out
his
hand
Kings
neither
let
Hezekiah
make
you
trust
Jehovah
saying
Jehovah
will
surely
deliver
and
this
city
shall
not
given
into
the
hand
the
king
Assyria
Kings
Hearken
not
Hezekiah
for
thus
saith
the
king
Assyria
Make
your
peace
with
and
come
out
and
eat
every
one
his
vine
and
every
one
his
fig
tree
and
drink
every
one
the
waters
his
own
cistern
Kings
until
come
and
take
you
away
land
like
your
own
land
land
grain
and
new
wine
land
bread
and
vineyards
land
olive
trees
and
honey
that
may
live
and
not
die
and
hearken
not
unto
Hezekiah
when
persuadeth
you
saying
Jehovah
will
deliver
Kings
Hath
any
the
gods
the
nations
ever
delivered
his
land
out
the
hand
the
king
Assyria
Kings
Where
are
the
gods
Hamath
and
Arpad
where
are
the
gods
Sepharvaim
Hena
and
Ivvah
have
they
delivered
Samaria
out
hand
Kings
Who
are
they
among
all
the
gods
the
countries
that
have
delivered
their
country
out
hand
that
Jehovah
should
deliver
Jerusalem
out
hand
Kings
But
the
people
held
their
peace
and
answered
him
not
word
for
the
king
commandment
was
saying
Answer
him
not
Kings
Then
came
Eliakim
the
son
Hilkiah
who
was
over
the
household
and
Shebna
the
scribe
and
Joah
the
son
Asaph
the
recorder
Hezekiah
with
their
clothes
rent
and
told
him
the
words
Rabshakeh
Kings
And
came
pass
when
king
Hezekiah
heard
that
rent
his
clothes
and
covered
himself
with
sackcloth
and
went
into
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
And
sent
Eliakim
who
was
over
the
household
and
Shebna
the
scribe
and
the
elders
the
priests
covered
with
sackcloth
unto
Isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
Amoz
Kings
And
they
said
unto
him
Thus
saith
Hezekiah
This
day
day
trouble
and
rebuke
and
contumely
for
the
children
are
come
the
birth
and
there
not
strength
bring
forth
Kings
may
Jehovah
thy
God
will
hear
all
the
words
Rabshakeh
whom
the
king
Assyria
his
master
hath
sent
defy
the
living
God
and
will
rebuke
the
words
which
Jehovah
thy
God
hath
heard
wherefore
lift
thy
prayer
for
the
remnant
that
left
Kings
the
servants
king
Hezekiah
came
Isaiah
Kings
And
Isaiah
said
unto
them
Thus
shall
say
your
master
Thus
saith
Jehovah
not
afraid
the
words
that
thou
hast
heard
wherewith
the
servants
the
king
Assyria
have
blasphemed
Kings
Behold
will
put
spirit
him
and
shall
hear
tidings
and
shall
return
his
own
land
and
will
cause
him
fall
the
sword
his
own
land
Kings
Rabshakeh
returned
and
found
the
king
Assyria
warring
against
Libnah
for
had
heard
that
was
departed
from
Lachish
Kings
And
when
heard
say
Tirhakah
king
Ethiopia
Behold
come
out
fight
against
thee
sent
messengers
again
unto
Hezekiah
saying
Kings
Thus
shall
speak
Hezekiah
king
Judah
saying
Let
not
thy
God
whom
thou
trustest
deceive
thee
saying
Jerusalem
shall
not
given
into
the
hand
the
king
Assyria
Kings
Behold
thou
hast
heard
what
the
kings
Assyria
have
done
all
lands
destroying
them
utterly
and
shalt
thou
delivered
Kings
Have
the
gods
the
nations
delivered
them
which
fathers
have
destroyed
Gozan
and
Haran
and
Rezeph
and
the
children
Eden
that
were
Telassar
Kings
Where
the
king
Hamath
and
the
king
Arpad
and
the
king
the
city
Sepharvaim
Hena
and
Ivvah
Kings
And
Hezekiah
received
the
letter
from
the
hand
the
messengers
and
read
and
Hezekiah
went
unto
the
house
Jehovah
and
spread
before
Jehovah
Kings
And
Hezekiah
prayed
before
Jehovah
and
said
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
that
sittest
above
the
cherubim
thou
art
the
God
even
thou
alone
all
the
kingdoms
the
earth
thou
hast
made
heaven
and
earth
Kings
Incline
thine
ear
Jehovah
and
hear
open
thine
eyes
Jehovah
and
see
and
hear
the
words
Sennacherib
wherewith
hath
sent
him
defy
the
living
God
Kings
truth
Jehovah
the
kings
Assyria
have
laid
waste
the
nations
and
their
lands
Kings
and
have
cast
their
gods
into
the
fire
for
they
were
gods
but
the
work
men
hands
wood
and
stone
therefore
they
have
destroyed
them
Kings
Now
therefore
Jehovah
our
God
save
thou
beseech
thee
out
his
hand
that
all
the
kingdoms
the
earth
may
know
that
thou
Jehovah
art
God
alone
Kings
Then
Isaiah
the
son
Amoz
sent
Hezekiah
saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Whereas
thou
hast
prayed
against
Sennacherib
king
Assyria
have
heard
thee
Kings
This
the
word
that
Jehovah
hath
spoken
concerning
him
The
virgin
daughter
Zion
hath
despised
thee
and
laughed
thee
scorn
the
daughter
Jerusalem
hath
shaken
her
head
thee
Kings
Whom
hast
thou
defied
and
blasphemed
and
against
whom
hast
thou
exalted
thy
voice
and
lifted
thine
eyes
high
even
against
the
Holy
One
Israel
Kings
thy
messengers
thou
hast
defied
the
Lord
and
hast
said
With
the
multitude
chariots
come
the
height
the
mountains
the
innermost
parts
Lebanon
and
will
cut
down
the
tall
cedars
thereof
and
the
choice
fir
trees
thereof
and
will
enter
into
his
farthest
lodging
place
the
forest
his
fruitful
field
Kings
have
digged
and
drunk
strange
waters
and
with
the
sole
feet
will
dry
all
the
rivers
Egypt
Kings
Hast
thou
not
heard
how
have
done
long
ago
and
formed
ancient
times
now
have
brought
pass
that
should
thine
lay
waste
fortified
cities
into
ruinous
heaps
Kings
Therefore
their
inhabitants
were
small
power
they
were
dismayed
and
confounded
they
were
the
grass
the
field
and
the
green
herb
the
grass
the
housetops
and
grain
blasted
before
grown
Kings
But
know
thy
sitting
down
and
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
and
thy
raging
against
Kings
Because
thy
raging
against
and
because
thine
arrogancy
come
into
mine
ears
therefore
will
put
hook
thy
nose
and
bridle
thy
lips
and
will
turn
thee
back
the
way
which
thou
camest
Kings
And
this
shall
the
sign
unto
thee
shall
eat
this
year
that
which
groweth
itself
and
the
second
year
that
which
springeth
the
same
and
the
third
year
sow
and
reap
and
plant
vineyards
and
eat
the
fruit
thereof
Kings
And
the
remnant
that
escaped
the
house
Judah
shall
again
take
root
downward
and
bear
fruit
upward
Kings
For
out
Jerusalem
shall
forth
remnant
and
out
mount
Zion
they
that
shall
escape
the
zeal
Jehovah
shall
perform
this
Kings
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
concerning
the
king
Assyria
shall
not
come
unto
this
city
nor
shoot
arrow
there
neither
shall
come
before
with
shield
nor
cast
mound
against
Kings
the
way
that
came
the
same
shall
return
and
shall
not
come
unto
this
city
saith
Jehovah
Kings
For
will
defend
this
city
save
for
mine
own
sake
and
for
servant
David
sake
Kings
And
came
pass
that
night
that
the
angel
Jehovah
went
forth
and
smote
the
camp
the
Assyrians
hundred
fourscore
and
five
thousand
and
when
men
arose
early
the
morning
behold
these
were
all
dead
bodies
Kings
Sennacherib
king
Assyria
departed
and
went
and
returned
and
dwelt
Nineveh
Kings
And
came
pass
was
worshipping
the
house
Nisroch
his
god
that
Adrammelech
and
Sharezer
smote
him
with
the
sword
and
they
escaped
into
the
land
Ararat
And
Esar
haddon
his
son
reigned
his
stead
Kings
those
days
was
Hezekiah
sick
unto
death
And
Isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
Amoz
came
him
and
said
unto
him
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Set
thy
house
order
for
thou
shalt
die
and
not
live
Kings
Then
turned
his
face
the
wall
and
prayed
unto
Jehovah
saying
Kings
Remember
now
Jehovah
beseech
thee
how
have
walked
before
thee
truth
and
with
perfect
heart
and
have
done
that
which
good
thy
sight
And
Hezekiah
wept
sore
Kings
And
came
pass
before
Isaiah
was
gone
out
into
the
middle
part
the
city
that
the
word
Jehovah
came
him
saying
Kings
Turn
back
and
say
Hezekiah
the
prince
people
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
David
thy
father
have
heard
thy
prayer
have
seen
thy
tears
behold
will
heal
thee
the
third
day
thou
shalt
unto
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
And
will
add
unto
thy
days
fifteen
years
and
will
deliver
thee
and
this
city
out
the
hand
the
king
Assyria
and
will
defend
this
city
for
mine
own
sake
and
for
servant
David
sake
Kings
And
Isaiah
said
Take
cake
figs
And
they
took
and
laid
the
boil
and
recovered
Kings
And
Hezekiah
said
unto
Isaiah
What
shall
the
sign
that
Jehovah
will
heal
and
that
shall
unto
the
house
Jehovah
the
third
day
Kings
And
Isaiah
said
This
shall
the
sign
unto
thee
from
Jehovah
that
Jehovah
will
the
thing
that
hath
spoken
shall
the
shadow
forward
ten
steps
back
ten
steps
Kings
And
Hezekiah
answered
light
thing
for
the
shadow
decline
ten
steps
nay
but
let
the
shadow
return
backward
ten
steps
Kings
And
Isaiah
the
prophet
cried
unto
Jehovah
and
brought
the
shadow
ten
steps
backward
which
had
gone
down
the
dial
Ahaz
Kings
that
time
Berodach
baladan
the
son
Baladan
king
Babylon
sent
letters
and
present
unto
Hezekiah
for
had
heard
that
Hezekiah
had
been
sick
Kings
And
Hezekiah
hearkened
unto
them
and
showed
them
all
the
house
his
precious
things
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
spices
and
the
precious
oil
and
the
house
his
armor
and
all
that
was
found
his
treasures
there
was
nothing
his
house
nor
all
his
dominion
that
Hezekiah
showed
them
not
Kings
Then
came
Isaiah
the
prophet
unto
king
Hezekiah
and
said
unto
him
What
said
these
men
and
from
whence
came
they
unto
thee
And
Hezekiah
said
They
are
come
from
far
country
even
from
Babylon
Kings
And
said
What
have
they
seen
thy
house
And
Hezekiah
answered
All
that
house
have
they
seen
there
nothing
among
treasures
that
have
not
showed
them
Kings
And
Isaiah
said
unto
Hezekiah
Hear
the
word
Jehovah
Kings
Behold
the
days
come
that
all
that
thy
house
and
that
which
thy
fathers
have
laid
store
unto
this
day
shall
carried
Babylon
nothing
shall
left
saith
Jehovah
Kings
And
thy
sons
that
shall
issue
from
thee
whom
thou
shalt
beget
shall
they
take
away
and
they
shall
eunuchs
the
palace
the
king
Babylon
Kings
Then
said
Hezekiah
unto
Isaiah
Good
the
word
Jehovah
which
thou
hast
spoken
said
moreover
not
peace
and
truth
shall
days
Kings
Now
the
rest
the
acts
Hezekiah
and
all
his
might
and
how
made
the
pool
and
the
conduit
and
brought
water
into
the
city
are
they
not
written
the
book
the
chronicles
the
kings
Judah
Kings
And
Hezekiah
slept
with
his
fathers
and
Manasseh
his
son
reigned
his
stead
Kings
Manasseh
was
twelve
years
old
when
began
reign
and
reigned
five
and
fifty
years
Jerusalem
and
his
mother
name
was
Hephzibah
Kings
And
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
after
the
abominations
the
nations
whom
Jehovah
cast
out
before
the
children
Israel
Kings
For
built
again
the
high
places
which
Hezekiah
his
father
had
destroyed
and
reared
altars
for
Baal
and
made
Asherah
did
Ahab
king
Israel
and
worshipped
all
the
host
heaven
and
served
them
Kings
And
built
altars
the
house
Jehovah
whereof
Jehovah
said
Jerusalem
will
put
name
Kings
And
built
altars
for
all
the
host
heaven
the
two
courts
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
And
made
his
son
pass
through
the
fire
and
practised
augury
and
used
enchantments
and
dealt
with
them
that
had
familiar
spirits
and
with
wizards
wrought
much
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
provoke
him
anger
Kings
And
set
the
graven
image
Asherah
that
had
made
the
house
which
Jehovah
said
David
and
Solomon
his
son
this
house
and
Jerusalem
which
have
chosen
out
all
the
tribes
Israel
will
put
name
for
ever
Kings
neither
will
cause
the
feet
Israel
wander
any
more
out
the
land
which
gave
their
fathers
only
they
will
observe
according
all
that
have
commanded
them
and
according
all
the
law
that
servant
Moses
commanded
them
Kings
But
they
hearkened
not
and
Manasseh
seduced
them
that
which
evil
more
than
did
the
nations
whom
Jehovah
destroyed
before
the
children
Israel
Kings
And
Jehovah
spake
his
servants
the
prophets
saying
Kings
Because
Manasseh
king
Judah
hath
done
these
abominations
and
hath
done
wickedly
above
all
that
the
Amorites
did
that
were
before
him
and
hath
made
Judah
also
sin
with
his
idols
Kings
therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Behold
bring
such
evil
upon
Jerusalem
and
Judah
that
whosoever
heareth
both
his
ears
shall
tingle
Kings
And
will
stretch
over
Jerusalem
the
line
Samaria
and
the
plummet
the
house
Ahab
and
will
wipe
Jerusalem
man
wipeth
dish
wiping
and
turning
upside
down
Kings
And
will
cast
off
the
remnant
mine
inheritance
and
deliver
them
into
the
hand
their
enemies
and
they
shall
become
prey
and
spoil
all
their
enemies
Kings
because
they
have
done
that
which
evil
sight
and
have
provoked
anger
since
the
day
their
fathers
came
forth
out
Egypt
even
unto
this
day
Kings
Moreover
Manasseh
shed
innocent
blood
very
much
till
had
filled
Jerusalem
from
one
end
another
besides
his
sin
wherewith
made
Judah
sin
doing
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
Kings
Now
the
rest
the
acts
Manasseh
and
all
that
did
and
his
sin
that
sinned
are
they
not
written
the
book
the
chronicles
the
kings
Judah
Kings
And
Manasseh
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
the
garden
his
own
house
the
garden
Uzza
and
Amon
his
son
reigned
his
stead
Kings
Amon
was
twenty
and
two
years
old
when
began
reign
and
reigned
two
years
Jerusalem
and
his
mother
name
was
Meshullemeth
the
daughter
Haruz
Jotbah
Kings
And
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
did
Manasseh
his
father
Kings
And
walked
all
the
way
that
his
father
walked
and
served
the
idols
that
his
father
served
and
worshipped
them
Kings
and
forsook
Jehovah
the
God
his
fathers
and
walked
not
the
way
Jehovah
Kings
And
the
servants
Amon
conspired
against
him
and
put
the
king
death
his
own
house
Kings
But
the
people
the
land
slew
all
them
that
had
conspired
against
king
Amon
and
the
people
the
land
made
Josiah
his
son
king
his
stead
Kings
Now
the
rest
the
acts
Amon
which
did
are
they
not
written
the
book
the
chronicles
the
kings
Judah
Kings
And
was
buried
his
sepulchre
the
garden
Uzza
and
Josiah
his
son
reigned
his
stead
Kings
Josiah
was
eight
years
old
when
began
reign
and
reigned
thirty
and
one
years
Jerusalem
and
his
mother
name
was
Jedidah
the
daughter
Adaiah
Bozkath
Kings
And
did
that
which
was
right
the
eyes
Jehovah
and
walked
all
the
way
David
his
father
and
turned
not
aside
the
right
hand
the
left
Kings
And
came
pass
the
eighteenth
year
king
Josiah
that
the
king
sent
Shaphan
the
son
Azaliah
the
son
Meshullam
the
scribe
the
house
Jehovah
saying
Kings
Hilkiah
the
high
priest
that
may
sum
the
money
which
brought
into
the
house
Jehovah
which
the
keepers
the
threshold
have
gathered
the
people
Kings
and
let
them
deliver
into
the
hand
the
workmen
that
have
the
oversight
the
house
Jehovah
and
let
them
give
the
workmen
that
are
the
house
Jehovah
repair
the
breaches
the
house
Kings
unto
the
carpenters
and
the
builders
and
the
masons
and
for
buying
timber
and
hewn
stone
repair
the
house
Kings
Howbeit
there
was
reckoning
made
with
them
the
money
that
was
delivered
into
their
hand
for
they
dealt
faithfully
Kings
And
Hilkiah
the
high
priest
said
unto
Shaphan
the
scribe
have
found
the
book
the
law
the
house
Jehovah
And
Hilkiah
delivered
the
book
Shaphan
and
read
Kings
And
Shaphan
the
scribe
came
the
king
and
brought
the
king
word
again
and
said
Thy
servants
have
emptied
out
the
money
that
was
found
the
house
and
have
delivered
into
the
hand
the
workmen
that
have
the
oversight
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
And
Shaphan
the
scribe
told
the
king
saying
Hilkiah
the
priest
hath
delivered
book
And
Shaphan
read
before
the
king
Kings
And
came
pass
when
the
king
had
heard
the
words
the
book
the
law
that
rent
his
clothes
Kings
And
the
king
commanded
Hilkiah
the
priest
and
Ahikam
the
son
Shaphan
and
Achbor
the
son
Micaiah
and
Shaphan
the
scribe
and
Asaiah
the
king
servant
saying
Kings
inquire
Jehovah
for
and
for
the
people
and
for
all
Judah
concerning
the
words
this
book
that
found
for
great
the
wrath
Jehovah
that
kindled
against
because
our
fathers
have
not
hearkened
unto
the
words
this
book
according
unto
all
that
which
written
concerning
Kings
Hilkiah
the
priest
and
Ahikam
and
Achbor
and
Shaphan
and
Asaiah
went
unto
Huldah
the
prophetess
the
wife
Shallum
the
son
Tikvah
the
son
Harhas
keeper
the
wardrobe
now
she
dwelt
Jerusalem
the
second
quarter
and
they
communed
with
her
Kings
And
she
said
unto
them
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Tell
the
man
that
sent
you
unto
Kings
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
will
bring
evil
upon
this
place
and
upon
the
inhabitants
thereof
even
all
the
words
the
book
which
the
king
Judah
hath
read
Kings
Because
they
have
forsaken
and
have
burned
incense
unto
other
gods
that
they
might
provoke
anger
with
all
the
work
their
hands
therefore
wrath
shall
kindled
against
this
place
and
shall
not
quenched
Kings
But
unto
the
king
Judah
who
sent
you
inquire
Jehovah
thus
shall
say
him
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
touching
the
words
which
thou
hast
heard
Kings
because
thy
heart
was
tender
and
thou
didst
humble
thyself
before
Jehovah
when
thou
heardest
what
spake
against
this
place
and
against
the
inhabitants
thereof
that
they
should
become
desolation
and
curse
and
hast
rent
thy
clothes
and
wept
before
also
have
heard
thee
saith
Jehovah
Kings
Therefore
behold
will
gather
thee
thy
fathers
and
thou
shalt
gathered
thy
grave
peace
neither
shall
thine
eyes
see
all
the
evil
which
will
bring
upon
this
place
And
they
brought
the
king
word
again
Kings
And
the
king
sent
and
they
gathered
unto
him
all
the
elders
Judah
and
Jerusalem
Kings
And
the
king
went
the
house
Jehovah
and
all
the
men
Judah
and
all
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
with
him
and
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
both
small
and
great
and
read
their
ears
all
the
words
the
book
the
covenant
which
was
found
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
And
the
king
stood
the
pillar
and
made
covenant
before
Jehovah
walk
after
Jehovah
and
keep
his
commandments
and
his
testimonies
and
his
statutes
with
all
his
heart
and
all
his
soul
confirm
the
words
this
covenant
that
were
written
this
book
and
all
the
people
stood
the
covenant
Kings
And
the
king
commanded
Hilkiah
the
high
priest
and
the
priests
the
second
order
and
the
keepers
the
threshold
bring
forth
out
the
temple
Jehovah
all
the
vessels
that
were
made
for
Baal
and
for
the
Asherah
and
for
all
the
host
heaven
and
burned
them
without
Jerusalem
the
fields
the
Kidron
and
carried
the
ashes
them
unto
Beth
Kings
And
put
down
the
idolatrous
priests
whom
the
kings
Judah
had
ordained
burn
incense
the
high
places
the
cities
Judah
and
the
places
round
about
Jerusalem
them
also
that
burned
incense
unto
Baal
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
planets
and
all
the
host
heaven
Kings
And
brought
out
the
Asherah
from
the
house
Jehovah
without
Jerusalem
unto
the
brook
Kidron
and
burned
the
brook
Kidron
and
beat
dust
and
cast
the
dust
thereof
upon
the
graves
the
common
people
Kings
And
brake
down
the
houses
the
sodomites
that
were
the
house
Jehovah
where
the
women
wove
hangings
for
the
Asherah
Kings
And
brought
all
the
priests
out
the
cities
Judah
and
defiled
the
high
places
where
the
priests
had
burned
incense
from
Geba
Beer
sheba
and
brake
down
the
high
places
the
gates
that
were
the
entrance
the
gate
Joshua
the
governor
the
city
which
were
man
left
hand
the
gate
the
city
Kings
Nevertheless
the
priests
the
high
places
came
not
the
altar
Jehovah
Jerusalem
but
they
did
eat
unleavened
bread
among
their
brethren
Kings
And
defiled
Topheth
which
the
valley
the
children
Hinnom
that
man
might
make
his
son
his
daughter
pass
through
the
fire
Molech
Kings
And
took
away
the
horses
that
the
kings
Judah
had
given
the
sun
the
entrance
the
house
Jehovah
the
chamber
Nathan
melech
the
chamberlain
which
was
the
precincts
and
burned
the
chariots
the
sun
with
fire
Kings
And
the
altars
that
were
the
roof
the
upper
chamber
Ahaz
which
the
kings
Judah
had
made
and
the
altars
which
Manasseh
had
made
the
two
courts
the
house
Jehovah
did
the
king
break
down
and
beat
them
down
from
thence
and
cast
the
dust
them
into
the
brook
Kidron
Kings
And
the
high
places
that
were
before
Jerusalem
which
were
the
right
hand
the
mount
corruption
which
Solomon
the
king
Israel
had
builded
for
Ashtoreth
the
abomination
the
Sidonians
and
for
Chemosh
the
abomination
Moab
and
for
Milcom
the
abomination
the
children
Ammon
did
the
king
defile
Kings
And
brake
pieces
the
pillars
and
cut
down
the
Asherim
and
filled
their
places
with
the
bones
men
Kings
Moreover
the
altar
that
was
Beth
and
the
high
place
which
Jeroboam
the
son
Nebat
who
made
Israel
sin
had
made
even
that
altar
and
the
high
place
brake
down
and
burned
the
high
place
and
beat
dust
and
burned
the
Asherah
Kings
And
Josiah
turned
himself
spied
the
sepulchres
that
were
there
the
mount
and
sent
and
took
the
bones
out
the
sepulchres
and
burned
them
upon
the
altar
and
defiled
according
the
word
Jehovah
which
the
man
God
proclaimed
who
proclaimed
these
things
Kings
Then
said
What
monument
that
which
see
And
the
men
the
city
told
him
the
sepulchre
the
man
God
who
came
from
Judah
and
proclaimed
these
things
that
thou
hast
done
against
the
altar
Beth
Kings
And
said
Let
him
let
man
move
his
bones
they
let
his
bones
alone
with
the
bones
the
prophet
that
came
out
Samaria
Kings
And
all
the
houses
also
the
high
places
that
were
the
cities
Samaria
which
the
kings
Israel
had
made
provoke
Jehovah
anger
Josiah
took
away
and
did
them
according
all
the
acts
that
had
done
Beth
Kings
And
slew
all
the
priests
the
high
places
that
were
there
upon
the
altars
and
burned
men
bones
upon
them
and
returned
Jerusalem
Kings
And
the
king
commanded
all
the
people
saying
Keep
the
passover
unto
Jehovah
your
God
written
this
book
the
covenant
Kings
Surely
there
was
not
kept
such
passover
from
the
days
the
judges
that
judged
Israel
nor
all
the
days
the
kings
Israel
nor
the
kings
Judah
Kings
but
the
eighteenth
year
king
Josiah
was
this
passover
kept
Jehovah
Jerusalem
Kings
Moreover
them
that
had
familiar
spirits
and
the
wizards
and
the
teraphim
and
the
idols
and
all
the
abominations
that
were
seen
the
land
Judah
and
Jerusalem
did
Josiah
put
away
that
might
confirm
the
words
the
law
which
were
written
the
book
that
Hilkiah
the
priest
found
the
house
Jehovah
Kings
And
like
unto
him
was
there
king
before
him
that
turned
Jehovah
with
all
his
heart
and
with
all
his
soul
and
with
all
his
might
according
all
the
law
Moses
neither
after
him
arose
there
any
like
him
Kings
Notwithstanding
Jehovah
turned
not
from
the
fierceness
his
great
wrath
wherewith
his
anger
was
kindled
against
Judah
because
all
the
provocations
wherewith
Manasseh
had
provoked
him
Kings
And
Jehovah
said
will
remove
Judah
also
out
sight
have
removed
Israel
and
will
cast
off
this
city
which
have
chosen
even
Jerusalem
and
the
house
which
said
name
shall
there
Kings
Now
the
rest
the
acts
Josiah
and
all
that
did
are
they
not
written
the
book
the
chronicles
the
kings
Judah
Kings
his
days
Pharaoh
necoh
king
Egypt
went
against
the
king
Assyria
the
river
Euphrates
and
king
Josiah
went
against
him
and
Pharaoh
necoh
slew
him
Megiddo
when
had
seen
him
Kings
And
his
servants
carried
him
chariot
dead
from
Megiddo
and
brought
him
Jerusalem
and
buried
him
his
own
sepulchre
And
the
people
the
land
took
Jehoahaz
the
son
Josiah
and
anointed
him
and
made
him
king
his
father

Thus
the

had
war
those

Jehovah
had
given

For
said
unto
Judah
Let

cried
unto

Jehovah
smote

before
Judah
and
the
Ethiopians
fled
Chronicles
And
Asa
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
pursued
them
unto
Gerar
and
there
fell
the
Ethiopians
many
that
they
could
not
recover
themselves
for
they
were
destroyed
before
Jehovah
and
before
his
host
and
they
carried
away
very
much
booty
Chronicles
And
they
smote
all
the
cities
round
about

the
fear
Jehovah
came
upon

they
despoiled

Now
for
long
season
Israel
was
without
the
true
God
and
without

without
law
Chronicles
but
when
their
distress
they
turned
unto
Jehovah
the
God

and
sought
him
was
found
them

And
those
times
there
was
peace
him
that
went
out

great
vexations
were
upon
all
the
inhabitants
the

And
they
were
broken
pieces

But
strong

hands
slack

your
work

And
when
Asa
heard
these
words
and
the
prophecy
Oded
the
prophet
took
courage
and
put
away
the
abominations
out
all
the
land
Judah

their
heart

sought
him
with
their
whole
desire

was
found

and
Jehovah
gave
them
rest
round
about
Chronicles
And
also
Maacah
the
mother

Because

And
the
king
Israel
said
Jehoshaphat
Did

And
Micaiah
said
Therefore

Now
therefore

Then

his
mother
was
his
counsellor
wickedly
Chronicles
And
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
did
the
house
Ahab
for
they
were
his
counsellors
after
the
death
his

Judah
went
down

And
came
pass
when
Jehu

him
Jehu

slew
him

they
buried
him

sought
Jehovah
with
all

And
the
house
Ahaziah
had
power
hold
the

Now
when

Ahaziah
saw
that
her

seven
years

sheba
Chronicles
And
Joash
did
that
which
was
right
the
eyes
Jehovah
all
the
days
Jehoiada
the
priest
Chronicles
And
Jehoiada
took
for
him
two
wives
and
begat
sons
and
daughters
Chronicles
And
came
pass
after
this
that
Joash
was
minded
restore
the
house
Jehovah
Chronicles
And
gathered
together
the
priests
and
the
Levites
and
said
them
out
unto
the
cities
Judah
and
gather
all
Israel
money
repair
the
house
your
God
from
year
year
and
see
that
hasten
the
matter
Howbeit
the
Levites
hastened
not
Chronicles
And
the
king
called
for
Jehoiada
the
chief
and
said
unto
him
Why
hast
thou
not
required
the
Levites
bring
out
Judah
and
out
Jerusalem
the
tax
Moses
the
servant
Jehovah
and
the
assembly
Israel
for
the
tent
the
testimony
Chronicles
For
the
sons
Athaliah
that
wicked
woman
had
broken
the
house
God
and
also
all
the
dedicated
things
the
house
Jehovah
did
they
bestow
upon
the
Baalim
Chronicles
the
king
commanded
and
they
made
chest
and
set
without
the
gate
the
house
Jehovah
Chronicles
And
they
made
proclamation
through
Judah
and
Jerusalem
bring
for
Jehovah
the
tax
that
Moses
the
servant
God
laid
upon
Israel
the
wilderness
Chronicles
And
all
the
princes
and
all
the
people
rejoiced
and
brought
and
cast
into
the
chest
until
they
had
made
end
Chronicles
And
was
that
what
time
the
chest
was
brought
unto
the
king
officers
the
hand
the
Levites
and
when
they
saw
that
there
was
much
money
the
king
scribe
and
the
chief
priest
officer
came
and
emptied
the
chest
and
took
and
carried
its
place
again
Thus
they
did
day
day
and
gathered
money
abundance
Chronicles
And
the
king
and
Jehoiada
gave
such
did
the
work
the
service
the
house
Jehovah
and
they
hired
masons
and
carpenters
restore
the
house
Jehovah
and
also
such
wrought
iron
and
brass
repair
the
house
Jehovah
Chronicles
the
workmen
wrought
and
the
work
repairing
went
forward
their
hands
and
they
set
the
house
God
its
state
and
strengthened
Chronicles
And
when
they
had
made
end
they
brought
the
rest
the
money
before
the
king
and
Jehoiada
whereof
were
made
vessels
for
the
house
Jehovah
even
vessels
wherewith
minister
and
offer
and
spoons
and
vessels
gold
and
silver
And
they
offered
burnt
offerings
the
house
Jehovah
continually
all
the
days
Jehoiada
Chronicles
But
Jehoiada
waxed
old
and
was
full
days
and
died
hundred
and
thirty
years
old
was
when
died
Chronicles
And
they
buried
him
the
city
David
among
the
kings
because
had
done
good
Israel
and
toward
God
and
his
house
Chronicles
Now
after
the
death
Jehoiada
came
the
princes
Judah
and
made
obeisance
the
king
Then
the
king
hearkened
unto
them
Chronicles
And
they
forsook
the
house
Jehovah
the
God
their
fathers
and
served
the
Asherim
and
the
idols
and
wrath
came
upon
Judah
and
Jerusalem
for
this
their
guiltiness
Chronicles
Yet
sent
prophets
them
bring
them
again
unto
Jehovah
and
they
testified
against
them
but
they
would
not
give
ear
Chronicles
And
the
Spirit
God
came
upon
Zechariah
the
son
Jehoiada
the
priest
and
stood
above
the
people
and
said
unto
them
Thus
saith
God
Why
transgress
the
commandments
Jehovah
that
cannot
prosper
because
have
forsaken
Jehovah
hath
also
forsaken
you
Chronicles
And
they
conspired
against
him
and
stoned
him
with
stones
the
commandment
the
king
the
court
the
house
Jehovah
Chronicles
Thus
Joash
the
king
remembered
not
the
kindness
which
Jehoiada
his
father
had
done
him
but
slew
his
son
And
when
died
said
Jehovah
look
upon
and
require
Chronicles
And
came
pass
the
end
the
year
that
the
army
the
Syrians
came
against
him
and
they
came
Judah
and
Jerusalem
and
destroyed
all
the
princes
the
people
from
among
the
people
and
sent
all
the
spoil
them
unto
the
king
Damascus
Chronicles
For
the
army
the
Syrians
came
with
small
company
men
and
Jehovah
delivered
very
great
host
into
their
hand
because
they
had
forsaken
Jehovah
the
God
their
fathers
they
executed
judgment
upon
Joash
Chronicles
And
when
they
were
departed
for
him
for
they
left
him
very
sick
his
own
servants
conspired
against
him
for
the
blood
the
sons
Jehoiada
the
priest
and
slew
him
his
bed
and
died
and
they
buried
him
the
city
David
but
they
buried
him
not
the
sepulchres
the
kings
Chronicles
And
these
are
they
that
conspired
against
him
Zabad
the
son
Shimeath
the
Ammonitess
and
Jehozabad
the
son
Shimrith
the
Moabitess
Chronicles
Now
concerning
his
sons
and
the
greatness
the
burdens
laid
upon
him
and
the
rebuilding
the
house
God
behold
they
are
written
the
commentary
the
book
the
kings
And
Amaziah
his
son
reigned
his
stead
Chronicles
Amaziah
was
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
began
reign
and
reigned
twenty
and
nine
years
Jerusalem
and
his
mother
name
was
Jehoaddan
Jerusalem
Chronicles
And
did
that
which
was
right
the
eyes
Jehovah
but
not
with
perfect
heart
Chronicles
Now
came
pass
when
the
kingdom
was
established
unto
him
that
slew
his
servants
that
had
killed
the
king
his
father
Chronicles
But
put
not
their
children
death
but
did
according
that
which
written
the
law
the
book
Moses
Jehovah
commanded
saying
The
fathers
shall
not
die
for
the
children
neither
shall
the
children
die
for
the
fathers
but
every
man
shall
die
for
his
own
sin
Chronicles
Moreover
Amaziah
gathered
Judah
together
and
ordered
them
according
their
fathers
houses
under
captains
thousands
and
captains
hundreds
even
all
Judah
and
Benjamin
and
numbered
them
from
twenty
years
old
and
upward
and
found
them
three
hundred
thousand
chosen
men
able
forth
war
that
could
handle
spear
and
shield
Chronicles
hired
also
hundred
thousand
mighty
men
valor
out
Israel
for
hundred
talents
silver
Chronicles
But
there
came
man
God
him
saying
king
let
not
the
army
Israel
with
thee
for
Jehovah
not
with
Israel
wit
with
all
the
children
Ephraim
Chronicles
But
thou
wilt
valiantly
strong
for
the
battle
God
will
cast
thee
down
before
the
enemy
for
God
hath
power
help
and
cast
down
Chronicles
And
Amaziah
said
the
man
God
But
what
shall
for
the
hundred
talents
which
have
given
the
army
Israel
And
the
man
God
answered
Jehovah
able
give
thee
much
more
than
this
Chronicles
Then
Amaziah
separated
them
wit
the
army
that
was
come
him
out
Ephraim
home
again
wherefore
their
anger
was
greatly
kindled
against
Judah
and
they
returned
home
fierce
anger
Chronicles
And
Amaziah
took
courage
and
led
forth
his
people
and
went
the
Valley
Salt
and
smote
the
children
Seir
ten
thousand
Chronicles
And
other
ten
thousand
did
the
children
Judah
carry
away
alive
and
brought
them
unto
the
top
the
rock
and
cast
them
down
from
the
top
the
rock
that
they
all
were
broken
pieces
Chronicles
But
the
men
the
army
whom
Amaziah
sent
back
that
they
should
not
with
him
battle
fell
upon
the
cities
Judah
from
Samaria
even
unto
Beth
horon
and
smote
them
three
thousand
and
took
much
spoil
Chronicles
Now
came
pass
after
that
Amaziah
was
come
from
the
slaughter
the
Edomites
that
brought
the
gods
the
children
Seir
and
set
them
his
gods
and
bowed
down
himself
before
them
and
burned
incense
unto
them
Chronicles
Wherefore
the
anger
Jehovah
was
kindled
against
Amaziah
and
sent
unto
him
prophet
who
said
unto
him
Why
hast
thou
sought
after
the
gods
the
people
which
have
not
delivered
their
own
people
out
thy
hand
Chronicles
And
came
pass
talked
with
him
that
the
king
said
unto
him
Have
made
thee
the
king
counsel
forbear
why
shouldest
thou
smitten
Then
the
prophet
forbare
and
said
know
that
God
hath
determined
destroy
thee
because
thou
hast
done
this
and
hast
not
hearkened
unto
counsel
Chronicles
Then
Amaziah
king
Judah
took
advice
and
sent
Joash
the
son
Jehoahaz
the
son
Jehu
king
Israel
saying
Come
let
look
one
another
the
face
Chronicles
And
Joash
king
Israel
sent
Amaziah
king
Judah
saying
The
thistle
that
was
Lebanon
sent
the
cedar
that
was
Lebanon
saying
Give
thy
daughter
son
wife
and
there
passed
wild
beast
that
was
Lebanon
and
trod
down
the
thistle
Chronicles
Thou
sayest
thou
hast
smitten
Edom
and
thy
heart
lifteth
thee
boast
abide
now
home
why
shouldest
thou
meddle
thy
hurt
that
thou
shouldest
fall
even
thou
and
Judah
with
thee
Chronicles
But
Amaziah
would
not
hear
for
was
God
that
might
deliver
them
into
the
hand
their
enemies
because
they
had
sought
after
the
gods
Edom
Chronicles
Joash
king
Israel
went
and
and
Amaziah
king
Judah
looked
one
another
the
face
Beth
shemesh
which
belongeth
Judah
Chronicles
And
Judah
was
put
the
worse
before
Israel
and
they
fled
every
man
his
tent
Chronicles
And
Joash
king
Israel
took
Amaziah
king
Judah
the
son
Joash
the
son
Jehoahaz
Beth
shemesh
and
brought
him
Jerusalem
and
brake
down
the
wall
Jerusalem
from
the
gate
Ephraim
unto
the
corner

four
hundred
cubits

And
took
all
the
gold

all
the
vessels
that
were
found
the
house
God
with
Obed
edom
and
the
treasures
the
king
house
the
hostages
also
and
returned
Samaria
Chronicles
And
Amaziah
the
son
Joash
king
Judah
lived
after
the
death
Joash
son
Jehoahaz
king
Israel
fifteen
years
Chronicles
Now
the
rest
the
acts
Amaziah
first
and
last
behold
are
they
not
written
the
book
the
kings
Judah
and
Israel
Chronicles
Now
from
the
time
that
Amaziah
did
turn
away
from
following
Jehovah
they
made
conspiracy
against
him
Jerusalem
and
fled
Lachish
but
they
sent
after
him

And
Ahaz
gathered
together
the

For

rested
themselves
upon

words
Hezekiah

Judah
Chronicles
After
this
did
Sennacherib

send
his

unto

Hath
not
the

Hezekiah
taken

Sennacherib

Hezekiah
rendered

Notwithstanding
Hezekiah
humbled

also
stopped
the
upper
spring

From

the

began
they

but
the

Now

the

their

and
appointed
the

And
all

for

Now
when
the

heard
that

Then

And
came

Ezra
And

and
the

were
weighed

into

hand
Meremoth
the

Uriah
the

Ezra
Now
when

the

drew

unto
saying
The

the
Canaanites
the
Hittites
the
Perizzites
the
Jebusites

Moabites
the
Egyptians

Ezra
For

have
taken
their

for
themselves
and
for
their

that
the

seed
have
mingled
themselves
with
the
peoples
the
lands
yea
the

the

Ezra
And
when

plucked
off
the

confounded
Ezra
Then

because
the
trespass

And
the

fell
upon

and
spread

unto
Jehovah
God
Ezra
and
said
God
ashamed
and
blush
lift
face
thee
God
for
our
iniquities
are
increased
over
our
head
and
our
guiltiness
grown
unto
the
heavens
Ezra
Since
the
days
our
fathers
have
been
exceeding
guilty
unto
this
day
and
for
our
iniquities
have
our
kings
and
our

been
delivered
into
the
hand
the
kings

the
sword
captivity
and
plunder
and
confusion
face
this

Ezra
And
now
for

moment
grace
hath
been
showed
from

our

leave
remnant
escape
and
give
nail
his
holy
place
that
our
God
may
lighten
our
eyes
and
give
little
reviving
our
bondage
Ezra
For
are
bondmen
yet
our
God
hath
not
forsaken
our
bondage
but
hath
extended
lovingkindness
unto
the
sight
the
kings
Persia
give
reviving
set
the
house
our
God
and
repair
the
ruins
thereof
and
give
wall

and
Jerusalem
Ezra
And
now
our
God
what
shall
say
after
this
for
have
forsaken
thy
commandments
Ezra
which
thou
hast
commanded
thy
servants
the
prophets
saying
The
land
unto
which

unclean
land
through
the
uncleanness
the
peoples
the
lands
through
their
abominations
which
have
filled

one
end
another
with
their
filthiness
Ezra
now
therefore
give
not
your
daughters
unto
their
sons
neither
take
their
daughters
unto
your

nor
seek
their
peace
their
prosperity
for
ever
that

strong
and
eat
the
good
the
land
and
leave
for
inheritance
your
children
for
ever
Ezra
And
after
all
that
come
upon
for
our
evil
deeds
and
for
our
great
guilt
seeing
that
thou
our
God
hast
punished
less
than
our
iniquities
deserve
and
hast
given
such
remnant
Ezra
shall
again
break
thy
commandments
and
join
affinity
with
the
peoples
that
these
abominations
wouldest
not
thou
angry
with
till
thou
hadst
consumed
that
there
should

escape
Ezra
Jehovah

thou
art
righteous
for

And
between

But
came
pass
that
when
Sanballat
heard
that
were
building
the
wall
was
wroth
and
took
great
indignation
and
mocked
the
Jews
Nehemiah
And
spake
before
his
brethren
and
the
army
Samaria
and
said
What
are
these
feeble
Jews
doing
will
they
fortify
themselves
will
they
sacrifice
will
they
make
end
day
will
they
revive

stones
out

seeing

Nehemiah
Now
Tobiah
the
Ammonite
was
him
and
said
Even
that
which
they
are
building
fox
shall
break
down
their
stone
wall
Nehemiah
Hear
our
God
for
are
despised
and
turn
back
their
reproach
upon
their
own
head
and
give
them
for
spoil
land
captivity
Nehemiah
and
cover
not
their
iniquity
and
let
not
their
sin
blotted
out
from
before
thee
for
they
have
provoked
thee
anger
before
the
builders
Nehemiah
built
the
wall
and
all
the
wall
was
joined
together
unto
half
the
height
thereof
for
the
people
had
mind
work
Nehemiah
But
came
pass
that
when
Sanballat
and
Tobiah
and
the
Arabians
and
the
Ammonites
and
the
Ashdodites
heard
that
the
repairing
the
walls
Jerusalem
went
forward
and
that
the
breaches
began
stopped
then
they
were
very
wroth
Nehemiah
and
they
conspired
all
them
together
come
and
fight
against
Jerusalem
and
cause
confusion
therein
Nehemiah
But
made
our
prayer
unto
our
God
and
set
watch
against
them
day
and
night
because
them
Nehemiah
And
Judah
said
The
strength
the
bearers
burdens
decayed
and
there
much
rubbish
that
are
not
able
build
the
wall
Nehemiah
And
our
adversaries
said
They
shall
not
know
neither
see
till
come
into
the
midst
them
and
slay
them
and
cause
the
work
cease
Nehemiah
And
came
pass
that
when
the
Jews
that
dwelt
them
came
they
said
unto
ten
times
from
all
places
must
return
unto
Nehemiah
Therefore
set
the
lowest
parts
the
space
behind
the
wall
the
open
places
set
there
the
people
after
their
families
with
their
swords
their
spears
and
their
bows
Nehemiah
And
looked
and
rose
and
said
unto
the
nobles
and
the
rulers
and
the
rest
the
people
not
afraid
them
remember
the
Lord
who
great
and
terrible
and
fight
for
your
brethren
your
sons
and
your
daughters
your
wives
and
your
houses
Nehemiah
And
came
pass
when
our
enemies
heard
that
was
known
unto
and
God
had
brought
their
counsel
nought
that
returned
all
the
wall
every
one
unto
his
work
Nehemiah
And
came
pass
from
that
time
forth
that
half
servants
wrought
the
work
and
half
them
held
the
spears
the
shields
and
the
bows
and
the
coats
mail
and
the
rulers
were
behind
all
the
house
Judah
Nehemiah
They
all
builded
the
wall
and
they
that
bare
burdens
laded
themselves
every
one
with
one
his
hands
wrought
the
work
and
with
the
other
held
his
weapon
Nehemiah
and
the
builders
every
one
had
his
sword
girded
his
side
and
builded
And
that
sounded
the
trumpet
was
Nehemiah
And
said
unto
the
nobles
and
the
rulers
and
the
rest
the
people
The
work
great
and
large
and
are
separated
upon
the
wall
one
far
from
another
Nehemiah
what
place
soever
hear
the
sound
the
trumpet
resort
thither
unto
our
God
will
fight
for
Nehemiah
wrought
the
work
and
half
them
held
the
spears
from
the
rising
the
morning
till
the
stars
appeared
Nehemiah
Likewise
the
same
time
said
unto
the
people
Let
every
one
with
his
servant
lodge
within
Jerusalem
that
the
night
they
may
guard
and
may
labor
the
day
Nehemiah
neither
nor
brethren
nor
servants
nor
the
men
the
guard
that
followed
none
put
off
our
clothes
every
one
went
with
his
weapon
the
water
Nehemiah
Then
there
arose
great
cry
the
people
and
their
wives
against
their
brethren
the
Jews
Nehemiah
For
there
were
that
said
our
sons
and
our
daughters
are
many
let
get
grain
that
may
eat
and
live
Nehemiah
Some
also
there
were
that
said
are
mortgaging
our
fields
and
our
vineyards
and
our
houses
let
get
grain
because
the
dearth
Nehemiah
There
were
also
that
said
have
borrowed
money
for
the
king
tribute
upon
our
fields
and
our
vineyards
Nehemiah
Yet
now
our
flesh
the
flesh
our
brethren
our
children
their
children
and
bring
into
bondage
our
sons
and
our
daughters
servants
and
some
our
daughters
are
brought
into
bondage
already
neither
our
power
help
for
other
men
have
our
fields
and
our
vineyards
Nehemiah
And
was
very
angry
when
heard
their
cry
and
these
words
Nehemiah
Then
consulted
with
myself
and
contended
with
the
nobles
and
therulers
and
said
unto
them
exact
usury
every
one
his
brother
And
held
great
assembly
against
them
Nehemiah
And
said
unto
them
after
our
ability
have
redeemed
our
brethren
the
Jews
that
were
sold
unto
the
nations
and
would
even
sell
your
brethren
and
should
they
sold
unto
Then
held
they
their
peace
and
found
never
word
Nehemiah
Also
said
The
thing
that
not
good
ought
not
walk
the
fear
our
God
because
the
reproach
the
nations
our
enemies
Nehemiah
And
likewise
brethren
and
servants
lend
them
money
and
grain
pray
you
let
leave
off
this
usury
Nehemiah
Restore
pray
you
them
even
this
day
their
fields
their
vineyards
their
oliveyards
and
their
houses
also
the
hundredth
part
the
money
and
the
grain
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
that
exact
them
Nehemiah
Then
said
they
will
restore
them
and
will
require
nothing
them
will
even
thou
sayest
Then
called
the
priests
and
took
oath
them
that
they
would
according
this
promise
Nehemiah
Also
shook
out
lap
and
said
God
shake
out
every
man
from
his
house
and
from
his
labor
that
performeth
not
this
promise
even
thus
shaken
out
and
emptied
And
all
the
assembly
said
Amen
and
praised
Jehovah
And
the
people
did
according
this
promise
Nehemiah
Moreover
from
the
time
that
was
appointed
their
governor
the
land
Judah
from
the
twentieth
year
even
unto
the
two
and
thirtieth
year
Artaxerxes
the
king
that
twelve
years
and
brethren
have
not
eaten
the
bread
the
governor
Nehemiah
But
the
former
governors
that
were
before
were
chargeable
unto
the
people
and
took
them
bread
and
wine
besides
forty
shekels
silver
yea
even
their
servants
bare
rule
over
the
people
but
did
not
because
the
fear
God
Nehemiah
Yea
also
continued
the
work
this
wall
neither
bought
any
land
and
all
servants
were
gathered
thither
unto
the
work
Nehemiah
Moreover
there
were
table
the
Jews
and
the
rulers
hundred
and
fifty
men
besides
those
that
came
unto
from
among
the
nations
that
were
round
about
Nehemiah
Now
that
which
was
prepared
for
one
day
was
one
and
six
choice
sheep
also
fowls
were
prepared
for
and
once
ten
days
store
all
sorts
wine
yet
for
all
this
demanded
not
the
bread
the
governor
because
the
bondage
was
heavy
upon
this
people
Nehemiah
Remember
unto
God
for
good
all
that
have
done
for
this
people
Nehemiah
Now
came
pass
when
was
reported
Sanballat
and
Tobiah
and
Geshem
the
Arabian
and
unto
the
rest
our
enemies
that
had
builded
the
wall
and
that
there
was
breach
left
therein
though
even
unto
that
time
had
not
set
the
doors
the
gates
Nehemiah
that
Sanballat
and
Geshem
sent
unto
saying
Come
let
meet
together
one
the
villages
the
plain
Ono
But
they
thought
mischief
Nehemiah
And
sent
messengers
unto
them
saying
doing
great
work
that
cannot
come
down
why
should
the
work
cease
whilst
leave
and
come
down
you
Nehemiah
And
they
sent
unto
four
times
after
this
sort
and
answered
them
after
the
same
manner
Nehemiah
Then
sent
Sanballat
his
servant
unto
like
manner
the
fifth
time
with
open
letter
his
hand
Nehemiah
wherein
was
written
reported
among
the
nations
and
Gashmu
saith
that
thou
and
the
Jews
think
rebel
for
which
cause
thou
art
building
the
wall
and
thou
wouldest
their
king
according
these
words
Nehemiah
And
thou
hast
also
appointed
prophets
preach
thee
Jerusalem
saying
There
king
Judah
and
now
shall
reported
the
king
according
these
words
Come
now
therefore
and
let
take
counsel
together
Nehemiah
Then
sent
unto
him
saying
There
are
such
things
done
thou
sayest
but
thou
feignest
them
out
thine
own
heart
Nehemiah
For
they
all
would
have
made
afraid
saying
Their
hands
shall
weakened
from
the
work
that
not
done
But
now
God
strengthen
thou
hands
Nehemiah
And
went
unto
the
house
Shemaiah
the
son
Delaiah
the
son
Mehetabel
who
was
shut
and
said
Let
meet
together
the
house
God
within
the
temple
and
let
shut
the
doors
the
temple
for
they
will
come
slay
thee
yea
the
night
will
they
come
slay
thee
Nehemiah
And
said
Should
such
man
flee
and
who
there
that
being
such
would
into
the
temple
save
his
life
will
not
Nehemiah
And
discerned
and
God
had
not
sent
him
but
pronounced
this
prophecy
against
and
Tobiah
and
Sanballat
had
hired
him
Nehemiah
For
this
cause
was
hired
that
should
afraid
and
and
sin
and
that
they
might
have
matter
for
evil
report
that
they
might
reproach
Nehemiah
Remember
God
Tobiah
and
Sanballat
according
these
their
works
and
also
the
prophetess
Noadiah
and
the
rest
the
prophets
that
would
have
put
fear
Nehemiah
the
wall
was
finished
the
twenty
and
fifth
day
the
month
Elul
fifty
and
two
days
Nehemiah
And
came
pass
when
all
our
enemies
heard
thereof
that
all
the
nations
that
were
about
feared
and
were
much
cast
down
their
own
eyes
for
they
perceived
that
this
work
was
wrought
our
God
Nehemiah
Moreover
those
days
the
nobles
Judah
sent
many
letters
unto
Tobiah
and
the
letters
Tobiah
came
unto
them
Nehemiah
For
there
were
many
Judah
sworn
unto
him
because
was
the
son
law
Shecaniah
the
son
Arah
and
his
son
Jehohanan
had
taken
the
daughter
Meshullam
the
son
Berechiah
wife
Nehemiah
Also
they
spake
his
good
deeds
before
and
reported
words
him
And
Tobiah
sent
letters
put
fear
Nehemiah
Now
came
pass
when
the
wall
was
built
and
had
set
the
doors
and
the
porters
and
the
singers
and
the
Levites
were
appointed
Nehemiah
that
gave
brother
Hanani
and
Hananiah
the
governor
the
castle
charge
over
Jerusalem
for
was
faithful
man
and
feared
God
above
many
Nehemiah
And
said
unto
them
Let
not
the
gates
Jerusalem
opened
until
the
sun
hot
and
while
they
stand
guard
let
them
shut
the
doors
and
bar
them
and
appoint
watches
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
every
one
his
watch
and
every
one
over
against
his
house
Nehemiah
Now
the
city
was
wide
and
large
but
the
people
were
few
therein
and
the
houses
were
not
builded
Nehemiah
And
God
put
into
heart
gather
together
the
nobles
and
the
rulers
and
the
people
that
they
might
reckoned
genealogy
And
found
the
book
the
genealogy
them
that
came
the
first
and
found
written
therein
Nehemiah
These
are
the
children

who
didst
choose
Abram
and
broughtest
him
forth
out
the
Chaldees
and
gavest
him
the
name
Abraham

and
foundest
his
heart
faithful
before
thee
and
madest
covenant
with
him
give
the
land
the
Canaanite
the
Hittite
the
Amorite
and
the
Perizzite
and
the
Jebusite
and
the
Girgashite
give
unto
his
seed
and
hast
performed
thy
words
for
thou
art
righteous
Nehemiah
And
thou
sawest
the
affliction
our
fathers
Egypt
and
heardest
their
cry
the
Red
Sea
Nehemiah
and
showedst
signs
and
wonders
upon
Pharaoh
and
all
his
servants
and
all
the
people
his
land
for
thou
knewest
that
they
dealt
proudly
against
them
and
didst
get
thee
name
this
day
Nehemiah
And
thou
didst
divide
the
sea
before
them
that
they
went
through
the
midst
the
sea
the
dry
land
and
their
pursuers
thou
didst
cast
into
the
depths
stone
into
the
mighty
waters
Nehemiah
Moreover
pillar
cloud
thou
leddest
them
day
and
pillar
fire
night
give
them
light
the
way
wherein
they
should
Nehemiah
Thou
camest
down
also
upon
mount
Sinai
and
spakest
with
them
from
heaven
and
gavest
them
right
ordinances
and
true
laws
good
statutes
and
commandments
Nehemiah
and
madest
known
unto
them
thy
holy
sabbath
and
commandedst
them
commandments
and
statutes
and
law
Moses
thy
servant
Nehemiah
and
gavest
them
bread
from
heaven
for
their
hunger
and
broughtest
forth
water
for
them
out
the
rock
for
their
thirst
and
commandedst
them
that
they
should
possess
the
land
which
thou
hadst
sworn
give
them
Nehemiah
But
they
and
our
fathers
dealt
proudly
and
hardened
their
neck
and
hearkened
not
thy
commandments
Nehemiah
and
refused
obey
neither
were
mindful
thy
wonders
that
thou
didst
among
them
but
hardened
their
neck
and
their
rebellion
appointed
captain
return
their
bondage
But
thou
art
God
ready
pardon
gracious
and
merciful
slow
anger
and
abundant
lovingkindness
and
forsookest
them
not
Nehemiah
Yea
when
they
had
made
them
molten
calf
and
said
This
thy
God
that
brought
thee
out
Egypt
and
had
wrought
great
provocations
Nehemiah
yet
thou
thy
manifold
mercies
forsookest
them
not
the
wilderness
the
pillar
cloud
departed
not
from
over
them
day
lead
them
the
way
neither
the
pillar
fire
night
show
them
light
and
the
way
wherein
they
should
Nehemiah
Thou
gavest
also
thy
good
Spirit
instruct
them
and
withheldest
not
thy
manna
from
their
mouth
and
gavest
them
water
for
their
thirst
Nehemiah
Yea
forty
years
didst
thou
sustain
them
the
wilderness
and
they
lacked
nothing
their
clothes
waxed
not
old
and
their
feet
swelled
not
Nehemiah
Moreover
thou
gavest
them
kingdoms
and
peoples
which
thou
didst
allot
after
their
portions
they
possessed
the
land
Sihon
even
the
land
the
king
Heshbon
and
the
land
king
Bashan
Nehemiah
Their
children
also
multipliedst
thou
the
stars
heaven
and
broughtest
them
into
the
land
concerning
which
thou
didst
say
their
fathers
that
they
should
possess
Nehemiah
the
children
went
and
possessed
the
land
and
thou
subduedst
before
them
the
inhabitants
the
land
the
Canaanites
and
gavest
them
into
their
hands
with
their
kings
and
the
peoples
the
land
that
they
might
with
them
they
would
Nehemiah
And
they
took
fortified
cities
and
fat
land
and
possessed
houses
full
all
good
things
cisterns
hewn
out
vineyards
and
oliveyards
and
fruit
trees
abundance
they
did
eat
and
were
filled
and
became
fat
and
delighted
themselves
thy
great
goodness
Nehemiah
Nevertheless
they
were
disobedient
and
rebelled
against
thee
and
cast
thy
law
behind
their
back
and
slew
thy
prophets
that
testified
against
them
turn
them
again
unto
thee
and
they
wrought
great
provocations
Nehemiah
Therefore
thou
deliveredst
them
into
the
hand
their
adversaries
who
distressed
them
and
the
time
their
trouble
when
they
cried
unto
thee
thou
heardest
from
heaven
and
according
thy
manifold
mercies
thou
gavest
them
saviours
who
saved
them
out
the
hand
their
adversaries
Nehemiah
But
after
they
had
rest
they
did
evil
again
before
thee
therefore
leftest
thou
them
the
hand
their
enemies
that
they
had
the
dominion
over
them
yet
when
they
returned
and
cried
unto
thee
thou
heardest
from
heaven
and
many
times
didst
thou
deliver
them
according
thy
mercies
Nehemiah
and
testifiedst
against
them
that
thou
mightest
bring
them
again
unto
thy
law
Yet
they
dealt
proudly
and
hearkened
not
unto
thy
commandments
but
sinned
against
thine
ordinances
which
man
shall
live
them
and
withdrew
the
shoulder
and
hardened
their
neck
and
would
not
hear
Nehemiah
Yet
many
years
didst
thou
bear
with
them
and
testifiedst
against
them
thy
Spirit
through
thy
prophets
yet
would
they
not
give
ear
therefore
gavest
thou
them
into
the
hand
the
peoples
the
lands
Nehemiah
Nevertheless
thy
manifold
mercies
thou
didst
not
make
full
end
them
nor
forsake
them
for
thou
art
gracious
and
merciful
God
Nehemiah
Now
therefore
our
God
the
great
the
mighty
and
the
terrible
God
who
keepest
covenant
and
lovingkindness
let
not
all
the
travail
seem
little
before
thee
that
hath
come
upon
our
kings
our
princes
and
our
priests
and
our
prophets
and
our
fathers
and
all
thy
people
since
the
time
the
kings
Assyria
unto
this
day
Nehemiah
Howbeit
thou
art
just
all
that
come
upon
for
thou
hast
dealt
truly
but
have
done
wickedly
Nehemiah
neither
have
our
kings
our
princes
our
priests
nor
our
fathers
kept
thy
law
nor
hearkened
unto
thy
commandments
and
thy
testimonies
wherewith
thou
didst
testify
against
them
Nehemiah
For
they
have
not
served
thee
their
kingdom
and
thy
great
goodness
that
thou
gavest
them
and
the
large
and
fat
land
which
thou
gavest
before
them
neither
turned
they
from
their
wicked
works
Nehemiah
Behold
are
servants
this
day
and
for
the
land
that
thou
gavest
unto
our
fathers
eat
the
fruit
thereof
and
the
good
thereof
behold
are
servants
Nehemiah
And
yieldeth
much
increase
unto
the
kings
whom
thou
hast
set
over
because
our
sins
also
they
have
power
over
our
bodies
and
over
our
cattle
their
pleasure
and
are
great
distress
Nehemiah
And

all
this

required

which
was
for

that
day
they
read
the
book

the
audience
the
people
and
therein
was
found
written
that
Ammonite
and
Moabite
should
not
enter
into
the
assembly
God
for
ever
Nehemiah
because
they
met
not
the
children
Israel
with
bread
and
with
water
but
hired
Balaam
against
them
curse
them
howbeit
our
God
turned
the
curse
into
blessing
Nehemiah
And
came
pass
when
they
had
heard
the
law
that
they
separated
from
Israel
all
the
mixed
multitude
Nehemiah
Now
before
this
Eliashib
the
priest
who
was
appointed
over
the
chambers
the
house
our
God
being
allied
unto
Tobiah
Nehemiah
had
prepared
for
him
great
chamber
where
aforetime
they
laid
the
meal
offerings
the
frankincense
and
the
vessels
and
the
tithes
the
grain
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
which
were
given
commandment
the
Levites
and
the
singers
and
the
porters
and
the
heave
offerings
for
the
priests
Nehemiah
But
all
this
time
was
not
Jerusalem
for
the
two
and
thirtieth
year
Artaxerxes
king
Babylon
went
unto
the
king
and
after
certain
days
asked
leave
the
king
Nehemiah
and
came
Jerusalem
and
understood
the
evil
that
Eliashib
had
done
for
Tobiah
preparing
him
chamber
the
courts
the
house
God
Nehemiah
And
grieved
sore
therefore
cast
forth
all
the
household
stuff
Tobiah
out
the
chamber
Nehemiah
Then
commanded
and
they
cleansed
the
chambers
and
thither
brought
again
the
vessels
the
house
God
with
the
meal
offerings
and
the
frankincense
Nehemiah
And
perceived
that
the
portions
the
Levites
had
not
been
given
them
that
the
Levites
and
the
singers
that
did
the
work
were
fled
every
one
his
field
Nehemiah
Then
contended
with
the
rulers
and
said
Why
the
house
God
forsaken
And
gathered
them
together
and
set
them
their
place
Nehemiah
Then
brought
all
Judah
the
tithe
the
grain
and
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
unto
the
treasuries
Nehemiah
And
made
treasurers
over
the
treasuries
Shelemiah
the
priest
and
Zadok
the
scribe
and
the
Levites
Pedaiah
and
next
them
was
Hanan
the
son
Zaccur
the
son
Mattaniah
for
they
were
counted
faithful
and
their
business
was
distribute
unto
their
brethren
Nehemiah
Remember
God
concerning
this
and
wipe
not
out
good
deeds
that
have
done
for
the
house
God
and
for
the
observances
thereof
Nehemiah
those
days
saw
Judah
some
men
treading
winepresses
the
sabbath
and
bringing
sheaves
and
lading
asses
therewith
also
wine
grapes
and
figs
and
all
manner
burdens
which
they
brought
into
Jerusalem
the
sabbath
day
and
testified
against
them
the
day
wherein
they
sold
victuals
Nehemiah
There
dwelt
men
Tyre
also
therein
who
brought
fish
and
all
manner
wares
and
sold
the
sabbath
unto
the
children
Judah
and
Jerusalem
Nehemiah
Then
contended
with
the
nobles
Judah
and
said
unto
them
What
evil
thing
this
that
and
profane
the
sabbath
day
Nehemiah
Did
not
your
fathers
thus
and
did
not
our
God
bring
all
this
evil
upon
and
upon
this
city
yet
bring
more
wrath
upon
Israel
profaning
the
sabbath
Nehemiah
And
came
pass
that
when
the
gates
Jerusalem
began
dark
before
the
sabbath
commanded
that
the
doors
should
shut
and
commanded
that
they
should
not
opened
till
after
the
sabbath
and
some
servants
set
over
the
gates
that
there
should
burden
brought
the
sabbath
day
Nehemiah
the
merchants
and
sellers
all
kind
wares
lodged
without
Jerusalem
once
twice
Nehemiah
Then
testified
against
them
and
said
unto
them
Why
lodge
about
the
wall
again
will
lay
hands
you
From
that
time
forth
came
they
more
the
sabbath
Nehemiah
And
commanded
the
Levites
that
they
should
purify
themselves
and
that
they
should
come
and
keep
the
gates
sanctify
the
sabbath
day
Remember
unto
God
this
also
and
spare
according
the
greatness
thy
lovingkindness
Nehemiah
those
days
also
saw
the
Jews
that
had
married
women
Ashdod
Ammon
and
Moab
Nehemiah
and
their
children
spake
half
the
speech
Ashdod
and
could
not
speak
the
Jews
language
but
according
the
language
each
people
Nehemiah
And
contended
with
them
and
cursed
them
and
smote
certain
them
and
plucked
off
their
hair
and
made
them
swear
God
saying
shall
not
give
your
daughters
unto
their
sons
nor
take
their
daughters
for
your
sons
for
yourselves
Nehemiah
Did
not
Solomon
king
Israel
sin
these
things
yet
among
many
nations
was
there
king
like
him
and
was
beloved
his
God
and
God
made
him
king
over
all
Israel
nevertheless
even
him
did
foreign
women
cause
sin
Nehemiah
Shall
then
hearken
unto
you
all
this
great
evil
trespass
against
our
God
marrying
foreign
women

And

Wherefore
they
called

matter
and
that
which

and

Job
There
was
man
the
land
whose
name
was
Job
and
that
man
was
perfect
and
upright
and
one
that
feared
God
and
turned
away
from
evil
Job
And
there
were
born
unto
him
seven
sons
and
three
daughters
Job
His
substance
also
was
seven
thousand
sheep
and
three
thousand
camels
and
five
hundred
yoke
oxen
and
five
hundred
she
asses
and
very
great
household
that
this
man
was
the
greatest
all
the
children
the
east
Job
And
his
sons
went
and
held
feast
the
house
each
one
upon
his
day
and
they
Sent
and
called
for
their
three
sisters
eat
and
drink
with
them
Job
And
was
when
the
days
their
feasting
were
gone
about
that
Job
sent
and
sanctified
them
and
rose
early
the
morning
and
offered
burnt
offerings
according
the
number
them
all
for
Job
said
may
that
sons
have
sinned
and
renounced
God
their
hearts
Thus
did
Job
continually
Job
Now
came
pass
the
day
when
the
sons
God
came
present
themselves
before
Jehovah
that
Satan
also
came
among
them
Job
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Satan
Whence
comest
thou
Then
Satan
answered
Jehovah
and
said
From
going
and
fro
the
earth
and
from
walking
and
down
Job
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Satan
Hast
thou
considered
servant
Job
for
there
none
like
him
the
earth
perfect
and
upright
man
one
that
feareth
God
and
turneth
away
from
evil
Job
Then
Satan
answered
Jehovah
and
said
Doth
Job
fear
God
for
nought
Job
Hast
not
thou
made
hedge
about
him
and
about
his
house
and
about
all
that
hath
every
side
thou
hast
blessed
the
work
his
hands
and
his
substance
increased
the
land
Job
But
put
forth
thy
hand
now
and
touch
all
that
hath
and
will
renounce
thee
thy
face
Job
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Satan
Behold
all
that
hath
thy
power
only
upon
himself
put
not
forth
thy
hand
Satan
went
forth
from
the
presence
Jehovah
Job
And
fell
day
when
his
sons
and
his
daughters
were
eating
and
drinking
wine
their
eldest
brother
house
Job
that
there
came
messenger
unto
Job
and
said
The
oxen
were
plowing
and
the
asses
feeding
beside
them
Job
and
the
Sabeans
fell
upon
them
and
took
them
away
yea
they
have
slain
the
servants
with
the
edge
the
sword
and
only
escaped
alone
tell
thee
Job
While
was
yet
speaking
there
came
also
another
and
said
The
fire
God
fallen
from
heaven
and
hath
burned
the
sheep
and
the
servants
and
consumed
them
and
only
escaped
alone
tell
thee
Job
While
was
yet
speaking
there
came
also
another
and
said
The
Chaldeans
made
three
bands
and
fell
upon
the
camels
and
have
taken
them
away
yea
and
slain
the
servants
with
the
edge
the
sword
and
only
escaped
alone
tell
thee
Job
While
was
yet
speaking
there
came
also
another
and
said
Thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
were
eating
and
drinking
wine
their
eldest
brother
house
Job
and
behold
there
came
great
wind
from
the
wilderness
and
smote
the
four
corners
the
house
and
fell
upon
the
young
men
and
they
are
dead
and
only
escaped
alone
tell
thee
Job
Then
Job
arose
and
rent
his
robe
and
shaved
his
head
and
fell
down
upon
the
ground
and
worshipped
Job
and
said
Naked
came
out
mother
womb
and
naked
shall
return
thither
Jehovah
gave
and
Jehovah
hath
taken
away
blessed
the
name
Jehovah
Job
all
this
Job
sinned
not
nor
charged
God
foolishly
Job
Again
came
pass
the
day
when
the
sons
God
came
present
themselves
before
Jehovah
that
Satan
came
also
among
them
present
himself
before
Jehovah
Job
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Satan
From
whence
comest
thou
And
Satan
answered
Jehovah
and
said
From
going
and
fro
the
earth
and
from
walking
and
down
Job
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Satan
Hast
thou
considered
servant
Job
for
there
none
like
him
the
earth
perfect
and
upright
man
one
that
feareth
God
and
turneth
away
from
evil
and
still
holdeth
fast
his
integrity
although
thou
movedst
against
him
destroy
him
without
cause
Job
And
Satan
answered
Jehovah
and
said
Skin
for
skin
yea
all
that
man
hath
will
give
for
his
life
Job
But
put
forth
thy
hand
now
and
touch
his
bone
and
his
flesh
and
will
renounce
thee
thy
face
Job
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Satan
Behold
thy
hand
only
spare
his
life
Job
Satan
went
forth
from
the
presence
Jehovah
and
smote
Job
with
sore
boils
from
the
sole
his
foot
unto
his
crown
Job
And
took
him
potsherd
scrape
himself
therewith
and
sat
among
the
ashes
Job
Then
said
his
wife
unto
him
Dost
thou
still
hold
fast
thine
integrity
renounce
God
and
die
Job
But
said
unto
her
Thou
speakest
one
the
foolish
women
speaketh
What
shall
receive
good
the
hand
God
and
shall
not
receive
evil
all
this
did
not
Job
sin
with
his
lips
Job
Now
when
Job
three
friends
heard
all
this
evil
that
was
come
upon
him
they
came
every
one
from
his
own
place
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
and
Bildad
the
Shuhite
and
Zophar
the
Naamathite
and
they
made
appointment
together
come
bemoan
him
and
comfort
him
Job
And
when
they
lifted
their
eyes
afar
off
and
knew
him
not
they
lifted
their
voice
and
wept
and
they
rent
every
one
his
robe
and
sprinkled
dust
upon
their
heads
toward
heaven
Job
they
sat
down
with
him
upon
the
ground
seven
days
and
seven
nights
and
none
spake
word
unto
him
for
they
saw
that
his
grief
was
very
great
Job
After
this
opened
Job
his
mouth
and
cursed
his
day
Job
And
Job
answered
and
said
Job
Let
the
day
perish
wherein
was
born
And
the
night
which
said
There
man
child
conceived
Job
Let
that
day
darkness
Let
not
God
from
above
seek
for
Neither
let
the
light
shine
upon
Job
Let
darkness
and
the
shadow
death
claim
for
their
own
Let
cloud
dwell
upon
Let
all
that
maketh
black
the
day
terrify
Job
for
that
night
let
thick
darkness
seize
upon
Let
not
rejoice
among
the
days
the
year
Let
not
come
into
the
number
the
months
Job
let
that
night
barren
Let
joyful
voice
come
therein
Job
Let
them
curse
that
curse
the
day
Who
are
ready
rouse
leviathan
Job
Let
the
stars
the
twilight
thereof
dark
Let
look
for
light
but
have
none
Neither
let
behold
the
eyelids
the
morning
Job
Because
shut
not
the
doors
mother
womb
Nor
hid
trouble
from
mine
eyes
Job
Why
died
not
from
the
womb
Why
did
not
give
the
ghost
when
mother
bare
Job
Why
did
the
knees
receive
why
the
breast
that
should
suck
Job
For
now
should
have
lain
down
and
been
quiet
should
have
slept
then
had
been
rest
Job
With
kings
and
counsellors
the
earth
Who
built
waste
places
for
themselves
Job
with
princes
that
had
gold
Who
filled
their
houses
with
silver
Job
hidden
untimely
birth
had
not
been
infants
that
never
saw
light
Job
There
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
And
there
the
weary
are
rest
Job
There
the
prisoners
are
ease
together
They
hear
not
the
voice
the
taskmaster
Job
The
small
and
the
great
are
there
And
the
servant
free
from
his
master
Job
Wherefore
light
given
him
that
misery
And
life
unto
the
bitter
soul
Job
Who
long
for
death
but
cometh
not
And
dig
for
more
than
for
hid
treasures
Job
Who
rejoice
exceedingly
And
are
glad
when
they
can
find
the
grave
Job
Why
light
given
man
whose
way
hid
And
whom
God
hath
hedged
Job
For
sighing
cometh
before
eat
And
groanings
are
poured
out
like
water
Job
For
the
thing
which
fear
cometh
upon
And
that
which
afraid
cometh
unto
Job
not
ease
neither
quiet
neither
have
rest
But
trouble
cometh
Job
Then
answered
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
and
said
Job
one
assay
commune
with
thee
wilt
thou
grieved
But
who
can
withhold
himself
from
speaking
Job
Behold
thou
hast
instructed
many
And
thou
hast
strengthened
the
weak
hands
Job
Thy
words
have
upholden
him
that
was
falling
And
thou
hast
made
firm
the
feeble
knees
Job
But
now
come
unto
thee
and
thou
faintest
toucheth
thee
and
thou
art
troubled
Job
not
thy
fear
God
thy
confidence
And
the
integrity
thy
ways
thy
hope
Job
Remember
pray
thee
who
ever
perished
being
innocent
where
were
the
upright
cut
off
Job
According
have
seen
they
that
plow
iniquity
And
sow
trouble
reap
the
same
Job
the
breath
God
they
perish
And
the
blast
his
anger
are
they
consumed
Job
The
roaring
the
lion
and
the
voice
the
fierce
lion
And
the
teeth
the
young
lions
are
broken
Job
The
old
lion
perisheth
for
lack
prey
And
the
whelps
the
lioness
are
scattered
abroad
Job
Now
thing
was
secretly
brought
And
mine
ear
received
whisper
thereof
Job
thoughts
from
the
visions
the
night
When
deep
sleep
falleth
men
Job
Fear
came
upon
and
trembling
Which
made
all
bones
shake
Job
Then
spirit
passed
before
face
The
hair
flesh
stood
Job
stood
still
but
could
not
discern
the
appearance
thereof
form
was
before
mine
eyes
There
was
silence
and
heard
voice
saying
Job
Shall
mortal
man
more
just
than
God
Shall
man
more
pure
than
his
Maker
Job
Behold
putteth
trust
his
servants
And
his
angels
chargeth
with
folly
Job
How
much
more
them
that
dwell
houses
clay
Whose
foundation
the
dust
Who
are
crushed
before
the
moth
Job
Betwixt
morning
and
evening
they
are
destroyed
They
perish
for
ever
without
any
regarding
Job
not
their
tent
cord
plucked
within
them
They
die
and
that
without
wisdom
Job
Call
now
there
any
that
will
answer
thee
And
which
the
holy
ones
wilt
thou
turn
Job
For
vexation
killeth
the
foolish
man
And
jealousy
slayeth
the
silly
one
Job
have
seen
the
foolish
taking
root
But
suddenly
cursed
his
habitation
Job
His
children
are
far
from
safety
And
they
are
crushed
the
gate
Neither
there
any
deliver
them
Job
Whose
harvest
the
hungry
eateth
And
taketh
even
out
the
thorns
And
the
snare
gapeth
for
their
substance
Job
For
affliction
cometh
not
forth
from
the
dust
Neither
doth
trouble
spring
out
the
ground
Job
But
man
born
unto
trouble
the
sparks
fly
upward
Job
But
for
would
seek
unto
God
And
unto
God
would
commit
cause
Job
Who
doeth
great
things
and
unsearchable
Marvellous
things
without
number
Job
Who
giveth
rain
upon
the
earth
And
sendeth
waters
upon
the
fields
Job
that
setteth
high
those
that
are
low
And
those
that
mourn
are
exalted
safety
Job
frustrateth
the
devices
the
crafty
that
their
hands
cannot
perform
their
enterprise
Job
taketh
the
wise
their
own
craftiness
And
the
counsel
the
cunning
carried
headlong
Job
They
meet
with
darkness
the
day
time
And
grope
noonday
the
night
Job
But
saveth
from
the
sword
their
mouth
Even
the
needy
from
the
hand
the
mighty
Job
the
poor
hath
hope
And
iniquity
stoppeth
her
mouth
Job
Behold
happy
the
man
whom
God
correcteth
Therefore
despise
not
thou
the
chastening
the
Almighty
Job
For
maketh
sore
and
bindeth
woundeth
and
his
hands
make
whole
Job
will
deliver
thee
six
troubles
Yea
seven
there
shall
evil
touch
thee
Job
famine
will
redeem
thee
from
death
And
war
from
the
power
the
sword
Job
Thou
shalt
hid
from
the
scourge
the
tongue
Neither
shalt
thou
afraid
destruction
when
cometh
Job
destruction
and
dearth
thou
shalt
laugh
Neither
shalt
thou
afraid
the
beasts
the
earth
Job
For
thou
shalt
league
with
the
stones
the
field
And
the
beasts
the
field
shall
peace
with
thee
Job
And
thou
shalt
know
that
thy
tent
peace
And
thou
shalt
visit
thy
fold
and
shalt
miss
nothing
Job
Thou
shalt
know
also
that
thy
seed
shall
great
And
thine
offspring
the
grass
the
earth
Job
Thou
shalt
come
thy
grave
full
age
Like
shock
grain
cometh
its
season
Job
this
have
searched
Hear
and
know
thou
for
thy
good
Job
Then
Job
answered
and
said
Job
that
vexation
were
but
weighed
And
all
calamity
laid
the
balances
Job
For
now
would
heavier
than
the
sand
the
seas
Therefore
have
words
been
rash
Job
For
the
arrows
the
Almighty
are
within
The
poison
whereof
spirit
drinketh
The
terrors
God
set
themselves
array
against
Job
Doth
the
wild
ass
bray
when
hath
grass
loweth
the
over
his
fodder
Job
Can
that
which
hath
savor
eaten
without
salt
there
any
taste
the
white
egg
Job
soul
refuseth
touch
them
They
are
loathsome
food
Job
that
might
have
request
And
that
God
would
grant
the
thing
that
long
for
Job
Even
that
would
please
God
crush
That
would
let
loose
his
hand
and
cut
off
Job
And
still
consolation
Yea
let
exult
pain
that
spareth
not
That
have
not
denied
the
words
the
Holy
One
Job
What
strength
that
should
wait
And
what
mine
end
that
should
patient
Job
strength
the
strength
stones
flesh
brass
Job
not
that
have
help
And
that
wisdom
driven
quite
from
Job
him
that
ready
faint
kindness
should
showed
from
his
friend
Even
him
that
forsaketh
the
fear
the
Almighty
Job
brethren
have
dealt
deceitfully
brook
the
channel
brooks
that
pass
away
Job
Which
are
black
reason
the
ice
And
wherein
the
snow
hideth
itself
Job
What
time
they
wax
warm
they
vanish
When
hot
they
are
consumed
out
their
place
Job
The
caravans
that
travel
the
way
them
turn
aside
They
into
the
waste
and
perish
Job
The
caravans
Tema
looked
The
companies
Sheba
waited
for
them
Job
They
were
put
shame
because
they
had
hoped
They
came
thither
and
were
confounded
Job
For
now
are
nothing
see
terror
and
are
afraid
Job
Did
say
Give

Offer
present
for
your
substance
Job
Deliver
from
the
adversary
hand
Redeem
from
the
hand
the
oppressors
Job
Teach
and
will
hold
peace
And
cause
understand
wherein
have
erred
Job
How
forcible
are
words
uprightness
But
your
reproof
what
doth
reprove
Job
think
reprove
words
Seeing
that
the
speeches
one
that
desperate
are
wind
Job
Yea
would
cast
lots
upon
the
fatherless
And
make
merchandise
your
friend
Job
Now
therefore
pleased
look
upon
For
surely
shall
not
lie
your
face
Job
Return
pray
you
let
there
injustice
Yea
return
again
cause

Job
there
injustice
tongue
Cannot
taste
discern
mischievous
things
Job
there
not
warfare
man
upon
earth
And
are
not
his
days
like
the
days
hireling
Job
servant
that
earnestly
desireth
the
shadow
And
hireling
that
looketh
for
his
wages
Job
made
possess
months
misery
And
wearisome
nights
are
appointed
Job
When
lie
down

When
shall
arise
and
the
night
gone
And
full
tossings
and
fro
unto
the
dawning
the
day
Job
flesh
clothed
with
worms
and
clods
dust
skin
closeth
and
breaketh
out

Job
days
are
swifter
than
weaver
shuttle
And
are
spent
without
hope
Job
remember
that
life
breath
Mine
eye
shall
more
see
good
Job
The
eye
him
that
seeth
shall
behold

Thine
eyes
shall

but

not
Job
the
cloud
consumed
and
vanisheth
away
that

down
Sheol
shall
come

Job
shall
return

his
house
Neither
shall
his

know
him
any
more
Job
Therefore
will
not
refrain
mouth
will
speak
the
anguish
spirit
will
complain
the
bitterness
soul
Job
sea
sea
monster
That
thou
settest
watch
over
Job
When
say
bed
shall
comfort
couch
shall
ease
complaint
Job
Then
thou
scarest
with
dreams
And
terrifiest
through
visions
Job
that
soul
chooseth
strangling
And
death
rather
than
these
bones
Job
loathe
life
would
not
live
alway
Let
alone
for
days
are
vanity
Job
What
man
that
thou
shouldest
magnify
him
And
that
thou
shouldest
set
thy
mind
upon
him
Job
And
that
thou
shouldest
visit
him
every
morning
And
try
him
every
moment
Job
How
long
wilt
thou
not
look
away
from
Nor
let
alone
till
swallow
down
spittle
Job
have
sinned
what
unto
thee
thou
watcher
men
Why
hast
thou
set
mark
for
thee
that
burden
myself
Job
And
why
dost
thou
not
pardon
transgression
and
take
away
mine
iniquity
For
now
shall
lie
down
the
dust
And
thou
wilt
seek
diligently
but
shall
not
Job
Then
answered
Bildad
the
Shuhite
and
said
Job
How
long
wilt
thou
speak
these
things
And
how
long
shall
the
words
thy
mouth
like
mighty
wind
Job
Doth
God
pervert
justice
doth
the
Almighty
pervert
righteousness
Job
thy
children
have
sinned
against
him
And
hath
delivered
them
into
the
hand
their
transgression
Job
thou
wouldest
seek
diligently
unto
God
And
make
thy
supplication
the
Almighty
Job
thou
wert
pure
and
upright
Surely
now
would
awake
for
thee
And
make
the
habitation
thy
righteousness
prosperous
Job
And
though
thy
beginning
was
small
Yet
thy
latter
end
would
greatly
increase
Job
For
inquire
pray
thee
the
former
age
And
apply
thyself
that
which
their
fathers
have
searched
out
Job
For
are
but
yesterday
and
know
nothing
Because
our
days
upon
earth
are
shadow
Job
Shall
not
they
teach
thee
and
tell
thee
And
utter
words
out
their
heart
Job
Can
the
rush
grow
without
mire
Can
the
flag
grow
without
water
Job
Whilst
yet
its
greenness
and
not
cut
down
withereth
before
any
other
herb
Job
are
the
paths
all
that
forget
God
And
the
hope
the
godless
man
shall
perish
Job
Whose
confidence
shall
break
sunder
And
whose
trust
spider
web
Job
shall
lean
upon
his
house
but
shall
not
stand
shall
hold
fast
thereby
but
shall
not
endure
Job
green
before
the
sun
And
his
shoots
forth
over
his
garden
Job
His
roots
are
wrapped
about
the
stone
heap
beholdeth
the
place
stones
Job
destroyed
from
his
place
Then
shall
deny
him
saying
have
not
seen
thee
Job
Behold
this
the
joy
his
way
And
out
the
earth

Job
Behold
God
will
not
cast
away
perfect
man
Neither
will
uphold
the
evil
doers
Job
will
yet
fill
thy
mouth
with
laughter
And
thy
lips
with
shouting
Job
They
that
hate
thee
shall
clothed
with
shame
And
the
tent
the
wicked
shall
more
Job
Then
Job
answered
and
said
Job
truth
know
that
But
how
can
man
just
with
God
Job
pleased
contend
with
him
cannot
answer
him
one
thousand
Job
wise
heart
and
mighty
strength
Who
hath
hardened
himself
against
him
and
prospered
Job
Him
that
removeth
the
mountains
and
they
know
not
When
overturneth
them
his
anger
Job
That
shaketh
the
earth
out
its
place
And
the
pillars
thereof
tremble
Job
That
commandeth
the
sun
and
riseth
not
And
sealeth
the
stars
Job
That
alone
stretcheth
out
the
heavens
And
treadeth
upon
the
waves
the
sea
Job
That
maketh
the
Bear
Orion
and
the
Pleiades
And
the
chambers
the
south
Job
That
doeth
great
things
past
finding
out
Yea
marvellous
things
without
number
Job
goeth
and
see
him
not
passeth
also
but
perceive
him
not
Job
Behold
seizeth
the
prey
who
can
hinder
him
Who
will
say
unto
him
What
doest
thou
Job
God
will
not
withdraw
his
anger
The
helpers
Rahab
stoop
under
him
Job
How
much
less
shall
answer
him
And
choose
out
words
reason
with
him
Job
Whom
though
were
righteous
yet
would
not
answer
would
make
supplication
judge
Job
had
called
and
had
answered
Yet
would
not
believe
that
hearkened
unto
voice
Job
For
breaketh
with
tempest
And
multiplieth
wounds
without
cause
Job
will
not
suffer
take
breath
But
filleth
with
bitterness
Job
speak
strength
mighty
And
justice
Who
saith

summon
Job
Though
righteous
mine

mouth
shall
condemn
Though
perfect
shall
prove
perverse
Job
perfect

not
myself
despise
life
Job
all
one
therefore
say
destroyeth
the
perfect
and
the
wicked
Job
the
scourge
slay
suddenly
will
mock
the
trial
the
innocent
Job
The
earth
given
into
the
hand
the
wicked
covereth
the
faces
the
judges
thereof
not
who
then
Job
Now
days
are
swifter
than
post
They
flee
away
they
see
good
Job
They
are
passed
away
the
swift
ships
the
eagle
that
swoopeth
the

Job
say
will
forget
complaint
will
put
off
sad
countenance
and
good
cheer
Job
afraid
all

know
that
thou

Job

Why
then
labor
vain
Job
wash
myself
with
snow
water
And
make
hands
never
clean
Job
Yet
wilt
thou
plunge
the
ditch
And
mine

shall
abhor
Job
For
not

that
should

him
That

judgment
Job
There
umpire

That

lay
his
hand
upon

Job
Let
him
take
his
rod
away
from
And
let
not
his

Job
Then
would
speak
and
not
fear
him
For

Job
soul
weary
life
will
give

complaint
will
speak
the

soul
Job
will
say
unto
God
not

Show
wherefore
thou
contendest
with
Job
good
unto
thee
that
thou
shouldest
oppress
That
thou
shouldest
despise
the
work
thy
hands
And
shine
upon
the
counsel
the
wicked
Job
Hast
thou
eyes
flesh
seest
thou
man
seeth
Job
Are
thy
days
the
days
man
thy
years
man
days
Job
That
thou
inquirest
after
mine
iniquity
And
searchest
after
sin
Job
Although
thou
knowest
that
not
wicked
And
there
none
that
can
deliver
out
thy
hand
Job
Thy
hands
have
framed
and
fashioned
Together
round
about
yet
thou
dost
destroy
Job
Remember
beseech
thee
that
thou
hast
fashioned
clay
And
wilt
thou
bring
into
dust
again
Job
Hast
thou
not
poured
out
milk
And
curdled
like
cheese
Job
Thou
hast
clothed
with
skin
and
flesh
And
knit
together
with
bones
and
sinews
Job
Thou
hast
granted
life
and
lovingkindness
And
thy
visitation
hath
preserved
spirit
Job
Yet
these
things
thou
didst
hide
thy
heart
know
that
this
with
thee
Job
sin
then
thou
markest
And
thou
wilt
not
acquit
from
mine
iniquity
Job
wicked
woe
unto
And
righteous
yet
shall
not
lift
head
Being
filled
with
ignominy
And
looking
upon
mine
affliction
Job
And
head
exalt
itself
thou
huntest
lion
And
again
thou
showest
thyself
marvellous
upon
Job
Thou
renewest
thy
witnesses
against
And
increasest
thine
indignation
upon
Changes
and
warfare
are
with
Job
Wherefore
then
hast
thou
brought
forth
out
the
womb
had
given
the
ghost
and
eye
had
seen
Job
should
have
been
though
had
not
been
should
have
been
carried
from
the
womb
the
grave
Job
Are
not
days
few
cease
then
And
let
alone
that
may
take
comfort
little
Job
Before
whence
shall
not
return
Even
the
land
darkness
and
the
shadow
death
Job
The
land
dark
midnight
The
land
the
shadow
death
without
any
order
And
where
the
light
midnight
Job
Then
answered
Zophar
the
Naamathite
and
said
Job
Should
not
the
multitude
words
answered
And
should
man
full
talk
justified
Job
Should
thy
boastings
make
men
hold
their
peace
And
when
thou
mockest
shall
man
make
thee
ashamed
Job
For
thou
sayest
doctrine
pure
And
clean
thine
eyes
Job
But
that
God
would
speak
And
open
his
lips
against
thee
Job
And
that
would
show
thee
the
secrets
wisdom
For
manifold
understanding
Know
therefore
that
God
exacteth
thee
less
than
thine
iniquity
deserveth
Job
Canst
thou
searching
find
out
God
Canst
thou
find
out
the
Almighty
unto
perfection
Job
high
heaven
what
canst
thou
Deeper
than
Sheol
what
canst
thou
know
Job
The
measure
thereof
longer
than
the
earth
And
broader
than
the

Job
pass
through
and
shut
And
call
unto
judgment
then
who
can
hinder
him
Job
For
knoweth
false
men
seeth
iniquity
also
even
though

not
Job
But
vain
man
void
understanding
Yea
man
born
wild
ass
colt
Job
thou
set
thy
heart
aright
And
stretch
out
thy
hands
toward
him
Job
iniquity
thy
hand
put
far
away
And
let
not
unrighteousness
dwell
thy
tents
Job
Surely
then
shalt
thou
lift
thy
face
without
spot
Yea
thou
shalt
stedfast
and
shalt
not
fear
Job
For
thou
shalt
forget
thy
misery
Thou
shalt
remember
waters
that
are
passed
away
Job
And
thy
life
shall
clearer
than
the
noonday
Though
there
darkness
shall
the
morning
Job
And
thou
shalt
secure
because
there
hope
Yea
thou
shalt
search
about
thee
and
shalt
take
thy
rest
safety
Job
Also
thou
shalt
lie
down
and
none
shall
make
thee
afraid
Yea
many
shall
make
suit
unto
thee
Job
But
the
eyes
the
wicked
shall
fail
And
they
shall
have
way
flee
And
their
hope
shall
the
giving

ghost
Job
Then
Job
answered
and
said
Job
doubt
but
are
the
people
And
wisdom
shall
die
with
you
Job
But
have
understanding
well
you
not
inferior

Yea
who
knoweth
not
such

these
Job
one
that

The

Job
the

Job
The

And
they
that
provoke
God
are
secure
Into
whose

God
bringeth
abundantly
Job
But
ask
now
the
beasts
and
they
shall
teach
thee
And
the
birds
the
heavens
and
they
shall
tell
thee
Job
speak
the

thee
And
the

Job
Who

That

Jehovah

Job
whose

And

Job
Doth

Even

Job
With

And

With

Behold

Again

Job
With

The

They

Surely

But

Hear

Job
Your

For

Only

Job
Withdraw

Job
Then

Job
How

Make

Job
Wherefore
hidest
thou
thy

And
holdest
for
thine
enemy
Job
Wilt
thou
harass
driven
leaf
And
wilt
thou
pursue
the
dry

Job
For
thou
writest
bitter

And

Job
Thou

And
markest

Thou

Job
Though
like

Like

eaten
Job
Man
that

and
full

Job
cometh
forth
like
flower
and
cut

fleeth

Job
And
dost
thou
open
thine
eyes
upon
such
one
And
bringest
into
judgment
with
thee
Job
Who
can
bring
clean
thing
out
unclean
not
one
Job
Seeing
his
days
are
determined
The
number
his
months
with
thee
And
thou
hast
appointed
his
bounds
that
cannot
pass
Job
Look
away
from
him
that
may
rest
Till
shall
accomplish
hireling
his

Job
For
there
hope
tree
cut
down
that

And
that
the

branch
thereof

Job
Though
the
root
thereof
wax
old
the
earth
And
the
stock
thereof
die
the
ground
Job
Yet
through
the
scent
water
will
bud
And
put
forth
boughs
like
plant
Job
But
man
dieth
and
laid
low
Yea
man
giveth
the
ghost
and
where
Job
the
waters
fail
from
the
sea
And
the
river
wasteth
and
drieth
Job
man
lieth
down
and
riseth
not
Till
the

more
they
shall
not
awake
Nor
roused
out
their

Job
that
thou
wouldest
hide
Sheol
That
thou
wouldest
keep
secret
until
thy
wrath
past
That
thou
wouldest
appoint
set
time
and
remember
Job
man
die
shall
live
again
All
the
days
warfare
would
wait
Till
release
should
come
Job
Thou
wouldest
call
and
would
answer
thee
Thou
wouldest
have
desire
the
work
thy
hands
Job
But
now
thou
numberest
steps
Dost
thou
not
watch
over
sin
Job
transgression
sealed
bag
And
thou
fastenest
mine
iniquity
Job
But
the
mountain
falling
cometh
nought
And
the
rock
removed
out
its
place
Job
The
waters
wear
the
stones
The
overflowings
thereof
wash
away
the
dust
the
earth
thou
destroyest
the
hope
man
Job
Thou
prevailest
for
ever
against
him
and
passeth
Thou
changest
his
countenance
and
sendest
him
away
Job
His
sons
come
honor
and
knoweth
not
And
they
are
brought
low
but
perceiveth
not
them
Job
But
his
flesh
upon
him
hath
pain
And
his
soul
within
him
mourneth
Job
Then
answered
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
and
said
Job
Should
wise
man
make
answer
with
vain
knowledge
And
fill
himself
with
the
east
wind
Job
Should
reason
with
unprofitable
talk
with
speeches
wherewith
can
good
Job
Yea
thou
doest
away
with
fear
And
hinderest
devotion
before
God
Job
For
thine
iniquity
teacheth
thy
mouth
And
thou
choosest
the
tongue
the
crafty
Job
Thine
own
mouth
condemneth
thee
and
not
Yea
thine
own
lips
testify
against
thee
Job
Art
thou
the
first
man
that
was
born
wast
thou
brought
forth
before
the
hills
Job
Hast
thou
heard
the
secret
counsel
God
And
dost
thou
limit
wisdom
thyself
Job
What
knowest
thou
that
know
not
What
understandest
thou
which
not
Job
With
are
both
the
grayheaded
and
the
very
aged
men
Much
elder
than
thy
father
Job
Are
the
consolations
God
too
small
for
thee
Even
the
word
that
gentle
toward
thee
Job
Why
doth
thy
heart
carry
thee
away
And
why
thine
eyes
flash
Job
That
against
God
thou
turnest
thy
spirit
And
lettest
words
out
thy
mouth
Job
What
man
that
should
clean
And
that
born
woman
that
should
righteous
Job
Behold
putteth
trust
his
holy
ones
Yea
the
heavens
are
not
clean
his
sight
Job
How
much
less
one
that
abominable
and
corrupt
man
that
drinketh
iniquity
like
water
Job
will
show
thee
hear
thou
And
that
which
have
seen
will
declare
Job
Which
wise
men
have
told
From
their
fathers
and
have
not
hid
Job
Unto
whom
alone
the
land
was
given
And
stranger
passed
among
them
Job
The
wicked
man
travaileth
with
pain
all
his
days
Even
the
number
years
that
are
laid
for
the
oppressor
Job
sound
terrors
his
ears
prosperity
the
destroyer
shall
come
upon
him
Job
believeth
not
that
shall
return
out
darkness
And
waited
for
the
sword
Job
wandereth
abroad
for
bread
saying
Where
knoweth
that
the
day
darkness
ready
his
hand
Job
Distress
and
anguish
make
him
afraid
They
prevail
against
him
king
ready
the
battle
Job
Because
hath
stretched
out
his
hand
against
God
And
behaveth
himself
proudly
against
the
Almighty
Job
runneth
upon
him
with
stiff
neck
With
the
thick
bosses
his
bucklers
Job
Because
hath
covered
his
face
with
his
fatness
And
gathered
fat
upon
his
loins
Job
And
hath
dwelt
desolate
cities
houses
which
man
inhabited
Which
were
ready
become
heaps
Job
shall
not
rich
neither
shall
his
substance
continue
Neither
shall
their
possessions
extended
the
earth
Job
shall
not
depart
out
darkness
The
flame
shall
dry
his
branches
And
the
breath
God
mouth
shall
away
Job
Let
him
not
trust
vanity
deceiving
himself
For
vanity
shall
his
recompense
Job
shall
accomplished
before
his
time
And
his
branch
shall
not
green
Job
shall
shake
off
his
unripe
grape
the
vine
And
shall
cast
off
his
flower
the
olive
tree
Job
For
the
company
the
godless
shall
barren
And
fire
shall
consume
the
tents
bribery
Job
They
conceive
mischief
and
bring
forth
iniquity
And
their
heart
prepareth
deceit
Job
Then
Job
answered
and
said
Job
have
heard
many
such
things
Miserable
comforters
are
all
Job
Shall
vain
words
have
end
what
provoketh
thee
that
thou
answerest
Job
also
could
speak
your
soul
were
soul
stead
could
join
words
together
against
you
And
shake
head
you
Job
But
would
strengthen
you
with
mouth
And
the
solace
lips
would
assuage
your
grief
Job
Though
speak
grief
not
assuaged
And
though
forbear
what
eased
Job
But
now
hath
made
weary
Thou
hast
made
desolate
all
company
Job
And
thou
hast
laid
fast
hold
which
witness
against
And
leanness
riseth
against
testifieth
face
Job
hath
torn
his
wrath
and
persecuted
hath
gnashed
upon
with
his
teeth
Mine
adversary
sharpeneth
his
eyes
upon
Job
They
have
gaped
upon
with
their
mouth
They
have
smitten
upon
the
cheek
reproachfully
They
gather
themselves
together
against
Job
God
delivereth
the
ungodly
And
casteth
into
the
hands
the
wicked
Job
was
ease
and
brake
asunder
Yea
hath
taken
the
neck
and
dashed
pieces
hath
also
set
for
his
mark
Job
His
archers
compass
round
about
cleaveth
reins
asunder
and
doth
not
spare
poureth
out
gall
upon
the
ground
Job
breaketh
with
breach
upon
breach
runneth
upon
like
giant
Job
have
sewed
sackcloth
upon
skin
And
have
laid
horn
the
dust
Job
face
red
with
weeping
And
eyelids
the
shadow
death
Job
Although
there
violence
hands
And
prayer
pure
Job
earth
cover
not
thou
blood
And
let
cry
have
resting
place
Job
Even
now
behold
witness
heaven
And
that
voucheth
for
high
Job
friends
scoff
But
mine
eye
poureth
out
tears
unto
God
Job
That
would
maintain
the
right
man
with
God
And
son
man
with
his
neighbor
Job
For
when
few
years
are
come
shall
the
way
whence
shall
not
return
Job
spirit
consumed
days
are
extinct
The
grave
ready
for
Job
Surely
there
are
mockers
with
And
mine
eye
dwelleth
upon
their
provocation
Job
Give
now
pledge
surety
for
with
thyself
Who
there
that
will
strike
hands
with
Job
For
thou
hast
hid
their
heart
from
understanding
Therefore
shalt
thou
not
exalt
them
Job
that
denounceth
his
friends
for
prey
Even
the
eyes
his
children
shall
fail
Job
But
hath
made
byword
the
people
And
they
spit
face
Job
Mine
eye
also
dim
reason
sorrow
And
all
members
are
shadow
Job
Upright
men
shall
astonished
this
And
the
innocent
shall
stir
himself
against
the
godless
Job
Yet
shall
the
righteous
hold
his
way
And
that
hath
clean
hands
shall
wax
stronger
and
stronger
Job
But
for
you
all
come
now
again
And
shall
not
find
wise
man
among
you
Job
days
are
past
purposes
are
broken
off
Even
the
thoughts
heart
Job
They
change
the
night
into
day
The
light
say
they
near
unto
the
darkness
Job
look
for
Sheol
house
have
spread
couch
the
darkness
Job
have
said
corruption
Thou
art
father
the
worm
Thou
art
mother
and
sister
Job
Where
then
hope
And
for
hope
who
shall
see
Job
shall
down
the
bars
Sheol
When
once
there
rest
the
dust
Job
Then
answered
Bildad
the
Shuhite
and
said
Job
How
long
will
hunt
for
words
Consider
and
afterwards
will
speak
Job
Wherefore
are
counted
beasts
And
are
become
unclean
your
sight
Job
Thou
that
tearest
thyself
thine
anger
Shall
the
earth
forsaken
for
thee
shall
the
rock
removed
out
its
place
Job
Yea
the
light
the
wicked
shall
put
out
And
the
spark
his
fire
shall
not
shine
Job
The
light
shall
dark
his
tent
And
his
lamp
above
him
shall
put
out
Job
The
steps
his
strength
shall
straitened
And
his
own
counsel
shall
cast
him
down
Job
For
cast
into
net
his
own
feet
And
walketh
upon
the
toils
Job
gin
shall
take
him
the
heel
And
snare
shall
lay
hold
him
Job
noose
hid
for
him
the
ground
And
trap
for
him
the
way
Job
Terrors
shall
make
him
afraid
every
side
And
shall
chase
him
his
heels
Job
His
strength
shall
hunger
bitten
And
calamity
shall
ready
his
side
Job
The
members
his
body
shall
devoured
Yea
the
first
born
death
shall
devour
his
members
Job
shall
rooted
out
his
tent
where
trusteth
And
shall
brought
the
king
terrors
Job
There
shall
dwell
his
tent
that
which
none
his
Brimstone
shall
scattered
upon
his
habitation
Job
His
roots
shall
dried
beneath
And
above
shall
his
branch
cut
off
Job
His
remembrance
shall
perish
from
the
earth
And
shall
have
name
the
street
Job
shall
driven
from
light
into
darkness
And
chased
out
the
world
Job
shall
have
neither
son
nor
son
son
among
his
people
Nor
any
remaining
where
sojourned
Job
They
that
come
after
shall
astonished
his
day
they
that
went
before
were
affrighted
Job
Surely
such
are
the
dwellings
the
unrighteous
And
this
the
place
him
that
knoweth
not
God
Job
Then
Job
answered
and
said
Job
How
long
will
vex
soul
And
break
pieces
with
words
Job
These
ten
times
have
reproached
are
not
ashamed
that
deal
hardly
with
Job
And
indeed
that
have
erred
Mine
error
remaineth
with
myself
Job
indeed
will
magnify
yourselves
against
And
plead
against
reproach
Job
Know
now
that
God
hath
subverted
cause
And
hath
compassed
with
his
net
Job
Behold
cry
out
wrong
but
not
heard
cry
for
help
but
there
justice
Job
hath
walled
way
that
cannot
pass
And
hath
set
darkness
paths
Job
hath
stripped
glory
And
taken
the
crown
from
head
Job
hath
broken
down
every
side
and
gone
And
hope
hath
plucked
like
tree
Job
hath
also
kindled
his
wrath
against
And
counteth
unto
him
one
his
adversaries
Job
His
troops
come
together
And
cast
their
way
against
And
encamp
round
about
tent
Job
hath
put
brethren
far
from
And
mine
acquaintance
are
wholly
estranged
from
Job
kinsfolk
have
failed
And
familiar
friends
have
forgotten
Job
They
that
dwell
house
and
maids
count
for
stranger
alien
their
sight
Job
call
unto
servant
and
giveth
answer
Though
entreat
him
with
mouth
Job
breath
strange
wife
And
supplication
the
children
mine
own
mother
Job
Even
young
children
despise
arise
they
speak
against
Job
All
familiar
friends
abhor
And
they
whom
loved
are
turned
against
Job
bone
cleaveth
skin
and
flesh
And
escaped
with
the
skin
teeth
Job
Have
pity
upon
have
pity
upon
friends
For
the
hand
God
hath
touched
Job
Why
persecute
God
And
are
not
satisfied
with
flesh
Job
that
words
were
now
written
that
they
were
inscribed
book
Job
That
with
iron
pen
and
lead
They
were
graven
the
rock
for
ever
Job
But
for
know
that
Redeemer
liveth
And
last
will
stand
upon
the
earth
Job
And
after
skin
even
this
body
destroyed
Then
without
flesh
shall
see
God
Job
Whom
even
shall
see
side
And
mine
eyes
shall
behold
and
not
stranger
heart
consumed
within
Job
say
How
will
persecute
him
And
that
the
root
the
matter
found
Job
afraid
the
sword
For
wrath
bringeth
the
punishments
the
sword
That
may
know
there
judgment
Job
Then
answered
Zophar
the
Naamathite
and
said
Job
Therefore
thoughts
give
answer
Even
reason
haste
that
Job
have
heard
the
reproof
which
putteth
shame
And
the
spirit
understanding
answereth
Job
Knowest
thou
not
this
old
time
Since
man
was
placed
upon
earth
Job
That
the
triumphing
the
wicked
short
And
the
joy
the
godless
but
for
moment
Job
Though
his
height
mount
the
heavens
And
his
head
reach
unto
the
clouds
Job
Yet
shall
perish
for
ever
like
his
own
dung
They
that
have
seen
him
shall
say
Where
Job
shall
fly
away
dream
and
shall
not
found
Yea
shall
chased
away
vision
the
night
Job
The
eye
which
saw
him
shall
see
him
more
Neither
shall
his
place
any
more
behold
him
Job
His
children
shall
seek
the
favor
the
poor
And
his
hands
shall
give
back
his
wealth
Job
His
bones
are
full
his
youth
But
shall
lie
down
with
him
the
dust
Job
Though
wickedness
sweet
his
mouth
Though
hide
under
his
tongue
Job
Though
spare
and
will
not
let
But
keep
still
within
his
mouth
Job
Yet
his
food
his
bowels
turned
the
gall
asps
within
him
Job
hath
swallowed
down
riches
and
shall
vomit
them
again
God
will
cast
them
out
his
belly
Job
shall
suck
the
poison
asps
The
viper
tongue
shall
slay
him
Job
shall
not
look
upon
the
rivers
The
flowing
streams
honey
and
butter
Job
That
which
labored
for
shall
restore
and
shall
not
swallow
down
According
the
substance
that
hath
gotten
shall
not
rejoice
Job
For
hath
oppressed
and
forsaken
the
poor
hath
violently
taken
away
house
and
shall
not
build
Job
Because
knew
quietness
within
him
shall
not
save
aught
that
wherein
delighteth
Job
There
was
nothing
left
that
devoured
not
Therefore
his
prosperity
shall
not
endure
Job
the
fulness
his
sufficiency
shall
straits
The
hand
every
one
that
misery
shall
come
upon
him
Job
When
about
fill
his
belly
God
will
cast
the
fierceness
his
wrath
upon
him
And
will
rain
upon
him
while
eating
Job
shall
flee
from
the
iron
weapon
And
the
bow
brass
shall
strike
him
through
Job
draweth
forth
and
cometh
out
his
body
Yea
the
glittering
point
cometh
out
his
gall
Terrors
are
upon
him
Job
All
darkness
laid
for
his
treasures
fire
not
blown
man
shall
devour
him
shall
consume
that
which
left
his
tent
Job
The
heavens
shall
reveal
his
iniquity
And
the
earth
shall
rise
against
him
Job
The
increase
his
house
shall
depart
His
goods
shall
flow
away
the
day
his
wrath
Job
This
the
portion
wicked
man
from
God
And
the
heritage
appointed
unto
him
God
Job
Then
Job
answered
and
said
Job
Hear
diligently
speech
And
let
this
your
consolations
Job
Suffer
and
also
will
speak
And
after
that
have
spoken
mock
Job
for
complaint
man
And
why
should
not
impatient
Job
Mark
and
astonished
And
lay
your
hand
upon
your
mouth
Job
Even
when
remember
troubled
And
horror
taketh
hold
flesh
Job
Wherefore
the
wicked
live
Become
old
yea
wax
mighty
power
Job
Their
seed
established
with
them
their
sight
And
their
offspring
before
their
eyes
Job
Their
houses
are
safe
from
fear
Neither
the
rod
God
upon
them
Job
Their
bull
gendereth
and
faileth
not
Their
cow
calveth
and
casteth
not
her
calf
Job
They
send
forth
their
little
ones
like
flock
And
their
children
dance
Job
They
sing
the
timbrel
and
harp
And
rejoice
the
sound
the
pipe
Job
They
spend
their
days
prosperity
And
moment
they
down
Sheol
Job
And
they
say
unto
God
Depart
from
For
desire
not
the
knowledge
thy
ways
Job
What
the
Almighty
that
should
serve
him
And
what
profit
should
have
pray
unto
him
Job
their
prosperity
not
their
hand
The
counsel
the
wicked
far
from
Job
How
oft
that
the
lamp
the
wicked
put
out
That
their
calamity
cometh
upon
them
That
God
distributeth
sorrows
his
anger
Job
That
they
are
stubble
before
the
wind
And
chaff
that
the
storm
carrieth
away
Job
say
God
layeth
his
iniquity
for
his
children
Let
him
recompense
unto
himself
that
may
know
Job
Let
his
own
eyes
see
his
destruction
And
let
him
drink
the
wrath
the
Almighty
Job
For
what
careth
for
his
house
after
him
When
the
number
his
months
cut
off
Job
Shall
any
teach
God
knowledge
Seeing
judgeth
those
that
are
high
Job
One
dieth
his
full
strength
Being
wholly
ease
and
quiet
Job
His
pails
are
full
milk
And
the
marrow
his
bones
moistened
Job
And
another
dieth
bitterness
soul
And
never
tasteth
good
Job
They
lie
down
alike
the
dust
And
the
worm
covereth
them
Job
Behold
know
your
thoughts
And
the
devices
wherewith
would
wrong
Job
For
say
Where
the
house
the
prince
And
where
the
tent
wherein
the
wicked
dwelt
Job
Have
not
asked
wayfaring
men
And
not
know
their
evidences
Job
That
the
evil
man
reserved
the
day
calamity
That
they
are
led
forth
the
day
wrath
Job
Who
shall
declare
his
way
his
face
And
who
shall
repay
him
what
hath
done
Job
Yet
shall
borne
the
grave
And
men
shall
keep
watch
over
the
tomb
Job
The
clods
the
valley
shall
sweet
unto
him
And
all
men
shall
draw
after
him
there
were
innumerable
before
him
Job
How
then
comfort
vain
Seeing
your
answers
there
remaineth
only
falsehood
Job
Then
answered
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
and
said
Job
Can
man
profitable
unto
God
Surely
that
wise
profitable
unto
himself
Job
any
pleasure
the
Almighty
that
thou
art
righteous
gain
him
that
thou
makest
thy
ways
perfect
Job
for
thy
fear
him
that
reproveth
thee
That
entereth
with
thee
into
judgment
Job
not
thy
wickedness
great
Neither
there
any
end
thine
iniquities
Job
For
thou
hast
taken
pledges
thy
brother
for
nought
And
stripped
the
naked
their
clothing
Job
Thou
hast
not
given
water
the
weary
drink
And
thou
hast
withholden
bread
from
the
hungry
Job
But
for
the
mighty
man
had
the
earth
And
the
honorable
man
dwelt
Job
Thou
hast
sent
widows
away
empty
And
the
arms
the
fatherless
have
been
broken
Job
Therefore
snares
are
round
about
thee
And
sudden
fear
troubleth
thee
Job
darkness
that
thou
canst
not
see
And
abundance
waters
cover
thee
Job
not
God
the
height
heaven
And
behold
the
height
the
stars
how
high
they
are
Job
And
thou
sayest
What
doth
God
know
Can
judge
through
the
thick
darkness
Job
Thick
clouds
are
covering
him
that
seeth
not
And
walketh
the
vault
heaven
Job
Wilt
thou
keep
the
old
way
Which
wicked
men
have
trodden
Job
Who
were
snatched
away
before
their
time
Whose
foundation
was
poured
out
stream
Job
Who
said
unto
God
Depart
from
And
What
can
the
Almighty
for
Job
Yet
filled
their
houses
with
good
things
But
the
counsel
the
wicked
far
from
Job
The
righteous
see
and
are
glad
And
the
innocent
laugh
them
scorn
Job
Saying
Surely
they
that
did
rise
against
are
cut
off
And
the
remnant
them
the
fire
hath
consumed
Job
Acquaint
now
thyself
with
him
and
peace
Thereby
good
shall
come
unto
thee
Job
Receive
pray
thee
the
law
from
his
mouth
And
lay
his
words
thy
heart
Job
thou
return
the
Almighty
thou
shalt
built
thou
put
away
unrighteousness
far
from
thy
tents
Job
And
lay
thou
thy
treasure
the
dust
And
the
gold
Ophir
among
the
stones
the
brooks
Job
And
the
Almighty
will
thy
treasure
And
precious
silver
unto
thee
Job
For
then
shalt
thou
delight
thyself
the
Almighty
And
shalt
lift
thy
face
unto
God
Job
Thou
shalt
make
thy
prayer
unto
him
and
will
hear
thee
And
thou
shalt
pay
thy
vows
Job
Thou
shalt
also
decree
thing
and
shall
established
unto
thee
And
light
shall
shine
upon
thy
ways
Job
When
they
cast
thee
down
thou
shalt
say
There
lifting
And
the
humble
person
will
save
Job
will
deliver
even
him
that
not
innocent
Yea
shall
delivered
through
the
cleanness
thy
hands
Job
Then
Job
answered
and
said
Job
Even
day
complaint
rebellious
stroke
heavier
than
groaning
Job
that
knew
where
might
find
him
That
might
come
even
his
seat
Job
would
set
cause
order
before
him
And
fill
mouth
with
arguments
Job
would
know
the
words
which
would
answer
And
understand
what
would
say
unto
Job
Would
contend
with
the
greatness
his
power
Nay
but
would
give
heed
unto
Job
There
the
upright
might
reason
with
him
should
delivered
for
ever
from
judge
Job
Behold
forward
but
not
there
And
backward
but
cannot
perceive
him
Job
the
left
hand
when
doth
work
but
cannot
behold
him
hideth
himself
the
right
hand
that
cannot
see
him
Job
But
knoweth
the
way
that
take
When
hath
tried
shall
come
forth
gold
Job
foot
hath
held
fast
his
steps
His
way
have
kept
and
turned
not
aside
Job
have
not
gone
back
from
the
commandment
his
lips
have
treasured
the
words
his
mouth
more
than
necessary
food
Job
But
one
mind
and
who
can
turn
him
And
what
his
soul
desireth
even
that
doeth
Job
For
performeth
that
which
appointed
for
And
many
such
things
are
with
him
Job
Therefore
terrified
his
presence
When
consider
afraid
him
Job
For
God
hath
made
heart
faint
And
the
Almighty
hath
terrified
Job
Because
was
not
cut
off
before
the
darkness
Neither
did
cover
the
thick
darkness
from
face
Job
Why
are
times
not
laid
the
Almighty
And
why
not
they
that
know
him
see
his
days
Job
There
are
that
remove
the
landmarks
They
violently
take
away
flocks
and
feed
them
Job
They
drive
away
the
ass
the
fatherless
They
take
the
widow
for
pledge
Job
They
turn
the
needy
out
the
way
The
poor
the
earth
all
hide
themselves
Job
Behold
wild
asses
the
desert
They
forth
their
work
seeking
diligently
for
food
The
wilderness
yieldeth
them
bread
for
their
children
Job
They
cut
their
provender
the
field
And
they
glean
the
vintage
the
wicked
Job
They
lie
all
night
naked
without
clothing
And
have
covering
the
cold
Job
They
are
wet
with
the
showers
the
mountains
And
embrace
the
rock
for
want
shelter
Job
There
are
that
pluck
the
fatherless
from
the
breast
And
take
pledge
the
poor
Job
that
they
about
naked
without
clothing
And
being
hungry
they
carry
the
sheaves
Job
They
make
oil
within
the
walls
these
men
They
tread
their
winepresses
and
suffer
thirst
Job
From
out
the
populous
city
men
groan
And
the
soul
the
wounded
crieth
out
Yet
God
regardeth
not
the
folly
Job
These
are
them
that
rebel
against
the
light
They
know
not
the
ways
thereof
Nor
abide
the
paths
thereof
Job
The
murderer
riseth
with
the
light
killeth
the
poor
and
needy
And
the
night
thief
Job
The
eye
also
the
adulterer
waiteth
for
the
twilight
Saying
eye
shall
see
And
disguiseth
his
face
Job
the
dark
they
dig
through
houses
They
shut
themselves
the
day
time
They
know
not
the
light
Job
For
the
morning
all
them
thick
darkness
For
they
know
the
terrors
the
thick
darkness
Job
Swiftly
they
pass
away
upon
the
face
the
waters
Their
portion
cursed
the
earth
They
turn
not
into
the
way
the
vineyards
Job
Drought
and
heat
consume
the
snow
waters
doth
Sheol
those
that
have
sinned
Job
The
womb
shall
forget
him
The
worm
shall
feed
sweetly
him
shall
more
remembered
And
unrighteousness
shall
broken
tree
Job
devoureth
the
barren
that
beareth
not
And
doeth
not
good
the
widow
Job
Yet
God
preserveth
the
mighty
his
power
riseth
that
hath
assurance
life
Job
God
giveth
them
security
and
they
rest
thereon
And
his
eyes
are
upon
their
ways
Job
They
are
exalted
yet
little
while
and
they
are
gone
Yea
they
are
brought
low
they
are
taken
out
the
way
all
others
And
are
cut
off
the
tops
the
ears
grain
Job
And
not
now
who
will
prove
liar
And
make
speech
nothing
worth
Job
Then
answered
Bildad
the
Shuhite
and
said
Job
Dominion
and
fear
are
with
him
maketh
peace
his
high
places
Job
there
any
number
his
armies
And
upon
whom
doth
not
his
light
arise
Job
How
then
can
man
just
with
God
how
can
clean
that
born
woman
Job
Behold
even
the
moon
hath
brightness
And
the
stars
are
not
pure
his
sight
Job
How
much
less
man
that
worm
And
the
son
man
that
worm
Job
Then
Job
answered
and
said
Job
How
hast
thou
helped
him
that
without
power
How
hast
thou
saved
the
arm
that
hath
strength
Job
How
hast
thou
counselled
him
that
hath
wisdom
And
plentifully
declared
sound
knowledge
Job
whom
hast
thou
uttered
words
And
whose
spirit
came
forth
from
thee
Job
They
that
are
deceased
tremble
Beneath
the
waters
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
Job
Sheol
naked
before
God
And
Abaddon
hath
covering
Job
stretcheth
out
the
north
over
empty
space
And
hangeth
the
earth
upon
nothing
Job
bindeth
the
waters
his
thick
clouds
And
the
cloud
not
rent
under
them
Job
incloseth
the
face
his
throne
And
spreadeth
his
cloud
upon
Job
hath
described
boundary
upon
the
face
the
waters
Unto
the
confines
light
and
darkness
Job
The
pillars
heaven
tremble
And
are
astonished
his
rebuke
Job
stirreth
the
sea
with
his
power
And
his
understanding
smiteth
through
Rahab
Job
his
Spirit
the
heavens
are
garnished
His
hand
hath
pierced
the
swift
serpent
Job
these
are
but
the
outskirts
his
ways
And
how
small
whisper
hear
him
But
the
thunder
his
power
who
can
understand
Job
And
Job
again
took
his
parable
and
said
Job
God
liveth
who
hath
taken
away
right
And
the
Almighty
who
hath
vexed
soul
Job
For
life
yet
whole
And
the
spirit
God
nostrils
Job
Surely
lips
shall
not
speak
uprighteousness
Neither
shall
tongue
utter
deceit
Job
Far
from
that
should
justify
you
Till
die
will
not
put
away
mine
integrity
from
Job
righteousness
hold
fast
and
will
not
let
heart
shall
not
reproach
long
live
Job
Let
mine
enemy
the
wicked
And
let
him
that
riseth
against
the
unrighteous
Job
For
what
the
hope
the
godless
though
get
him
gain
When
God
taketh
away
his
soul
Job
Will
God
hear
his
cry
When
trouble
cometh
upon
him
Job
Will
delight
himself
the
Almighty
And
call
upon
God
all
times
Job
will
teach
you
concerning
the
hand
God
That
which
with
the
Almighty
will
not
conceal
Job
Behold
all
yourselves
have
seen
Why
then
are
become
altogether
vain
Job
This
the
portion
wicked
man
with
God
And
the
heritage
oppressors
which
they
receive
from
the
Almighty
Job
his
children
multiplied
for
the
sword
And
his
offspring
shall
not
satisfied
with
bread
Job
Those
that
remain
him
shall
buried
death
And
his
widows
shall
make
lamentation
Job
Though
heap
silver
the
dust
And
prepare
raiment
the
clay
Job
may
prepare
but
the
just
shall
put
And
the
innocent
shall
divide
the
silver
Job
buildeth
his
house
the
moth
And
booth
which
the
keeper
maketh
Job
lieth
down
rich
but
shall
not
gathered
his
fathers
openeth
his
eyes
and
not
Job
Terrors
overtake
him
like
waters
tempest
stealeth
him
away
the
night
Job
The
east
wind
carrieth
him
away
and
departeth
And
sweepeth
him
out
his
place
Job
For
God
shall
hurl
him
and
not
spare
would
fain
flee
out
his
hand
Job
Men
shall
clap
their
hands
him
And
shall
hiss
him
out
his
place
Job
Surely
there
mine
for
silver
And
place
for
gold
which
they
refine
Job
Iron
taken
out
the
earth
And
copper
molten
out
the
stone
Job
Man
setteth
end
darkness
And
searcheth
out
the
furthest
bound
The
stones
obscurity
and
thick
darkness
Job
breaketh
open
shaft
away
from
where
men
sojourn
They
are
forgotten
the
foot
They
hang
afar
from
men
they
swing
and
fro
Job
for
the
earth
out
cometh
bread
And
underneath
turned
were
fire
Job
The
stones
thereof
are
the
place
sapphires
And
hath
dust
gold
Job
That
path
bird
prey
knoweth
Neither
hath
the
falcon
eye
seen
Job
The
proud
beasts
have
not
trodden
Nor
hath
the
fierce
lion
passed
thereby
Job
putteth
forth
his
hand
upon
the
flinty
rock
overturneth
the
mountains
the
roots
Job
cutteth
out
channels
among
the
rocks
And
his
eye
seeth
every
precious
thing
Job
bindeth
the
streams
that
they
trickle
not
And
the
thing
that
hid
bringeth
forth
light
Job
But
where
shall
wisdom
found
And
where
the
place
understanding
Job
Man
knoweth
not
the
price
thereof
Neither
found
the
land
the
living
Job
The
deep
saith
not
And
the
sea
saith
not
with
Job
cannot
gotten
for
gold
Neither
shall
silver
weighed
for
the
price
thereof
Job
cannot
valued
with
the
gold
Ophir
With
the
precious
onyx
the
sapphire
Job
Gold
and
glass
cannot
equal
Neither
shall
exchanged
for
jewels
fine
gold
Job
mention
shall
made
coral
crystal
Yea
the
price
wisdom
above
rubies
Job
The
topaz
Ethiopia
shall
not
equal
Neither
shall
valued
with
pure
gold
Job
Whence
then
cometh
wisdom
And
where
the
place
understanding
Job
Seeing
hid
from
the
eyes
all
living
And
kept
close
from
the
birds
the
heavens
Job
Destruction
and
Death
say
have
heard
rumor
thereof
with
our
ears
Job
God
understandeth
the
way
thereof
And
knoweth
the
place
thereof
Job
For
looketh
the
ends
the
earth
And
seeth
under
the
whole
heaven
Job
make
weight
for
the
wind
Yea
meteth
out
the
waters
measure
Job
When
made
decree
for
the
rain
And
way
for
the
lightning
the
thunder
Job
Then
did
see
and
declare
established
yea
and
searched
out
Job
And
unto
man
said
Behold
the
fear
the
Lord
that
wisdom
And
depart
from
evil
understanding
Job
And
Job
again
took
his
parable
and
said
Job
that
were
the
months
old
the
days
when
God
watched
over
Job
When
his
lamp
shined
upon
head
And
his
light
walked
through
darkness
Job
was
the
ripeness
days
When
the
friendship
God
was
upon
tent
Job
When
the
Almighty
was
yet
with
And
children
were
about
Job
When
steps
were
washed
with
butter
And
the
rock
poured
out
streams
oil
Job
When
went
forth
the
gate
unto
the
city
When
prepared
seat
the
street
Job
The
young
men
saw
and
hid
themselves
And
the
aged
rose
and
stood
Job
The
princes
refrained
from
talking
And
laid
their
hand
their
mouth
Job
The
voice
the
nobels
was
hushed
And
their
tongue
cleaved
the
roof
their
mouth
Job
For
when
the
ear
heard
then
blessed
And
when
the
eye
saw
gave
witness
unto
Job
Because
delivered
the
poor
that
cried
The
fatherless
also
that
had
none
help
him
Job
The
blessing
him
that
was
ready
perish
came
upon
And
caused
the
widow
heart
sing
for
joy
Job
put
righteousness
and
clothed
justice
was
robe
and
diadem
Job
was
eyes
the
blind
And
feet
was
the
lame
Job
was
father
the
needy
And
the
cause
him
that
knew
not
searched
out
Job
And
brake
the
jaws
the
unrighteous
And
plucked
the
prey
out
his
teeth
Job
Then
said
shall
die
nest
And
shall
multiply
days
the
sand
Job
root
spread
out
the
waters
And
the
dew
lieth
all
night
upon
branch
Job
glory
fresh
And
bow
renewed
hand
Job
Unto
men
gave
ear
and
waited
And
kept
silence
for
counsel
Job
After
words
they
spake
not
again
And
speech
distilled
upon
them
Job
And
they
waited
for
for
the
rain
And
they
opened
their
mouth
wide
for
the
latter
rain
Job
smiled
them
when
they
had
confidence
And
the
light
countenance
they
cast
not
down
Job
chose
out
their
way
and
sat
chief
And
dwelt
king
the
army
one
that
comforteth
the
mourners
Job
But
now
they
that
are
younger
than
have
derision
Whose
fathers
disdained
set
with
the
dogs
flock
Job
Yea
the
strength
their
hands
whereto
should
profit
Men
whom
ripe
age
perished
Job
They
are
gaunt
with
want
and
famine
They
gnaw
the
dry
ground
the
gloom
wasteness
and
desolation
Job
They
pluck
salt
wort
the
bushes
And
the
roots
the
broom
are
their
food
Job
They
are
driven
forth
from
the
midst
men
They
cry
after
them
after
thief
Job
that
they
dwell
frightful
valleys
holes
the
earth
and
the
rocks
Job
Among
the
bushes
they
bray
Under
the
nettles
they
are
gathered
together
Job
They
are
children
fools
yea
children
base
men
They
were
scouraged
out
the
land
Job
And
now
become
their
song
Yea
byword
unto
them
Job
They
abhor
they
stand
aloof
from
And
spare
not
spit
face
Job
For
hath
loosed
his
cord
and
afflicted
And
they
have
cast
off
the
bridle
before
Job
Upon
right
hand
rise
the
rabble
They
thrust
aside
feet
And
they
cast
against
their
ways
destruction
Job
They
mar
path
They
set
forward
calamity
Even
men
that
have
helper
Job
through
wide
breach
they
come
the
midst
the
ruin
they
roll
themselves
upon
Job
Terrors
are
turned
upon
They
chase
mine
honor
the
wind
And
welfare
passed
away
cloud
Job
And
now
soul
poured
out
within
Days
affliction
have
taken
hold
upon
Job
the
night
season
bones
are
pierced
And
the
pains
that
gnaw
take
rest
Job
God
great
force
garment
disfigured
bindeth
about
the
collar
coat
Job
hath
cast
into
the
mire
And
become
like
dust
and
ashes
Job
cry
unto
thee
and
thou
dost
not
answer
stand
and
thou
gazest
Job
Thou
art
turned
cruel
With
the
might
thy
hand
thou
persecutest
Job
Thou
liftest
the
wind
thou
causest
ride
upon
And
thou
dissolvest
the
storm
Job
For
know
that
thou
wilt
bring
death
And
the
house
appointed
for
all
living
Job
Howbeit
doth
not
one
stretch
out
the
hand
his
fall
his
calamity
therefore
cry
for
help
Job
Did
not
weep
for
him
that
was
trouble
Was
not
soul
grieved
for
the
needy
Job
When
looked
for
good
then
evil
came
And
when
waited
for
light
there
came
darkness
Job
heart
troubled
and
resteth
not
Days
affliction
are
come
upon
Job
mourning
without
the
sun
stand
the
assembly
and
cry
for
help
Job
brother
jackals
And
companion
ostriches
Job
skin
black
and
falleth
from
And
bones
are
burned
with
heat
Job
Therefore
harp
turned
mourning
And
pipe
into
the
voice
them
that
weep
Job
made
covenant
with
mine
eyes
How
then
should
look
upon
virgin
Job
For
what
the
portion
from
God
above
And
the
heritage
from
the
Almighty
high
Job
not
calamity
the
unrighteous
And
disaster
the
workers
iniquity
Job
Doth
not
see
ways
And
number
all
steps
Job
have
walked
with
falsehood
And
foot
hath
hasted
deceit
Job
Let
weighed
even
balance
That
God
may
know
mine
integrity
Job
step
hath
turned
out
the
way
And
heart
walked
after
mine
eyes
And
any
spot
hath
cleaved
hands
Job
Then
let
sow
and
let
another
eat
Yea
let
the
produce
field
rooted
out
Job
heart
hath
been
enticed
unto
woman
And
have
laid
wait
neighbor
door
Job
Then
let
wife
grind
unto
another
And
let
others
bow
down
upon
her
Job
For
that
were
heinous
crime
Yea
were
iniquity
punished
the
judges
Job
For
fire
that
consumeth
unto
Destruction
And
would
root
out
all
mine
increase
Job
have
despised
the
cause
man
servant
maid
servant
When
they
contended
with
Job
What
then
shall
when
God
riseth
And
when
visiteth
what
shall
answer
him
Job
Did
not
that
made
the
womb
make
him
And
did
not
one
fashion
the
womb
Job
have
withheld
the
poor
from
their
desire
have
caused
the
eyes
the
widow
fail
Job
have
eaten
morsel
alone
And
the
fatherless
hath
not
eaten
thereof
Job
Nay
from
youth
grew
with
with
father
And
her
have
guided
from
mother
womb
Job
have
seen
any
perish
for
want
clothing
that
the
needy
had
covering
Job
his
loins
have
not
blessed
And
hath
not
been
warmed
with
the
fleece
sheep
Job
have
lifted
hand
against
the
fatherless
Because
saw
help
the
gate
Job
Then
let
shoulder
fall
from
the
shoulder
blade
And
mine
arm
broken
from
the
bone
Job
For
calamity
from
God
terror
And
reason
his
majesty
can
nothing
Job
have
made
gold
hope
And
have
said
the
fine
gold
Thou
art
confidence
Job
have
rejoiced
because
wealth
was
great
And
because
hand
had
gotten
much
Job
have
beheld
the
sun
when
shined
the
moon
walking
brightness
Job
And
heart
hath
been
secretly
enticed
And
mouth
hath
kissed
hand
Job
This
also
were
iniquity
punished
the
judges
For
should
have
denied
the
God
that
above
Job
have
rejoiced
the
destruction
him
that
hated
lifted
myself
when
evil
found
him
Job
Yea
have
not
suffered
mouth
sin
asking
his
life
with
curse
Job
the
men
tent
have
not
said
Who
can
find
one
that
hath
not
been
filled
with
his
meat
Job
The
sojourner
hath
not
lodged
the
street
But
have
opened
doors
the
traveller
Job
like
Adam
have
covered
transgressions
hiding
mine
iniquity
bosom
Job
Because
feared
the
great
multitude
And
the
contempt
families
terrified
that
kept
silence
and
went
not
out
the
door
Job
that
had
one
hear
here
signature
let
the
Almighty
answer
And
that
had
the
indictment
which
mine
adversary
hath
written
Job
Surely
would
carry
upon
shoulder
would
bind
unto
crown
Job
would
declare
unto
him
the
number
steps
prince
would
near
unto
him
Job
land
crieth
out
against
And
the
furrows
thereof
weep
together
Job
have
eaten
the
fruits
thereof
without
money
have
caused
the
owners
thereof
lose
their
life
Job
Let
thistles
grow
instead
wheat
And
cockle
instead
barley
The
words
Job
are
ended
Job
these
three
men
ceased

Job
because
was
righteous
his
own
eyes
Job
Then
was
kindled
the
wrath
Elihu
the
son
Barachel
the
Buzite
the
family
Ram
against
Job
was
his
wrath
kindled
because
justified
himself
rather
than
God
Job
Also
against
his
three
friends
was
his
wrath
kindled
because
they
had
found
answer
and
yet
had
condemned
Job
Job
Now
Elihu
had
waited
speak
unto
Job
because
they
were
elder
than
Job
And
when
Elihu
saw
that
there
was
answer
the
mouth
these
three
men
his
wrath
was
kindled
Job
And
Elihu
the
son
Barachel
the
Buzite
answered
and
said
young
and
are
very
old
Wherefore
held
back
and
durst
not
show
you
mine
opinion
Job
said
Days
should
speak
And
multitude
years
should
teach
wisdom
Job
But
there
spirit
man
And
the
breath
the
Almighty
giveth
them
understanding
Job
not
the
great
that
are
wise
Nor
the
aged
that
understand
justice
Job
Therefore
said
Hearken
also
will
show
mine
opinion
Job
Behold
waited
for
your
words
listened
for
your
reasonings
Whilst
searched
out
what
say
Job
Yea
attended
unto
you
And
behold
there
was
none
that
convinced
Job
that
answered
his
words
among
you
Job
Beware
lest
say
have
found
wisdom
God
may
vanquish
him
not
man
Job
For
hath
not
directed
his
words
against
Neither
will
answer
him
with
your
speeches
Job
They
are
amazed
they
answer
more
They
have
not
word
say
Job
And
shall
wait
because
they
speak
not
Because
they
stand
still
and
answer
more
Job
also
will
answer
part
also
will
show
mine
opinion
Job
For
full
words
The
spirit
within
constraineth
Job
Behold
breast
wine
which
hath
vent
Like
new
wine
skins
ready
burst
Job
will
speak
that
may
refreshed
will
open
lips
and
answer
Job
Let
not
pray
you
respect
any
man
person
Neither
will
give
flattering
titles
unto
any
man
Job
For
know
not
give
flattering
titles
Else
would
Maker
soon
take
away
Job
Howbeit
Job
pray
thee
hear
speech
And
hearken
all
words
Job
Behold
now
have
opened
mouth
tongue
hath
spoken
mouth
Job
words
shall
utter
the
uprightness
heart
And
that
which
lips
know
they
shall
speak
sincerely
Job
The
Spirit
God
hath
made
And
the
breath
the
Almighty
giveth
life
Job
thou
canst
answer
thou
Set
thy
words
order
before
stand
forth
Job
Behold
toward
God
even
thou
art
also
formed
out
the
clay
Job
Behold
terror
shall
not
make
thee
afraid
Neither
shall
pressure
heavy
upon
thee
Job
Surely
thou
hast
spoken
hearing
And
have
heard
the
voice
thy
words
saying
Job
clean
without
transgression
innocent
neither
there
iniquity
Job
Behold
findeth
occasions
against
counteth
for
his
enemy
Job
putteth
feet
the
stocks
marketh
all
paths
Job
Behold
will
answer
thee
this
thou
art
not
just
For
God
greater
than
man
Job
Why
dost
thou
strive
against
him
For
that
giveth
not
account
any
his
matters
Job
For
God
speaketh
once
Yea
twice
though
man
regardeth
not
Job
dream
vision
the
night
When
deep
sleep
falleth
upon
men
slumberings
upon
the
bed
Job
Then
openeth
the
ears
men
And
sealeth
their
instruction
Job
That
may
withdraw
man
from
his
purpose
And
hide
pride
from
man
Job
keepeth
back
his
soul
from
the
pit
And
his
life
from
perishing
the
sword
Job
chastened
also
with
pain
upon
his
bed
And
with
continual
strife
his
bones
Job
that
his
life
abhorreth
bread
And
his
soul
dainty
food
Job
His
flesh
consumed
away
that
cannot
seen
And
his
bones
that
were
not
seen
stick
out
Job
Yea
his
soul
draweth
near
unto
the
pit
And
his
life
the
destroyers
Job
there
with
him
angel
interpreter
one
among
thousand
show
unto
man
what
right
for
him
Job
Then
God
gracious
unto
him
and
saith
Deliver
him
from
going
down
the
pit
have
found
ransom
Job
His
flesh
shall
fresher
than
child
returneth
the
days
his
youth
Job
prayeth
unto
God
and
favorable
unto
him
that
seeth
his
face
with
joy
And
restoreth
unto
man
his
righteousness
Job
singeth
before
men
and
saith
have
sinned
and
perverted
that
which
was
right
And
profited
not
Job
hath
redeemed
soul
from
going
into
the
pit
And
life
shall
behold
the
light
Job
all
these
things
doth
God
work
Twice
yea
thrice
with
man
Job
bring
back
his
soul
from
the
pit
That
may
enlightened
with
the
light
the
living
Job
Mark
well
Job
hearken
unto
Hold
thy
peace
and
will
speak
Job
thou
hast
anything
say
answer
Speak
for
desire
justify
thee
Job
not
hearken
thou
unto
Hold
thy
peace
and
will
teach
thee
wisdom
Job
Moreover
Elihu
answered
and
said
Job
Hear
words
wise
men
And
give
ear
unto
that
have
knowledge
Job
For
the
ear
trieth
words
the
palate
tasteth
food
Job
Let
choose
for
that
which
right
Let
know
among
ourselves
what
good
Job
For
Job
hath
said
righteous
And
God
hath
taken
away
right
Job
Notwithstanding
right
accounted
liar
wound
incurable
though
without
transgression
Job
What
man
like
Job
Who
drinketh
scoffing
like
water
Job
Who
goeth
company
with
the
workers
iniquity
And
walketh
with
wicked
men
Job
For
hath
said
profiteth
man
nothing
That
should
delight
himself
with
God
Job
Therefore
hearken
unto
men
understanding
Far
from
God
that
should
wickedness
And
from
the
Almighty
that
should
commit
iniquity
Job
For
the
work
man
will
render
unto
him
And
cause
every
man
find
according
his
ways
Job
Yea
surety
God
will
not
wickedly
Neither
will
the
Almighty
pervert
justice
Job
Who
gave
him
charge
over
the
earth
who
hath
disposed
the
whole
world
Job
set
his
heart
upon
himself
gather
unto
himself
his
spirit
and
his
breath
Job
All
flesh
shall
perish
together
And
man
shall
turn
again
unto
dust
Job
now
thou
hast
understanding
hear
this
Hearken
the
voice
words
Job
Shall
even
one
that
hateth
justice
govern
And
wilt
thou
condemn
him
that
righteous
and
mighty
Job
Him
that
saith
king
Thou
art
vile
nobles
are
wicked
Job
That
respecteth
not
the
persons
princes
Nor
regardeth
the
rich
more
than
the
poor
For
they
all
are
the
work
his
hands
Job
moment
they
die
even
midnight
The
people
are
shaken
and
pass
away
And
the
mighty
are
taken
away
without
hand
Job
For
his
eyes
are
upon
the
ways
man
And
seeth
all
his
goings
Job
There
darkness
nor
thick
gloom
Where
the
workers
iniquity
may
hide
themselves
Job
For
needeth
not
further
consider
man
That
should
before
God
judgment
Job
breaketh
pieces
mighty
men
ways
past
finding
out
And
setteth
others
their
stead
Job
Therefore
taketh
knowledge
their
works
And
overturneth
them
the
night
that
they
are
destroyed
Job
striketh
them
wicked
men
the
open
sight
others
Job
Because
they
turned
aside
from
following
him
And
would
not
have
regard
any
his
ways
Job
that
they
caused
the
cry
the
poor
come
unto
him
And
heard
the
cry
the
afflicted
Job
When
giveth
quietness
who
then
can
condemn
And
when
hideth
his
face
who
then
can
behold
him
Alike
whether
done
unto
nation
unto
man
Job
That
the
godless
man
reign
not
That
there
none
ensnare
the
people
Job
For
hath
any
said
unto
God
have
borne
chastisement
will
not
offend
any
more
Job
That
which
see
not
teach
thou
have
done
iniquity
will
more
Job
Shall
his
recompense
thou
wilt
that
thou
refusest
For
thou
must
choose
and
not
Therefore
speak
what
thou
knowest
Job
Men
understanding
will
say
unto
Yea
every
wise
man
that
heareth
Job
Job
speaketh
without
knowledge
And
his
words
are
without
wisdom
Job
Would
that
Job
were
tried
unto
the
end
Because
his
answering
like
wicked
men
Job
For
addeth
rebellion
unto
his
sin
clappeth
his
hands
among
And
multiplieth
his
words
against
God
Job
Moreover
Elihu
answered
and
said
Job
Thinkest
thou
this
thy
right
sayest
thou
righteousness
more
than
God
Job
That
thou
sayest
What
advantage
will
unto
thee
And
What
profit
shall
have
more
than
had
sinned
Job
will
answer
thee
And
thy
companions
with
thee
Job
Look
unto
the
heavens
and
see
And
behold
the
skies
which
are
higher
than
thou
Job
thou
hast
sinned
what
effectest
thou
against
him
And
thy
transgressions
multiplied
what
doest
thou
unto
him
Job
thou
righteous
what
givest
thou
him
what
receiveth
thy
hand
Job
Thy
wickedness
may
hurt
man
thou
art
And
thy
righteousness
may
profit
son
man
Job
reason
the
multitude
oppressions
they
cry
out
They
cry
for
help
reason
the
arm
the
mighty
Job
But
none
saith
Where
God
Maker
Who
giveth
songs
the
night
Job
Who
teacheth
more
than
the
beasts
the
earth
And
maketh
wiser
than
the
birds
the
heavens
Job
There
they
cry
but
none
giveth
answer
Because
the
pride
evil
men
Job
Surely
God
will
not
hear
empty
cry
Neither
will
the
Almighty
regard
Job
How
much
less
when
thou
sayest
thou
beholdest
him
not
The
cause
before
him
and
thou
waitest
for
him
Job
But
now
because
hath
not
visited
his
anger
Neither
doth
greatly
regard
arrogance
Job
Therefore
doth
Job
open
his
mouth
vanity
multiplieth
words
without
knowledge
Job
Elihu
also
proceeded
and
said
Job
Suffer
little
and
will
show
thee
For
have
yet
somewhat
say
God
behalf
Job
will
fetch
knowledge
from
afar
And
will
ascribe
righteousness
Maker
Job
For
truly
words
are
not
false
One
that
perfect
knowledge
with
thee
Job
Behold
God
mighty
and
despiseth
not
any
mighty
strength
understanding
Job
preserveth
not
the
life
the
wicked
But
giveth
the
afflicted
their
right
Job
withdraweth
not
his
eyes
from
the
righteous
But
with
kings
upon
the
throne
setteth
them
for
ever
and
they
are
exalted
Job
And
they
bound
fetters
And
taken
the
cords
afflictions
Job
Then
showeth
them
their
work
And
their
transgressions
that
they
have
behaved
themselves
proudly
Job
openeth
also
their
ear
instruction
And
commandeth
that
they
return
from
iniquity
Job
they
hearken
and
serve
him
They
shall
spend
their
days
prosperity
And
their
years
pleasures
Job
But
they
hearken
not
they
shall
perish
the
sword
And
they
shall
die
without
knowledge
Job
But
they
that
are
godless
heart
lay
anger
They
cry
not
for
help
when
bindeth
them
Job
They
die
youth
And
their
life
perisheth
among
the
unclean
Job
delivereth
the
afflicted
their
affliction
And
openeth
their
ear
oppression
Job
Yea
would
have
allured
thee
out
distress
Into
broad
place
where
there
straitness
And
that
which
set
thy
table
would
full
fatness
Job
But
thou
art
full
the
judgment
the
wicked
Judgment
and
justice
take
hold
thee
Job
For
let
not
wrath
stir
thee
against
chastisements
Neither
let
the
greatness
the
ransom
turn
thee
aside
Job
Will
thy
cry
avail
that
thou
not
distress
all
the
forces
thy
strength
Job
Desire
not
the
night
When
peoples
are
cut
off
their
place
Job
Take
heed
regard
not
iniquity
For
this
hast
thou
chosen
rather
than
affliction
Job
Behold
God
doeth
loftily
his
power
Who
teacher
like
unto
him
Job
Who
hath
enjoined
him
his
way
who
can
say
Thou
hast
wrought
unrighteousness
Job
Remember
that
thou
magnify
his
work
Whereof
men
have
sung
Job
All
men
have
looked
thereon
Man
beholdeth
afar
off
Job
Behold
God
great
and
know
him
not
The
number
his
years
unsearchable
Job
For
draweth
the
drops
water
Which
distil
rain
from
his
vapor
Job
Which
the
skies
pour
down
And
drop
upon
man
abundantly
Job
Yea
can
any
understand
the
spreadings
the
clouds
The
thunderings
his
pavilion
Job
Behold
spreadeth
his
light
around
him
And
covereth
the
bottom
the
sea
Job
For
these
judgeth
the
peoples
giveth
food
abundance
Job
covereth
his
hands
with
the
lightning
And
giveth
charge
that
strike
the
mark
Job
The
noise
thereof
telleth
concerning
him
The
cattle
also
concerning
the
storm
that
cometh
Job
Yea
this
heart
trembleth
And
moved
out
its
place
Job
Hear
hear
the
noise
his
voice
And
the
sound
that
goeth
out
his
mouth
Job
sendeth
forth
under
the
whole
heaven
And
his
lightning
unto
the
ends
the
earth
Job
After
voice
roareth
thundereth
with
the
voice
his
majesty
And
restraineth
not
the
lightnings
when
his
voice
heard
Job
God
thundereth
marvellously
with
his
voice
Great
things
doeth
which
cannot
comprehend
Job
For
saith
the
snow
Fall
thou
the
earth
Likewise
the
shower
rain
And
the
showers
his
mighty
rain
Job
sealeth
the
hand
every
man
That
all
men
whom
hath
made
may
know
Job
Then
the
beasts
into
coverts
And
remain
their
dens
Job
Out
the
chamber
the
south
cometh
the
storm
And
cold
out
the
north
Job
the
breath
God
ice
given
And
the
breadth
the
waters
straitened
Job
Yea
ladeth
the
thick
cloud
with
moisture
spreadeth
abroad
the
cloud
his
lightning
Job
And
turned
round
about
his
guidance
That
they
may
whatsoever
commandeth
them
Upon
the
face
the
habitable
world
Job
Whether
for
correction
for
his
land
for
lovingkindness
that
cause
come
Job
Hearken
unto
this
Job
Stand
still
and
consider
the
wondrous
works
God
Job
Dost
thou
know
how
God
layeth
his
charge
upon
them
And
causeth
the
lightning
his
cloud
shine
Job
Dost
thou
know
the
balancings
the
clouds
The
wondrous
works
him
who
perfect
knowledge
Job
How
thy
garments
are
warm
When
the
earth
still
reason
the
south
wind
Job
Canst
thou
with
him
spread
out
the
sky
Which
strong
molten
mirror
Job
Teach
what
shall
say
unto
him
For
cannot
set
our
speech
order
reason
darkness
Job
Shall
told
him
that
would
speak
should
man
wish
that
were
swallowed
Job
And
now
men
see
not
the
light
which
bright
the
skies
But
the
wind
passeth
and
cleareth
them
Job
Out
the
north
cometh
golden
splendor
God
hath
upon
him
terrible
majesty
Job
Touching
the
Almighty
cannot
find
him
out
excellent
power
And
justice
and
plenteous
righteousness
will
not
afflict
Job
Men
therefore
fear
him
regardeth
not
any
that
are
wise
heart
Job
Then
Jehovah
answered
Job
out
the
whirlwind
and
said
Job
Who
this
that
darkeneth
counsel
words
without
knowledge
Job
Gird
now
thy
loins
like
man
For
will
demand
thee
and
declare
thou
unto
Job
Where
wast
thou
when
laid
the
foundations
the
earth
Declare
thou
hast
understanding
Job
Who
determined
the
measures
thereof
thou
knowest
who
stretched
the
line
upon
Job
Whereupon
were
the
foundations
thereof
fastened
who
laid
the
corner
stone
thereof
Job
When
the
morning
stars
sang
together
And
all
the
sons
God
shouted
for
joy
Job
who
shut
the
sea
with
doors
When
brake
forth
had
issued
out
the
womb
Job
When
made
clouds
the
garment
thereof
And
thick
darkness
swaddling
band
for
Job
And
marked
out
for
bound
And
set
bars
and
doors
Job
And
said
Hitherto
shalt
thou
come
but
further
And
here
shall
thy
proud
waves
stayed
Job
Hast
thou
commanded
the
morning
since
thy
days
began
And
caused
the
dayspring
know
its
place
Job
That
might
take
hold
the
ends
the
earth
And
the
wicked
shaken
out
Job
changed
clay
under
the
seal
And
all
things
stand
forth
garment
Job
And
from
the
wicked
their
light
withholden
And
the
high
arm
broken
Job
Hast
thou
entered
into
the

the
sea
hast
thou
walked
the
recesses
the
deep
Job
Have
the

death
been
revealed
unto
thee
hast
thou

death
Job
Hast
thou
comprehended

Declare

Job
Where

And

Job
That
thou

take
the
bound
thereof
And
that
thou

discern
the
paths
the
house
thereof
Job
Doubtless
thou
knowest
for
thou
wast
then
born
And
the
number

Job
Hast
thou
entered
the
treasuries
the

Job
Which

Against

Job
what

Job
Out

The

Canst

the
Pleiades

Job
Canst

Job
Knowest

Canst

thereof
the

Job
Canst
thou
lift
thy

That

may
cover

Job
Canst
thou
send
forth
lightnings
that

And

Who

Who

Job
When

And

Job
Canst

hunt
the

for
the

Job
When

And

Job
Who
provideth

his

When
his

cry
unto
God
And

Job
Knowest

calve
Job
Canst
thou
number
the
months
that
they
fulfil
knowest
thou
the
time
when
they
bring
forth
Job
They
bow
themselves
they
bring
forth
their

They
cast
out
their

Job
Their
young

become

They

Job
Who

sent
out
the
wild
ass
free
who
hath
loosed
the

the
swift
ass
Job
Whose
home
have
made
the
wilderness
And
the
salt
land
his
dwelling
place
Job
scorneth
the
tumult
the
city
Neither
heareth
the
shoutings
the
driver
Job
The
range
the
mountains
his
pasture
And
searcheth
after
every
green
thing
Job
Will
the
wild
content
serve
thee
will
abide
thy
crib
Job
Canst
thou
bind
the
wild
with
his
band
the
furrow
will
harrow
the

after
thee
Job
Wilt
thou
trust
him
because
his
strength
great
wilt
thou
leave
him
thy
labor
Job
Wilt
thou
confide
him
that
will
bring
home
thy
seed
And
gather
the
grain
thy
threshing
floor
Job
The
wings
the
ostrich
wave
proudly
But
are
they
the
pinions
and
plumage
love
Job
For
she
leaveth
her
eggs
the
earth
And
warmeth
them
the
dust
Job
And
forgetteth
that
the
foot
may
crush
them
that
the
wild
beast
may
trample
them
Job
She
dealeth
hardly
with
her
young
ones
they
were
not
hers
Though
her
labor
vain
she
without
fear
Job
Because
God
hath
deprived
her
wisdom
Neither
hath
imparted
her
understanding
Job
What
time
she
lifteth
herself
high
She
scorneth
the
horse
and
his
rider
Job
Hast
thou
given
the
horse
his
might
Hast
thou
clothed
his
neck
with
the
quivering
mane
Job
Hast
thou
made
him
leap
locust
The
glory
his
snorting
terrible
Job
paweth
the
valley
and
rejoiceth
his
strength
goeth
out
meet
the
armed
men
Job
mocketh
fear
and
not
dismayed
Neither
turneth
back
from
the
sword
Job
The
quiver
rattleth
against
him
The
flashing
spear
and
the
javelin
Job
swalloweth
the
ground
with
fierceness
and
rage
Neither
believeth
that
the
voice
the
trumpet
Job
oft
the
trumpet
soundeth
saith
Aha
And
smelleth
the
battle
afar
off
The
thunder
the
captains
and
the
shouting
Job
thy
wisdom
that
the
hawk
soareth
And
stretcheth
her
wings
toward
the
south
Job
thy
command
that
the
eagle
mounteth
And
maketh
her
nest
high
Job
the
cliff
she
dwelleth
and
maketh
her
home
Upon
the
point
the
cliff
and
the
stronghold
Job
From
thence
she
spieth
out
the
prey
Her
eyes
behold
afar
off
Job
Her
young
ones
also
suck
blood
And
where
the
slain
are
there

Job
Moreover
Jehovah
answered
Job
and
said
Job
Shall
that
cavilleth
contend
with
the
Almighty
that
argueth
with
God
let
him
answer
Job
Then
Job
answered
Jehovah
and
said
Job
Behold
small
account
What
shall
answer
thee
lay
hand
upon
mouth
Job
Once
have
spoken
and
will
not
answer
Yea
twice
but
will
proceed
further
Job
Then
Jehovah
answered
Job
out
the
whirlwind
and
said
Job
Gird
thy
loins
now
like
man
will
demand
thee
and
declare
thou
unto
Job
Wilt
thou
even
annul
judgment
Wilt
thou
condemn
that
thou
mayest
justified
Job
hast
thou
arm
like
God
And
canst
thou
thunder
with
voice
like
him
Job
Deck
thyself
now
with
excellency
and
dignity
And
array
thyself
with
honor
and
majesty
Job
Pour
forth
the
overflowings
thine
anger
And
look
upon
every
one
that
proud
and
abase
him
Job
Look
every
one
that
proud
and
bring
him
low
And
tread
down
the
wicked
where
they
stand
Job
Hide
them
the
dust
together
Bind
their
faces
the
hidden
place
Job
Then
will
also
confess
thee
That
thine
own
right
hand
can
save
thee
Job
Behold
now
behemoth
which
made
well
thee
eateth
grass
Job
now
his
strength
his
loins
And
his
force
the
muscles
his

Job
moveth
his
tail
like

The

together
Job
His

His

are

Job

God
only
that
made

Job
Surely
the

bring
him
forth

Where
all

Job
lieth
under
the
lotus
trees
the

reed
and

Job
The

cover
him
with

The

him
about

Behold

Job
Shall

Canst

out
leviathan

Job
Canst
thou
put

Job
Will
make
many
supplications
unto
thee
will
speak
soft

Job
Will

That

Wilt

Job
Will

Will

Canst

Job
Lay

Remember

Job
Behold

Will

None

Job
Who

Out

For
their
heart
was
not
right
with
him
Neither
were
they
faithful
his
covenant
Psalm
But
being
merciful
forgave
their
iniquity
and
destroyed
them
not
Yea
many
time
turned
his
anger
away
And
did
not
stir
all
his
wrath
Psalm
And
remembered
that
they
were
but
flesh

How
oft
did
they
rebel
against
him
the

And
grieve
him
the

Psalm
And
they
turned
again

tempted
God
And
provoked
the
Holy
One
Israel
Psalm
They
remembered
not
his

Nor
the
day
when

Psalm
How
set
his

Egypt

Zoan
Psalm
And

Psalm

And

There

Psalm

Then

They
sang

Psalm

They
soon
forgat
his

They
waited
not
for
his
counsel
Psalm

But
lusted
exceedingly
the
wilderness
And
tempted
God
the
desert
Psalm
106
And
gave
them
their
request
But
sent
leanness
into
their
soul
Psalm
106
They
envied
Moses
also
the
camp
And
Aaron
the
saint
Jehovah
Psalm

The
earth
opened
and

Dathan
And
covered
the

Abiram
Psalm

And
fire
was
kindled
their
company
The
flame
burned
the
wicked
Psalm
106
They
made
calf
Horeb
And
worshipped
molten
image
Psalm
106
Thus
they
changed
their
glory
For
the
likeness
that
eateth
grass
Psalm
106
They
forgat
God
their
Saviour
Who
had
done
great
things
Egypt
Psalm
106
Wondrous
works
the
land
Ham
And
terrible
things
the
Red
Sea
Psalm
106
Therefore
said
that
would
destroy
them
Had
not
Moses
his
chosen
stood
before
him
the
breach
turn
away
his
wrath
lest
should
destroy
them
Psalm
106
Yea
they
despised
the
pleasant
land
They
believed
not
his
word
Psalm
106
But
murmured
their
tents
And
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
Jehovah
Psalm
106
Therefore
sware
unto
them
That
would
overthrow
them
the
wilderness
Psalm
106
And
that
would
overthrow
their
seed
among
the
nations
And
scatter
them
the
lands
Psalm
106
They
joined
themselves
also
unto
Baal
peor
And
ate
the
sacrifices
the
dead
Psalm
106
Thus
they
provoked
him
anger
with
their
doings
And
the
plague
brake
upon
them
Psalm
106
Then
stood
Phinehas
and
executed
judgment
And
the
plague
was
stayed
Psalm
106
And
that
was
reckoned
unto
him
for
righteousness
Unto
all
generations
for
evermore
Psalm
106
They
angered
him
also
the
waters
Meribah
that
went
ill
with
Moses
for
their
sakes
Psalm
106
Because
they
were
rebellious
against
his
spirit
And
spake
unadvisedly
with
his
lips
Psalm
106
They
did
not
destroy
the
peoples
Jehovah
commanded
them
Psalm
106
But
mingled
themselves
with
the
nations
And
learned
their
works
Psalm
106
And
served
their
idols
Which
became
snare
unto
them
Psalm
106
Yea
they
sacrificed
their
sons
and
their
daughters
unto
demons
Psalm
106
And
shed
innocent
blood
Even
the
blood
their
sons
and
their
daughters
Whom
they
sacrificed
unto
the
idols
Canaan
And
the
land
was
polluted
with
blood
Psalm
106
Thus
were
they
defiled
with
their
works
And
played
the
harlot
their
doings
Psalm
106
Therefore
was
the
wrath
Jehovah
kindled
against
his
people
And
abhorred
his
inheritance
Psalm
106
And
gave
them
into
the
hand
the
nations
And
they
that
hated
them
ruled
over
them
Psalm
106
Their
enemies
also
oppressed
them
And
they
were
brought
into
subjection
under
their
hand
Psalm
106
Many
times
did
deliver
them
But
they
were
rebellious
their
counsel
And
were
brought
low
their
iniquity
Psalm
106
Nevertheless
regarded
their
distress
When
heard
their
cry
Psalm
106

all
that
done
under
heaven
sore
travail
that
God
hath
given
the
sons
men
exercised
therewith
Ecclesiastes
have
seen
all
the
works
that
are
done
under
the
sun
and
behold
all
vanity
and
striving
after
wind
Ecclesiastes
That
which
crooked
cannot
made
straight
and
that
which
wanting
cannot
numbered
Ecclesiastes
communed
with
mine
own
heart
saying
have
gotten
great
wisdom
above
all
that
were
before
Jerusalem
yea
heart
hath
had
great
experience
wisdom
and
knowledge
Ecclesiastes
And
applied
heart
know
wisdom
and
know
madness
and
folly
perceived
that
this
also
was
striving
after
wind
Ecclesiastes
For
much
wisdom
much
grief
and
that
increaseth
knowledge
increaseth
sorrow
Ecclesiastes
said
heart
Come
now
will
prove
thee
with
mirth
therefore
enjoy
pleasure
and
behold
this
also
was
vanity
Ecclesiastes
said
laughter
mad
and
mirth
What
doeth
Ecclesiastes
searched
heart
how
cheer
flesh
with
wine
heart
yet
guiding
with
wisdom
and
how
lay
hold
folly
till
might
see
what
was
good
for
the
sons
men
that
they
should
under
heaven
all
the
days
their
life
Ecclesiastes
made
great
works
builded
houses
planted
vineyards
Ecclesiastes
made
gardens
and
parks
and
planted
trees
them
all
kinds
fruit
Ecclesiastes
made
pools
water
water
therefrom
the
forest
where
trees
were
reared
Ecclesiastes
bought
men
servants
and
maid
servants
and
had
servants
born
house
also
had
great
possessions
herds
and
flocks
above
all
that
were
before
Jerusalem
Ecclesiastes
gathered
also
silver
and
gold
and
the
treasure
kings
and
the
provinces
gat
men
singers
and
women
singers
and
the
delights
the
sons
men
musical
instruments
and
that
all
sorts
Ecclesiastes
was
great
and
increased
more
than
all
that
were
before
Jerusalem
also
wisdom
remained
with
Ecclesiastes
And
whatsoever
mine
eyes
desired
kept
not
from
them
withheld
not
heart
from
any
joy
for
heart
rejoiced
because
all
labor
and
this
was
portion
from
all
labor
Ecclesiastes
Then
looked
all
the
works
that
hands
had
wrought
and
the
labor
that
had
labored
and
behold
all
was
vanity
and
striving
after
wind
and
there
was
profit
under
the
sun
Ecclesiastes
And
turned
myself
behold
wisdom
and
madness
and
folly
for
what
can
the
man
that
cometh
after
the
king
even
that
which
hath
been
done
long
ago
Ecclesiastes
Then
saw
that
wisdom
excelleth
folly
far
light
excelleth
darkness
Ecclesiastes
The
wise
man
eyes
are
his
head
and
the
fool
walketh
darkness
and
yet
perceived
that
one
event
happeneth
them
all
Ecclesiastes
Then
said
heart
happeneth
the
fool
will
happen
even
and
why
was
then
more
wise
Then
said
heart
that
this
also
vanity
Ecclesiastes
For
the
wise
man
even
the
fool
there
remembrance
for
ever
seeing
that
the
days
come
all
will
have
been
long
forgotten
And
how
doth
the
wise
man
die
even
the
fool
Ecclesiastes
hated
life
because
the
work
that
wrought
under
the
sun
was
grievous
unto
for
all
vanity
and
striving
after
wind
Ecclesiastes
And
hated
all
labor
wherein
labored
under
the
sun
seeing
that
must
leave
unto
the
man
that
shall
after
Ecclesiastes
And
who
knoweth
whether
will
wise
man
fool
yet
will
have
rule
over
all
labor
wherein
have
labored
and
wherein
have
showed
myself
wise
under
the
sun
This
also
vanity
Ecclesiastes
Therefore
turned
about
cause
heart
despair
concerning
all
the
labor
wherein
had
labored
under
the
sun
Ecclesiastes
For
there
man
whose
labor
with
wisdom
and
with
knowledge
and
with
skilfulness
yet
man
that
hath
not
labored
therein
shall
leave
for
his
portion
This
also
vanity
and
great
evil
Ecclesiastes
For
what
hath
man
all
his
labor
and
the
striving
his
heart
wherein
laboreth
under
the
sun
Ecclesiastes
For
all
his
days
are
but
sorrows
and
his
travail
grief
yea
even
the
night
his
heart
taketh
rest
This
also
vanity
Ecclesiastes
There
nothing
better
for
man
than
that
should
eat
and
drink
and
make
his
soul
enjoy
good
his
labor
This
also
saw
that
from
the
hand
God
Ecclesiastes
For
who
can
eat
who
can
have
enjoyment
more
than
Ecclesiastes
For
the
man
that
pleaseth
him
God
giveth
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
joy
but
the
sinner
giveth
travail
gather
and
heap
that
may
give
him
that
pleaseth
God
This
also
vanity
and
striving
after
wind
Ecclesiastes
For
everything
there
season
and
time
for
every
purpose
under
heaven
Ecclesiastes
time
born
and
time
die
time
plant
and
time
pluck
that
which
planted
Ecclesiastes
time
kill
and
time
heal
time
break
down
and
time
build
Ecclesiastes
time
weep
and
time
laugh
time
mourn
and
time
dance
Ecclesiastes
time
cast
away
stones
and
time
gather
stones
together
time
embrace
and
time
refrain
from
embracing
Ecclesiastes
time
seek
and
time
lose
time
keep
and
time
cast
away
Ecclesiastes
time
rend
and
time
sew
time
keep
silence
and
time

Ecclesiastes
time
love
and
time
hate
time
for
war
and
time
for
peace
Ecclesiastes
What
profit
hath
that
worketh
that
wherein
laboreth
Ecclesiastes
have
seen
the
travail
which
God
hath
given
the
sons
men
exercised
therewith
Ecclesiastes
hath
made
everything
beautiful
its
time
also
hath
set
eternity
their
heart
yet
that
man
cannot
find
out
the
work
that
God
hath
done
from
the
beginning
even
the
end
Ecclesiastes
know
that
there
nothing
better
for
them
than
rejoice
and
good
long
they
live
Ecclesiastes
And
also
that
every
man
should
eat
and
drink
and
enjoy
good
all
his
labor
the
gift
God
Ecclesiastes
know
that
whatsoever
God
doeth
shall
for
ever
nothing
can
put
nor
anything
taken
from
and
God
hath
done
that
men
should
fear
before
him
Ecclesiastes
That
which
hath
been
long
ago
and
that
which
hath
long
ago
been
and
God
seeketh
again
that
which
passed
away
Ecclesiastes
And
moreover
saw
under
the
sun
the
place
justice
that
wickedness
was
there
and
the
place
righteousness
that
wickedness
was
there
Ecclesiastes
said
heart
God
will
judge
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
for
there
time
there
for
every
purpose
and
for
every
work
Ecclesiastes
said
heart
because
the
sons
men
that
God
may
prove
them
and
that
they
may
see
that
they
themselves
are
but
beasts
Ecclesiastes
For
that
which
befalleth
the
sons
men
befalleth
beasts
even
one
thing
befalleth
them
the
one
dieth
dieth
the
other
yea
they
have
all
one
breath
and
man
hath
preeminence
above
the
beasts
for
all
vanity
Ecclesiastes
All
unto
one
place
all
are
the
dust
and
all
turn
dust
again
Ecclesiastes
Who
knoweth
the
spirit
man
whether
goeth
upward
and
the
spirit
the
beast
whether
goeth
downward
the
earth
Ecclesiastes
Wherefore
saw
that
there
nothing
better
than
that
man
should
rejoice
his
works
for
that
his
portion
for
who
shall
bring
him
back
see
what
shall
after
him
Ecclesiastes
Then
returned
and
saw
all
the
oppressions
that
are
done
under
the
sun
and
behold
the
tears
such
were
oppressed
and
they
had
comforter
and
the
side
their
oppressors
there
was
power
but
they
had
comforter
Ecclesiastes
Wherefore
praised
the
dead
that
have
been
long
dead
more
than
the
living
that
are
yet
alive
Ecclesiastes
yea
better
than
them
both
did
esteem
him
that
hath
not
yet
been
who
hath
not
seen
the
evil
work
that
done
under
the
sun
Ecclesiastes
Then
saw
all
labor
and
every
skilful
work
that
for
this
man
envied
his
neighbor
This
also
vanity
and
striving
after
wind
Ecclesiastes
The
fool
foldeth
his
hands
together
and
eateth
his
own
flesh
Ecclesiastes
Better
handful
with
quietness
than
two
handfuls
with
labor
and
striving
after
wind
Ecclesiastes
Then
returned
and
saw
vanity
under
the
sun
Ecclesiastes
There
one
that
alone
and
hath
not
second
yea
hath
neither
son
nor
brother
yet
there
end
all
his
labor
neither
are
his
eyes
satisfied
with
riches
For
whom
then
saith
labor
and
deprive
soul
good
This
also
vanity
yea
sore
travail
Ecclesiastes
Two
are
better
than
one
because
they
have
good
reward
for
their
labor
Ecclesiastes
For
they
fall
the
one
will
lift
his
fellow
but
woe
him
that
alone
when
falleth
and
hath
not
another
lift
him
Ecclesiastes
Again
two
lie
together
then
they
have
warmth
but
how
can
one
warm
alone
Ecclesiastes
And
man
prevail
against
him
that
alone
two
shall
withstand
him
and
threefold
cord
not
quickly
broken
Ecclesiastes
Better
poor
and
wise
youth
than
old
and
foolish
king
who
knoweth
not
how
receive
admonition
any
more
Ecclesiastes
For
out
prison
came
forth
king
yea
even
his
kingdom
was
born
poor
Ecclesiastes
saw
all
the
living
that
walk
under
the
sun
that
they
were
with
the
youth
the
second
that
stood
his
stead
Ecclesiastes
There
was
end
all
the
people
even
all
them
over
whom
was
yet
they
that
come
after
shall
not
rejoice
him
Surely
this
also
vanity
and
striving
after
wind
Ecclesiastes
Keep
thy
foot
when
thou
goest
the
house
God
for
draw
nigh
hear
better
than
give
the
sacrifice
fools
for
they
know
not
that
they
evil
Ecclesiastes
not
rash
with
thy
mouth
and
let
not
thy
heart
hasty
utter
anything
before
God
for
God
heaven
and
thou
upon
earth
therefore
let
thy
words
few
Ecclesiastes
For
dream
cometh
with
multitude
business
and
fool
voice
with
multitude
words
Ecclesiastes
When
thou
vowest
vow
unto
God
defer
not
pay
for
hath
pleasure
fools
pay
that
which
thou
vowest
Ecclesiastes
Better
that
thou
shouldest
not
vow
than
that
thou
shouldest
vow
and
not
pay
Ecclesiastes
Suffer
not
thy
mouth
cause
thy
flesh
sin
neither
say
thou
before
the
angel
that
was
error
wherefore
should
God
angry
thy
voice
and
destroy
the
work
thy
hands
Ecclesiastes
For
the
multitude
dreams
there
are
vanities
and
many
words
but
fear
thou
God
Ecclesiastes
thou
seest
the
oppression
the
poor
and
the
violent
taking
away
justice
and
righteousness
province
marvel
not
the
matter
for
one
higher
than
the
high
regardeth
and
there
are
higher
than
they
Ecclesiastes
Moreover
the
profit
the
earth
for
all
the
king
himself
served
the
field
Ecclesiastes
that
loveth
silver
shall
not
satisfied
with
silver
nor
that
loveth
abundance
with
increase
this
also
vanity
Ecclesiastes
When
goods
increase
they
are
increased
that
eat
them
and
what
advantage
there
the
owner
thereof
save
the
beholding
them
with
his
eyes
Ecclesiastes
The
sleep
laboring
man
sweet
whether
eat
little
much
but
the
fulness
the
rich
will
not
suffer
him
sleep
Ecclesiastes
There
grievous
evil
which
have
seen
under
the
sun
namely
riches
kept
the
owner
thereof
his
hurt
Ecclesiastes
and
those
riches
perish
evil
adventure
and
hath
begotten

there
nothing

Ecclesiastes
came
forth
from
his
mother
womb
naked
shall
again
came
and
shall
take
nothing
for
his
labor
which
may
carry
away
his
hand
Ecclesiastes
And
this
also
grievous
evil
that
all
points
came
shall
and
what
profit
hath
that
laboreth
for
the
wind
Ecclesiastes
All
his
days
also
eateth
darkness
and
sore
vexed
and
hath
sickness
and
wrath
Ecclesiastes
Behold
that
which
have
seen
good
and
comely
for

eat
and

and
enjoy
good
all
his
labor
wherein
laboreth
under
the

all
the

his

which
God

given
him
for

his

Ecclesiastes
Every

God
hath
given
riches
and
wealth
and
hath
given
him
power
eat
thereof
and
take
his
portion
and
rejoice
his
labor
this
the
gift
God
Ecclesiastes
For
shall
not
much
remember
the
days
his
life
because
God
answereth
him
the
joy
his
heart
Ecclesiastes
There
evil
which

and
heavy
upon

Ecclesiastes
man

and

moreover
have

for

Ecclesiastes
moreover

Ecclesiastes
All

For
what
advantage
hath
the
wise
more
than
the
fool
what
hath
the
poor
man
that
knoweth
how
walk

Ecclesiastes
Better

Ecclesiastes
Whatsoever

For

For

Better

Above

Isaiah
And
one
cried

Holy

Isaiah
And
the

Isaiah
Then

Isaiah
and
touched

said
this
hath
touched
thy

thine
iniquity
taken
away
and
thy
sin
forgiven
Isaiah
And
heard
the
voice
the

Isaiah
Make

and
shut

Then
said

And
answered
Until

Because

Woe
unto

Isaiah
turn
aside
the
needy
from

and
rob
the

their

that

and
that
they

Isaiah
And
what

which

come
from

whom

Isaiah
They

said
unto

Say
now
Hezekiah
Thus
saith
the
great
king
the
king
Assyria
What
confidence
this
wherein
thou
trustest
Isaiah
say
thy

and
strength
for
the

are
but
vain
words
now
whom
dost
thou
trust
that
thou
hast
rebelled
against
Isaiah
Behold
thou
trustest
upon
the
staff
this
bruised
reed
even
upon
Egypt
whereon
man
lean
will

pierce
Pharaoh

Now
therefore
pray
thee

And

the
Syrian
language
for
understand
and
speak
not
the
Jews

But
Rabshakeh
said
Hath

sent
thy
master
and
thee

not
sent
the
men
that

Isaiah
Rabshakeh
returned

And

from

and
read
and
Hezekiah
went
unto
the
house

and
spread
before

And
Hezekiah
prayed
unto
Jehovah
saying
Isaiah

thou
art
the

Isaiah
Incline
thine

open
thine

Jehovah
and

and
hear
all
the

Sennacherib
who
hath

Jehovah
the
kings
Assyria
have
laid
waste
all
the
countries
and
their
land
Isaiah
and
have
cast
their
gods
into
the
fire
for
they
were
gods
but

therefore
they
have
destroyed
them
Isaiah
Now
therefore
Jehovah
our
God
save
from
his
hand
that
all
the
kingdoms
the

may
know
that
thou
art
Jehovah
even
thou

Isaiah
Then
Isaiah
the
son
Amoz
sent
unto
Hezekiah
saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Whereas
thou
hast
prayed
against
Sennacherib
king
Assyria
Isaiah
this
the
word
which
Jehovah
hath
spoken
concerning

The
virgin
daughter
Zion
hath
despised
thee
and
laughed
thee

the
daughter
Jerusalem
hath
shaken
her
head
thee
Isaiah
Whom
hast
thou
defied
and
blasphemed
and
against

hast
thou
exalted
thy
voice
and
lifted
thine
eyes
high
even
against
the
Holy
One
Israel
Isaiah
thy
servants
hast
thou
defied
the
Lord
and
hast
said
With

long
ago
and
formed
ancient
times
now

brought

that

thine

Isaiah
Therefore
their

Isaiah
But

Because

For

The

Therefore

Isaiah
For

Isaiah
And
the

went
forth
and
smote

And

Isaiah
those

And
Isaiah
the

came
him
and
said
unto
him
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Set

Isaiah
Then
Hezekiah
turned
his

and
prayed
unto
Jehovah
Isaiah
and
said
Remember

And
Hezekiah
was

and

all
that

there
was
nothing

that
Hezekiah
showed

not
Isaiah
Then
came
Isaiah
the

unto

Hezekiah
and
said
unto
him
What
said
these

and
from
whence
came
they
unto

And
Hezekiah
said
They
are
come
from

country
unto
even
from
Babylon
Isaiah
Then
said
What
have
they
seen
thy
house
And
Hezekiah
answered
All
that
house
have
they
seen
there
nothing
among
treasures
that
have
not
showed

Isaiah
Then
said
Isaiah
Hezekiah
Hear

Isaiah
Behold

whom
thou
shalt
beget
shall

Then
said

Isaiah
For

him
that
there

Isaiah
And
saw
that
there

For

Isaiah
Wilt

Isaiah

For

Jeremiah
And
will
utter
judgments
against
them
touching
all
their
wickedness
that
they
have
forsaken
and
have
burned
incense
unto
other

Jeremiah
Thou
therefore

For

And
they
shall

Jeremiah
And
the

Jehovah
came
saying
Jeremiah
and

saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
remember
for
thee
the

how
thou

Hear

Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
What
unrighteousness
have
your
fathers
found
that
they
are
gone
far
from
and
have
walked
after
vanity
and
are
become
vain
Jeremiah
Neither
said
they
Where
Jehovah
that
brought
out
the
land
Egypt
that
led
through
the
wilderness
through

deserts
and
pits
through

drought
and
the
shadow
death
through

that
none
passed
through
and
where
man
dwelt
Jeremiah
And
brought
you
into
plentiful
land
eat
the
fruit
thereof
and
the
goodness
thereof
but
when
entered
defiled
land
and
made
heritage
abomination
Jeremiah
The
priests
said
not
Where
Jehovah
and
they
that
handle
the
law
knew
not
the
rulers
also
transgressed
against
and
the
prophets
prophesied
Baal
and
walked
after
things
that
not
profit
Jeremiah
Wherefore
will
yet
contend
with
you
saith
Jehovah
and
with
your
children
children
will
contend
Jeremiah
For
pass
over
the
isles
Kittim
and
see
and
send
unto
Kedar
and
consider
diligently
and
see
there
hath
been
such
thing
Jeremiah
Hath
nation
changed
its
gods
which
yet
are
gods
but
people
have
changed
their
glory
for
that
which
doth
not
profit
Jeremiah
astonished
heavens
this
and
horribly
afraid
very
desolate
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
For
people
have
committed
two
evils
they
have
forsaken
the

and
hewed
them
out
cisterns
broken
cisterns
that

Jeremiah
Israel

Jeremiah
The

have
roared
upon
him
and

and
they
have
made
his

waste
his
cities

burned
without

Jeremiah
The

Jeremiah
Hast
thou
not
procured
this
unto
thyself
that
thou
hast
forsaken
Jehovah
thy
God
when

Jeremiah
And
now
what

what
hast
thou
the

Thine
own
wickedness
shall
correct
thee
and
thy
backslidings
shall
reprove
thee
know
therefore
and
see
that
evil
thing
and
bitter
that
thou
hast
forsaken
Jehovah
thy
God
and
that
fear
not

saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
hosts
Jeremiah
For
old
time
have
broken
thy
yoke
and
burst
thy
bonds
and
thou
saidst

not
serve
for
upon
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
thou
didst
bow
thyself
playing
the
harlot
Jeremiah
Yet
had
planted
thee
noble
vine
wholly
right
seed
how
then
art
thou
turned
into
the
degenerate

foreign
vine
unto
Jeremiah
For
though
thou

and
take
thee
much
soap
yet
thine
iniquity
marked

saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Jeremiah
How

after
the
Baalim

what
thou
hast
done
thou

her
away
all

Jeremiah
Withhold
thy

from
being
unshod
and
thy
throat
from
thirst
but
thou
saidst
vain
for
have
loved
strangers
and
after
them
will
Jeremiah
the
thief
ashamed
when
found
the
house
Israel
ashamed
they
their
kings
their
princes
and
their
priests
and
their
prophets
Jeremiah
who
say
stock
Thou
art

Thou
hast
brought
forth
for
they
have
turned
their
back
unto

not

but
the

Arise

But
where

Jeremiah
Can

people
have
forgotten
days
without

Jeremiah
How
trimmest
thou
thy
way
seek
love
therefore
even
the
wicked
women
hast
thou
taught
thy
ways
Jeremiah
Also
thy
skirts
found
the
blood
the
souls
the
innocent
poor
thou
didst
not
find
them
breaking
but
because
all
these
things
Jeremiah
Yet
thou
saidst
innocent
surely
his
anger
turned
away
from
Behold
will
enter
into
judgment
with
thee
because
thou
sayest
have
not
sinned
Jeremiah
Why
gaddest
thou
about
much
change
thy
way
thou
shalt
ashamed
Egypt
also
thou
wast
ashamed
Assyria
Jeremiah
From
thence
also
shalt
thou
forth
with
thy
hands
upon
thy
head
for
Jehovah
hath
rejected
those
whom
thou
trustest
and
thou
shalt
not
prosper
with
them
Jeremiah
They
say
man
put
away
his
wife
and
she
from
him
and
become
another
man
will
return
unto
her
again
will
not
that
land
greatly
polluted
But
thou
hast
played
the
harlot
with
many
lovers
yet
return
again
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
Lift
thine
eyes
unto
the
bare
heights
and
see
where
hast
thou
not
been
lain
with
the
ways
hast
thou
sat
for
them
Arabian
the
wilderness
and
thou
hast
polluted
the
land
with
thy
whoredoms
and
with
thy
wickedness
Jeremiah
Therefore
the
showers
have
been
withholden
and
there
hath
been
latter
rain
yet
thou
hast
harlot
forehead
thou
refusedst
ashamed
Jeremiah
Wilt
thou
not
from
this
time
cry
unto
Father
thou
art
the
guide
youth
Jeremiah
Will
retain
his
anger
for
ever
will
keep
the
end
Behold
thou
hast
spoken
and
hast
done
evil
things
and
hast
had
thy
way
Jeremiah
Moreover
Jehovah
said
unto
the
days
Josiah
the
king
Hast
thou
seen
that
which
backsliding
Israel
hath
done
she
gone
upon
every
high
mountain
and
under
every
green
tree
and
there
hath
played
the
harlot
Jeremiah
And
said
after
she
had
done
all
these
things
She
will
return
unto
but
she
returned
not
and
her
treacherous
sister
Judah
saw
Jeremiah
And
saw
when
for
this
very
cause
that
backsliding
Israel
had
committed
adultery
had
put
her
away
and
given
her
bill
divorcement
yet
treacherous
Judah
her
sister
feared
not
but
she
also
went
and
played
the
harlot
Jeremiah
And
came
pass
through
the
lightness
her
whoredom
that
the
land
was
polluted
and
she
committed
adultery
with
stones
and
with
stocks
Jeremiah
And
yet
for
all
this
her
treacherous
sister
Judah
hath
not
returned
unto
with
her
whole
heart
but
feignedly
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Backsliding
Israel
hath
showed
herself
more
righteous
than
treacherous
Judah
Jeremiah
and
proclaim
these
words
toward
the
north
and
say
Return
thou
backsliding
Israel
saith
Jehovah
will
not
look
anger
upon
you
for
merciful
saith
Jehovah
will
not
keep
anger
for
ever
Jeremiah
Only
acknowledge
thine
iniquity
that
thou
hast
transgressed
against
Jehovah
thy
God
and
hast
scattered
thy
ways
the
strangers
under
every
green
tree
and
have
not
obeyed
voice
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
Return

And
will
give
you

Jeremiah
And
shall
come

when

multiplied
and
increased
the

those
days

Jehovah
they
shall
say

The

shall
gathered
unto
the
name
Jehovah
Jerusalem
neither
shall
they
walk
any
more
after
the
stubbornness
their
evil
heart
Jeremiah
those
days
the
house
Judah
shall
walk
with
the
house
Israel
and
they
shall
come
together
out
the
land
the
north
the
land
that
gave
for
inheritance
unto
your

Jeremiah
But
said
How

put
thee
among

children
and
give
thee
pleasant
land
goodly
heritage
the
hosts
the
nations
and
said

Jeremiah
Surely

the
weeping
and
the
supplications
the
children
Israel
because
they
have
perverted
their

they
have
forgotten
Jehovah
their

Jeremiah
Return
backsliding

heal
your
backslidings
Behold
are
come
unto
thee
for
thou
art
Jehovah
our
God

Truly
vain
the
help
that
looked
for
from
the
hills
the
tumult
the
mountains
truly
Jehovah
our
God
the
salvation
Israel
Jeremiah
But
the
shameful
thing
hath
devoured
the
labor
our
fathers
from
our
youth
their
flocks
and
their
herds
their
sons
and
their
daughters
Jeremiah
Let
lie
down
our
shame
and
let
our
confusion
cover
for
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
our
God
and
our
fathers
from
our
youth
even
unto
this
day
and
have
not
obeyed
the

Jeremiah
thou
wilt
return
Israel
saith
Jehovah
thou
wilt
return
unto
and
thou
wilt
put
away
thine
abominations
out

then
shalt
thou
not
removed
Jeremiah
and
thou
shalt
swear
Jehovah
liveth
truth
justice
and
righteousness
and
the
nations
shall
bless
themselves
him
and

shall
they
glory
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
the
men
Judah
and
Jerusalem
Break
your
fallow
ground
and
sow
not
among
thorns
Jeremiah
Circumcise
yourselves
Jehovah
and
take

Judah
and
inhabitants
Jerusalem
lest
wrath

Blow

aloud
and
say
Assemble

Jeremiah
Set

destruction
Jeremiah

Jeremiah
For
this
gird
you
with
sackcloth
lament
and
wail
for
the
fierce
anger
Jehovah
not
turned
back
from
Jeremiah
And
shall
come

shall
perish
and
the
heart
the

Jeremiah
Then
said
Lord
Jehovah
surely
thou
hast
greatly
deceived
this
people
and
Jerusalem
saying
shall
have
peace
whereas
the
sword
reacheth
unto
the

Jeremiah
that

toward
the

people
not
winnow
nor

Jeremiah
full
wind
from
these
shall
come
for
now
will
also
utter
judgments
against
them
Jeremiah
Behold
shall
come
clouds
and
his

Woe

Jeremiah
Jerusalem
wash
thy

from
wickedness
that
thou

How
long
shall
thine
evil
thoughts
lodge
within
thee
Jeremiah
For

Ephraim
Jeremiah
Make

Thy

unto
thee
this
thy
wickedness
for

for
reacheth
unto
thy

Jeremiah
anguish
anguish

very
heart
heart
disquieted
cannot
hold
peace
because
thou
hast
heard

the
sound
the
trumpet
the
alarm
war
Jeremiah
Destruction
upon
destruction
cried
for
the
whole
land
laid
waste
suddenly
are
tents
destroyed
and
curtains
moment
Jeremiah
How
long
shall
see
the
standard
and
hear
the
sound
the
trumpet
Jeremiah
For
people
are
foolish
they
know
not
they
are
sottish
children
and
they
have
understanding
they
are
wise
evil
but
good
they
have
knowledge
Jeremiah
beheld
the
earth
and
was
waste
and
void
and
the
heavens
and
they
had
light
Jeremiah
beheld
the
mountains
and
they
trembled
and
all
the
hills
moved
and
fro
Jeremiah
beheld
and
there
was
man
and
all
the
birds
the
heavens
were
fled
Jeremiah
beheld
and
the
fruitful
field
was
wilderness
and
all
the
cities
thereof
were
broken
down
the
presence
Jehovah
and
before
his
fierce
anger
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
The
whole
land
shall
desolation
yet
will
not
make
full
end
Jeremiah
For
this
shall
the
earth
mourn
and
the
heavens
above
black
because
have
spoken
have
purposed
and
have
not
repented
neither
will
turn
back
from
Jeremiah
Every
city
fleeth
for
the
noise
the
horsemen
and
bowmen
they
into
the
thickets
and
climb
upon
the
rocks
every
city
forsaken
and
not
man
dwelleth
therein
Jeremiah
And
thou
when
thou
art
made
desolate
what
wilt
thou
Though
thou
clothest
thyself
with
scarlet
though
thou
deckest
thee
with
ornaments
gold
though
thou
enlargest
thine
eyes
with
paint
vain
dost
thou
make
thyself
fair
thy
lovers
despise
thee
they
seek
thy
life
Jeremiah
For
have
heard
voice
woman
travail
the
anguish
her
that
bringeth
forth
her
first
child
the
voice
the
daughter
Zion
that
gaspeth
for
breath
that
spreadeth
her
hands
saying
Woe
now
for
soul
fainteth
before
the
murderers
Jeremiah
Run
and
fro
through
the
streets
Jerusalem
and
see
now
and
know
and
seek
the
broad
places
thereof
can
find
man
there
any
that
doeth
justly
that
seeketh
truth
and
will
pardon
her
Jeremiah
And
though
they
say
Jehovah
liveth
surely
they
swear
falsely
Jeremiah
Jehovah
not
thine
eyes
look
upon
truth
thou
hast
stricken
them
but
they
were
not
grieved
thou
hast
consumed
them
but
they
have
refused
receive
correction
they
have
made
their
faces
harder
than
rock
they
have
refused
return
Jeremiah
Then
said
Surely
these
are
poor
they
are
foolish
for
they
know
not
the
way
Jehovah
nor
the
law
their
God
Jeremiah
will
get
unto
the
great
men
and
will
speak
unto
them
for
they
know
the
way
Jehovah
and
the
law
their
God
But
these
with
one
accord
have
broken
the
yoke
and
burst
the
bonds
Jeremiah
Wherefore
lion
out
the
forest
shall
slay
them
wolf
the
evenings
shall
destroy
them
leopard
shall
watch
against
their
cities
every
one
that
goeth
out
thence
shall
torn
pieces
because
their
transgressions
are
many
and
their
backslidings
are
increased
Jeremiah
How
can
pardon
thee
thy
children
have
forsaken
and
sworn
them
that
are
gods
when
had
fed
them
the
full
they
committed
adultery
and
assembled
themselves
troops
the
harlots
houses
Jeremiah
they
were
fed
horses
roaming
large
every
one
neighed
after
his
neighbor
wife
Jeremiah
Shall
not
visit
for
these
things
saith
Jehovah
and
shall
not
soul
avenged
such
nation
this
Jeremiah
upon
her
walls
and
destroy
but
make
not
full
end
take
away
her
branches
for
they
are
not
Jehovah
Jeremiah
For
the
house
Israel
and
the
house
Judah
have
dealt
very
treacherously

Jehovah
Jeremiah
They
have
denied
Jehovah
and
said
not
neither

Jeremiah
and
the

Wherefore
thus

Because

Their

And
they

they
shall
beat
down
thy
fortified

wherein
thou
trustest
with

Jeremiah
But
even
those
days
saith
Jehovah
will
not
make
full
end
with
you
Jeremiah
And
shall
come

when
shall
say
Wherefore

But

Neither

Jeremiah
Your
iniquities
have
turned
away
these

Therefore

Jeremiah
For
from

They

saying
Peace

Jeremiah
Were

they
blush
therefore
they
shall
fall

Jeremiah
And
set
watchmen
over
you
saying
Hearken

Therefore

Hear

your

Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold

people
and
the

Jeremiah
They

Jeremiah
They

Jeremiah
The

Jeremiah
Refuse

The

saying
Jeremiah
Stand

Jeremiah
Trust

For

Jeremiah
oppress
not
the

the
fatherless
and
the
widow
and
shed
not
innocent
blood
this
place
neither
walk
after
other

your

hurt
Jeremiah
then
will
cause
you
dwell
this
place
the
land
that
gave
your
fathers
from
old
even
for
evermore
Jeremiah
Behold
trust
lying
words
that

profit
Jeremiah
Will
steal
murder
and
commit
adultery
and
swear
falsely
and
burn
incense
unto
Baal
and
walk
after
other
gods
that
have
not
known
Jeremiah
and
come
and
stand
before
this
house
which
called

and
say
are
delivered
that
may
all
these
abominations
Jeremiah
this
house
which
called

become
den
robbers
your
eyes
Behold
even
have
seen
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
But
now
unto
place
which
was
Shiloh
where
caused
name
dwell
the
first
and
see
what
did
for
the
wickedness
people
Israel
Jeremiah
And
now
because
have
done
all
these
works
saith
Jehovah
and
spake
unto
you
rising
early
and
speaking
but
heard
not
and
called
you
but
answered
not
Jeremiah
therefore
will
unto
the
house
which
called
name
wherein
trust
and
unto
the
place
which
gave
you
and
your
fathers
did
Shiloh
Jeremiah
And
will
cast
you
out
sight
have
cast
out
all
your
brethren
even
the
whole
seed
Ephraim
Jeremiah
Therefore
pray
not
thou
for
this
people
neither
lift
cry
nor
prayer
for
them
neither
make
intercession
for
will
not
hear
thee
Jeremiah
Seest
thou
not
what
they
the
cities
Judah
and
the
streets
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
The
children
gather
wood
and
the
fathers
kindle
the
fire
and
the
women
knead
the
dough
make
cakes
the
queen
heaven
and
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
other
gods
that
they
may
provoke
anger
Jeremiah
they
provoke
anger
saith
Jehovah
they
not
provoke
themselves
the
confusion
their
own
faces
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Behold
mine
anger
and
wrath
shall
poured
out
upon
this
place
upon
man
and
upon
beast
and
upon
the
trees
the
field
and
upon
the
fruit
the
ground
and
shall
burn
and
shall
not
quenched
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
Add
your
burnt
offerings
unto
your
sacrifices
and
eat
flesh
Jeremiah
For
spake
not
unto
your
fathers
nor
commanded
them
the
day
that
brought
them
out
the
land
Egypt
concerning
burnt
offerings
sacrifices
Jeremiah
but
this
thing
commanded
them
saying
Hearken
unto
voice
and
will
your
God
and
shall
people
and
walk
all
the
way
that
command
you
that
may
well
with
you
Jeremiah
But
they
hearkened
not
nor
inclined
their
ear
but
walked
their
own
counsels
and
the
stubbornness
their
evil
heart
and
went
backward
and
not
forward
Jeremiah
Since
the
day
that
your
fathers
came
forth
out
the
land
Egypt
unto
this
day
have
sent
unto
you
all
servants
the
prophets
daily
rising
early
and
sending
them
Jeremiah
yet
they
hearkened
not
unto
nor
inclined
their
ear
but
made
their
neck
stiff
they
did
worse
than
their
fathers
Jeremiah
And
thou
shalt
speak
all
these
words
unto
them
but
they
will
not
hearken
thee
thou
shalt
also
call
unto
them
but
they
will
not
answer
thee
Jeremiah
And
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
This
the
nation
that
hath
not
hearkened
the
voice
Jehovah
their
God
nor
received
instruction
truth
perished
and
cut
off
from
their
mouth
Jeremiah
Cut
off
thy
hair
Jerusalem
and
cast
away
and
take
lamentation
the
bare
heights
for
Jehovah
hath
rejected
and
forsaken
the
generation
his
wrath
Jeremiah
For
the
children
Judah
have
done
that
which
evil
sight
saith
Jehovah
they
have
set
their
abominations
the
house
which
called
name
defile
Jeremiah
And
they
have
built
the
high
places
Topheth
which
the
valley
the
son
Hinnom
burn
their
sons
and
their
daughters
the
fire
which
commanded
not
neither
came
into
mind
Jeremiah
Therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
Jehovah
that
shall
more
called
Topheth
nor
The
valley
the
son
Hinnom
but
The
valley
Slaughter
for
they
shall
bury
Topheth
till
there
place
bury
Jeremiah
And
the
dead
bodies
this
people
shall
food
for
the
birds
the
heavens
and
for
the
beasts
the
earth
and
none
shall
frighten
them
away
Jeremiah
Then
will
cause
cease
from
the
cities
Judah
and
from
the
streets
Jerusalem
the
voice
mirth
and
the
voice
gladness
the
voice
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
the
bride
for
the
land
shall
become
waste
Jeremiah
that
time
saith
Jehovah
they
shall
bring
out
the
bones
the
kings
Judah
and
the
bones
his
princes
and
the
bones
the
priests
and
the
bones
the
prophets
and
the
bones
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
out
their
graves
Jeremiah
and
they
shall
spread
them
before
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
all
the
host
heaven
which
they
have
loved
and
which
they
have
served
and
after
which
they
have
walked
and
which
they
have
sought
and
which
they
have
worshipped
they
shall
not
gathered
nor
buried
they
shall
for
dung
upon
the
face
the
earth
Jeremiah
And
death
shall
chosen
rather
than
life
all
the
residue
that
remain
this
evil
family
that
remain
all
the
places
whither
have
driven
them
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Jeremiah
Moreover
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Shall
men
fall
and
not
rise
again
Shall
one
turn
away
and
not
return
Jeremiah
Why
then
this
people
Jerusalem
slidden
back
perpetual
backsliding
they
hold
fast
deceit
they
refuse
return
Jeremiah
hearkened
and
heard
but
they
spake
not
aright
man
repenteth
him
his
wickedness
saying
What
have
done
every
one
turneth
his
course
horse
that
rusheth
headlong
the
battle
Jeremiah
Yea
the
stork
the
heavens
knoweth
her
appointed
times
and
the
turtle
dove
and
the
swallow
and
the
crane
observe
the
time
their
coming
but
people
know
not
the
law
Jehovah
Jeremiah
How
say
are
wise
and
the
law
Jehovah
with
But
behold
the
false
pen
the
scribes
hath
wrought
falsely
Jeremiah
The
wise
men
are
put
shame
they
are
dismayed
and
taken
they
have
rejected
the
word
Jehovah
and
what
manner
wisdom

Jeremiah
Therefore
will
give
their
wives
unto
others
and
their
fields
them
that
shall
possess
them
for
every
one
from
the
least
even
unto
the
greatest
given
covetousness
from
the
prophet
even
unto
the
priest
every
one
dealeth
falsely
Jeremiah
And
they
have
healed
the
hurt
the
daughter
people
slightly
saying
Peace
peace
when
there
peace
Jeremiah
Were
they
ashamed
when
they
had
committed
abomination
nay
they
were
not
all
ashamed
neither
could
they
blush
therefore
shall
they
fall
among
them
that
fall
the
time
their
visitation
they
shall
cast
down
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
will
utterly
consume
them
saith
Jehovah
there
shall
grapes
the
vine
nor
figs
the
fig
tree
and
the
leaf
shall
fade
and
the
things
that
have
given
them
shall
pass
away
from
them
Jeremiah
Why
sit
still
assemble
yourselves
and
let
enter
into
the
fortified
cities
and
let
silent
there
for
Jehovah
our
God
hath
put
silence
and
given
water
gall
drink
because
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
Jeremiah
looked
for
peace
but
good
came
and
for
time
healing
and
behold
dismay
Jeremiah
The
snorting
his
horses
heard
from
Dan
the
sound
the
neighing
his
strong
ones
the
whole
land
trembleth
for
they
are
come
and
have
devoured
the
land
and
all
that
the
city
and
those
that
dwell
therein
Jeremiah
For
behold
will
send
serpents
adders
among
you
which
will
not
charmed
and
they
shall
bite
you
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
that
could
comfort
myself
against

Jeremiah
Behold
the

daughter
people
from

Why
have
they
provoked
anger
with
their
graven
images
and
with
foreign
vanities
Jeremiah
The
harvest
past
the
summer
ended
and
are
not
saved
Jeremiah
For
the
hurt
the
daughter
people
hurt
mourn
dismay
hath
taken
hold
Jeremiah
there
balm
Gilead
there
physician
there
why
then
not
the
health
the

Jeremiah
that
head
were
waters
and
mine

that
might
weep
day
and
night
for
the
slain
the
daughter
people
Jeremiah
that
had
the
wilderness
lodging
place
wayfaring
men
that
might
leave
people
and
from
them
for
they
are
all
adulterers
assembly
treacherous
men
Jeremiah
And
they
bend
their
tongue
were
their
bow
for
falsehood
and
they
are
grown
strong
the
land
but
not
for
truth
for
they
proceed
from
evil
evil
and
they
know
not
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
Take
heed
every

his
neighbor
and
trust
not
any
brother
for
every
brother
will
utterly
supplant
and
every
neighbor
will

Jeremiah
And
they
will
deceive
every

his

and
will
not
speak
the
truth
they
have
taught
their
tongue
speak
lies
they
weary

Jeremiah
Thy

Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Behold
will
melt
them
and
try
them
for
how
else
should
because
the
daughter
people
Jeremiah
Their
tongue
deadly
arrow
speaketh
deceit
one
speaketh
peaceably
his
neighbor
with
his
mouth
but
his
heart
layeth
wait
for
him
Jeremiah
Shall
not
visit
them
for
these
things
saith
Jehovah
shall
not
soul
avenged
such
nation
this
Jeremiah
For
the
mountains
will
take
weeping
and
wailing
and
for
the
pastures
the
wilderness
lamentation
because
they
are
burned
that
none
passeth
through
neither
can
men
hear
the
voice
the
cattle
both
the
birds
the
heavens
and
the
beasts
are
fled
they
are
gone
Jeremiah
And
will
make
Jerusalem
heaps
dwelling
place
jackals
and
will
make
the
cities
Judah
desolation
without
inhabitant
Jeremiah
Who
the
wise
man
that
may
understand
this
and
who
whom
the
mouth
Jehovah
hath
spoken
that
may
declare
wherefore
the
land
perished
and
burned
like
wilderness
that
none
passeth
through
Jeremiah
And
Jehovah
saith
Because
they
have
forsaken
law
which
set
before
them
and
have
not
obeyed
voice
neither
walked
therein
Jeremiah
but
have
walked
after
the
stubbornness
their
own
heart
and
after
the
Baalim
which
their
fathers
taught
them
Jeremiah
therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
Behold
will
feed
them
even
this
people
with
wormwood
and
give
them
water
gall
drink
Jeremiah
will
scatter
them
also
among
the
nations
whom
neither
they
nor
their
fathers
have
known
and
will
send
the
sword
after
them
till
have
consumed
them
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Consider
and
call
for
the
mourning
women
that
they
may
come
and
send
for
the
skilful
women
that
they
may
come
Jeremiah
and
let
them
make
haste
and
take
wailing
for
that
our
eyes
may
run
down
with
tears
and
our
eyelids
gush
out
with
waters
Jeremiah
For
voice
wailing
heard
out
Zion
How
are
ruined
are
greatly
confounded
because
have
forsaken
the
land
because
they
have
cast
down
our
dwellings
Jeremiah
Yet
hear
the
word
Jehovah
women
and
let
your
ear
receive
the
word
his
mouth
and
teach
your
daughters
wailing
and
every
one
her
neighbor
lamentation
Jeremiah
For
death
come
into
our
windows
entered
into
our
palaces
cut
off
the
children
from
without
and
the
young
men
from
the

Jeremiah
Speak
Thus
saith
Jehovah
The
dead
bodies
men
shall
fall
dung
upon
the
open
field
and
the
handful
after
the
harvestman
and
none
shall
gather
them
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Let
not
the
wise
man
glory
his
wisdom
neither
let
the
mighty
man
glory
his
might
let
not
the
rich

knoweth
that
Jehovah
who
exerciseth
lovingkindness
justice
and

Jeremiah
Behold
the

Jehovah
that
will

Jeremiah
Hear
the

which
Jehovah
speaketh
unto

Jeremiah
thus
saith
Jehovah
Learn
not
the
way

nations
and
not
dismayed
the
signs

for
the

dismayed
them
Jeremiah
For
the
customs
the
peoples
are
vanity
for
one
cutteth
tree
out
the
forest
the
work

hands
the
workman
with
the
axe
Jeremiah
They
deck
with
silver
and
with
gold
they
fasten
with
nails
and
with
hammers
that
move
not
Jeremiah
They
are
like
palm

turned
work
and
speak
not
they
must

borne
because
they
cannot
not

for
they

Jeremiah
There

Jehovah
thou

Jeremiah
Who

forasmuch
among
all
the
wise

But
they
are

Jeremiah
There

artificer
and
the

Jeremiah
But
Jehovah
the
true
God
the
living
God
and
everlasting
King
his
wrath
the
earth
trembleth
and
the
nations
are
not
able

Jeremiah
Thus
shall
say
unto
them
The
gods
that
have
not
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
these
shall
perish
from
the
earth
and
from

Jeremiah
hath
made
the

his
power
hath
established
the

Jeremiah
When

Every

every
goldsmith
put
shame
his
graven
image
for
his
molten
image

Jeremiah
They

The

Gather

Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
will
sling
out
the

the
land
this
time
and
will
distress
them
that
they
may

Woe

they

Jeremiah
For
the
shepherds
are
become
brutish
and
have
not
inquired
Jehovah
therefore
they
have
not
prospered
and
all
their

are
scattered

The

Jeremiah
Jehovah
correct
but
measure
not
thine
anger
lest
thou
bring
nothing
Jeremiah
Pour
out
thy
wrath
upon
the
nations
that
know
thee
not
and
upon
the
families
that
call
not
thy
name
for
they
have
devoured
Jacob
yea
they
have
devoured
him
and
consumed
him
and
have
laid
waste
his
habitation
Jeremiah
The
word
that
came
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
saying
Jeremiah
Hear
the
words
this
covenant
and
speak
unto
the
men
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
and
say
thou
unto
them
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Cursed
the
man
that
heareth
not
the
words
this
covenant
Jeremiah
which
commanded
your
fathers
the
day
that
brought
them
forth
out
the
land
Egypt
out
the
iron
furnace
saying
Obey
voice
and
them
according
all
which
command
you
shall
people
and
will
your
God
Jeremiah
that
may
establish
the
oath
which
sware
unto
your
fathers
give
them
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
this
day
Then
answered
and
said
Amen
Jehovah
Jeremiah
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Proclaim
all
these
words
the
cities
Judah
and
the
streets
Jerusalem
saying
Hear
the
words
this
covenant
and
them
Jeremiah
For
earnestly
protested
unto
your
fathers
the
day
that
brought
them
out
the
land
Egypt
even
unto
this
day
rising
early
and
protesting
saying
Obey
voice
Jeremiah
Yet
they
obeyed
not
nor
inclined
their
ear
but
walked
every
one
the
stubbornness
their
evil
heart
therefore
brought
upon
them
all
the
words
this
covenant
which
commanded
them
but
they
did
them
not
Jeremiah
And
Jehovah
said
unto
conspiracy
found
among
the
men
Judah
and
among
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
They
are
turned
back
the
iniquities
their
forefathers
who
refused
hear
words
and
they
are
gone
after
other
gods
serve
them
the
house
Israel
and
the
house
Judah
have
broken
covenant
which
made
with
their
fathers
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
will
bring
evil
upon
them
which
they
shall
not
able
escape
and
they
shall
cry
unto
but
will
not
hearken
unto
them
Jeremiah
Then
shall
the
cities
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
and
cry
unto
the
gods
unto
which
they
offer
incense
but
they
will
not
save
them
all
the
time
their
trouble
Jeremiah
For
according
the
number
thy
cities
are
thy
gods
Judah
and
according
the
number
the
streets
Jerusalem
have
set
altars
the
shameful
thing
even
altars
burn
incense
unto
Baal
Jeremiah
Therefore
pray
not
thou
for
this
people
neither
lift
cry
nor
prayer
for
them
for
will
not
hear
them
the
time
that
they
cry
unto
because
their
trouble
Jeremiah
What
hath
beloved
house
seeing
she
hath
wrought
lewdness
with
many
and
the
holy
flesh
passed
from
thee
when
thou
doest
evil
then
thou
rejoicest
Jeremiah
Jehovah
called
thy
name
green
olive
tree
fair
with
goodly
fruit
with
the
noise
great
tumult
hath
kindled
fire
upon
and
the
branches
are
broken
Jeremiah
For
Jehovah
hosts
who
planted
thee
hath
pronounced
evil
against
thee
because
the
evil
the
house
Israel
and
the
house
Judah
which
they
have
wrought
for
themselves
provoking
anger
offering
incense
unto
Baal
Jeremiah
And
Jehovah
gave
knowledge
and
knew
then
thou
showedst
their
doings
Jeremiah
But
was
like
gentle
lamb
that
led
the
slaughter
and
knew
not
that
they
had
devised
devices
against
saying
Let
destroy
the
tree
with
the
fruit
thereof
and
let
cut
him
off
from
the
land
the
living
that
his
name
may
more
remembered
Jeremiah
But
Jehovah
hosts
who
judgest
righteously
who
triest
the
heart
and
the
mind
shall
see
thy
vengeance
them
for
unto
thee
have
revealed
cause
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
concerning
the
men
Anathoth
that
seek
thy
life
saying
Thou
shalt
not
prophesy
the
name
Jehovah
that
thou
die
not
our
hand
Jeremiah
therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Behold
will
punish
them
the
young
men
shall
die
the
sword
their
sons
and
their
daughters
shall
die
famine
Jeremiah
and
there
shall
remnant
unto
them
for
will
bring
evil
upon
the
men
Anathoth
even
the
year
their
visitation
Jeremiah
Righteous
art
thou
Jehovah
when
contend
with
thee
yet
would
reason
the
cause
with
thee
wherefore
doth
the
way
the
wicked
prosper
wherefore
are
all
they
ease
that
deal
very
treacherously
Jeremiah
Thou
hast
planted
them
yea
they
have
taken
root
they
grow
yea
they
bring
forth
fruit
thou
art
near
their
mouth
and
far
from
their
heart
Jeremiah
But
thou
Jehovah
knowest
thou
seest
and
triest
heart
toward
thee
pull
them
out
like
sheep
for
the
slaughter
and
prepare
them
for
the
day
slaughter
Jeremiah
How
long
shall
the
land
mourn
and
the
herbs
the
whole
country
wither
for
the
wickedness
them
that
dwell
therein
the
beasts
are
consumed
and
the
birds
because
they
said
shall
not
see
our
latter
end
Jeremiah
thou
hast
run
with
the
footmen
and
they
have
wearied
thee
then
how
canst
thou
contend
with
horses
and
though
land
peace
thou
art
secure
yet
how
wilt
thou
the
pride

Jordan
Jeremiah
For
even
thy
brethren
and
the
house
thy
father
even
they
have
dealt
treacherously
with
thee
even
they
have
cried
aloud
after

Many

Jeremiah
They

Destroyers

They

Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
against

evil
neighbors
that

Behold
will
pluck
them
from

Jeremiah
And

and
will
bring

And

But

Thus
saith
Jehovah

Jeremiah
bought

according
the
word
Jehovah
and
put

Jeremiah
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
the
second
time
saying
Jeremiah
Take

that
thou
hast
bought
which

Jeremiah
went
and
hid

Euphrates
Jehovah
commanded
Jeremiah
And
came

after
many
days
that
Jehovah
said
unto
Arise
the
Euphrates
and
take
the
girdle
from
thence
which
commanded
thee

there
Jeremiah
Then
went
the
Euphrates
and
digged
and
took
the
girdle
from
the
place
where
had
hid
and
behold
the
girdle
was
marred
was
profitable
for

Jeremiah
Then
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
After
this
manner
will
mar
the
pride
Judah
and
the
great

Jeremiah
This
evil
people
that

For

Jehovah
that
they

and
for
praise
and
for
glory
but
they
would
not
hear
Jeremiah
Therefore
thou
shalt
speak
unto
them
this
word
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Every
bottle
shall
filled
with
wine
and
they
shall
say
unto
thee
not
certainly
know
that
every

Jeremiah
Then
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
will
fill
all
the
inhabitants
this
land
even
the
kings
that
sit
upon
David
throne
and
the
priests
and
the

and
all
the

Jeremiah
And
will
dash
them

even
the

Jeremiah
Hear

Jeremiah
Give

Jehovah
your
God

and
before
your
feet
stumble
upon
the
dark
mountains
and
while

for
light
turn
into
the
shadow
death
and
make
gross
darkness
Jeremiah
But
will
not

weep
secret
for
your
pride
and
mine

shall
weep
sore
and
run
down
with

Say

Jeremiah
The

Jeremiah
Lift

Jeremiah
What

And

Wherefore

Jeremiah
Can

then
may

Jeremiah
Therefore
will
scatter

wilderness
Jeremiah
This

Jehovah
because
thou
hast
forgotten
and
trusted
falsehood
Jeremiah
Therefore
will
also
uncover
thy
skirts
upon
thy
face
and
thy
shame
shall
appear
Jeremiah
have
seen
thine
abominations
even
thine
adulteries
and
thy
neighings
the
lewdness
thy
whoredom
the
hills
the
field
Woe
unto
thee
Jerusalem
thou
wilt
not
made
clean
how
long
shall

Jeremiah
The
word
Jehovah
that
came
Jeremiah
concerning
the
drought
Jeremiah
Judah
mourneth
and
the
gates
thereof
languish
they
sit
black
upon
the
ground
and
the
cry
Jerusalem
gone
Jeremiah
And
their
nobles
send
their
little
ones
the
waters
they
come
the
cisterns
and
find
water
they
return
with
their
vessels
empty
they
are
put
shame
and
confounded
and
cover
their
heads
Jeremiah
Because
the
ground
which
cracked
for
that
rain
hath
been
the
land
the
plowmen
are
put
shame
they
cover
their
heads
Jeremiah
Yea
the
hind
also
the
field
calveth
and
forsaketh
her
young
because
there
grass
Jeremiah
And
the
wild
asses
stand
the
bare
heights
they
pant
for
air
like
jackals
their
eyes
fail
because
there
herbage
Jeremiah
Though
our
iniquities
testify
against
work
thou
for
thy
name
sake
Jehovah
for
our
backslidings
are
many
have
sinned
against
thee
Jeremiah
thou
hope
Israel
the
Saviour
thereof
the
time
trouble
why
shouldest
thou
sojourner
the
land
and
wayfaring
man
that
turneth
aside
tarry
for
night
Jeremiah
Why
shouldest
thou
man
affrighted
mighty
man
that
cannot
save
Yet
thou
Jehovah
art
the
midst
and
are
called
thy
name
leave
not
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
unto
this
people
Even
have
they
loved
wander
they
have
not
refrained
their
feet
therefore
Jehovah
doth
not
accept
them
now
will
remember
their
iniquity
and
visit
their
sins
Jeremiah
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Pray
not
for
this
people
for
their
good
Jeremiah
When
they
fast
will
not
hear
their
cry
and
when
they
offer
burnt
offering
and
meal
offering
will
not
accept
them
but
will
consume
them
the
sword
and
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
Jeremiah
Then
said
Lord
Jehovah
behold
the
prophets
say
unto
them
shall
not
see
the
sword
neither
shall
have
famine
but
will
give
you
assured
peace
this
place
Jeremiah
Then
Jehovah
said
unto
The
prophets
prophesy
lies
name
sent
them
not
neither
have
commanded
them
neither
spake
unto
them
they
prophesy
unto
you
lying
vision
and
divination
and
thing
nought
and
the
deceit
their
own
heart
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
concerning
the
prophets
that
prophesy
name
and
sent
them
not
yet
they
say
Sword
and
famine
shall
not
this
land
sword
and
famine
shall
those
prophets
consumed
Jeremiah
And
the
people
whom
they
prophesy
shall
cast
out
the
streets
Jerusalem
because
the
famine
and
the
sword
and
they
shall
have
none
bury
them
them
their
wives
nor
their
sons
nor
their
daughters
for
will
pour
their
wickedness
upon
them
Jeremiah
And
thou
shalt
say
this
word
unto
them
Let
mine
eyes
run
down
with
tears
night
and
day
and
let
them
not
cease
for
the
virgin
daughter
people
broken
with
great
breach
with
very
grievous
wound
Jeremiah
forth
into
the
field
then
behold
the
slain
with
the
sword
and
enter
into
the
city
then
behold
they
that
are
sick
with
famine
for
both
the
prophet
and
the
priest
about
the
land
and
have
knowledge
Jeremiah
Hast
thou
utterly
rejected
Judah
hath
thy
soul
loathed
Zion
why
hast
thou
smitten
and
there
healing
for
looked
for
peace
but
good
came
and
for
time
healing
and
behold
dismay
Jeremiah
acknowledge
Jehovah
our
wickedness
and
the
iniquity
our
fathers
for
have
sinned
against
thee
Jeremiah
not
abhor
for
thy
name
sake
not
disgrace
the
throne
thy
glory
remember
break
not
thy
covenant
with
Jeremiah
Are
there
any
among
the
vanities
the
nations
that
can
cause
rain

the
heavens
give
showers
art
not
thou
Jehovah
our
God
therefore
will
wait
for
thee
for
thou
hast
made
all
these
things
Jeremiah
Then
said
Jehovah
unto
Though
Moses
and
Samuel
stood
before
yet
mind
would
not
toward
this
people
cast
them
out
sight
and
let
them
forth
Jeremiah
And
shall
come
pass
when
they
say
unto
thee
Whither
shall
forth
then
thou
shalt
tell
them
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Such
are
for
death
death
and
such
are
for
the
sword
the

and
such
are
for
the
famine
the

and
such
are
for
captivity

Jeremiah
And
will
appoint
over
them
four
kinds
saith
Jehovah
the
sword
slay
and
the
dogs
tear
and
the
birds
the
heavens
and
the
beasts
the
earth
devour
and
destroy
Jeremiah
And
will
cause
them
tossed
and
fro
among
all
the
kingdoms
the
earth
because
Manasseh
the
son
Hezekiah
king
Judah
for
that
which
did
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
For
who
will
have
pity
upon
thee
Jerusalem
who
will
bemoan
thee
who
will
turn
aside
ask
thy
welfare
Jeremiah
Thou
hast
rejected
saith
Jehovah
thou
art
gone
backward
therefore
have
stretched
out
hand
against
thee
and
destroyed
thee
weary
with
repenting
Jeremiah
And
have
winnowed
them
with
fan
the
gates
the
land
have
bereaved
them
children
have
destroyed
people
they
returned
not
from
their
ways
Jeremiah
Their
widows
are
increased
above
the
sand
the
seas
have
brought
upon
them
against
the
mother
the
young
men
destroyer
noonday
have
caused
anguish
and
terrors
fall
upon
her
suddenly
Jeremiah
She
that

languisheth
she
hath
given
the
ghost
her
sun
gone
down
while
was
yet
day
she
hath
been
put

and
confounded
and
the
residue
them
will
deliver
the
sword
before
their
enemies
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
Woe
mother
that
thou
hast
borne
man
strife
and
man
contention
the
whole
earth
have
not
lent
neither
have
men
lent
yet
every
one
them
doth
curse
Jeremiah
Jehovah
said
Verily
will
strengthen
thee
for
good
verily
will
cause
the
enemy
make
supplication
unto
thee
the
time
evil
and
the
time
affliction
Jeremiah
Can
one
break
iron
even
iron
from
the
north
and
brass
Jeremiah
Thy
substance
and
thy
treasures
will
give
for
spoil
without
price
and
that
for
all
thy
sins
even
all
thy
borders
Jeremiah
And
will
make
them
pass
with
thine
enemies
into
land
which
thou
knowest
not
for
fire
kindled
mine
anger
which
shall
burn
upon
you
Jeremiah
Jehovah
thou
knowest
remember
and
visit
and
avenge
persecutors
take
not
away
thy
longsuffering
know
that
for
thy
sake
have
suffered
reproach
Jeremiah
Thy
words
were
found
and
did
eat
them
and
thy
words
were
unto
joy
and
the
rejoicing
heart
for
called
thy
name
Jehovah
God
hosts
Jeremiah
sat
not
the
assembly
them
that
make
merry
nor
rejoiced
sat
alone
because
thy
hand
for
thou
hast
filled
with
indignation
Jeremiah
Why
pain
perpetual
and
wound
incurable
which
refuseth
healed
wilt
thou
indeed
unto
deceitful
brook
waters
that
fail
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
thou
return
then
will
bring
thee
again
that
thou
mayest
stand
before
and
thou
take
forth
the
precious
from
the
vile
thou
shalt
mouth
they
shall
return
unto
thee
but
thou
shalt
not
return
unto
them
Jeremiah
And
will
make
thee
unto
this
people
fortified
brazen
wall
and
they
shall
fight
against
thee
but
they
shall
not
prevail
against
thee
for
with
thee
save
thee
and
deliver
thee
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
And
will
deliver
thee
out
the
hand
the
wicked
and
will
redeem
thee
out
the
hand
the
terrible
Jeremiah
The
word
Jehovah
came
also
unto
saying
Jeremiah
Thou
shalt
not
take
thee
wife
neither
shalt
thou
have
sons
daughters
this
place
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
concerning
the
sons
and
concerning
the
daughters
that
are
born
this
place
and
concerning
their
mothers
that
bare
them
and
concerning
their
fathers
that
begat
them
this
land
Jeremiah
They
shall
die
grievous
deaths
they
shall
not
lamented
neither
shall
they
buried
they
shall
dung
upon
the
face
the
ground
and
they
shall
consumed
the
sword
and
famine
and
their
dead
bodies
shall
food
for
the
birds
the
heavens
and
for
the
beasts
the
earth
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
Enter
not
into
the
house
mourning
neither
lament
neither
bemoan
them
for
have
taken
away
peace
from
this
people
saith
Jehovah
even
lovingkindness
and
tender
mercies
Jeremiah
Both
great
and
small
shall
die
this
land
they
shall
not
buried
neither
shall
men
lament
for
them
nor
cut
themselves
nor
make
themselves
bald
for
them
Jeremiah
neither
shall
men
break
bread
for
them
mourning
comfort
them
for
the
dead
neither
shall
men
give
them
the
cup
consolation
drink
for
their
father
for
their
mother
Jeremiah
And
thou
shalt
not
into
the
house
feasting
sit
with
them
eat
and
drink
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
Behold
will
cause
cease
out
this
place
before
your
eyes
and
your
days
the
voice
mirth
and
the
voice
gladness
the
voice
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
the
bride
Jeremiah
And
shall
come
pass
when
thou
shalt
show
this
people
all
these
words
and
they
shall
say
unto
thee
Wherefore
hath
Jehovah
pronounced
all
this
great
evil
against
what
our
iniquity
what
our
sin
that
have
committed
against
Jehovah
our
God
Jeremiah
then
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
Because
your
fathers
have
forsaken
saith
Jehovah
and
have
walked
after
other
gods
and
have
served
them
and
have
worshipped
them
and
have
forsaken
and
have
not
kept
law
Jeremiah
and
have
done
evil
more
than
your
fathers
for
behold
walk
every
one
after
the
stubbornness
his
evil
heart
that
hearken
not
unto
Jeremiah
therefore
will
cast
you
forth
out
this
land
into
the
land
that
have
not
known
neither
nor
your
fathers
and
there
shall
serve
other
gods
day
and
night
for
will
show
you
favor
Jeremiah
Therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
Jehovah
that
shall
more
said
Jehovah
liveth
that
brought
the
children
Israel
out
the
land
Egypt
Jeremiah
but
Jehovah
liveth
that
brought
the
children
Israel
from
the
land
the
north
and
from
all
the
countries
whither
had
driven
them
And
will
bring
them
again
into
their
land
that
gave
unto
their
fathers
Jeremiah
Behold
will
send
for
many
fishers
saith
Jehovah
and
they
shall
fish
them
and
afterward
will
send
for
many
hunters
and
they
shall
hunt
them
from
every
mountain
and
from
every
hill
and
out
the
clefts
the
rocks
Jeremiah
For
mine
eyes
are
upon
all
their
ways
they
are
not
hid
from
face
neither
their
iniquity
concealed
from
mine
eyes
Jeremiah
And
first
will
recompense
their
iniquity
and
their
sin
double
because
they
have
polluted
land
with
the
carcasses
their
detestable
things
and
have
filled
mine
inheritance
with
their
abominations
Jeremiah
Jehovah
strength
and
stronghold
and
refuge
the
day
affliction
unto
thee
shall
the
nations
come
from
the
ends
the
earth
and
shall
say
Our
fathers
have
inherited
nought
but
lies
even
vanity
and
things
wherein
there
profit
Jeremiah
Shall
man
make
unto
himself
gods
which
yet
are
gods
Jeremiah
Therefore
behold
will
cause
them
know
this
once
will
cause
them
know

and
they
shall
know
that
name

whilst

Jeremiah
And

Thus
saith
Jehovah
Cursed
the
man
that
trusteth

and
maketh
flesh

and
whose
heart
departeth

Jehovah
Jeremiah
For

places
the

Jeremiah
Blessed

For

But
they
hearkened
not
neither
inclined

made
their

might
not
hear

might
not

Jeremiah
And

The
word
which
came
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
saying
Jeremiah
Arise
and
down
the
potter
house
and
there

Jeremiah
Then
went
down
the

house
and
behold

Jeremiah
And
when
the

Jeremiah
that

Jeremiah
And

Jeremiah
they
that
which
evil
sight
that
they
obey

then
will
repent
the
good
wherewith

benefit
them
Jeremiah
Now
therefore
speak

saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold

Jeremiah
But

stubbornness
his
evil
heart
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
Ask
now
among
the
nations
who
hath
heard
such
things
the
virgin
Israel
hath
done
very
horrible
thing
Jeremiah
Shall
the
snow
Lebanon
fail
from
the
rock
the
field
shall
the
cold
waters
that
flow
down
from
afar
dried
Jeremiah
For
people
have
forgotten
they
have
burned
incense
false
gods
and
they
have
been
made
stumble
their
ways
the
ancient
paths
walk
bypaths
way
not
cast
Jeremiah
make
their
land
astonishment
and
perpetual
hissing
every
one
that
passeth
thereby
shall
astonished
and
shake
his
head
Jeremiah
will
scatter
them
with
east
wind
before
the
enemy
will
show
them
the
back
and
not
the
face
the
day
their
calamity
Jeremiah
Then
said
they
Come
and
let
devise
devices
against
Jeremiah
for
the
law
shall
not
perish
from
the
priest
nor
counsel
from
the
wise
nor
the
word
from
the
prophet
Come
and
let
smite
him
with
the
tongue
and
let
not
give
heed
any
his
words
Jeremiah
Give
heed
Jehovah
and
hearken
the
voice
them
that
contend
with
Jeremiah
Shall
evil
recompensed
for
good
for
they
have
digged
pit
for
soul
Remember
how
stood
before
thee
speak
good
for
them
turn
away
thy
wrath
from
them
Jeremiah
Therefore
deliver
their
children
the
famine
and
give
them
over
the
power
the
sword
and
let
their
wives
become
childless
and
widows
and
let
their
men
slain
death
and
their
young
men
smitten
the
sword
battle
Jeremiah
Let
cry
heard
from
their
houses
when
thou
shalt
bring
troop
suddenly
upon
them
for
they
have
digged
pit
take
and
hid
snares
for
feet
Jeremiah
Yet
Jehovah
thou
knowest
all
their
counsel
against
slay
forgive
not
their
iniquity
neither
blot
out
their
sin
from
thy
sight
but
let
them
overthrown
before
thee
deal
thou
with
them
the
time
thine
anger
Jeremiah
Thus
said
Jehovah
and
buy
potter
earthen
bottle
and
take
the
elders
the
people
and
the
elders
the
priests
Jeremiah
and
forth
unto
the
valley
the
son
Hinnom
which
the
entry
the
gate
Harsith
and
proclaim
there
the
words
that
shall
tell
thee
Jeremiah
and
say
Hear
the
word
Jehovah
kings
Judah
and
inhabitants
Jerusalem
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
Behold
will
bring
evil
upon
this
place
which
whosoever
heareth
his
ears
shall
tingle
Jeremiah
Because
they
have
forsaken
and
have
estranged
this
place
and
have
burned
incense
unto
other
gods
that
they
knew
not
they
and
their
fathers
and
the
kings
Judah
and
have
filled
this
place
with
the
blood
innocents
Jeremiah
and
have
built
the
high
places
Baal
burn
their
sons
the
fire
for
burnt
offerings
unto
Baal
which
commanded
not
nor
spake
neither
came
into
mind
Jeremiah
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
Jehovah
that
this
place
shall
more
called
Topheth
nor
The
valley
the
son
Hinnom
but
The
valley
Slaughter
Jeremiah
And
will
make
void
the
counsel
Judah
and
Jerusalem
this
place
and
will
cause
them
fall
the
sword
before
their
enemies
and
the
hand
them
that
seek
their
life
and
their
dead
bodies
will
give
food
for
the
birds
the
heavens
and
for
the
beasts
the
earth
Jeremiah
And
will
make
this
city
astonishment
and
hissing
every
one
that
passeth
thereby
shall
astonished
and
hiss
because
all
the
plagues
thereof
Jeremiah
And
will
cause
them
eat
the
flesh
their
sons
and
the
flesh
their
daughters
and
they
shall
eat
every
one
the
flesh
his
friend
the
siege
and
the
distress
wherewith
their
enemies
and
they
that
seek
their
life
shall
distress
them
Jeremiah
Then
shalt
thou
break
the
bottle
the
sight
the
men
that
with
thee
Jeremiah
and
shalt
say
unto
them
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Even
will
break
this
people
and
this
city
one
breaketh
potter
vessel
that
cannot
made
whole
again
and
they
shall
bury
Topheth
till
there
place
bury
Jeremiah
Thus
will
unto
this
place
saith
Jehovah
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
even
making
this
city
Topheth
Jeremiah
and
the
houses
Jerusalem
and
the
houses
the
kings
Judah
which
are
defiled
shall
the
place
Topheth
even
all
the
houses
upon
whose
roofs
they
have
burned
incense
unto
all
the
host
heaven
and
have
poured
out
drink
offerings
unto
other
gods
Jeremiah
Then
came
Jeremiah
from
Topheth
whither
Jehovah
had
sent
him
prophesy
and
stood
the
court
Jehovah
house
and
said
all
the
people
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
Behold
will
bring
upon
this
city
and
upon
all
its
towns
all
the
evil
that
have
pronounced
against
because
they
have
made
their
neck
stiff
that
they
may
not
hear
words
Jeremiah
Now
Pashhur
the
son
Immer
the
priest
who
was
chief
officer
the
house
Jehovah
heard
Jeremiah
prophesying
these
things
Jeremiah
Then
Pashhur
smote
Jeremiah
the
prophet
and
put
him
the
stocks
that
were
the
upper
gate
Benjamin
which
was
the
house
Jehovah
Jeremiah
And
came
pass
the
morrow
that
Pashhur
brought
forth
Jeremiah
out
the
stocks
Then
said
Jeremiah
unto
him
Jehovah
hath
not
called
thy
name
Pashhur
but
Magor
missabib
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
will
make
thee
terror
thyself
and
all
thy
friends
and
they
shall
fall
the
sword
their
enemies
and
thine
eyes
shall
behold
and
will
give
all
Judah
into
the
hand
the
king
Babylon
and
shall
carry
them
captive
Babylon
and
shall
slay
them
with
the
sword
Jeremiah
Moreover
will
give
all
the
riches
this
city
and
all
the
gains
thereof
and
all
the
precious
things
thereof
yea
all
the
treasures
the
kings
Judah
will
give
into
the
hand
their
enemies
and
they
shall
make
them
prey
and
take
them
and
carry
them
Babylon
Jeremiah
And
thou
Pashhur
and
all
that
dwell
thy
house
shall
into
captivity
and
thou
shalt
come
Babylon
and
there
thou
shalt
die
and
there
shalt
thou
buried
thou
and
all
thy
friends
whom
thou
hast
prophesied
falsely
Jeremiah
Jehovah
thou
hast
persuaded
and
was
persuaded
thou
art
stronger
than
and
hast
prevailed
become
laughing
stock
all
the
day
every
one
mocketh
Jeremiah
For
often
speak
cry
out
cry
Violence
and
destruction
because
the
word
Jehovah
made
reproach
unto
and
derision
all
the
day
Jeremiah
And
say
will
not
make
mention
him
nor
speak
any
more
his
name
then
there
heart
were
burning
fire
shut
bones
and
weary
with
forbearing
and
cannot
contain
Jeremiah
For
have
heard
the
defaming
many
terror
every
side
Denounce
and
will
denounce
him
say
all
familiar
friends
they
that
watch
for
fall
peradventure
will
persuaded
and
shall
prevail
against
him
and
shall
take
our
revenge
him
Jeremiah
But
Jehovah
with
mighty
one
and
terrible
therefore
persecutors
shall
stumble
and
they
shall
not
prevail
they
shall
utterly
put
shame
because
they
have
not
dealt
wisely
even
with
everlasting
dishonor
which
shall
never
forgotten
Jeremiah
But
Jehovah
hosts
that
triest
the
righteous
that
seest
the
heart
and
the
mind
let
see
thy
vengeance
them
for
unto
thee
have
revealed
cause
Jeremiah
Sing
unto
Jehovah
praise
Jehovah
for
hath
delivered
the
soul
the
needy
from
the
hand
evil
doers
Jeremiah
Cursed
the
day
wherein
was
born
let
not
the
day
wherein
mother
bare
blessed
Jeremiah
Cursed
the
man
who
brought
tidings
father
saying
man
child
born
unto
thee
making
him
very
glad
Jeremiah
And
let
that
man
the
cities
which
Jehovah
overthrew
and
repented
not
and
let
him
hear
cry
the
morning
and
shouting
noontime
Jeremiah
because
slew
not
from
the
womb
and
mother
would
have
been
grave
and
her
womb
always
great
Jeremiah
Wherefore
came
forth
out
the
womb
see
labor
and
sorrow
that
days
should
consumed
with
shame
Jeremiah
The
word
which
came
unto
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
when
king
Zedekiah
sent
unto
him
Pashhur
the
son
Malchijah
and
Zephaniah
the
son
Maaseiah
the
priest
saying
Jeremiah
Inquire
pray
thee
Jehovah
for
for
Nebuchadrezzar
king
Babylon
maketh
war
against
peradventure
Jehovah
will
deal
with
according
all
his
wondrous
works
that
may
from
Jeremiah
Then
said
Jeremiah
unto
them
Thus
shall
say
Zedekiah
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Behold
will
turn
back
the
weapons
war
that
are
your
hands
wherewith
fight
against
the
king
Babylon
and
against
the
Chaldeans
that
besiege
you
without
the
walls
and
will
gather
them
into
the
midst
this
city
Jeremiah
And
myself
will
fight
against
you
with
outstretched
hand
and
with
strong
arm
even
anger
and
wrath
and
great
indignation
Jeremiah
And
will
smite
the
inhabitants
this
city
both
man
and
beast
they
shall
die
great
pestilence
Jeremiah
And
afterward
saith
Jehovah
will
deliver
Zedekiah
king
Judah
and
his
servants
and
the
people
even
such
are
left
this
city
from
the
pestilence
from
the
sword
and
from
the
famine
into
the
hand
Nebuchadrezzar
king
Babylon
and
into
the
hand
their
enemies
and
into
the
hand
those
that
seek
their
life
and
shall
smite
them
with
the
edge
the
sword
shall
not
spare
them
neither
have
pity
nor
have
mercy
Jeremiah
And
unto
this
people
thou
shalt
say
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
set
before
you
the
way
life
and
the
way
death
Jeremiah
that
abideth
this
city
shall
die
the
sword
and
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
but
that
goeth
out
and
passeth
over
the
Chaldeans
that
besiege
you
shall
live
and
his
life
shall
unto
him
for
prey
Jeremiah
For
have
set
face
upon
this
city
for
evil
and
not
for
good
saith
Jehovah
shall
given
into
the
hand
the
king
Babylon
and
shall
burn
with
fire
Jeremiah
And
touching
the
house
the
king
Judah
hear
the
word
Jehovah
Jeremiah
house
David
thus
saith
Jehovah
Execute
justice
the
morning
and
deliver
him
that
robbed
out
the
hand
the
oppressor
lest
wrath
forth
like
fire
and
burn
that
none
can
quench
because
the
evil
your
doings
Jeremiah
Behold
against
thee
inhabitant
the
valley
and
the
rock
the
plain
saith
Jehovah
you
that
say
Who
shall
come
down
against
who
shall
enter
into
our
habitations
Jeremiah
And
will
punish
you
according
the
fruit
your
doings
saith
Jehovah
and
will
kindle
fire
her
forest
and
shall
devour
all
that
round
about
her
Jeremiah
Thus
said
Jehovah
down
the
house
the
king
Judah
and
speak
there
this
word
Jeremiah
And
say
Hear
the
word
Jehovah
king
Judah
that
sittest
upon
the
throne
David
thou
and
thy
servants
and
thy
people
that
enter
these
gates
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Execute
justice
and
righteousness
and
deliver
him
that
robbed
out
the
hand
the
oppressor
and
wrong
violence
the
sojourner
the
fatherless
nor
the
widow
neither
shed
innocent
blood
this
place
Jeremiah
For
this
thing
indeed
then
shall
there
enter
the
gates
this
house
kings
sitting
upon
the
throne
David
riding
chariots
and
horses
and
his
servants
and
his
people
Jeremiah
But
will
not
hear
these
words
swear
myself
saith
Jehovah
that
this
house
shall
become
desolation
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
concerning
the
house
the
king
Judah
Thou
art
Gilead
unto
and
the
head
Lebanon
yet
surely
will
make
thee
wilderness
and
cities
which
are
not
inhabited
Jeremiah
And
will
prepare
destroyers
against
thee
every
one
with
his
weapons
and
they
shall
cut
down
thy
choice
cedars
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
Jeremiah
And
many
nations
shall
pass
this
city
and
they
shall
say
every
man
his
neighbor
Wherefore
hath
Jehovah
done
thus
unto
this
great
city
Jeremiah
Then
they
shall
answer
Because
they
forsook
the
covenant
Jehovah
their
God
and
worshipped
other
gods
and
served
them
Jeremiah
Weep
not
for
the
dead
neither
bemoan
him
but
weep
sore
for
him
that
goeth
away
for
shall
return
more
nor
see
his
native
country
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
touching
Shallum
the
son
Josiah
king
Judah
who
reigned
instead
Josiah
his
father
and
who
went
forth
out
this
place
shall
not
return
thither
any
more
Jeremiah
but
the
place
whither
they
have
led
him
captive
there
shall
die
and
shall
see
this
land
more
Jeremiah
Woe
unto
him
that
buildeth
his
house
unrighteousness
and
his
chambers
injustice
that
useth
his
neighbor
service
without
wages
and
giveth
him
not
his
hire
Jeremiah
that
saith
will
build
wide
house
and
spacious
chambers
and
cutteth
him
out
windows
and
ceiled
with
cedar
and
painted
with
vermilion
Jeremiah
Shalt
thou
reign
because
thou
strivest
excel
cedar
Did
not
thy
father
eat
and
drink
and
justice
and
righteousness
then
was
well
with
him
Jeremiah
judged
the
cause
the
poor
and
needy
then
was
well
Was
not
this
know
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
But
thine
eyes
and
thy
heart
are
not
but
for
thy
covetousness
and
for
shedding
innocent
blood
and
for
oppression
and
for
violence
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
concerning
Jehoiakim
the
son
Josiah
king
Judah
they
shall
not
lament
for
him
saying
brother
sister
They
shall
not
lament
for
him
saying
lord
his
glory
Jeremiah
shall
buried
with
the
burial
ass
drawn
and
cast
forth
beyond
the
gates
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
Lebanon
and
cry
and
lift
thy
voice
Bashan
and
cry
from
Abarim
for
all
thy
lovers
are
destroyed
Jeremiah
spake
unto
thee
thy
prosperity
but
thou
saidst
will
not
hear
This
hath
been
thy
manner
from
thy
youth
that
thou
obeyedst
not
voice
Jeremiah
The
wind
shall
feed
all
thy
shepherds
and
thy
lovers
shall
into
captivity
surely
then
shalt
thou
ashamed
and
confounded
for
all
thy
wickedness
Jeremiah
inhabitant
Lebanon
that
makest
thy
nest
the
cedars
how
greatly
pitied
shalt
thou
when
pangs
come
upon
thee
the
pain

Jeremiah
live
saith
Jehovah
though
Coniah
the
son
Jehoiakim
king
Judah
were
the
signet
upon
right
hand
yet
would
pluck
thee
thence
Jeremiah
and
will
give
thee
into
the
hand
them
that
seek
thy
life
and
into
the
hand
them
whom
thou
art
afraid
even
into
the
hand
Nebuchadrezzar
king
Babylon
and
into
the
hand
the
Chaldeans
Jeremiah
And
will
cast
thee
out
and
thy
mother
that
bare
thee
into
another
country
where
were
not
born
and
there
shall
die
Jeremiah
But
the

shall
they
not
return
Jeremiah
this
man
Coniah
despised
broken

Jehovah
Write

Jeremiah
Woe
unto
the

Jehovah
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
against
the
shepherds

driven
them
away
and

out
all
the
countries

driven
them

bring
them
again

Jeremiah
And

set
shepherds
over
them

feed
them

Behold

Therefore

saith
Jehovah
that

more
say
Jehovah

And

Baal
and
caused
people
Israel

Jeremiah
the
prophets
Jerusalem
also
have
seen
horrible
thing
they
commit
adultery
and
walk
lies
and
they
strengthen
the
hands
evil
doers
that
none
doth
return
from
his
wickedness
they
are
all
them
become
unto
Sodom
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
Gomorrah
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
concerning
the
prophets
Behold
will
feed
them
with
wormwood
and
make
them
drink
the
water
gall
for

Jerusalem
ungodliness
gone
forth
into
all
the
land
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Hearken
not
unto
the
words
the
prophets
that
prophesy
unto
you
they
teach
you
vanity
they
speak

own
heart
and
not
out

mouth
Jehovah
Jeremiah
They
say
continually
unto
them
that
despise
Jehovah
hath
said
shall
have
peace
and
unto
every
one
that
walketh
the
stubbornness
his
own
heart
they
say
evil
shall
come
upon
you
Jeremiah
For
who
hath
stood
the
council
Jehovah
that
should
perceive
and
hear
his
word
who
hath
marked
word
and
heard
Jeremiah
Behold
the
tempest
Jehovah
even
his
wrath
gone
forth
yea
whirling
tempest
shall
burst
upon
the
head
the
wicked
Jeremiah
The
anger
Jehovah
shall
not
return
until
have
executed
and
till
have
performed
the
intents
his
heart
the
latter
days
shall
understand
perfectly
Jeremiah
sent
not
these
prophets
yet
they
ran
spake
not
unto
them
yet
they
prophesied
Jeremiah
But
they
had
stood
council
then
had
they
caused
people
hear
words
and
had
turned
them
from
their
evil
way
and
from
the
evil
their
doings
Jeremiah
God
hand
saith
Jehovah
and
not
God
afar
off
Jeremiah
Can
any
hide
himself
secret
places
that

not
see
him
saith
Jehovah
not
fill
heaven
and
earth
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
have
heard
what
the
prophets
have
said
that
prophesy
lies
name
saying
have
dreamed
have
dreamed
Jeremiah
How
long
shall
this
the
heart
the
prophets
that
prophesy
lies
even
the
prophets
the
deceit
their
own
heart
Jeremiah
that
think
cause
people
forget
name
their
dreams
which
they
tell
every
man
his
neighbor
their
fathers
forgat
name
for
Baal
Jeremiah
The
prophet
that
hath
dream
let
him
tell
dream
and
that
hath
word
let
him
speak
word
faithfully
What
the
straw
the
wheat
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
not
word
like
fire
saith
Jehovah
and
like
hammer
that
breaketh
the
rock
pieces
Jeremiah
Therefore
behold
against
the
prophets
saith
Jehovah
that
steal
words
every
one
from
his
neighbor
Jeremiah
Behold
against
the
prophets
saith
Jehovah
that
use
their
tongues
and
say
saith
Jeremiah
Behold
against
them
that
prophesy
lying
dreams
saith
Jehovah
and
tell
them
and
cause
people
err
their
lies
and
their
vain
boasting
yet
sent
them
not
nor
commanded
them
neither
they
profit
this
people
all
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
And
when
this
people
the
prophet
priest
shall
ask
thee
saying
What
the
burden
Jehovah
then
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
What
burden
will
cast
you
off
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
And
for
the
prophet
and
the
priest
and
the
people
that
shall
say
The
burden
Jehovah
will
even
punish
that
man
and
his
house
Jeremiah
Thus
shall
say
every
one
his
neighbor
and
every
one
his
brother
What
hath
Jehovah
answered
and
What
hath
Jehovah
spoken
Jeremiah
And
the
burden
Jehovah
shall
mention
more
for
every
man
own
word
shall
his
burden
for
have
perverted
the
words
the
living
God
Jehovah
hosts
our
God
Jeremiah
Thus
shalt
thou
say
the
prophet
What
hath
Jehovah
answered
thee
and
What
hath
Jehovah
spoken
Jeremiah
But
say
The
burden
Jehovah
therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
Because
say
this
word
The
burden
Jehovah
and
have
sent
unto
you
saying
shall
not
say
The
burden
Jehovah
Jeremiah
therefore
behold
will
utterly
forget
you
and
will
cast
you
off
and
the
city
that
gave
unto
you
and
your
fathers
away
from
presence
Jeremiah
and
will
bring
everlasting
reproach
upon
you
and
perpetual
shame
which
shall
not
forgotten
Jeremiah
Jehovah
showed
and
behold
two
baskets
figs
set
before
the
temple
Jehovah
after
that
Nebuchadrezzar
king
Babylon
had
carried
away
captive
Jeconiah
the
son
Jehoiakim
king
Judah
and
the
princes
Judah
with
the
craftsmen
and
smiths
from
Jerusalem
and
had
brought
them
Babylon
Jeremiah
One
basket
had
very
good
figs
like
the
figs
that
are
first
ripe
and
the
other
basket
had
very
bad
figs
which
could
not
eaten
they
were
bad
Jeremiah
Then
said
Jehovah
unto
What
seest
thou
Jeremiah
And
said
Figs
the
good
figs
very
good
and
the
bad
very
bad
that
cannot
eaten
they
are
bad
Jeremiah
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Like
these
good
figs
will
regard
the
captives
Judah
whom
have
sent
out
this
place
into
the
land
the
Chaldeans
for
good
Jeremiah
For
will
set
mine
eyes
upon
them
for
good
and
will
bring
them
again
this
land
and
will
build
them
and
not
pull
them
down
and
will
plant
them
and
not
pluck
them
Jeremiah
And
will
give
them
heart
know
that
Jehovah
and
they
shall
people
and
will
their
God
for
they
shall
return
unto
with
their
whole
heart
Jeremiah
And
the
bad
figs
which
cannot
eaten
they
are
bad
surely
thus
saith
Jehovah
will
give
Zedekiah
the
king
Judah
and
his
princes
and
the
residue
Jerusalem
that
remain
this
land
and
them
that
dwell
the
land
Egypt
Jeremiah
will
even
give
them
tossed
and
fro
among
all
the
kingdoms
the
earth
for
evil
reproach
and
proverb
taunt
and
curse
all
places
whither
shall
drive
them
Jeremiah
And
will
send
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
among
them
till
they
consumed
from
off
the
land
that
gave
unto
them
and
their
fathers
Jeremiah
The
word
that
came
Jeremiah
concerning
all
the
people
Judah
the
fourth
year
Jehoiakim
the
son
Josiah
king
Judah
the
same
was
the
first
year
Nebuchadrezzar
king
Babylon
Jeremiah
which
Jeremiah
the
prophet
spake
unto
all
the
people
Judah
and
all
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
saying
Jeremiah
From
the
thirteenth
year
Josiah
the
son
Amon
king
Judah
even
unto
this
day
these
three
and
twenty
years
the
word
Jehovah
hath
come
unto
and
have
spoken
unto
you
rising
early
and
speaking
but
have
not
hearkened
Jeremiah
And
Jehovah
hath
sent
unto
you
all
his
servants
the
prophets
rising
early
and
sending
them
but
have
not
hearkened
nor
inclined
your
ear
hear
Jeremiah
saying
Return
now
every
one
from
his
evil
way
and
from
the
evil
your
doings
and
dwell
the
land
that
Jehovah
hath
given
unto
you
and
your
fathers
from
old
and
even
for
evermore
Jeremiah
and
not
after
other
gods
serve
them
and
worship
them
and
provoke
not
anger
with
the
work
your
hands
and
will
you
hurt
Jeremiah
Yet
have
not
hearkened
unto
saith
Jehovah
that
may
provoke
anger
with
the
work
your
hands
your
own
hurt
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Because
have
not
heard
words
Jeremiah
behold
will
send
and
take
all
the
families
the
north
saith
Jehovah
and
will
send
unto
Nebuchadrezzar
the
king
Babylon
servant
and
will
bring
them
against
this
land
and
against
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
against
all
these
nations
round
about
and
will
utterly
destroy
them
and
make
them
astonishment
and
hissing
and
perpetual
desolations
Jeremiah
Moreover
will
take
from
them
the
voice
mirth
and
the
voice
gladness
the
voice
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
the
bride
the
sound
the
millstones
and
the
light

lamp
Jeremiah
And
this
whole
land
shall
desolation
and
astonishment
and
these
nations
shall
serve
the
king
Babylon
seventy
years
Jeremiah
And
shall
come
pass
when
seventy
years
are
accomplished
that
will
punish
the
king
Babylon
and
that
nation
saith
Jehovah
for
their
iniquity
and
the
land
the
Chaldeans
and
will
make
desolate
for
ever
Jeremiah
And
will
bring
upon
that
land
all
words
which
have
pronounced
against
even
all
that
written
this
book
which
Jeremiah
hath
prophesied
against
all
the
nations
Jeremiah
For
many
nations
and
great
kings
shall
make
bondmen
them
even
them
and
will
recompense
them
according
their
deeds
and
according
the
work

hands
Jeremiah
For

saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
unto
Take

Jeremiah
And

sword
that
will
send
among
them
Jeremiah
Then
took

Jehovah
had
sent
Jeremiah

And

Jeremiah
the
beginning
the
reign
Jehoiakim
the
son
Josiah
king
Judah
came
this
word
from
Jehovah
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Stand

speak
unto
all
the
cities
Judah

way
that

the
evil
which
purpose
unto

because
the
evil
their
doings
Jeremiah
And
thou
shalt
say
unto

Thus
saith
Jehovah
will

which

Jeremiah
hearken
the
words
servants
the
prophets
whom
send
unto
you
even
rising
early
and
sending
them
but
have
not
hearkened
Jeremiah
then
will
make
this
house
like
Shiloh
and
will
make
this
city
curse
all
the
nations
the
earth
Jeremiah
And
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
heard
Jeremiah
speaking
these
words
the
house
Jehovah
Jeremiah
And
came
pass
when
Jeremiah
had
made
end
speaking
all
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
him
speak
unto
all
the
people
that
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
laid
hold
him
saying
Thou
shalt
surely
die
Jeremiah
Why
hast
thou
prophesied
the
name
Jehovah
saying
This
house
shall
like
Shiloh
and
this
city
shall
desolate
without
inhabitant
And
all
the
people
were
gathered
unto
Jeremiah
the
house
Jehovah
Jeremiah
And
when
the
princes
Judah
heard
these
things
they
came
from
the
king
house
unto
the
house
Jehovah
and
they
sat
the
entry
the
new
gate
Jehovah
house
Jeremiah
Then
spake
the
priests
and
the
prophets
unto
the
princes
and
all
the
people
saying
This
man
worthy
death
for
hath
prophesied
against
this
city
have
heard
with
your
ears
Jeremiah
Then
spake
Jeremiah
unto
all
the
princes
and
all
the
people
saying
Jehovah
sent
prophesy
against
this
house
and
against
this
city
all
the
words
that
have
heard
Jeremiah
Now
therefore
amend
your
ways
and
your
doings
and
obey
the
voice
Jehovah
your
God
and
Jehovah
will
repent
him
the
evil
that
hath
pronounced
against
you
Jeremiah
But
for
behold
your
hand
with
good
and
right
your
eyes
Jeremiah
Only
know
for
certain
that
put
death
will
bring
innocent
blood
upon
yourselves
and
upon
this
city
and
upon
the
inhabitants
thereof
for
truth
Jehovah
hath
sent
unto
you
speak
all
these
words
your
ears
Jeremiah
Then
said
the
princes
and
all
the
people
unto
the
priests
and
the
prophets
This
man
not
worthy
death
for
hath
spoken
the
name
Jehovah
our
God
Jeremiah
Then
rose
certain
the
elders
the
land
and
spake
all
the
assembly
the
people
saying
Jeremiah
Micah
the
Morashtite
prophesied
the
days
Hezekiah
king
Judah
and
spake
all
the
people
Judah
saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Zion
shall
plowed
field
and
Jerusalem
shall
become
heaps
and
the
mountain
the
house
the
high
places
forest
Jeremiah
Did
Hezekiah
king
Judah
and
all
Judah
put
him
death
did
not
fear
Jehovah
and
entreat
the
favor
Jehovah
and
Jehovah
repented
him
the
evil
which
had
pronounced
against
them
Thus
should
commit
great
evil
against
our
own
souls
Jeremiah
And
there
was
also
man
that
prophesied
the
name
Jehovah
Uriah
the
son
Shemaiah
Kiriath
jearim
and
prophesied
against
this
city
and
against
this
land
according
all
the
words
Jeremiah
Jeremiah
And
when
Jehoiakim
the
king
with
all
his
mighty
men
and
all
the
princes
heard
his
words
the
king
sought
put
him
death
but
when
Uriah
heard
was
afraid
and
fled
and
went
into
Egypt
Jeremiah
And
Jehoiakim
the
king
sent
men
into
Egypt
namely
Elnathan
the
son
Achbor
and
certain
men
with
him
into
Egypt
Jeremiah
and
they
fetched
forth
Uriah
out
Egypt
and
brought
him
unto
Jehoiakim
the
king
who
slew
him
with
the
sword
and
cast
his
dead
body
into
the
graves
the
common
people
Jeremiah
But
the
hand
Ahikam
the
son
Shaphan
was
with
Jeremiah
that
they
should
not
give
him
into
the
hand
the
people
put
him
death
Jeremiah
the
beginning
the
reign
Jehoiakim
the
son
Josiah
king
Judah
came
this
word
unto
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Make
thee
bonds
and
bars
and
put
them
upon
thy
neck
Jeremiah
and
send
them
the
king
Edom
and
the
king
Moab
and
the
king
the
children
Ammon
and
the
king
Tyre
and
the
king
Sidon
the
hand
the
messengers
that
come
Jerusalem
unto
Zedekiah
king
Judah
Jeremiah
and
give
them
charge
unto
their
masters
saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
Thus
shall
say
unto
your
masters
Jeremiah
have
made
the
earth
the
men
and
the
beasts
that
are
upon
the
face
the
earth
great
power
and
outstretched
arm
and
give
unto
whom
seemeth
right
unto
Jeremiah
And
now
have
given
all
these
lands
into
the
hand
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
Babylon
servant
and
the
beasts
the
field
also
have
given
him
serve
him
Jeremiah
And
all
the
nations
shall
serve
him
and
his
son
and
his
son
son
until
the
time
his
own
land
come
and
then
many
nations
and
great
kings
shall
make
him
their
bondman
Jeremiah
And
shall
come
pass
that
the
nation
and
the
kingdom
which
will
not
serve
the
same
Nebuchadnezzar
king
Babylon
and
that
will
not
put
their
neck
under
the
yoke
the
king
Babylon
that
nation
will
punish
saith
Jehovah
with
the
sword
and
with
the
famine
and
with
the
pestilence
until
have
consumed
them
his
hand
Jeremiah
But
for
you
hearken
not
your
prophets
nor
your
diviners
nor
your
dreams
nor
your
soothsayers
nor
your
sorcerers
that
speak
unto
you
saying
shall
not
serve
the
king
Babylon
Jeremiah
for
they
prophesy
lie
unto
you
remove
you
far
from
your
land
and
that
should
drive
you
out
and
should
perish
Jeremiah
But
the
nation
that
shall
bring
their
neck
under
the
yoke
the
king
Babylon
and
serve
him
that
nation
will
let
remain
their
own
land
saith
Jehovah
and
they
shall
till
and
dwell
therein
Jeremiah
And
spake
Zedekiah
king
Judah
according
all
these
words
saying
Bring
your
necks
under
the
yoke
the
king
Babylon
and
serve
him
and
his
people
and
live
Jeremiah
Why
will
die
thou
and
thy
people
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
Jehovah
hath
spoken
concerning
the
nation
that
will
not
serve
the
king
Babylon
Jeremiah
And
hearken
not
unto
the
words
the
prophets
that
speak
unto
you
saying
shall
not
serve
the
king
Babylon
for
they
prophesy
lie
unto
you
Jeremiah
For
have
not
sent
them
saith
Jehovah
but
they
prophesy
falsely
name
that
may
drive
you
out
and
that
may
perish
and
the
prophets
that
prophesy
unto
you
Jeremiah
Also
spake
the
priests
and
all
this
people
saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Hearken
not
the
words
your
prophets
that
prophesy
unto
you
saying
Behold
the
vessels
Jehovah
house
shall
now
shortly
brought
again
from
Babylon
for
they
prophesy
lie
unto
you
Jeremiah
Hearken
not
unto
them
serve
the
king
Babylon
and
live
wherefore
should
this
city
become
desolation
Jeremiah
But
they
prophets
and
the
word
Jehovah
with
them
let
them
now
make
intercession
Jehovah
hosts
that
the
vessels
which
are
left
the
house
Jehovah
and
the
house
the
king
Judah
and
Jerusalem
not
Babylon
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
concerning
the
pillars
and
concerning
the
sea
and
concerning
the
bases
and
concerning
the
residue
the
vessels
that
are
left
this
city
Jeremiah
which
Nebuchadnezzar
king
Babylon
took
not
when
carried
away
captive
Jeconiah
the
son
Jehoiakim
king
Judah
from
Jerusalem
Babylon
and
all
the
nobles
Judah
and
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
yea
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
concerning
the
vessels
that
are
left
the
house
Jehovah
and
the
house
the
king
Judah
and
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
They
shall
carried
Babylon
and
there
shall
they
until
the
day
that
visit
them
saith
Jehovah
then
will
bring
them
and
restore
them
this
place
Jeremiah
And
came
pass
the
same
year
the
beginning
the
reign
Zedekiah
king
Judah
the
fourth
year
the
fifth
month
that
Hananiah
the
son
Azzur
the
prophet
who
was
Gibeon
spake
unto
the
house
Jehovah
the
presence
the
priests
and
all
the
people
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
speaketh
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
saying
have
broken
the
yoke
the
king
Babylon
Jeremiah
Within
two
full
years
will
bring
again
into
this
place
all
the
vessels
Jehovah
house
that
Nebuchadnezzar
king
Babylon
took
away
from
this
place
and
carried
Babylon
Jeremiah
and
will
bring
again
this
place
Jeconiah
the
son
Jehoiakim
king
Judah
with
all
the
captives
Judah
that
went
Babylon
saith
Jehovah
for
will
break
the
yoke
the
king
Babylon
Jeremiah
Then
the
prophet
Jeremiah
said
unto
the
prophet
Hananiah
the
presence
the
priests
and
the
presence
all
the
people
that
stood
the
house
Jehovah
Jeremiah
even
the
prophet
Jeremiah
said
Amen
Jehovah
Jehovah
perform
thy
words
which
thou
hast
prophesied
bring
again
the
vessels
Jehovah
house
and
all
them
the
captivity
from
Babylon
unto
this
place
Jeremiah
Nevertheless
hear
thou
now
this
word
that
speak
thine
ears
and
the
ears
all
the
people
Jeremiah
The
prophets
that
have
been
before
and
before
thee
old
prophesied
against
many
countries
and
against
great
kingdoms
war
and
evil
and
pestilence
Jeremiah
The
prophet
that
prophesieth
peace
when
the
word
the
prophet
shall
come
pass
then
shall
the
prophet
known
that
Jehovah
hath
truly
sent
him
Jeremiah
Then
Hananiah
the
prophet
took
the
bar
from
off
the
prophet
Jeremiah
neck
and
brake
Jeremiah
And
Hananiah
spake
the
presence
all
the
people
saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Even
will
break
the
yoke
Nebuchadnezzar
king
Babylon
within
two
full
years
from
off
the
neck
all
the
nations
And
the
prophet
Jeremiah
went
his
way
Jeremiah
Then
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
Jeremiah
after
that
Hananiah
the
prophet
had
broken
the
bar
from
off
the
neck
the
prophet
Jeremiah
saying
Jeremiah
and
tell
Hananiah
saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Thou
hast
broken
the
bars
wood
but
thou
hast
made
their
stead
bars
iron
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
have
put
yoke
iron
upon
the
neck
all
these
nations
that
they
may
serve
Nebuchadnezzar
king
Babylon
and
they
shall
serve
him
and
have
given
him
the
beasts
the
field
also
Jeremiah
Then
said
the
prophet
Jeremiah
unto
Hananiah
the
prophet
Hear
now
Hananiah
Jehovah
hath
not
sent
thee
but
thou
makest
this
people
trust
lie
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
will
send
thee
away
from
off
the
face
the
earth
this
year
thou
shalt
die
because
thou
hast
spoken
rebellion
against
Jehovah
Jeremiah
Hananiah
the
prophet
died
the
same
year
the
seventh
month
Jeremiah
Now
these
are
the
words
the
letter
that
Jeremiah
the
prophet
sent
from
Jerusalem
unto
the
residue
the
elders
the
captivity
and
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
whom
Nebuchadnezzar
had
carried
away
captive
from
Jerusalem
Babylon
Jeremiah
after
that
Jeconiah
the
king
and
the
queen
mother
and
the
eunuchs
and
the
princes
Judah
and
Jerusalem
and
the
craftsmen
and
the
smiths
were
departed
from
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
the
hand
Elasah
the
son
Shaphan
and
Gemariah
the
son
Hilkiah
whom
Zedekiah
king
Judah
sent
unto
Babylon
Nebuchadnezzar
king
Babylon
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
unto
all
the
captivity
whom
have
caused
carried
away
captive
from
Jerusalem
unto
Babylon
Jeremiah
Build
houses
and
dwell
them
and
plant
gardens
and
eat
the
fruit
them
Jeremiah
Take
wives
and
beget
sons
and
daughters
and
take
wives
for
your
sons
and
give
your
daughters
husbands
that
they
may
bear
sons
and
daughters
and
multiply
there
and
not
diminished
Jeremiah
And
seek
the
peace
the
city
whither
have
caused
you
carried
away
captive
and
pray
unto
Jehovah
for
for
the
peace
thereof
shall
have
peace
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
Let
not
your
prophets
that
are
the
midst
you
and
your
diviners
deceive
you
neither
hearken
your
dreams
which
cause
dreamed
Jeremiah
For
they
prophesy
falsely
unto
you
name
have
not
sent
them
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
After
seventy
years
are
accomplished
for
Babylon
will
visit
you
and
perform
good
word
toward
you
causing
you
return
this
place
Jeremiah
For
know
the
thoughts
that
think
toward
you
saith
Jehovah
thoughts
peace
and
not
evil
give
you
hope
your
latter
end
Jeremiah
And
shall
call
upon
and
shall
and
pray
unto
and
will
hearken
unto
you
Jeremiah
And
shall
seek
and
find
when
shall
search
for
with
all
your
heart
Jeremiah
And
will
found
you
saith
Jehovah
and
will
turn
again
your
captivity
and
will
gather
you
from
all
the
nations
and
from
all
the
places
whither
have
driven
you
saith
Jehovah
and
will
bring
you
again
unto
the
place
whence
caused
you
carried
away
captive
Jeremiah
Because
have
said
Jehovah
hath
raised
prophets
Babylon
Jeremiah
thus
saith
Jehovah
concerning
the
king
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne
David
and
concerning
all
the
people
that
dwell
this
city
your
brethren
that
are
not
gone
forth
with
you
into
captivity
Jeremiah
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Behold
will
send
upon
them
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
and
will
make
them
like
vile
figs
that
cannot
eaten
they
are
bad
Jeremiah
And
will
pursue
after
them
with
the
sword
with
the
famine
and
with
the
pestilence
and
will
deliver
them
tossed
and
fro
among
all
the
kingdoms
the
earth
execration
and
astonishment
and
hissing
and
reproach
among
all
the
nations
whither
have
driven
them
Jeremiah
because
they
have
not
hearkened
words
saith
Jehovah
wherewith
sent
unto
them
servants
the
prophets
rising
early
and
sending
them
but
would
not
hear
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
Hear
therefore
the
word
Jehovah
all
the
captivity
whom
have
sent
away
from
Jerusalem
Babylon
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
concerning
Ahab
the
son
Kolaiah
and
concerning
Zedekiah
the
son
Maaseiah
who
prophesy
lie
unto
you
name
Behold
will
deliver
them
into
the
hand
Nebuchadrezzar
king
Babylon
and
shall
slay
them
before
your
eyes
Jeremiah
and
them
shall
taken
curse
all
the
captives
Judah
that
are
Babylon
saying
Jehovah
make
thee
like
Zedekiah
and
like
Ahab
whom
the
king
Babylon
roasted
the
fire
Jeremiah
because
they
have
wrought
folly
Israel
and
have
committed
adultery
with
their
neighbors
wives
and
have
spoken
words
name
falsely
which
commanded
them
not
and
that
knoweth
and
witness
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
And
concerning
Shemaiah
the
Nehelamite
thou
shalt
speak
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
speaketh
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
saying
Because
thou
hast
sent
letters
thine
own
name
unto
all
the
people
that
are
Jerusalem
and
Zephaniah
the
son
Maaseiah
the
priest
and
all
the
priests
saying
Jeremiah
Jehovah
hath
made
thee
priest
the
stead
Jehoiada
the
priest
that
there
may
officers
the
house
Jehovah
for
every
man
that
mad
and
maketh
himself
prophet
that
thou
shouldest
put
him
the
stocks
and
shackles
Jeremiah
Now
therefore
why
hast
thou
not
rebuked
Jeremiah
Anathoth
who
maketh
himself
prophet
you
Jeremiah
forasmuch
hath
sent
unto
Babylon
saying
The
captivity
long
build
houses
and
dwell
them
and
plant
gardens
and
eat
the
fruit
them
Jeremiah
And
Zephaniah
the
priest
read
this
letter
the
ears
Jeremiah
the
prophet
Jeremiah
Then
came
the
word
Jehovah
unto
Jeremiah
saying
Jeremiah
Send
all
them
the
captivity
saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
concerning
Shemaiah
the
Nehelamite
Because
that
Shemaiah
hath
prophesied
unto
you
and
sent
him
not
and
hath
caused
you
trust
lie
Jeremiah
therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
will
punish
Shemaiah
the
Nehelamite
and
his
seed
shall
not
have
man
dwell
among
this
people
neither
shall
behold
the
good
that
will
unto
people
saith
Jehovah
because
hath
spoken
rebellion
against
Jehovah
Jeremiah
The
word
that
came
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
speaketh
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
saying
Write
thee
all
the
words
that
have
spoken
unto
thee
book
Jeremiah
For
the
days
come
saith
Jehovah
that
will
turn
again
the
captivity
people
Israel
and
Judah
saith
Jehovah
and
will
cause
them
return
the
land
that
gave
their
fathers
and
they
shall
possess
Jeremiah
And
these
are
the
words
that
Jehovah
spake
concerning
Israel
and
concerning
Judah
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
have
heard
voice
trembling
fear
and
not
peace
Jeremiah
Ask
now
and
see
whether
man
doth
travail
with
child
wherefore
see
every
man
with
his
hands
his
loins
woman
travail
and
all
faces
are
turned
into
paleness
Jeremiah
Alas
for
that
day
great
that
none
like
even
the
time
Jacob
trouble
but
shall
saved
out
Jeremiah
And
shall
come
pass
that
day
saith
Jehovah
hosts
that
will
break
his
yoke
from
off
thy
neck
and
will
burst
thy
bonds
and
strangers
shall
more
make
him
their
bondman
Jeremiah
but
they
shall
serve
Jehovah
their
God
and
David
their
king
whom
will
raise
unto
them
Jeremiah
Therefore
fear
thou
not
Jacob
servant
saith
Jehovah
neither
dismayed
Israel
for
will
save
thee
from
afar
and
thy
seed
from
the
land
their
captivity
and
Jacob
shall
return
and
shall
quiet
and
ease
and
none
shall
make
him
afraid
Jeremiah
For
with
thee
saith
Jehovah
save
thee
for
will
make
full
end
all
the
nations
whither
have
scattered
thee
but
will
not
make
full
end
thee
but
will
correct
thee
measure
and
will
wise
leave
thee
unpunished
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
Thy
hurt
incurable
and
thy
wound
grievous
Jeremiah
There
none
plead
thy
cause
that
thou
mayest
bound
thou
hast
healing
medicines
Jeremiah
All
thy
lovers
have
forgotten
thee
they
seek
thee
not
for
have
wounded
thee
with
the
wound
enemy
with
the
chastisement
cruel
one
for
the
greatness
thine
iniquity
because
thy
sins
were
increased
Jeremiah
Why
criest
thou
for
thy
hurt
thy
pain
incurable
for
the
greatness
thine
iniquity
because
thy
sins
were
increased
have
done
these
things
unto
thee
Jeremiah
Therefore
all
they
that
devour
thee
shall
devoured
and
all
thine
adversaries
every
one
them
shall
into
captivity
and
they
that
despoil
thee
shall
spoil
and
all
that
prey
upon
thee
will
give
for
prey
Jeremiah
For
will
restore
health
unto
thee
and
will
heal
thee
thy
wounds
saith
Jehovah
because
they
have
called
thee
outcast
saying
Zion
whom
man
seeketh
after
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
will
turn
again
the
captivity
Jacob
tents
and
have
compassion
his
dwelling
places
and
the
city
shall
builded
upon
its
own
hill
and
the
palace
shall
inhabited
after
its
own
manner
Jeremiah
And
out
them
shall
proceed
thanksgiving
and
the
voice
them
that
make
merry
and
will
multiply
them
and
they
shall
not
few
will
also
glorify
them
and
they
shall
not
small
Jeremiah
Their
children
also
shall
aforetime
and
their
congregation
shall
established
before
and
will
punish
all
that
oppress
them
Jeremiah
And
their
prince
shall
themselves
and
their
ruler
shall
proceed
from
the
midst
them
and
will
cause
him
draw
near
and
shall
approach
unto
for
who
that
hath
had
boldness
approach
unto
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
And
shall
people
and
will
your
God
Jeremiah
Behold
the
tempest
Jehovah
even
his
wrath
gone
forth
sweeping
tempest
shall
burst
upon
the
head
the
wicked
Jeremiah
The
fierce
anger
Jehovah
shall
not
return
until
have
executed
and
till
have
performed
the
intents
his
heart
the
latter
days
shall
understand
Jeremiah
that
time
saith
Jehovah
will
the
God
all
the
families
Israel
and
they
shall
people
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
The
people
that
were
left
the
sword
found
favor
the
wilderness
even
Israel
when
went
cause
him
rest
Jeremiah
Jehovah
appeared
old
unto
saying
Yea
have
loved
thee
with
everlasting
love
therefore
with
lovingkindness
have
drawn
thee
Jeremiah
Again
will
build
thee
and
thou
shalt
built
virgin
Israel
again
shalt
thou
adorned
with
thy
tabrets
and
shalt
forth
the
dances
them
that
make
merry
Jeremiah
Again
shalt
thou
plant
vineyards
upon
the
mountains
Samaria
the
planters
shall
plant
and
shall
enjoy
the
fruit
thereof
Jeremiah
For
there
shall
day
that
the
watchmen
upon
the
hills
Ephraim
shall
cry
Arise
and
let
Zion
unto
Jehovah
our
God
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
Sing
with
gladness
for
Jacob
and
shout
for
the
chief
the
nations
publish
praise
and
say
Jehovah
save
thy
people
the
remnant
Israel
Jeremiah
Behold
will
bring
them
from
the
north
country
and
gather
them
from
the
uttermost
parts
the
earth
and
with
them
the
blind
and
the
lame
the
woman
with
child
and
her
that
travaileth
with
child
together
great
company
shall
they
return
hither
Jeremiah
They
shall
come
with
weeping
and
with
supplications
will
lead
them
will
cause
them
walk
rivers
waters
straight
way
wherein
they
shall
not
stumble
for
father
Israel
and
Ephraim
first
born
Jeremiah
Hear
the
word
Jehovah

and
declare
the
isles
afar
off
and
say
that
scattered
Israel
will
gather
him
and
keep
him
shepherd
doth
his
flock
Jeremiah
For
Jehovah
hath
ransomed
Jacob
and
redeemed
him
from
the
hand
him
that
was
stronger
than
Jeremiah
And
they
shall
come
and
sing
the
height
Zion
and
shall
flow
unto

Then

for

Jeremiah
And

Thus
saith
Jehovah
Refrain

Jehovah
and
they

Thus

Yet

And

For

Upon

Jeremiah
those

they
shall

The

Jeremiah
But
every

every

that
eateth
the

Behold
the

saith
Jehovah
that
will

with
the
house
Israel
and
with

Jeremiah
not

covenant
that
made
with
their

the
day
that
took
them
the
hand
bring
them
out
the
land
Egypt
which
covenant
they
brake
although
was
husband
unto
them
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
But
this
the
covenant
that
will
make
with
the
house
Israel
after
those

saith
Jehovah
will
put

And

saying
Know
Jehovah
for
they
shall
all
know
from
the

them
unto
the
greatest
them
saith
Jehovah
for
will
forgive
their
iniquity
and
their
sin
will

Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
who
giveth
the
sun
for

day
and
the

the

and
the

who
stirreth

Jehovah
hosts
his

Jeremiah
these
ordinances
depart
from

saith
Jehovah
then
the
seed
Israel
also
shall
cease
from
being
nation
before
for
ever
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
heaven
above
can
measured
and
the
foundations
the
earth
searched
out
beneath
then
will
also
cast
off
all
the
seed
Israel
for
all
that
they
have
done
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
Behold
the
days
come
saith
Jehovah
that
the
city
shall
built
Jehovah
from
the
tower
Hananel
unto
the
gate
the

Jeremiah
And
the

And

The
word
that
came
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
the
tenth
year
Zedekiah
king
Judah
which
was
the
eighteenth
year
Nebuchadrezzar
Jeremiah
Now
that
time
the
king
Babylon
army
was
besieging
Jerusalem
and
Jeremiah
the
prophet
was
shut
the
court
the
guard
which
was
the
king
Judah
house
Jeremiah
For
Zedekiah
king
Judah
had
shut
him
saying
Wherefore
dost
thou
prophesy
and
say
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
the
king
Babylon
and
shall
take
Jeremiah
and
Zedekiah
king
Judah
shall
not
escape
out
the
hand
the
Chaldeans
but
shall
surely
delivered
into
the
hand
the
king
Babylon
and
shall
speak
with
him
mouth
mouth
and
his
eyes
shall
behold
his
eyes
Jeremiah
and
shall
bring
Zedekiah
Babylon
and
there
shall
until
visit
him
saith
Jehovah
though
fight
with
the
Chaldeans
shall
not
prosper
Jeremiah
And
Jeremiah
said
The
word
Jehovah
came
unto
saying
Jeremiah
Behold
Hanamel
the
son
Shallum
thine
uncle
shall
come
unto
thee
saying
Buy
thee
field
that
Anathoth
for
the
right
redemption
thine
buy
Jeremiah
Hanamel
mine
uncle
son
came
the
court
the
guard
according
the
word
Jehovah
and
said
unto
Buy
field
pray
thee
that
Anathoth
which
the
land
Benjamin
for
the
right
inheritance
thine
and
the
redemption
thine
buy
for
thyself
Then
knew
that
this
was
the
word
Jehovah
Jeremiah
And
bought
the
field
that
was
Anathoth
Hanamel
mine
uncle
son
and
weighed
him
the
money
even
seventeen
shekels
silver
Jeremiah
And
subscribed
the
deed
and
sealed
and
called
witnesses
and
weighed
him
the
money
the
balances
Jeremiah
took
the
deed
the
purchase
both
that
which
was
sealed
according
the
law
and
custom
and
that
which
was
open
Jeremiah
and
delivered
the
deed
the
purchase
unto
Baruch
the
son
Neriah
the
son
Mahseiah
the
presence
Hanamel
mine
uncle
son
and
the
presence
the
witnesses
that
subscribed
the
deed
the
purchase
before
all
the
Jews
that
sat
the
court
the
guard
Jeremiah
And
charged
Baruch
before
them
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
Take
these
deeds
this
deed
the
purchase
which
sealed
and
this
deed
which
open
and
put
them
earthen
vessel
that
they
may
continue
many
days
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
Houses
and
fields
and
vineyards
shall
yet
again
bought
this
land
Jeremiah
Now
after
had
delivered
the
deed
the
purchase
unto
Baruch
the
son
Neriah
prayed
unto
Jehovah
saying
Jeremiah
Lord
Jehovah
behold
thou
hast
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
thy
great
power
and
thine
outstretched
arm
there
nothing
too
hard
for
thee
Jeremiah
who
showest
lovingkindness
unto
thousands
and
recompensest
the
iniquity
the
fathers
into
the
bosom
their
children
after
them
the
great
the
mighty
God
Jehovah
hosts
his
name
Jeremiah
great
counsel
and
mighty
work
whose
eyes
are
open
upon
all
the
ways
the
sons
men
give
every
one
according
his
ways
and
according
the
fruit
his
doings
Jeremiah
who
didst
set
signs
and
wonders
the
land
Egypt
even
unto
this
day
both
Israel
and
among
other
men
and
madest
thee
name
this
day
Jeremiah
and
didst
bring
forth
thy
people
Israel
out
the
land
Egypt
with
signs
and
with
wonders
and
with
strong
hand
and
with
outstretched
arm
and
with
great
terror
Jeremiah
and
gavest
them
this
land
which
thou
didst
swear
their
fathers
give
them
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
Jeremiah
and
they
came
and
possessed
but
they
obeyed
not
thy
voice
neither
walked
thy
law
they
have
done
nothing
all
that
thou
commandedst
them
therefore
thou
hast
caused
all
this
evil
come
upon
them
Jeremiah
Behold
the
mounds
they
are
come
unto
the
city
take
and
the
city
given
into
the
hand
the
Chaldeans
that
fight
against
because
the
sword
and
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
and
what
thou
hast
spoken
come
pass
and
behold
thou
seest
Jeremiah
And
thou
hast
said
unto
Lord
Jehovah
Buy
thee
the
field
for
money
and
call
witnesses
whereas
the
city
given
into
the
hand
the
Chaldeans
Jeremiah
Then
came
the
word
Jehovah
unto
Jeremiah
saying
Jeremiah
Behold
Jehovah
the
God
all
flesh
there
anything
too
hard
for
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
the
Chaldeans
and
into
the
hand
Nebuchadrezzar
king
Babylon
and
shall
take
Jeremiah
and
the
Chaldeans
that
fight
against
this
city
shall
come
and
set
this
city
fire
and
burn
with
the
houses
upon
whose
roofs
they
have
offered
incense
unto
Baal
and
poured
out
drink
offerings
unto
other
gods
provoke
anger
Jeremiah
For
the
children
Israel
and
the
children
Judah
have
done
only
that
which
was
evil
sight
from
their
youth
for
the
children
Israel
have
only
provoked
anger
with
the
work
their
hands
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
For
this
city
hath
been
provocation
mine
anger
and
wrath
from
the
day
that
they
built
even
unto
this
day
that
should
remove
from
before
face
Jeremiah
because
all
the
evil
the
children
Israel
and
the
children
Judah
which
they
have
done
provoke
anger
they
their
kings
their
princes
their
priests
and
their
prophets
and
the
men
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
And
they
have
turned
unto
the
back
and
not
the
face
and
though
taught
them
rising
early
and
teaching
them
yet
they
have
not
hearkened
receive
instruction
Jeremiah
But
they
set
their
abominations
the
house
which
called
name
defile
Jeremiah
And
they
built
the
high
places
Baal
which
are
the
valley
the
son
Hinnom
cause
their
sons
and
their
daughters
pass
through
the
fire
unto
Molech
which
commanded
them
not
neither
came
into
mind
that
they
should
this
abomination
cause
Judah
sin
Jeremiah
And
now
therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
concerning
this
city
whereof
say
given
into
the
hand
the
king
Babylon
the
sword
and
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
Jeremiah
Behold
will
gather
them
out
all
the
countries
whither
have
driven
them
mine
anger
and
wrath
and
great
indignation
and
will
bring
them
again
unto
this
place
and
will
cause
them
dwell
safely
Jeremiah
And
they
shall
people
and
will
their
God
Jeremiah
and
will
give
them
one
heart
and
one
way
that
they
may
fear
for
ever
for
the
good
them
and
their
children
after
them
Jeremiah
and
will
make
everlasting
covenant
with
them
that
will
not
turn
away
from
following
them
them
good
and
will
put
fear
their
hearts
that
they
may
not
depart
from
Jeremiah
Yea
will
rejoice
over
them
them
good
and
will
plant
them
this
land
assuredly
with
whole
heart
and
with
whole
soul
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
Like
have
brought
all
this
great
evil
upon
this
people
will
bring
upon
them
all
the
good
that
have
promised
them
Jeremiah
And
fields
shall
bought
this
land
whereof
say
desolate
without
man
beast
given
into
the
hand
the
Chaldeans
Jeremiah
Men
shall
buy
fields
for
money
and
subscribe
the
deeds
and
seal
them
and
call
witnesses
the
land
Benjamin
and
the
places
about
Jerusalem
and
the
cities
Judah
and
the
cities
the
hill
country
and
the
cities
the
lowland
and
the
cities
the
South
for
will
cause
their
captivity
return
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
Moreover
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
Jeremiah
the
second
time
while
was
yet
shut
the
court
the
guard
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
that
doeth
Jehovah
that
formeth
establish
Jehovah
his
name
Jeremiah
Call
unto
and
will
answer
thee
and
will
show
thee
great
things
and
difficult
which
thou
knowest
not
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
concerning
the
houses
this
city
and
concerning
the
houses
the
kings
Judah
which
are
broken
down
make
defence
against
the
mounds
and
against
the
sword
Jeremiah
while
men
come
fight
with
the
Chaldeans
and
fill
them
with
the
dead
bodies
men
whom
have
slain
mine
anger
and
wrath
and
for
all
whose
wickedness
have
hid
face
from
this
city
Jeremiah
Behold
will
bring
health
and
cure
and
will
cure
them
and
will
reveal
unto
them
abundance
peace
and
truth
Jeremiah
And
will
cause
the
captivity
Judah
and
the
captivity
Israel
return
and
will
build
them
the
first
Jeremiah
And
will
cleanse
them
from
all
their
iniquity
whereby
they
have
sinned
against
and
will
pardon
all
their
iniquities
whereby
they
have
sinned
against
and
whereby
they
have
transgressed
against
Jeremiah
And
this
city
shall
for
name
joy
for
praise
and
for
glory
before
all
the
nations
the
earth
which
shall
hear
all
the
good
that
unto
them
and
shall
fear
and
tremble
for
all
the
good
and
for
all
the
peace
that
procure
unto
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Yet
again
there
shall
heard
this
place
whereof
say
waste
without
man
and
without
beast
even
the
cities
Judah
and
the
streets
Jerusalem
that
are
desolate
without
man
and
without
inhabitant
and
without

Jeremiah
the
voice
joy
and
the
voice
gladness
the
voice
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
the
bride
the
voice
them
that
say
Give
thanks
Jehovah
hosts
for
Jehovah
good
for
his
lovingkindness
endureth
for
ever
and
them
that
bring
sacrifices
thanksgiving
into
the
house
Jehovah
For
will
cause
the
captivity
the
land
return
the
first
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah

Yet
again
shall

this
place
which
waste
without

and
all
the

causing
their

down
Jeremiah
the

the
cities
the

and
the
cities
the
South
and
the
land
Benjamin
and
the
places
about
Jerusalem
and
the
cities
Judah
shall
the
flocks
again
pass
under
the
hands
him
that
numbereth
them
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
Behold
the
days
come
saith
Jehovah
that
will
perform
that
good
word
which
have
spoken
concerning
the
house
Israel
and
concerning
the
house
Judah
Jeremiah
those
days
and
that
time
will
cause
Branch
righteousness
grow
unto
David
and
shall
execute
justice
and
righteousness
the
land
Jeremiah
those
days
shall
Judah
saved
and
Jerusalem
shall
dwell
safely
and
this
the
name
whereby
she
shall
called
Jehovah
our
righteousness
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
David
shall
never
want
man
sit
upon
the
throne
the
house
Israel
Jeremiah
neither
shall
the
priests
the
Levites
want
man
before
offer
burnt
offerings
and
burn
meal
offerings
and
sacrifice
continually
Jeremiah
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
Jeremiah
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
can
break
covenant
the
day
and
covenant
the
night
that
there

not
day
and
night
their
season
Jeremiah
then
may
also
covenant
broken
with
David
servant
that
shall
not
have

reign
upon
his
throne
and
with
the
Levites
the
priests
ministers
Jeremiah
the
host
heaven
cannot
numbered
neither
the
sand
the
sea
measured
will
multiply
the
seed
David
servant
and
the
Levites
that
minister
unto
Jeremiah
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
Jeremiah
saying
Jeremiah
Considerest
thou
not
what
this
people
have
spoken
saying
The
two
families
which
Jehovah
did
choose
hath
cast
them
off
thus
they
despise
people
that
they
should
more
nation
before
them
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
covenant
day
and
night
stand
not
have
not
appointed
the
ordinances
heaven
and

Jeremiah
then
will
also
cast
away
the
seed
Jacob
and
David
servant
that
will
not
take
his
seed
rulers
over
the
seed
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
for
will
cause
their
captivity
return
and
will
have
mercy
them
Jeremiah
The
word
which
came
unto
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
when
Nebuchadnezzar
king
Babylon
and
all
his
army
and
all
the
kingdoms
the
earth
that
were
under
his
dominion
and
all
the
peoples
were
fighting
against
Jerusalem
and
against
all
the
cities
thereof
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
and
speak
Zedekiah
king
Judah
and
tell
him
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
the
king
Babylon
and
shall
burn
with
fire
Jeremiah
and
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
his
hand
but
shalt
surely
taken
and
delivered
into
his
hand
and
thine
eyes
shall
behold
the
eyes
the
king
Babylon
and
shall
speak
with
thee
mouth
mouth
and
thou
shalt
Babylon
Jeremiah
Yet
hear
the
word
Jehovah
Zedekiah
king
Judah
thus
saith
Jehovah
concerning
thee
Thou
shalt
not
die
the
sword
Jeremiah
thou
shalt
die
peace
and
with
the
burnings
thy
fathers
the
former
kings
that
were
before
thee
shall
they
make
burning
for
thee
and
they
shall
lament
thee
saying
Lord
for
have
spoken
the
word
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
Then
Jeremiah
the
prophet
spake
all
these
words
unto
Zedekiah
king
Judah
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
when
the
king
Babylon
army
was
fighting
against
Jerusalem
and
against
all
the
cities
Judah
that
were
left
against
Lachish
and
against

for
these

remained

cities
Judah
fortified
cities
Jeremiah
The
word
that

from

And

afterwards

caused
the
servants
and
the
handmaids
whom
they
had
let
free

and
brought
them
into
subjection
for

and

Jeremiah
Therefore
the
word
Jehovah
came
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah

and

served
thee
six
years
thou
shalt
let
him
free
from
thee
but
your
fathers
hearkened
not
unto
neither
inclined
their
ear
Jeremiah
And
were
now
turned
and
had
done
that
which
right

proclaiming
liberty
every
man
his
neighbor
and
had
made
covenant
before

but

and
caused
every
man
his
servant
and
every
man
his
handmaid
whom
had
let
free
their
pleasure
return
and
brought
them
into

unto
you
for
servants
and
for
handmaids
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
have
not
hearkened
unto
proclaim
liberty
every
man
his
brother
and
every
man
his
neighbor
behold
proclaim
unto
you

saith
Jehovah
the
sword
the
pestilence
and
the
famine
and
will
make
you
tossed
and
fro
among
all
the
kingdoms
the
earth
Jeremiah
And
will
give
the
men
that
have
transgressed
covenant
that
have
not
performed
the
words
the
covenant
which
they
made
before
when
they
cut
the
calf
twain
and
passed
between
the
parts
thereof
Jeremiah
the
princes
Judah
and
the
princes
Jerusalem
the
eunuchs
and
the
priests
and
all
the
people
the
land
that
passed
between
the
parts

Jeremiah
will
even
give
them
into
the
hand
their
enemies
and
into
the
hand
them
that
seek
their
life
and
their
dead
bodies
shall

food
unto
the
birds
the
heavens
and
the
beasts
the
earth
Jeremiah
And
Zedekiah
king
Judah
and
his
princes
will
give
into
the
hand
their
enemies
and
into
the
hand
them
that
seek
their
life
and
into
the
hand
the
king
Babylon
army
that
are
gone
away
from
you
Jeremiah
Behold
will
command
saith
Jehovah
and
cause
them
return
this
city
and
they
shall
fight
against
and
take
and
burn
with
fire
and
will
make
the
cities
Judah
desolation
without
inhabitant
Jeremiah
The
word
which
came
unto
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
the
days
Jehoiakim
the
son
Josiah
king
Judah
saying
Jeremiah
unto
the
house
the
Rechabites
and
speak
unto
them
and
bring
them
into
the
house
Jehovah
into
one
the
chambers
and
give
them
wine
drink
Jeremiah
Then
took
Jaazaniah
the
son
Jeremiah
the
son
Habazziniah
and
his
brethren
and
all
his
sons
and
the
whole
house
the
Rechabites
Jeremiah
and
brought
them
into
the
house
Jehovah
into
the
chamber
the
sons
Hanan
the
son
Igdaliah
the
man
God
which
was
the
chamber
the
princes
which
was
above
the
chamber
Maaseiah
the
son
Shallum
the
keeper
the
threshold
Jeremiah
And
set
before
the
sons
the
house
the
Rechabites
bowls
full
wine
and
cups
and
said
unto
them
Drink
wine
Jeremiah
But
they
said
will
drink
wine
for
Jonadab
the
son
Rechab
our
father
commanded
saying
shall
drink
wine
neither
nor
your
sons
for
ever
Jeremiah
neither
shall
build
house
nor
sow
seed
nor
plant
vineyard
nor
have
any
but
all
your
days
shall
dwell
tents
that
may
live
many
days
the
land
wherein
sojourn
Jeremiah
And
have
obeyed
the
voice
Jonadab
the
son
Rechab
our
father
all
that
charged
drink
wine
all
our
days
our
wives
our
sons
our
daughters
Jeremiah
nor
build
houses
for
dwell
neither
have
vineyard
nor
field
nor
seed
Jeremiah
but
have
dwelt
tents
and
have
obeyed
and
done
according
all
that
Jonadab
our
father
commanded
Jeremiah
But
came
pass
when
Nebuchadrezzar
king
Babylon
came
into
the
land
that
said
Come
and
let
Jerusalem
for
fear
the
army
the
Chaldeans
and
for
fear
the
army
the
Syrians
dwell
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
Then
came
the
word
Jehovah
unto
Jeremiah
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
and
say
the
men
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
Will
not
receive
instruction
hearken
words
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
The
words
Jonadab
the
son
Rechab
that
commanded
his
sons
not
drink
wine
are
performed
and
unto
this
day
they
drink
none
for
they
obey
their
father
commandment
But
have
spoken
unto
you
rising
early
and
speaking
and
have
not
hearkened
unto
Jeremiah
have
sent
also
unto
you
all
servants
the
prophets
rising
early
and
sending
them
saying
Return
now
every
man
from
his
evil
way
and
amend
your
doings
and
not
after
other
gods
serve
them
and
shall
dwell
the
land
which
have
given
you
and
your
fathers
but
have
not
inclined
your
ear
nor
hearkened
unto
Jeremiah
Forasmuch
the
sons
Jonadab
the
son
Rechab
have
performed
the
commandment
their
father
which
commanded
them
but
this
people
hath
not
hearkened
unto
Jeremiah
therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
hosts
the
God
Israel
Behold
will
bring
upon
Judah
and
upon
all
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
all
the
evil
that
have
pronounced
against
them
because
have
spoken
unto
them
but
they
have
not
heard
and
have
called
unto
them
but
they
have
not
answered
Jeremiah
And
Jeremiah
said
unto
the
house
the
Rechabites
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
Because
have
obeyed
the
commandment
Jonadab
your
father
and
kept
all
his
precepts
and
done
according
unto
all
that
commanded
you
Jeremiah
therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
Jonadab
the
son
Rechab
shall
not
want
man
stand
before
for
ever
Jeremiah
And
came
pass
the
fourth
year
Jehoiakim
the
son
Josiah
king
Judah
that
this
word
came
unto
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
saying
Jeremiah
Take
thee
roll
book
and
write
therein
all
the
words
that
have
spoken
unto
thee
against
Israel
and
against
Judah
and
against
all
the
nations
from
the
day
spake
unto
thee
from
the
days
Josiah
even
unto
this
day
Jeremiah
may
that
the
house
Judah
will
hear
all
the
evil
which
purpose
unto
them
that
they
may
return
every
man
from
his
evil
way
that
may
forgive
their
iniquity
and
their
sin
Jeremiah
Then
Jeremiah
called
Baruch
the
son
Neriah
and
Baruch
wrote
from
the
mouth
Jeremiah
all
the
words
Jehovah
which
had
spoken
unto
him
upon
roll
book
Jeremiah
And
Jeremiah
commanded
Baruch
saying
shut
cannot
into
the
house
Jehovah
Jeremiah
therefore
thou
and
read
the
roll
which
thou
hast
written
from
mouth
the
words
Jehovah
the
ears
the
people
Jehovah
house
upon
the
fast
day
and
also
thou
shalt
read
them
the
ears
all
Judah
that
come
out
their
cities
Jeremiah
may
they
will
present
their
supplication
before
Jehovah
and
will
return
every
one
from
his
evil
way
for
great
the
anger
and
the
wrath
that
Jehovah
hath
pronounced
against
this
people
Jeremiah
And
Baruch
the
son
Neriah
did
according
all
that
Jeremiah
the
prophet
commanded
him
reading
the
book
the
words
Jehovah
Jehovah
house
Jeremiah
Now
came
pass
the
fifth
year
Jehoiakim
the
son
Josiah
king
Judah
the
ninth
month
that
all
the
people
Jerusalem
and
all
the
people
that
came
from
the
cities
Judah
unto
Jerusalem
proclaimed
fast
before
Jehovah
Jeremiah
Then
read
Baruch
the
book
the
words
Jeremiah
the
house
Jehovah
the
chamber
Gemariah
the
son
Shaphan
the
scribe
the
upper
court
the
entry
the
new
gate
Jehovah
house
the
ears
all
the
people
Jeremiah
And
when
Micaiah
the
son
Gemariah
the
son
Shaphan
had
heard
out
the
book
all
the
words
Jehovah
Jeremiah
went
down
into
the
king
house
into
the
scribe
chamber
and
all
the
princes
were
sitting
there
wit
Elishama
the
scribe
and
Delaiah
the
son
Shemaiah
and
Elnathan
the
son
Achbor
and
Gemariah
the
son
Shaphan
and
Zedekiah
the
son
Hananiah
and
all
the
princes
Jeremiah
Then
Micaiah
declared
unto
them
all
the
words
that
had
heard
when
Baruch
read
the
book
the
ears
the
people
Jeremiah
Therefore
all
the
princes
sent
Jehudi
the
son
Nethaniah
the
son
Shelemiah
the
son
Cushi
unto
Baruch
saying
Take
thy
hand
the
roll
wherein
thou
hast
read
the
ears
the
people
and
come
Baruch
the
son
Neriah
took
the
roll
his
hand
and
came
unto
them
Jeremiah
And
they
said
unto
him
Sit
down
now
and
read
our
ears
Baruch
read
their
ears
Jeremiah
Now
came
pass
when
they
had
heard
all
the
words
they
turned
fear
one
toward
another
and
said
unto
Baruch
will
surely
tell
the
king
all
these
words
Jeremiah
And
they
asked
Baruch
saying
Tell
now
How
didst
thou
write
all
these
words
his
mouth
Jeremiah
Then
Baruch
answered
them
pronounced
all
these
words
unto
with
his
mouth
and
wrote
them
with
ink
the
book
Jeremiah
Then
said
the
princes
unto
Baruch
hide
thee
thou
and
Jeremiah
and
let
man
know
where
are
Jeremiah
And
they
went
the
king
into
the
court
but
they
had
laid
the
roll
the
chamber
Elishama
the
scribe
and
they
told
all
the
words
the
ears
the
king
Jeremiah
the
king
sent
Jehudi
fetch
the
roll
and
took
out
the
chamber
Elishama
the
scribe
And
Jehudi
read
the
ears
the
king
and
the
ears
all
the
princes
that
stood
beside
the
king
Jeremiah
Now
the
king
was
sitting
the
winter
house
the
ninth
month
and
there
was
fire
the
brazier
burning
before
him
Jeremiah
And
came
pass
when
Jehudi
had
read
three
four
leaves
that
the
king
cut
with
the
penknife
and
cast
into
the
fire
that
was
the
brazier
until
all
the
roll
was
consumed
the
fire
that
was
the
brazier
Jeremiah
And
they
were
not
afraid
nor
rent
their
garments
neither
the
king
nor
any
his
servants
that
heard
all
these
words
Jeremiah
Moreover
Elnathan
and
Delaiah
and
Gemariah
had
made
intercession
the
king
that
would
not
burn
the
roll
but
would
not
hear
them
Jeremiah
And
the
king
commanded
Jerahmeel
the
king
son
and
Seraiah
the
son
Azriel
and
Shelemiah
the
son
Abdeel
take
Baruch
the
scribe
and
Jeremiah
the
prophet
but
Jehovah
hid
them
Jeremiah
Then
the
word
Jehovah
came
Jeremiah
after
that
the
king
had
burned
the
roll
and
the
words
which
Baruch
wrote
the
mouth
Jeremiah
saying
Jeremiah
Take
thee
again
another
roll
and
write
all
the
former
words
that
were
the
first
roll
which
Jehoiakim
the
king
Judah
hath
burned
Jeremiah
And
concerning
Jehoiakim
king
Judah
thou
shalt
say
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Thou
hast
burned
this
roll
saying
Why
hast
thou
written
therein
saying
The
king
Babylon
shall
certainly
come
and
destroy
this
land
and
shall
cause
cease
from
thence
man
and
beast
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
concerning
Jehoiakim
king
Judah
shall
have
none
sit
upon
the
throne
David
and
his
dead
body
shall
cast
out
the
day
the
heat
and
the
night
the
frost
Jeremiah
And
will
punish
him
and
his
seed
and
his
servants
for
their
iniquity
and
will
bring
upon
them
and
upon
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
and
upon
the
men
Judah
all
the
evil
that
have
pronounced
against
them
but
they
hearkened
not
Jeremiah
Then
took
Jeremiah
another
roll
and
gave
Baruch
the
scribe
the
son
Neriah
who
wrote
therein
from
the
mouth
Jeremiah
all
the
words
the
book
which
Jehoiakim
king
Judah
had
burned
the
fire
and
there
were
added
besides
unto
them
many
like
words
Jeremiah
And
Zedekiah
the
son
Josiah
reigned
king
instead
Coniah
the
son
Jehoiakim
whom
Nebuchadrezzar
king
Babylon
made
king
the
land
Judah
Jeremiah
But
neither
nor
his
servants
nor
the
people
the
land
did
hearken
unto
the
words
Jehovah
which
spake
the
prophet
Jeremiah
Jeremiah
And
Zedekiah
the
king
sent
Jehucal
the
son
Shelemiah
and
Zephaniah
the
son
Maaseiah
the
priest
the
prophet
Jeremiah
saying
Pray
now
unto
Jehovah
our
God
for
Jeremiah
Now
Jeremiah
came
and
went
out
among
the
people
for
they
had
not
put
him
into
prison
Jeremiah
And
Pharaoh
army
was
come
forth
out
Egypt
and
when
the
Chaldeans
that
were
besieging
Jerusalem
heard
tidings
them
they
brake
from
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
Then
came
the
word
Jehovah
unto
the
prophet
Jeremiah
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
Thus
shall
say
the
king
Judah
that
sent
you
unto
inquire
Behold
Pharaoh
army
which
come
forth
help
you
shall
return
Egypt
into
their
own
land
Jeremiah
And
the
Chaldeans
shall
come
again
and
fight
against
this
city
and
they
shall
take
and
burn
with
fire
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Deceive
not
yourselves
saying
The
Chaldeans
shall
surely
depart
from
for
they
shall
not
depart
Jeremiah
For
though
had
smitten
the
whole
army
the
Chaldeans
that
fight
against
you
and
there
remained
but
wounded
men
among
them
yet
would
they
rise
every
man
his
tent
and
burn
this
city
with
fire
Jeremiah
And
came
pass
that
when
the
army
the
Chaldeans
was
broken
from
Jerusalem
for
fear
Pharaoh
army
Jeremiah
then
Jeremiah
went
forth
out
Jerusalem
into
the
land
Benjamin
receive
his
portion
there
the
midst
the
people
Jeremiah
And
when
was
the
gate
Benjamin
captain
the
ward
was
there
whose
name
was
Irijah
the
son
Shelemiah
the
son
Hananiah
and
laid
hold
Jeremiah
the
prophet
saying
Thou
art
falling
away
the
Chaldeans
Jeremiah
Then
said
Jeremiah
false
not
falling
away
the
Chaldeans
But
hearkened
not
him
Irijah
laid
hold
Jeremiah
and
brought
him
the
princes
Jeremiah
And
the
princes
were
wroth
with
Jeremiah
and
smote
him
and
put
him
prison
the
house
Jonathan
the
scribe
for
they
had
made
that
the
prison
Jeremiah
When
Jeremiah
was
come
into
the
dungeon
house
and
into
the
cells
and
Jeremiah
had
remained
there
many
days
Jeremiah
then
Zedekiah
the
king
sent
and
fetched
him
and
the
king
asked
him
secretly
his
house
and
said
there
any
word
from
Jehovah
And
Jeremiah
said
There
said
also
Thou
shalt
delivered
into
the
hand
the
king
Babylon
Jeremiah
Moreover
Jeremiah
said
unto
king
Zedekiah
Wherein
have
sinned
against
thee
against
thy
servants
against
this
people
that
have
put
prison
Jeremiah
Where
now
are
your
prophets
that
prophesied
unto
you
saying
The
king
Babylon
shall
not
come
against
you
nor
against
this
land
Jeremiah
And
now
hear
pray
thee
lord
the
king
let
supplication
pray
thee
presented
before
thee
that
thou
cause
not
return
the
house
Jonathan
the
scribe
lest
die
there
Jeremiah
Then
Zedekiah
the
king
commanded
and
they
committed
Jeremiah
into
the
court
the
guard
and
they
gave
him
daily
loaf
bread
out
the
bakers
street
until
all
the
bread
the
city
was
spent
Thus
Jeremiah
remained

Thus

but

Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
This
city
shall
surely

and

Then
the

said
unto
the

Let

pray
thee
put

forasmuch
weakeneth

and

speaking
such
words
unto
them
for
this
man
seeketh
not
the

hurt
Jeremiah
And
Zedekiah
the

said
Behold

Then

Then

Jeremiah
Ebed

and
went
into

and
took
thence

and
let

Jeremiah
And
Ebed

the

Put

And

Jeremiah
they
drew

cords
and
took
him
out

and
Jeremiah
remained

Then
Zedekiah
the
king
sent
and
took
Jeremiah
the
prophet
unto
him
into
the
third
entry
that
the
house
Jehovah
and
the
king
said
unto
Jeremiah
will
ask
thee
thing

Then
Jeremiah
said
unto
Zedekiah
declare
unto
thee
wilt
thou
not
surely
put
death
and
give
thee
counsel
thou
wilt
not
hearken

Zedekiah
the

sware
secretly
unto

saying
Jehovah

death
neither
will

Jeremiah
Then
said
Jeremiah
unto
Zedekiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
hosts
the
God
Israel
thou
wilt
forth
unto
the
king
Babylon
princes
then
thy
soul
shall
live
and
this
city
shall
not
burned
with
fire
and
thou
shalt
live
and
thy
house
Jeremiah
But
thou
wilt
not
forth
the
king
Babylon
princes
then
shall
this
city
given
into
the
hand
the
Chaldeans
and
they
shall
burn
with
fire
and
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
their
hand
Jeremiah
And
Zedekiah
the
king
said
unto
Jeremiah
afraid
the
Jews
that
are
fallen
away
the
Chaldeans
lest
they
deliver
into
their
hand
and
they
mock
Jeremiah
But
Jeremiah
said
They
shall
not
deliver
thee
Obey
beseech
thee
the
voice
Jehovah
that
which
speak
unto
thee
shall
well

thee
and
thy
soul
shall
live
Jeremiah
But
thou
refuse
forth
this
the
word
that
Jehovah
hath
showed
Jeremiah
Behold
all
the
women
that
are
left
the
king
Judah
house
shall

forth
the
king
Babylon
princes
and
those
women
shall
say
Thy
familiar
friends
have
set
thee
and
have
prevailed
over
thee
now
that
thy
feet
are
sunk
the
mire
they
are
turned
away
back
Jeremiah
And
they
shall
bring
out
all
thy
wives
and
thy
children
the
Chaldeans
and
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
their
hand
but
shalt
taken
the
hand
the
king
Babylon
and
thou
shalt
cause
this
city
burned
with
fire
Jeremiah
Then
said
Zedekiah
unto
Jeremiah
Let
man
know
these
words
and
thou
shalt
not
die
Jeremiah
But
the
princes
hear
that
have
talked
with
thee
and
they
come
unto
thee
and
say
unto
thee
Declare
unto
now
what
thou
hast
said
unto
the
king
hide
not
from
and
will
not
put
thee
death
also
what
the
king
said
unto
thee
Jeremiah
then
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
presented
supplication
before
the
king
that
would
not
cause

Jeremiah
Then
came
all
the
princes
unto
Jeremiah
and
asked
him
and
told
them
according
all
these
words
that
the
king
had
commanded
they
left

for

Jeremiah
Jeremiah
abode
the
court
the

until
the
day
that

And
came

when
Jerusalem

that
all

Samgar

Sarsechim
Rab

Nergal
sharezer
Rab

with
all
the

the
king
Babylon
Jeremiah
And
came
pass
that
when
Zedekiah
the
king
Judah
and
all
the
men
war
saw
them
then
they
fled
and
went
forth
out

city
night
the
way
the
king
garden
through
the
gate
betwixt
the
two
walls
and
went
out
toward
the
Arabah
Jeremiah
But
the
army
the
Chaldeans
pursued
after
them
and
overtook
Zedekiah
the
plains
Jericho
and
when
they
had
taken
him
they
brought
him
Nebuchadrezzar
king
Babylon
Riblah
the
land
Hamath
and
gave
judgment
upon
him
Jeremiah
Then
the
king
Babylon
slew
the
sons
Zedekiah
Riblah
before
his
eyes
also
the
king
Babylon
slew
all
the
nobles
Judah
Jeremiah
Moreover
put
out
Zedekiah
eyes
and
bound
him

carry
him

Jeremiah
And
the
Chaldeans
burned
the
king
house
and
the
houses
the
people
with
fire
and
brake
down
the
walls
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
Then
Nebuzaradan
the
captain
the
guard
carried
away
captive
into
Babylon
the
residue
the
people
that
remained
the
city
the
deserters
also
that
fell
away

and
the
residue
the
people
that
remained
Jeremiah
But
Nebuzaradan
the
captain
the
guard
left
the
poor
the
people
that
had
nothing
the
land
Judah
and
gave
them
vineyards
and
fields
the
same
time
Jeremiah
Now
Nebuchadrezzar
king
Babylon
gave
charge
concerning
Jeremiah
Nebuzaradan
the
captain
the
guard
saying
Jeremiah
Take
him
and
look
well
him
and
him
harm
but
unto
him
even
shall
say
unto
thee
Jeremiah
Nebuzaradan
the
captain
the
guard
sent
and
Nebushazban
Rab
saris
and
Nergal
sharezer
Rab
mag
and
all
the
chief
officers
the
king
Babylon
Jeremiah
they
sent
and
took
Jeremiah
out

and
committed
him
unto
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
the
son
Shaphan
that
should
carry
him
home
dwelt
among
the
people
Jeremiah
Now
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
Jeremiah
while
was
shut
the
court
the
guard
saying
Jeremiah
and
speak
Ebed
melech
the
Ethiopian
saying
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
Behold
will
bring
words
upon
this
city
for
evil
and
not
for
good
and
they
shall
accomplished
before
thee
that
day
Jeremiah
But
will
deliver
thee
that
day
saith
Jehovah
and
thou
shalt
not
given
into
the
hand
the
men
whom
thou
art
afraid
Jeremiah
For
will
surely
save
thee
and
thou
shalt
not
fall
the
sword
but
thy
life
shall
for
prey
unto
thee
because
thou
hast
put
thy
trust
saith
Jehovah
Jeremiah
The
word
which
came
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
after
that
Nebuzaradan
the
captain
the
guard
had
let
him
from
Ramah
when
had
taken
him
being
bound
chains
among
all
the
captives
Jerusalem
and
Judah
that
were
carried
away
captive
unto
Babylon
Jeremiah
And
the
captain
the
guard
took
Jeremiah
and
said
unto
him
Jehovah
thy
God
pronounced
this
evil
upon
this
place
Jeremiah
and
Jehovah
hath
brought
and
done
according
spake
because
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
and
have
not
obeyed
his
voice
therefore
this
thing
come
upon
you
Jeremiah
And
now
behold
loose
thee
this
day
from
the
chains
which
are
upon
thy
hand
seem
good
unto
thee
come
with
into
Babylon
come
and
will
look
well
unto
thee
but
seem
ill
unto
thee
come
with
into
Babylon
forbear
behold
all
the
land
before
thee
whither
seemeth
good
and
right
unto
thee
thither
Jeremiah
Now
while
was
not
yet
gone
back
back
then
said
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
the
son
Shaphan
whom
the
king
Babylon
hath
made
governor
over
the
cities
Judah
and
dwell
with
him
among
the
people
wheresoever
seemeth
right
unto
thee
the
captain
the
guard
gave
him
victuals
and
present
and
let
him
Jeremiah
Then
went
Jeremiah
unto
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
Mizpah
and
dwelt
with
him
among
the
people
that
were
left
the
land
Jeremiah
Now
when
all
the
captains
the
forces
that
were
the
fields
even
they
and
their
men
heard
that
the
king
Babylon
had
made
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
governor
the
land
and
had
committed
unto
him
men
and
women
and
children
and
the
poorest
the
land
them
that
were
not
carried
away
captive
Babylon
Jeremiah
then
they
came
Gedaliah
Mizpah
wit
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
and
Johanan
and
Jonathan
the
sons
Kareah
and
Seraiah
the
son
Tanhumeth
and
the
sons
Ephai
the
Netophathite
and
Jezaniah
the
son
the
Maacathite
they
and
their
men
Jeremiah
And
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
the
son
Shaphan
sware
unto
them
and
their
men
saying
Fear
not
serve
the
Chaldeans
dwell
the
land
and
serve
the
king
Babylon
and
shall
well
with
you
Jeremiah
for
behold
will
dwell
Mizpah
stand
before
the
Chaldeans
that
shall
come
unto
but
gather
wine
and
summer
fruits
and
oil
and
put
them
your
vessels
and
dwell
your
cities
that
have
taken
Jeremiah
Likewise
when
all
the
Jews
that
were
Moab
and
among
the
children
Ammon
and
Edom
and
that
were
all
the
countries
heard
that
the
king
Babylon
had
left
remnant
Judah
and
that
had
set
over
them
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
the
son
Shaphan
Jeremiah
then
all
the
Jews
returned
out
all
places
whither
they
were
driven
and
came
the
land
Judah
Gedaliah
unto
Mizpah
and
gathered
wine
and
summer
fruits
very
much
Jeremiah
Moreover
Johanan
the
son
Kareah
and
all
the
captains
the
forces
that
were
the
fields
came
Gedaliah
Mizpah
Jeremiah
and
said
unto
him
Dost
thou
know
that
Baalis
the
king
the
children
Ammon
hath
sent
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
take
thy
life
But
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
believed
them
not
Jeremiah
Then
Johanan
the
son
Kareah
spake
Gedaliah
Mizpah
secretly
saying
Let
pray
thee
and
will
slay
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
and
man
shall
know
wherefore
should
take
thy
life
that
all
the
Jews
that
are
gathered
unto
thee
should
scattered
and
the
remnant
Judah
perish
Jeremiah
But
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
said
unto
Johanan
the
son
Kareah
Thou
shalt
not
this
thing
for
thou
speakest
falsely
Ishmael
Jeremiah
Now
came
pass
the
seventh
month
that
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
the
son
Elishama
the
seed
royal
and
one
the
chief
officers
the
king
and
ten
men
with
him
came
unto
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
Mizpah
and
there
they
did
eat
bread
together
Mizpah
Jeremiah
Then
arose
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
and
the
ten
men
that
were
with
him
and
smote
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
the
son
Shaphan
with
the
sword
and
slew
him
whom
the
king
Babylon
had
made
governor
over
the
land
Jeremiah
Ishmael
also
slew
all
the
Jews
that
were
with
him
wit
with
Gedaliah
Mizpah
and
the
Chaldeans
that
were
found
there
the
men
war
Jeremiah
And
came
pass
the
second
day
after
had
slain
Gedaliah
and
man
knew
Jeremiah
that
there
came
men
from
Shechem
from
Shiloh
and
from
Samaria
even
fourscore
men
having
their
beards
shaven
and
their
clothes
rent
and
having
cut
themselves
with
meal
offerings
and
frankincense
their
hand
bring
them
the
house
Jehovah
Jeremiah
And
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
went
forth
from
Mizpah
meet
them
weeping
all
along
went
and
came
pass
met
them
said
unto
them
Come
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
Jeremiah
And
was
when
they
came
into
the
midst
the
city
that
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
slew
them
and
cast
them
into
the
midst
the
pit
and
the
men
that
were
with
him
Jeremiah
But
ten
men
were
found
among
them
that
said
unto
Ishmael
Slay
not
for
have
stores
hidden
the
field
wheat
and
barley
and
oil
and
honey
forbare
and
slew
them
not
among
their
brethren
Jeremiah
Now
the
pit
wherein
Ishmael
cast
all
the
dead
bodies
the
men
whom
had
slain
the
side
Gedaliah
the
same
was
that
which
Asa
the
king
had
made
for
fear
Baasha
king
Israel
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
filled
with
them
that
were
slain
Jeremiah
Then
Ishmael
carried
away
captive
all
the
residue
the
people
that
were
Mizpah
even
the
king
daughters
and
all
the
people
that
remained
Mizpah
whom
Nebuzaradan
the
captain
the
guard
had
committed
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
carried
them
away
captive
and
departed
over
the
children
Ammon
Jeremiah
But
when
Johanan
the
son
Kareah
and
all
the
captains
the
forces
that
were
with
him
heard
all
the
evil
that
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
had
done
Jeremiah
then
they
took
all
the
men
and
went
fight
with
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
and
found
him
the
great
waters
that
are
Gibeon
Jeremiah
Now
came
pass
that
when
all
the
people
that
were
with
Ishmael
saw
Johanan
the
son
Kareah
and
all
the
captains
the
forces
that
were
with
him
then
they
were
glad
Jeremiah
all
the
people
that
Ishmael
had
carried
away
captive
from
Mizpah
turned
about
and
came
back
and
went
unto
Johanan
the
son
Kareah
Jeremiah
But
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
escaped
from
Johanan
with
eight
men
and
went
the
children
Ammon
Jeremiah
Then
took
Johanan
the
son
Kareah
and
all
the
captains
the
forces
that
were
with
him
all
the
remnant
the
people
whom
had
recovered
from
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
from
Mizpah
after
that
had
slain
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
wit
the
men
war
and
the
women
and
the
children
and
the
eunuchs
whom
had
brought
back
from
Gibeon
Jeremiah
And
they
departed
and
dwelt
Geruth
Chimham
which
Beth
lehem
enter
into
Egypt
Jeremiah
because
the
Chaldeans
for
they
were
afraid
them
because
Ishmael
the
son
Nethaniah
had
slain
Gedaliah
the
son
Ahikam
whom
the
king
Babylon
made
governor
over
the
land
Jeremiah
Then
all
the
captains
the
forces
and
Johanan
the
son
Kareah
and
Jezaniah
the
son
Hoshaiah
and
all
the
people
from
the
least
even
unto
the
greatest
came
near
Jeremiah
and
said
unto
Jeremiah
the
prophet
Let
pray
thee
our
supplication
presented
before
thee
and
pray
for
unto
Jehovah
thy
God
even
for
all
this
remnant
for
are
left
but
few
many
thine
eyes
behold
Jeremiah
that
Jehovah
thy
God
may
show
the
way
wherein
should
walk
and
the
thing
that
should
Jeremiah
Then
Jeremiah
the
prophet
said
unto
them
have
heard
you
behold
will
pray
unto
Jehovah
your
God
according
your
words
and
shall
come
pass
that
whatsoever
thing
Jehovah
shall
answer
you
will
declare
unto
you
will
keep
nothing
back
from
you
Jeremiah
Then
they
said
Jeremiah
Jehovah
true
and
faithful
witness
amongst
not
according
all
the
word
wherewith
Jehovah
thy
God
shall
send
thee
Jeremiah
Whether

Jehovah
our

thee
that

well
with

Jehovah
our

Jeremiah
And
came
pass
after
ten
days
that
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
Jeremiah
Jeremiah
Then
called
Johanan
the
son
Kareah
and
all
the
captains
the
forces
that
were
with
him
and
all
the
people
from
the
least
even
the
greatest
Jeremiah
and
said
unto
them
Thus
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
unto
whom
sent
present
your
supplication
before
him
Jeremiah
will
still
abide
this
land
then
will
build
you
and
not
pull
you
down
and
will
plant
you
and
not
pluck
you
for
repent
the
evil
that
have
done
unto
you
Jeremiah
not
afraid
the
king
Babylon
whom
are
afraid
not
afraid
him
saith
Jehovah
for
with
you
save
you
and
deliver
you
from
his
hand
Jeremiah
And
will
grant
you
mercy
that
may
have
mercy
upon
you
and
cause
you
return
your
own
land
Jeremiah
But
say
will
not
dwell
this
land
that
obey
not
the
voice
Jehovah
your
God
Jeremiah
saying
but
will
into
the
land
Egypt
where
shall
see
war
nor
hear
the
sound
the
trumpet
nor
have
hunger
bread
and
there
will
dwell
Jeremiah
now
therefore
hear
the
word
Jehovah
remnant
Judah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
indeed
set
your
faces
enter
into
Egypt
and
sojourn
there
Jeremiah
then
shall
come
pass
that
the
sword
which
fear
shall
overtake
you
there
the
land
Egypt
and
the
famine
whereof
are
afraid
shall
follow
hard
after
you
there
Egypt
and
there
shall
die
Jeremiah
shall
with
all
the
men
that
set
their
faces
into
Egypt
sojourn
there
they
shall
die
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
and
none
them
shall
remain
escape
from
the
evil
that
will
bring
upon
them
Jeremiah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
mine
anger
and
wrath
hath
been
poured
forth
upon
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
shall
wrath
poured

when

enter
into

and
shall

and
shall
see
this
place

Jeremiah
Jehovah
hath
spoken
concerning
you
remnant
Judah
not
into

know
certainly
that
have
testified
unto
you
this
day
Jeremiah
For
have
dealt
deceitfully
against
your
own
souls
for
sent
unto
Jehovah
your
God
saying
Pray
for
unto
Jehovah
our
God
and
according
unto
all
that
Jehovah
our
God
shall
say
declare
unto

Jeremiah
And
have
this
day
declared
you
but
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
Jehovah
your
God
anything
for
which
hath
sent
unto
you
Jeremiah
Now
therefore
know
certainly
that
shall
die
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
the
place
whither
desire
sojourn
there
Jeremiah
And
came
pass
that
when
Jeremiah
had
made
end
speaking
unto
all
the
people
all
the
words
Jehovah
their
God
wherewith
Jehovah
their
God
had
sent
him
them
even
all
these
words
Jeremiah
then
spake
Azariah
the
son
Hoshaiah
and
Johanan
the
son
Kareah
and
all
the
proud
men
saying
unto
Jeremiah
Thou
speakest
falsely
Jehovah
our
God
hath
not
sent
thee
say

Jeremiah
but
Baruch

And
they
came
into

for
they
obeyed
not
the

and
they
came
unto

Jeremiah
Then
came
the

The

that
came
Jeremiah
concerning
all
the
Jews
that
dwelt
the
land
Egypt
that
dwelt
Migdol
and
Tahpanhes
and
Memphis
and
the

Pathros
saying
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
have
seen
all
the
evil
that
have
brought
upon
Jerusalem
and
upon
all
the
cities
Judah
and
behold
this
day
they
are

therein
Jeremiah
because
their
wickedness
which
they
have
committed
provoke
anger
that
they
went

incense
and
serve
other
gods
that
they
knew
not
neither
they

Jeremiah
Howbeit
sent
unto
you
all
servants
the
prophets
rising
early
and
sending
them
saying
not
this
abominable
thing
that
hate
Jeremiah
But
they
hearkened
not
nor
inclined
their
ear
turn
from
their
wickedness

incense
unto
other
gods
Jeremiah
Wherefore
wrath
and
mine
anger
was
poured
forth
and
was
kindled
the
cities
Judah
and
the
streets
Jerusalem
and
they
are
wasted
and
desolate
this
day
Jeremiah
Therefore
now
thus
saith
Jehovah
the

hosts
the
God
Israel
Wherefore

and
suckling

leave
you
none
remaining
Jeremiah
that
provoke
unto
anger
with
the
works
your

burning
incense
unto
other
gods
the
land
Egypt
whither
are
gone
sojourn
that
may
cut
off
and
that
may
curse
and
reproach
among
all
the
nations
the
earth
Jeremiah
Have
forgotten
the
wickedness
your
fathers
and
the
wickedness
the
kings
Judah
and
the
wickedness
their
wives
and
your
own
wickedness
and
the
wickedness
your
wives
which
they
committed
the
land
Judah
and
the
streets
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
They
are
not
humbled
even
unto
this
day
neither
have
they
feared
nor
walked
law
nor
statutes
that
set
before
you
and
before
your
fathers
Jeremiah
Therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
Behold
will
set
face
against
you
for
evil
even
cut
off
all
Judah
Jeremiah
And
will
take
the
remnant
Judah
that
have
set
their

there
and
they
shall
all
consumed
the

shall
they
fall
they
shall
consumed
the

and
the

they
shall
die
from
the
least
even
unto
the
greatest
the
sword
and
the
famine
and
they
shall
execration
and
astonishment
and
curse
and
reproach
Jeremiah
For
will
punish
them
that
dwell
the
land
Egypt
have
punished
Jerusalem
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
Jeremiah
that
none
the
remnant
Judah
that

sojourn
there
shall
escape
left
return
into
the
land
Judah
which
they
have
desire
return
dwell
there
for
none
shall
return
save
such
shall
escape
Jeremiah
Then
all
the
men
who
knew
that
their
wives
burned
incense
unto
other
gods
and
all
the
women
that
stood
great
assembly
even
all
the
people
that
dwelt
the
land
Egypt
Pathros
answered
Jeremiah
saying
Jeremiah
for
the
word
that
thou
hast
spoken
unto
the
name
Jehovah
will
not
hearken
unto
thee
Jeremiah
But
will
certainly
perform
every
word
that
gone
forth
out
our
mouth
burn
incense
unto
the
queen
heaven
and
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
have
done
and
our
fathers
our
kings
and
our
princes
the
cities
Judah
and
the
streets
Jerusalem
for
then
had
plenty
victuals
and
were
well
and
saw
evil
Jeremiah
But
since
left
off
burning
incense
the
queen
heaven
and
pouring
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
have
wanted
all
things
and
have
been
consumed
the
sword
and
the
famine
Jeremiah
And
when
burned
incense
the
queen
heaven
and
poured
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
did
make
her
cakes
worship
her
and
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
without
our
husbands
Jeremiah
Then
Jeremiah
said
unto
all
the
people
the
men
and
the
women
even
all
the
people
that
had
given
him
that
answer
saying
Jeremiah
The
incense
that
burned
the
cities
Judah
and
the
streets
Jerusalem
and
your
fathers
your
kings
and
your
princes
and
the
people
the
land
did
not
Jehovah
remember
them
and
came
not
into
his
mind
Jeremiah
that
Jehovah
could
not
longer
bear
because
the
evil
your
doings
and
because
the
abominations
which
have
committed
therefore
your
land
become
desolation
and
astonishment
and
curse
without
inhabitant
this
day
Jeremiah
Because
have
burned
incense
and
because
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
and
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
Jehovah
nor
walked
his
law
nor
his
statutes
nor
his
testimonies
therefore
this
evil
happened
unto
you
this
day
Jeremiah
Moreover
Jeremiah
said
unto
all
the
people
and
all
the
women
Hear
the
word
Jehovah
all
Judah
that
are
the
land
Egypt
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
the
God
Israel
saying
and
your
wives
have
both
spoken
with
your
mouths
and
with
your
hands
have
fulfilled
saying

surely
perform
our
vows
that
have
vowed
burn
incense
the
queen
heaven
and
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
establish
then
your
vows
and
perform
your
vows
Jeremiah
Therefore
hear
the
word
Jehovah
all
Judah
that
dwell
the
land
Egypt
Behold
have
sworn
great
name
saith
Jehovah
that
name
shall
more
named

man
Judah
all
the
land
Egypt
saying
the
Lord
Jehovah
liveth
Jeremiah
Behold
watch
over
them
for
evil
and
not
for
good
and
all
the
men
Judah
that
are
the
land
Egypt
shall
consumed
the
sword
and
the
famine
until
there
end
them
Jeremiah
And
they
that
escape
the
sword
shall
return
out
the
land
Egypt
into
the
land
Judah
few
number
and
all
the
remnant
Judah
that
are
gone
into
the
land
Egypt
sojourn
there
shall
know
whose
word
shall
stand
mine
theirs
Jeremiah
And
this
shall

sign

you
saith
Jehovah
that
will
punish
you
this
place
that
may
know
that
words
shall
surely
stand
against
you
for
evil
Jeremiah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
Behold

For

Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
The
broad

gates
shall
burned
with
fire
and
the
peoples
shall
labor
for
vanity
and
the
nations
for
the
fire
and
they
shall
weary
Jeremiah
The
word
which
Jeremiah
the
prophet
commanded
Seraiah
the
son
Neriah
the
son
Mahseiah
when
went
with
Zedekiah
the
king
Judah
Babylon
the
fourth
year
his
reign
Now
Seraiah
was
chief
chamberlain
Jeremiah
And
Jeremiah
wrote
book
all
the
evil
that
should
come
upon
Babylon
even
all
these
words
that
are
written
concerning
Babylon
Jeremiah
And
Jeremiah
said
Seraiah
When
thou
comest
Babylon
then
see
that
thou
read
all
these
words
Jeremiah
and
say
Jehovah
thou
hast
spoken
concerning
this
place
cut
off
that
none
shall
dwell
therein
neither
man
nor
beast
but
that
shall
desolate
for
ever
Jeremiah
And
shall
when
thou
hast
made
end
reading
this
book
that
thou
shalt
bind
stone
and
cast
into
the
midst
the
Euphrates
Jeremiah
and
thou
shalt
say
Thus
shall
Babylon
sink
and
shall
not
rise
again
because
the
evil
that
will
bring
upon
her
and
they
shall
weary
Thus
far
are
the
words
Jeremiah
Jeremiah
Zedekiah
was
one
and
twenty
years
old
when
began
reign
and
reigned
eleven
years
Jerusalem
and
his
mother
name
was
Hamutal
the
daughter
Jeremiah
Libnah
Jeremiah
And
did
that
which
was
evil
the
sight
Jehovah
according
all
that
Jehoiakim
had
done
Jeremiah
For
through
the
anger
Jehovah
did
come
pass
Jerusalem
and
Judah
until
had
cast
them
out
from
his
presence
And
Zedekiah
rebelled
against
the
king
Babylon
Jeremiah
And
came
pass
the
ninth
year
his
reign
the
tenth
month
the
tenth
day
the
month
that
Nebuchadrezzar
king

came
and
all
his
army
against

the

was
besieged
unto
the
eleventh

king
Zedekiah
Jeremiah
the
fourth
month
the
ninth
day
the
month
the
famine
was
sore
the
city
that
there
was
bread
for
the
people
the
land
Jeremiah
Then
breach
was
made
the
city
and
all
the
men
war
fled
and
went
forth
out
the
city
night
the
way
the
gate
between
the
two
walls
which
was
the
king
garden
now
the
Chaldeans
were
against
the
city
round
about
and
they
went
toward
the
Arabah
Jeremiah
But
the
army
the
Chaldeans
pursued
after
the
king
and
overtook
Zedekiah
the
plains
Jericho
and
all
his
army
was
scattered
from
him
Jeremiah
Then
they
took
the
king
and
carried
him
unto
the
king
Babylon
Riblah
the
land
Hamath
and
gave
judgment
upon
him
Jeremiah
And
the
king
Babylon
slew
the
sons
Zedekiah
before
his
eyes
slew
also
all
the
princes
Judah
Riblah
Jeremiah
And
put
out
the
eyes
Zedekiah
and
the
king
Babylon
bound
him
fetters
and
carried
him
Babylon
and
put
him
prison
till
the
day
his
death
Jeremiah
Now
the
fifth
month
the
tenth
day
the
month
which
was
the
nineteenth
year
king
Nebuchadrezzar
king
Babylon
came
Nebuzaradan
the
captain
the
guard
who
stood
before
the
king
Babylon
into
Jerusalem
Jeremiah
And
burned
the
house
Jehovah
and
the
king
house
and
all
the
houses
Jerusalem
even
every
great
house
burned
with
fire
Jeremiah
And
all
the
army
the
Chaldeans
that
were
with
the
captain
the
guard
brake
down
all
the
walls
Jerusalem
round
about
Jeremiah
Then
Nebuzaradan
the
captain
the
guard
carried
away
captive
the
poorest
the
people
and
the
residue
the
people
that
were
left
the
city
and
those
that
fell
away
that
fell
the
king
Babylon
and
the
residue
the
multitude
Jeremiah
But
Nebuzaradan
the
captain
the
guard
left
the
poorest
the

vinedressers
and
husbandmen
Jeremiah
And
the
pillars
brass
that
were
the
house
Jehovah
and
the
bases
and
the
brazen
sea
that
were
the
house
Jehovah
did
the
Chaldeans
break
pieces
and
carried
all
the
brass
them

Jeremiah
The
pots
also
and
the
shovels

Yet
thou

Again

Ezekiel
And
the

said
unto
him
through

and
set

upon
the
foreheads
the
men
that

Ezekiel
And
said
unto
them
Defile

And
they
went
forth

smote
the
city
Ezekiel
And
came

and
cried
and
said
Lord
Jehovah
wilt
thou
destroy
all
the
residue
Israel
thy
pouring
out
thy

upon

Ezekiel
Then
said
unto
The
iniquity
the
house
Israel
and
Judah
exceeding
great
and
the
land
full
blood
and
the
city
full
wresting
judgment
for
they
say
Jehovah
hath
forsaken
the

and
Jehovah
seeth
not
Ezekiel
And
for
also
mine
eye
shall
not
spare
neither
will
have

but
will
bring
their
way
upon
their
head
Ezekiel
And
behold
the
man
clothed

who
had
the

Now
the

Ezekiel
And
the

mounted
from
the
cherub
and
stood
over
the

and
the

was
filled
with
the

and
the

And
the

Ezekiel
And
came

when
commanded
the

clothed
linen
saying
Take

And
the

stretched
forth
his

Therefore

And

voice
and
said
Lord

Ezekiel
And
the

Jehovah
came
unto
saying
Ezekiel
Son

even
thy

and
all
the

all
them
are
they
unto
whom
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
have
said
Get
you

unto
this
land
given

Ezekiel
Therefore
say
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Whereas

and
whereas

countries
yet
will

Ezekiel
Therefore

Thus
saith
the

and
assemble
you
out

Ezekiel
And
they
shall
come
thither
and
they
shall
take
away
all
the
detestable
things
thereof
and
all
the
abominations
thereof
from
thence
Ezekiel
And
will
give
them
one
heart
and
will
put
new
spirit
within
you
and
will
take
the
stony
heart
out
their
flesh
and
will
give
them

Ezekiel
that
they
may
walk

and
keep
mine

But
for
them
whose

heart
their
detestable
things
and
their
abominations
will
bring
their
way
upon
their
own
heads
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Ezekiel
Then
did
the
cherubim
lift
their
wings
and
the
wheels
were
beside
them
and
the
glory
the
God
Israel
was
over
them
above
Ezekiel
And
the

Jehovah
went
from

and
stood
upon
the

And

Then
spake
unto
them
the

all
the
things
that
Jehovah
had
showed
Ezekiel
The
word
Jehovah
also
came
unto
saying
Ezekiel
Son

house
that

Ezekiel
Therefore
thou

Ezekiel
And
thou

and
thou
shalt

thyself
even

when

Ezekiel
Dig
thou

and
carry

thereby
Ezekiel
their
sight
shalt
thou
bear

thou
shalt
cover
thy

that
thou

Ezekiel
And

and
the
even
digged
through
the
wall
with
hand
brought
forth
the
dark
and
bare
upon

their
sight
Ezekiel
And
the
morning
came
the
word
Jehovah
unto
saying
Ezekiel
Son
man
hath
not
the
house
Israel
the
rebellious
house
said
unto
thee
What
doest
thou
Ezekiel
Say
thou
unto
them
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
This
burden
concerneth
the
prince
Jerusalem
and
all
the
house
Israel
among
whom
they
are
Ezekiel
Say

Ezekiel
And
the
prince
that

Ezekiel
net

and

and
will
bring

Ezekiel
And

all

and
all
his

and
will
draw
out
the
sword
after
them
Ezekiel
And
they
shall
know
that
Jehovah
when
shall
disperse
them
among
the
nations
and
scatter
them
through
the
countries
Ezekiel
But
will
leave
few
men
them
from
the
sword
from
the
famine
and
from
the
pestilence
that
they
may
declare
all
their
abominations
among
the
nations
whither
they
come
and
they
shall
know
that
Jehovah
Ezekiel
Moreover
the
word
Jehovah
came
saying
Ezekiel
Son
man
eat
thy
bread
with
quaking
and
drink
thy
water
with
trembling
and
with
fearfulness
Ezekiel
and
say
unto
the
people
the
land
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
concerning
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
and
the
land
Israel
They
shall
eat
their
bread
with
fearfulness
and
drink
their

dismay
that
her
land
may
desolate
and
despoiled
all
that

because

Ezekiel
And
the
cities
that

inhabited
shall
laid
waste
and
the
land
shall

and
shall
know
that
Jehovah
Ezekiel
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
saying
Ezekiel
Son
man
what
this
proverb
that
have
the
land
Israel
saying
The
days
are
prolonged
and
every
vision
faileth
Ezekiel
Tell
them
therefore
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
will
make
this
proverb
cease
and
they
shall
more
use
proverb
Israel
but
say
unto
them
The
days
are
hand
and
the
fulfilment
every
vision
Ezekiel
For
there
shall
more
any
false
vision
nor
flattering
divination
within
the
house
Israel
Ezekiel
For
Jehovah
will
speak
and
the
word
that
shall
speak
shall
performed
shall
more
deferred
for
your
days
rebellious
house
will
speak
the
word
and
will
perform
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Ezekiel
Again
the
word
Jehovah
came
saying
Ezekiel
Son
man
behold
they
the
house
Israel
say
The
vision
that
seeth
for
many
days
come
and
prophesieth
times
that

off
Ezekiel
Therefore
say
unto
them
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
There
shall
none
words
deferred
any
more
but
the
word
which
shall
speak
shall
performed
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Ezekiel
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
saying
Ezekiel
Son
man
prophesy
against
the
prophets
Israel
that
prophesy
and
say
thou
unto
them
that
prophesy
out
their
own
heart
Hear
the
word
Jehovah
Ezekiel
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Woe
unto
the
foolish
prophets
that
follow
their
own
spirit
and
have
seen
nothing
Ezekiel
Israel
thy
prophets
have
been
like
foxes
the
waste
places
Ezekiel
have
not
gone
into
the
gaps
neither
built
the
wall
for
the
house
Israel
stand
the
battle
the
day
Jehovah
Ezekiel
They
have
seen
falsehood
and
lying
divination
that
say
Jehovah
saith
but
Jehovah
hath
not
sent
them
and
they
have
made
men
hope
that
the
word
would
confirmed
Ezekiel
Have
not
seen
false
vision
and
have
not
spoken
lying
divination
that
say
Jehovah
saith
albeit
have
not
spoken
Ezekiel
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Because
have
spoken
falsehood
and
seen
lies
therefore
behold
against
you
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Ezekiel
And
hand
shall
against
the
prophets
that
see
false
visions
and
that
divine
lies
they
shall
not

council
people
neither
shall
they
written
the
writing
the
house
Israel
neither
shall
they
enter
into
the
land
Israel
and
shall
know
that
the
Lord
Jehovah
Ezekiel
Because
even
because
they
have
seduced
people
saying
Peace
and
there
peace
and
when
one
buildeth
wall
behold
they
daub
with
untempered
mortar
Ezekiel
say
unto
them
that
daub
with
untempered
mortar
that

fall
there
shall
overflowing
shower
and
great
hailstones
shall
fall
and
stormy
wind
shall
rend
Ezekiel
when
the
wall
fallen
shall
not
said
unto
you
Where
the
daubing
wherewith
have
daubed
Ezekiel
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
will
even
rend
with
stormy
wind
wrath
and
there
shall
overflowing
shower
mine
anger
and
great
hailstones
wrath
consume
Ezekiel
will
break
down
the
wall
that
have
daubed
with
untempered
mortar
and
bring
down
the
ground
that
the
foundation
thereof
shall
uncovered
and
shall
fall
and
shall
consumed
the
midst
thereof
and
shall
know
that
Jehovah
Ezekiel
Thus
will
accomplish
wrath
upon
the
wall
and
upon
them
that
have
daubed
with
untempered
mortar
and
will
say
unto
you
The
wall
more
neither
they
that
daubed
Ezekiel
wit
the
prophets
Israel
that
prophesy
concerning
Jerusalem
and
that
see
visions
peace
for
her
and
there
peace
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Ezekiel
And
thou
son
man
set
thy
face
against
the
daughters
thy
people
that
prophesy
out
their
own
heart
and
prophesy
thou
against
them
Ezekiel
and
say
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Woe
the
women
that
sew
pillows
upon
all
elbows
and
make
kerchiefs
for
the
head
persons
every
stature
hunt
souls
Will
hunt
the
souls
people
and
save
souls
alive
for
yourselves
Ezekiel
And
have
profaned
among
people
for
handfuls
barley
and
for
pieces
bread
slay
the
souls
that
should
not
die
and
save
the
souls
alive
that
should
not
live
your
lying
people
that
hearken
unto
lies
Ezekiel
Wherefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Behold
against
your
pillows
wherewith
there
hunt
the
souls
make
them
fly
and
will
tear
them
from
your
arms
and
will
let
the
souls
even
the
souls
that
hunt
make
them
fly
Ezekiel
Your
kerchiefs
also
will
tear
and
deliver
people
out
your
hand
and
they
shall
more
your
hand
hunted
and
shall
know
that
Jehovah
Ezekiel
Because
with
lies
have
grieved
the
heart
the
righteous
whom
have
not
made
sad
and
strengthened
the
hands
the
wicked
that
should
not
return
from
his
wicked
way
and
saved
alive
Ezekiel
Therefore
shall
more
see
false
visions
nor
divine
divinations
and
will
deliver
people
out
your
hand
and
shall
know
that
Jehovah
Ezekiel
Then
came
certain
the
elders
Israel
unto
and
sat
before
Ezekiel
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
saying
Ezekiel
Son
man
these
men
have
taken
their
idols
into
their
heart
and
put
the
stumblingblock
their
iniquity
before

inquired
all
them
Ezekiel
Therefore
speak
unto
them
and
say
unto
them
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Every
man
the
house
Israel
that
taketh
his
idols
into
his
heart
and
putteth
the
stumblingblock
his
iniquity
before
his
face
and
cometh
the
prophet
Jehovah
will
answer
him
therein
according
the
multitude

idols
Ezekiel
that
may
take
the
house
Israel
their
own
heart
because
they
are
all
estranged
from

their
idols
Ezekiel
Therefore
say
unto
the
house
Israel
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Return
and
turn
yourselves
from
your
idols
and
turn
away
your
faces
from
all
your
abominations
Ezekiel
For
every
one
the
house
Israel
the
strangers
that
sojourn
Israel
that
separateth
himself
from

taketh
his
idols
into
his
heart
and
putteth
the
stumblingblock
his
iniquity
before
his
face
and
cometh
the
prophet
inquire
for
himself
Jehovah
will
answer
him
myself
Ezekiel
and
will
set
face
against
that
man
and
will
make
him
astonishment
for
sign
and
proverb
and
will
cut
him
off
from
the
midst
people
and
shall
know
that
Jehovah
Ezekiel
And
the
prophet
deceived
and
speak
word
Jehovah
have
deceived
that
prophet
and
will
stretch
out
hand
upon
him
and
will
destroy
him
from
the
midst
people
Israel
Ezekiel
And
they
shall
bear
their
iniquity
the
iniquity
the
prophet
shall
even
the
iniquity
him
that
seeketh
unto
him
Ezekiel
that
the
house
Israel
may
more
astray
from
neither
defile
themselves
any
more
with
all
their
transgressions
but
that
they
may
people
and
may
their
God
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Ezekiel
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
saying
Ezekiel
Son

Ezekiel
though

Ezekiel
bring

Ezekiel
though

For

even
concerning

And
they

saith
the

Jehovah
Ezekiel
And
the

Jehovah
came
unto
saying
Ezekiel
Son
man
what
the
vine

Ezekiel
Shall

Ezekiel
Behold

Ezekiel
Behold

was
meet
for
work
how
much
less

Ezekiel
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
the
vine
tree
among
the
trees
the
forest
which

given
the
fire
for
fuel
will
give
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
Ezekiel
And

shall
devour
them
and

that
Jehovah
when
set
face
against
them
Ezekiel
And
will
make
the

desolate
because
they
have
committed

Jehovah
Ezekiel
Again

Thus

And

Ezekiel
And

Now

and

with

saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
and
thou
becamest
mine
Ezekiel
Then
washed
thee
with
water
yea
thoroughly
washed
away
thy
blood
from
thee
and
anointed
thee
with

Ezekiel
clothed
thee
also
with

saith
the

Jehovah
Ezekiel
But

Thou

Moreover

But

Ezekiel
caused
them

Ezekiel
And
gave
them

and
showed

Ezekiel
Moreover
also
gave
them
sabbaths
sign
between

But
the

But

Ezekiel
Nevertheless
mine

And

Moreover
sware
unto

that

Ezekiel
because

For
when

then
they
saw
every

and
there
they
presented
the

Therefore

And

unto

Thou

There

Ezekiel
Her

Ezekiel
And
her

seeing
false

saying
Thus
saith
the

Jehovah
when

The

they

And

that

build
the

and
stand
the

Therefore

The

Jehovah
came
again
unto

Ezekiel
Son
man
there
were
two
women
the
daughters
one
mother
Ezekiel
and
they
played
the
harlot
Egypt
they
played
the
harlot
their
youth
there
were
their
breasts
pressed
and
there
was
handled
the
bosom
their
virginity
Ezekiel
And
the
names
them
were
Oholah
the
elder
and
Oholibah
her
sister
and
they
became
mine
and
they
bare
sons
and
daughters
And
for
their
names
Samaria
Oholah
and
Jerusalem
Oholibah
Ezekiel
And
Oholah
played
the
harlot
when
she
was
mine
and
she
doted
her
lovers
the
Assyrians
her
neighbors
Ezekiel
who
were
clothed
with
blue
governors
and
rulers
all
them
desirable
young
men
horsemen
riding

Ezekiel
And
she
bestowed
her
whoredoms
upon
them
the
choicest
men
Assyria
all
them
and
whomsoever
she
doted
with
all
their
idols
she
defiled
herself
Ezekiel
Neither
hath
she
left
her
whoredoms
since
the
days
Egypt
for
her
youth
they
lay
with
her
and
they
handled
the
bosom
her
virginity
and
they
poured
out
their
whoredom
upon
her
Ezekiel
Wherefore
delivered
her
into
the
hand
her
lovers
into
the
hand
the
Assyrians
upon
whom
she
doted
Ezekiel
These
uncovered
her
nakedness
they
took
her
sons
and
her
daughters
and
her
they
slew
with
the
sword
and
she
became
byword
among
women
for
they
executed
judgments
upon
her
Ezekiel
And
her
sister
Oholibah
saw
this
yet
was
she
more
corrupt
her
doting
than
she
and
her
whoredoms
which
were
more
than
the
whoredoms
her
sister
Ezekiel
She
doted
upon
the
Assyrians
governors
and
rulers
her
neighbors
clothed
most
gorgeously
horsemen
riding
upon
horses
all
them
desirable
young
men
Ezekiel
And
saw
that
she
was
defiled
they
both
took
one
way
Ezekiel
And
she
increased
her
whoredoms
for
she
saw
men
portrayed
upon
the
wall
the
images
the
Chaldeans
portrayed
with
vermilion
Ezekiel
girded
with
girdles
upon
their
loins
with
flowing
turbans
upon
their
heads
all
them
princes
look
upon
after
the
likeness
the
Babylonians
Chaldea
the
land
their
nativity
Ezekiel
And
soon
she
saw
them
she
doted
upon
them
and
sent
messengers
unto
them
into
Chaldea
Ezekiel
And
the
Babylonians
came
her
into
the
bed
love
and
they
defiled
her
with
their
whoredom
and
she
was
polluted
with
them
and
her
soul
was
alienated
from
them
Ezekiel
she
uncovered
her
whoredoms
and
uncovered
her
nakedness
then
soul
was
alienated
from
her
like
soul
was
alienated
from
her
sister
Ezekiel
Yet
she
multiplied
her
whoredoms
remembering
the
days
her
youth
wherein
she
had
played
the
harlot
the
land
Egypt
Ezekiel
And
she
doted
upon
their
paramours
whose
flesh
the
flesh
asses
and
whose
issue
like
the
issue
horses
Ezekiel
Thus
thou
calledst
remembrance
the
lewdness
thy
youth
the
handling
thy
bosom
the
Egyptians
for
the
breasts
thy
youth
Ezekiel
Therefore
Oholibah
thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Behold
will
raise
thy
lovers
against
thee
from
whom
thy
soul
alienated
and
will
bring
them
against
thee
every
side
Ezekiel
the
Babylonians
and
all
the
Chaldeans
Pekod
and
Shoa
and
Koa
and
all
the
Assyrians
with
them
desirable
young
men
governors
and
rulers
all
them
princes
and
men
renown
all
them
riding
upon
horses
Ezekiel
And
they
shall
come
against
thee
with
weapons
chariots
and
wagons
and
with
company
peoples
they
shall
set
themselves
against
thee
with
buckler
and
shield
and
helmet
round
about
and
will
commit
the
judgment
unto
them
and
they
shall
judge
thee
according
their
judgments
Ezekiel
And
will
set
jealousy
against
thee
and
they
shall
deal
with
thee
fury
they
shall
take
away
thy
nose
and
thine
ears
and
thy
residue
shall
fall

sword
they
shall
take
thy
sons
and
thy

and
thy
residue
shall
devoured
the
fire
Ezekiel
They
shall
also
strip
thee
thy
clothes
and
take
away
thy
fair
jewels
Ezekiel
Thus
will
make
thy
lewdness
cease
from
thee
and
thy
whoredom
brought
from
the
land
Egypt
that
thou
shalt
not
lift
thine
eyes
unto
them
nor
remember
Egypt
any
more
Ezekiel
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Behold
will
deliver
thee
into
the
hand
them
whom
thou
hatest
into
the
hand
them
from
whom
thy
soul
alienated
Ezekiel
and
they
shall
deal
with
thee
hatred
and
shall
take
away
all
thy
labor
and
shall
leave
thee
naked
and
bare
and
the
nakedness
thy
whoredoms
shall
uncovered
both
thy
lewdness
and
thy
whoredoms
Ezekiel
These
things
shall
done
unto
thee
for
that
thou
hast
played
the
harlot
after
the
nations
and
because
thou
art
polluted
with
their
idols
Ezekiel
Thou
hast
walked
the
way
thy
sister
therefore
will
give
her
cup
into
thy
hand
Ezekiel
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Thou
shalt
drink
thy
sister
cup
which
deep
and
large
thou
shalt
laughed
scorn
and
had
derision
containeth
much
Ezekiel
Thou
shalt
filled
with
drunkenness
and
sorrow
with
the
cup
astonishment
and
desolation
with
the
cup
thy
sister
Samaria
Ezekiel
Thou
shalt
even
drink
and
drain
out
and
thou
shalt
gnaw
the
sherds
thereof
and
shalt
tear
thy
breasts
for

spoken
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Ezekiel
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Because
thou
hast
forgotten
and
cast
behind
thy
back
therefore
bear
thou
also
thy
lewdness
and
thy
whoredoms
Ezekiel
Jehovah
said
moreover
unto
Son
man
wilt
thou
judge
Oholah
and
Oholibah
then
declare
unto
them
their
abominations
Ezekiel
For
they
have
committed
adultery
and
blood
their
hands
and
with
their
idols
have
they
committed
adultery
and
they
have
also
caused
their
sons
whom
they
bare
unto
pass
through
the
fire
unto
them
devoured
Ezekiel
Moreover
this
they
have
done
unto
they
have
defiled
sanctuary
the
same
day
and
have
profaned
sabbaths
Ezekiel
For
when
they
had
slain
their
children
their
idols
then
they
came
the
same
day
into
sanctuary
profane
and
thus
have
they
done
the
midst
house
Ezekiel
And
furthermore
have
sent
for
men
that
come
from
far
unto
whom
messenger
was
sent
and
they
came
for
whom
thou
didst
wash
thyself
paint
thine
eyes
and
deck
thyself
with
ornaments
Ezekiel
and
sit
upon
stately
bed
with
table
prepared
before
whereupon
thou
didst
set
mine
incense
and
mine
oil
Ezekiel
And
the
voice
multitude
being
ease
was
with
her
and
with
men
the
common
sort
were
brought
drunkards
from
the
wilderness
and
they
put
bracelets
upon
the
hands
them
twain
and
beautiful
crowns
upon
their
heads
Ezekiel
Then
said
her
that
was
old
adulteries
Now
will
they
play
the
harlot
with
her
and
she
with
them
Ezekiel
And
they
went
unto
her
they
unto
harlot
went
they
unto
Oholah
and
unto
Oholibah
the
lewd
women
Ezekiel
And
righteous
men
they
shall
judge
them
with
the
judgment
adulteresses
and
with
the
judgment
women
that
shed
blood
because
they
are
adulteresses
and

hands
Ezekiel
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
will
bring
company
against
them
and
will
give
them
tossed
and
fro
and
robbed
Ezekiel
And
the
company
shall
stone
them
with
stones
and
despatch
them
with
their
swords
they
shall
slay
their
sons
and
their
daughters
and
burn
their
houses
with
fire
Ezekiel
Thus
will
cause
lewdness
cease
out
the
land
that
all
women
may
taught
not
after
your
lewdness
Ezekiel
And
they
shall
recompense
your
lewdness
upon
you
and
shall
bear
the
sins
your
idols
and
shall
know
that

Ezekiel
And

Thus

Take

Wherefore

For

Ezekiel
That

Therefore
thus
saith

Ezekiel
Heap
the
wood
make

Then

She

grow
the
rivers
thereof
ran
round
about
its
plantation
and
sent
out
its
channels
unto
all
the

Ezekiel
Therefore
its
stature
was
exalted
above
all
the

All

Ezekiel
Thus

Ezekiel
The

Ezekiel
And

Upon
his
ruin
all
the
birds

and
restrained
the

thereof
and
the
great
waters
were
stayed
and
caused
Lebanon

for
him
and
all
the
trees
the
field
fainted
for
him
Ezekiel
made
the
nations
shake
the
sound
his
fall
when
cast
him
down
Sheol
with
them
that
descend
into
the
pit
and
all
the
trees
Eden
the
choice
and
best
Lebanon
all
that
drink
water
were
comforted
the
nether
parts

earth
Ezekiel
They
also
went
down
into
Sheol
with
him
unto
them
that
are
slain

yea
they
that

dwelt
under
his
shadow
the

Ezekiel
whom
art
thou
thus
like
glory
and
greatness
among

Eden
yet
shalt
thou
brought
down
with
the

Ezekiel
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah

And
the

came
unto
saying
Ezekiel
Son
man
speak
the
children
thy
people
and
say
unto
them
When

the
sword
upon

and
the
people
the

take
man
from

and
set
him
for
their
watchman
Ezekiel
when
seeth
the
sword
come
upon
the
land
blow
the
trumpet
and
warn
the
people
Ezekiel
then
whosoever
heareth
the
sound
the
trumpet
and
taketh
not
warning
the
sword
come
and
take
him
away
his
blood
shall
upon
his

head
Ezekiel
heard
the
sound
the
trumpet
and
took
not
warning
his
blood
shall
upon
him
whereas
had
taken
warning
would
have
delivered
his
soul
Ezekiel
But
the
watchman
see
the
sword
come
and
blow
not
the
trumpet
and
the
people
not
warned
and
the
sword
come
and
take
any

from
among
them
taken
away
his
iniquity
but
his
blood
will
require
the
watchman
hand
Ezekiel
thou
son
man
have
set
thee
watchman
unto
the
house
Israel
therefore
hear
the
word
mouth
and
give
them
warning
from
Ezekiel
When
say
unto
the
wicked
wicked
man
thou
shalt
surely
die
and
thou
dost
not
speak
warn
the
wicked
from
his
way
that
wicked
man
shall
die
his
iniquity
but
his

will
require
thy
hand
Ezekiel
Nevertheless
thou
warn
the
wicked
his
way
turn
from
and
turn
not
from
his
way
shall
die
his
iniquity
but
thou
hast
delivered
thy

Ezekiel
And
thou
son
man
say
unto
the
house
Israel
Thus
speak
saying
Our
transgressions
and
our
sins
are
upon

pine
away
them
how
then

Ezekiel
Say
unto

Ezekiel
And
thou
son
man
say
unto
the
children
thy
people
The

the
righteous
shall
not
deliver
him
the
day
his
transgression
and
for
the
wickedness
the
wicked
shall
not
fall
thereby
the
day
that
turneth
from
his
wickedness
neither
shall
that
righteous
able
live
thereby
the
day
that
sinneth
Ezekiel
When
say
the
righteous
that
shall
surely
live
trust
his
righteousness
and
commit
iniquity
none
his
righteous
deeds
shall
remembered
but
his
iniquity
that
hath
committed
therein
shall
die
Ezekiel
Again
when
say
unto
the
wicked
Thou
shalt
surely
die
turn
from
his
sin
and
that
which
lawful
and
right
Ezekiel
the
wicked
restore
the
pledge
give
again
that
which
had
taken
robbery
walk

committing

shall
surely
live

Ezekiel
None
his
sins
that

committed
shall
remembered
against

that
which

live
Ezekiel
Yet
the
children
thy
people
say
The

equal
but
for
them
their
way
not

Ezekiel
When
the
righteous
turneth
from
his
righteousness
and
committeth
iniquity
shall

die
therein
Ezekiel
And
when
the
wicked
turneth
from

and

thereby
Ezekiel
Yet
say
The

house
Israel
will
judge
you
every

after
his
ways
Ezekiel
And
came
pass
the
twelfth
year
our
captivity
the
tenth
month
the
fifth
day
the
month
that
one
that
had
escaped
out
Jerusalem
came
unto
saying
The
city
smitten
Ezekiel
Now
the
hand
Jehovah
had
been
upon
the
evening
before
that
was
escaped
came
and
had
opened
mouth
until
came
the
morning
and
mouth
was
opened
and
was
more
dumb
Ezekiel
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
saying
Ezekiel
Son
man
they
that
inhabit
those
waste
places
the
land
Israel
speak
saying
Abraham
was
one
and
inherited
the
land
but
are
many
the
land
given
for
inheritance
Ezekiel
Wherefore
say
unto
them
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
eat
with
the
blood
and
lift
your
eyes
unto
your
idols
and
shed
blood
and
shall
possess
the
land
Ezekiel
stand
upon
your
sword
work
abomination
and
defile
every
one
his
neighbor
wife
and
shall
possess
the
land
Ezekiel
Thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
live
surely
they
that
are
the
waste
places
shall
fall
the
sword
and
him
that
the
open
field
will
give
the
beasts
devoured
and
they
that
are
the
strongholds
and
the
caves
shall
die
the
pestilence
Ezekiel
And
will
make
the
land
desolation
and
astonishment
and
the
pride
her
power
shall
cease
and
the
mountains
Israel
shall
desolate
that
none
shall
pass
through
Ezekiel
Then
shall
they
know
that
Jehovah
when
have
made
the
land
desolation
and
astonishment
because
all
their
abominations
which
they
have
committed
Ezekiel
And
for
thee
son
man
the
children
thy
people
talk
thee
the
walls
and
the
doors
the
houses
and
speak
one
another
every
one
his
brother
saying
Come
pray
you
and
hear
what
the
word
that
cometh
forth
from
Jehovah
Ezekiel
And
they
come
unto
thee
the
people
cometh
and
they
sit
before
thee
people
and
they
hear
thy
words
but
them
not
for
with
their
mouth
they
show
much
love
but
their
heart
goeth
after
their
gain
Ezekiel
And
thou
art
unto
them
very
lovely
song
one
that
hath
pleasant
voice
and
can
play
well
instrument
for
they
hear
thy
words
but
they
them
not
Ezekiel
And
when
this
cometh
pass
behold
cometh
then
shall
they
know
that
prophet
hath
been
among
them
Ezekiel
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
saying
Ezekiel
Son
man
prophesy
against
the
shepherds
Israel
prophesy
and
say
unto
them
even
the
shepherds
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Woe
unto
the
shepherds
Israel
that
feed
themselves
should
not
the
shepherds
feed
the
sheep
Ezekiel
eat
the
fat
and
clothe
you
with
the
wool
kill
the
fatlings
but
feed
not
the
sheep
Ezekiel
The
diseased
have
not
strengthened
neither
have
healed
that
which
was
sick
neither
have
bound
that
which
was
broken
neither
have
brought
back
that
which
was
driven
away
neither
have
sought
that
which
was
lost
but
with
force
and
with
rigor
have
ruled
over
them
Ezekiel
And
they
were
scattered
because
there
was
shepherd
and
they
became
food
all
the
beasts
the
field
and
were
scattered
Ezekiel
sheep
wandered
through
all
the
mountains
and
upon
every
high
hill
yea
sheep
were
scattered
upon
all
the
face
the
earth
and
there
was
none
that
did
search
seek
after
them
Ezekiel
Therefore
shepherds
hear
the
word
Jehovah
Ezekiel
live
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
surely
forasmuch
sheep
became
prey
and
sheep
became
food
all
the
beasts
the
field
because
there
was
shepherd
neither
did
shepherds
search
for
sheep
but
the
shepherds
fed
themselves
and
fed
not
sheep
Ezekiel
therefore
shepherds
hear
the
word
Jehovah
Ezekiel
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Behold
against
the
shepherds
and
will
require
sheep
their
hand
and
cause
them
cease
from
feeding
the
sheep
neither
shall
the
shepherds
feed
themselves
any
more
and
will
deliver
sheep
from
their
mouth
that
they
may
not
food
for
them
Ezekiel
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Behold
myself
even
will
search
for
sheep
and
will
seek
them
out
Ezekiel
shepherd
seeketh
out
his
flock
the
day
that
among
his
sheep
that
are
scattered
abroad
will
seek
out
sheep
and
will
deliver
them
out
all
places
whither
they
have
been
scattered
the
cloudy
and
dark
day
Ezekiel
And
will
bring
them
out
from
the
peoples
and
gather
them
from
the
countries
and
will
bring
them
into
their
own
land
and
will
feed
them
upon
the
mountains
Israel
the
watercourses
and
all
the
inhabited
places
the
country
Ezekiel
will
feed
them
with
good
pasture
and
upon
the
mountains
the
height
Israel
shall
their
fold
there
shall
they
lie
down
good
fold
and
fat
pasture
shall
they
feed
upon
the
mountains
Israel
Ezekiel
myself
will
the
shepherd
sheep
and
will
cause
them
lie
down
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Ezekiel
will
seek
that
which
was
lost
and
will
bring
back
that
which
was
driven
away
and
will
bind
that
which
was
broken
and
will
strengthen
that
which
was
sick
but
the
fat
and
the
strong
will
destroy
will
feed
them
justice
Ezekiel
And
for
you
flock
thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Behold
judge
between
sheep
and
sheep
the
rams
and
the
goats
Ezekiel
Seemeth
small
thing
unto
you
have
fed
upon
the
good
pasture
but
must
tread
down
with
your
feet
the
residue
your
pasture
and
have
drunk
the
clear
waters
but
must
foul
the
residue
with
your
feet
Ezekiel
And
for
sheep
they
eat
that
which
have
trodden
with
your
feet
and
they
drink
that
which
have
fouled
with
your
feet
Ezekiel
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
unto
them
Behold
even
will
judge
between
the
fat
sheep
and
the
lean
sheep
Ezekiel
Because
thrust
with
side
and
with
shoulder
and
push
all
the
diseased
with
your
horns
till
have
scattered
them
abroad
Ezekiel
therefore
will
save
flock
and
they
shall
more
prey
and
will
judge
between
sheep
and
sheep
Ezekiel
And
will
set
one
shepherd
over
them
and
shall
feed
them
even
servant
David
shall
feed
them
and
shall
their
shepherd
Ezekiel
And
Jehovah
will
their
God
and
servant
David
prince
among
them
Jehovah
have
spoken
Ezekiel
And
will
make
with
them
covenant
peace
and
will
cause
evil
beasts
cease
out
the
land
and
they
shall
dwell
securely
the
wilderness
and
sleep
the
woods
Ezekiel
And
will
make
them
and
the
places
round
about
hill
blessing
and
will
cause
the
shower
come
down
its
season
there
shall
showers
blessing
Ezekiel
And
the
tree
the
field
shall
yield
its
fruit
and
the
earth
shall
yield
its
increase
and
they
shall
secure
their
land
and
they
shall
know
that
Jehovah
when
have
broken
the
bars
their
yoke
and
have
delivered
them
out
the
hand
those
that
made
bondmen
them
Ezekiel
And
they
shall
more
prey
the
nations
neither
shall
the
beasts
the
earth
devour
them
but
they
shall
dwell
securely
and
none
shall
make
them
afraid
Ezekiel
And
will
raise
unto
them
plantation
for
renown
and
they
shall
more
consumed
with
famine
the
land
neither
bear
the
shame
the
nations
any
more
Ezekiel
And
they
shall
know
that
Jehovah
their
God
with
them
and
that
they
the
house
Israel
are
people
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Ezekiel
And
sheep
the
sheep

are
men
and
your
God
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Ezekiel
Moreover
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
saying
Ezekiel
Son
man
set
thy
face
against

Seir
and
prophesy
against
Ezekiel
and
say
unto
Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Behold
against
thee

Seir
and
will
stretch
out
hand
against
thee
and
will
make
thee
desolation
and
astonishment
Ezekiel
will
lay
thy
cities
waste
and
thou
shalt
desolate
and
thou
shalt
know
that
Jehovah
Ezekiel
Because
thou
hast
had
perpetual
enmity
and
hast
given
over
the
children
Israel
the
power
the
sword
the
time
their
calamity
the
time
the

Ezekiel
therefore
live
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
will
prepare
thee
unto
blood
and
blood
shall
pursue
thee
since
thou
hast
not
hated
blood
therefore
blood
shall
pursue
thee
Ezekiel
Thus
will
make
mount
Seir
astonishment
and
desolation
and
will
cut
off
from
him
that
passeth
through
and
him
that
returneth
Ezekiel
And
will
fill
its
mountains
with
its
slain
thy
hills
and
thy
valleys
and
all
thy
watercourses
shall
they
fall
that
are
slain
with
the
sword
Ezekiel
will
make
thee
perpetual
desolation
and
thy
cities
shall
not
inhabited
and
shall
know
that
Jehovah
Ezekiel
Because
thou
hast
said
These
two
nations
and
these
two
countries
shall
mine
and
will
possess
whereas
Jehovah
was
there
Ezekiel
therefore

saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
will
according
thine
anger
and
according
thine
envy
which
thou
hast
showed
out
thy
hatred
against
them
and
will
make
myself
known
among
them
when

judge
thee
Ezekiel
And
thou
shalt
know
that
Jehovah
have
heard
all
thy
revilings
which
thou
hast
spoken
against
the
mountains
Israel
saying
They

And

Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
When

Ezekiel
thou
didst
rejoice
over
the

because

will
unto
thee
thou
shalt
desolate
mount

Thus
saith
the

Ezekiel
therefore
prophesy
and

Thus
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Because
they
say
unto
you
Thou

art
devourer
men
and

Ezekiel
Moreover
the

came
unto

Ezekiel
Son

land
they
defiled
their

woman
her

Ezekiel
Wherefore
poured
out
wrath
upon
them
for
the

which
they
had
poured
out
upon
the
land
and
because
they
had
defiled
with

Ezekiel
and

Then

Ezekiel
When

shall
they

but
there
they
shall
lay
their

wherein
they
minister
for
they
are
holy
and
they
shall
put

Ezekiel
Now

Afterward

Daniel
the

the

Jehoiakim
king
Judah
came
Nebuchadnezzar
king
Babylon
unto
Jerusalem
and
besieged
Daniel
And
the
Lord
gave
Jehoiakim
king
Judah
into
his
hand
with
part
the
vessels
the
house
God
and
carried
them
into
the
land
Shinar
the
house
his
god
and
brought
the
vessels
into
the
treasure
house
his
god
Daniel
And
the
king
spake
unto
Ashpenaz
the
master
his
eunuchs
that
should
bring
certain
the
children
Israel
even
the
seed
royal
and
the
nobles
Daniel
youths
whom
was
blemish
but
well
favored
and
skilful
all
wisdom
and
endued
with
knowledge
and
understanding
science
and
such
had
ability
stand
the
king
palace
and
that
should
teach
them
the
learning
and
the
tongue
the
Chaldeans
Daniel
And
the
king
appointed
for
them
daily
portion
the
king
dainties
and
the
wine
which
drank
and
that
they
should
nourished
three
years
that
the
end
thereof
they
should
stand
before
the
king
Daniel
Now
among
these
were
the
children
Judah
Daniel
Hananiah
Mishael
and
Azariah
Daniel
And
the
prince
the
eunuchs
gave
names
unto
them
unto
Daniel
gave
the
name
Belteshazzar
and
Hananiah
Shadrach
and
Mishael
Meshach
and
Azariah
Abed
nego
Daniel
But
Daniel
purposed
his
heart
that
would
not
defile
himself
with
the
king
dainties
nor
with
the
wine
which
drank
therefore
requested
the
prince
the
eunuchs
that
might
not
defile
himself
Daniel
Now
God
made
Daniel
find
kindness
and
compassion
the
sight
the
prince
the
eunuchs
Daniel
And
the
prince
the
eunuchs
said
unto
Daniel
fear
lord
the
king
who
hath
appointed
your
food
and
your
drink
for
why
should
see
your
faces
worse
looking
than
the
youths
that
are
your
own
age
would
endanger
head
with
the
king
Daniel
Then
said
Daniel
the
steward
whom
the
prince
the
eunuchs
had
appointed
over
Daniel
Hananiah
Mishael
and
Azariah
Daniel
Prove
thy
servants
beseech
thee
ten
days
and
let
them
give
pulse
eat
and
water
drink
Daniel
Then
let
our
countenances
looked
upon
before
thee
and
the
countenance
the
youths
that
eat
the
king
dainties
and
thou
seest
deal
with
thy
servants
Daniel
hearkened
unto
them
this
matter
and
proved
them
ten
days
Daniel
And
the
end
ten
days
their
countenances
appeared
fairer
and
they
were
fatter
flesh
than
all
the
youths
that
did
eat
the
king
dainties
Daniel
the
steward
took
away
their
dainties
and
the
wine
that
they
should
drink
and
gave
them
pulse
Daniel
Now
for
these
four
youths
God
gave
them
knowledge
and
skill
all
learning
and
wisdom
and
Daniel
had
understanding
all
visions
and
dreams
Daniel
And
the
end
the
days
which
the
king
had
appointed
for
bringing
them
the
prince
the
eunuchs
brought
them
before
Nebuchadnezzar
Daniel
And
the
king
communed
with
them
and
among
them
all
was
found
none
like
Daniel
Hananiah
Mishael
and
Azariah
therefore
stood
they
before
the
king
Daniel
And
every
matter
wisdom
and
understanding
concerning
which
the
king
inquired
them
found
them
ten
times
better
than
all
the
magicians
and
enchanters
that
were
all
his
realm
Daniel
And
Daniel
continued
even
unto
the
first
year
king
Cyrus
Daniel
And
the
second
year
the
reign
Nebuchadnezzar
Nebuchadnezzar
dreamed
dreams
and
his
spirit
was
troubled
and
his
sleep
went
from
him
Daniel
Then
the
king
commanded
call
the
magicians
and
the
enchanters
and
the
sorcerers
and
the
Chaldeans
tell
the
king
his
dreams
they
came
and
stood
before
the
king
Daniel
And
the
king
said
unto
them
have
dreamed
dream
and
spirit
troubled
know
the
dream
Daniel
Then
spake
the
Chaldeans
the
king
the
Syrian
language
king
live
for
ever
tell
thy
servants
the
dream
and
will
show
the
interpretation
Daniel
The
king
answered
and
said
the
Chaldeans
The
thing
gone
from
make
not
known
unto
the
dream
and
the
interpretation
thereof
shall
cut
pieces
and
your
houses
shall
made
dunghill
Daniel
But

the
dream
and
the
interpretation
thereof
shall
receive
gifts
and
rewards
and
great
honor
therefore
show
the
dream
and
the
interpretation
thereof
Daniel
They
answered
the
second
time
and
said
Let
the
king
tell
his
servants
the
dream
and
will
show
the
interpretation
Daniel
The
king
answered
and
said
know
certainty
that
would
gain
time
because
see
the
thing
gone
from
Daniel
But
make
not
known
unto
the
dream
there
but
one
law
for
you
for
have
prepared
lying
and
corrupt
words
speak
before
till
the
time
changed
therefore
tell
the
dream
and
shall
know
that
can
show
the
interpretation
thereof
Daniel
The
Chaldeans
answered
before
the
king
and
said
There
not
man
upon
the
earth
that
can
show
the
king
matter
forasmuch
king
lord
ruler
hath
asked
such
thing
any
magician
enchanter
Chaldean
Daniel
And
rare
thing
that
the
king
requireth
and
there
other
that
can
show
before
the
king
except
the
gods
whose
dwelling
not
with
flesh
Daniel
For
this
cause
the
king
was
angry
and
very
furious
and
commanded

all
the
wise
men
Babylon
Daniel
the
decree
went
forth
and
the
wise
men
were
slain
and
they
sought
Daniel
and
his
companions
slain
Daniel
Then
Daniel
returned

with
counsel
and
prudence
Arioch
the
captain
the
king
guard
who
was

Babylon
Daniel
The

spake
and
said
not
this
great
Babylon
which
have
built
for
the
royal
dwelling
place

and
for

Daniel
While
the
word
was
the
king
mouth
there
fell
voice
from
heaven
saying
king
Nebuchadnezzar
thee
spoken
The
kingdom
departed
from
thee
Daniel
and
thou
shalt
driven
from
men
and
they
dwelling

thou
shalt
made

and
seven
times
shall
pass
over
thee
until
thou
know
that
the
Most
High
ruleth
the
kingdom

and
giveth
whomsoever
will
Daniel
The
same
hour
was
the
thing
fulfilled
upon
Nebuchadnezzar
and
was
driven
from
men
and
did
eat
grass
oxen
and
his
body
was
wet
with
the
dew
heaven
till
his
hair
was
grown
like
eagles
feathers
and
his
nails
like
birds
claws
Daniel
And
the
end
the
days
Nebuchadnezzar
lifted
mine
eyes
unto
heaven
and
mine
understanding
returned
unto
and
blessed
the
Most
High
and
praised
and
honored
him
that
liveth
for
ever
for
his
dominion
everlasting

and
his

Daniel
and
all
the
inhabitants
the
earth
are
reputed
nothing
and
doeth
according
his
will
the
army
heaven
and
among
the
inhabitants
the
earth
and
none
can
stay
his
hand
say
unto
him
What
doest
thou
Daniel
the
same
time
mine
understanding
returned
unto
and
for
the
glory
kingdom
majesty
and
brightness
returned
unto
and
counsellors
and
lords
sought
unto
and
was
established
kingdom
and
excellent
greatness
was
added
unto
Daniel
Now
Nebuchadnezzar
praise
and
extol
and
honor
the
King

for
all
his
works
are
truth
and
his
ways

and
those

Daniel
Belshazzar
the
king
made
great
feast
thousand
his
lords
and
drank
wine
before
the
thousand
Daniel
Belshazzar
while
tasted
the
wine
commanded
bring
the
golden
and
silver
vessels
which
Nebuchadnezzar
his
father
had
taken
out
the
temple
which
was
Jerusalem
that
the
king
and
his
lords
his
wives
and
his
concubines
might
drink
therefrom
Daniel
Then
they
brought
the
golden
vessels
that
were
taken
out
the
temple
the
house
God
which
was
Jerusalem
and
the
king
and
his
lords
his
wives
and
his
concubines
drank
from
them
Daniel
They
drank
wine
and
praised
the
gods
gold
and
silver
brass
iron
wood
and
stone
Daniel
the
same
hour
came
forth
the
fingers
man
hand
and
wrote
over
against
the
candlestick
upon
the
plaster
the
wall
the
king
palace
and
the
king
saw
the
part
the
hand
that
wrote
Daniel
Then
the
king
countenance
was
changed
him
and
his
thoughts
troubled
him
and
the
joints
his
loins
were
loosed
and
his
knees
smote
one
against
another
Daniel
The
king
cried
aloud
bring
the
enchanters
the
Chaldeans
and
the
soothsayers
The
king
spake
and
said
the
wise
men
Babylon
Whosoever
shall
read
this
writing
and
show
the
interpretation
thereof
shall
clothed
with
purple
and
have
chain
gold
about
his
neck
and
shall
the
third
ruler
the
kingdom
Daniel
Then
came
all
the
king
wise
men
but
they
could
not
read
the
writing
nor
make
known
the
king
the
interpretation
Daniel
Then
was
king
Belshazzar
greatly
troubled
and
his
countenance
was
changed
him
and
his
lords
were
perplexed
Daniel
Now
the
queen
reason
the
words
the
king
and
his
lords
came
into
the
banquet
house
the
queen
spake
and
said
king
live
for
ever
let
not
thy
thoughts
trouble
thee
nor
let
thy
countenance
changed
Daniel
There
man
thy
kingdom
whom
the
spirit
the
holy
gods
and
the
days
thy
father
light
and
understanding
and
wisdom
like
the
wisdom
the
gods
were
found
him
and
the
king
Nebuchadnezzar
thy
father
the
king
say
thy
father
made
him
master
the
magicians
enchanters
Chaldeans
and
soothsayers
Daniel
forasmuch
excellent
spirit
and
knowledge
and
understanding
interpreting
dreams
and
showing
dark
sentences
and
dissolving
doubts
were
found
the
same
Daniel
whom
the
king
named
Belteshazzar
Now
let
Daniel
called
and
will
show
the
interpretation
Daniel
Then
was
Daniel
brought
before
the
king
The
king
spake
and
said
unto
Daniel
Art
thou
that
Daniel
who
art
the
children
the
captivity
Judah
whom
the
king
father
brought
out
Judah
Daniel
have
heard
thee
that
the
spirit
the
gods
thee
and
that
light
and
understanding
and
excellent
wisdom
are
found
thee
Daniel
And
now
the
wise
men
the
enchanters
have
been
brought
before
that
they
should
read
this
writing
and
make
known
unto
the
interpretation
thereof
but
they
could
not
show
the
interpretation
the
thing
Daniel
But
have
heard
thee
that
thou
canst
give
interpretations
and
dissolve
doubts
now
thou
canst
read
the
writing
and
make
known
the
interpretation
thereof
thou
shalt
clothed
with
purple
and
have
chain
gold
about
thy
neck
and
shalt
the
third
ruler
the
kingdom
Daniel
Then
Daniel
answered
and
said
before
the
king
Let
thy
gifts
thyself
and
give
thy
rewards
another
nevertheless
will
read
the
writing
unto
the
king
and
make
known
him
the
interpretation
Daniel
thou
king
the
Most
High
God
gave
Nebuchadnezzar
thy
father
the
kingdom
and
greatness
and
glory
and
majesty
Daniel
and
because
the
greatness
that
gave
him
all
the
peoples
nations
and
languages
trembled
and
feared
before
him
whom
would
slew
and
whom
would
kept
alive
and
whom
would
raised
and
whom
would
put
down
Daniel
But
when
his
heart
was
lifted
and
his
spirit
was
hardened
that
dealt
proudly
was
deposed
from
his
kingly
throne
and
they
took
his
glory
from
him
Daniel
and
was
driven
from
the
sons
men
and
his
heart
was
made
like
the
beasts
and
his
dwelling
was
with
the
wild
asses
was
fed
with
grass
like
oxen
and
his
body
was
wet
with
the
dew
heaven
until
knew
that
the
Most
High
God
ruleth
the
kingdom
men
and
that
setteth
over
whomsoever
will
Daniel
And
thou
his
son
Belshazzar
hast
not
humbled
thy
heart
though
thou
knewest
all
this
Daniel
but
hast
lifted
thyself
against
the
Lord
heaven
and
they
have
brought
the
vessels
his
house
before
thee
and
thou
and
thy
lords
thy
wives
and
thy
concubines
have
drunk
wine
from
them
and
thou
hast
praised
the
gods
silver
and
gold
brass
iron
wood
and
stone
which
see
not
nor
hear
nor
know
and
the
God
whose
hand
thy
breath
and
whose
are
all
thy
ways
hast
thou
not
glorified
Daniel
Then
was
the
part
the
hand
sent
from
before
him
and
this
writing
was
inscribed
Daniel
And
this
the
writing
that
was
inscribed
MENE
MENE
TEKEL
UPHARSIN
Daniel
This
the
interpretation
the
thing
MENE
God
hath
numbered
thy
kingdom
and
brought
end
Daniel
TEKEL
thou
art
weighed
the
balances
and
art
found
wanting
Daniel
PERES
thy
kingdom
divided
and
given
the
Medes
and
Persians
Daniel
Then
commanded
Belshazzar
and
they
clothed
Daniel
with
purple
and
put
chain
gold
about
his
neck
and
made
proclamation
concerning
him
that
should
the
third
ruler
the
kingdom
Daniel
that
night
Belshazzar
the
Chaldean
king
was
slain
Daniel
And
Darius
the
Mede
received
the
kingdom
being
about
threescore
and
two
years
old
Daniel
pleased
Darius
set
over
the
kingdom
hundred
and
twenty
satraps
who
should
throughout
the
whole
kingdom
Daniel
and
over
them
three
presidents
whom
Daniel
was
one
that
these
satraps
might
give
account
unto
them
and
that
the
king
should
have
damage
Daniel
Then
this
Daniel
was
distinguished
above
the
presidents
and
the
satraps
because
excellent
spirit
was
him
and
the
king
thought
set
him
over
the
whole
realm
Daniel
Then
the
presidents
and
the
satraps
sought
find
occasion
against
Daniel
touching
the
kingdom
but
they
could
find
occasion
nor
fault
forasmuch
was
faithful
neither
was
there
any
error
fault
found
him
Daniel
Then
said
these
men
shall
not
find
any
occasion
against
this
Daniel
except
find
against
him
concerning
the
law
his
God
Daniel
Then
these
presidents
and
satraps
assembled
together
the
king
and
said
thus
unto
him
King
Darius
live
for
ever
Daniel
All
the
presidents
the
kingdom
the
deputies
and
the
satraps
the
counsellors
and
the
governors
have
consulted
together
establish
royal
statute
and
make
strong
interdict
that
whosoever
shall
ask
petition
any
god
man
for
thirty
days
save
thee
king
shall
cast
into
the
den
lions
Daniel
Now
king
establish
the
interdict
and
sign
the
writing
that
not
changed
according
the
law
the
Medes
and
Persians
which
altereth
not
Daniel
Wherefore
king
Darius
signed
the
writing
and
the
interdict
Daniel
And
when
Daniel
knew
that
the
writing
was
signed
went
into
his
house
now
his
windows
were
open
his
chamber
toward
Jerusalem
and
kneeled
upon
his
knees
three
times
day
and
prayed
and
gave
thanks
before
his
God
did
aforetime
Daniel
Then
these
men
assembled
together
and
found
Daniel
making
petition
and
supplication
before
his
God
Daniel
Then
they
came
near
and
spake
before
the
king
concerning
the
king
interdict
Hast
thou
not
signed
interdict
that
every
man
that
shall
make
petition
unto
any
god
man
within
thirty
days
save
unto
thee
king
shall
cast
into
the
den
lions
The
king
answered
and
said
The
thing
true
according
the
law
the
Medes
and
Persians
which
altereth
not
Daniel
Then
answered
they
and
said
before
the
king
That
Daniel
who
the
children
the
captivity
Judah
regardeth
not
thee
king
nor
the
interdict
that
thou
hast
signed
but
maketh
his
petition
three
times
day
Daniel
Then
the
king
when
heard
these
words
was
sore
displeased
and
set
his
heart
Daniel
deliver
him
and
labored
till
the
going
down
the
sun
rescue
him
Daniel
Then
these
men
assembled
together
unto
the
king
and
said
unto
the
king
Know
king
that
law
the
Medes
and
Persians
that
interdict
nor
statute
which
the
king
establisheth
may
changed
Daniel
Then
the
king
commanded
and
they
brought
Daniel
and
cast
him
into
the
den
lions
Now
the
king
spake
and
said
unto
Daniel
Thy
God
whom
thou
servest
continually
will
deliver
thee
Daniel
And
stone
was
brought
and
laid
upon
the
mouth
the
den
and
the
king
sealed
with
his
own
signet
and
with
the
signet
his
lords
that
nothing
might
changed
concerning
Daniel
Daniel
Then
the
king
went
his
palace
and
passed
the
night
fasting
neither
were
instruments
music
brought
before
him
and
his
sleep
fled
from
him
Daniel
Then
the
king
arose
very
early
the
morning
and
went
haste
unto
the
den
lions
Daniel
And
when
came
near
unto
the
den
Daniel
cried
with
lamentable
voice
the
king
spake
and
said
Daniel
Daniel

the
living
God

God
whom
thou
servest
continually
able

thee
from
the
lions
Daniel
Then
said
Daniel
unto
the
king

for
ever
Daniel
God
hath
sent
his
angel
and
hath
shut
the
lions
mouths
and
they
have
not
hurt
forasmuch
before
him
innocency
was
found
and
also
before
thee
king
have
done
hurt
Daniel
Then
was
the
king
exceeding
glad
and
commanded
that
they
should
take
Daniel
out
the
den
Daniel
was
taken
out
the
den
and
manner
hurt
was
found
upon
him
because
had
trusted
his
God
Daniel
And
the
king
commanded
and
they
brought
those
men
that
had
accused
Daniel
and
they
cast
them
into
the
den
lions
them
their
children
and
their
wives
and
the
lions
had
the
mastery
them
and
brake
all
their
bones
pieces
before
they
came
the
bottom
the
den
Daniel
Then
king
Darius
wrote
unto
all
the
peoples
nations
and
languages
that

all
the
earth
Peace

Daniel
make

And
his
kingdom
that
which

and
his
dominion
shall

the
end
Daniel
delivereth
and
rescueth
and
worketh

and
wonders

and

the
Persian
Daniel
the
first
year
Belshazzar
king
Babylon
Daniel
had
dream
and
visions
his
head
upon
his
bed
then
wrote
the
dream
and
told
the
sum
the
matters
Daniel
Daniel
spake
and
said
saw
vision
night
and
behold
the
four
winds
heaven
brake
forth
upon
the
great
sea
Daniel
And
four
great
beasts
came
from
the
sea
diverse
one
from
another
Daniel
The
first
was
like
lion
and
had
eagle
wings
beheld
till
the
wings
thereof
were
plucked
and
was
lifted
from
the
earth
and
made
stand
upon
two
feet
man
and
man
heart
was
given
Daniel
And
behold
another
beast
second
like
bear
and
was
raised
one
side
and
three
ribs
were
its
mouth
between
its
teeth
and
they
said
thus
unto
Arise
devour
much
flesh
Daniel
After
this
beheld
and
another
like
leopard
which
had
upon
its
back
four
wings
bird
the
beast
had
also
four
heads
and
dominion
was
given
Daniel
After
this
saw
the
night
visions
and
behold
fourth
beast
terrible
and
powerful
and
strong
exceedingly
and
had
great
iron
teeth
devoured
and
brake
pieces
and
stamped
the
residue
with
its
feet
and
was
diverse
from
all
the
beasts
that
were
before
and
had
ten
horns
Daniel
considered
the
horns
and
behold
there
came
among
them
another
horn
little
one
before
which
three
the
first
horns
were
plucked
the
roots
and
behold
this
horn
were
eyes
like
the
eyes
man
and
mouth
speaking
great
things
Daniel
beheld
till
thrones
were
placed
and
one
that
was
ancient
days
did
sit
his
raiment
was
white
snow
and
the
hair
his
head
like
pure
wool
his
throne
was
fiery
flames
and
the
wheels
thereof
burning
fire
Daniel
fiery
stream
issued
and
came
forth
from
before
him
thousands
thousands
ministered
unto
him
and
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
stood
before
him
the
judgment
was
set
and
the
books
were
opened
Daniel
beheld
that
time
because
the
voice
the
great
words
which
the
horn
spake
beheld
even
till
the
beast
was
slain
and
its
body
destroyed
and
was
given
burned
with
fire
Daniel
And
for
the
rest
the
beasts
their
dominion
was
taken
away
yet
their
lives
were
prolonged
for
season
and
time
Daniel
saw
the
night
visions
and
behold
there
came
with
the
clouds
heaven
one
like
unto
son
man
and
came
even
the
ancient
days
and
they
brought
him
near
before
him
Daniel
And
there
was
given
him
dominion
and
glory
and
kingdom
that
all
the
peoples
nations
and
languages
should
serve
him
his
dominion
everlasting
dominion
which
shall
not
pass
away
and
his
kingdom
that
which
shall
not
destroyed
Daniel
for
Daniel
spirit
was
grieved
the
midst
body
and
the
visions
head
troubled
Daniel
came
near
unto
one
them
that
stood
and
asked
him
the
truth
concerning
all
this
told
and
made
know
the
interpretation
the
things
Daniel
These
great
beasts
which
are
four
are
four
kings
that
shall
arise
out
the
earth
Daniel
But
the
saints
the
Most
High
shall
receive
the
kingdom
and
possess
the
kingdom
for
ever
even
for
ever
and
ever
Daniel
Then
desired
know
the
truth
concerning
the
fourth
beast
which
was
diverse
from
all
them
exceeding
terrible
whose
teeth
were
iron
and
its
nails
brass
which
devoured
brake
pieces
and
stamped
the
residue
with
its
feet
Daniel
and
concerning
the
ten
horns
that
were
its
head
and
the
other
horn
which
came
and
before
which
three
fell
even
that
horn
that
had
eyes
and
mouth
that
spake
great
things
whose
look
was
more
stout
than
its
fellows
Daniel
beheld
and
the
same
horn
made
war
with
the
saints
and
prevailed
against
them
Daniel
until
the
ancient
days
came
and
judgment
was
given
the
saints
the
Most
High
and
the
time
came
that
the
saints
possessed
the
kingdom
Daniel
Thus
said
The
fourth
beast
shall
fourth
kingdom
upon
earth
which
shall
diverse
from
all
the
kingdoms
and
shall
devour
the
whole
earth
and
shall
tread
down
and
break
pieces
Daniel
And
for
the
ten
horns
out
this
kingdom
shall
ten
kings
arise
and
another
shall
arise
after
them
and
shall
diverse
from
the
former
and
shall
put
down
three
kings
Daniel
And
shall
speak
words
against
the
Most
High
and
shall
wear
out
the
saints
the
Most
High
and
shall
think
change
the
times
and
the
law

Daniel
was
left
alone
and

and
there
remained

was
turned
into
corruption
and
retained
strength
Daniel
Yet
heard
the
voice
his
words
and
when

then
was
fallen
into
deep
sleep
face

but
shall
stumble
and
fall
and

Then
shall
stand
his
place
one
that
shall
cause
exactor

through
the
glory

but
within

days
shall

And

And
the

And
after

scatter
among
them
prey

yea
shall
devise
his
devices
against

even
for
time
Daniel
And
shall
stir
his
power
and
his
courage
against
the
king
the
south
with
great
army
and
the
king
the
south
shall
war
battle
with
exceeding
great

Daniel
Yea
they
that

And
for

For

therefore
shall

and
shall
return
and
have
indignation
against
the
holy
covenant
and
shall
his
pleasure
shall
even
return
and
have
regard
unto
them
that
forsake
the
holy
covenant
Daniel
And
forces
shall
stand
his
part
and
they
shall
profane
the
sanctuary
even
the
fortress
and
shall
take
away
the
continual
burnt
offering
and
they
shall
set
the
abomination
that
maketh
desolate
Daniel
And
such
wickedly
against
the
covenant
shall
pervert
flatteries
but
the
people
that

their
God
shall

And
they
that

Daniel
Now
when
they
shall
fall
they
shall
helped
with
little
help
but
many
shall
join
themselves
unto
them
with
flatteries
Daniel
And
some
them
that

shall
fall
refine
them
and
purify
and
make

white
even
the

because
yet
for

Daniel
And
the
king
shall

his
will
and
shall
exalt
himself
and
magnify
himself
above
every
god
and
shall
speak
marvellous
things
against

gods
and
shall
prosper
till

indignation
accomplished
for

Daniel
Neither

regard
the
gods
his
fathers
nor
the

women
nor

Daniel
But
his
place

fortresses
and
god
whom
his
fathers
knew
not
shall
honor
with
gold

Daniel
And

whosoever

him
will
increase
with

and
shall
cause

Daniel
And
the
time
the
end
shall
the
king
the
south
contend
with
him
and
the
king
the
north
shall
come
against
him
like
whirlwind
with
chariots
and
with
horsemen
and
with
many
ships
and

Daniel
shall
stretch
forth
his

also
upon

and
the

Egypt
shall
not

Daniel
But

Egypt
and
the
Libyans
and
the
Ethiopians

But
tidings
out

east
and
out
the
north
shall
trouble
him
and
shall
forth
with
great
fury
destroy
and
utterly
sweep
away
many
Daniel
And
shall
plant
the
tents
his
palace
between
the
sea
and
the
glorious
holy
mountain
yet
shall
come
his
end
and
none
shall
help
him
Daniel
And
that
time
shall
Michael
stand
the
great
prince
who
standeth
for
the
children
thy
people
and
there
shall
time
trouble
such

there
was
nation
even
that
same
time
and
that
time
thy
people
shall

every
one
that
shall
found
written
the
book
Daniel
And
many
them
that
sleep
the
dust
the
earth
shall
awake
some
everlasting
life
and
some
shame
and
everlasting
contempt
Daniel
And
they
that
are
wise
shall
shine

firmament
and
they
that
turn

But
thou
Daniel
shut
the
words
and
seal
the
book
even
the
time
the
end
many
shall
run
and
fro
and
knowledge
shall
increased
Daniel
Then
Daniel
looked
and
behold
there
stood
other
two
the
one
the
brink
the
river
this
side
and
the
other
the
brink
the
river
that
side
Daniel
And
one
said
the
man
clothed
linen
who
was
above
the
waters
the
river
How
long
shall
the
end
these
wonders
Daniel
And
heard
the
man
clothed
linen
who
was
above
the
waters
the
river
when
held
his
right
hand
and
his
left
hand
unto
heaven
and
sware
him
that
liveth
for
ever
that

times
and
half
and
when
they
have
made
end
breaking
pieces
the
power
the
holy
people
all
these
things
shall
finished
Daniel
And
heard
but
understood
not
then
said
lord
what
shall

issue
these
things
Daniel
And
said
thy
way
Daniel
for
the
words
are
shut
and
sealed
till
the
time

end
Daniel
Many
shall
purify
themselves
and
make
themselves
white
and
refined
but
the
wicked
shall
wickedly
and
none
the
wicked
shall
understand
but
they
that
are
wise
shall
understand
Daniel
And
from
the
time
that
the
continual
burnt
offering
shall
taken
away
and
the
abomination
that
maketh
desolate
set
there
shall
thousand

Blessed

Daniel
But

for
thou
shalt

Hosea
The

Jehovah
that
came
unto
Hosea
the
son
Beeri
the
days
Uzziah
Jotham
Ahaz
and
Hezekiah
kings
Judah
and
the
days
Jeroboam
the
son
Joash
king
Israel
Hosea
When
Jehovah
spake
the
first
Hosea
Jehovah
said
unto
Hosea
take
unto
thee
wife
whoredom
and
children
whoredom
for
the
land
doth
commit
great
whoredom
departing
from
Jehovah
Hosea
went
and
took
Gomer
the
daughter
Diblaim
and
she
conceived
and
bare
him
son
Hosea
And
Jehovah
said
unto
him
Call
his
name
Jezreel
for
yet
little
while
and
will
avenge
the
blood
Jezreel
upon
the
house
Jehu
and
will
cause
the
kingdom
the
house
Israel
cease
Hosea
And
shall
come
pass
that
day
that
will
break
the
bow
Israel
the
valley
Jezreel
Hosea
And
she
conceived
again
and
bare
daughter
And
Jehovah
said
unto
him
Call
her
name
ruhamah
for
will
more
have
mercy
upon
the
house
Israel
that
should
any
wise
pardon
them
Hosea
But
will
have
mercy
upon
the
house
Judah
and
will
save
them
Jehovah
their
God
and
will
not
save
them
bow
nor
sword
nor
battle
horses
nor
horsemen
Hosea
Now
when
she
had
weaned
ruhamah
she
conceived
and
bare
son
Hosea
And
Jehovah
said
Call
his
name
ammi
for
are
not
people
and
will
not
your
God
Hosea
Yet
the
number
the
children
Israel
shall

sand
the
sea
which
cannot
measured
nor
numbered
and
shall
come
pass
that
the
place
where
was
said
unto
them
are
not
people
shall
said
unto
them
are
the
sons
the
living
God
Hosea
And
the
children
Judah
and
the
children
Israel
shall
gathered
together
and
they
shall
appoint
themselves
one
head
and
shall
from
the
land
for
great
shall
the
day
Jezreel
Hosea
Say
unto
your
brethren
Ammi
and
your
sisters
Ruhamah
Hosea
Contend
with
your
mother
contend
for
she
not
wife
neither
her
husband
and
let
her
put
away
her
whoredoms
from
her
face
and
her
adulteries
from
between
her
breasts
Hosea
lest
strip
her
naked
and
set
her
the
day
that
she
was
born
and
make
her
wilderness
and
set
her
like
dry
land
and
slay
her
with
thirst
Hosea
Yea
upon
her
children
will
have
mercy
for
they
are
children
whoredom
Hosea
for
their
mother
hath
played
the
harlot
she
that
conceived
them
hath
done
shamefully
for
she
said
will
after
lovers
that
give
bread
and
water
wool
and
flax
mine
oil
and
drink
Hosea
Therefore
behold
will
hedge
thy
way
with
thorns
and
will
build
wall
against
her
that
she
shall
not
find
her
paths
Hosea
And
she
shall
follow
after
her
lovers
but
she
shall
not
overtake
them
and
she
shall
seek
them
but
shall
not
find
them
then
shall
she
say
will
and
return
first
husband
for
then
was
better
with
than
now
Hosea
For
she
did
not
know
that
gave
her
the
grain
and
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
and
multiplied
unto
her
silver
and
gold
which
they
used
for
Baal
Hosea
Therefore
will
take
back
grain
the
time
thereof
and
new
wine
the
season
thereof
and
will
pluck
away
wool
and
flax
which
should
have
covered
her
nakedness
Hosea
And
now
will
uncover
her
lewdness
the
sight
her
lovers
and
none
shall
deliver
her
out
hand
Hosea
will
also
cause
all
her
mirth
cease
her
feasts
her
new
moons
and
her
sabbaths
and
all
her
solemn
assemblies
Hosea
And
will
lay
waste
her
vines
and
her
fig
trees
whereof
she
hath
said
These
are
hire
that
lovers
have
given
and
will
make
them
forest
and
the
beasts
the
field
shall
eat
them
Hosea
And
will
visit
upon
her
the
days
the
Baalim
unto
which
she
burned
incense
when
she
decked
herself
with
her
earrings
and
her
jewels
and
went
after
her
lovers
and
forgat
saith
Jehovah
Hosea
Therefore
behold
will
allure
her
and
bring
her
into
the
wilderness
and
speak
comfortably
unto
her
Hosea
And
will
give
her
her
vineyards
from
thence
and
the
valley
Achor
for
door
hope
and
she
shall
make
answer
there
the
days
her
youth
and
the
day
when
she
came
out
the
land
Egypt
Hosea
And
shall
that
day
saith
Jehovah
that
thou
shalt
call
Ishi
and
shalt
call
more
Baali
Hosea
For
will
take
away
the
names
the
Baalim
out
her
mouth
and
they
shall
more
mentioned
their
name
Hosea
And
that
day
will
make
covenant
for
them
with
the
beasts
the
field
and
with
the
birds
the
heavens
and
with
the
creeping
things
the
ground
and
will
break
the
bow
and
the
sword
and
the
battle
out
the
land
and
will
make
them
lie
down
safely
Hosea
And
will
betroth
thee
unto
for
ever
yea
will
betroth
thee
unto
righteousness
and
justice
and
lovingkindness
and
mercies
Hosea
will
even
betroth
thee
unto
faithfulness
and
thou
shalt
know
Jehovah
Hosea
And
shall
come
pass
that
day
will
answer
saith
Jehovah
will
answer
the
heavens
and
they
shall
answer
the
earth
Hosea
and
the
earth
shall
answer
the
grain
and
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
and
they
shall
answer
Jezreel
Hosea
And
will
sow
her
unto
the
earth
and
will
have
mercy
upon
her
that
had
not
obtained
mercy
and
will
say
them
that
were
not
people
Thou
art
people
and
they
shall
say
Thou
art
God
Hosea
And
Jehovah
said
unto
again
love
woman
beloved
her
friend
and
adulteress
even
Jehovah
loveth
the
children
Israel
though
they
turn
unto
other
gods
and
love
cakes
raisins
Hosea
bought
her
for
fifteen
pieces
silver
and
homer
barley
and
half
homer
barley
Hosea
and
said
unto
her
Thou
shalt
abide
for
many
days
thou
shalt
not
play
the
harlot
and
thou
shalt
not
any
man
wife
will
also
toward
thee
Hosea
For
the
children
Israel
shall
abide
many
days
without
king
and
without
prince
and
without
sacrifice
and
without
pillar
and
without
ephod
teraphim
Hosea
afterward
shall
the
children
Israel
return
and
seek
Jehovah
their
God
and
David
their
king
and
shall
come
with
fear
unto
Jehovah
and
his
goodness
the
latter
days
Hosea
Hear
the
word
Jehovah
children
Israel
for
Jehovah
hath
controversy
with
the
inhabitants
the
land
because
there
truth
nor
goodness
nor
knowledge
God
the
land
Hosea
There
nought
but
swearing
and
breaking
faith
and
killing
and
stealing
and
committing
adultery
they
break
out
and
blood
toucheth
blood
Hosea
Therefore
shall
the
land
mourn
and
every
one
that
dwelleth
therein
shall
languish
with
the
beasts
the
field
and
the
birds
the
heavens
yea
the
fishes
the
sea
also
shall
taken
away
Hosea
Yet
let
man
strive
neither
let
any
man
reprove
for
thy
people
are
they
that
strive
with
the
priest
Hosea
And
thou
shalt
stumble
the
day
and
the
prophet
also
shall
stumble
with
thee
the
night
and
will
destroy
thy
mother
Hosea
people
are
destroyed
for
lack
knowledge
because
thou
hast
rejected
knowledge
will
also
reject
thee
that
thou
shalt
priest
seeing
thou
hast
forgotten
the
law
thy
God
also
will
forget
thy
children
Hosea
they
were
multiplied
they
sinned
against
will
change
their
glory
into
shame
Hosea
They
feed
the
sin
people
and
set
their
heart
their
iniquity
Hosea
And
shall
like
people
like
priest
and
will
punish
them
for
their
ways
and
will
requite
them
their
doings
Hosea
And
they
shall
eat
and
not
have
enough
they
shall
play
the
harlot
and
shall
not
increase
because
they
have
left
off
taking
heed
Jehovah
Hosea
Whoredom
and
wine
and
new
wine
take
away
the
understanding
Hosea
people
ask
counsel
their
stock
and
their
staff
declareth
unto
them
for
the
spirit
whoredom
hath
caused
them
err
and
they
have
played
the
harlot
departing
from
under
their
God
Hosea
They
sacrifice
upon
the
tops
the
mountains
and
burn
incense
upon
the
hills
under
oaks
and
poplars
and
terebinths
because
the
shadow
thereof
good
therefore
your
daughters
play
the
harlot
and
your
brides
commit
adultery
Hosea
will
not
punish
your
daughters
when
they
play
the
harlot
nor
your
brides
when
they
commit
adultery
for
the
men
themselves
apart
with
harlots
and
they
sacrifice
with
the
prostitutes
and
the
people
that
doth
not
understand
shall
overthrown
Hosea
Though
thou
Israel
play
the
harlot
yet
let
not
Judah
offend
and
come
not
unto
Gilgal
neither
Beth
aven
nor
swear
Jehovah
liveth
Hosea
For
Israel
hath
behaved
himself
stubbornly
like
stubborn
heifer
now
will
Jehovah
feed
them
lamb
large

Hosea
Ephraim
joined
idols
let

Hosea
Their

they
play
the
harlot
continually
her
rulers
dearly
love
shame
Hosea
The
wind
hath
wrapped
her
its
wings
and
they
shall
put
shame
because
their

Hosea
Hear
this

and
hearken
house
Israel
and
give

house
the
king
for
unto
you
pertaineth
the
judgment
for
have
been

Mizpah
and

spread
upon
Tabor
Hosea
And
the
revolters
are
gone
deep
making
slaughter
but
rebuker
them
all

Ephraim
and
Israel
not
hid
from
for
now
Ephraim
thou
hast
played
the

Israel
defiled
Hosea
Their
doings
will
not
suffer
them
turn
unto
their
God
for
the
spirit
whoredom
within
them
and
they
know
not
Jehovah
Hosea
And
the
pride
Israel
doth
testify
his
face
therefore
Israel
and
Ephraim
shall
stumble
their
iniquity
Judah
also
shall
stumble
with
them
Hosea
They
shall
with
their
flocks
and
with
their
herds
seek
Jehovah
but

For

But

doth
testify

yet
they
have
not
returned
unto
Jehovah
their

Hosea
When

their

heard
Hosea
Woe
unto

yet
they
have
spoken
lies
against

And
they
have
not
cried

but
they
howl
upon
their

they
assemble
themselves
for
grain
and
new

they
rebel
against
Hosea
Though
have
taught
and
strengthened
their

yet
they
devise
mischief
against
Hosea
They
return
but
not
him
that

their

Hosea
They

their

Hosea

For

Hosea
for

eat
but
Jehovah
accepteth
them
not
now
will
remember
their
iniquity
and

they

Hosea
For
Israel
hath
forgotten
his
Maker

builded
palaces
and
Judah
hath
multiplied
fortified
cities
but

send
fire
upon
his
cities

Rejoice

Amos
The

The

forth
thousand

hundred
left
and
that
which

forth
hundred

For
thus
saith

unto

Seek

Amos
but
seek
not
Beth

Forasmuch

For

that
afflict
the

Therefore

Take

Amos
But
let

Amos
Did

Yea

Pass

Therefore

Amos
The

Amos
For

saith
Jehovah
the

and
they

Amos
Thus

after

Amos
And
came

Amos
Then
said
Lord
Jehovah
cease
beseech
thee
how
shall
Jacob
stand
for

Amos
Jehovah
repented
concerning
this
This
also
shall

saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
Amos
Thus
showed
and
behold
the
Lord
stood
beside
wall
made
plumb
line
with
plumb
line
his
hand
Amos
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Amos
what
seest
thou
And
said
plumb

Then
said
the
Lord
Behold

Amos
and

shall
desolate
and
the
sanctuaries
Israel
shall
laid
waste
and
will
rise
against
the
house
Jeroboam
with
the
sword
Amos
Then
Amaziah
the
priest
Beth
sent
Jeroboam
king
Israel
saying
Amos
hath
conspired
against
thee
the
midst
the
house
Israel
the
land
not

Amos
For
thus
Amos
saith
Jeroboam
shall
die

sword
and
Israel
shall
surely
led
away
captive
out

Amos
Also
Amaziah
said
unto
Amos
thou
seer
flee

away
into
the
land
Judah
and
there
eat
bread
and
prophesy
there
Amos
but
prophesy
not

more
Beth
for
the
king
sanctuary
and
royal
house
Amos
Then
answered
Amos
and
said
Amaziah
was
prophet
neither
was
prophet
son
but
was
herdsman
and
dresser
sycomore
trees
Amos
and
Jehovah
took
from
following
the
flock
and
Jehovah
said
unto
prophesy
unto
people
Israel
Amos
Now
therefore
hear
thou
the
word
Jehovah
Thou
sayest
Prophesy
not
against
Israel
and
drop
not
thy
word
against
the
house
Isaac
Amos
therefore
thus
saith
Jehovah
Thy
wife

harlot
the
city

thy
sons
and
thy
daughters

sword
and
thy

and
thou
thyself
shalt
die

unclean
and
Israel
shall

Amos
Thus
the
Lord
Jehovah
showed
and
behold
basket
summer
fruit
Amos
And
said
Amos
what
seest
thou
And
said
basket
summer
fruit
Then
said
Jehovah
unto
The

more
Amos
And
the
songs

saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
the
dead

they
cast
them
forth
with

Amos
Hear
this
that
would
swallow
the
needy
and
cause
the
poor
the
land
fail
Amos
saying
When

sell
grain
and
the
sabbath
that
may
set
forth
wheat
making
the
ephah
small
and
the
shekel
great
and
dealing
falsely
with
balances
deceit
Amos
that

buy
the
poor
for
silver
and
the
needy
for
pair
shoes
and
sell
the
refuse
the
wheat
Amos
Jehovah
hath
sworn
the
excellency
Jacob
Surely

never
forget
any
their
works
Amos
Shall
not
the
land
tremble
for
this
and
every

mourn
that
dwelleth
therein
yea
shall
rise
wholly
like
the
River
and

Amos
And

that
day
saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
that
will
cause
the
sun
down
noon
and
will
darken
the
earth
the
clear
day
Amos
And
will
turn
your
feasts
into
mourning
and
all
your
songs
into
lamentation
and
will
bring
sackcloth
upon
all
loins
and
baldness
upon
every
head
and
will
make
the
mourning
for

son
and
the
end
thereof
bitter

Amos
Behold
the

saith
the
Lord
Jehovah
that

Jehovah
Amos
And
they

sea
and
from
the
north
even
the
east
they
shall
run
and
fro
seek
the

Jehovah
and

Amos
that
day

the
fair
virgins
and
the
young

faint
for
thirst
Amos
They
that
swear
the

Samaria
and
say
thy
god
Dan
liveth
and
the
way
Beer
sheba
liveth
they
shall
fall
and
never
rise
again
Amos
saw
the
Lord
standing
beside
the
altar
and
said
Smite
the
capitals
that
the
thresholds
may
shake
and
break
them
pieces
the
head
all
them
and

slay
the
last
them
with
the
sword
there

not
one
them
flee
away
and
there
shall
not
one
them
escape
Amos
Though
they
dig
into
Sheol
thence

hand
take
them
and
though
they
climb
heaven
thence
will
bring
them
down
Amos
And
though
they
hide
themselves
the
top
Carmel
will
search
and
take
them
out
thence
and
though
they
hid
from
sight
the
bottom
the
sea
thence
will
command
the
serpent
and
shall
bite
them
Amos
And
though
they
into
captivity
before
their
enemies
thence
will
command
the
sword
and
shall
slay
them
and
will
set
mine
eyes
upon
them
for
evil
and
not
for

Amos
For
the
Lord
Jehovah
hosts

All

Behold

thou
art
greatly
despised

The

hath
deceived
thee
thou

Who

Though

will
bring

down
from
thence
saith

Obadiah
How
are
the
things
Esau
searched
how
are
his

treasures
sought
out
Obadiah
All
the

have
brought
thee

even

the

that
were

with
thee
have
deceived

Shall

Obadiah
For
the
violence
done
thy

Jacob
shame
shall
cover
thee
and
thou
shalt
cut
off
for
ever
Obadiah
the
day
that
thou
stoodest
the
other
side
the
day
that
strangers
carried
away
his
substance
and
foreigners
entered
into
his
gates
and
cast
lots
upon
Jerusalem
even
thou
wast
one
them
Obadiah
But
look
not

and
rejoice
not
over

Enter

For
the
day
Jehovah
near
upon
all
the
nations
thou
hast
done
shall
done
unto
thee
thy

shall
return
upon
thine

Obadiah
For

all
the
nations
drink
continually
yea
they
shall
drink
and
swallow
down
and
shall

But

And

shall
burn

and
there

And

And

Jehovah
Jonah
Now
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
Jonah
the
son
Amittai
saying
Jonah
Arise
Nineveh
that
great
city
and
cry
against
for
their
wickedness
come
before
Jonah
But
Jonah
rose
flee
unto
Tarshish
from
the
presence
Jehovah
and
went
down
Joppa
and
found
ship
going
Tarshish
paid
the
fare
thereof
and
went
down
into
with
them
unto
Tarshish
from
the
presence
Jehovah
Jonah
But
Jehovah
sent
out
great
wind
upon
the
sea
and
there
was
mighty
tempest
the
sea
that
the
ship
was
like
broken
Jonah
Then
the
mariners
were
afraid
and
cried
every
man
unto
his
god
and
they
cast
forth
the
wares
that
were
the
ship
into
the
sea
lighten
unto
them
But
Jonah
was
gone
down
into
the
innermost
parts
the
ship
and
lay
and
was
fast
asleep
Jonah
the
shipmaster
came
him
and
said
unto
him
What
meanest
thou
sleeper
arise
call
upon
thy
God
that
God
will
think
upon
that
perish
not
Jonah
And
they
said
every
one
his
fellow
Come
and
let
cast
lots
that
may
know
for
whose
cause
this
evil
upon
they
cast
lots
and
the
lot
fell
upon
Jonah
Jonah
Then
said
they
unto
him
Tell
pray
thee
for
whose
cause
this
evil
upon
what
thine
occupation
and
whence
comest
thou
what
thy
country
and
what
people
art
thou
Jonah
And
said
unto
them
Hebrew
and
fear
Jehovah
the
God
heaven
who
hath
made
the
sea
and
the
dry
land
Jonah
Then
were
the
men
exceedingly
afraid
and
said
unto
him
What
this
that
thou
hast
done
For
the
men
knew
that
was
fleeing
from
the
presence
Jehovah
because
had
told
them
Jonah
Then
said
they
unto
him
What
shall
unto
thee
that
the
sea
may
calm
unto
for
the
sea
grew
more
and
more
tempestuous
Jonah
And
said
unto
them
Take
and
cast
forth
into
the
sea
shall
the
sea
calm
unto
you
for
know
that
for
sake
this
great
tempest
upon
you
Jonah
Nevertheless
the
men
rowed
hard
get
them
back
the
land
but
they
could
not
for
the
sea
grew
more
and
more
tempestuous
against
them
Jonah
Wherefore
they
cried
unto
Jehovah
and
said
beseech
thee
Jehovah
beseech
thee
let
not
perish
for
this
man
life
and
lay
not
upon
innocent
blood
for
thou
Jehovah
hast
done
pleased
thee
Jonah
they
took
Jonah
and
cast
him
forth
into
the
sea
and
the
sea
ceased
from
its
raging
Jonah
Then
the
men
feared
Jehovah
exceedingly
and
they
offered
sacrifice
unto
Jehovah
and
made
vows
Jonah
And
Jehovah
prepared
great
fish
swallow
Jonah
and
Jonah
was
the
belly
the
fish
three
days
and
three
nights
Jonah
Then
Jonah
prayed
unto
Jehovah
his
God
out
the
fish
belly
Jonah
And
said
called
reason
mine
affliction
unto
Jehovah
And
answered
Out
the
belly
Sheol
cried
And
thou
heardest
voice
Jonah
For
thou
didst
cast
into
the
depth
the
heart
the
seas
And
the
flood
was
round
about
All
thy
waves
and
thy
billows
passed
over
Jonah
And
said
cast
out
from
before
thine
eyes
Yet
will
look
again
toward
thy
holy
temple
Jonah
The
waters
compassed
about
even
the
soul
The
deep
was
round
about
The
weeds
were
wrapped
about
head
Jonah
went
down
the
bottoms
the
mountains
The
earth
with
its
bars
closed
upon
for
ever
Yet
hast
thou
brought
life
from
the
pit
Jehovah
God
Jonah
When
soul
fainted
within
remembered
Jehovah
And
prayer
came
unto
thee
into
thy
holy
temple
Jonah
They
that
regard
lying
vanities
Forsake
their
own
mercy
Jonah
But
will
sacrifice
unto
thee
with
the
voice
thanksgiving
will
pay
that
which
have
vowed
Salvation
Jehovah
Jonah
And
Jehovah
spake
unto
the
fish
and
vomited
out
Jonah
upon
the
dry
land
Jonah
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
Jonah
the
second
time
saying
Jonah
Arise
unto
Nineveh
that
great
city
and
preach
unto
the
preaching
that
bid
thee
Jonah
Jonah
arose
and
went
unto
Nineveh
according
the
word
Jehovah
Now
Nineveh
was
exceeding
great
city
three
days
journey
Jonah
And
Jonah
began
enter
into
the
city
day
journey
and
cried
and
said
Yet
forty
days
and
Nineveh
shall
overthrown
Jonah
And
the
people
Nineveh
believed
God
and
they
proclaimed
fast
and
put
sackcloth
from
the
greatest
them
even
the
least
them
Jonah
And
the
tidings
reached
the
king
Nineveh
and
arose
from
his
throne
and
laid
his
robe
from
him
and
covered
him
with
sackcloth
and
sat
ashes
Jonah
And
made
proclamation
and
published
through
Nineveh
the
decree
the
king
and
his
nobles
saying
Let
neither
man
nor
beast
herd
nor
flock
taste
anything
let
them
not
feed
nor
drink
water
Jonah
but
let
them
covered
with
sackcloth
both
man
and
beast
and
let
them
cry
mightily
unto
God
yea
let
them
turn
every
one
from
his
evil
way
and
from
the
violence
that
his
hands
Jonah
Who
knoweth
whether
God
will
not
turn
and
repent
and
turn
away
from
his
fierce
anger
that
perish
not
Jonah
And
God
saw
their
works
that
they
turned
from
their
evil
way
and
God
repented
the
evil
which
said
would
unto
them
and
did
not
Jonah
But
displeased
Jonah
exceedingly
and
was
angry
Jonah
And
prayed
unto
Jehovah
and
said
pray
thee
Jehovah
was
not
this
saying
when
was
yet
country
Therefore
hasted
flee
unto
Tarshish
for
knew
that
thou
art
gracious
God
and
merciful
slow
anger
and
abundant
lovingkindness
and
repentest
thee
the
evil
Jonah
Therefore
now
Jehovah
take
beseech
thee
life
from
for
better
for
die
than
live
Jonah
And
Jehovah
said
Doest
thou
well
angry
Jonah
Then
Jonah
went
out
the
city
and
sat
the
east
side
the
city
and
there
made
him
booth
and
sat
under
the
shade
till
might
see
what
would
become
the
city
Jonah
And
Jehovah
God
prepared
gourd
and
made
come
over
Jonah
that
might
shade
over
his
head
deliver
him
from
his
evil
case
Jonah
was
exceeding
glad
because
the
gourd
Jonah
But
God
prepared
worm
when
the
morning
rose
the
next
day
and
smote
the
gourd
that
withered
Jonah
And
came
pass
when
the
sun
arose
that
God
prepared
sultry
east
wind
and
the
sun
beat
upon
the
head
Jonah
that
fainted
and
requested
for
himself
that
might
die
and
said
better
for
die
than
live
Jonah
And
God
said
Jonah
Doest
thou
well
angry
for
the
gourd
And
said
well
angry
even
unto
death
Jonah
And
Jehovah
said
Thou
hast
had
regard
for
the
gourd
for
which
thou
hast
not
labored
neither
madest
grow
which
came
night
and
perished
night
Jonah
and
should
not
have
regard
for
Nineveh
that
great
city
wherein
are
more
than
sixscore
thousand
persons
that
cannot
discern
between
their
right
hand
and
their
left
hand
and
also
much
cattle
Micah

What

Therefore

Then

yea
will
hide
his

Thus
saith

Peace

Israel
that
abhor

Micah
They
build
Zion

iniquity
Micah
The

ariseth
they
flee
away
and
their
place
not
known
where
they
are
Nahum
Thy
shepherds
slumber
king
Assyria
thy
nobles
are
rest
thy
people
are
scattered
upon
the
mountains
and
there
none
gather
them
Nahum
There
assuaging
thy
hurt
thy
wound
grievous
all
that
hear
the
report
thee
clap
their
hands
over
thee
for
upon
whom
hath
not
thy
wickedness
passed
continually
Habakkuk
The
burden
which
Habakkuk
the
prophet
did
see
Habakkuk
Jehovah
how
long
shall
cry
and
thou
wilt
not
hear
cry
out
unto
thee
violence
and
thou
wilt
not
save
Habakkuk
Why
dost
thou
show
iniquity
and
look
upon
perverseness
for
destruction
and
violence
are
before
and
there
strife
and
contention
riseth
Habakkuk
Therefore
the
law
slacked
and
justice
doth
never
forth
for
the
wicked
doth
compass
about
the
righteous
therefore
justice
goeth
forth
perverted
Habakkuk
Behold
among
the
nations
and
look
and
wonder
marvellously
for
working
work
your
days
which
will
not
believe
though
told
you
Habakkuk
For
raise
the
Chaldeans
that
bitter
and
hasty
nation
that
march
through
the
breadth
the
earth
possess
dwelling
places
that
are
not
theirs
Habakkuk
They
are
terrible
and
dreadful
their
judgment
and
their
dignity
proceed
from
themselves
Habakkuk
Their
horses
also
are
swifter
than
leopards
and
are
more
fierce
than
the
evening
wolves
and
their
horsemen
press
proudly
yea
their
horsemen
come
from
far
they
fly
eagle
that
hasteth
devour
Habakkuk
They
come
all
them
for
violence
the
set
their
faces
forwards
and
they
gather
captives
the
sand
Habakkuk
Yea
scoffeth
kings
and
princes
are
derision
unto
him
derideth
every
stronghold
for
heapeth
dust
and
taketh
Habakkuk
Then
shall
sweep
wind
and
shall
pass
over
and
guilty
even
whose
might
his
god
Habakkuk
Art
not
thou
from
everlasting
Jehovah
God
Holy
One
shall
not
die
Jehovah
thou
hast
ordained
him
for
judgment
and
thou
Rock
hast
established
him
for
correction
Habakkuk
Thou
that
art
purer
eyes
than
behold
evil
and
that
canst
not
look
perverseness
wherefore
lookest
thou
upon
them
that
deal
treacherously
and
holdest
thy
peace
when
the
wicked
swalloweth
the
man
that
more
righteous
than
Habakkuk
and
makest
men
the
fishes
the
sea
the
creeping
things
that
have
ruler
over
them
Habakkuk
taketh
all
them
with
the
angle
catcheth
them
his
net
and
gathereth
them
his
drag
therefore
rejoiceth
and
glad
Habakkuk
Therefore
sacrificeth
unto
his
net
and
burneth
incense
unto
his
drag
because
them
his
portion
fat
and
his
food
plenteous
Habakkuk
Shall
therefore
empty
his
net
and
spare
not
slay
the
nations
continually
Habakkuk
will
stand
upon
watch
and
set
upon
the
tower
and
will
look
forth
see
what
will
speak
with
and
what
shall
answer
concerning
complaint
Habakkuk
And
Jehovah
answered
and
said
Write
the
vision
and
make
plain
upon
tablets
that
may
run
that
readeth
Habakkuk
For
the
vision
yet
for
the
appointed
time
and
hasteth
toward
the
end
and
shall
not
lie
though
tarry
wait
for
because
will
surely
come
will
not
delay
Habakkuk
Behold
his
soul
puffed
not
upright
him
but
the
righteous
shall
live
his
faith
Habakkuk
Yea
moreover
wine
treacherous
haughty
man
that
keepeth
not
home
who
enlargeth
his
desire
Sheol
and
death
and
cannot
satisfied
but
gathereth
unto
him
all
nations
and
heapeth
unto
him
all
peoples
Habakkuk
Shall
not
all
these
take
parable
against
him
and
taunting
proverb
against
him
and
say
Woe
him
that
increaseth
that
which
not
his
how
long
and
that
ladeth
himself
with
pledges
Habakkuk
Shall
they
not
rise
suddenly
that
shall
bite
thee
and
awake
that
shall
vex
thee
and
thou
shalt
for
booty
unto
them
Habakkuk
Because
thou
hast
plundered
many
nations
all
the
remnant
the
peoples
shall
plunder
thee
because
men

and
for
the
violence
done
the

the

and
all
that
dwell
therein
Habakkuk
Woe
him
that
getteth
evil
gain
for
his
house
that
may
set
his
nest
high
that
may
delivered
from
the
hand
evil
Habakkuk
Thou
hast
devised
shame
thy
house
cutting
off
many
peoples
and
hast
sinned
against
thy
soul
Habakkuk
For
the
stone
shall
cry
out
the
wall
and
the
beam
out
the
timber
shall
answer
Habakkuk
Woe
him
that
buildeth
town
with
blood
and
establisheth
city
iniquity
Habakkuk
Behold
not
Jehovah
hosts
that
the
peoples
labor
for
the
fire
and
the
nations
weary
themselves
for
vanity
Habakkuk
For
the
earth
shall
filled
with
the
knowledge
the
glory
Jehovah
the
waters
cover
the
sea
Habakkuk
Woe
unto
him
that
giveth
his
neighbor
drink
thee
that
addest
thy
venom
and
makest
him
drunken
also
that
thou
mayest

Habakkuk
Thou

filled
with
shame
and
not

also
and

uncircumcised
the

Jehovah
right

shall
come

thee
and

Habakkuk
For
the

because

What

Behold

And
the

Habakkuk
And
his
brightness
was

had
rays
coming
forth
from
his

And
there
was
the
hiding
his
power
Habakkuk
Before
him
went
the
pestilence
And
fiery
bolts
went
forth

feet
Habakkuk
stood
and
measured
the

beheld
and
drove
asunder
the

And
the
eternal

The

His

Habakkuk
saw
the

Cushan
affliction
The

Midian
did

Habakkuk
Was
Jehovah
displeased
with

That

Habakkuk
Thy

The

Selah
Thou
didst
cleave
the

Habakkuk
The

saw
thee
and
were

The

The

And

Habakkuk
The

For

Laying

Because

And

Zechariah
And

Then

Then

saying

Moreover

Zechariah
Then

said
unto
him
What

two
olive
trees
upon
the
right

Zechariah
And

Zechariah
And
answered
and
said

are
And
said
lord
Zechariah
Then
said
These
are

Zechariah
Then

Then
said
unto

face
the
whole
land
for
every

that
stealeth
shall

side
according
and
every

that
sweareth
shall
cut
off
the

side
according
Zechariah
will
cause

and
shall
enter
into
the
house

and
shall
abide
the
midst
his
house
and
shall
consume

thereof
and

Zechariah
Then
the
angel
that
talked
with
went
forth
and
said
unto
Lift

And

And

and
cast
her
down
into
the

thereof
Zechariah
Then
lifted

Then

And

And

Then

And

yea

and
speak
unto

saying
Thus

and

and

and

And
this

will
diligently
obey
the

Zechariah
And
came
pass
the
fourth
year
king
Darius
that
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
Zechariah
the
fourth
day
the
ninth
month
even
Chislev
Zechariah
Now
they
Beth
had
sent
Sharezer
and
Regem
melech
and
their
men
entreat
the
favor
Jehovah
Zechariah
and
speak
unto
the
priests
the
house
Jehovah
hosts
and
the
prophets
saying
Should
weep
the
fifth
month
separating
myself
have
done
these
many
years
Zechariah
Then
came
the
word
Jehovah
hosts
unto
saying
Zechariah
Speak
unto
all
the
people
the
land
and
the
priests
saying
When
fasted
and
mourned
the
fifth
and
the
seventh
month
even
these
seventy
years
did
all
fast
unto
even
Zechariah
And
when
eat
and
when
drink
not
eat
for
yourselves
and
drink
for
yourselves
Zechariah
Should
not
hear
the
words
which
Jehovah
cried
the
former
prophets
when
Jerusalem
was
inhabited
and
prosperity
and
the
cities
thereof
round
about
her
and
the
South
and
the
lowland
were
inhabited
Zechariah
And
the
word
Jehovah
came
unto
Zechariah
saying
Zechariah
Thus
hath
Jehovah
hosts
spoken
saying
Execute
true
judgment
and
show
kindness
and
compassion
every
man
his
brother
Zechariah
and
oppress
not
the
widow
nor
the
fatherless
the
sojourner
nor
the
poor
and
let
none
you
devise
evil
against
his
brother
your
heart
Zechariah
But
they
refused
hearken
and
pulled
away
the
shoulder
and
stopped
their
ears
that
they
might
not
hear
Zechariah
Yea
they
made
their
hearts
adamant
stone
lest
they
should
hear
the
law
and
the
words
which
Jehovah
hosts
had
sent
his
Spirit
the
former
prophets
therefore
there
came
great
wrath
from
Jehovah
hosts
Zechariah
And
come
pass
that
cried
and
they
would
not
hear
they
shall
cry
and
will
not
hear
said
Jehovah
hosts
Zechariah
but
will
scatter
them
with
whirlwind
among
all
the
nations
which
they
have
not
known
Thus
the
land
was
desolate
after
them
that
man
passed
through
nor
returned
for
they
laid
the
pleasant
land
desolate
Zechariah
And
the
word
Jehovah
hosts
came
saying
Zechariah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
jealous
for
Zion
with
great
jealousy
and
jealous
for
her
with
great
wrath
Zechariah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
returned
unto
Zion
and
will
dwell
the
midst
Jerusalem
and
Jerusalem
shall
called
The
city
truth
and
the
mountain
Jehovah
hosts
The
holy
mountain
Zechariah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
There
shall
yet
old
men
and
old
women
dwell
the
streets
Jerusalem
every
man
with
his
staff
his
hand
for
very
age
Zechariah
And
the
streets
the
city
shall
full
boys
and
girls
playing
the
streets
thereof
Zechariah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
marvellous
the
eyes
the

this
people
those
days
should

marvellous
mine

saith
Jehovah
hosts
Zechariah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Behold

the
east
country
and
from
the
west
country
Zechariah
and
will
bring
them
and
they
shall
dwell
the
midst
Jerusalem
and
they
shall

Zechariah
Thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Let

these
days
these
words
from
the
mouth
the
prophets
that
were
the
day
that
the
foundation
the
house
Jehovah
hosts
was
laid
even
the
temple
that
might
built
Zechariah
For
before
those
days
there
was
hire
for
man
nor
any
hire
for
beast
neither
was
there
any
peace
him
that
went
out
came
because
the
adversary
for
set
all
men
every

against
his
neighbor
Zechariah
But
now

this
people

saith
Jehovah
hosts
Zechariah
For
there
shall
the

vine
shall
give
its
fruit
and
the
ground
shall
give
its
increase
and
the
heavens
shall
give
their
dew
and
will
cause
the
remnant
this
people

all
these
things
Zechariah
And
shall
come
pass
that

Judah
and
house
Israel

save
you
and
shall
blessing
Fear

but
let

Zechariah
For
thus
saith
Jehovah
hosts
thought
evil

you
when
your
fathers
provoked

saith
Jehovah
hosts
and
repented

Zechariah
again

the
things
that

Speak

Zechariah
and
let
none
you

evil
your
hearts
against
his

and
love
false

for
all
these
are
things
that

Jehovah
Zechariah
And
the

Thus

Zechariah
Thus
said
Jehovah
God
Feed
the

slaughter
Zechariah
whose
possessors
slay
them
and
hold
themselves
not
guilty
and
they
that
sell
them
say
Blessed
Jehovah
for
rich
and
their
own
shepherds
pity
them
not
Zechariah
For
will
more
pity
the
inhabitants
the
land
saith
Jehovah
but
will
deliver
the
men
every
one
into
his
neighbor
hand
and
into
the
hand
his
king
and
they
shall
smite
the
land
and
out
their
hand
will
not
deliver
them
Zechariah
fed
the
flock
slaughter
verily
the
poor
the
flock
And
took
unto
two
staves
the
one
called
Beauty
and
the
other
called
Bands
and
fed
the
flock
Zechariah
And
cut
off
the
three
shepherds
one
month
for
soul
was
weary
them
and
their
soul
also
loathed
Zechariah
Then
said
will
not
feed
you
that
which
dieth
let
die
and
that
which
cut
off
let
cut
off
and
let
them
that
are
left
eat
every
one
the
flesh
another
Zechariah
And
took
staff
Beauty
and
cut
asunder
that
might
break
covenant
which
had
made
with
all
the
peoples
Zechariah
And
was
broken
that
day
and
thus
the
poor
the
flock
that
gave
heed
unto
knew
that
was
the
word
Jehovah
Zechariah
And
said
unto
them
think
good
give
hire
and
not
forbear
they
weighed
for
hire
thirty
pieces
silver
Zechariah
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Cast
unto
the
potter
the
goodly
price
that
was
prized
them
And
took
the
thirty
pieces
silver
and
cast
them
unto
the
potter
the
house
Jehovah
Zechariah
Then
cut
asunder
mine
other
staff
even
Bands
that
might
break
the
brotherhood
between
Judah
and
Israel
Zechariah
And
Jehovah
said
unto
Take
unto
thee
yet
again
the
instruments
foolish
shepherd
Zechariah
For
will
raise
shepherd
the
land
who
will
not
visit
those
that
are
cut
off
neither
will
seek
those
that
are
scattered
nor
heal
that
which
broken
nor
feed
that
which
sound
but
will
eat
the
flesh
the
fat
sheep
and
will
tear
their
hoofs
pieces
Zechariah
Woe
the
worthless
shepherd
that
leaveth
the
flock
the
sword
shall
upon
his
arm
and
upon
his
right
eye
his
arm
shall
clean
dried
and
his
right
eye
shall
utterly
darkened
Zechariah
The
burden
the
word
Jehovah
concerning
Israel
Thus
saith
Jehovah
who
stretcheth
forth
the
heavens
and
layeth
the
foundation
the
earth
and
formeth
the
spirit
man
within
him
Zechariah
Behold
will
make
Jerusalem
cup
reeling

all
the
peoples
round
about
and
upon
Judah
also
shall

Jerusalem
Zechariah
And
shall
come
pass
that
day
that
will
make
Jerusalem
burdensome
stone
for
all
the
peoples
all
that
burden
themselves
with
shall
sore
wounded
and
all
the
nations
the
earth
shall
gathered
together
against
Zechariah
that
day
saith
Jehovah
will
smite
every
horse
with
terror
and
his
rider
with
madness
and
will
open
mine
eyes
upon
the
house
Judah
and
will
smite
every
horse
the
peoples
with
blindness
Zechariah
And
the
chieftains
Judah
shall
say
their
heart
The
inhabitants
Jerusalem
are
strength
Jehovah
hosts
their
God
Zechariah
that
day
will
make
the
chieftains
Judah
like
pan
fire
among
wood
and
like
flaming
torch
among
sheaves
and
they
shall
devour
all
the
peoples
round
about
the
right
hand
and
the
left
and
they
Jerusalem
shall
yet
again
dwell
their
own
place
even
Jerusalem
Zechariah
Jehovah
also
shall
save
the
tents
Judah
first
that
the
glory
the
house
David
and
the
glory
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
not
magnified
above
Judah
Zechariah
that
day
shall
Jehovah
defend
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
and
that
feeble
among
them
that
day

the
house
David

Zechariah
And
shall
come

that
day
that
will
seek
destroy
all
the
nations
that
come
against
Jerusalem
Zechariah
And
will
pour
upon
the
house
David
and
upon
the
inhabitants
Jerusalem
the
spirit
grace
and
supplication
and
they
shall
look
unto
whom
they
have
pierced
and

mourn
for
him

for
his

For

And
now

this
commandment
for

Malachi
will
not
hear
and
will
not
lay
heart
give
glory
unto

The

truth
was
his
mouth
and
unrighteousness
was
not
found
his
lips
walked
with
peace
and
uprightness
and
turned
many
away
from
iniquity
Malachi
For
the
priest
lips
should
keep
knowledge
and
they
should
seek
the
law
his
mouth
for
the
messenger
Jehovah
hosts
Malachi
But
are
turned
aside
out
the
way
have
caused
many
stumble
the
law
have
corrupted
the
covenant
Levi
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Malachi
Therefore
have
also
made
you
contemptible
and
base
before
all
the
people
according
have
not
kept
ways
but
have
had
respect
persons
the

Malachi
Have
not
all
one
father
hath
not
one
God
created
why
deal
treacherously
every
man
against
his
brother
profaning
the
covenant
our
fathers
Malachi
Judah
hath
dealt
treacherously
and
abomination
committed
Israel
and
Jerusalem
for
Judah
hath
profaned
the
holiness
Jehovah
which
loveth
and
hath
married
the
daughter
foreign
god
Malachi
Jehovah
will
cut
off
the
man
that
doeth
this
him
that
waketh
and
him
that
answereth
out
the
tents
Jacob
and
him
that
offereth
offering
unto
Jehovah
hosts
Malachi
And
this
again
cover

altar
Jehovah
with
tears
with
weeping
and
with
sighing
insomuch
that
regardeth
not
the
offering
any
more
neither
receiveth
with
good
will
your
hand
Malachi
Yet
say
Wherefore
Because
Jehovah
hath
been
witness
between
thee
and
the
wife
thy
youth
against
whom
thou
hast
dealt
treacherously
though
she
thy
companion
and
the
wife
thy
covenant
Malachi
And
did
not
make
one
although
had
the
residue
the
Spirit
And
wherefore
one
sought
godly
seed
Therefore
take
heed
your
spirit
and
let
none
deal
treacherously
against
the
wife
his
youth
Malachi
For
hate
putting
away
saith
Jehovah
the
God
Israel
and
him
that
covereth
his
garment
with
violence
saith
Jehovah
hosts
therefore
take
heed
your
spirit
that
deal
not
treacherously
Malachi
have
wearied
Jehovah
with
your
words
Yet
say
Wherein
have
wearied
him
that
say
Every
one
that
doeth
evil
good
the
sight
Jehovah
and
delighteth
them
where
the
God
justice
Malachi
Behold
send
messenger
and
shall
prepare
the
way
before
and
the
Lord
whom
seek
will
suddenly
come

temple
and
the
messenger
the
covenant
whom
desire
behold
cometh
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Malachi
But
who
can
abide
the
day
his
coming
and
who
shall
stand
when
appeareth
for
like
refiner
fire
and
like
fullers
soap
Malachi
and
will
sit
refiner
and
purifier
silver
and
will
purify
the
sons
Levi
and
refine
them
gold
and
silver
and
they
shall
offer
unto
Jehovah
offerings
righteousness
Malachi
Then
shall
the
offering
Judah
and
Jerusalem
pleasant
unto
Jehovah
the
days
old
and
ancient
years
Malachi
And
will
come
near
you
judgment
and
will
swift
witness
against
the
sorcerers
and
against
the
adulterers
and
against
the
false
swearers
and
against
those
that
oppress
the
hireling
his
wages
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
and
that
turn
aside
the
sojourner
from
his
right
and
fear
not
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Malachi
For
Jehovah
change
not
therefore
sons
Jacob
are
not
consumed
Malachi
From
the
days
your
fathers
have
turned
aside
from
mine
ordinances
and
have
not
kept
them
Return
unto
and
will
return
unto
you
saith
Jehovah
hosts
But
say
Wherein
shall
return
Malachi
Will
man
rob
God
yet
rob
But
say
Wherein
have
robbed
thee
tithes
and
offerings
Malachi
are
cursed
with
the
curse
for
rob
even
this
whole
nation
Malachi
Bring
the
whole
tithe
into
the
store
house
that
there
may
food
house
and
prove
now
herewith
saith
Jehovah
hosts
will
not
open
you
the
windows
heaven
and
pour
you
out
blessing
that
there
shall
not
room
enough
receive
Malachi
And
will
rebuke
the
devourer
for
your
sakes
and
shall
not
destroy
the
fruits
your
ground
neither
shall
your
vine
cast
its
fruit
before
the
time
the
field
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Malachi
And
all
nations
shall
call
you
happy
for
shall
delightsome
land
saith
Jehovah
hosts
Malachi
Your
words
have
been
stout
against
saith
Jehovah
Yet
say
What
have
spoken
against
thee
Malachi
have
said
vain
serve
God
and
what
profit
that
have
kept
his
charge
and
that
have
walked
mournfully
before
Jehovah
hosts
Malachi
and
now
call
the
proud
happy
yea
they
that
work
wickedness
are
built
yea
they
tempt
God
and
escape
Malachi
Then
they
that
feared
Jehovah
spake
one
with
another
and
Jehovah
hearkened
and
heard
and
book
remembrance
was
written
before
him
for
them
that
feared
Jehovah
and
that
thought
upon
his
name
Malachi
And
they
shall
mine
saith
Jehovah
hosts
even
mine
own
possession
the
day
that
make
and
will
spare
them
man
spareth
his
own
son
that
serveth
him
Malachi
Then
shall
return
and
discern
between
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
between
him
that
serveth
God
and
him
that
serveth
him
not
Malachi
For
behold
the
day
cometh
burneth
furnace
and
all
the
proud
and
all
that
work
wickedness
shall
stubble
and
the
day
that
cometh
shall
burn
them
saith
Jehovah
hosts
that
shall
leave
them
neither
root
nor
branch
Malachi
But
unto
you
that
fear
name
shall
the
sun
righteousness
arise
with
healing
its
wings
and
shall
forth
and
gambol
calves
the
stall
Malachi
And
shall
tread
down
the
wicked
for
they
shall
ashes
under
the
soles
your

the
day
that

saith
Jehovah

Malachi
Remember
the

Malachi
Behold
will
send
you
Elijah
the

before
the
great
and
terrible
day
Jehovah
come
Malachi
And
shall
turn
the
heart
the

the

lest
come

Now
the

she
was

And

But
when

And

and
thou
shalt
call

for

from

Matthew
Now
all
this
come
pass
that

and

For

Matthew
Then
Herod
privily

And

Matthew
And
being
warned
God
dream
that
they

And

Then

Moreover

Verily

But

Lay

Matthew
Behold

And

Matthew
And

Consider

Matthew
yet

But

For

But

And
why

Matthew
how

Matthew
Thou

Give

Ask

All

Matthew
Enter

the
gate
and
broad
the
way
that

destruction
and
many
are
they
that

Matthew
For
narrow
the
gate
and
straitened
the
way
that
leadeth
unto
life
and
few
are
they
that

Matthew
Beware
false

ravening
wolves
Matthew
their
fruits
shall
know

men
gather
grapes
thorns
figs
thistles
Matthew
Even
every
good
tree
bringeth
forth
good
fruit
but
the

evil
fruit
Matthew
good

cannot
bring

Matthew
Every

that

hewn
down

Matthew
Therefore
their
fruits
shall
know

Matthew
Not
every

saith
unto
Lord

Many
will
say
that

Lord
Lord
did
not
prophesy
thy
name
and
thy

and
thy

many
mighty
works
Matthew
And
then
will
profess
unto
them
never
knew
you
depart
from
that
work
iniquity
Matthew
Every
one
therefore
that
heareth
these
words
mine
and
doeth
them
shall
likened
unto
wise
man
who
built
his
house
upon
the
rock
Matthew
and
the
rain
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
beat
upon
that
house
and
fell
not
for
was
founded
upon
the
rock
Matthew
And
every
one
that
heareth
these
words
mine
and
doeth
them
not
shall
likened
unto
foolish
man
who
built
his
house
upon
the
sand
Matthew
and
the
rain
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
smote
upon
that
house
and
fell
and
great
was
the
fall
thereof
Matthew
And
came
pass
when
Jesus
had
finished
these
words
the
multitudes
were
astonished
his
teaching
Matthew
for
taught
them
one
having
authority
and
not
their
scribes
Matthew
And
when
was
come
down
from
the
mountain
great
multitudes
followed
him
Matthew
And
behold
there
came
him
leper
and
worshipped
him
saying
Lord
thou
wilt
thou
canst
make
clean
Matthew
And
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
touched
him
saying
will
thou
made
clean
And
straightway
his
leprosy
was
cleansed
Matthew
And
Jesus
saith
unto
him
See
thou
tell
man
but
show
thyself
the
priest
and
offer
the
gift
that
Moses
commanded
for
testimony
unto
them
Matthew
And
when
was
entered
into
Capernaum
there
came
unto
him
centurion
beseeching
him
Matthew
and
saying
Lord
servant
lieth
the
house
sick
the
palsy
grievously
tormented
Matthew
And
saith
unto
him
will
come
and
heal
him
Matthew
And
the
centurion
answered
and
said
Lord
not
worthy
that
thou
shouldest
come
under
roof
but
only
say
the
word
and
servant
shall
healed
Matthew
For
also
man
under
authority
having
under
myself
soldiers
and
say
this
one
and
goeth
and
another
Come
and
cometh
and
servant
this
and
doeth
Matthew
And
when
Jesus
heard
marvelled
and
said
them
that
followed
Verily
say
unto
you
have
not
found
great
faith
not
Israel
Matthew
And
say
unto
you
that
many
shall
come
from
the
east
and
the
west
and
shall
sit
down
with
Abraham
and
Isaac
and
Jacob
the
kingdom
heaven
Matthew
but
the
sons
the
kingdom
shall
cast
forth
into
the
outer
darkness
there
shall
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
teeth
Matthew
And
Jesus
said
unto
the
centurion
thy
way
thou
hast
believed
done
unto
thee
And
the
servant
was
healed
that
hour
Matthew
And
when
Jesus
was
come
into
Peter
house
saw
his
wife
mother
lying
sick
fever
Matthew
And
touched
her
hand
and
the
fever
left
her
and
she
arose
and
ministered
unto
him
Matthew
And
when
even
was
come
they
brought
unto
him
many
possessed
with
demons
and
cast
out
the
spirits
with
word
and
healed
all
that
were
sick
Matthew
that
might
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
through
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying
Himself
took
our
infirmities
and
bare
our
diseases
Matthew
Now
when
Jesus
saw
great
multitudes
about
him
gave
commandment
depart
unto
the
other
side
Matthew
And
there
came
scribe
and
said
unto
him
Teacher
will
follow
thee
whithersoever
thou
goest
Matthew
And
Jesus
saith
unto
him
The
foxes
have
holes
and
the
birds
the
heaven
have
nests
but
the
Son
man
hath
not
where
lay
his
head
Matthew
And
another
the
disciples
said
unto
him
Lord
suffer
first
and
bury
father
Matthew
But
Jesus
saith
unto
him
Follow
and
leave
the
dead
bury
their
own
dead
Matthew
And
when
was
entered
into
boat
his
disciples
followed
him
Matthew
And
behold
there
arose
great
tempest
the
sea
insomuch
that
the
boat
was
covered
with
the
waves
but
was
asleep
Matthew
And
they
came
him
and
awoke
him
saying
Save
Lord
perish
Matthew
And
saith
unto
them
Why
are
fearful
little
faith
Then
arose
and
rebuked
the
winds
and
the
sea
and
there
was
great
calm
Matthew
And
the
men
marvelled
saying
What
manner
man
this
that
even
the
winds
and
the
sea
obey
him
Matthew
And
when
was
come
the
other
side
into
the
country
the
Gadarenes
there
met
him
two
possessed
with
demons
coming
forth
out
the
tombs
exceeding
fierce
that
man
could
pass
that
way
Matthew
And
behold
they
cried
out
saying
What
have
with
thee
thou
Son
God
art
thou
come
hither
torment
before
the
time
Matthew
Now
there
was
afar
off
from
them
herd
many
swine
feeding
Matthew
And
the
demons
besought
him
saying
thou
cast
out
send
away
into
the
herd
swine
Matthew
And
said
unto
them
And
they
came
out
and
went
into
the
swine
and
behold
the
whole
herd
rushed
down
the
steep
into
the
sea
and
perished
the
waters
Matthew
And
they
that
fed
them
fled
and
went
away
into
the
city
and
told
everything
and
what
was
befallen
them
that
were
possessed
with
demons
Matthew
And
behold
all
the
city
came
out
meet
Jesus
and
when
they
saw
him
they
besought
him
that
would
depart
from
their
borders
Matthew
And
entered
into
boat
and
crossed
over
and
came
into
his
own
city
Matthew
And
behold
they
brought
him
man
sick
the
palsy
lying
bed
and
Jesus
seeing
their
faith
said
unto
the
sick
the
palsy
Son
good
cheer
thy
sins
are
forgiven
Matthew
And
behold
certain
the
scribes
said
within
themselves
This
man
blasphemeth
Matthew
And
Jesus
knowing
their
thoughts
said
Wherefore
think
evil
your
hearts
Matthew
For
which
easier
say
Thy
sins
are
forgiven
say
Arise
and
walk
Matthew
But
that
may
know
that
the
Son
man
hath
authority
earth
forgive
sins
then
saith
the
sick
the
palsy
Arise
and
take
thy
bed
and
unto
thy
house
Matthew
And
arose
and
departed
his
house
Matthew
But
when
the
multitudes
saw
they
were
afraid
and
glorified
God
who
had
given
such
authority
unto
men
Matthew
And
Jesus
passed
from
thence
saw
man
called
Matthew
sitting
the
place
toll
and
saith
unto
him
Follow
And
arose
and
followed
him
Matthew
And
came
pass
sat
meat
the
house
behold
many
publicans
and
sinners
came
and
sat
down
with
Jesus
and
his
disciples
Matthew
And
when
the
Pharisees
saw
they
said
unto
his
disciples
Why
eateth
your
Teacher
with
the
publicans
and
sinners
Matthew
But
when
heard
said
They
that
are
whole
have
need
physician
but
they
that
are
sick
Matthew
But
and
learn
what
this
meaneth
desire
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
for
came
not
call
the
righteous
but
sinners
Matthew
Then
come
him
the
disciples
John
saying
Why
and
the
Pharisees
fast
oft
but
thy
disciples
fast
not
Matthew
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
Can
the
sons
the
bridechamber
mourn
long
the
bridegroom
with
them
but
the
days
will
come
when
the
bridegroom
shall
taken
away
from
them
and
then
will
they
fast
Matthew
And
man
putteth
piece
undressed
cloth
upon
old
garment
for
that
which
should
fill
taketh
from
the
garment
and
worse
rent
made
Matthew
Neither
men
put
new
wine
into
old
wine
skins
else
the
skins
burst
and
the
wine
spilled
and
the
skins
perish
but
they
put
new
wine
into
fresh
wine
skins
and
both
are
preserved
Matthew
While
spake
these
things
unto
them
behold
there
came
ruler
and
worshipped
him
saying
daughter
even
now
dead
but
come
and
lay
thy
hand
upon
her
and
she
shall
live
Matthew
And
Jesus
arose
and
followed
him
and
did
his
disciples
Matthew
And
behold
woman
who
had
issue
blood
twelve
years
came
behind
him
and
touched
the
border
his
garment
Matthew
for
she
said
within
herself
but
touch
his
garment
shall
made
whole
Matthew
But
Jesus
turning
and
seeing
her
said
Daughter
good
cheer
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole
And
the
woman
was
made
whole
from
that
hour
Matthew
And
when
Jesus
came
into
the
ruler
house
and
saw
the
flute
players
and
the
crowd
making
tumult
Matthew
said
Give
place
for
the
damsel
not
dead
but
sleepeth
And
they
laughed
him
scorn
Matthew
But
when
the
crowd
was
put
forth
entered
and
took
her
the
hand
and
the
damsel
arose
Matthew
And
the
fame
hereof
went
forth
into
all
that
land
Matthew
And
Jesus
passed
from
thence
two
blind
men
followed
him
crying
out
and
saying
Have
mercy
thou
son
David
Matthew
And
when
was
come
into
the
house
the
blind
men
came
him
and
Jesus
saith
unto
them
Believe
that
able
this
They
say
unto
him
Yea
Lord
Matthew
Then
touched
their
eyes
saying
According
your
faith
done
unto
you
Matthew
And
their
eyes
were
opened
And
Jesus
strictly
charged
them
saying
See
that
man
know
Matthew
But
they
went
forth
and
spread
abroad
his
fame
all
that
land
Matthew
And
they
went
forth
behold
there
was
brought
him
dumb
man
possessed
with
demon
Matthew
And
when
the
demon
was
cast
out
the
dumb
man
spake
and
the
multitudes
marvelled
saying
was
never
seen
Israel
Matthew
But
the
Pharisees
said
the
prince
the
demons
casteth
out
demons
Matthew
And
Jesus
went
about
all
the
cities
and
the
villages
teaching
their
synagogues
and
preaching
the
gospel
the
kingdom
and
healing
all
manner
disease
and
all
manner
sickness
Matthew
But
when
saw
the
multitudes
was
moved
with
compassion
for
them
because
they
were
distressed
and
scattered
sheep
not
having
shepherd
Matthew
Then
saith
unto
his
disciples
The
harvest
indeed
plenteous
but
the
laborers
are
few
Matthew
Pray
therefore
the
Lord
the
harvest
that
send
forth
laborers
into
his
harvest
Matthew
And
called
unto
him
his
twelve
disciples
and
gave
them
authority
over
unclean
spirits
cast
them
out
and
heal
all
manner
disease
and
all
manner
sickness
Matthew
Now

and
charged
them

into
any

not
into

shall
speak
for
shall
given
you
that
hour
what
shall
speak
Matthew
For
not
that
speak
but
the
Spirit
your
Father
that
speaketh
you
Matthew
And
brother
shall
deliver
brother
death
and
the
father
his
child
and
children
shall
rise
against
parents
and
cause
them
put
death
Matthew
And
shall
hated
all
men
for
name
sake
but
that
endureth
the
end
the
same
shall
saved
Matthew
But
when
they
persecute
you
this
city
flee
into
the
next
for
verily
say
unto
you
shall
not
have
gone
through
the
cities
Israel
till
the
Son
man
come
Matthew
disciple
not
above
his
teacher
nor
servant
above
his
lord
Matthew
enough
for
the
disciple
that
his
teacher
and
the
servant
his
lord
they
have
called
the
master
the
house
Beelzebub
how
much
more
them
his
household
Matthew
Fear
them
not
therefore
for
there
nothing
covered
that
shall
not
revealed
and
hid
that
shall
not
known
Matthew
What
tell
you
the
darkness
speak
the
light
and
what
hear
the
ear
proclaim
upon
the
house
tops
Matthew
And
not
afraid
them
that
kill
the
body
but
are
not
able
kill
the
soul
but
rather
fear
him
who
able
destroy
both
soul
and
body
hell
Matthew
Are
not
two
sparrows
sold
for
penny
and
not
one
them
shall
fall
the
ground
without
your
Father
Matthew
but
the
very
hairs
your
head
are
all
numbered
Matthew
Fear
not
therefore
are
more
value
than
many
sparrows
Matthew
Every
one
therefore
who
shall
confess
before
men
him
will
also
confess
before
Father
who
heaven
Matthew
But
whosoever
shall
deny
before
men
him
will
also
deny
before
Father
who
heaven
Matthew
Think
not
that
came
send
peace
the
earth
came
not
send
peace
but
sword
Matthew
For
came
set
man
variance
against
his
father
and
the
daughter
against
her
mother
and
the
daughter
law
against
her
mother
law
Matthew
and
man
foes
shall
they
his
own
household
Matthew
that
loveth
father
mother
more
than
not
worthy
and
that
loveth
son
daughter
more
than
not
worthy
Matthew
And
that
doth
not
take
his
cross
and
follow
after
not
worthy
Matthew
that
findeth
his
life
shall
lose
and
that
loseth
his
life
for

Matthew
that

and
that

that

that

and
that

the

Matthew
And
whosoever

these

verily
say
unto
you
shall

Matthew
And
came
pass
when
Jesus
had
finished
commanding
his
twelve
disciples
departed
thence
teach
and
preach
their
cities
Matthew
Now
when
John
heard
the
prison
the
works
the
Christ
sent
his
disciples
Matthew
and
said
unto
him
Art
thou
that
cometh
look
for
another
Matthew
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
and
tell
John
the
things
which
hear
and
see
Matthew
the
blind
receive
their
sight
and
the
lame
walk
the
lepers
are
cleansed
and
the
deaf
hear
and
the
dead
are
raised
and
the
poor
have
good
tidings
preached
them
Matthew
And
blessed
whosoever
shall
find
occasion
stumbling
Matthew
And
these
went
their
way
Jesus
began
say
unto
the
multitudes
concerning
John
What
went
out
into
the
wilderness
behold
reed
shaken
with
the
wind
Matthew
But
what
went
out
see
man
clothed
soft
raiment
Behold
they
that
wear
soft
raiment
are
kings
houses
Matthew
But
wherefore
went
out
see
prophet
Yea
say
unto
you
and
much
more
than
prophet
Matthew
This
whom
written
Behold
send
messenger
before
thy
face
Who
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
thee
Matthew
Verily
say
unto
you
Among
them
that
are
born
women
there
hath
not
arisen
greater
than
John
the
Baptist
yet
that
but
little
the
kingdom
heaven
greater
than
Matthew
And
from
the
days
John
the
Baptist
until
now
the
kingdom
heaven
suffereth
violence
and
men
violence
take
force
Matthew
For
all
the
prophets
and
the
law
prophesied
until
John
Matthew
And
are
willing
receive
this
Elijah
that
come
Matthew
that
hath
ears
hear
let
him
hear
Matthew
But
whereunto
shall
liken
this
generation
like
unto
children
sitting
the
marketplaces
who
call
unto
their
fellows
Matthew
and
say
piped
unto
you
and
did
not
dance
wailed
and
did
not
mourn
Matthew
For
John
came
neither
eating
nor
drinking
and
they
say
hath
demon
Matthew
The
Son
man
came
eating
and
drinking
and
they
say
Behold
gluttonous
man
and
winebibber
friend
publicans
and
sinners
And
wisdom
justified
her
works
Matthew
Then
began
upbraid
the
cities
wherein
most
his
mighty
works
were
done
because
they
repented
not
Matthew
Woe
unto
thee
Chorazin
woe
unto
thee
Bethsaida
for
the
mighty
works
had
been
done
Tyre
and
Sidon
which
were
done
you
they
would
have
repented
long
ago
sackcloth
and
ashes
Matthew
But
say
unto
you
shall
more
tolerable
for
Tyre
and
Sidon
the
day
judgment
than
for
you
Matthew
And
thou
Capernaum
shalt
thou
exalted
unto
heaven
thou
shalt
down
unto
Hades
for
the
mighty
works
had
been
done
Sodom
which
were
done
thee
would
have
remained
until
this
day
Matthew
But
say
unto
you
that
shall
more
tolerable
for
the
land
Sodom
the
day
judgment
than
for
thee
Matthew
that
season
Jesus
answered
and
said
thank
thee
Father
Lord
heaven
and
earth
that
thou
didst
hide
these
things
from
the
wise
and
understanding
and
didst
reveal
them
unto
babes
Matthew
yea
Father
for
was
well
pleasing
thy
sight
Matthew
All
things
have
been
delivered
unto
Father
and
one
knoweth
the
Son
save
the
Father
neither
doth
any
know
the
Father
save
the
Son
and
whomsoever
the
Son
willeth
reveal
him
Matthew
Come
unto
all
that
labor
and
are
heavy
laden
and
will
give
you
rest
Matthew
Take
yoke
upon
you
and
learn
for
meek
and
lowly
heart
and
shall
find
rest
unto
your
souls
Matthew
For
yoke
easy
and
burden
light
Matthew
that
season
Jesus
went
the
sabbath
day
through
the
grainfields
and
his
disciples
were
hungry
and
began
pluck
ears
and
eat
Matthew
But
the
Pharisees
when
they
saw
said
unto
him
Behold
thy
disciples
that
which
not
lawful
upon
the
sabbath
Matthew
But
said
unto
them
Have
not
read
what
David
did
when
was
hungry
and
they
that
were
with
him
Matthew
how
entered
into
the
house
God
and
ate
the
showbread
which
was
not
lawful
for
him
eat
neither
for
them
that
were
with
him
but
only
for
the
priests
Matthew
have
not
read
the
law
that
the
sabbath
day
the
priests
the
temple
profane
the
sabbath
and
are
guiltless
Matthew
But
say
unto
you
that
one
greater
than
the
temple
here
Matthew
But
had
known
what
this
meaneth
desire
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
would
not
have
condemned
the
guiltless
Matthew
For
the
Son
man
lord
the
sabbath
Matthew
And
departed
thence
and
went
into
their
synagogue
Matthew
and
behold
man
having
withered
hand
And
they
asked
him
saying
lawful
heal
the
sabbath
day
that
they
might
accuse
him
Matthew
And
said
unto
them
What
man
shall
there
you
that
shall
have
one
sheep
and
this
fall
into
pit
the
sabbath
day
will
not
lay
hold
and
lift
out
Matthew
How
much
then
man
more
value
than
sheep
Wherefore
lawful
good
the
sabbath
day
Matthew
Then
saith
the
man
Stretch
forth
thy
hand
And
stretched
forth
and
was
restored
whole
the
other
Matthew
But
the
Pharisees
went
out
and
took
counsel
against
him
how
they
might
destroy
him
Matthew
And
Jesus
perceiving
withdrew
from
thence
and
many
followed
him
and
healed
them
all
Matthew
and
charged
them
that
they
should
not
make
him
known
Matthew
that
might
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
through
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying
Matthew
Behold
servant
whom
have
chosen
beloved
whom
soul
well
pleased
will
put
Spirit
upon
him
And
shall
declare
judgment
the
Gentiles
Matthew
shall
not
strive
nor
cry
aloud
Neither
shall
any
one
hear
his
voice
the
streets
Matthew
bruised
reed
shall
not
break
And
smoking
flax
shall
not
quench
Till
send
forth
judgment
unto
victory
Matthew
And
his
name
shall
the
Gentiles
hope
Matthew
Then
was
brought
unto
him
one
possessed
with
demon
blind
and
dumb
and
healed
him
insomuch
that
the
dumb
man
spake
and
saw
Matthew
And
all
the
multitudes
were
amazed
and
said
Can
this
the
son
David
Matthew
But
when
the
Pharisees
heard
they
said
This
man
doth
not
cast
out
demons
but
Beelzebub
the
prince
the
demons
Matthew
And
knowing
their
thoughts
said
unto
them
Every
kingdom
divided
against
itself
brought
desolation
and
every
city
house
divided
against
itself
shall
not
stand
Matthew
and
Satan
casteth
out
Satan
divided
against
himself
how
then
shall
his
kingdom
stand
Matthew
And
Beelzebub
cast
out
demons
whom
your
sons
cast
them
out
therefore
shall
they
your
judges
Matthew
But
the
Spirit
God
cast
out
demons
then
the
kingdom
God
come
upon
you
Matthew
how
can
one
enter
into
the
house
the
strong
man
and
spoil
his
goods
except
first
bind
the
strong
man
and
then
will
spoil
his
house
Matthew
that
not
with
against
and
that
gathereth
not
with
scattereth
Matthew
Therefore
say
unto
you
Every
sin
and
blasphemy
shall
forgiven
unto
men
but
the
blasphemy
against
the
Spirit
shall
not
forgiven
Matthew
And
whosoever
shall
speak
word
against
the
Son
man
shall
forgiven
him
but
whosoever
shall
speak
against
the
Holy
Spirit
shall
not
forgiven
him
neither
this
world
nor
that
which
come
Matthew
Either
make
the
tree
good
and
its
fruit
good
make
the
tree
corrupt
and
its
fruit
corrupt
for
the
tree
known
its
fruit
Matthew
offspring
vipers
how
can
being
evil
speak
good
things
for
out
the
abundance
the
heart
the
mouth
speaketh
Matthew
The
good
man
out
his
good
treasure
bringeth
forth
good
things
and
the
evil
man
out
his
evil
treasure
bringeth
forth
evil
things
Matthew
And
say
unto
you
that
every
idle
word
that
men
shall
speak
they
shall
give
account
thereof
the
day
judgment
Matthew
For
thy
words
thou
shalt
justified
and
thy
words
thou
shalt
condemned
Matthew
Then
certain
the
scribes
and
Pharisees
answered
him
saying
Teacher
would
see
sign
from
thee
Matthew
But
answered
and
said
unto
them
evil
and
adulterous
generation
seeketh
after
sign
and
there
shall
sign
given
but
the
sign
Jonah
the
prophet
Matthew
for
Jonah
was
three
days
and
three
nights
the
belly
the
whale
shall
the
Son
man
three
days
and
three
nights
the
heart
the
earth
Matthew
The
men
Nineveh
shall
stand
the
judgment
with
this
generation
and
shall
condemn
for
they
repented
the
preaching
Jonah
and
behold
greater
than
Jonah
here
Matthew
The
queen
the
south
shall
rise
the
judgment
with
this
generation
and
shall
condemn
for
she
came
from
the
ends
the
earth
hear
the
wisdom
Solomon
and
behold
greater
than
Solomon
here
Matthew
But
the
unclean
spirit
when
gone
out
the
man
passeth
through
waterless
places
seeking
rest
and
findeth
not
Matthew
Then
saith
will
return
into
house
whence
came
out
and
when
come
findeth
empty
swept
and
garnished
Matthew
Then
goeth
and
taketh
with
himself
seven
other
spirits
more
evil
than
himself
and
they
enter
and
dwell
there
and
the
last
state
that
man
becometh
worse
than
the
first
Even
shall
also
unto
this
evil
generation
Matthew
While
was
yet
speaking
the
multitudes
behold
his
mother
and
his
brethren
stood
without
seeking
speak
him
Matthew
And
one
said
unto
him
Behold
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
stand
without
seeking
speak
thee
Matthew
But
answered
and
said
unto
him
that
told
him
Who
mother
and
who
are
brethren
Matthew
And
stretched
forth
his
hand
towards
his
disciples
and
said
Behold
mother
and
brethren
Matthew
For
whosoever
shall
the
will
Father
who
heaven
brother
and
sister
and
mother
Matthew
that
day
went
Jesus
out
the
house
and
sat
the
sea
side
Matthew
And
there
were
gathered
unto
him
great
multitudes
that
entered
into
boat
and
sat
and
all
the
multitude
stood
the
beach
Matthew
And
spake
them
many
things
parables
saying
Behold
the
sower
went
forth
sow
Matthew
and
sowed
some
seeds
fell
the
way
side
and
the
birds
came
and
devoured
them
Matthew
and
others
fell
upon
the
rocky
places
where
they
had
not
much
earth
and
straightway
they
sprang
because
they
had
deepness
earth
Matthew
and
when
the
sun
was
risen
they
were
scorched
and
because
they
had
root
they
withered
away
Matthew
And
others
fell
upon
the
thorns
and
the
thorns
grew
and
choked
them
Matthew
and
others
fell
upon
the
good
ground
and
yielded
fruit
some
hundredfold
some
sixty
some
thirty
Matthew
that
hath
ears
let
him
hear
Matthew
And
the
disciples
came
and
said
unto
him
Why
speakest
thou
unto
them
parables
Matthew
And
answered
and
said
unto
them
Unto
you
given
know
the
mysteries
the
kingdom
heaven
but
them
not
given
Matthew
For
whosoever
hath
him
shall
given
and
shall
have
abundance
but
whosoever
hath
not
from
him
shall
taken
away
even
that
which
hath
Matthew
Therefore
speak
them
parables
because
seeing
they
see
not
and
hearing
they
hear
not
neither
they
understand
Matthew
And
unto
them
fulfilled
the
prophecy
Isaiah
which
saith
hearing
shall
hear
and
shall
wise
understand
And
seeing
shall
see
and
shall
wise
perceive
Matthew
For
this
people
heart
waxed
gross
And
their
ears
are
dull
hearing
And
their
eyes
they
have
closed
Lest
haply
they
should
perceive
with
their
eyes
And
hear
with
their
ears
And
understand
with
their
heart
And
should
turn
again
And
should
heal
them
Matthew
But
blessed
are
your
eyes
for
they
see
and
your
ears
for
they
hear
Matthew
For
verily
say
unto
you
that
many
prophets
and
righteous
men
desired
see
the
things
which
see
and
saw
them
not
and
hear
the
things
which
hear
and
heard
them
not
Matthew
Hear
then
the
parable
the
sower
Matthew
When
any
one
heareth
the
word
the
kingdom
and
understandeth
not
then
cometh
the
evil
one
and
snatcheth
away
that
which
hath
been
sown
his
heart
This
that
was
sown
the
way
side
Matthew
And
that
was
sown
upon
the
rocky
places
this
that
heareth
the
word
and
straightway
with
joy
receiveth
Matthew
yet
hath
not
root
himself
but
endureth
for
while
and
when
tribulation
persecution
ariseth
because
the
word
straightway
stumbleth
Matthew
And
that
was
sown
among
the
thorns
this
that
heareth
the
word
and
the
care
the
world
and
the
deceitfulness
riches
choke
the
word
and
becometh
unfruitful
Matthew
And
that
was
sown
upon
the
good
ground
this
that
heareth
the
word
and
understandeth
who
verily
beareth
fruit
and
bringeth
forth
some
hundredfold
some
sixty
some
thirty
Matthew
Another
parable
set
before
them
saying
The
kingdom
heaven
likened
unto
man
that
sowed
good
seed
his
field
Matthew
but
while
men
slept
his
enemy
came
and
sowed
tares
also
among
the
wheat
and
went
away
Matthew
But
when
the
blade
sprang
and
brought
forth
fruit
then
appeared
the
tares
also
Matthew
And
the
servants
the
householder
came
and
said
unto
him
Sir
didst
thou
not
sow
good
seed
thy
field
whence
then
hath
tares
Matthew
And
said
unto
them
enemy
hath
done
this
And
the
servants
say
unto
him
Wilt
thou
then
that
and
gather
them
Matthew
But
saith
Nay
lest
haply
while
gather
the
tares
root
the
wheat
with
them
Matthew
Let
both
grow
together
until
the
harvest
and
the
time
the
harvest
will
say
the
reapers
Gather
first
the
tares
and
bind
them
bundles
burn
them
but
gather
the
wheat
into
barn
Matthew
Another
parable
set
before
them
saying
The
kingdom
heaven
like
unto
grain
mustard
seed
which
man
took
and
sowed
his
field
Matthew
which
indeed
less
than
all
seeds
but
when
grown
greater
than
the
herbs
and
becometh
tree
that
the
birds
the
heaven
come
and
lodge
the
branches
thereof
Matthew
Another
parable
spake
unto
them
The
kingdom
heaven
like
unto
leaven
which
woman
took
and
hid
three
measures
meal
till
was
all
leavened
Matthew
All
these
things
spake
Jesus
parables
unto
the
multitudes
and
without
parable
spake
nothing
unto
them
Matthew
that
might
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
through
the
prophet
saying
will
open
mouth
parables
will
utter
things
hidden
from
the
foundation
the
world
Matthew
Then
left
the
multitudes
and
went
into
the
house
and
his
disciples
came
unto
him
saying
Explain
unto
the
parable
the
tares
the
field
Matthew
And
answered
and
said
that
soweth
the
good
seed
the
Son
man
Matthew
and
the
field
the
world
and
the
good
seed
these
are
the
sons
the
kingdom
and
the
tares
are
the
sons
the
evil
one
Matthew
and
the
enemy
that
sowed
them
the
devil
and
the
harvest
the
end
the
world
and
the
reapers
are
angels
Matthew
therefore
the
tares
are
gathered
and
burned
with
fire
shall
the
end
the
world
Matthew
The
Son
man
shall
send
forth
his
angels
and
they
shall
gather
out
his
kingdom
all
things
that
cause
stumbling
and
them
that
iniquity
Matthew
and
shall
cast
them
into
the
furnace
fire
there
shall
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
teeth
Matthew
Then
shall
the
righteous
shine
forth
the
sun
the
kingdom
their
Father
that
hath
ears
let
him
hear
Matthew
The
kingdom
heaven
like
unto
treasure
hidden
the
field
which
man
found
and
hid
and
his
joy
goeth
and
selleth
all
that
hath
and
buyeth
that
field
Matthew
Again
the
kingdom
heaven
like
unto
man
that
merchant
seeking
goodly
pearls
Matthew
and
having
found
one
pearl
great
price
went
and
sold
all
that
had
and
bought
Matthew
Again
the
kingdom
heaven
like
unto
net
that
was
cast
into
the
sea
and
gathered
every
kind
Matthew
which
when
was
filled
they
drew
the
beach
and
they
sat
down
and
gathered
the
good
into
vessels
but
the
bad
they
cast
away
Matthew
shall
the
end
the
world
the
angels
shall
come
forth
and
sever
the
wicked
from
among
the
righteous
Matthew
and
shall
cast
them
into
the
furnace
fire
there
shall
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
teeth
Matthew
Have
understood
all
these
things
They
say
unto
him
Yea
Matthew
And
said
unto
them
Therefore
every
scribe
who
hath
been
made
disciple
the
kingdom
heaven
like
unto
man
that
householder
who
bringeth
forth
out
his
treasure
things
new
and
old
Matthew
And
came
pass
when
Jesus
had
finished
these
parables
departed
thence
Matthew
And
coming
into
his
own
country
taught
them
their
synagogue
insomuch
that
they
were
astonished
and
said
Whence
hath
this
man
this
wisdom
and
these
mighty
works
Matthew
not
this
the
carpenter
son
not
his
mother
called
Mary
and
his
brethren
James
and
Joseph
and
Simon
and
Judas
Matthew
And
his
sisters
are
they
not
all
with
Whence
then
hath
this
man
all
these
things
Matthew
And
they
were
offended
him
But
Jesus
said
unto
them
prophet
not
without
honor
save
his
own
country
and
his
own
house
Matthew
And
did
not
many
mighty
works
there
because
their
unbelief
Matthew
that
season
Herod
the
tetrarch
heard
the
report
concerning
Jesus
Matthew
and
said
unto
his
servants
This
John
the
Baptist
risen
from
the
dead
and
therefore
these
powers
work
him
Matthew
For
Herod
had
laid
hold
John
and
bound
him
and
put
him
prison
for
the
sake
Herodias
his
brother
Philip
wife
Matthew
For
John
said
unto
him
not
lawful
for
thee
have
her
Matthew
And
when
would
have
put
him
death
feared
the
multitude
because
they
counted
him
prophet
Matthew
But
when
Herod
birthday
came
the
daughter
Herodias
danced
the
midst
and
pleased
Herod
Matthew
Whereupon
promised
with
oath
give
her
whatsoever
she
should
ask
Matthew
And
she
being
put
forward
her
mother
saith
Give
here
platter
the
head
John
the
Baptist
Matthew
And
the
king
was
grieved
but
for
the
sake
his
oaths
and
them
that
sat
meat
with
him
commanded
given
Matthew
and
sent
and
beheaded
John
the
prison
Matthew
And
his
head
was
brought
platter
and
given
the
damsel
and
she
brought
her
mother
Matthew
And
his
disciples
came
and
took
the
corpse
and
buried
him
and
they
went
and
told
Jesus
Matthew
Now
when
Jesus
heard
withdrew
from
thence
boat
desert
place
apart
and
when
the
multitudes
heard
thereof
they
followed
him
foot
from
the
cities
Matthew
And
came
forth
and
saw
great
multitude
and
had
compassion
them
and
healed
their
sick
Matthew
And
when
even
was
come
the
disciples
came
him
saying
The
place
desert
and
the
time
already
past
send
the
multitudes
away
that
they
may
into
the
villages
and
buy
themselves
food
Matthew
But
Jesus
said
unto
them
They
have
need
away
give
them
eat
Matthew
And
they
say
unto
him
have
here
but
five
loaves
and
two
fishes
Matthew
And
said
Bring
them
hither
Matthew
And
commanded
the
multitudes
sit
down
the
grass
and
took
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fishes
and
looking
heaven
blessed
and
brake
and
gave
the
loaves
the
disciples
and
the
disciples
the
multitudes
Matthew
And
they
all
ate
and
were
filled
and
they
took
that
which
remained
over
the
broken
pieces
twelve
baskets
full
Matthew
And
they
that
did
eat
were
about
five
thousand
men
besides
women
and
children
Matthew
And
straightway
constrained
the
disciples
enter
into
the
boat
and
before
him
unto
the
other
side
till
should
send
the
multitudes
away
Matthew
And
after
had
sent
the
multitudes
away
went
into
the
mountain
apart
pray
and
when
even
was
come
was
there
alone
Matthew
But
the
boat
was
now
the
midst
the
sea
distressed
the
waves
for
the
wind
was
contrary
Matthew
And
the
fourth
watch
the
night
came
unto
them
walking
upon
the
sea
Matthew
And
when
the
disciples
saw
him
walking
the
sea
they
were
troubled
saying
ghost
and
they
cried
out
for
fear
Matthew
But
straightway
Jesus
spake
unto
them
saying
good
cheer
not
afraid
Matthew
And
Peter
answered
him
and
said
Lord
thou
bid
come
unto
thee
upon
the
waters
Matthew
And
said
Come
And
Peter
went
down
from
the
boat
and
walked
upon
the
waters
come
Jesus
Matthew
But
when
saw
the
wind
was
afraid
and
beginning
sink
cried
out
saying
Lord
save
Matthew
And
immediately
Jesus
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
took
hold
him
and
saith
unto
him
thou
little
faith
wherefore
didst
thou
doubt
Matthew
And
when
they
were
gone
into
the
boat
the
wind
ceased
Matthew
And
they
that
were
the
boat
worshipped
him
saying
truth
thou
art
the
Son
God
Matthew
And
when
they
had
crossed
over
they
came
the
land
unto
Gennesaret
Matthew
And
when
the
men
that
place
knew
him
they
sent
into
all
that
region
round
about
and
brought
unto
him
all
that
were
sick
Matthew
and
they
besought
him
that
they
might
only
touch
the
border
his
garment
and
many
touched
were
made
whole
Matthew
Then
there
come
Jesus
from
Jerusalem
Pharisees
and
scribes
saying
Matthew
Why
thy
disciples
transgress
the
tradition
the
elders
for
they
wash
not
their
hands
when
they
eat
bread
Matthew
And
answered
and
said
unto
them
Why
also
transgress
the
commandment
God
because
your
tradition
Matthew
For
God
said
Honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
that
speaketh
evil
father
mother
let
him
die
the
death
Matthew
But
say
Whosoever
shall
say
his
father
his
mother
That
wherewith
thou
mightest
have
been
profited
given
God
Matthew
shall
not
honor
his
father
And
have
made
void
the
word
God
because
your
tradition
Matthew
hypocrites
well
did
Isaiah
prophesy
you
saying
Matthew
This
people
honoreth
with
their
lips
But
their
heart
far
from
Matthew
But
vain
they
worship
Teaching
their
doctrines
the
precepts
men
Matthew
And
called
him
the
multitude
and
said
unto
them
Hear
and
understand
Matthew
Not
that
which
entereth
into
the
mouth
defileth
the
man
but
that
which
proceedeth
out
the
mouth
this
defileth
the
man
Matthew
Then
came
the
disciples
and
said
unto
him
Knowest
thou
that
the
Pharisees
were
offended
when
they
heard
this
saying
Matthew
But
answered
and
said
Every
plant
which
heavenly
Father
planted
not
shall
rooted
Matthew
Let
them
alone
they
are
blind
guides
And
the
blind
guide
the
blind
both
shall
fall
into
pit
Matthew
And
Peter
answered
and
said
unto
him
Declare
unto
the
parable
Matthew
And
said
Are
also
even
yet
without
understanding
Matthew
Perceive
not
that
whatsoever
goeth
into
the
mouth
passeth
into
the
belly
and
cast
out
into
the
draught
Matthew
But
the
things
which
proceed
out
the
mouth
come
forth
out
the
heart
and
they
defile
the
man
Matthew
For
out
the
heart
come
forth
evil
thoughts
murders
adulteries
fornications
thefts
false
witness
railings
Matthew
these
are
the
things
which
defile
the
man
but
eat
with
unwashen
hands
defileth
not
the
man
Matthew
And
Jesus
went
out
thence
and
withdrew
into
the
parts
Tyre
and
Sidon
Matthew
And
behold
Canaanitish
woman
came
out
from
those
borders
and
cried
saying
Have
mercy
Lord
thou
son
David
daughter
grievously
vexed
with
demon
Matthew
But
answered
her
not
word
And
his
disciples
came
and
besought
him
saying
Send
her
away
for
she
crieth
after
Matthew
But
answered
and
said
was
not
sent
but
unto
the
lost
sheep
the
house
Israel
Matthew
But
she
came
and
worshipped
him
saying
Lord
help
Matthew
And
answered
and
said
not
meet
take
the
children
bread
and
cast
the
dogs
Matthew
But
she
said
Yea
Lord
for
even
the
dogs
eat
the
crumbs
which
fall
from
their
masters
table
Matthew
Then
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
her
woman
great
thy
faith
done
unto
thee
even
thou
wilt
And
her
daughter
was
healed
from
that
hour
Matthew
And
Jesus
departed
thence
and
came
nigh
unto
the
sea
Galilee
and
went
into
the
mountain
and
sat
there
Matthew
And
there
came
unto
him
great
multitudes
having
with
them
the
lame
blind
dumb
maimed
and
many
others
and
they
cast
them
down
his
feet
and
healed
them
Matthew
insomuch
that
the
multitude
wondered
when
they
saw
the
dumb
speaking
the
maimed
whole
and
the
lame
walking
and
the
blind
seeing
and
they
glorified
the
God
Israel
Matthew
And
Jesus
called
unto
him
his
disciples
and
said
have
compassion
the
multitude
because
they
continue
with
now
three
days
and
have
nothing
eat
and
would
not
send
them
away
fasting
lest
haply
they
faint
the
way
Matthew
And
the
disciples
say
unto
him
Whence
should
have
many
loaves
desert
place
fill
great
multitude
Matthew
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
How
many
loaves
have
And
they
said
Seven
and
few
small
fishes
Matthew
And
commanded
the
multitude
sit
down
the
ground
Matthew
and
took
the
seven
loaves
and
the
fishes
and
gave
thanks
and
brake
and
gave
the
disciples
and
the
disciples
the
multitudes
Matthew
And
they
all
ate
and
were
filled
and
they
took
that
which
remained
over
the
broken
pieces
seven
baskets
full
Matthew
And
they
that
did
eat
were
four
thousand
men
besides
women
and
children
Matthew
And
sent
away
the
multitudes
and
entered
into
the
boat
and
came
into
the
borders
Magadan
Matthew
And
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
came
and
trying
him
asked
him
show
them
sign
from
heaven
Matthew
But
answered
and
said
unto
them
When
evening
say
will
fair
weather
for
the
heaven
red
Matthew
And
the
morning
will
foul
weather
day
for
the
heaven
red
and
lowering
know
how
discern
the
face
the
heaven
but
cannot
discern
the
signs
the
times
Matthew
evil
and
adulterous
generation
seeketh
after
sign
and
there
shall
sign
given
unto
but
the
sign
Jonah
And
left
them
and
departed
Matthew
And
the
disciples
came
the
other
side
and
forgot
take
bread
Matthew
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
Take
heed
and
beware
the
leaven
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
Matthew
And
they
reasoned
among
themselves
saying
took
bread
Matthew
And
Jesus
perceiving
said
little
faith
why
reason
among
yourselves
because
have
bread
Matthew
not
yet
perceive
neither
remember
the
five
loaves
the
five
thousand
and
how
many
baskets
took
Matthew
Neither
the
seven
loaves
the
four
thousand
and
how
many
baskets
took
Matthew
How
that
not
perceive
that
spake
not
you
concerning
bread
But
beware
the
leaven
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
Matthew
Then
understood
they
that
bade
them
not
beware
the
leaven
bread
but
the
teaching
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
Matthew
Now
when
Jesus
came
into
the
parts
Cæsarea
Philippi
asked
his
disciples
saying
Who
men
say
that
the
Son
man
Matthew
And
they
said
Some
say
John
the
Baptist
some
Elijah
and
others
Jeremiah
one
the
prophets
Matthew
saith
unto
them
But
who
say
that
Matthew
And
Simon
Peter
answered
and
said
Thou
art
the
Christ
the
Son
the
living
God
Matthew
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
Blessed
art
thou
Simon
Bar
Jonah
for
flesh
and
blood
hath
not
revealed
unto
thee
but
Father
who
heaven
Matthew
And
also
say
unto
thee
that
thou
art
Peter
and
upon
this
rock
will
build
church
and
the
gates
Hades
shall
not
prevail
against
Matthew
will
give
unto
thee
the
keys
the
kingdom
heaven
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bind
earth
shall
bound
heaven
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
loose
earth
shall
loosed
heaven
Matthew
Then
charged
the
disciples
that
they
should
tell
man
that
was
the
Christ
Matthew
From
that
time
began
Jesus
show
unto
his
disciples
that
must
unto
Jerusalem
and
suffer
many
things
the
elders
and
chief
priests
and
scribes
and
killed
and
the
third
day
raised
Matthew
And
Peter
took
him
and
began
rebuke
him
saying
far
from
thee
Lord
this
shall
never
unto
thee
Matthew
But
turned
and
said
unto
Peter
Get
thee
behind
Satan
thou
art
stumbling
block
unto
for
thou
mindest
not
the
things
God
but
the
things
men
Matthew
Then
said
Jesus
unto
his
disciples
any
man
would
come
after
let
him
deny
himself
and
take
his
cross
and
follow
Matthew
For
whosoever
would
save
his
life
shall
lose
and
whosoever
shall
lose
his
life
for
sake
shall
find
Matthew
For
what
shall
man
profited
shall
gain
the
whole
world
and
forfeit
his
life
what
shall
man
give
exchange
for
his
life
Matthew
For
the
Son
man
shall
come
the
glory
his
Father
with
his
angels
and
then
shall
render
unto
every
man
according
his
deeds
Matthew
Verily
say
unto
you
There
are
some
them
that
stand
here
who
shall
wise
taste
death
till
they
see
the
Son
man
coming
his
kingdom
Matthew
And
after
six
days
Jesus
taketh
with
him
Peter
and
James
and
John
his
brother
and
bringeth
them
into
high
mountain
apart
Matthew
and
was
transfigured
before
them
and
his
face
did
shine
the
sun
and
his
garments
became
white
the
light
Matthew
And
behold
there
appeared
unto
them
Moses
and
Elijah
talking
with
him
Matthew
And
Peter
answered
and
said
unto
Jesus
Lord
good
for
here
thou
wilt
will
make
here
three
tabernacles
one
for
thee
and
one
for
Moses
and
one
for
Elijah
Matthew
While
was
yet
speaking
behold
bright
cloud
overshadowed
them
and
behold
voice
out
the
cloud
saying
This
beloved
Son
whom
well
pleased
hear
him
Matthew
And
when
the
disciples
heard
they
fell
their
face
and
were
sore
afraid
Matthew
And
Jesus
came
and
touched
them
and
said
Arise
and
not
afraid
Matthew
And
lifting
their
eyes
they
saw
one
save
Jesus
only
Matthew
And
they
were
coming
down
from
the
mountain
Jesus
commanded
them
saying
Tell
the
vision
man
until
the
Son
man
risen
from
the
dead
Matthew
And
his
disciples
asked
him
saying
Why
then
say
the
scribes
that
Elijah
must
first
come
Matthew
And
answered
and
said
Elijah
indeed
cometh
and
shall
restore
all
things
Matthew
but
say
unto
you
that
Elijah
come
already
and
they
knew
him
not
but
did
unto
him
whatsoever
they
would
Even
shall
the
Son
man
also
suffer
them
Matthew
Then
understood
the
disciples
that
spake
unto
them
John
the
Baptist
Matthew
And
when
they
were
come
the
multitude
there
came
him
man
kneeling
him
and
saying
Matthew
Lord
have
mercy
son
for
epileptic
and
suffereth
grievously
for
oft
times
falleth
into
the
fire
and
oft
times
into
the
water
Matthew
And
brought
him
thy
disciples
and
they
could
not
cure
him
Matthew
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
faithless
and
perverse
generation
how
long
shall
with
you
how
long
shall
bear
with
you
bring
him
hither
Matthew
And
Jesus
rebuked
him
and
the
demon
went
out
him
and
the
boy
was
cured
from
that
hour
Matthew
Then
came
the
disciples
Jesus
apart
and
said
Why
could
not
cast
out
Matthew
And
saith

Matthew
And
while
they
abode
Galilee
Jesus
said
unto
them
The
Son
man
shall
delivered
into
the
hands
men
Matthew
and
they
shall
kill
him
and
the
third
day

And
they
were
exceeding
sorry
Matthew
And
when
they
were
come
Capernaum
they
that
received
the
half
shekel
came
Peter
and
said
Doth
not
your
teacher
pay
the
half
shekel
Matthew
saith
Yea
And
when
came
into
the
house
Jesus
spake
first
him
saying
What
thinkest
thou
Simon
the
kings
the
earth
from
whom
they
receive
toll
tribute
from
their
sons
from
strangers
Matthew
And
when
said
From
strangers
Jesus
said
unto
him
Therefore
the
sons
are
free
Matthew
But
lest
cause
them
stumble

and
when
thou
hast
opened
his
mouth
thou
shalt
find
shekel
that

give
unto
them
for

thee
Matthew
that
hour
came
the
disciples
unto
Jesus
saying
Who
then
greatest
the
kingdom
heaven
Matthew
And
called
him
little
child
and
set
him
the
midst
them
Matthew
and
said
Verily
say
unto
you
Except

and
become
little
children

Matthew
Whosoever
therefore
shall

Matthew
And
whoso

but
whoso

profitable
for
him
that

Matthew
Woe

the
world
because

the
occasions
come
but
woe
that
man
through
whom
the

And

And

See

unto
you
that

Matthew
How
think
any
man
have
hundred
sheep
and
one
them
gone
astray
doth
not
leave
the
ninety
and
nine
and
unto
the
mountains
and
seek
that
which
goeth
astray
Matthew
And
that
find
verily
say
unto
you
rejoiceth
over
more
than
over
the
ninety
and
nine
which
have
not
gone
astray
Matthew
Even
not

will
your
Father
who

that

And

thou

Matthew
But
hear

one
two
more
that

And
refuse

the
church
and
refuse

the
church
also
let
him
unto
thee
the
Gentile
and
the
publican
Matthew
Verily
say
unto
you
What
things
soever

bind
earth
shall
bound
heaven
and
what
things
soever
shall
loose
earth

Matthew
Again
say
unto
you
that
two
you
shall
agree
earth
touching
anything
that
they
shall
ask
shall
done
for
them
Father
who
heaven
Matthew
For
where
two
three
are
gathered
together
name
there
the
midst
them
Matthew
Then
came
Peter
and
said
him
Lord
how
oft
shall
brother
sin
against
and
forgive
him
until
seven
times
Matthew
Jesus
saith
unto
him
say
not
unto
thee
Until
seven
times
but
Until
seventy
times
seven
Matthew
Therefore
the
kingdom
heaven
likened
unto
certain
king
who
would
make
reckoning
with
his
servants
Matthew
And
when
had
begun
reckon
one
was
brought
unto
him
that
owed
him
ten
thousand
talents
Matthew
But
forasmuch
had
not
wherewith
pay
his
lord
commanded
him
sold
and
his
wife
and
children
and
all
that
had
and
payment
made
Matthew
The
servant
therefore
fell
down
and
worshipped
him
saying
Lord
have
patience
with
and
will
pay
thee
all
Matthew
And
the
lord
that
servant
being
moved
with
compassion
released
him
and
forgave
him
the
debt
Matthew
But
that
servant
went
out
and
found
one
his
fellow
servants
who
owed
him
hundred
shillings
and
laid
hold
him
and
took
him
the
throat
saying
Pay
what
thou
owest
Matthew
his
fellow
servant
fell
down
and
besought
him
saying
Have
patience
with
and
will
pay
thee
Matthew
And
would
not
but
went
and
cast
him
into
prison
till
should
pay
that
which
was
due
Matthew
when
his
fellow
servants
saw
what
was
done
they
were
exceeding
sorry
and
came
and
told
unto
their
lord
all
that
was
done
Matthew
Then
his
lord
called
him
unto
him
and
saith
him
Thou
wicked
servant
forgave
thee
all
that
debt
because
thou
besoughtest
Matthew
shouldest
not
thou
also
have
had
mercy
thy
fellow
servant
even
had
mercy
thee
Matthew
And
his
lord
was
wroth
and
delivered
him
the
tormentors
till
should
pay
all
that
was
due
Matthew
shall
also
heavenly
Father
unto
you
forgive
not
every
one
his
brother
from
your
hearts
Matthew
And
came
pass
when
Jesus
had
finished
these
words
departed
from
Galilee
and
came
into
the
borders
Judæa
beyond
the
Jordan
Matthew
and
great
multitudes
followed
him
and
healed
them
there
Matthew
And
there
came
unto
him
Pharisees
trying
him
and
saying
lawful
for
man
put
away
his
wife
for
every
cause
Matthew
And
answered
and
said
Have
not
read
that
who
made
them
from
the
beginning
made
them
male
and
female
Matthew
and
said
For
this
cause
shall
man
leave
his
father
and
mother
and
shall
cleave
his
wife
and
the
two
shall
become
one
flesh
Matthew
that
they
are
more
two
but
one
flesh
What
therefore
God
hath
joined
together
let
not
man
put
asunder
Matthew
They
say
unto
him
Why
then
did
Moses
command
give
bill
divorcement
and
put
her
away
Matthew
saith
unto
them
Moses
for
your
hardness
heart
suffered
you
put
away
your
wives
but
from
the
beginning
hath
not
been
Matthew
And
say
unto
you
Whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
except
for
fornication
and
shall
marry
another
committeth
adultery
and
that
marrieth
her
when
she
put
away
committeth
adultery
Matthew
The
disciples
say
unto
him
the
case
the
man
with
his
wife
not
expedient
marry
Matthew
But
said
unto
them
Not
all
men
can
receive
this
saying
but
they
whom
given
Matthew
For
there
are
eunuchs
that
were
born
from
their
mother
womb
and
there
are
eunuchs
that
were
made
eunuchs
men
and
there
are
eunuchs
that
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
kingdom
heaven
sake
that
able
receive
let
him
receive
Matthew
Then
were
there
brought
unto
him
little
children
that
should
lay
his
hands
them
and
pray
and
the
disciples
rebuked
them
Matthew
But
Jesus
said
Suffer
the
little
children
and
forbid
them
not
come
unto
for
such
belongeth
the
kingdom
heaven
Matthew
And
laid
his
hands
them
and
departed
thence
Matthew
And
behold
one
came
him
and
said
Teacher
what
good
thing
shall
that
may
have
eternal
life
Matthew
And
said
unto
him
Why
askest
thou
concerning
that
which
good
One
there
who
good
but
thou
wouldest
enter
into
life
keep
the
commandments
Matthew
saith
unto
him
Which
And
Jesus
said
Thou
shalt
not
kill
Thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
Thou
shalt
not
steal
Thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
Matthew
Honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
thyself
Matthew
The
young
man
saith
unto
him
All
these
things
have
observed
what
lack
yet
Matthew
Jesus
said
unto
him
thou
wouldest
perfect
sell
that
which
thou
hast
and
give
the
poor
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
heaven
and
come
follow
Matthew
But
when
the
young
man
heard
the
saying
went
away
sorrowful
for
was
one
that
had
great
possessions
Matthew
And
Jesus
said
unto
his
disciples
Verily
say
unto
you
hard
for
rich
man
enter
into
the
kingdom
heaven
Matthew
And
again
say
unto
you
easier
for
camel
through
needle
eye
than
for
rich
man
enter
into
the
kingdom
God
Matthew
And
when
the
disciples
heard
they
were
astonished
exceedingly
saying
Who
then
can
saved
Matthew
And
Jesus
looking
upon
them
said
them
With
men
this
impossible
but
with
God
all
things
are
possible
Matthew
Then
answered
Peter
and
said
unto
him
have
left
all
and
followed
thee
what
then
shall
have
Matthew
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
Verily
say
unto
you
that
who
have
followed
the
regeneration
when
the
Son
man
shall
sit
the
throne
his
glory
also
shall
sit
upon
twelve
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
Israel
Matthew
And
every
one
that
hath
left
houses
brethren
sisters
father
mother
children
lands
for
name
sake
shall
receive
hundredfold
and
shall
inherit
eternal
life
Matthew
But
many
shall
last
that
are
first
and
first
that
are
last
Matthew
For
the
kingdom
heaven
like
unto
man
that
was
householder
who
went
out
early
the
morning
hire
laborers
into
his
vineyard
Matthew
And
when
had
agreed
with
the
laborers
for
shilling
day
sent
them
into
his
vineyard
Matthew
And
went
out
about
the
third
hour
and
saw
others
standing
the
marketplace
idle
Matthew
and
them
said
also
into
the
vineyard
and
whatsoever
right
will
give
you
And
they
went
their
way
Matthew
Again
went
out
about
the
sixth
and
the
ninth
hour
and
did
likewise
Matthew
And
about
the
eleventh
hour
went
out
and
found
others
standing
and
saith
unto
them
Why
stand
here
all
the
day
idle
Matthew
They
say
unto
him
Because
man
hath
hired
saith
unto
them
also
into
the
vineyard
Matthew
And
when
even
was
come
the
lord
the
vineyard
saith
unto
his
steward
Call
the
laborers
and
pay
them
their
hire
beginning
from
the
last
unto
the
first
Matthew
And
when
they
came
that
were
hired
about
the
eleventh
hour
they
received
every
man
shilling
Matthew
And
when
the
first
came
they
supposed
that
they
would
receive
more
and
they
likewise
received
every
man
shilling
Matthew
And
when
they
received
they
murmured
against
the
householder
Matthew
saying
These
last
have
spent
but
one
hour
and
thou
hast
made
them
equal
unto
who
have
borne
the
burden
the
day
and
the
scorching
heat
Matthew
But
answered
and
said
one
them
Friend
thee
wrong
didst
not
thou
agree
with
for
shilling
Matthew
Take
that
which
thine
and
thy
way
will
give
unto
this
last
even
unto
thee
Matthew
not
lawful
for
what
will
with
mine
own
thine
eye
evil
because
good
Matthew
the
last
shall
first
and
the
first
last
Matthew
And
Jesus
was
going
Jerusalem
took
the
twelve
disciples
apart
and
the
way
said
unto
them
Matthew
Behold
Jerusalem
and
the
Son
man
shall
delivered
unto
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
and
they
shall
condemn
him
death
Matthew
and
shall
deliver
him
unto
the
Gentiles
mock
and
scourge
and
crucify
and
the
third
day
shall
raised
Matthew
Then
came
him
the
mother
the
sons
Zebedee
with
her
sons
worshipping
him
and
asking
certain
thing
him
Matthew
And
said
unto
her
What
wouldest
thou
She
saith
unto
him
Command
that
these
two
sons
may
sit
one
thy
right
hand
and
one
thy
left
hand
thy
kingdom
Matthew
But
Jesus
answered
and
said
know
not
what
ask
Are
able
drink
the
cup
that
about
drink
They
say
unto
him
are
able
Matthew
saith
unto
them
cup
indeed
shall
drink
but
sit
right
hand
and
left
hand
not
mine
give
but
for
them
for
whom
hath
been
prepared
Father
Matthew
And
when
the
ten
heard
they
were
moved
with
indignation
concerning
the
two
brethren
Matthew
But
Jesus
called
them
unto
him
and
said
know
that
the
rulers
the
Gentiles
lord
over
them
and
their
great
ones
exercise
authority
over
them
Matthew
Not
shall
among
you
but
whosoever
would
become
great
among
you
shall
your
minister
Matthew
and
whosoever
would
first
among
you
shall
your
servant
Matthew
even
the
Son
man
came
not
ministered
unto
but
minister
and
give
his
life
ransom
for
many
Matthew
And
they
went
out
from
Jericho
great
multitude
followed
him
Matthew
And
behold
two
blind
men
sitting
the
way
side
when
they
heard
that
Jesus
was
passing
cried
out
saying
Lord
have
mercy
thou
son
David
Matthew
And
the
multitude
rebuked
them
that
they
should
hold
their
peace
but
they
cried
out
the
more
saying
Lord
have
mercy
thou
son
David
Matthew
And
Jesus
stood
still
and
called
them
and
said
What
will
that
should
unto
you
Matthew
They
say
unto
him
Lord
that
our
eyes
may
opened
Matthew
And
Jesus
being
moved
with
compassion
touched
their
eyes
and
straightway
they
received
their
sight
and
followed
him
Matthew
And
when
they
drew
nigh
unto
Jerusalem
and
came
unto
Bethphage
unto
the
mount
Olives
then
Jesus
sent
two
disciples
Matthew
saying
unto
them
into
the
village
that
over
against
you
and
straightway
shall
find
ass
tied
and
colt
with
her
loose
them
and
bring
them
unto
Matthew
And
any
one
say
aught
unto
you
shall
say
The
Lord
hath
need
them
and
straightway
will
send
them
Matthew
Now
this
come
pass
that
might
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
through
the
prophet
saying
Matthew
Tell
the
daughter
Zion
Behold
thy
King
cometh
unto
thee
Meek
and
riding
upon
ass
And
upon
colt
the
foal
ass
Matthew
And
the
disciples
went
and
did
even
Jesus
appointed
them
Matthew
and
brought
the
ass
and
the
colt
and
put
them
their
garments
and
sat
thereon
Matthew
And
the
most
part
the
multitude
spread
their
garments
the
way
and
others
cut
branches
from
the
trees
and
spread
them
the
way
Matthew
And
the
multitudes
that
went
before
him
and
that
followed
cried
saying
Hosanna
the
son
David
Blessed
that
cometh
the
name
the
Lord
Hosanna
the
highest
Matthew
And
when
was
come
into
Jerusalem
all
the
city
was
stirred
saying
Who
this
Matthew
And
the
multitudes
said
This
the
prophet
Jesus
from
Nazareth
Galilee
Matthew
And
Jesus
entered
into
the
temple
God
and
cast
out
all
them
that
sold
and
bought
the
temple
and
overthrew
the
tables
the
money
changers
and
the
seats
them
that
sold
the
doves
Matthew
and
saith
unto
them
written
house
shall
called
house
prayer
but
make
den
robbers
Matthew
And
the
blind
and
the
lame
came
him
the
temple
and
healed
them
Matthew
But
when
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
saw
the
wonderful
things
that
did
and
the
children
that
were
crying
the
temple
and
saying
Hosanna
the
son
David
they
were
moved
with
indignation
Matthew
and
said
unto
him
Hearest
thou
what
these
are
saying
And
Jesus
saith
unto
them
Yea
did
never
read
Out
the
mouth
babes
and
sucklings
thou
hast
perfected
praise
Matthew
And
left
them
and
went
forth
out
the
city
Bethany
and
lodged
there
Matthew
Now
the
morning
returned
the
city
hungered
Matthew
And
seeing
fig
tree
the
way
side
came
and
found
nothing
thereon
but
leaves
only
and
saith
unto
Let
there
fruit
from
thee
henceforward
for
ever
And
immediately
the
fig
tree
withered
away
Matthew
And
when
the
disciples
saw
they
marvelled
saying
How
did
the
fig
tree
immediately
wither
away
Matthew
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
Verily
say
unto
you
have
faith
and
doubt
not
shall
not
only
what
done
the
fig
tree
but
even
shall
say
unto
this
mountain
thou
taken
and
cast
into
the
sea
shall
done
Matthew
And
all
things
whatsoever
shall
ask
prayer
believing
shall
receive
Matthew
And
when
was
come
into
the
temple
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
the
people
came
unto
him
was
teaching
and
said
what
authority
doest
thou
these
things
and
who
gave
thee
this
authority
Matthew
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
also
will
ask
you
one
question
which
tell
likewise
will
tell
you
what
authority
these
things
Matthew
The
baptism
John
whence
was
from
heaven
from
men
And
they
reasoned
with
themselves
saying
shall
say
From
heaven
will
say
unto
Why
then
did
not
believe
him
Matthew
But
shall
say
From
men
fear
the
multitude
for
all
hold
John
prophet
Matthew
And
they
answered
Jesus
and
said
know
not
also
said
unto
them
Neither
tell
you
what
authority
these
things
Matthew
But
what
think
man
had
two
sons
and
came
the
first
and
said
Son
work
day
the
vineyard
Matthew
And
answered
and
said
will
not
but
afterward
repented
himself
and
went
Matthew
And
came
the
second
and
said
likewise
And
answered
and
said
sir
and
went
not
Matthew
Which
the
two
did
the
will
his
father
They
say
The
first
Jesus
saith
unto
them
Verily
say
unto
you
that
the
publicans
and
the
harlots
into
the
kingdom
God
before
you
Matthew
For
John
came
unto
you
the
way
righteousness
and
believed
him
not
but
the
publicans
and
the
harlots
believed
him
and
when
saw
did
not
even
repent
yourselves
afterward
that
might
believe
him
Matthew
Hear
another
parable
There
was
man
that
was
householder
who
planted
vineyard
and
set
hedge
about
and
digged
winepress
and
built
tower
and
let
out
husbandmen
and
went
into
another
country
Matthew
And
when
the
season
the
fruits
drew
near
sent
his
servants
the
husbandmen
receive
his
fruits
Matthew
And
the
husbandmen
took
his
servants
and
beat
one
and
killed
another
and
stoned
another
Matthew
Again
sent
other
servants
more
than
the
first
and
they
did
unto
them
like
manner
Matthew
But
afterward
sent
unto
them
his
son
saying
They
will
reverence
son
Matthew
But
the
husbandmen
when
they
saw
the
son
said
among
themselves
This
the
heir
come
let
kill
him
and
take
his
inheritance
Matthew
And
they
took
him
and
cast
him
forth
out
the
vineyard
and
killed
him
Matthew
When
therefore
the
lord
the
vineyard
shall
come
what
will
unto
those
husbandmen
Matthew
They
say
unto
him
will
miserably
destroy
those
miserable
men
and
will
let
out
the
vineyard
unto
other
husbandmen
who
shall
render
him
the
fruits
their
seasons
Matthew
Jesus
saith
unto
them
Did
never
read
the
scriptures
The
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
The
same
was
made
the
head
the
corner
This
was
from
the
Lord
And
marvelous
our
eyes
Matthew
Therefore
say
unto
you
The
kingdom
God
shall
taken
away
from
you
and
shall
given
nation
bringing
forth
the
fruits
thereof
Matthew
And
that
falleth
this
stone
shall
broken
pieces
but
whomsoever
shall
fall
will
scatter
him
dust
Matthew
And
when
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
heard
his
parables
they
perceived
that
spake
them
Matthew
And
when
they
sought
lay
hold
him
they
feared
the
multitudes
because
they
took
him
for
prophet
Matthew
And
Jesus
answered
and
spake
again
parables
unto
them
saying
Matthew
The
kingdom
heaven
likened
unto
certain
king
who
made
marriage
feast
for
his
son
Matthew
and
sent
forth
his
servants
call
them
that
were
bidden
the
marriage
feast
and
they
would
not
come
Matthew
Again
sent
forth
other
servants
saying
Tell
them
that
are
bidden
Behold
have
made
ready
dinner
oxen
and
fatlings
are
killed
and
all
things
are
ready
come
the
marriage
feast
Matthew
But
they
made
light
and
went
their
ways
one
his
own
farm
another
his
merchandise
Matthew
and
the
rest
laid
hold
his
servants
and
treated
them
shamefully
and
killed
them
Matthew
But
the
king
was
wroth
and
sent
his
armies
and
destroyed
those
murderers
and
burned
their
city
Matthew
Then
saith
his
servants
The
wedding
ready
but
they
that
were
bidden
were
not
worthy
Matthew
therefore
unto
the
partings
the
highways
and
many
shall
find
bid
the
marriage
feast
Matthew
And
those
servants
went
out
into
the
highways
and
gathered
together
all
many
they
found
both
bad
and
good
and
the
wedding
was
filled
with
guests
Matthew
But
when
the
king
came
behold
the
guests
saw
there
man
who
had
not
wedding
garment
Matthew
and
saith
unto
him
Friend
how
camest
thou
hither
not
having
wedding
garment
And
was
speechless
Matthew
Then
the
king
said
the
servants
Bind
him
hand
and
foot
and
cast
him
out
into
the
outer
darkness
there
shall
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
teeth
Matthew
For
many
are
called
but
few
chosen
Matthew
Then
went
the
Pharisees
and
took
counsel
how
they
might
ensnare
him
his
talk
Matthew
And
they
send
him
their
disciples
with
the
Herodians
saying
Teacher
know
that
thou
art
true
and
teachest
the
way
God
truth
and
carest
not
for
any
one
for
thou
regardest
not
the
person
men
Matthew
Tell
therefore
What
thinkest
thou
lawful
give
tribute
unto
Cæsar
not
Matthew
But
Jesus
perceived
their
wickedness
and
said
Why
make
trial
hypocrites
Matthew
Show
the
tribute
money
And
they
brought
unto
him
denarius
Matthew
And
saith
unto
them
Whose
this
image
and
superscription
Matthew
They
say
unto
him
Cæsar
Then
saith
unto
them
Render
therefore
unto
Cæsar
the
things
that
are
Cæsar
and
unto
God
the
things
that
are
God
Matthew
And
when
they
heard
they
marvelled
and
left
him
and
went
away
Matthew
that
day
there
came
him
Sadducees
they
that
say
that
there
resurrection
and
they
asked
him
Matthew
saying
Teacher
Moses
said
man
die
having
children
his
brother
shall
marry
his
wife
and
raise
seed
unto
his
brother
Matthew
Now
there
were
with
seven
brethren
and
the
first
married
and
deceased
and
having
seed
left
his
wife
unto
his
brother
Matthew
like
manner
the
second
also
and
the
third
unto
the
seventh
Matthew
And
after
them
all
the
woman
died
Matthew
the
resurrection
therefore
whose
wife
shall
she
the
seven
for
they
all
had
her
Matthew
But
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
err
not
knowing
the
scriptures
nor
the
power
God
Matthew
For
the
resurrection
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
marriage
but
are
angels
heaven
Matthew
But
touching
the
resurrection
the
dead
have
not
read
that
which
was
spoken
unto
you
God
saying
Matthew
the
God
Abraham
and
the
God
Isaac
and
the
God
Jacob
God
not
the
God
the
dead
but
the
living
Matthew
And
when
the
multitudes
heard
they
were
astonished
his
teaching
Matthew
But
the
Pharisees
when
they
heard
that
had
put
the
Sadducees
silence
gathered
themselves
together
Matthew
And
one
them
lawyer
asked
him
question
trying
him
Matthew
Teacher
which
the
great
commandment
the
law
Matthew
And
said
unto
him
Thou
shalt
love
the
Lord
thy
God
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
mind
Matthew
This
the
great
and
first
commandment
Matthew
And
second
like
unto
this
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
thyself
Matthew
these
two
commandments
the
whole
law
hangeth
and
the
prophets
Matthew
Now
while
the
Pharisees
were
gathered
together
Jesus
asked
them
question
Matthew
saying
What
think
the
Christ
whose
son
They
say
unto
him
The
son
David
Matthew
saith
unto
them
How
then
doth
David
the
Spirit
call
him
Lord
saying
Matthew
The
Lord
said
unto
Lord
Sit
thou
right
hand
Till
put
thine
enemies
underneath
thy
feet
Matthew
David
then
calleth
him
Lord
how
his
son
Matthew
And
one
was
able
answer
him
word
neither
durst
any
man
from
that
day
forth
ask
him
any
more
questions
Matthew
Then
spake
Jesus
the
multitudes
and
his
disciples
Matthew
saying
The
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
sit
Moses
seat
Matthew
all
things
therefore
whatsoever
they
bid
you
these
and
observe
but
not
after
their
works
for
they
say
and
not
Matthew
Yea
they
bind
heavy
burdens
and
grievous
borne
and
lay
them
men
shoulders
but
they
themselves
will
not
move
them
with
their
finger
Matthew
But
all
their
works
they
seen
men
for
they
make
broad
their
phylacteries
and
enlarge
the
borders
their
garments
Matthew
and
love
the
chief
place
feasts
and
the
chief
seats
the
synagogues
Matthew
and
the
salutations
the
marketplaces
and
called
men
Rabbi
Matthew
But
not
called
Rabbi
for
one
your
teacher
and
all
are
brethren
Matthew
And
call
man
your
father
the
earth
for
one
your
Father
even
who

Matthew
Neither
called
masters
for
one
your
master
even
the
Christ
Matthew
But
that
greatest
among
you
shall
your
servant
Matthew
And
whosoever
shall
exalt
himself
shall
humbled
and
whosoever
shall
humble
himself
shall
exalted
Matthew
But
woe
unto
you

and
Pharisees
hypocrites
because
shut
the
kingdom

against
men
for
enter
not
yourselves
neither
suffer
them

Matthew
Woe

hypocrites
for

and
when

make
him

Matthew
Woe

And
Whosoever

And

Matthew
And

Matthew
Woe
unto
you

tithe
mint
and
anise
and
cummin
and
have
left
undone
the
weightier

Matthew
blind

Matthew
Woe
unto
you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
for
cleanse
the
outside
the
cup
and
the
platter
but
within
they
are
full
from
extortion
and
excess
Matthew
Thou
blind
Pharisee
cleanse
first
the
inside
the
cup
and
the
platter
that
the
outside
thereof
may
become
clean
also
Matthew
Woe
unto
you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
for
are
like
unto
whited
sepulchres
which
outwardly
appear
beautiful
but
inwardly
are
full
dead
men
bones
and
all
uncleanness
Matthew
Even
also
outwardly
appear
righteous
unto
men
but
inwardly
are
full
hypocrisy
and
iniquity
Matthew
Woe
unto
you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
for
build
the
sepulchres
the
prophets
and
garnish
the
tombs
the
righteous
Matthew
and
say
had
been
the
days
our
fathers
should
not
have
been
partakers
with
them
the
blood

Wherefore
witness
yourselves
that
are

Matthew
Fill
then
the
measure
your
fathers

Matthew
Therefore
behold
send
unto
you
prophets
and
wise
men
and
scribes
some
them
shall
kill
and
crucify
and
some
them
shall
scourge
your
synagogues
and
persecute
from
city

that
upon
you
may
come
all
the
righteous

Zachariah
son
Barachiah

slew

the
sanctuary
and

altar
Matthew
Verily
say
unto
you
All
these
things
shall
come
upon
this
generation
Matthew
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
that
killeth
the
prophets
and
stoneth
them
that
are
sent
unto
her
how
often
would
have
gathered
thy
children
together
even
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings
and
would
not
Matthew
Behold
your
house
left
unto
you
desolate
Matthew
For
say
unto
you
shall
not
see
henceforth
till
shall
say
Blessed
that
cometh
the
name
the
Lord
Matthew
And
Jesus
went
out
from
the
temple
and
was
going
his
way
and
his
disciples
came
him
show
him
the
buildings
the
temple
Matthew
But
answered
and
said
unto
them
See
not
all
these
things
verily
say
unto
you
There
shall
not
left
here
one
stone
upon
another
that
shall
not
thrown
down
Matthew
And
sat
the
mount
Olives
the
disciples
came
unto
him
privately
saying
Tell
when
shall
these
things
and
what
shall
the
sign
thy
coming
and
the
end
the
world
Matthew
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
Take
heed
that
man
lead
you
astray
Matthew
For
many
shall
come
name
saying
the
Christ
and
shall
lead
many
astray
Matthew
And
shall
hear
wars
and
rumors
wars
see
that
not
troubled
for
these
things
must
needs
come
pass
but
the
end
not
yet
Matthew
For
nation
shall
rise
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
and
there
shall
famines
and
earthquakes
divers
places
Matthew
But
all
these
things
are
the
beginning
travail
Matthew
Then
shall
they
deliver
you
unto
tribulation
and
shall
kill
you
and
shall
hated
all
the
nations
for
name
sake
Matthew
And
then
shall
many
stumble
and
shall
deliver
one
another
and
shall
hate
one
another
Matthew
And
many
false
prophets
shall
arise
and
shall
lead
many
astray
Matthew
And
because
iniquity
shall
multiplied
the
love
the
many
shall
wax
cold
Matthew
But
that
endureth
the
end
the
same
shall
saved
Matthew
And
this
gospel
the
kingdom
shall
preached
the
whole
world
for
testimony
unto
all
the
nations
and
then
shall
the
end
come
Matthew
When
therefore
see
the
abomination
desolation
which
was
spoken
through
Daniel
the
prophet
standing
the
holy
place
let
him
that
readeth
understand
Matthew
then
let
them
that
are
Judæa
flee
unto
the
mountains
Matthew
let
him
that
the
housetop
not
down
take
out
the
things
that
are
his
house
Matthew
and
let
him
that
the
field
not
return
back
take
his
cloak
Matthew
But
woe
unto
them
that
are
with
child
and
them
that
give
suck
those
days
Matthew
And
pray
that
your
flight
not
the
winter
neither
sabbath
Matthew
for
then
shall
great
tribulation
such
hath
not
been
from
the
beginning
the
world
until
now
nor
ever
shall
Matthew
And
except
those
days
had
been
shortened
flesh
would
have
been
saved
but
for
the
elect
sake
those
days
shall
shortened
Matthew
Then
any
man
shall
say
unto
you
here
the
Christ
Here
believe
not
Matthew
For
there
shall
arise
false
Christs
and
false
prophets
and
shall
show
great
signs
and
wonders
lead
astray
possible
even
the
elect
Matthew
Behold
have
told
you
beforehand
Matthew
therefore
they
shall
say
unto
you
Behold
the
wilderness
not
forth
Behold
the
inner
chambers
believe
not
Matthew
For
the
lightning
cometh
forth
from
the
east
and
seen
even
unto
the
west
shall
the
coming
the
Son
man
Matthew
Wheresoever
the
carcase
there
will
the
eagles
gathered
together
Matthew
But
immediately
after
the
tribulation
those
days
the
sun
shall
darkened
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light
and
the
stars
shall
fall
from
heaven
and
the
powers
the
heavens
shall
shaken
Matthew
and
then
shall
appear
the
sign
the
Son
man
heaven
and
then
shall
all
the
tribes
the
earth
mourn
and
they
shall
see
the
Son
man
coming
the
clouds
heaven
with
power
and
great
glory
Matthew
And
shall
send
forth
his
angels
with
great
sound
trumpet
and
they
shall
gather
together
his
elect
from
the
four
winds
from
one
end
heaven
the
other
Matthew
Now
from
the
fig
tree
learn
her
parable
when
her
branch
now
become
tender
and
putteth
forth
its
leaves
know
that
the
summer
nigh
Matthew
even
also
when
see
all
these
things
know
that
nigh
even
the
doors
Matthew
Verily
say
unto
you
This
generation
shall
not
pass
away
till
all
these
things
accomplished
Matthew
Heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
away
but
words
shall
not
pass
away
Matthew
But
that
day
and
hour
knoweth
one
not
even
the
angels
heaven
neither
the
Son
but
the
Father
only
Matthew
And
were
the
days
Noah
shall
the
coming
the
Son
man
Matthew
For
those
days
which
were
before
the
flood
they
were
eating
and
drinking
marrying
and
giving
marriage
until
the
day
that
Noah
entered
into
the
ark
Matthew
and
they
knew
not
until
the
flood
came
and
took
them
all
away
shall
the
coming
the
Son
man
Matthew
Then
shall
two
men
the
field
one
taken
and
one
left
Matthew
two
women
shall
grinding
the
mill
one
taken
and
one
left
Matthew
Watch
therefore
for
know
not
what
day
your
Lord
cometh
Matthew
But
know
this
that
the
master
the
house
had
known
what
watch
the
thief
was
coming
would
have
watched
and
would
not
have
suffered
his
house
broken
through
Matthew
Therefore
also
ready
for
hour
that
think
not
the
Son
man
cometh
Matthew
Who
then
the
faithful
and
wise
servant
whom
his
lord
hath
set
over
his
household
give
them
their
food
due
season
Matthew
Blessed
that
servant
whom
his
lord
when
cometh
shall
find
doing
Matthew
Verily
say
unto
you
that
will
set
him
over
all
that
hath
Matthew
But
that
evil
servant
shall
say
his
heart
lord
tarrieth
Matthew
and
shall
begin
beat
his
fellow
servants
and
shall
eat
and
drink
with
the
drunken
Matthew
the
lord
that
servant
shall
come
day
when
expecteth
not
and
hour
when
knoweth
not
Matthew
and
shall
cut
him
asunder
and
appoint
his
portion
with
the
hypocrites
there
shall
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
teeth
Matthew
Then
shall
the
kingdom
heaven
likened
unto
ten
virgins
who
took
their
lamps
and
went
forth
meet
the
bridegroom
Matthew
And
five
them
were
foolish
and
five
were
wise
Matthew
For
the
foolish
when
they
took
their
lamps
took
oil
with
them
Matthew
but
the
wise
took
oil
their
vessels
with
their
lamps
Matthew
Now
while
the
bridegroom
tarried
they
all
slumbered
and
slept
Matthew
But
midnight
there
cry
Behold
the
bridegroom
Come
forth
meet
him
Matthew
Then
all
those
virgins
arose
and
trimmed
their
lamps
Matthew
And
the
foolish
said
unto
the
wise
Give
your
oil
for
our
lamps
are
going
out
Matthew
But
the
wise
answered
saying
Peradventure
there
will
not
enough
for
and
you
rather
them
that
sell
and
buy
for
yourselves
Matthew
And
while
they
went
away
buy
the
bridegroom
came
and
they
that
were
ready
went
with
him
the
marriage
feast
and
the
door
was
shut
Matthew
Afterward
came
also
the
other
virgins
saying
Lord
Lord
open
Matthew
But
answered
and
said
Verily
say
unto
you
know
you
not
Matthew
Watch
therefore
for
know
not
the
day
nor
the
hour
Matthew
For
when
man
going
into
another
country
called
his
own
servants
and
delivered
unto
them
his
goods
Matthew
And
unto
one
gave
five
talents
another
two
another
one
each
according
his
several
ability
and
went
his
journey
Matthew
Straightway
that
received
the
five
talents
went
and
traded
with
them
and
made
other
five
talents
Matthew
like
manner
also
that
received
the
two
gained
other
two
Matthew
But
that
received
the
one
went
away
and
digged
the
earth
and
hid
his
lord
money
Matthew
Now
after
long
time
the
lord
those
servants
cometh
and
maketh
reckoning
with
them
Matthew
And
that
received
the
five
talents
came
and
brought
other
five
talents
saying
Lord
thou
deliveredst
unto
five
talents
have
gained
other
five
talents
Matthew
His
lord
said
unto
him
Well
done
good
and
faithful
servant
thou
hast
been
faithful
over
few
things
will
set
thee
over
many
things
enter
thou
into
the
joy
thy
lord
Matthew
And
also
that
received
the
two
talents
came
and
said
Lord
thou
deliveredst
unto
two
talents
have
gained
other
two
talents
Matthew
His
lord
said
unto
him
Well
done
good
and
faithful
servant
thou
hast
been
faithful
over
few
things
will
set
thee
over
many
things
enter
thou
into
the
joy
thy
lord
Matthew
And
also
that
had
received
the
one
talent
came
and
said
Lord
knew
thee
that
thou
art
hard
man
reaping
where
thou
didst
not
sow
and
gathering
where
thou
didst
not
scatter
Matthew
and
was
afraid
and
went
away
and
hid
thy
talent
the
earth
thou
hast
thine
own
Matthew
But
his
lord
answered
and
said
unto
him
Thou
wicked
and
slothful
servant
thou
knewest
that
reap
where
sowed
not
and
gather
where
did
not
scatter
Matthew
thou
oughtest
therefore
have
put
money
the
bankers
and
coming
should
have
received
back
mine
own
with
interest
Matthew
Take
away
therefore
the
talent
from
him
and
give
unto
him
that
hath
the
ten
talents
Matthew
For
unto
every
one
that
hath
shall
given
and
shall
have
abundance
but
from
him
that
hath
not
even
that
which
hath
shall
taken
away
Matthew
And
cast
out
the
unprofitable
servant
into
the
outer
darkness
there
shall
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
teeth
Matthew
But
when
the
Son
man
shall
come
his
glory
and
all
the
angels
with
him
then
shall
sit
the
throne
his
glory
Matthew
and
before
him
shall
gathered
all
the
nations
and
shall
separate
them
one
from
another
the
shepherd
separateth
the
sheep
from
the
goats
Matthew
and
shall
set
the
sheep
his
right
hand
but
the
goats
the
left
Matthew
Then
shall
the
King
say
unto
them
his
right
hand
Come
blessed
Father
inherit
the
kingdom
prepared
for
you
from
the
foundation
the
world
Matthew
for
was
hungry
and
gave
eat
was
thirsty
and
gave
drink
was
stranger
and
took
Matthew
naked
and
clothed
was
sick
and
visited
was
prison
and
came
unto
Matthew
Then
shall
the
righteous
answer
him
saying
Lord
when
saw
thee
hungry
and
fed
thee
athirst
and
gave
thee
drink
Matthew
And
when
saw
thee
stranger
and
took
thee
naked
and
clothed
thee
Matthew
And
when
saw
thee
sick
prison
and
came
unto
thee
Matthew
And
the
King
shall
answer
and
say
unto
them
Verily
say
unto
you
Inasmuch
did
unto
one
these
brethren
even
these
least
did
unto
Matthew
Then
shall
say
also
unto
them
the
left
hand
Depart
from
cursed
into
the
eternal
fire
which
prepared
for
the
devil
and
his
angels
Matthew
for
was
hungry
and
did
not
give
eat
was
thirsty
and
gave
drink
Matthew
was
stranger
and
took
not
naked
and
clothed
not
sick
and
prison
and
visited
not
Matthew
Then
shall
they
also
answer
saying
Lord
when
saw
thee
hungry
athirst
stranger
naked
sick
prison
and
did
not
minister
unto
thee
Matthew
Then
shall
answer
them
saying
Verily
say
unto
you
Inasmuch
did
not
unto
one
these
least
did
not
unto
Matthew
And
these
shall
away
into
eternal
punishment
but
the
righteous
into
eternal
life
Matthew
And
came
pass
when
Jesus
had
finished
all
these
words
said
unto
his
disciples
Matthew
know
that
after
two
days
the
passover
cometh
and
the
Son
man
delivered
crucified
Matthew
Then
were
gathered
together
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
the
people
unto
the
court
the
high
priest
who
was
called
Caiaphas
Matthew
and
they
took
counsel
together
that
they
might
take
Jesus
subtlety
and
kill
him
Matthew
But
they
said
Not
during
the
feast
lest
tumult
arise
among
the
people
Matthew
Now
when
Jesus
was
Bethany
the
house
Simon
the
leper
Matthew
there
came
unto
him
woman
having
alabaster
cruse
exceeding
precious
ointment
and
she
poured
upon
his
head
sat
meat
Matthew
But
when
the
disciples
saw
they
had
indignation
saying
what
purpose
this
waste
Matthew
For
this
ointment
might
have
been
sold
for
much
and
given
the
poor
Matthew
But
Jesus
perceiving
said
unto
them
Why
trouble
the
woman
for
she
hath
wrought
good
work
upon
Matthew
For
have
the
poor
always
with
you
but
have
not
always
Matthew
For
that
she
poured
this
ointment
upon
body
she
did
prepare
for
burial
Matthew
Verily
say
unto
you
Wheresoever
this
gospel
shall
preached
the
whole
world
that
also
which
this
woman
hath
done
shall
spoken
for
memorial
her
Matthew
Then
one
the
twelve
who
was
called
Judas
Iscariot
went
unto
the
chief
priests
Matthew
and
said
What
are
willing
give
and
will
deliver
him
unto
you
And
they
weighed
unto
him
thirty
pieces
silver
Matthew
And
from
that
time
sought
opportunity
deliver
him
unto
them
Matthew
Now
the
first
day
unleavened
bread
the
disciples
came
Jesus
saying
Where
wilt
thou
that
make
ready
for
thee
eat
the
passover
Matthew
And
said
into
the
city
such
man
and
say
unto
him
The
Teacher
saith
time
hand
keep
the
passover
thy
house
with
disciples
Matthew
And
the
disciples
did
Jesus
appointed
them
and
they
made
ready
the
passover
Matthew
Now
when
even
was
come
was
sitting
meat
with
the
twelve
disciples
Matthew
and
they
were
eating
said
Verily
say
unto
you
that
one
you
shal
betray
Matthew
And
they
were
exceeding
sorrowful
and
began
say
unto
him
every
one
Lord
Matthew
And
answered
and
said
that
dipped
his
hand
with
the
dish
the
same
shall
betray
Matthew
The
Son
man
goeth
even
written
him
but
woe
unto
that
man
through
whom
the
Son
man
betrayed
good
were
for
that
man
had
not
been
born
Matthew
And
Judas
who
betrayed
him
answered
and
said
Rabbi
saith
unto
him
Thou
hast
said
Matthew
And
they
were
eating
Jesus
took
bread
and
blessed
and
brake
and
gave
the
disciples
and
said
Take
eat
this
body
Matthew
And
took
cup
and
gave
thanks
and
gave
them
saying
Drink
all
Matthew
for
this
blood
the
covenant
which
poured
out
for
many
unto
remission
sins
Matthew
But
say
unto
you
shall
not
drink
henceforth
this
fruit
the
vine
until
that
day
when
drink
new
with
you
Father
kingdom
Matthew
And
when
they
had
sung
hymn
they
went
out
unto
the
mount
Olives
Matthew
Then
saith
Jesus
unto
them
All
shall
offended
this
night
for
written
will
smite
the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
the
flock
shall
scattered
abroad
Matthew
But
after
raised
will
before
you
into
Galilee
Matthew
But
Peter
answered
and
said
unto
him
all
shall
offended
thee
will
never
offended
Matthew
Jesus
said
unto
him
Verily
say
unto
thee
that
this
night
before
the
cock
crow
thou
shalt
deny
thrice
Matthew
Peter
saith
unto
him
Even
must
die
with
thee
yet
will
not
deny
thee
Likewise
also
said
all
the
disciples
Matthew
Then
cometh
Jesus
with
them
unto
place
called
Gethsemane
and
saith
unto
his
disciples
Sit
here
while
yonder
and
pray
Matthew
And
took
with
him
Peter
and
the
two
sons
Zebedee
and
began
sorrowful
and
sore
troubled
Matthew
Then
saith
unto
them
soul
exceeding
sorrowful
even
unto
death
abide
here
and
watch
with
Matthew
And
went
forward
little
and
fell
his
face
and
prayed
saying
Father
possible
let
this
cup
pass
away
from
nevertheless
not
will
but
thou
wilt
Matthew
And
cometh
unto
the
disciples
and
findeth
them
sleeping
and
saith
unto
Peter
What
could
not
watch
with
one
hour
Matthew
Watch
and
pray
that
enter
not
into
temptation
the
spirit
indeed
willing
but
the
flesh
weak
Matthew
Again
second
time
went
away
and
prayed
saying
Father
this
cannot
pass
away
except
drink
thy
will
done
Matthew
And
came
again
and
found
them
sleeping
for
their
eyes
were
heavy
Matthew
And
left
them
again
and
went
away
and
prayed
third
time
saying
again
the
same
words
Matthew
Then
cometh
the
disciples
and
saith
unto
them
Sleep
now
and
take
your
rest
behold
the
hour
hand
and
the
Son
man
betrayed
into
the
hands
sinners
Matthew
Arise
let
going
behold
hand
that
betrayeth
Matthew
And
while
yet
spake
Judas
one
the
twelve
came
and
with
him
great
multitude
with
swords
and
staves
from
the
chief
priests
and
elders
the
people
Matthew
Now
that
betrayed
him
gave
them
sign
saying
Whomsoever
shall
kiss
that
take
him
Matthew
And
straightway
came
Jesus
and
said
Hail
Rabbi
and
kissed
him
Matthew
And
Jesus
said
unto
him
Friend
that
for
which
thou
art
come
Then
they
came
and
laid
hands
Jesus
and
took
him
Matthew
And
behold
one
them
that
were
with
Jesus
stretched
out
his
hand
and
drew
his
sword
and
smote
the
servant
the
high
priest
and
struck
off
his
ear
Matthew
Then
saith
Jesus
unto
him
Put
again
thy
sword
into
its
place
for
all
they
that
take
the
sword
shall
perish
with
the
sword
Matthew
thinkest
thou
that
cannot
beseech
Father
and
shall
even
now
send
more
than
twelve
legions
angels
Matthew
How
then
should
the
scriptures
fulfilled
that
thus
must
Matthew
that
hour
said
Jesus
the
multitudes
Are
come
out
against
robber
with
swords
and
staves
seize
sat
daily
the
temple
teaching
and
took
not
Matthew
But
all
this
come
pass
that
the
scriptures
the
prophets
might
fulfilled
Then
all
the
disciples
left
him
and
fled
Matthew
And
they
that
had
taken
Jesus
led
him
away
the
house
Caiaphas
the
high
priest
where
the
scribes
and
the
elders
were
gathered
together
Matthew
But
Peter
followed
him
afar
off
unto
the
court
the
high
priest
and
entered
and
sat
with
the
officers
see
the
end
Matthew
Now
the
chief
priests
and
the
whole
council
sought
false
witness
against
Jesus
that
they
might
put
him
death
Matthew
and
they
found
not
though
many
false
witnesses
came
But
afterward
came
two
Matthew
and
said
This
man
said
able
destroy
the
temple
God
and
build
three
days
Matthew
And
the
high
priest
stood
and
said
unto
him
Answerest
thou
nothing
what
which
these
witness
against
thee
Matthew
But
Jesus
held
his
peace
And
the
high
priest
said
unto
him
adjure
thee
the
living
God
that
thou
tell
whether
thou
art
the
Christ
the
Son
God
Matthew
Jesus
saith
unto
him
Thou
hast
said
nevertheless
say
unto
you
Henceforth
shall
see
the
Son
man
sitting
the
right
hand
Power
and
coming
the
clouds
heaven
Matthew
Then
the
high
priest
rent
his
garments
saying
hath
spoken
blasphemy
what
further
need
have
witnesses
behold
now
have
heard
the
blasphemy
Matthew
what
think
They
answered
and
said
worthy
death
Matthew
Then
did
they
spit
his
face
and
buffet
him
and
some
smote
him
with
the
palms
their
hands
Matthew
saying
Prophesy
unto
thou
Christ
who
that
struck
thee
Matthew
Now
Peter
was
sitting
without
the
court
and
maid
came
unto
him
saying
Thou
also
wast
with
Jesus
the
Galilæan
Matthew
But
denied
before
them
all
saying
know
not
what
thou
sayest
Matthew
And
when
was
gone
out
into
the
porch
another
maid
saw
him
and
saith
unto
them
that
were
there
This
man
also
was
with
Jesus
Nazareth
Matthew
And
again
denied
with
oath
know
not
the
man
Matthew
And
after
little
while
they
that
stood
came
and
said
Peter
truth
thou
also
art
one
them
for
thy
speech
maketh
thee
known
Matthew
Then
began
curse
and
swear
know
not
the
man
And
straightway
the
cock
crew
Matthew
And
Peter
remembered
the
word
which
Jesus
had
said
Before
the
cock
crow
thou
shalt
deny
thrice
And
went
out
and
wept
bitterly
Matthew
Now
when
morning
was
come
all
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
the
people
took
counsel
against
Jesus
put
him
death
Matthew
and
they
bound
him
and
led
him
away
and
delivered
him
Pilate
the
governor
Matthew
Then
Judas
who
betrayed
him
when
saw
that
was
condemned
repented
himself
and
brought
back
the
thirty
pieces
silver
the
chief
priests
and
elders
Matthew
saying
have
sinned
that
betrayed
innocent
blood
But
they
said
What
that
see
thou
Matthew
And
cast
down
the
pieces
silver
into
the
sanctuary
and
departed
and
went
away
and
hanged
himself
Matthew
And
the
chief
priests
took
the
pieces
silver
and
said
not
lawful
put
them
into
the
treasury
since
the
price
blood
Matthew
And
they
took
counsel
and
bought
with
them
the
potter
field
bury
strangers
Matthew
Wherefore
that
field
was
called
The
field
blood
unto
this
day
Matthew
Then
was
fulfilled
that
which
was
spoken
through
Jeremiah
the
prophet
saying
And
they
took
the
thirty
pieces
silver
the
price
him
that
was
priced
whom
certain
the
children
Israel
did
price
Matthew
and
they
gave
them
for
the
potter
field
the
Lord
appointed
Matthew
Now
Jesus
stood
before
the
governor
and
the
governor
asked
him
saying
Art
thou
the
King
the
Jews
And
Jesus
said
unto
him
Thou
sayest
Matthew
And
when
was
accused
the
chief
priests
and
elders
answered
nothing
Matthew
Then
saith
Pilate
unto
him
Hearest
thou
not
how
many
things
they
witness
against
thee
Matthew
And
gave
him
answer
not
even
one
word
insomuch
that
the
governor
marvelled
greatly
Matthew
Now
the
feast
the
governor
was
wont
release
unto
the
multitude
one
prisoner
whom
they
would
Matthew
And
they
had
then
notable
prisoner
called
Barabbas
Matthew
When
therefore
they
were
gathered
together
Pilate
said
unto
them
Whom
will
that
release
unto
you
Barabbas
Jesus
who
called
Christ
Matthew
For
knew
that
for
envy
they
had
delivered
him
Matthew
And
while
was
sitting
the
judgment
seat
his
wife
sent
unto
him
saying
Have
thou
nothing
with
that
righteous
man
for
have
suffered
many
things
this
day
dream
because
him
Matthew
Now
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
persuaded
the
multitudes
that
they
should
ask
for
Barabbas
and
destroy
Jesus
Matthew
But
the
governor
answered
and
said
unto
them
Which
the
two
will
that
release
unto
you
And
they
said
Barabbas
Matthew
Pilate
saith
unto
them
What
then
shall
unto
Jesus
who
called
Christ
They
all
say
Let
him
crucified
Matthew
And
said
Why
what
evil
hath
done
But
they
cried
out
exceedingly
saying
Let
him
crucified
Matthew
when
Pilate
saw
that
prevailed
nothing
but
rather
that
tumult
was
arising
took
water
and
washed
his
hands
before
the
multitude
saying
innocent
the
blood
this
righteous
man
see
Matthew
And
all
the
people
answered
and
said
His
blood
and
our
children
Matthew
Then
released
unto
them
Barabbas
but
Jesus
scourged
and
delivered
crucified
Matthew
Then
the
soldiers
the
governor
took
Jesus
into
the
Prætorium
and
gathered
unto
him
the
whole
band
Matthew
And
they
stripped
him
and
put
him
scarlet
robe
Matthew
And
they
platted
crown
thorns
and
put
upon
his
head
and
reed
his
right
hand
and
they
kneeled
down
before
him
and
mocked
him
saying
Hail
King
the
Jews
Matthew
And
they
spat
upon
him
and
took
the
reed
and
smote
him
the
head
Matthew
And
when
they
had
mocked
him
they
took
off
from
him
the
robe
and
put
him
his
garments
and
led
him
away
crucify
him
Matthew
And
they
came
out
they
found
man
Cyrene
Simon
name
him
they
compelled
with
them
that
might
bear
his
cross
Matthew
And
when
they
were
come
unto
place
called
Golgotha
that
say
The
place
skull
Matthew
they
gave
him
wine
drink
mingled
with
gall
and
when
had
tasted
would
not
drink
Matthew
And
when
they
had
crucified
him
they
parted
his
garments
among
them
casting
lots
Matthew
and
they
sat
and
watched
him
there
Matthew
And
they
set
over
his
head
his
accusation
written
THIS
JESUS
THE
KING
THE
JEWS
Matthew
Then
are
there
crucified
with
him
two
robbers
one
the
right
hand
and
one
the
left
Matthew
And
they
that
passed
railed
him
wagging
their
heads
Matthew
and
saying
Thou
that
destroyest
the
temple
and
buildest
three
days
save
thyself
thou
art
the
Son
God
come
down
from
the
cross
Matthew
like
manner
also
the
chief
priests
mocking
him
with
the
scribes
and
elders
said
Matthew
saved
others
himself
cannot
save
the
King
Israel
let
him
now
come
down
from
the
cross
and
will
believe
him
Matthew
trusteth
God
let
him
deliver
him
now
desireth
him
for
said
the
Son
God
Matthew
And
the
robbers
also
that
were
crucified
with
him
cast
upon
him
the
same
reproach
Matthew
Now
from
the
sixth
hour
there
was
darkness
over
all
the
land
until
the
ninth
hour
Matthew
And
about
the
ninth
hour
Jesus
cried
with
loud
voice
saying
Eli
Eli
lama
sabachthani
that
God
God
why
hast
thou
forsaken
Matthew
And
some
them
that
stood
there
when
they
heard
said
This
man
calleth
Elijah
Matthew
And
straightway
one
them
ran
and
took
sponge
and
filled
with
vinegar
and
put
reed
and
gave
him
drink
Matthew
And
the
rest
said
Let
let
see
whether
Elijah
cometh
save
him
Matthew
And
Jesus
cried
again
with
loud
voice
and
yielded
his
spirit
Matthew
And
behold
the
veil
the
temple
was
rent
two
from
the
top
the
bottom
and
the
earth
did
quake
and
the
rocks
were
rent
Matthew
and
the
tombs
were
opened
and
many
bodies
the
saints
that
had
fallen
asleep
were
raised
Matthew
and
coming
forth
out
the
tombs
after
his
resurrection
they
entered
into
the
holy
city
and
appeared
unto
many
Matthew
Now
the
centurion
and
they
that
were
with
him
watching
Jesus
when
they
saw
the
earthquake
and
the
things
that
were
done
feared
exceedingly
saying
Truly
this
was
the
Son
God
Matthew
And
many
women
were
there
beholding
from
afar
who
had
followed
Jesus
from
Galilee
ministering
unto
him
Matthew
among
whom
was
Mary
Magdalene
and
Mary
the
mother
James
and
Joses
and
the
mother
the
sons
Zebedee
Matthew
And
when
even
was
come
there
came
rich
man
from
Arimathæa
named
Joseph
who
also
himself
was
Jesus
disciple
Matthew
this
man
went
Pilate
and
asked
for
the
body
Jesus
Then
Pilate
commanded
given
Matthew
And
Joseph
took
the
body
and
wrapped
clean
linen
cloth
Matthew
and
laid
his
own
new
tomb
which
had
hewn
out
the
rock
and
rolled
great
stone
the
door
the
tomb
and
departed
Matthew
And
Mary
Magdalene
was
there
and
the
other
Mary
sitting
over
against
the
sepulchre
Matthew
Now
the
morrow
which
the
day
after
the
Preparation
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
were
gathered
together
unto
Pilate
Matthew
saying
Sir
remember
that
that
deceiver
said
while
was
yet
alive
After
three
days
rise
again
Matthew
Command
therefore
that
the
sepulchre
made
sure
until
the
third
day
lest
haply
his
disciples
come
and
steal
him
away
and
say
unto
the
people
risen
from
the
dead
and
the
last
error
will
worse
than
the
first
Matthew
Pilate
said
unto
them
have
guard
make
sure
can
Matthew
they
went
and
made
the
sepulchre
sure
sealing
the
stone
the
guard
being
with
them
Matthew
Now
late
the
sabbath
day
began
dawn
toward
the
first
day
the
week
came
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
other
Mary
see
the
sepulchre
Matthew
And
behold
there
was
great
earthquake
for
angel
the
Lord
descended
from
heaven
and
came
and
rolled
away
the
stone
and
sat
upon
Matthew
His
appearance
was
lightning
and
his
raiment
white
snow
Matthew
and
for
fear
him
the
watchers
did
quake
and
became
dead
men
Matthew
And
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
the
women
Fear
not
for
know
that
seek
Jesus
who
hath
been
crucified
Matthew
not
here
for
risen
even
said
Come
see
the
place
where
the
Lord
lay
Matthew
And
quickly
and
tell
his
disciples
risen
from
the
dead
and
goeth
before
you
into
Galilee
there
shall
see
him
have
told
you
Matthew
And
they
departed
quickly
from
the
tomb
with
fear
and
great
joy
and
ran
bring
his
disciples
word
Matthew
And
behold
Jesus
met
them
saying
All
hail
And
they
came
and
took
hold
his
feet
and
worshipped
him
Matthew
Then
saith
Jesus
unto
them
Fear
not
tell
brethren
that
they
depart
into
Galilee
and
there
shall
they
see
Matthew
Now
while
they
were
going
behold
some
the
guard
came
into
the
city
and
told
unto
the
chief
priests
all
the
things
that
were
come
pass
Matthew
And
when
they
were
assembled
with
the
elders
and
had
taken
counsel
they
gave
much
money
unto
the
soldiers
Matthew
saying
Say
His
disciples
came
night
and
stole
him
away
while
slept
Matthew
And
this
come
the
governor
ears
will
persuade
him
and
rid
you
care
Matthew
they
took
the
money
and
did
they
were
taught
and
this
saying
was
spread
abroad
among
the
Jews
and
continueth
until
this
day
Matthew
But
the
eleven
disciples
went
into
Galilee
unto
the
mountain
where
Jesus
had
appointed
them
Matthew
And
when
they
saw
him
they
worshipped
him
but
some
doubted
Matthew
And
Jesus
came
them
and
spake
unto
them
saying
All
authority
hath
been
given
unto
heaven
and
earth
Matthew
therefore
and
make
disciples
all
the
nations
baptizing
them
into
the
name
the
Father
and
the
Son
and
the
Holy
Spirit
Matthew
teaching
them
observe
all
things
whatsoever
commanded
you
and
with
you
always
even
unto
the
end
the
world
Mark
The
beginning
the
gospel
Jesus
Christ
the
Son
God
Mark
Even
written
Isaiah
the
prophet
Behold
send
messenger
before
thy
face
Who
shall
prepare
thy
way
Mark
The
voice
one
crying
the
wilderness
Make
ready
the
way
the
Lord
Make
his
paths
straight
Mark
John
came
who
baptized
the
wilderness
and
preached
the
baptism
repentance
unto
remission
sins
Mark
And
there
went
out
unto
him
all
the
country
Judæa
and
all
they
Jerusalem
and
they
were
baptized
him
the
river
Jordan
confessing
their
sins
Mark
And
John
was
clothed
with
camel
hair
and
had
leathern
girdle
about
his
loins
and
did
eat
locusts
and
wild
honey
Mark
And
preached
saying
There
cometh
after
that
mightier
than
the
latchet
whose
shoes
not
worthy
stoop
down
and
unloose
Mark
baptized
you
water
but
shall
baptize
you
the
Holy
Spirit
Mark
And
came
pass
those
days
that
Jesus
came
from
Nazareth
Galilee
and
was
baptized
John
the
Jordan
Mark
And
straightway
coming
out
the
water
saw
the
heavens
rent
asunder
and
the
Spirit
dove
descending
upon
him
Mark
and
voice
came
out
the
heavens
Thou
art
beloved
Son
thee
well
pleased
Mark
And
straightway
the
Spirit
driveth
him
forth
into
the
wilderness
Mark
And
was
the
wilderness
forty
days
tempted
Satan
and
was
with
the
wild
beasts
and
the
angels
ministered
unto
him
Mark
Now
after
John
was
delivered
Jesus
came
into
Galilee
preaching
the
gospel
God
Mark
and
saying
The
time
fulfilled
and
the
kingdom
God
hand
repent
and
believe
the
gospel
Mark
And
passing
along
the
sea
Galilee
saw
Simon
and
Andrew
the
brother
Simon
casting
net
the
sea
for
they
were
fishers
Mark
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
Come
after
and
will
make
you
become
fishers
men
Mark
And
straightway
they
left
the
nets
and
followed
him
Mark
And
going
little
further
saw
James
the
son
Zebedee
and
John
his
brother
who
also
were
the
boat
mending
the
nets
Mark
And
straightway
called
them
and
they
left
their
father
Zebedee
the
boat
with
the
hired
servants
and
went
after
him
Mark
And
they
into
Capernaum
and
straightway
the
sabbath
day
entered
into
the
synagogue
and
taught
Mark
And
they
were
astonished
his
teaching
for
taught
them
having
authority
and
not
the
scribes
Mark
And
straightway
there
was
their
synagogue
man
with
unclean
spirit
and
cried
out
Mark
saying
What
have
with
thee
Jesus
thou
Nazarene
art
thou
come
destroy
know
thee
who
thou
art
the
Holy
One
God
Mark
And
Jesus
rebuked
him
saying
Hold
thy
peace
and
come
out
him
Mark
And
the
unclean
spirit
tearing
him
and
crying
with
loud
voice
came
out
him
Mark
And
they
were
all
amazed
insomuch
that
they
questioned
among
themselves
saying
What
this
new
teaching
with
authority
commandeth
even
the
unclean
spirits
and
they
obey
him
Mark
And
the
report
him
went
out
straightway
everywhere
into
all
the
region
Galilee
round
about
Mark
And
straightway
when
they
were
come
out
the
synagogue
they
came
into
the
house
Simon
and
Andrew
with
James
and
John
Mark
Now
Simon
wife
mother
lay
sick
fever
and
straightway
they
tell
him
her
Mark
and
came
and
took
her
the
hand
and
raised
her
and
the
fever
left
her
and
she
ministered
unto
them
Mark
And
even
when
the
sun
did
set
they
brought
unto
him
all
that
were
sick
and
them
that
were
possessed
with
demons
Mark
And
all
the
city
was
gathered
together
the
door
Mark
And
healed
many
that
were
sick
with
divers
diseases
and
cast
out
many
demons
and
suffered
not
the
demons
speak
because
they
knew
him
Mark
And
the
morning
great
while
before
day
rose
and
went
out
and
departed
into
desert
place
and
there
prayed
Mark
And
Simon
and
they
that
were
with
him
followed
after
him
Mark
and
they
found
him
and
say
unto
him
All
are
seeking
thee
Mark
And
saith
unto
them
Let
elsewhere
into
the
next
towns
that
may
preach
there
also
for
this
end
came
forth
Mark
And
went
into
their
synagogues
throughout
all
Galilee
preaching
and
casting
out
demons
Mark
And
there
cometh
him
leper
beseeching
him
and
kneeling
down
him
and
saying
unto
him
thou
wilt
thou
canst
make
clean
Mark
And
being
moved
with
compassion
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
touched
him
and
saith
unto
him
will
thou
made
clean
Mark
And
straightway
the
leprosy
departed
from
him
and
was
made
clean
Mark
And
strictly
charged
him
and
straightway
sent
him
out
Mark
and
saith
unto
him
See
thou
say
nothing
any
man
but
show
thyself
the
priest
and
offer
for
thy
cleansing
the
things
which
Moses
commanded
for
testimony
unto
them
Mark
But
went
out
and
began
publish
much
and
spread
abroad
the
matter
insomuch
that
Jesus
could
more
openly
enter
into
city
but
was
without
desert
places
and
they
came
him
from
every
quarter
Mark
And
when
entered
again
into
Capernaum
after
some
days
was
noised
that
was
the
house
Mark
And
many
were
gathered
together
that
there
was
longer
room
for
them
not
even
about
the
door
and
spake
the
word
unto
them
Mark
And
they
come
bringing
unto
him
man
sick
the
palsy
borne
four
Mark
And
when
they
could
not
come
nigh
unto
him
for
the
crowd
they
uncovered
the
roof
where
was
and
when
they
had
broken
they
let
down
the
bed
whereon
the
sick
the
palsy
lay
Mark
And
Jesus
seeing
their
faith
saith
unto
the
sick
the
palsy
Son
thy
sins
are
forgiven
Mark
But
there
were
certain
the
scribes
sitting
there
and
reasoning
their
hearts
Mark
Why
doth
this
man
thus
speak
blasphemeth
who
can
forgive
sins
but
one
even
God
Mark
And
straightway
Jesus
perceiving
his
spirit
that
they
reasoned
within
themselves
saith
unto
them
Why
reason
these
things
your
hearts
Mark
Which
easier
say
the
sick
the
palsy
Thy
sins
are
forgiven
say
Arise
and
take
thy
bed
and
walk
Mark
But
that
may
know
that
the
Son
man
hath
authority
earth
forgive
sins
saith
the
sick
the
palsy
Mark
say
unto
thee
Arise
take
thy
bed
and
unto
thy
house
Mark
And
arose
and
straightway
took
the
bed
and
went
forth
before
them
all
insomuch
that
they
were
all
amazed
and
glorified
God
saying
never
saw
this
fashion
Mark
And
went
forth
again
the
sea
side
and
all
the
multitude
resorted
unto
him
and
taught
them
Mark
And
passed
saw
Levi
the
son
Alphæus
sitting
the
place
toll
and
saith
unto
him
Follow
And
arose
and
followed
him
Mark
And
came
pass
that
was
sitting
meat
his
house
and
many
publicans
and
sinners
sat
down
with
Jesus
and
his
disciples
for
there
were
many
and
they
followed
him
Mark
And
the
scribes
the
Pharisees
when
they
saw
that
was
eating
with
the
sinners
and
publicans
said
unto
his
disciples
How
that
eateth
and
drinketh
with
publicans
and
sinners
Mark
And
when
Jesus
heard
saith
unto
them
They
that
are
whole
have
need
physician
but
they
that
are
sick
came
not
call
the
righteous
but
sinners
Mark
And
John
disciples
and
the
Pharisees
were
fasting
and
they
come
and
say
unto
him
Why
John
disciples
and
the
disciples
the
Pharisees
fast
but
thy
disciples
fast
not
Mark
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
Can
the
sons
the
bridechamber
fast
while
the
bridegroom
with
them
long
they
have
the
bridegroom
with
them
they
cannot
fast
Mark
But
the
days
will
come
when
the
bridegroom
shall
taken
away
from
them
and
then
will
they
fast
that
day
Mark
man
seweth
piece
undressed
cloth
old
garment
else
that
which
should
fill
taketh
from
the
new
from
the
old
and
worse
rent
made
Mark
And
man
putteth
new
wine
into
old
wine
skins
else
the
wine
will
burst
the
skins
and
the
wine
perisheth
and
the
skins
but
they
put
new
wine
into
fresh
wine
skins
Mark
And
came
pass
that
was
going
the
sabbath
day
through
the
grainfields
and
his
disciples
began
they
went
pluck
the
ears
Mark
And
the
Pharisees
said
unto
him
Behold
why
they
the
sabbath
day
that
which
not
lawful
Mark
And
said
unto
them
Did
never
read
what
David
did
when
had
need
and
was
hungry
and
they
that
were
with
him
Mark
How
entered
into
the
house
God
when
Abiathar
was
high
priest
and
ate
the
showbread
which
not
lawful
eat
save
for
the
priests
and
gave
also
them
that
were
with
him
Mark
And
said
unto
them
The
sabbath
was
made
for
man
and
not
man
for
the
sabbath
Mark
that
the
Son
man
lord
even
the
sabbath
Mark
And
entered
again
into
the
synagogue
and
there
was
man
there
who
had
his
hand
withered
Mark
And
they
watched
him
whether
would
heal
him
the
sabbath
day
that
they
might
accuse
him
Mark
And
saith
unto
the
man
that
had
his
hand
withered
Stand
forth
Mark
And
saith
unto
them
lawful
the
sabbath
day
good
harm
save
life
kill
But
they
held
their
peace
Mark
And
when
had
looked
round
about
them
with
anger
being
grieved
the
hardening
their
heart
saith
unto
the
man
Stretch
forth
thy
hand
And
stretched
forth
and
his
hand
was
restored
Mark
And
the
Pharisees
went
out
and
straightway
with
the
Herodians
took
counsel
against
him
how
they
might
destroy
him
Mark
And
Jesus
with
his
disciples
withdrew
the
sea
and
great
multitude
from
Galilee
followed
and
from
Judæa
Mark
and
from
Jerusalem
and
from
Idumæa
and
beyond
the
Jordan
and
about
Tyre
and
Sidon
great
multitude
hearing
what
great
things
did
came
unto
him
Mark
And
spake
his
disciples
that
little
boat
should
wait
him
because
the
crowd
lest
they
should
throng
him
Mark
for
had
healed
many
insomuch
that
many
had
plagues
pressed
upon
him
that
they
might
touch
him
Mark
And
the
unclean
spirits
whensoever
they
beheld
him
fell
down
before
him
and
cried
saying
Thou
art
the
Son
God
Mark
And
charged
them
much
that
they
should
not
make
him
known
Mark
And
goeth
into
the
mountain
and
calleth
unto
him
whom
himself
would
and
they
went
unto
him
Mark
And
appointed
twelve
that
they
might
with
him
and
that
might
send
them
forth
preach
Mark
and
have
authority
cast
out
demons
Mark
and
Simon
surnamed
Peter
Mark
and
James
the
son
Zebedee
and
John
the
brother
James
and
them
surnamed
Boanerges
which
Sons
thunder
Mark
and
Andrew
and
Philip
and
Bartholomew
and
Matthew
and
Thomas
and
James
the
son
Alphæus
and
Thaddæus
and
Simon
the
Cananæan
Mark
and
Judas
Iscariot
who
also
betrayed
him
And
cometh
into
house
Mark
And
the
multitude
cometh
together
again
that
they
could
not
much
eat
bread
Mark
And
when
his
friends
heard
they
went
out
lay
hold
him
for
they
said
beside
himself
Mark
And
the
scribes
that
came
down
from
Jerusalem
said
hath
Beelzebub
and
the
prince
the
demons
casteth
out
the
demons
Mark
And
called
them
unto
him
and
said
unto
them
parables
How
can
Satan
cast
out
Satan
Mark
And
kingdom
divided
against
itself
that
kingdom
cannot
stand
Mark
And
house
divided
against
itself
that
house
will
not
able
stand
Mark
And
Satan
hath
risen
against
himself
and
divided
cannot
stand
but
hath
end
Mark
But
one
can
enter
into
the
house
the
strong
man
and
spoil
his
goods
except
first
bind
the
strong
man
and
then
will
spoil
his
house
Mark
Verily
say
unto
you
All
their
sins
shall
forgiven
unto
the
sons
men
and
their
blasphemies
wherewith
soever
they
shall
blaspheme
Mark
but
whosoever
shall
blaspheme
against
the
Holy
Spirit
hath
never
forgiveness
but
guilty
eternal
sin
Mark
because
they
said
hath
unclean
spirit
Mark
And
there
come
his
mother
and
his
brethren
and
standing
without
they
sent
unto
him
calling
him
Mark
And
multitude
was
sitting
about
him
and
they
say
unto
him
Behold
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
without
seek
for
thee
Mark
And
answereth
them
and
saith
Who
mother
and
brethren
Mark
And
looking
round
them
that
sat
round
about
him
saith
Behold
mother
and
brethren
Mark
For
whosoever
shall
the
will
God
the
same
brother
and
sister
and
mother
Mark
And
again
began
teach
the
sea
side
And
there
gathered
unto
him
very
great
multitude
that
entered
into
boat
and
sat
the
sea
and
all
the
multitude
were
the
sea
the
land
Mark
And
taught
them
many
things
parables
and
said
unto
them
his
teaching
Mark
Hearken
Behold
the
sower
went
forth
sow
Mark
and
came
pass
sowed
some
seed
fell
the
way
side
and
the
birds
came
and
devoured
Mark
And
other
fell
the
rocky
ground
where
had
not
much
earth
and
straightway
sprang
because
had
deepness
earth
Mark
and
when
the
sun
was
risen
was
scorched
and
because
had
root
withered
away
Mark
And
other
fell
among
the
thorns
and
the
thorns
grew
and
choked
and
yielded
fruit
Mark
And
others
fell
into
the
good
ground
and
yielded
fruit
growing
and
increasing
and
brought
forth
thirtyfold
and
sixtyfold
and
hundredfold
Mark
And
said
Who
hath
ears
hear
let
him
hear
Mark
And
when
was
alone
they
that
were
about
him
with
the
twelve
asked
him
the
parables
Mark
And
said
unto
them
Unto
you
given
the
mystery
the
kingdom
God
but
unto
them
that
are
without
all
things
are
done
parables
Mark
that
seeing
they
may
see
and
not
perceive
and
hearing
they
may
hear
and
not
understand
lest
haply
they
should
turn
again
and
should
forgiven
them
Mark
And
saith
unto
them
Know
not
this
parable
and
how
shall
know
all
the
parables
Mark
The
sower
soweth
the
word
Mark
And
these
are
they
the
way
side
where
the
word
sown
and
when
they
have
heard
straightway
cometh
Satan
and
taketh
away
the
word
which
hath
been
sown
them
Mark
And
these
like
manner
are
they
that
are
sown
upon
the
rocky
places
who
when
they
have
heard
the
word
straightway
receive
with
joy
Mark
and
they
have
root
themselves
but
endure
for
while
then
when
tribulation
persecution
ariseth
because
the
word
straightway
they
stumble
Mark
And
others
are
they
that
are
sown
among
the
thorns
these
are
they
that
have
heard
the
word
Mark
and
the
cares
the
world
and
the
deceitfulness
riches
and
the
lusts
other
things
entering
choke
the
word
and
becometh
unfruitful
Mark
And
those
are
they
that
were
sown
upon
the
good
ground
such
hear
the
word
and
accept
and
bear
fruit
thirtyfold
and
sixtyfold
and
hundredfold
Mark
And
said
unto
them
the
lamp
brought
put
under
the
bushel
under
the
bed
and
not
put
the
stand
Mark
For
there
nothing
hid
save
that
should
manifested
neither
was
anything
made
secret
but
that
should
come
light
Mark
any
man
hath
ears
hear
let
him
hear
Mark
And
said
unto
them
Take
heed
what
hear
with
what
measure
mete
shall
measured
unto
you
and
more
shall
given
unto
you
Mark
For
that
hath
him
shall
given
and
that
hath
not
from
him
shall
taken
away
even
that
which
hath
Mark
And
said
the
kingdom
God
man
should
cast
seed
upon
the
earth
Mark
and
should
sleep
and
rise
night
and
day
and
the
seed
should
spring
and
grow
knoweth
not
how
Mark
The
earth
beareth
fruit
herself
first
the
blade
then
the
ear
then
the
full
grain
the
ear
Mark
But
when
the
fruit
ripe
straightway
putteth
forth
the
sickle
because
the
harvest
come
Mark
And
said
How
shall
liken
the
kingdom
God
what
parable
shall
set
forth
Mark
like
grain
mustard
seed
which
when
sown
upon
the
earth
though
less
than
all
the
seeds
that
are
upon
the
earth
Mark
yet
when
sown
groweth
and
becometh
greater
than
all
the
herbs
and
putteth
out
great
branches
that
the
birds
the
heaven
can
lodge
under
the
shadow
thereof
Mark
And
with
many
such
parables
spake
the
word
unto
them
they
were
able
hear
Mark
and
without
parable
spake
not
unto
them
but
privately
his
own
disciples
expounded
all
things
Mark
And
that
day
when
even
was
come
saith
unto
them
Let
over
unto
the
other
side
Mark
And
leaving
the
multitude
they
take
him
with
them
even
was
the
boat
And
other
boats
were
with
him
Mark
And
there
ariseth
great
storm
wind
and
the
waves
beat
into
the
boat
insomuch
that
the
boat
was
now
filling
Mark
And
himself
was
the
stern
asleep
the
cushion
and
they
awake
him
and
say
unto
him
Teacher
carest
thou
not
that
perish
Mark
And
awoke
and
rebuked
the
wind
and
said
unto
the
sea
Peace
still
And
the
wind
ceased
and
there
was
great
calm
Mark
And
said
unto
them
Why
are
fearful
have
not
yet
faith
Mark
And
they
feared
exceedingly
and
said
one
another
Who
then
this
that
even
the
wind
and
the
sea
obey
him
Mark
And
they
came
the
other
side
the
sea
into
the
country
the
Gerasenes
Mark
And
when
was
come
out
the
boat
straightway
there
met
him
out
the
tombs
man
with
unclean
spirit
Mark
who
had
his
dwelling
the
tombs
and
man
could
any
more
bind
him
not
with
chain
Mark
because
that
had
been
often
bound
with
fetters
and
chains
and
the
chains
had
been
rent
asunder
him
and
the
fetters
broken
pieces
and
man
had
strength
tame
him
Mark
And
always
night
and
day
the
tombs
and
the
mountains
was
crying
out
and
cutting
himself
with
stones
Mark
And
when
saw
Jesus
from
afar
ran
and
worshipped
him
Mark
and
crying
out
with
loud
voice
saith
What
have
with
thee
Jesus
thou
Son
the
Most
High
God
adjure
thee
God
torment
not
Mark
For
said
unto
him
Come
forth
thou
unclean
spirit
out
the
man
Mark
And
asked
him
What
thy
name
And
saith
unto
him
name
Legion
for
are
many
Mark
And
besought
him
much
that
would
not
send
them
away
out
the
country
Mark
Now
there
was
there
the
mountain
side
great
herd
swine
feeding
Mark
And
they
besought
him
saying
Send
into
the
swine
that
may
enter
into
them
Mark
And
gave
them
leave
And
the
unclean
spirits
came
out
and
entered
into
the
swine
and
the
herd
rushed
down
the
steep
into
the
sea
number
about
two
thousand
and
they
were
drowned
the
sea
Mark
And
they
that
fed
them
fled
and
told
the
city
and
the
country
And
they
came
see
what
was
that
had
come
pass
Mark
And
they
come
Jesus
and
behold
him
that
was
possessed
with
demons
sitting
clothed
and
his
right
mind
even
him
that
had
the
legion
and
they
were
afraid
Mark
And
they
that
saw
declared
unto
them
how
befell
him
that
was
possessed
with
demons
and
concerning
the
swine
Mark
And
they
began
beseech
him
depart
from
their
borders
Mark
And
was
entering
into
the
boat
that
had
been
possessed
with
demons
besought
him
that
might
with
him
Mark
And
suffered
him
not
but
saith
unto
him
thy
house
unto
thy
friends
and
tell
them
how
great
things
the
Lord
hath
done
for
thee
and
how
had
mercy
thee
Mark
And
went
his
way
and
began
publish
Decapolis
how
great
things
Jesus
had
done
for
him
and
all
men
marvelled
Mark
And
when
Jesus
had
crossed
over
again
the
boat
unto
the
other
side
great
multitude
was
gathered
unto
him
and
was
the
sea
Mark
And
there
cometh
one
the
rulers
the
synagogue
Jairus
name
and
seeing
him
falleth
his
feet
Mark
and
beseecheth
him
much
saying
little
daughter
the
point
death
pray
thee
that
thou
come
and
lay
thy
hands
her
that
she
may
made
whole
and
live
Mark
And
went
with
him
and
great
multitude
followed
him
and
they
thronged
him
Mark
And
woman
who
had
issue
blood
twelve
years
Mark
and
had
suffered
many
things
many
physicians
and
had
spent
all
that
she
had
and
was
nothing
bettered
but
rather
grew
worse
Mark
having
heard
the
things
concerning
Jesus
came
the
crowd
behind
and
touched
his
garment
Mark
For
she
said
touch
but
his
garments
shall
made
whole
Mark
And
straightway
the
fountain
her
blood
was
dried
and
she
felt
her
body
that
she
was
healed
her
plague
Mark
And
straightway
Jesus
perceiving
himself
that
the
power
proceeding
from
him
had
gone
forth
turned
him
about
the
crowd
and
said
Who
touched
garments
Mark
And
his
disciples
said
unto
him
Thou
seest
the
multitude
thronging
thee
and
sayest
thou
Who
touched
Mark
And
looked
round
about
see
her
that
had
done
this
thing
Mark
But
the
woman
fearing
and
trembling
knowing
what
had
been
done
her
came
and
fell
down
before
him
and
told
him
all
the
truth
Mark
And
said
unto
her
Daughter
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole
peace
and
whole
thy
plague
Mark
While
yet
spake
they
come
from
the
ruler
the
synagogue
house
saying
Thy
daughter
dead
why
troublest
thou
the
Teacher
any
further
Mark
But
Jesus
not
heeding
the
word
spoken
saith
unto
the
ruler
the
synagogue
Fear
not
only
believe
Mark
And
suffered
man
follow
with
him
save
Peter
and
James
and
John
the
brother
James
Mark
And
they
come
the
house
the
ruler
the
synagogue
and
beholdeth
tumult
and
many
weeping
and
wailing
greatly
Mark
And
when
was
entered
saith
unto
them
Why
make
tumult
and
weep
the
child
not
dead
but
sleepeth
Mark
And
they
laughed
him
scorn
But
having
put
them
all
forth
taketh
the
father
the
child
and
her
mother
and
them
that
were
with
him
and
goeth
where
the
child
was
Mark
And
taking
the
child
the
hand
saith
unto
her
Talitha
cumi
which
being
interpreted
Damsel
say
unto
thee
Arise
Mark
And
straightway
the
damsel
rose
and
walked
for
she
was
twelve
years
old
And
they
were
amazed
straightway
with
great
amazement
Mark
And
charged
them
much
that
man
should
know
this
and
commanded
that
something
should
given
her
eat
Mark
And
went
out
from
thence
and
cometh
into
his
own
country
and
his
disciples
follow
him
Mark
And
when
the
sabbath
was
come
began
teach
the
synagogue
and
many
hearing
him
were
astonished
saying
Whence
hath
this
man
these
things
and
What
the
wisdom
that
given
unto
this
man
and
what
mean
such
mighty
works
wrought
his
hands
Mark
not
this
the
carpenter
the
son
Mary
and
brother
James
and
Joses
and
Judas
and
Simon
and
are
not
his
sisters
here
with
And
they
were
offended
him
Mark
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
prophet
not
without
honor
save
his
own
country
and
among
his
own
kin
and
his
own
house
Mark
And
could
there
mighty
work
save
that
laid
his
hands
upon
few
sick
folk
and
healed
them
Mark
And
marvelled
because
their
unbelief
And
went
round
about
the
villages
teaching
Mark
And
calleth
unto
him
the
twelve
and
began
send
them
forth
two
and
two
and
gave
them
authority
over
the
unclean
spirits
Mark
and
charged
them
that
they
should
take
nothing
for
their
journey
save
staff
only
bread
wallet
money
their
purse
Mark
but
shod
with
sandals
and
said
put
not
two
coats
Mark
And
said
unto
them
Wheresoever
enter
into
house
there
abide
till
depart
thence
Mark
And
whatsoever
place
shall
not
receive
you
and
they
hear
you
not
forth
thence
shake
off
the
dust
that
under
your
feet
for
testimony
unto
them
Mark
And
they
went
out
and
preached
that
men
should
repent
Mark
And
they
cast
out
many
demons
and
anointed
with
oil
many
that
were
sick
and
healed
them
Mark
And
king
Herod
heard
thereof
for
his
name
had
become
known
and
said
John
the
Baptizer
risen
from
the
dead
and
therefore
these
powers
work
him
Mark
But
others
said
Elijah
And
others
said
prophet
even
one
the
prophets
Mark
But
Herod
when
heard
thereof
said
John
whom
beheaded
risen
Mark
For
Herod
himself
had
sent
forth
and
laid
hold
upon
John
and
bound
him
prison
for
the
sake
Herodias
his
brother
Philip
wife
for
had
married
her
Mark
For
John
said
unto
Herod
not
lawful
for
thee
have
thy
brother
wife
Mark
And
Herodias
set
herself
against
him
and
desired
kill
him
and
she
could
not
Mark
for
Herod
feared
John
knowing
that
was
righteous
and
holy
man
and
kept
him
safe
And
when
heard
him
was
much
perplexed
and
heard
him
gladly
Mark
And
when
convenient
day
was
come
that
Herod
his
birthday
made
supper
his
lords
and
the
high
captains
and
the
chief
men
Galilee
Mark
and
when
the
daughter
Herodias
herself
came
and
danced
she
pleased
Herod
and
them
that
sat
meat
with
him
and
the
king
said
unto
the
damsel
Ask
whatsoever
thou
wilt
and
will
give
thee
Mark
And
sware
unto
her
Whatsoever
thou
shalt
ask
will
give
thee
unto
the
half
kingdom
Mark
And
she
went
out
and
said
unto
her
mother
What
shall
ask
And
she
said
The
head
John
the
Baptizer
Mark
And
she
came
straightway
with
haste
unto
the
king
and
asked
saying
will
that
thou
forthwith
give
platter
the
head
John
the
Baptist
Mark
And
the
king
was
exceeding
sorry
but
for
the
sake
his
oaths
and
them
that
sat
meat
would
not
reject
her
Mark
And
straightway
the
king
sent
forth
soldier
his
guard
and
commanded
bring
his
head
and
went
and
beheaded
him
the
prison
Mark
and
brought
his
head
platter
and
gave
the
damsel
and
the
damsel
gave
her
mother
Mark
And
when
his
disciples
heard
thereof
they
came
and
took
his
corpse
and
laid
tomb
Mark
And
the
apostles
gather
themselves
together
unto
Jesus
and
they
told
him
all
things
whatsoever
they
had
done
and
whatsoever
they
had
taught
Mark
And
saith
unto
them
Come
yourselves
apart
into
desert
place
and
rest
while
For
there
were
many
coming
and
going
and
they
had
leisure
much
eat
Mark
And
they
went
away
the
boat
desert
place
apart
Mark
And
the
people
saw
them
going
and
many
knew
them
and
they
ran
together
there
foot
from
all
the
cities
and
outwent
them
Mark
And
came
forth
and
saw
great
multitude
and
had
compassion
them
because
they
were
sheep
not
having
shepherd
and
began
teach
them
many
things
Mark
And
when
the
day
was
now
far
spent
his
disciples
came
unto
him
and
said
The
place
desert
and
the
day
now
far
spent
Mark
send
them
away
that
they
may
into
the
country
and
villages
round
about
and
buy
themselves
somewhat
eat
Mark
But
answered
and
said
unto
them
Give
them
eat
And
they
say
unto
him
Shall
and
buy
two
hundred
shillings
worth
bread
and
give
them
eat
Mark
And
saith
unto
them
How
many
loaves
have
and
see
And
when
they
knew
they
say
Five
and
two
fishes
Mark
And
commanded
them
that
all
should
sit
down
companies
upon
the
green
grass
Mark
And
they
sat
down
ranks
hundreds
and
fifties
Mark
And
took
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fishes
and
looking
heaven
blessed
and
brake
the
loaves
and
gave
the
disciples
set
before
them
and
the
two
fishes
divided
among
them
all
Mark
And
they
all
ate
and
were
filled
Mark
And
they
took
broken
pieces
twelve
basketfuls
and
also
the
fishes
Mark
And
they
that
ate
the
loaves
were
five
thousand
men
Mark
And
straightway
constrained
his
disciples
enter
into
the
boat
and
before
him
unto
the
other
side
Bethsaida
while
himself
sendeth
the
multitude
away
Mark
And
after
had
taken
leave
them
departed
into
the
mountain
pray
Mark
And
when
even
was
come
the
boat
was
the
midst
the
sea
and
alone
the
land
Mark
And
seeing
them
distressed
rowing
for
the
wind
was
contrary
unto
them
about
the
fourth
watch
the
night
cometh
unto
them
walking
the
sea
and
would
have
passed
them
Mark
but
they
when
they
saw
him
walking
the
sea
supposed
that
was
ghost
and
cried
out
Mark
for
they
all
saw
him
and
were
troubled
But
straightway
spake
with
them
and
saith
unto
them
good
cheer
not
afraid
Mark
And
went
unto
them
into
the
boat
and
the
wind
ceased
and
they
were
sore
amazed
themselves
Mark
for
they
understood
not
concerning
the
loaves
but
their
heart
was
hardened
Mark
And
when
they
had
crossed
over
they
came
the
land
unto
Gennesaret
and
moored
the
shore
Mark
And
when
they
were
come
out
the
boat
straightway
the
people
knew
him
Mark
and
ran
round
about
that
whole
region
and
began
carry
about
their
beds
those
that
were
sick
where
they
heard
was
Mark
And
wheresoever
entered
into
villages
into
cities
into
the
country
they
laid
the
sick
the
marketplaces
and
besought
him
that
they
might
touch
were
but
the
border
his
garment
and
many
touched
him
were
made
whole
Mark
And
there
are
gathered
together
unto
him
the
Pharisees
and
certain
the
scribes
who
had
come
from
Jerusalem
Mark
and
had
seen
that
some
his
disciples
ate
their
bread
with
defiled
that
unwashen
hands
Mark
For
the
Pharisees
and
all
the
Jews
except
they
wash
their
hands
diligently
eat
not
holding
the
tradition
the
elders
Mark
and
when
they
come
from
the
marketplace
except
they
bathe
themselves
they
eat
not
and
many
other
things
there
are
which
they
have
received
hold
washings
cups
and
pots
and
brasen
vessels
Mark
And
the
Pharisees
and
the
scribes
ask
him
Why
walk
not
thy
disciples
according
the
tradition
the
elders
but
eat
their
bread
with
defiled
hands
Mark
And
said
unto
them
Well
did
Isaiah
prophesy
you
hypocrites
written
This
people
honoreth
with
their
lips
But
their
heart
far
from
Mark
But
vain
they
worship
Teaching
their
doctrines
the
precepts
men
Mark
leave
the
commandment
God
and
hold
fast
the
tradition
men
Mark
And
said
unto
them
Full
well
reject
the
commandment
God
that
may
keep
your
tradition
Mark
For
Moses
said
Honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
that
speaketh
evil
father
mother
let
him
die
the
death
Mark
but
say
man
shall
say
his
father
his
mother
That
wherewith
thou
mightest
have
been
profited
Corban
that
say
Given
God
Mark
longer
suffer
him
aught
for
his
father
his
mother
Mark
making
void
the
word
God
your
tradition
which
have
delivered
and
many
such
like
things
Mark
And
called
him
the
multitude
again
and
said
unto
them
Hear
all
you
and
understand
Mark
there
nothing
from
without
the
man
that
going
into
him
can
defile
him
but
the
things
which
proceed
out
the
man
are
those
that
defile
the
man
Mark
Mark
And
when
was
entered
into
the
house
from
the
multitude
his
disciples
asked
him
the
parable
Mark
And
saith
unto
them
Are
without
understanding
also
Perceive
not
that
whatsoever
from
without
goeth
into
the
man
cannot
defile
him
Mark
because
goeth
not
into
his
heart
but
into
his
belly
and
goeth
out
into
the
draught
This
said
making
all
meats
clean
Mark
And
said
That
which
proceedeth
out
the
man
that
defileth
the
man
Mark
For
from
within
out
the
heart
men
evil
thoughts
proceed
fornications
thefts
murders
adulteries
Mark
covetings
wickednesses
deceit
lasciviousness
evil
eye
railing
pride
foolishness
Mark
all
these
evil
things
proceed
from
within
and
defile
the
man
Mark
And
from
thence
arose
and
went
away
into
the
borders
Tyre
and
Sidon
And
entered
into
house
and
would
have
man
know
and
could
not
hid
Mark
But
straightway
woman
whose
little
daughter
had
unclean
spirit
having
heard
him
came
and
fell
down
his
feet
Mark
Now
the
woman
was
Greek
Syrophoenician
race
And
she
besought
him
that
would
cast
forth
the
demon
out
her
daughter
Mark
And
said
unto
her
Let
the
children
first
filled
for
not
meet
take
the
children
bread
and
cast
the
dogs
Mark
But
she
answered
and
saith
unto
him
Yea
Lord
even
the
dogs
under
the
table
eat
the
children
crumbs
Mark
And
said
unto
her
For
this
saying
thy
way
the
demon
gone
out
thy
daughter
Mark
And
she
went
away
unto
her
house
and
found
the
child
laid
upon
the
bed
and
the
demon
gone
out
Mark
And
again
went
out
from
the
borders
Tyre
and
came
through
Sidon
unto
the
sea
Galilee
through
the
midst
the
borders
Decapolis
Mark
And
they
bring
unto
him
one
that
was
deaf
and
had
impediment
his
speech
and
they
beseech
him
lay
his
hand
upon
him
Mark
And
took
him
aside
from
the
multitude
privately
and
put
his
fingers
into
his
ears
and
spat
and
touched
his
tongue
Mark
and
looking
heaven
sighed
and
saith
unto
him
Ephphatha
that
opened
Mark
And
his
ears
were
opened
and
the
bond
his
tongue
was
loosed
and
spake
plain
Mark
And
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
man
but
the
more
charged
them
much
the
more
great
deal
they
published
Mark
And
they
were
beyond
measure
astonished
saying
hath
done
all
things
well
maketh
even
the
deaf
hear
and
the
dumb
speak
Mark
those
days
when
there
was
again
great
multitude
and
they
had
nothing
eat
called
unto
him
his
disciples
and
saith
unto
them
Mark
have
compassion
the
multitude
because
they
continue
with
now
three
days
and
have
nothing
eat
Mark
and
send
them
away
fasting
their
home
they
will
faint
the
way
and
some
them
are
come
from
far
Mark
And
his
disciples
answered
him
Whence
shall
one
able
fill
these
men
with
bread
here
desert
place
Mark
And
asked
them
How
many
loaves
have
And
they
said
Seven
Mark
And
commandeth
the
multitude
sit
down
the
ground
and
took
the
seven
loaves
and
having
given
thanks
brake
and
gave
his
disciples
set
before
them
and
they
set
them
before
the
multitude
Mark
And
they
had
few
small
fishes
and
having
blessed
them
commanded
set
these
also
before
them
Mark
And
they
ate
and
were
filled
and
they
took
broken
pieces
that
remained
over
seven
baskets
Mark
And
they
were
about
four
thousand
and
sent
them
away
Mark
And
straightway
entered
into
the
boat
with
his
disciples
and
came
into
the
parts
Dalmanutha
Mark
And
the
Pharisees
came
forth
and
began
question
with
him
seeking
him
sign
from
heaven
trying
him
Mark
And
sighed
deeply
his
spirit
and
saith
Why
doth
this
generation
seek
sign
verily
say
unto
you
There
shall
sign
given
unto
this
generation
Mark
And
left
them
and
again
entering
into
the
boat
departed
the
other
side
Mark
And
they
forgot
take
bread
and
they
had
not
the
boat
with
them
more
than
one
loaf
Mark
And
charged
them
saying
Take
heed
beware
the
leaven
the
Pharisees
and
the
leaven
Herod
Mark
And
they
reasoned
one
with
another
saying
have
bread
Mark
And
Jesus
perceiving
saith
unto
them
Why
reason
because
have
bread
not
yet
perceive
neither
understand
have
your
heart
hardened
Mark
Having
eyes
see
not
and
having
ears
hear
not
and
not
remember
Mark
When
brake
the
five
loaves
among
the
five
thousand
how
many
baskets
full
broken
pieces
took
They
say
unto
him
Twelve
Mark
And
when
the
seven
among
the
four
thousand
how
many
basketfuls
broken
pieces
took
And
they
say
unto
him
Seven
Mark
And
said
unto
them
not
yet
understand
Mark
And
they
come
unto
Bethsaida
And
they
bring
him
blind
man
and
beseech
him
touch
him
Mark
And
took
hold
the
blind
man
the
hand
and
brought
him
out
the
village
and
when
had
spit
his
eyes
and
laid
his
hands
upon
him
asked
him
Seest
thou
aught
Mark
And
looked
and
said
see
men
for
behold
them
trees
walking
Mark
Then
again
laid
his
hands
upon
his
eyes
and
looked
stedfastly
and
was
restored
and
saw
all
things
clearly
Mark
And
sent
him
away
his
home
saying
not
even
enter
into
the
village
Mark
And
Jesus
went
forth
and
his
disciples
into
the
villages
Cæsarea
Philippi
and
the
way
asked
his
disciples
saying
unto
them
Who
men
say
that
Mark
And
they
told
him
saying
John
the
Baptist
and
others
Elijah
but
others
One
the
prophets
Mark
And
asked
them
But
who
say
that
Peter
answereth
and
saith
unto
him
Thou
art
the
Christ
Mark
And
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
man
him
Mark
And
began
teach
them
that
the
Son
man
must
suffer
many
things
and
rejected
the
elders
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
killed
and
after
three
days
rise
again
Mark
And
spake
the
saying
openly
And
Peter
took
him
and
began
rebuke
him
Mark
But
turning
about
and
seeing
his
disciples
rebuked
Peter
and
saith
Get
thee
behind
Satan
for
thou
mindest
not
the
things
God
but
the
things
men
Mark
And
called
unto
him
the
multitude
with
his
disciples
and
said
unto
them
any
man
would
come
after
let
him
deny
himself
and
take
his
cross
and
follow
Mark
For
whosoever
would
save
his
life
shall
lose
and
whosoever
shall
lose
his
life
for
sake
and
the
gospel
shall
save
Mark
For
what
doth
profit
man
gain
the
whole
world
and
forfeit
his
life
Mark
For
what
should
man
give
exchange
for
his
life
Mark
For
whosoever
shall
ashamed
and
words
this
adulterous
and
sinful
generation
the
Son
man
also
shall
ashamed
him
when
cometh
the
glory
his
Father
with
the
holy
angels
Mark
And
said
unto
them
Verily
say
unto
you
There
are
some
here
them
that
stand
who
shall
wise
taste
death
till
they
see
the
kingdom
God
come
with
power
Mark
And
after
six
days
Jesus
taketh
with
him
Peter
and
James
and
John
and
bringeth
them
into
high
mountain
apart
themselves
and
was
transfigured
before
them
Mark
and
his
garments
became
glistering
exceeding
white
fuller
earth
can
whiten
them
Mark
And
there
appeared
unto
them
Elijah
with
Moses
and
they
were
talking
with
Jesus
Mark
And
Peter
answereth
and
saith
Jesus
Rabbi
good
for
here
and
let
make
three
tabernacles
one
for
thee
and
one
for
Moses
and
one
for
Elijah
Mark
For
knew
not
what
answer
for
they
became
sore
afraid
Mark
And
there
came
cloud
overshadowing
them
and
there
came
voice
out
the
cloud
This
beloved
Son
hear
him
Mark
And
suddenly
looking
round
about
they
saw
one
any
more
save
Jesus
only
with
themselves
Mark
And
they
were
coming
down
from
the
mountain
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
man
what
things
they
had
seen
save
when
the
Son
man
should
have
risen
again
from
the
dead
Mark
And
they
kept
the
saying
questioning
among
themselves
what
the
rising
again
from
the
dead
should
mean
Mark
And
they
asked
him
saying
How
that
the
scribes
say
that
Elijah
must
first
come
Mark
And
said
unto
them
Elijah
indeed
cometh
first
and
restoreth
all
things
and
how
written
the
Son
man
that
should
suffer
many
things
and
set
nought
Mark
But
say
unto
you
that
Elijah
come
and
they
have
also
done
unto
him
whatsoever
they
would
even
written
him
Mark
And
when
they
came
the
disciples
they
saw
great
multitude
about
them
and
scribes
questioning
with
them
Mark
And
straightway
all
the
multitude
when
they
saw
him
were
greatly
amazed
and
running
him
saluted
him
Mark
And
asked
them
What
question
with
them
Mark
And
one
the
multitude
answered
him
Teacher
brought
unto
thee
son
who
hath
dumb
spirit
Mark
and
wheresoever
taketh
him
dasheth
him
down
and
foameth
and
grindeth
his
teeth
and
pineth
away
and
spake
thy
disciples
that
they
should
cast
out
and
they
were
not
able
Mark
And
answereth
them
and
saith
faithless
generation
how
long
shall
with
you
how
long
shall
bear
with
you
bring
him
unto
Mark
And
they
brought
him
unto
him
and
when
saw
him
straightway
the
spirit
tare
him
grievously
and
fell
the
ground
and
wallowed
foaming
Mark
And
asked
his
father
How
long
time
since
this
hath
come
unto
him
And
said
From
child
Mark
And
oft
times
hath
cast
him
both
into
the
fire
and
into
the
waters
destroy
him
but
thou
canst
anything
have
compassion
and
help
Mark
And
Jesus
said
unto
him
thou
canst
All
things
are
possible
him
that
believeth
Mark
Straightway
the
father
the
child
cried
out
and
said
believe
help
thou
mine
unbelief
Mark
And
when
Jesus
saw
that
multitude
came
running
together
rebuked
the
unclean
spirit
saying
unto
him
Thou
dumb
and
deaf
spirit
command
thee
come
out
him
and
enter
more
into
him
Mark
And
having
cried
out
and
torn
him
much
came
out
and
the
boy
became
one
dead
insomuch
that
the
more
part
said
dead
Mark
But
Jesus
took
him
the
hand
and
raised
him
and
arose
Mark
And
when
was
come
into
the
house
his
disciples
asked
him
privately
How
that
could
not
cast
out
Mark
And
said
unto
them
This
kind
can
come
out
nothing
save
prayer
Mark
And
they
went
forth
from
thence
and
passed
through
Galilee
and
would
not
that
any
man
should
know
Mark
For
taught
his
disciples
and
said
unto
them
The
Son
man
delivered
into
the
hands
men
and
they
shall
kill
him
and
when
killed
after
three
days
shall
rise
again
Mark
But
they
understood
not
the
saying
and
were
afraid
ask
him
Mark
And
they
came
Capernaum
and
when
was
the
house
asked
them
What
were
reasoning
the
way
Mark
But
they
held
their
peace
for
they
had
disputed
one
with
another
the
way
who
was
the
greatest
Mark
And
sat
down
and
called
the
twelve
and
saith
unto
them
any
man
would
first
shall
last
all
and
servant
all
Mark
And
took
little
child
and
set
him
the
midst
them
and
taking
him
his
arms
said
unto
them
Mark
Whosoever
shall
receive
one
such
little

And

and
multitudes
come
together
unto

and
said
unto
them
What
did
Moses
command
you
Mark
And
they
said
Moses
suffered
write
bill
divorcement
and
put
her
away
Mark
But
Jesus
said
unto
them
For
your
hardness
heart
wrote
you
this
commandment
Mark
But
from
the
beginning
the
creation
Male
and
female
made
them
Mark
For
this
cause
shall
man
leave
his
father
and
mother
and
shall
cleave
his
wife
Mark
and
the
two
shall
become
one
flesh
that
they
are
more
two
but
one
flesh
Mark
What
therefore
God
hath
joined
together
let
not
man
put
asunder
Mark
And
the
house
the
disciples
asked
him
again
this
matter
Mark
And
saith
unto
them
Whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
and
marry
another
committeth
adultery
against
her
Mark
and
she
herself
shall
put
away
her
husband
and
marry
another
she
committeth
adultery
Mark
And
they
were
bringing
unto
him
little
children
that
should
touch
them
and
the
disciples
rebuked
them
Mark
But
when
Jesus
saw
was
moved
with
indignation
and
said
unto
them
Suffer
the
little
children
come
unto
forbid
them
not
for
such
belongeth
the
kingdom
God
Mark
Verily
say
unto
you
Whosoever

Mark
And
took
them
his
arms
and
blessed
them
laying
his
hands
upon
them
Mark
And
was
going
forth
into
the
way
there
ran
one
him
and
kneeled
him
and
asked
him
Good
Teacher
what
shall
that
may
inherit
eternal
life
Mark
And
Jesus
said
unto
him
Why
callest
thou
good
none
good
save
one
even
God
Mark
Thou
knowest
the
commandments
not
kill
not
commit
adultery
not
steal
not
bear
false
witness
not
defraud
Honor
thy
father
and
mother
Mark
And
said
unto
him
Teacher
all
these
things
have
observed
from
youth
Mark
And
Jesus
looking
upon
him
loved
him
and
said
unto
him
One
thing
thou
lackest
sell
whatsoever
thou
hast
and
give
the
poor
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
heaven
and
come
follow
Mark
But
his
countenance
fell
the
saying
and
went
away
sorrowful
for
was
one
that
had
great
possessions
Mark
And
Jesus
looked
round
about
and
saith
unto
his
disciples
How
hardly
shall
they
that
have
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
God
Mark
And
the
disciples
were
amazed
his
words
But
Jesus
answereth
again
and
saith
unto
them
Children
how
hard
for
them
that
trust
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
God
Mark
easier
for
camel
through
needle
eye
than
for
rich
man
enter
into
the
kingdom
God
Mark
And
they
were
astonished
exceedingly
saying
unto
him
Then
who
can
saved
Mark
Jesus
looking
upon
them
saith
With
men
impossible
but
not
with
God
for
all
things
are
possible
with
God
Mark
Peter
began
say
unto
him
have
left
all
and
have
followed
thee
Mark
Jesus
said
Verily
say
unto
you
There
man
that
hath
left
house
brethren
sisters
mother
father
children
lands
for
sake
and
for
the
gospel
sake
Mark
but
shall
receive
hundredfold
now
this
time
houses
and
brethren
and
sisters
and
mothers
and
children
and
lands
with
persecutions
and
the
world
come
eternal
life
Mark
But
many
that
are
first
shall
last
and
the
last
first
Mark
And
they
were
the
way
going
Jerusalem
and
Jesus
was
going
before
them
and
they
were
amazed
and
they
that
followed
were
afraid
And
took
again
the
twelve
and
began
tell
them
the
things
that
were
happen
unto
him
Mark
saying
Behold
Jerusalem
and
the
Son
man
shall
delivered
unto
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
they
shall
condemn
him
death
and
shall
deliver
him
unto
the
Gentiles
Mark
and
they
shall
mock
him
and
shall
spit
upon
him
and
shall
scourge
him
and
shall
kill
him
and
after
three
days
shall
rise
again
Mark
And
there
come
near
unto
him
James
and
John
the
sons
Zebedee
saying
unto
him
Teacher
would
that
thou
shouldest
for
whatsoever
shall
ask
thee
Mark
And
said
unto
them
What
would
that
should
for
you
Mark
And
they
said
unto
him
Grant
unto
that
may
sit
one
thy
right
hand
and
one
thy
left
hand
thy
glory
Mark
But
Jesus
said
unto
them
know
not
what
ask
Are
able
drink
the
cup
that
drink
baptized
with
the
baptism
that
baptized
with
Mark
And
they
said
unto
him
are
able
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
The
cup
that
drink
shall
drink
and
with
the
baptism
that
baptized
withal
shall
baptized
Mark
but
sit
right
hand
left
hand
not
mine
give
but
for
them
for
whom
hath
been
prepared
Mark
And
when
the
ten
heard
they
began
moved
with
indignation
concerning
James
and
John
Mark
And
Jesus
called
them
him
and
saith
unto
them
know
that
they
who
are
accounted
rule
over
the
Gentiles
lord
over
them
and
their
great
ones
exercise
authority
over
them
Mark
But
not
among
you
but
whosoever
would
become
great
among
you
shall
your
minister
Mark
and
whosoever
would
first
among
you
shall
servant
all
Mark
For
the
Son
man
also
came
not
ministered
unto
but
minister
and
give
his
life
ransom
for
many
Mark
And
they
come
Jericho
and
went
out
from
Jericho
with
his
disciples
and

And
when
heard
that

Jesus
the
Nazarene
began
cry
out
and
say
Jesus
thou
son
David
have
mercy
Mark
And
many
rebuked
him
that
should
hold
his
peace
but
cried
out
the
more
great
deal
Thou
son
David
have
mercy
Mark
And
Jesus
stood
still
and
said
Call
him
And
they
call
the
blind
man
saying
unto
him
good
cheer
rise
calleth
thee
Mark
And
casting
away
his
garment
sprang
and
came
Jesus
Mark
And
Jesus
answered
him
and
said
What
wilt
thou
that
should
unto
thee
And
the
blind
man
said
unto
him
Rabboni
that
may
receive
sight
Mark
And
Jesus
said
unto
him
thy
way
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole
And
straightway
received
his
sight
and
followed
him
the
way
Mark
And
when
they
draw
nigh
unto
Jerusalem
unto
Bethphage
and
Bethany
the
mount
Olives
sendeth

and
saith
unto
them

And

unto
you
Why

say
The
Lord
hath
need
him
and
straightway
will
send
him
back
hither
Mark
And
they
went
away
and
found
colt
tied

door
without
the
open
street
and
they
loose
him
Mark
And
certain
them
that
stood
there
said
unto
them
What
loosing

colt
Mark
And
they
said
unto
them
even
Jesus
had
said
and
they
let
them
Mark
And
they
bring
the
colt
unto
Jesus
and
cast
him
their
garments
and
sat
upon
him
Mark
And
many
spread
their
garments
upon
the
way
and
others
branches
which
they
had
cut
from
the
fields
Mark
And
they
that
went
before
and
they
that
followed
cried
Hosanna
Blessed

name
the
Lord
Mark
Blessed

father
David
Hosanna

And

into
Jerusalem
into
the
temple
and
when

looked
round
about

all
things
being
now
eventide
went
out
unto

And
the

And

Mark
And
answered
and
said
unto
man

fruit
from
thee
henceforward
for
ever
And
his
disciples
heard
Mark
And
they
come
Jerusalem
and
entered
into
the
temple
and
began
cast
out
them
that
sold
and
them
that
bought
the
temple
and
overthrew
the
tables
the
money
changers
and
the
seats
them
that
sold
the
doves
Mark
and
would
not
suffer
that
any
man
should
carry

through
the
temple
Mark
And

and
said
unto
them

for
all
the
nations
but

Mark
And
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
heard
and
sought
how
they
might
destroy
him
for
they
feared
him
for
all
the
multitude
was
astonished
his
teaching
Mark
And
every
evening
went
forth
out
the
city
Mark
And
they
passed
the
morning
they
saw
the
fig
tree
withered
away
from
the
roots
Mark
And
Peter
calling
remembrance
saith
unto
him
Rabbi
behold
the
fig
tree
which
thou
cursedst
withered
away
Mark
And
Jesus
answering
saith
unto
them
Have
faith

Mark
Verily
say
unto
you
Whosoever
shall
say
unto
this
mountain

and
cast
into
the
sea
and
shall
not
doubt
his
heart
but
shall
believe
that
what
saith

have
Mark
Therefore
say
unto
you
All
things
whatsoever

and
ask
for

have
them
Mark
And
whensoever

forgive
you
your
trespasses
Mark
Mark
And
they
come
again
Jerusalem
and
was
walking
the
temple
there
come
him
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders
Mark
and
they
said
unto
him
what
authority
doest
thou
these
things
who
gave
thee
this
authority
these
things
Mark
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
will
ask
you
one
question
and
answer
and
will
tell
you
what
authority
these
things
Mark
The
baptism
John
was
from
heaven
from
men
answer
Mark
And
they
reasoned
with
themselves
saying
shall
say
From
heaven
will
say
Why
then
did
not
believe
him
Mark
But
should
say
From
men
they
feared
the
people
for
all
verily
held
John
prophet
Mark
And
they
answered
Jesus
and
say
know
not
And
Jesus
saith
unto
them
Neither
tell
you
what
authority
these
things
Mark
And
began
speak
unto
them
parables
man
planted
vineyard
and
set
hedge
about
and
digged
pit
for
the
winepress
and
built
tower
and
let
out
husbandmen
and
went
into
another
country
Mark
And
the
season
sent
the
husbandmen
servant
that
might
receive
from
the
husbandmen
the
fruits
the
vineyard
Mark
And
they
took
him
and
beat
him
and
sent
him
away
empty
Mark
And
again
sent
unto
them
another
servant
and
him
they
wounded
the
head
and
handled
shamefully
Mark
And
sent
another
and
him
they
killed
and
many
others
beating
some
and
killing
some
Mark
had
yet
one
beloved
son
sent
him
last
unto
them
saying
They
will
reverence
son
Mark
But
those
husbandmen
said
among
themselves
This
the
heir
come
let
kill
him
and
the
inheritance
shall
ours
Mark
And
they
took
him
and
killed
him
and
cast
him
forth
out
the
vineyard
Mark
What
therefore
will
the
lord
the
vineyard
will
come
and
destroy
the
husbandmen
and
will
give
the
vineyard
unto
others
Mark
Have
not
read
even
this
scripture
The
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
The
same
was
made
the
head
the
corner
Mark
This
was
from
the
Lord
And
marvellous
our
eyes
Mark
And
they
sought
lay
hold
him
and
they
feared
the
multitude
for
they
perceived
that
spake
the
parable
against
them
and
they
left
him
and
went
away
Mark
And
they
send
unto
him
certain
the
Pharisees
and
the
Herodians
that
they
might
catch
him
talk
Mark
And
when
they
were
come
they
say
unto
him
Teacher
know
that
thou
art
true
and
carest
not
for
any
one
for
thou
regardest
not
the
person
men
but
truth
teachest
the
way
God
lawful
give
tribute
unto
Cæsar
not
Mark
Shall
give
shall
not
give
But
knowing
their
hypocrisy
said
unto
them
Why
make
trial
bring
denarius
that
may
see
Mark
And
they
brought
And
saith
unto
them
Whose
this
image
and
superscription
And
they
said
unto
him
Cæsar
Mark
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
Render
unto
Cæsar
the
things
that
are
Cæsar
and
unto
God
the
things
that
are
God
And
they
marvelled
greatly
him
Mark
And
there
come
unto
him
Sadducees
who
say
that
there
resurrection
and
they
asked
him
saying
Mark
Teacher
Moses
wrote
unto
man
brother
die
and
leave
wife
behind
him
and
leave
child
that
his
brother
should
take
his
wife
and
raise
seed
unto
his
brother
Mark
There
were
seven
brethren
and
the
first
took
wife
and
dying
left
seed
Mark
and
the
second
took
her
and
died
leaving
seed
behind
him
and
the
third
likewise
Mark
and
the
seven
left
seed
Last
all
the
woman
also
died
Mark
the
resurrection
whose
wife
shall
she
them
for
the
seven
had
her
wife
Mark
Jesus
said
unto
them
not
for
this
cause
that
err
that
know
not
the
scriptures
nor
the
power
God
Mark
For
when
they
shall
rise
from
the
dead
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
marriage
but
are
angels
heaven
Mark
But
touching
the
dead
that
they
are
raised
have
not
read
the
book
Moses
the
place
concerning
the
Bush
how
God
spake
unto
him
saying
the
God
Abraham
and
the
God
Isaac
and
the
God
Jacob
Mark
not
the
God
the
dead
but
the
living
greatly
err
Mark
And
one
the
scribes
came
and
heard
them
questioning
together
and
knowing
that
had
answered
them
well
asked
him
What
commandment
the
first
all
Mark
Jesus
answered
The
first
Hear
Israel
The
Lord
our
God
the
Lord
one
Mark
and
thou
shalt
love
the
Lord
thy
God
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
mind
and
with
all
thy
strength
Mark
The
second
this
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
thyself
There
none
other
commandment
greater
than
these
Mark
And
the
scribe
said
unto
him
truth
Teacher
thou
hast
well
said
that
one
and
there
none
other
but
Mark
and
love
him
with
all
the
heart
and
with
all
the
understanding
and
with
all
the
strength
and
love
his
neighbor
himself
much
more
than
all
whole
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
Mark
And
when
Jesus
saw
that
answered
discreetly
said
unto
him
Thou
art
not
far
from
the
kingdom
God
And
man
after
that
durst
ask
him
any
question
Mark
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
taught
the
temple
How
say
the
scribes
that
the
Christ
the
son
David
Mark
David
himself
said
the
Holy
Spirit
The
Lord
said
unto
Lord
Sit
thou
right
hand
Till
make
thine
enemies
the
footstool
thy
feet
Mark
David
himself
calleth
him
Lord
and
whence
his
son
And
the
common
people
heard
him
gladly
Mark
And
his
teaching
said
Beware
the
scribes
who
desire
walk
long
robes
and
have
salutations
the
marketplaces
Mark
and
chief
seats
the
synagogues
and
chief
places
feasts
Mark
they
that
devour
widows
houses
and
for
pretence
make
long
prayers
these
shall
receive
greater
condemnation
Mark
And
sat
down
over
against
the
treasury
and
beheld
how
the
multitude
cast
money
into
the
treasury
and
many
that
were
rich
cast
much
Mark
And
there
came
poor
widow
and
she
cast
two
mites
which
make
farthing
Mark
And
called
unto
him
his
disciples
and
said
unto
them
Verily
say
unto
you
This
poor
widow
cast
more
than
all
they
that
are
casting
into
the
treasury
Mark
for
they
all
did
cast
their
superfluity
but
she
her
want
did
cast
all
that
she
had
even
all
her
living
Mark
And
went
forth
out
the
temple
one
his
disciples
saith
unto
him
Teacher
behold
what
manner
stones
and
what
manner
buildings
Mark
And
Jesus
said
unto
him
Seest
thou
these
great
buildings
there
shall
not
left
here
one
stone
upon
another
which
shall
not
thrown
down
Mark
And
sat
the
mount
Olives
over
against
the
temple
Peter
and
James
and
John
and
Andrew
asked
him
privately
Mark
Tell
when
shall
these
things
and
what
shall
the
sign
when
these
things
are
all
about
accomplished
Mark
And
Jesus
began
say
unto
them
Take
heed
that
man
lead
you
astray
Mark
Many
shall
come
name
saying
and
shall
lead
many
astray
Mark
And
when
shall
hear
wars
and
rumors
wars
not
troubled
these
things
must
needs
come
pass
but
the
end
not
yet
Mark
For
nation
shall
rise
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
there
shall
earthquakes
divers
places
there
shall
famines
these
things
are
the
beginning
travail
Mark
But
take
heed
yourselves
for
they
shall
deliver
you
councils
and
synagogues
shall
beaten
and
before
governors
and
kings
shall
stand
for
sake
for
testimony
unto
them
Mark
And
the
gospel
must
first
preached
unto
all
the
nations
Mark
And
when
they
lead
you
judgment
and
deliver
you
not
anxious
beforehand
what
shall
speak
but
whatsoever
shall
given
you
that
hour
that
speak
for
not
that
speak
but
the
Holy
Spirit
Mark
And
brother
shall
deliver
brother
death
and
the
father
his
child
and
children
shall
rise
against
parents
and
cause
them
put
death
Mark
And
shall
hated
all
men
for
name
sake
but
that
endureth
the
end
the
same
shall
saved
Mark
But
when
see
the
abomination
desolation
standing
where
ought
not
let
him
that
readeth
understand
then
let
them
that
are
Judæa
flee
unto
the
mountains
Mark
and
let
him
that
the
housetop
not
down
nor
enter
take
anything
out
his
house
Mark
and
let
him
that
the
field
not
return
back
take
his
cloak
Mark
But
woe
unto
them
that
are
with
child
and
them
that
give
suck
those
days
Mark
And
pray
that
not
the
winter
Mark
For
those
days
shall
tribulation
such
there
hath
not
been
the
like
from
the
beginning
the
creation
which
God
created
until
now
and
never
shall
Mark
And
except
the
Lord
had
shortened
the
days
flesh
would
have
been
saved
but
for
the
elect
sake
whom
chose
shortened
the
days
Mark
And
then
any
man
shall
say
unto
you
here
the
Christ
there
believe
not
Mark
for
there
shall
arise
false
Christs
and
false
prophets
and
shall
show
signs
and
wonders
that
they
may
lead
astray
possible
the
elect
Mark
But
take
heed
behold
have
told
you
all
things
beforehand
Mark
But
those
days
after
that
tribulation
the
sun
shall
darkened
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light
Mark
and
the
stars
shall
falling
from
heaven
and
the
powers
that
are
the
heavens
shall
shaken
Mark
And
then
shall
they
see
the
Son
man
coming
clouds
with
great
power
and
glory
Mark
And
then
shall
send
forth
the
angels
and
shall
gather
together
his
elect
from
the
four
winds
from
the
uttermost
part
the
earth
the
uttermost
part

Mark
Now
from
the
fig
tree
learn
her
parable
when
her
branch
now
become
tender
and
putteth
forth
its
leaves
know
that
the
summer
nigh
Mark
even
also
when
see
these
things
coming
pass
know
that
nigh
even
the
doors
Mark
Verily
say
unto
you
This
generation
shall
not
pass
away
until
all
these
things
accomplished
Mark
Heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
away
but
words
shall
not
pass
away
Mark
But
that
day
that
hour
knoweth
one
not
even
the
angels
heaven
neither
the
Son
but
the
Father
Mark
Take
heed
watch
and
pray
for
know
not
when
the
time
Mark
when
man
sojourning
another
country
having
left
his
house
and
given
authority
his
servants
each
one
his
work
commanded
also
the
porter
watch
Mark
Watch
therefore
for
know
not
when
the
lord
the
house
cometh
whether
even
midnight
cockcrowing
the
morning
Mark
lest
coming
suddenly
find
you
sleeping
Mark
And
what
say
unto
you
say
unto
all
Watch
Mark
Now
after
two
days
was
the
feast
the
passover
and
the
unleavened
bread
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
sought
how
they
might
take
him
with
subtlety
and
kill
him
Mark
for
they
said
Not
during
the
feast
lest
haply
there
shall
tumult
the
people
Mark
And
while
was
Bethany
the
house
Simon
the
leper
sat
meat
there
came
woman
having
alabaster
cruse
ointment
pure
nard
very
costly
and
she
brake
the
cruse
and
poured
over
his
head
Mark
But
there
were
some
that
had
indignation
among
themselves
saying
what
purpose
hath
this
waste
the
ointment
been
made
Mark
For
this
ointment
might
have
been
sold
for
above
three
hundred
shillings
and
given
the
poor
And
they
murmured
against
her
Mark
But
Jesus
said
Let
her
alone
why
trouble
her
she
hath
wrought
good
work
Mark
For
have
the
poor
always
with
you
and
whensoever
will
can
them
good
but
have
not
always
Mark
She
hath
done
what
she
could
she
hath
anointed
body
beforehand
for
the
burying
Mark
And
verily
say
unto
you
Wheresoever
the
gospel
shall
preached
throughout
the
whole
world
that
also
which
this
woman
hath
done
shall
spoken
for
memorial
her
Mark
And
Judas
Iscariot
that
was
one
the
twelve
went
away
unto
the
chief
priests
that
might
deliver
him
unto
them
Mark
And
they
when
they
heard
were
glad
and
promised
give
him
money
And
sought
how
might
conveniently
deliver
him
unto
them
Mark
And
the
first
day
unleavened
bread
when
they
sacrificed
the
passover
his
disciples
say
unto
him
Where
wilt
thou
that
and
make
ready
that
thou
mayest
eat
the
passover
Mark
And
sendeth
two
his
disciples
and
saith
unto
them
into
the
city
and
there
shall
meet
you
man
bearing
pitcher
water
follow
him
Mark
and
wheresoever
shall
enter
say
the
master
the
house
The
Teacher
saith
Where
guest
chamber
where
shall
eat
the
passover
with
disciples
Mark
And
will
himself
show
you
large
upper
room
furnished
and
ready
and
there
make
ready
for
Mark
And
the
disciples
went
forth
and
came
into
the
city
and
found
had
said
unto
them
and
they
made
ready
the
passover
Mark
And
when
was
evening
cometh
with
the
twelve
Mark
And
they
sat
and
were
eating
Jesus
said
Verily
say
unto
you
One
you
shall
betray
even
that
eateth
with
Mark
They
began
sorrowful
and
say
unto
him
one
one
Mark
And
said
unto
them
one
the
twelve
that
dippeth
with
the
dish
Mark
For
the
Son
man
goeth
even
written
him
but
woe
unto
that
man
through
whom
the
Son
man
betrayed
good
were
for
that
man
had
not
been
born
Mark
And
they
were
eating
took
bread
and
when
had
blessed
brake
and
gave
them
and
said
Take
this
body
Mark
And
took
cup
and
when
had
given
thanks
gave
them
and
they
all
drank
Mark
And
said
unto
them
This
blood
the
covenant
which
poured
out
for
many
Mark
Verily
say
unto
you
shall
more
drink
the
fruit
the
vine
until
that
day
when
drink
new
the
kingdom
God
Mark
And
when
they
had
sung
hymn
they
went
out
unto
the
mount
Olives
Mark
And
Jesus
saith
unto
them
All
shall
offended
for
written
will
smite
the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
shall
scattered
abroad
Mark
Howbeit
after
raised
will
before
you
into
Galilee
Mark
But
Peter
said
unto
him
Although
all
shall
offended
yet
will
not
Mark
And
Jesus
saith
unto
him
Verily
say
unto
thee
that
thou
day
even
this
night
before
the
cock
crow
twice
shalt
deny
thrice
Mark
But
spake
exceedingly
vehemently
must
die
with
thee
will
not
deny
thee
And
like
manner
also
said
they
all
Mark
And
they
come
unto
place
which
was
named
Gethsemane
and
saith
unto
his
disciples
Sit
here
while
pray
Mark
And
taketh
with
him
Peter
and
James
and
John
and
began
greatly
amazed
and
sore
troubled
Mark
And
saith
unto
them
soul
exceeding
sorrowful
even
unto
death
abide
here
and
watch
Mark
And
went
forward
little
and
fell
the
ground
and
prayed
that
were
possible
the
hour
might
pass
away
from
him
Mark
And
said
Abba
Father
all
things
are
possible
unto
thee
remove
this
cup
from
howbeit
not
what
will
but
what
thou
wilt
Mark
And
cometh
and
findeth
them
sleeping
and
saith
unto
Peter
Simon
sleepest
thou
couldest
thou
not
watch
one
hour
Mark
Watch
and
pray
that
enter
not
into
temptation
the
spirit
indeed
willing
but
the
flesh
weak
Mark
And
again
went
away
and
prayed
saying
the
same
words
Mark
And
again
came
and
found
them
sleeping
for
their
eyes
were
very
heavy
and
they
knew
not
what
answer
him
Mark
And
cometh
the
third
time
and
saith
unto
them
Sleep
now
and
take
your
rest
enough
the
hour
come
behold
the
Son
man
betrayed
into
the
hands
sinners
Mark
Arise
let
going
behold
that
betrayeth
hand
Mark
And
straightway
while
yet
spake
cometh
Judas
one
the
twelve
and
with
him
multitude
with
swords
and
staves
from
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders
Mark
Now
that
betrayed
him
had
given
them
token
saying
Whomsoever
shall
kiss
that
take
him
and
lead
him
away
safely
Mark
And
when
was
come
straightway
came
him
and
saith
Rabbi
and
kissed
him
Mark
And
they
laid
hands
him
and
took
him
Mark
But
certain
one
them
that
stood
drew
his
sword
and
smote
the
servant
the
high
priest
and
struck
off
his
ear
Mark
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
Are
come
out
against
robber
with
swords
and
staves
seize
Mark
was
daily
with
you
the
temple
teaching
and
took
not
but
this
done
that
the
scriptures
might
fulfilled
Mark
And
they
all
left
him
and
fled
Mark
And
certain
young
man
followed
with
him
having
linen
cloth
cast
about
him
over
his
naked
body
and
they
lay
hold
him
Mark
but
left
the
linen
cloth
and
fled
naked
Mark
And
they
led
Jesus
away
the
high
priest
and
there
come
together
with
him
all
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes
Mark
And
Peter
had
followed
him
afar
off
even
within
into
the
court
the
high
priest
and
was
sitting
with
the
officers
and
warming
himself
the
light
the
fire
Mark
Now
the
chief
priests
and
the
whole
council
sought
witness
against
Jesus
put
him
death
and
found
not
Mark
For
many
bare
false
witness
against
him
and
their
witness
agreed
not
together
Mark
And
there
stood
certain
and
bare
false
witness
against
him
saying
Mark
heard
him
say
will
destroy
this
temple
that
made
with
hands
and
three
days
will
build
another
made
without
hands
Mark
And
not
even
did
their
witness
agree
together
Mark
And
the
high
priest
stood
the
midst
and
asked
Jesus
saying
Answerest
thou
nothing
what
which
these
witness
against
thee
Mark
But
held
his
peace
and
answered
nothing
Again
the
high
priest
asked
him
and
saith
unto
him
Art
thou
the
Christ
the
Son
the
Blessed
Mark
And
Jesus
said
and
shall
see
the
Son
man
sitting
the
right
hand
Power
and
coming
with
the
clouds
heaven
Mark
And
the
high
priest
rent
his
clothes
and
saith
What
further
need
have
witnesses
Mark
have
heard
the
blasphemy
what
think
And
they
all
condemned
him
worthy
death
Mark
And
some
began
spit
him
and
cover
his
face
and
buffet
him
and
say
unto
him
Prophesy
and
the
officers
received
him
with
blows
their
hands
Mark
And
Peter
was
beneath
the
court
there
cometh
one
the
maids
the
high
priest
Mark
and
seeing
Peter
warming
himself
she
looked
upon
him
and
saith
Thou
also
wast
with
the
Nazarene
even
Jesus
Mark
But
denied
saying
neither
know
nor
understand
what
thou
sayest
and
went
out
into
the
porch
and
the
cock
crew
Mark
And
the
maid
saw
him
and
began
again
say
them
that
stood
This
one
them
Mark
But
again
denied
And
after
little
while
again
they
that
stood
said
Peter
truth
thou
art
one
them
for
thou
art
Galilæan
Mark
But
began
curse
and
swear
know
not
this
man
whom
speak
Mark
And
straightway
the
second
time
the
cock
crew
And
Peter
called
mind
the
word
how
that
Jesus
said
unto
him
Before
the
cock
crow
twice
thou
shalt
deny
thrice
And
when
thought
thereon
wept
Mark
And
straightway
the
morning
the
chief
priests
with
the
elders
and
scribes
and
the
whole
council
held
consultation
and
bound
Jesus
and
carried
him
away
and
delivered
him
Pilate
Mark
And
Pilate
asked
him
Art
thou
the
King
the
Jews
And
answering
saith
unto
him
Thou
sayest
Mark
And
the
chief
priests
accused
him
many
things
Mark
And
Pilate
again
asked
him
saying
Answerest
thou
nothing
behold
how
many
things
they
accuse
thee
Mark
But
Jesus
more
answered
anything
insomuch
that
Pilate
marvelled
Mark
Now
the
feast
used
release
unto
them
one
prisoner
whom
they
asked
him
Mark
And
there
was
one
called
Barabbas
lying
bound
with
them
that
had
made
insurrection
men
who
the
insurrection
had
committed
murder
Mark
And
the
multitude
went
and
began
ask
him
was
wont
unto
them
Mark
And
Pilate
answered
them
saying
Will
that
release
unto
you
the
King
the
Jews
Mark
For
perceived
that
for
envy
the
chief
priests
had
delivered
him
Mark
But
the
chief
priests
stirred
the
multitude
that
should
rather
release
Barabbas
unto
them
Mark
And
Pilate
again
answered
and
said
unto
them
What
then
shall
unto
him
whom
call
the
King
the
Jews
Mark
And
they
cried
out
again
Crucify
him
Mark
And
Pilate
said
unto
them
Why
what
evil
hath
done
But
they
cried
out
exceedingly
Crucify
him
Mark
And
Pilate
wishing
content
the
multitude
released
unto
them
Barabbas
and
delivered
Jesus
when
had
scourged
him
crucified
Mark
And
the
soldiers
led
him
away
within
the
court
which
the
Prætorium
and
they
call
together
the
whole
band
Mark
And
they
clothe
him
with
purple
and
platting
crown
thorns
they
put
him
Mark
and
they
began
salute
him
Hail
King
the
Jews
Mark
And
they
smote
his
head
with
reed
and
spat
upon
him
and
bowing
their
knees
worshipped
him
Mark
And
when
they
had
mocked
him
they
took
off
from
him
the
purple
and
put
him
his
garments
And
they
lead
him
out
crucify
him
Mark
And
they
compel
one
passing
Simon
Cyrene
coming
from
the
country
the
father
Alexander
and
Rufus
with
them
that
might
bear
his
cross
Mark
And
they
bring
him
unto
the
place
Golgotha
which
being
interpreted
The
place
skull
Mark
And
they
offered
him
wine
mingled
with
myrrh
but
received
not
Mark
And
they
crucify
him
and
part
his
garments
among
them
casting
lots
upon
them
what
each
should
take
Mark
And
was
the
third
hour
and
they
crucified
him
Mark
And
the
superscription
his
accusation
was
written
over
THE
KING
THE
JEWS
Mark
And
with
him
they
crucify
two
robbers
one
his
right
hand
and
one
his
left
Mark
Mark
And
they
that
passed
railed
him
wagging
their
heads
and
saying
thou
that
destroyest
the
temple
and
buildest
three
days
Mark
save
thyself
and
come
down
from
the
cross
Mark
like
manner
also
the
chief
priests
mocking
him
among
themselves
with
the
scribes
said
saved
others
himself
cannot
save
Mark
Let
the
Christ
the
King
Israel
now
come
down
from
the
cross
that
may
see
and
believe
And
they
that
were
crucified
with
him
reproached
him
Mark
And
when

saying
Let

And
Jesus

And

And
when

And
when

that
the
day
before
the
sabbath
Mark
there
came
Joseph

who
also
himself
was
looking

and
calling

the

And
when

And
Mary

And
when

was
past
Mary
Magdalene
and
Mary
the
mother
James
and
Salome
bought
spices
that
they
might
come
and
anoint
him
Mark
And
very
early
the
first
day
the
week
they
come

tomb
when
the
sun
was
risen
Mark
And
they
were
saying
among
themselves
Who
shall
roll
away
the
stone
from
the
door
the
tomb
Mark
and
looking
they
see
that
the
stone

And
entering
into
the
tomb
they
saw
young
man
sitting

right
side
arrayed
white
robe
and
they
were
amazed
Mark
And
saith
unto
them
not
amazed
seek
Jesus
the
Nazarene
who
hath
been
crucified
risen
not
here
behold
the
place
where
they
laid

Mark
But
tell
his
disciples
and
Peter
goeth
before
you
into
Galilee
there
shall
see
him
said
unto
you
Mark
And
they
went
out
and
fled
from
the
tomb
for
trembling
and
astonishment
had
come
upon
them
and
they
said
nothing
any
one
for
they
were
afraid
Mark
Now
when

risen
early
the
first
day
the
week
appeared
first
Mary
Magdalene
from
whom
had
cast
out
seven
demons
Mark
She
went
and
told
them
that

they
mourned
and
wept
Mark
And
they
when
they
heard
that

alive
and
had
been
seen
her
disbelieved
Mark
And
after
these
things
was
manifested
another
form
unto
two

they
walked
their
way
into
the
country
Mark
And
they
went
away
and
told
unto
the
rest
neither
believed
they
them
Mark
And
afterward
was
manifested
unto
the
eleven
themselves
they
sat
meat
and
upbraided
them
with
their
unbelief
and
hardness
heart
because
they
believed
not
them
that

seen
him
after
was
risen
Mark
And
said
unto
them
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel

whole
creation
Mark
that

And
these
signs
shall
accompany
them
that

Mark
they
shall
take

and
they
drink
any
deadly
thing
shall
wise
hurt
them
they
shall
lay

then
the

Jesus
after
had
spoken
unto
them
was
received
into
heaven
and
sat
down

Mark
And
they
went
forth
and
preached
everywhere
the
Lord
working
with
them
and
confirming
the
word

signs
that
followed

Luke
Forasmuch
many
have
taken
hand
draw
narrative
concerning
those
matters
which
have
been
fulfilled
among

even
they
delivered
them
unto
who
from
the
beginning
were
eyewitnesses
and
ministers

seemed
good
also
having
traced
the
course
all
things
accurately
from
the
first

unto
thee
order
most
excellent
Theophilus
Luke
that
thou
mightest
know
the
certainty
concerning
the
things
wherein
thou
wast
instructed
Luke
There
was
the
days
Herod

certain
priest
named
Zacharias

and

and

Luke
And
they
were
both
righteous
before
God
walking
all
the
commandments
and
ordinances
the
Lord
blameless
Luke
And
they
had
child
because
that
Elisabeth
was
barren
and
they
both
were
now
well

Luke
Now

Luke
And
there
appeared
unto
him
angel
the
Lord
standing

Luke
And
Zacharias
was
troubled
when
saw
him
and
fear
fell
upon
him
Luke
But
the
angel
said
unto
him
Fear
not
Zacharias
because
thy
supplication
heard
and
thy
wife
Elisabeth
shall
bear
thee
son
and
thou
shalt
call
his
name
John
Luke
And
thou
shalt
have
joy
and
gladness
and
many
shall
rejoice
his
birth
Luke
For
shall

the
sight
the
Lord
and
shall
drink
wine
nor
strong
drink
and
shall

with
the
Holy
Spirit
even
from
his
mother
womb
Luke
And
many
the
children
Israel
shall
turn
unto
the
Lord
their

Luke
And
shall

Luke
And
Zacharias
said
unto
the
angel
Whereby

know
this
for
old
man
and
wife
well
stricken
years
Luke
And
the
angel
answering
said
unto
him
Gabriel
that
stand

presence
God
and
was
sent
speak
unto
thee
and
bring
thee
these
good
tidings
Luke
And
behold
thou
shalt
silent
and
not
able
speak
until
the
day
that
these
things
shall
come
pass
because
thou
believedst
not
words
which
shall

their
season
Luke
And
the
people
were
waiting
for
Zacharias
and
they
marvelled
while
tarried
the
temple
Luke
And
when
came
out
could
not
speak
unto
them
and
they
perceived
that
had
seen
vision

temple
and
continued
making
signs
unto
them
and
remained
dumb
Luke
And
came

And
after
these
days
Elisabeth

Luke
But
she
was
greatly
troubled

saying
and
cast
her
mind

And
the
angel
said
unto
her

And

And
Mary
said
unto

answered
and
said
unto
her
The

Most
High
shall
overshadow
thee
wherefore

And

For

And
Mary
said
Behold

departed
from

Luke
And
Mary
arose
these
days
and
went
into
the
hill
country
with
haste
into
city
Judah
Luke
and
entered
into
the
house
Zacharias
and
saluted
Elisabeth
Luke
And
came

when
Elisabeth
heard

and
Elisabeth
was
filled
with
the
Holy

Luke
and
she
lifted
her
voice
with
loud
cry
and
said

thou
among
women
and
blessed

Luke
And

this
that

For

Luke
And

Luke
For

looked
upon
the
low
estate
his

hath
put

princes
from
their
thrones
And

The

And

And
his

answered
and
said
Not
but

Luke
And
they
said
unto
her
There
none
thy
kindred
that

And
they
made
signs

And
asked

and
prophesied
saying

And

who
departed
not
from

And
coming
that
very
hour
she
gave
thanks
unto
God
and
spake
him
all
them
that
were
looking
for
the
redemption
Jerusalem
Luke
And
when
they
had
accomplished
all
things
that
were
according
the
law
the
Lord
they
returned
into
Galilee
their
own
city
Nazareth
Luke
And
the
child
grew
and
waxed
strong
filled
with
wisdom
and
the
grace
God
was
upon
him
Luke
And
his
parents
went
every
year
Jerusalem

feast
the
passover
Luke
And
when
was
twelve
years
old
they
went
after
the
custom
the
feast
Luke
and
when
they
had
fulfilled
the
days
they
were
returning
the
boy
Jesus
tarried
behind
Jerusalem
and
his
parents
knew
not
Luke
but
supposing
him
the
company
they
went
day
journey
and
they
sought
for
him
among
their
kinsfolk
and
acquaintance
Luke
and
when
they
found
him
not
they
returned
Jerusalem
seeking
for
him
Luke
And
came
pass
after
three
days
they
found
him

temple
sitting
the
midst
the
teachers
both
hearing
them
and
asking
them
questions
Luke
and
all
that
heard
him
were
amazed
his
understanding
and
his
answers
Luke
And
when
they
saw
him
they
were
astonished
and
his
mother
said
unto
him
Son
why
hast
thou
thus
dealt
with
behold
thy
father
and
sought
thee
sorrowing
Luke
And
said
unto
them
How
that
sought
knew
not
that
must
Father
house
Luke
And
they
understood
not
the
saying
which
spake
unto
them
Luke
And
went
down
with
them
and
came
Nazareth
and
was
subject
unto
them
and
his
mother
kept
all
these
sayings
her
heart
Luke
And
Jesus
advanced
wisdom
and
stature
and
favor
with
God
and
men
Luke
Now

reign
Tiberius
Cæsar
Pontius
Pilate

Luke
And
came
into
all
the
region
round
about
the
Jordan
preaching
the

repentance
unto

Luke
written
the
book
the
words
Isaiah
the
prophet
The
voice
one
crying
the
wilderness
Make
ready
the
way
the
Lord
Make
his
paths
straight
Luke
Every
valley
shall
filled
And
every
mountain
and
hill
shall
brought
low
And
the
crooked
shall
become
straight
And
the
rough
ways
smooth
Luke
And
all
flesh
shall
see
the
salvation
God
Luke
said
therefore
the
multitudes
that
went
out
baptized
him
offspring
vipers
who
warned
you
flee
from
the
wrath
come
Luke
Bring
forth
therefore
fruits
worthy
repentance
and
begin
not
say
within
yourselves
have
Abraham
our
father
for
say
unto
you
that
God
able
these
stones
raise
children
unto
Abraham
Luke
And
even
now
the
axe
also
lieth
the
root
the
trees
every
tree
therefore
that
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
Luke
And
the
multitudes
asked
him
saying
What
then
must
Luke
And
answered
and
said
unto
them
that
hath
two
coats
let
him
impart
him
that
hath
none
and
that
hath
food
let
him
likewise
Luke
And
there
came
also
publicans
baptized
and
they
said
unto
him
Teacher
what
must
Luke
And
said
unto
them
Extort
more
than
that
which
appointed
you
Luke
And
soldiers
also
asked
him
saying
And
what
must
And
said
unto
them
Extort
from
man
violence
neither
accuse
any
one
wrongfully
and
content
with
your
wages
Luke
And
the
people
were
expectation
and
all
men
reasoned
their
hearts
concerning
John
whether
haply
were
the
Christ
Luke
John
answered
saying
unto
them
all
indeed
baptize
you
with
water
but
there
cometh
that
mightier
than
the
latchet
whose
shoes
not
worthy
unloose
shall
baptize
you
the
Holy
Spirit
and
fire
Luke
whose
fan
his
hand
thoroughly
cleanse
his
threshing
floor
and
gather
the
wheat
into
his
garner
but
the
chaff
will
burn
with
unquenchable
fire
Luke
With
many
other
exhortations
therefore
preached
good
tidings
unto
the
people
Luke
but
Herod
the
tetrarch
being
reproved
him
for
Herodias
his
brother
wife
and
for
all
the
evil
things
which
Herod
had
done
Luke
added
this
also
them
all
that
shut
John
prison
Luke
Now
came
pass
when
all
the
people
were
baptized
that
Jesus
also
having
been
baptized
and
praying
the

opened
Luke

Holy
Spirit
descended

And

said
unto

thou

And
led
him
and
showed
him
all

kingdoms

unto

and
the
glory

for
hath
been
delivered
unto
and
whomsoever
will

thou
therefore

answered
and
said
unto
him
written
Thou
shalt
worship
the
Lord
thy
God
and
him
only
shalt
thou
serve

And
led

said
unto

thou

cast
thyself
down
from
hence

And

into

and
fame
went
out
concerning

through
all
the
region
round
about
Luke
And
taught
their
synagogues
being
glorified
all
Luke
And
came
Nazareth
where
had
been
brought
and
entered
his
custom
was
into
the
synagogue
the
sabbath
day
and
stood
read
Luke
And
there
was
delivered
unto
him
the
book
the
prophet
Isaiah
And
opened
the
book
and
found
the
place
where
was
written
Luke
The
Spirit
the
Lord
upon
Because
anointed
preach
good
tidings
the
poor
hath
sent
proclaim
release
the
captives
And
recovering
sight
the
blind
set
liberty
them
that
are
bruised
Luke
proclaim
the
acceptable
year
the
Lord
Luke
And
closed
the
book
and
gave
back
the
attendant
and
sat
down
and
the
eyes
all
the
synagogue
were
fastened
him
Luke
And
began
say
unto
them
day
hath
this
scripture
been
fulfilled
your
ears
Luke
And
all
bare
him
witness
and
wondered
the
words
grace
which
proceeded
out
his
mouth
and
they
said
not
this
Joseph
son
Luke
And
said
unto
them
Doubtless
will
say
unto
this
parable
Physician
heal
thyself
whatsoever
have
heard
done
Capernaum
also
here
thine
own
country
Luke
And
said
Verily
say
unto
you
prophet
acceptable
his
own
country
Luke
But
truth
say
unto
you
There
were
many
widows
Israel
the
days
Elijah
when
the
heaven
was
shut
three
years
and
six
months
when
there
came
great
famine
over
all
the
land
Luke
and
unto
none
them
was
Elijah
sent
but
only
Zarephath
the
land
Sidon
unto
woman
that
was
widow
Luke
And
there
were
many
lepers
Israel
the
time
Elisha
the
prophet
and
none
them
was
cleansed
but
only
Naaman
the
Syrian
Luke
And
they
were
all
filled
with
wrath
the
synagogue
they
heard
these
things
Luke
and
they
rose
and
cast
him
forth
out
the
city
and
led
him
unto
the
brow
the
hill
whereon
their
city
was
built
that
they
might
throw
him
down
headlong
Luke
But
passing
through
the
midst
them
went
his
way
Luke
And
came
down
Capernaum
city
Galilee
And
was
teaching
them
the
sabbath
day
Luke
and
they
were
astonished
his
teaching
for
his
word
was
with
authority
Luke
And
the
synagogue
there
was
man
that
had
spirit
unclean
demon
and
cried
out
with
loud
voice
Luke
what
have
with
thee
Jesus
thou
Nazarene
art
thou
come
destroy
know
thee
who
thou
art
the
Holy
One
God
Luke
And
Jesus
rebuked
him
saying
Hold
thy
peace
and
come
out
him
And
when
the
demon
had
thrown
him
down
the
midst
came
out
him
having
done
him
hurt
Luke
And
amazement
came
upon
all
and
they
spake
together
one
with
another
saying
What
this
word
for
with
authority
and
power
commandeth
the
unclean
spirits
and
they
come
out
Luke
And
there
went
forth
rumor
concerning
him
into
every
place
the
region
round
about
Luke
And
rose
from
the
synagogue
and
entered
into
the
house
Simon
And
Simon
wife
mother
was
holden
with
great
fever
and
they
besought
him
for
her
Luke
And
stood
over
her
and
rebuked
the
fever
and
left
her
and
immediately
she
rose
and
ministered
unto
them
Luke
And
when
the
sun
was
setting
all
they
that
had
any
sick
with
divers
diseases
brought
them
unto
him
and
laid
his
hands
every
one
them
and
healed
them
Luke
And
demons
also
came
out
from
many
crying
out
and
saying
Thou
art
the
Son
God
And
rebuking
them
suffered
them
not
speak
because
they
knew
that
was
the
Christ
Luke
And
when
was
day
came
out
and
went
into
desert
place
and
the
multitudes
sought
after
him
and
came
unto
him
and
would
have
stayed
him
that
should
not
from
them
Luke
But
said
unto
them
must
preach
the
good
tidings
the
kingdom
God
the
other
cities
also
for
therefore
was
sent
Luke
And
was
preaching
the
synagogues
Galilee
Luke
Now
came
pass
while
the
multitude
pressed
upon
him
and
heard
the
word
God
that
was
standing
the
lake
Gennesaret
Luke
and
saw
two
boats
standing
the
lake
but
the
fishermen
had
gone
out
them
and
were
washing
their
nets
Luke
And
entered
into
one
the
boats
which
was
Simon
and
asked
him
put
out
little
from
the
land
And
sat
down
and
taught
the
multitudes
out
the
boat
Luke
And
when
had
left
speaking
said
unto
Simon
Put
out
into
the
deep
and
let
down
your
nets
for
draught
Luke
And
Simon
answered
and
said
Master
toiled
all
night
and
took
nothing
but
thy
word
will
let
down
the
nets
Luke
And
when
they
had
done
this
they
inclosed
great
multitude
fishes
and
their
nets
were
breaking
Luke
and
they
beckoned
unto
their
partners
the
other
boat
that
they
should
come
and
help
them
And
they
came
and
filled
both
the
boats
that
they
began
sink
Luke
But
Simon
Peter
when
saw
fell
down
Jesus
knees
saying
Depart
from
for
sinful
man
Lord
Luke
For
was
amazed
and
all
that
were
with
him
the
draught
the
fishes
which
they
had
taken
Luke
and
were
also
James
and
John
sons
Zebedee
who
were
partners
with
Simon
And
Jesus
said
unto
Simon
Fear
not
from
henceforth
thou
shalt
catch
men
Luke
And
when
they
had
brought
their
boats
land
they
left
all
and
followed
him
Luke
And
came
pass
while
was
one
the
cities
behold
man
full
leprosy
and
when
saw
Jesus
fell
his
face
and
besought
him
saying
Lord
thou
wilt
thou
canst
make
clean
Luke
And
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
touched
him
saying
will
thou
made
clean
And
straightway
the
leprosy
departed
from
him
Luke
And
charged
him
tell
man
but
thy
way
and
show
thyself
the
priest
and
offer
for
thy
cleansing
according
Moses
commanded
for
testimony
unto
them
Luke
But
much
the
more
went
abroad
the
report
concerning
him
and
great
multitudes
came
together
hear
and
healed
their
infirmities
Luke
But
withdrew
himself
the
deserts
and
prayed
Luke
And
came
pass
one
those
days
that
was
teaching
and
there
were
Pharisees
and
doctors
the
law
sitting
who
were
come
out
every
village
Galilee
and
Judæa
and
Jerusalem
and
the
power
the
Lord
was
with
him
heal
Luke
And
behold
men
bring
bed
man
that
was
palsied
and
they
sought
bring
him
and
lay
him
before
him
Luke
And
not
finding
what
way
they
might
bring
him
because
the
multitude
they
went
the
housetop
and
let
him
down
through
the
tiles
with
his
couch
into
the
midst
before
Jesus
Luke
And
seeing
their
faith
said
Man
thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee
Luke
And
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
began
reason
saying
Who
this
that
speaketh
blasphemies
Who
can
forgive
sins
but
God
alone
Luke
But
Jesus
perceiving
their
reasonings
answered
and
said
unto
them
Why
reason
your
hearts
Luke
Which
easier
say
Thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee
say
Arise
and
walk
Luke
But
that
may
know
that
the
Son
man
hath
authority
earth
forgive
sins
said
unto
him
that
was
palsied
say
unto
thee
Arise
and
take
thy
couch
and
unto
thy
house
Luke
And
immediately
rose
before
them
and
took
that
whereon
lay
and
departed
his
house
glorifying
God
Luke
And
amazement
took
hold
all
and
they
glorified
God
and
they
were
filled
with
fear
saying
have
seen
strange
things
day
Luke
And
after
these
things
went
forth
and
beheld
publican
named
Levi
sitting
the
place
toll
and
said
unto
him
Follow
Luke
And
forsook
all
and
rose
and
followed
him
Luke
And
Levi
made
him
great
feast
his
house
and
there
was
great
multitude
publicans
and
others
that
were
sitting
meat
with
them
Luke
And
the
Pharisees
and
their
scribes
murmured
against
his
disciples
saying
Why
eat
and
drink
with
the
publicans
and
sinners
Luke
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
them
They
that
are
health
have
need
physician
but
they
that
are
sick
Luke
not
come
call
the
righteous
but
sinners

Luke
And
they
said
unto
him
The
disciples
John
fast
often
and
make
supplications
likewise
also
the
disciples
the
Pharisees
but
thine
eat
and
drink
Luke
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
Can
make
the
sons
the
bride
chamber
fast
while
the
bridegroom

them
Luke
But
the
days
will
come
and
when
the
bride
groom
shall
taken
away
from
them
then
will
they
fast
those
days
Luke
And
spake
also
parable
unto
them
man
rendeth
piece
from
new
garment
and
putteth
upon
old
garment
else
will
rend
the
new
and
also
the
piece
from
the
new
will
not
agree
with
the
old
Luke
And
man
putteth
new
wine
into
old
wine
skins
else
the
new
wine
will
burst
the
skins
and
itself
will
spilled
and
the
skins
will
perish
Luke
But
new
wine
must
put
into
fresh
wine
skins
Luke
And
man
having
drunk
old
wine
desireth
new
for
saith
The
old
good
Luke
Now
came
pass
sabbath
that
was
going
through
the
grainfields
and
his
disciples
plucked
the
ears
and
did
eat
rubbing
them
their
hands
Luke
But
certain
the
Pharisees
said
Why
that
which
not
lawful
the
sabbath
day
Luke
And
Jesus
answering
them
said
Have
not
read
even
this
what
David
did
when
was
hungry
and
they
that
were
with
him
Luke
how
entered
into
the
house
God
and
took
and
ate
the
showbread
and
gave
also
them
that
were
with
him
which
not
lawful
eat
save
for
the
priests
alone
Luke
And
said
unto
them
The
Son
man
lord
the
sabbath
Luke
And
came
pass
another
sabbath
that
entered
into
the
synagogue
and
taught
and
there
was
man
there
and
his
right
hand
was
withered
Luke
And
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
watched
him
whether
would
heal
the
sabbath
that
they
might
find
how
accuse
him
Luke
But
knew
their
thoughts
and
said
the
man
that
had
his
hand
withered
Rise
and
stand
forth
the
midst
And
arose
and
stood
forth
Luke
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
ask
you
lawful
the
sabbath
good
harm
save
life
destroy
Luke
And
looked
round
about
them
all
and
said
unto
him
Stretch
forth
thy
hand
And
did
and
his
hand
was
restored
Luke
But
they
were
filled
with
madness
and
communed
one
with
another
what
they
might
Jesus
Luke
And
came
pass
these
days
that
went
out
into
the
mountain
pray
and
continued
all
night
prayer
God
Luke
And
when
was
day
called
his
disciples
and
chose
from
them
twelve
whom
also
named
apostles
Luke
Simon
whom
also
named
Peter
and
Andrew
his
brother
and
James
and
John
and
Philip
and
Bartholomew
Luke
and
Matthew
and
Thomas
and
James
the

Alphæus
and
Simon
who
was
called
the
Zealot
Luke
and
Judas
the
son
James
and
Judas
Iscariot
who
became
traitor
Luke
and
came
down
with
them
and
stood
level
place
and
great
multitude
his
disciples
and
great
number
the
people
from
all
Judæa
and
Jerusalem
and
the
sea
coast
Tyre
and
Sidon
who
came
hear
him
and
healed
their
diseases
Luke
and
they
that
were
troubled
with
unclean
spirits
were
healed
Luke
And
all
the
multitude
sought
touch
him
for
power
came
forth
from
him
and
healed
them
all
Luke
And
lifted
his
eyes
his
disciples
and
said
Blessed
are
poor
for
yours
the
kingdom
God
Luke
Blessed
are
that
hunger
now
for
shall
filled
Blessed

that
weep

Luke
Blessed
are
when
men
shall
hate
you
and
when
they
shall
separate
you
from
their
company
and
reproach
you
and
cast
out
your
name
evil
for
the
Son
man
sake
Luke
Rejoice
that
day
and
leap
for
joy
for
behold
your
reward
great
heaven
for
the
same
manner
did
their
fathers
unto
the
prophets
Luke
But
woe
unto
you
that
are
rich
for
have
received
your
consolation
Luke
Woe
unto
you
that
are
full
now
for
shall
hunger
Woe
unto
you
that
laugh
now
for
shall
mourn
and
weep
Luke
Woe
unto
you
when
all
men
shall
speak
well
you
for
the
same
manner
did
their
fathers
the
false
prophets
Luke
But
say
unto
you
that
hear
Love
your
enemies
good
them
that
hate
you
Luke
bless
them
that

pray
for
them
that

Luke
him
that
smiteth
thee
the
one
cheek
offer

the
other
and
from
him
that
taketh
away
thy
cloak
withhold
not

Luke
Give
every
one
that
asketh
thee
and
him
that
taketh
away
thy
goods
ask
them
not

Luke
And
would
that
men
should

Luke
And
love
them
that
love
you
what

for
even
sinners
love
those

Luke
And
good
them
that

the
same
Luke
And
lend
them
whom

what

much
Luke
But
love
your
enemies
and
them
good
and
lend
never
despairing
and
your
reward
shall
great
and

sons
the
Most

And

bosom
For

Luke
And
spake
also
parable
unto
them
Can
the
blind
guide
the
blind
shall
they
not
both
fall
into
pit
Luke
The
disciple
not
above
his
teacher
but
every
one
when
perfected
shall
his
teacher
Luke
And
why
beholdest
thou
the
mote
that
thy
brother
eye
but
considerest
not
the
beam
that
thine
own
eye
Luke
how
canst
thou
say
thy
brother
Brother
let
cast
out
the
mote
that
thine
eye
when
thou
thyself
beholdest
not
the
beam
that
thine
own

Thou
hypocrite
cast
out
first
the
beam
out
thine
own
eye
and
then
shalt
thou
see

cast
out
the
mote

Luke
For
there
good
tree
that
bringeth
forth
corrupt
fruit
nor
again
corrupt
tree
that
bringeth
forth
good
fruit
Luke
For
each
tree
known
its
own
fruit
For
thorns
men
not
gather
figs
nor
bramble
bush
gather
they
grapes
Luke
The
good
man
out
the
good
treasure
his
heart
bringeth
forth
that
which
good
and
the
evil
man
out
the
evil
treasure
bringeth
forth
that
which
evil
for
out
the
abundance
the
heart
his
mouth
speaketh
Luke
And
why
call
Lord
Lord
and
not
the
things
which
say
Luke
Every
one
that
cometh
unto
and
heareth
words
and
doeth
them
will
show
you
whom
like
Luke
like
man
building
house
who
digged
and
went
deep
and
laid
foundation
upon
the
rock
and
when
flood
arose
the
stream
brake
against
that
house
and
could
not
shake
because
had
been
well
builded
Luke
But
that
heareth
and
doeth
not
like
man
that
built
house
upon
the
earth
without
foundation
against
which
the
stream
brake
and
straightway
fell
and
the
ruin
that
house
was
great
Luke
After
had
ended
all
his
sayings
the
ears
the
people
entered
into
Capernaum
Luke
And
certain
centurion
servant
who
was
dear
unto
him
was
sick
and
the
point
death
Luke
And
when
heard
concerning
Jesus
sent
unto
him
elders
the
Jews
asking
him
that
would
come
and
save
his
servant
Luke
And
they
when
they
came
Jesus
besought
him
earnestly
saying
worthy
that
thou
shouldest
this
for
him
Luke
for
loveth
our
nation
and
himself
built
our
synagogue
Luke
And
Jesus
went
with
them
And
when
was
now
not
far
from
the
house
the
centurion
sent
friends
him
saying
unto
him
Lord
trouble
not
thyself
for
not
worthy
that
thou
shouldest
come
under
roof
Luke
wherefore
neither
thought
myself
worthy
come
unto
thee
but
say
the
word
and
servant
shall
healed
Luke
For
also
man
set
under
authority
having
under
myself
soldiers
and
say
this
one
and
goeth
and
another
Come
and
cometh
and
servant
this
and
doeth
Luke
And
when
Jesus
heard
these
things
marvelled
him
and
turned
and
said
unto
the
multitude
that
followed
him
say
unto
you
have
not
found
great
faith
not
Israel
Luke
And
they
that
were
sent
returning
the
house
found
the
servant
whole
Luke
And
came
pass
soon
afterwards
that
went
city
called
Nain
and
his
disciples
went
with
him
and
great
multitude
Luke
Now
when
drew
near
the
gate
the
city
behold
there
was
carried
out
one
that
was
dead
the
only
son
his
mother
and
she
was
widow
and
much
people
the
city
was
with
her
Luke
And
when
the
Lord
saw
her
had
compassion
her
and
said
unto
her
Weep
not
Luke
And
came
nigh
and
touched
the
bier
and
the
bearers
stood
still
And
said
Young
man
say
unto
thee
Arise
Luke
And
that
was
dead
sat
and
began
speak
And
gave
him
his
mother
Luke
And
fear
took
hold
all
and
they
glorified
God
saying
great
prophet
arisen
among
and
God
hath
visited
his
people
Luke
And
this
report
went
forth
concerning
him
the
whole
Judæa
and
all
the
region
round
about
Luke
And
the
disciples
John
told
him
all
these
things
Luke
And
John
calling
unto
him
two
his
disciples
sent
them
the
Lord
saying
Art
thou
that
cometh
look
for
another
Luke
And
when
the
men
were
come
unto
him
they
said
John
the
Baptist
hath
sent
unto
thee
saying
Art
thou
that
cometh
look
for
another
Luke
that
hour
cured
many
diseases
and
plagues
and
evil
spirits
and
many
that
were
blind
bestowed
sight
Luke
And
answered
and
said
unto
them
and
tell
John
the
things
which
have
seen
and
heard
the
blind
receive
their
sight
the
lame
walk
the
lepers
are
cleansed
and
the
deaf
hear
the
dead
are
raised
the
poor
have
good
tidings
preached
them
Luke
And
blessed
whosoever
shall
find
occasion
stumbling
Luke
And
when
the
messengers
John
were
departed
began
say
unto
the
multitudes
concerning
John
What
went
out
into
the
wilderness
behold
reed
shaken
with
the
wind
Luke
But
what
went
out
see
man
clothed
soft
raiment
Behold
they
that
are
gorgeously
apparelled
and
live
delicately
are
kings
courts
Luke
But
what
went
out
see
prophet
Yea
say
unto
you
and
much
more
than
prophet
Luke
This
whom
written
Behold
send
messenger
before
thy
face
Who
shall
prepare
thy
way
before
thee
Luke
say
unto
you
Among
them
that
are
born
women
there
none
greater
than
John
yet
that
but
little
the
kingdom
God
greater
than
Luke
And
all
the
people
when
they
heard
and
the
publicans
justified
God
being
baptized
with
the
baptism
John
Luke
But
the
Pharisees
and
the
lawyers
rejected
for
themselves
the
counsel
God
being
not
baptized
him
Luke
Whereunto
then
shall
liken
the
men
this
generation
and
what
are
they
like
Luke
They
are
like
unto
children
that
sit
the
marketplace
and
call
one
another
who
say
piped
unto
you
and
did
not
dance
wailed
and
did
not
weep
Luke
For
John
the
Baptist
come
eating
bread
nor
drinking
wine
and
say
hath
demon
Luke
The
Son
man
come
eating
and
drinking
and
say
Behold
gluttonous
man
and
winebibber
friend
publicans
and
sinners
Luke
And
wisdom
justified
all
her
children
Luke
And
one
the
Pharisees
desired
him
that
would
eat
with
him
And
entered
into
the
Pharisee
house
and
sat
down
meat
Luke
And
behold
woman
who
was
the
city
sinner
and
when
she
knew
that
was
sitting
meat
the
Pharisee
house
she
brought
alabaster
cruse
ointment
Luke
and
standing
behind
his
feet
weeping
she
began
wet
his
feet
with
her
tears
and
wiped
them
with
the
hair
her
head
and
kissed
his
feet
and
anointed
them
with
the
ointment
Luke
Now
when
the
Pharisee
that
had
bidden
him
saw
spake
within
himself
saying
This
man
were
prophet
would
have
perceived
who
and
what
manner
woman
this
that
toucheth
him
that
she
sinner
Luke
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
him
Simon
have
somewhat
say
unto
thee
And
saith
Teacher
say
Luke
certain
lender
had
two
debtors
the
one
owed
five
hundred
shillings
and
the
other
fifty
Luke
When
they
had
not
wherewith
pay
forgave
them
both
Which
them
therefore
will
love
him
most
Luke
Simon
answered
and
said
suppose
whom
forgave
the
most
And
said
unto
him
Thou
hast
rightly
judged
Luke
And
turning
the
woman
said
unto
Simon
Seest
thou
this
woman
entered
into
thy
house
thou
gavest
water
for
feet
but
she
hath
wetted
feet
with
her
tears
and
wiped
them
with
her
hair
Luke
Thou
gavest
kiss
but
she
since
the
time
came
hath
not
ceased
kiss
feet
Luke
head
with
oil
thou
didst
not
anoint
but
she
hath
anointed
feet
with
ointment
Luke
Wherefore
say
unto
thee
Her
sins
which
are
many
are
forgiven
for
she
loved
much
but
whom
little
forgiven
the
same
loveth
little
Luke
And
said
unto
her
Thy
sins
are
forgiven
Luke
And
they
that
sat
meat
with
him
began
say
within
themselves
Who
this
that
even
forgiveth
sins
Luke
And
said
unto
the
woman
Thy
faith
hath
saved
thee
peace
Luke
And
came
pass
soon
afterwards
that
went
about
through
cities
and
villages
preaching
and
bringing
the
good
tidings
the
kingdom
God
and
with
him
the
twelve
Luke
and
certain
women
who
had
been
healed
evil
spirits
and
infirmities
Mary
that
was
called
Magdalene
from
whom
seven
demons
had
gone
out
Luke
and
Joanna
the
wife
Chuzas
Herod
steward
and
Susanna
and
many
others
who
ministered
unto
them
their
substance
Luke
And
when
great
multitude
came
together
and
they
every
city
resorted
unto
him
spake
parable
Luke
The
sower
went
forth
sow
his
seed
and
sowed
some
fell
the
way
side
and
was
trodden
under
foot
and
the
birds
the
heaven
devoured
Luke
And
other
fell
the
rock
and
soon
grew
withered
away
because
had
moisture
Luke
And
other
fell
amidst
the
thorns
and
the
thorns
grew
with
and
choked
Luke
And
other
fell
into
the
good
ground
and
grew
and
brought
forth
fruit
hundredfold
said
these
things
cried
that
hath
ears
hear
let
him
hear
Luke
And
his
disciples
asked
him
what
this
parable
might
Luke
And
said
Unto
you
given
know
the
mysteries
the
kingdom
God
but
the
rest
parables
that
seeing
they
may
not
see
and
hearing
they
may
not
understand
Luke
Now
the
parable
this
The
seed
the
word
God
Luke
And
those
the
way
side
are
they
that
have
heard
then
cometh
the
devil
and
taketh
away
the
word
from
their
heart
that
they
may
not
believe
and
saved
Luke
And
those
the
rock
are
they
who
when
they
have
heard
receive
the
word
with
joy
and
these
have
root
who
for
while
believe
and
time
temptation
fall
away
Luke
And
that
which
fell
among
the
thorns
these
are
they
that
have
heard
and
they
their
way
they
are
choked
with
cares
and
riches
and
pleasures
this
life
and
bring
fruit
perfection
Luke
And
that
the
good
ground
these
are
such
honest
and
good
heart
having
heard
the
word
hold
fast
and
bring
forth
fruit
with
patience
Luke
And
man
when
hath
lighted
lamp
covereth
with
vessel
putteth
under
bed
but
putteth
stand
that
they
that
enter
may
see
the
light
Luke
For
nothing
hid
that
shall
not
made
manifest
nor
anything
secret
that
shall
not
known
and
come
light
Luke
Take
heed
therefore
how
hear
for
whosoever
hath
him
shall
given
and
whosoever
hath
not
from
him
shall
taken
away
even
that
which
thinketh
hath
Luke
And
there
came
him
his
mother
and
brethren
and
they
could
not
come
him
for
the
crowd
Luke
And
was
told
him
Thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
stand
without
desiring
see
thee
Luke
But
answered
and
said
unto
them
mother
and
brethren
are
these
that
hear
the
word
God
and
Luke
Now
came
pass
one
those
days
that
entered
into
boat
himself
and
his
disciples
and
said
unto
them
Let
over
unto
the
other
side
the
lake
and
they
launched
forth
Luke
But
they
sailed
fell
asleep
and
there
came
down
storm
wind
the
lake
and
they
were
filling
with
water
and
were
jeopardy
Luke
And
they
came
him
and
awoke
him
saying
Master
master
perish
And
awoke
and
rebuked
the
wind
and
the
raging
the
water
and
they
ceased
and
there
was
calm
Luke
And
said
unto
them
Where
your
faith
And
being
afraid
they
marvelled
saying
one
another
Who
then
this
that
commandeth
even
the
winds
and
the
water
and
they
obey
him
Luke
And
they
arrived
the
country
the
Gerasenes
which
over
against
Galilee
Luke
And
when
was
come
forth
upon
the
land
there
met
him
certain
man
out
the
city
who
had
demons
and
for
long
time
had
worn
clothes
and
abode
not
any
house
but
the
tombs
Luke
And
when
saw
Jesus
cried
out
and
fell
down
before
him
and
with
loud
voice
said
What
have
with
thee
Jesus
thou
Son
the
Most
High
God
beseech
thee
torment
not
Luke
For
was
commanding
the
unclean
spirit
come
out
from
the
man
For
oftentimes
had
seized
him
and
was
kept
under
guard
and
bound
with
chains
and
fetters
and
breaking
the
bands
asunder
was
driven
the
demon
into
the
deserts
Luke
And
Jesus
asked
him
What
thy
name
And
said
Legion
for
many
demons
were
entered
into
him
Luke
And
they
entreated
him
that
would
not
command
them
depart
into
the
abyss
Luke
Now
there
was
there
herd
many
swine
feeding
the
mountain
and
they
entreated
him
that
would
give
them
leave
enter
into
them
And
gave
them
leave
Luke
And
the
demons
came
out
from
the
man
and
entered
into
the
swine
and
the
herd
rushed
down
the
steep
into
the
lake
and
were
drowned
Luke
And
when
they
that
fed
them
saw
what
had
come
pass
they
fled
and
told
the
city
and
the
country
Luke
And
they
went
out
see
what
had
come
pass
and
they
came
Jesus
and
found
the
man
from
whom
the
demons
were
gone
out
sitting
clothed
and
his
right
mind
the
feet
Jesus
and
they
were
afraid
Luke
And
they
that
saw
told
them
how
that
was
possessed
with
demons
was
made
whole
Luke
And
all
the
people
the
country
the
Gerasenes
round
about
asked
him
depart
from
them
for
they
were
holden
with
great
fear
and
entered
into
boat
and
returned
Luke
But
the
man
from
whom
the
demons
were
gone
out
prayed
him
that
might
with
him
but
sent
him
away
saying
Luke
Return
thy
house
and
declare
how
great
things
God
hath
done
for
thee
And
went
his
way
publishing
throughout
the
whole
city
how
great
things
Jesus
had
done
for
him
Luke
And
Jesus
returned
the
multitude
welcomed
him
for
they
were
all
waiting
for
him
Luke
And
behold
there
came
man
named
Jairus
and
was
ruler
the
synagogue
and
fell
down
Jesus
feet
and
besought
him
come
into
his
house
Luke
for
had
only
daughter
about
twelve
years
age
and
she
was
dying
But
went
the
multitudes
thronged
him
Luke
And
woman
having
issue
blood
twelve
years
who
had
spent
all
her
living
upon
physicians
and
could
not
healed
any
Luke
came
behind
him
and
touched
the
border
his
garment
and
immediately
the
issue
her
blood
stanched
Luke
And
Jesus
said
Who
that
touched
And
when
all
denied
Peter
said
and
they
that
were
with
him
Master
the
multitudes
press
thee
and
crush
thee
Luke
But
Jesus
said
Some
one
did
touch
for
perceived
that
power
had
gone
forth
from
Luke
And
when
the
woman
saw
that
she
was
not
hid
she
came
trembling
and
falling
down
before
him
declared
the
presence
all
the
people
for
what
cause
she
touched
him
and
how
she
was
healed
immediately
Luke
And
said
unto
her
Daughter
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole
peace
Luke
While
yet
spake
there
cometh
one
from
the
ruler
the
synagogue
house
saying
Thy
daughter
dead
trouble
not
the
Teacher
Luke
But
Jesus
hearing
answered
him
Fear
not
only
believe
and
she
shall
made
whole
Luke
And
when
came
the
house
suffered
not
any
man
enter
with
him
save
Peter
and
John
and
James
and
the
father
the
maiden
and
her
mother
Luke
And
all
were
weeping
and
bewailing
her
but
said
Weep
not
for
she
not
dead
but
sleepeth
Luke
And
they
laughed
him
scorn
knowing
that
she
was
dead
Luke
But
taking
her
the
hand
called
saying
Maiden
arise
Luke
And
her
spirit
returned
and
she
rose
immediately
and
commanded
that
something
given
her
eat
Luke
And
her
parents
were
amazed
but
charged
them
tell
man
what
had
been
done
Luke
And
called
the
twelve
together
and
gave
them
power
and
authority
over
all
demons
and
cure
diseases
Luke
And
sent
them
forth
preach
the
kingdom
God
and
heal
the
sick
Luke
And
said
unto
them
Take
nothing
for
your
journey
neither
staff
nor
wallet
nor
bread
nor
money
neither
have
two
coats
Luke
And
into
whatsoever
house
enter
there
abide
and
thence
depart
Luke
And
many
receive
you
not
when
depart
from
that
city
shake
off
the
dust
from
your
feet
for
testimony
against
them
Luke
And
they
departed
and
went
throughout
the
villages
preaching
the
gospel
and
healing
everywhere
Luke
Now
Herod
the
tetrarch
heard
all
that
was
done
and
was
much
perplexed
because
that
was
said
some
that
John
was
risen
from
the
dead
Luke
and
some
that
Elijah
had
appeared
and
others
that
one
the
old
prophets
was
risen
again
Luke
And
Herod
said
John
beheaded
but
who
this
about
whom
hear
such
things
And
sought
see
him
Luke
And
the
apostles
when
they
were
returned
declared
unto
him
what
things
they
had
done
And
took
them
and
withdrew
apart
city
called
Bethsaida
Luke
But
the
multitudes
perceiving
followed
him
and
welcomed
them
and
spake
them
the
kingdom
God
and
them
that
had
need
healing
cured
Luke
And
the
day
began
wear
away
and
the
twelve
came
and
said
unto
him
Send
the
multitude
away
that
they
may
into
the
villages
and
country
round
about
and
lodge
and
get
provisions
for
are
here
desert
place
Luke
But
said
unto
them
Give
them
eat
And
they
said
have
more
than
five
loaves
and
two
fishes
except
should
and
buy
food
for
all
this
people
Luke
For
they
were
about
five
thousand
men
And
said
unto
his
disciples
Make
them
sit
down
companies
about
fifty
each
Luke
And
they
did
and
made
them
all
sit
down
Luke
And
took
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fishes
and
looking
heaven
blessed
them
and
brake
and
gave
the
disciples
set
before
the
multitude
Luke
And
they
ate
and
were
all
filled
and
there
was
taken
that
which
remained
over
them
broken
pieces
twelve
baskets
Luke
And
came
pass
was
praying
apart
the
disciples
were
with
him
and
asked
them
saying
Who
the
multitudes
say
that
Luke
And
they
answering
said
John
the
Baptist
but
others
say
Elijah
and
others
that
one
the
old
prophets
risen
again
Luke
And
said
unto
them
But
who
say
that
And
Peter
answering
said
The
Christ
God
Luke
But
charged
them
and
commanded
them
tell
this
man
Luke
saying
The
Son
man
must
suffer
many
things
and
rejected
the
elders
and
chief
priests
and
scribes
and
killed
and
the
third
day
raised
Luke
And
said
unto
all
any
man
would
come
after
let
him
deny
himself
and
take
his
cross
daily
and
follow
Luke
For
whosoever
would
save
his
life
shall
lose
but
whosoever
shall
lose
his
life
for
sake
the
same
shall
save
Luke
For
what
man
profited
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
forfeit
his
own
self
Luke
For
whosoever
shall
ashamed
and
words
him
shall
the
Son
man
ashamed
when
cometh
his
own
glory
and
the
glory
the
Father
and
the
holy
angels
Luke
But
tell
you
truth
There
are
some
them
that
stand
here
who
shall
wise
taste
death
till
they
see
the
kingdom
God
Luke
And
came
pass
about
eight
days
after
these
sayings
that
took
with
him
Peter
and
John
and
James
and
went
into
the
mountain
pray
Luke
And
was
praying
the
fashion
his
countenance
was
altered
and
his
raiment
became
white
and
dazzling
Luke
And
behold
there
talked
with
him
two
men
who
were
Moses
and
Elijah
Luke
who
appeared
glory
and
spake
his
decease
which
was
about
accomplish
Jerusalem
Luke
Now
Peter
and
they
that
were
with
him
were
heavy
with
sleep
but
when
they
were
fully
awake
they
saw
his
glory
and
the
two
men
that
stood
with
him
Luke
And
came
pass
they
were
parting
from
him
Peter
said
unto
Jesus
Master
good
for
here
and
let
make
three
tabernacles
one
for
thee
and
one
for
Moses
and
one
for
Elijah
not
knowing
what
said
Luke
And
while
said
these
things
there
came
cloud
and
overshadowed
them
and
they
feared
they
entered
into
the
cloud
Luke
And
voice
came
out
the
cloud
saying
This
Son
chosen
hear
him
Luke
And
when
the
voice
came
Jesus
was
found
alone
And
they
held
their
peace
and
told
man
those
days
any
the
things
which
they
had
seen
Luke
And
came
pass
the
next
day
when
they
were
come
down
from
the
mountain
great
multitude
met
him
Luke
And
behold
man
from
the
multitude
cried
saying
Teacher
beseech
thee
look
upon
son
for
mine
only
child
Luke
and
behold
spirit
taketh
him
and
suddenly
crieth
out
and
teareth
him
that
foameth
and
hardly
departeth
from
him
bruising
him
sorely
Luke
And
besought
thy
disciples
cast
out
and
they
could
not
Luke
And
Jesus
answered
and
said
faithless
and
perverse
generation
how
long
shall
with
you
and
bear
with
you
bring
hither
thy
son
Luke
And
was
yet
coming
the
demon
dashed
him
down
and
tare
him
grievously
But
Jesus
rebuked
the
unclean
spirit
and
healed
the
boy
and
gave
him
back
his
father
Luke
And
they
were
all
astonished
the
majesty
God
But
while
all
were
marvelling
all
the
things
which
did
said
unto
his
disciples
Luke
Let
these
words
sink
into
your
ears
for
the
Son
man
shall
delivered
into
the
hands
men
Luke
But
they
understood
not
this
saying
and
was
concealed
from
them
that
they
should
not
perceive
and
they
were
afraid
ask
him
about
this
saying
Luke
And
there
arose
reasoning
among
them
which
them
was
the
greatest
Luke
But
when
Jesus
saw
the
reasoning
their
heart
took
little
child
and
set
him
his
side
Luke
and
said
unto
them
Whosoever
shall
receive
this
little
child
name
receiveth
and
whosoever
shall
receive
receiveth
him
that
sent
for
that
least
among
you
all
the
same
great
Luke
And
John
answered
and
said
Master
saw
one
casting
out
demons
thy
name
and
forbade
him
because
followeth
not
with
Luke
But
Jesus
said
unto
him
Forbid
him
not
for
that
not
against
you
for
you
Luke
And
came
pass
when
the
days
were
well
nigh
come
that
should
received
stedfastly
set
his
face
Jerusalem
Luke
and
sent
messengers
before
his
face
and
they
went
and
entered
into
village
the
Samaritans
make
ready
for
him
Luke
And
they
did
not
receive
him
because
his
face
was
though
were
going
Jerusalem
Luke
And
when
his
disciples
James
and
John
saw
this
they
said
Lord
wilt
thou
that
bid
fire
come
down
from
heaven
and
consume
them
Luke
But
turned
and
rebuked
them
Luke
And
they
went
another
village
Luke
And
they
went
the
way
certain
man
said
unto
him
will
follow
thee
whithersoever
thou
goest
Luke
And
Jesus
said
unto
him
The
foxes
have
holes
and
the
birds
the
heaven
have
nests
but
the
Son
man
hath
not
where
lay
his
head
Luke
And
said
unto
another
Follow
But
said
Lord
suffer
first
and
bury
father
Luke
But
said
unto
him
Leave
the
dead
bury
their
own
dead
but
thou
and
publish
abroad
the
kingdom
God
Luke
And
another
also
said
will
follow
thee
Lord
but
first
suffer
bid
farewell
them
that
are
house
Luke
But
Jesus
said
unto
him
man
having
put
his
hand
the
plow
and
looking
back
fit
for
the
kingdom
God
Luke
Now
after
these
things
the
Lord
appointed
seventy
others
and
sent
them
two
and
two
before
his
face
into
every
city
and
place
whither
himself
was
about
come
Luke
And
said
unto
them
The
harvest
indeed
plenteous
but
the
laborers
are
few
pray
therefore
the
Lord
the
harvest
that
send
forth
laborers
into
his
harvest
Luke
your
ways
behold
send
you
forth
lambs
the
midst
wolves
Luke
Carry
purse
wallet
shoes
and
salute
man
the
way
Luke
And
into
whatsoever
house
shall
enter
first
say
Peace
this
house
Luke
And
son
peace
there
your
peace
shall
rest
upon
him
but
not
shall
turn
you
again
Luke
And
that
same
house
remain
eating
and
drinking
such
things
they
give
for
the
laborer
worthy
his
hire
not
from
house
house
Luke
And
into
whatsoever
city
enter
and
they
receive
you
eat
such
things
are
set
before
you
Luke
and
heal
the
sick
that
are
therein
and
say
unto
them
The
kingdom
God
come
nigh
unto
you
Luke
But
into
whatsoever
city
shall
enter
and
they
receive
you
not
out
into
the
streets
thereof
and
say
Luke
Even
the
dust
from
your
city
that
cleaveth
our
feet
wipe
off
against
you
nevertheless
know
this
that
the
kingdom
God
come
nigh
Luke
say
unto
you
shall
more
tolerable
that
day
for
Sodom
than
for
that
city
Luke
Woe
unto
thee
Chorazin
woe
unto
thee
Bethsaida
for
the
mighty
works
had
been
done
Tyre
and
Sidon
which
were
done
you
they
would
have
repented
long
ago
sitting
sackcloth
and
ashes
Luke
But
shall
more
tolerable
for
Tyre
and
Sidon
the
judgment
than
for
you
Luke
And
thou
Capernaum
shalt
thou
exalted
unto
heaven
thou
shalt
brought
down
unto
Hades
Luke
that
heareth
you
heareth
and
that
rejecteth
you
rejecteth
and
that
rejecteth
rejecteth
him
that
sent
Luke
And
the
seventy
returned
with
joy
saying
Lord
even
the
demons
are
subject
unto
thy
name
Luke
And
said
unto
them
beheld
Satan
fallen
lightning
from
heaven
Luke
Behold
have
given
you
authority
tread
upon
serpents
and
scorpions
and
over
all
the
power
the
enemy
and
nothing
shall
any
wise
hurt
you
Luke
Nevertheless
this
rejoice
not
that
the
spirits
are
subject
unto
you
but
rejoice
that
your
names
are
written
heaven
Luke
that
same
hour
rejoiced
the
Holy
Spirit
and
said
thank
thee
Father
Lord
heaven
and
earth
that
thou
didst
hide
these
things
from
the
wise
and
understanding
and
didst
reveal
them
unto
babes
yea
Father
for
was
well
pleasing
thy
sight
Luke
All
things
have
been
delivered
unto
Father
and
one
knoweth
who
the
Son
save
the
Father
and
who
the
Father
save
the
Son
and
whomsoever
the
Son
willeth
reveal
him
Luke
And
turning
the
disciples
said
privately
Blessed
are
the
eyes
which
see
the
things
that
see
Luke
for
say
unto
you
that
many
prophets
and
kings
desired
see
the
things
which
see
and
saw
them
not
and
hear
the
things
which
hear
and
heard
them
not
Luke
And
behold
certain
lawyer
stood
and
made
trial
him
saying
Teacher
what
shall
inherit
eternal
life
Luke
And
said
unto
him
What
written
the
law
how
readest
thou
Luke
And
answering
said
Thou
shalt
love
the
Lord
thy
God
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
strength
and
with
all
thy
mind
and
thy
neighbor
thyself
Luke
And
said
unto
him
Thou
hast
answered
right
this
and
thou
shalt
live
Luke
But
desiring
justify
himself
said
unto
Jesus
And
who
neighbor
Luke
Jesus
made
answer
and
said
certain
man
was
going
down
from
Jerusalem
Jericho
and
fell
among
robbers
who
both
stripped
him
and
beat
him
and
departed
leaving
him
half
dead
Luke
And
chance
certain
priest
was
going
down
that
way
and
when
saw
him
passed
the
other
side
Luke
And
like
manner
Levite
also
when
came
the
place
and
saw
him
passed
the
other
side
Luke
But
certain
Samaritan
journeyed
came
where
was
and
when
saw
him
was
moved
with
compassion
Luke
and
came
him
and
bound
his
wounds
pouring
them
oil
and
wine
and
set
him
his
own
beast
and
brought
him
inn
and
took
care
him
Luke
And
the
morrow
took
out
two
shillings
and
gave
them
the
host
and
said
Take
care
him
and
whatsoever
thou
spendest
more
when
come
back
again
will
repay
thee
Luke
Which
these
three
thinkest
thou
proved
neighbor
unto
him
that
fell
among
the
robbers
Luke
And
said
that
showed
mercy
him
And
Jesus
said
unto
him
and
thou
likewise
Luke
Now
they
went
their
way
entered
into
certain
village
and
certain
woman
named
Martha
received
him
into
her
house
Luke
And
she
had
sister
called
Mary
who
also
sat
the
Lord
feet
and
heard
his
word
Luke
But
Martha
was
cumbered
about
much
serving
and
she
came
him
and
said
Lord
dost
thou
not
care
that
sister
did
leave
serve
alone
bid
her
therefore
that
she
help
Luke
But
the
Lord
answered
and
said
unto
her
Martha
Martha
thou
art
anxious
and
troubled
about
many
things
Luke
but
one
thing
needful
for
Mary
hath
chosen
the
good
part
which
shall
not
taken
away
from
her
Luke
And
came
pass
was
praying
certain
place
that
when
ceased
one
his
disciples
said
unto
him
Lord
teach
pray
even
John
also
taught
his
disciples
Luke
And
said
unto
them
When
pray
say
Father
hallowed
thy
name
Thy
kingdom
come
Luke
Give
day
day
our
daily
bread
Luke
And
forgive
our
sins
for
ourselves
also
forgive
every
one
that
indebted
And
bring
not
into
temptation
Luke
And
said
unto
them
Which
you
shall
have
friend
and
shall
unto
him
midnight
and
say
him
Friend
lend
three
loaves
Luke
for
friend
mine
come
from
journey
and
have
nothing
set
before
him
Luke
and
from
within
shall
answer
and
say
Trouble
not
the
door
now
shut
and
children
are
with
bed
cannot
rise
and
give
thee
Luke
say
unto
you
Though
will
not
rise
and
give
him
because
his
friend
yet
because
his
importunity
will
arise
and
give
him
many
needeth
Luke
And
say
unto
you
Ask
and
shall
given
you
seek
and
shall
find
knock
and
shall
opened
unto
you
Luke
For
every
one
that
asketh
receiveth
and
that
seeketh
findeth
and
him
that
knocketh
shall
opened
Luke
And
which
you
that
father
shall
his
son
ask
loaf
and
give
him
stone
fish
and
for
fish
give
him
serpent
Luke
shall
ask
egg
will
give
him
scorpion
Luke
then
being
evil
know
how
give
good
gifts
unto
your
children
how
much
more
shall
your
heavenly
Father
give
the
Holy
Spirit
them
that
ask
him
Luke
And
was
casting
out
demon
that
was
dumb
And
came
pass
when
the
demon
was
gone
out
the
dumb
man
spake
and
the
multitudes
marvelled
Luke
But
some
them
said
Beelzebub
the
prince
the
demons
casteth
out
demons
Luke
And
others
trying
him
sought
him
sign
from
heaven
Luke
But
knowing
their
thoughts
said
unto
them
Every
kingdom
divided
against
itself
brought
desolation
and
house
divided
against
house
falleth
Luke
And
Satan
also
divided
against
himself
how
shall
his
kingdom
stand
because
say
that
cast
out
demons
Beelzebub
Luke
And
Beelzebub
cast
out
demons
whom
your
sons
cast
them
out
therefore
shall
they
your
judges
Luke
But
the
finger
God
cast
out
demons
then
the
kingdom
God
come
upon
you
Luke
When
the
strong
man
fully
armed
guardeth
his
own
court
his
goods
are
peace
Luke
but
when
stronger
than
shall
come
upon
him
and
overcome
him
taketh
from
him
his
whole
armor
wherein
trusted
and
divideth
his
spoils
Luke
that
not
with
against
and
that
gathereth
not
with
scattereth
Luke
The
unclean
spirit
when
gone
out
the
man
passeth
through
waterless
places
seeking
rest
and
finding
none
saith
will
turn
back
unto
house
whence
came
out
Luke
And
when
come
findeth
swept
and
garnished
Luke
Then
goeth
and
taketh
him
seven
other
spirits
more
evil
than
himself
and
they
enter
and
dwell
there
and
the
last
state
that
man
becometh
worse
than
the
first
Luke
And
came
pass
said
these
things
certain
woman
out
the
multitude
lifted
her
voice
and
said
unto
him
Blessed
the
womb
that
bare
thee
and
the
breasts
which
thou
didst
suck
Luke
But
said
Yea
rather
blessed
are
they
that
hear
the
word
God
and
keep
Luke
And
when
the
multitudes
were
gathering
together
unto
him
began
say
This
generation
evil
generation
seeketh
after
sign
and
there
shall
sign
given
but
the
sign
Jonah
Luke
For
even
Jonah
became
sign
unto
the
Ninevites
shall
also
the
Son
man
this
generation
Luke
The
queen
the
south
shall
rise
the
judgment
with
the
men
this
generation
and
shall
condemn
them
for
she
came
from
the
ends
the
earth
hear
the
wisdom
Solomon
and
behold
greater
than
Solomon
here
Luke
The
men
Nineveh
shall
stand
the
judgment
with
this
generation
and
shall
condemn
for
they
repented
the
preaching
Jonah
and
behold
greater
than
Jonah
here
Luke
man
when
hath
lighted
lamp
putteth
cellar
neither
under
the
bushel
but
the
stand
that
they
which
enter
may
see
the
light
Luke
The
lamp
thy
body
thine
eye
when
thine
eye
single
thy
whole
body
also
full
light
but
when
evil
thy
body
also
full
darkness
Luke
Look
therefore
whether
the
light
that
thee
not
darkness
Luke
therefore
thy
whole
body
full
light
having
part
dark
shall
wholly
full
light
when
the
lamp
with
its
bright
shining
doth
give
thee
light
Luke
Now
spake
Pharisee
asketh
him
dine
with
him
and
went
and
sat
down
meat
Luke
And
when
the
Pharisee
saw
marvelled
that
had
not
first
bathed
himself
before
dinner
Luke
And
the
Lord
said
unto
him
Now
the
Pharisees
cleanse
the
outside
the
cup
and
the
platter
but
your
inward
part
full
extortion
and
wickedness
Luke
foolish
ones
did
not
that
made
the
outside
make
the
inside
also
Luke
But
give
for
alms
those
things
which
are
within
and
behold
all
things
are
clean
unto
you
Luke
But
woe
unto
you
Pharisees
for
tithe
mint
and
rue
and
every
herb
and
pass
over
justice
and
the
love
God
but
these
ought
have
done
and
not
leave
the
other
undone
Luke
Woe
unto
you
Pharisees
for
love
the
chief
seats
the
synagogues
and
the
salutations
the
marketplaces
Luke
Woe
unto
you
for
are
the
tombs
which
appear
not
and
the
men
that
walk
over
them
know
not
Luke
And
one
the
lawyers
answering
saith
unto
him
Teacher
saying
this
thou
reproachest
also
Luke
And
said
Woe
unto
you
lawyers
also
for
load
men
with
burdens
grievous
borne
and
yourselves
touch
not
the
burdens
with
one
your
fingers
Luke
Woe
unto
you
for
build
the
tombs
the
prophets
and
your
fathers
killed
them
Luke
are
witnesses
and
consent
unto
the
works
your
fathers
for
they
killed
them
and
build
their
tombs
Luke
Therefore
also
said
the
wisdom
God
will
send
unto
them
prophets
and
apostles
and
some
them
they
shall
kill
and
persecute
Luke
that
the
blood
all
the
prophets
which
was
shed
from
the
foundation
the
world
may
required
this
generation
Luke
from
the
blood
Abel
unto
the
blood
Zachariah
who
perished
between
the
altar
and
the
sanctuary
yea
say
unto
you
shall
required
this
generation
Luke
Woe
unto
you
lawyers
for
took
away
the
key
knowledge
entered
not
yourselves
and
them
that
were
entering
hindered
Luke
And
when
was
come
out
from
thence
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
began
press
upon
him
vehemently
and
provoke
him
speak
many
things
Luke
laying
wait
for
him
catch
something
out
his
mouth
Luke
the
mean
time
when
the
many
thousands
the
multitude
were
gathered
together
insomuch
that
they
trod
one
upon
another
began
say
unto
his
disciples
first
all
Beware
the
leaven
the
Pharisees
which
hypocrisy
Luke
But
there
nothing
covered
that
shall
not
revealed
and
hid
that
shall
not
known
Luke
Wherefore
whatsoever
have
said
the
darkness
shall
heard
the
light
and
what
have
spoken
the
ear
the
inner
chambers
shall
proclaimed
upon
the
housetops
Luke
And
say
unto
you
friends
not
afraid
them
that
kill
the
body
and
after
that
have
more
that
they
can
Luke
But
will
warn
you
whom
shall
fear
Fear
him
who
after
hath
killed
hath
power
cast
into
hell
yea
say
unto
you
Fear
him
Luke
Are
not
five
sparrows
sold
for
two
pence
and
not
one
them
forgotten
the
sight
God
Luke
But
the
very
hairs
your
head
are
all
numbered
Fear
not
are
more
value
than
many
sparrows
Luke
And
say
unto
you
Every
one
who
shall
confess
before
men
him
shall
the
Son
man
also
confess
before
the
angels
God
Luke
but
that
denieth
the
presence
men
shall
denied
the
presence
the
angels
God
Luke
And
every
one
who
shall
speak
word
against
the
Son
man
shall
forgiven
him
but
unto
him
that
blasphemeth
against
the
Holy
Spirit
shall
not
forgiven
Luke
And
when
they
bring
you
before
the
synagogues
and
the
rulers
and
the
authorities
not
anxious
how
what
shall
answer
what
shall
say
Luke
for
the
Holy
Spirit
shall
teach
you
that
very
hour
what
ought
say
Luke
And
one
out
the
multitude
said
unto
him
Teacher
bid
brother
divide
the
inheritance
with
Luke
But
said
unto
him
Man
who
made
judge
divider
over
you
Luke
And
said
unto
them
Take
heed
and
keep
yourselves
from
all
covetousness
for
man
life
consisteth
not
the
abundance
the
things
which
possesseth
Luke
And
spake
parable
unto
them
saying
The
ground
certain
rich
man
brought
forth
plentifully
Luke
and
reasoned
within
himself
saying
What
shall
because
have
not
where
bestow
fruits
Luke
And
said
This
will
will
pull
down
barns
and
build
greater
and
there
will
bestow
all
grain
and
goods
Luke
And
will
say
soul
Soul
thou
hast
much
goods
laid
for
many
years
take
thine
ease
eat
drink
merry
Luke
But
God
said
unto
him
Thou
foolish
one
this
night
thy
soul
required
thee
and
the
things
which
thou
hast
prepared
whose
shall
they
Luke
that
layeth
treasure
for
himself
and
not
rich
toward
God
Luke
And
said
unto
his
disciples
Therefore
say
unto
you
not
anxious
for
your
life
what
shall
eat
nor
yet
for
your
body
what
shall
put
Luke
For
the
life
more
than
the
food
and
the
body
than
the
raiment
Luke
Consider
the
ravens
that
they
sow
not
neither
reap
which
have
store
chamber
nor
barn
and
God
feedeth
them
how
much
more
value
are
than
the
birds
Luke
And
which
you
being
anxious
can
add
cubit
unto
the
measure
his
life
Luke
then
are
not
able
even
that
which
least
why
are
anxious
concerning
the
rest
Luke
Consider
the
lilies
how
they
grow
they
toil
not
neither
they
spin
yet
say
unto
you
Even
Solomon
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
these
Luke
But
God
doth
clothe
the
grass
the
field
which
day
and
tomorrow
cast
into
the
oven
how
much
more
shall
clothe
you
little
faith
Luke
And
seek
not
what
shall
eat
and
what
shall
drink
neither
doubtful
mind
Luke
For
all
these
things
the
nations
the
world
seek
after
but
your
Father
knoweth
that
have
need
these
things
Luke
Yet
seek
his
kingdom
and
these
things
shall
added
unto
you
Luke
Fear
not
little
flock
for
your
Father
good
pleasure
give
you
the
kingdom
Luke
Sell
that
which
have
and
give
alms
make
for
yourselves
purses
which
wax
not
old
treasure
the
heavens
that
faileth
not
where
thief
draweth
near
neither
moth
destroyeth
Luke
For
where
your
treasure
there
will
your
heart
also
Luke
Let
your
loins
girded
about
and
your
lamps
burning
Luke
and
yourselves
like
unto
men
looking
for
their
lord
when
shall
return
from
the
marriage
feast
that
when
cometh
and
knocketh
they
may
straightway
open
unto
him
Luke
Blessed
are
those
servants
whom
the
lord
when
cometh
shall
find
watching
verily
say
unto
you
that
shall
gird
himself
and
make
them
sit
down
meat
and
shall
come
and
serve
them
Luke
And
shall
come
the
second
watch
and
the
third
and
find
them
blessed
are
those
servants
Luke
But
know
this
that
the
master
the
house
had
known
what
hour
the
thief
was
coming
would
have
watched
and
not
have
left
his
house
broken
through
Luke
also
ready
for
hour
that
think
not
the
Son
man
cometh
Luke
And
Peter
said
Lord
speakest
thou
this
parable
unto
even
unto
all
Luke
And
the
Lord
said
Who
then
the
faithful
and
wise
steward
whom
his
lord
shall
set
over
his
household
give
them
their
portion
food
due
season
Luke
Blessed
that
servant
whom
his
lord
when
cometh
shall
find
doing
Luke
truth
say
unto
you
that
will
set
him
over
all
that
hath
Luke
But
that
servant
shall
say
his
heart
lord
delayeth
his
coming
and
shall
begin
beat
the
menservants
and
the
maidservants
and
eat
and
drink
and
drunken
Luke
the
lord
that
servant
shall
come
day
when
expecteth
not
and
hour
when
knoweth
not
and
shall
cut
him
asunder
and
appoint
his
portion
with
the
unfaithful
Luke
And
that
servant
who
knew
his
lord
will
and
made
not
ready
nor
did
according
his
will
shall
beaten
with
many
stripes
Luke
but
that
knew
not
and
did
things
worthy
stripes
shall
beaten
with
few
stripes
And
whomsoever
much
given
him
shall
much
required
and
whom
they
commit
much
him
will
they
ask
the
more
Luke
came
cast
fire
upon
the
earth
and
what
desire
already
kindled
Luke
But
have
baptism
baptized
with
and
how
straitened
till
accomplished
Luke
Think
that
come
give
peace
the
earth
tell
you
Nay
but
rather
division
Luke
for
there
shall
from
henceforth
five
one
house
divided
three
against
two
and
two
against
three
Luke
They
shall
divided
father
against
son
and
son
against
father
mother
against
daughter
and
daughter
against
her
mother
mother
law
against
her
daughter
law
and
daughter
law
against
her
mother
law
Luke
And
said
the
multitudes
also
When
see
cloud
rising
the
west
straightway
say
There
cometh
shower
and
cometh
pass
Luke
And
when
see
south
wind
blowing
say
There
will
scorching
heat
and
cometh
pass
Luke
hypocrites
know
how
interpret
the
face
the
earth
and
the
heaven
but
how
that
know
not
how
interpret
this
time
Luke
And
why
even
yourselves
judge
not
what
right
Luke
For
thou
art
going
with
thine
adversary
before
the
magistrate
the
way
give
diligence
quit
him
lest
haply
drag
thee
unto
the
judge
and
the
judge
shall
deliver
thee
the
officer
and
the
officer
shall
cast
thee
into
prison
Luke
say
unto
thee
Thou
shalt
means
come
out
thence
till
thou
have
paid
the
very
last
mite
Luke
Now
there
were
some
present
that
very
season
who
told
him
the
Galilæans
whose
blood
Pilate
had
mingled
with
their
sacrifices
Luke
And
answered
and
said
unto
them
Think
that
these
Galilæans
were
sinners
above
all
the
Galilæans
because
they
have
suffered
these
things
Luke
tell
you
Nay
but
except
repent
shall
all
like
manner
perish
Luke
those
eighteen
upon
whom
the
tower
Siloam
fell
and
killed
them
think
that
they
were
offenders
above
all
the
men
that
dwell
Jerusalem
Luke
tell
you
Nay
but
except
repent
shall
all
likewise
perish
Luke
And
spake
this
parable
certain
man
had
fig
tree
planted
his
vineyard
and
came
seeking
fruit
thereon
and
found
none
Luke
And
said
unto
the
vinedresser
Behold
these
three
years
come
seeking
fruit
this
fig
tree
and
find
none
cut
down
why
doth
also
cumber
the
ground
Luke
And
answering
saith
unto
him
Lord
let
alone
this
year
also
till
shall
dig
about
and
dung
Luke
and
bear
fruit
thenceforth
well
but
not
thou
shalt
cut
down
Luke
And
was
teaching
one
the
synagogues
the
sabbath
day
Luke
And
behold
woman
that
had
spirit
infirmity
eighteen
years
and
she
was
bowed
together
and
could
wise
lift
herself
Luke
And
when
Jesus
saw
her
called
her
and
said
her
Woman
thou
art
loosed
from
thine
infirmity
Luke
And
laid
his
hands
upon
her
and
immediately
she
was
made
straight
and
glorified
God
Luke
And
the
ruler
the
synagogue
being
moved
with
indignation
because
Jesus
had
healed
the
sabbath
answered
and
said
the
multitude
There
are
six
days
which
men
ought
work
them
therefore
come
and
healed
and
not
the
day
the
sabbath
Luke
But
the
Lord
answered
him
and
said
hypocrites
doth
not
each
one
you
the
sabbath
loose
his
his
ass
from
the
stall
and
lead
him
away
watering
Luke
And
ought
not
this
woman
being
daughter
Abraham
whom
Satan
had
bound
these
eighteen
years
have
been
loosed
from
this
bond
the
day
the
sabbath
Luke
And
said
these
things
all
his
adversaries
were
put
shame
and
all
the
multitude
rejoiced
for
all
the
glorious
things
that
were
done
him
Luke
said
therefore
Unto
what
the
kingdom
God
like
and
whereunto
shall
liken
Luke
like
unto
grain
mustard
seed
which
man
took
and
cast
into
his
own
garden
and
grew
and
became
tree
and
the
birds

heaven
lodged
the
branches
thereof
Luke
And
again
said
Whereunto
shall
liken
the
kingdom
God
Luke
like
unto
leaven
which
woman
took
and
hid
three
measures
meal
till
was
all
leavened
Luke
And
went
his
way
through
cities
and
villages
teaching
and
journeying
unto
Jerusalem
Luke
And
one
said
unto
him
Lord
are
they
few
that
are
saved
And
said
unto
them
Luke
Strive
enter
the
narrow
door
for
many
say
unto
you
shall
seek
enter
and
shall
not
able
Luke
When
once
the
master
the
house
risen
and
hath
shut
the
door
and
begin
stand
without
and
knock
the
door
saying
Lord
open
and
shall
answer
and
say
you
know
you
not
whence
are
Luke
then
shall
begin
say
did
eat
and
drink
thy
presence
and
thou
didst
teach
our
streets
Luke
and
shall
say
tell
you
know
not
whence
are
depart
from
all
workers
iniquity
Luke
There
shall
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
teeth
when
shall
see
Abraham
and
Isaac
and
Jacob
and
all
the
prophets
the
kingdom
God
and
yourselves
cast
forth
without
Luke
And
they
shall
come
from
the
east
and
west
and
from
the
north
and
south
and
shall
sit
down
the
kingdom
God
Luke
And
behold
there
are
last
who
shall
first
and
there
are
first
who
shall
last
Luke
that
very
hour
there
came
certain
Pharisees
saying
him
Get
thee
out
and
hence
for
Herod
would
fain
kill
thee
Luke
And
said
unto
them
and
say
that
fox
Behold
cast
out
demons
and
perform
cures
day
and
morrow
and
the
third
day
perfected
Luke
Nevertheless
must
way
day
and
morrow
and
the
day
following
for
cannot
that
prophet
perish
out
Jerusalem
Luke
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
that
killeth
the
prophets
and
stoneth
them
that
are
sent
unto
her
how
often
would
have
gathered
thy
children
together
even
hen
gathereth
her
own
brood
under
her
wings
and
would
not
Luke
Behold
your
house
left
unto
you
desolate
and
say
unto
you
shall
not
see
until
shall
say
Blessed
that
cometh
the
name
the
Lord
Luke
And
came
pass
when
went
into
the
house
one
the
rulers
the
Pharisees
sabbath
eat
bread
that
they
were
watching
him
Luke
And
behold
there
was
before
him
certain
man
that
had
the
dropsy
Luke
And
Jesus
answering
spake
unto
the
lawyers
and
Pharisees
saying
lawful
heal
the
sabbath
not
Luke
But
they
held
their
peace
And
took
him
and
healed
him
and
let
him
Luke
And
said
unto
them
Which
you
shall
have
ass
fallen
into
well
and
will
not
straightway
draw
him
sabbath
day
Luke
And
they
could
not
answer
again
unto
these
things
Luke
And
spake
parable
unto
those
that
were
bidden
when
marked
how
they
chose
out
the
chief
seats
saying
unto
them
Luke
When
thou
art
bidden
any
man
marriage
feast
sit
not
down
the
chief
seat
lest
haply
more
honorable
man
than
thou
bidden
him
Luke
and
that
bade
thee
and
him
shall
come
and
say
thee
Give
this
man
place
and
then
thou
shalt
begin
with
shame
take
the
lowest
place
Luke
But
when
thou
art
bidden
and
sit
down
the
lowest
place
that
when
that
hath
bidden
thee
cometh
may
say
thee
Friend
higher
then
shalt
thou
have
glory
the
presence
all
that
sit
meat
with
thee
Luke
For
every
one
that
exalteth
himself
shall
humbled
and
that
humbleth
himself
shall
exalted
Luke
And
said
him
also
that
had
bidden
him
When
thou
makest
dinner
supper
call
not
thy
friends
nor
thy
brethren
nor
thy
kinsmen
nor
rich
neighbors
lest
haply
they
also
bid
thee
again
and
recompense
made
thee
Luke
But
when
thou
makest
feast
bid
the
poor
the
maimed
the
lame
the
blind
Luke
and
thou
shalt
blessed
because
they
have
not
wherewith
recompense
thee
for
thou
shalt
recompensed
the
resurrection
the
just
Luke
And
when
one
them
that
sat
meat
with
him
heard
these
things
said
unto
him
Blessed
that
shall
eat
bread
the
kingdom
God
Luke
But
said
unto
him
certain
man
made
great
supper
and
bade
many
Luke
and
sent
forth
his
servant
supper
time
say
them
that
were
bidden
Come
for
all
things
are
now
ready
Luke
And
they
all
with
one
consent
began
make
excuse
The
first
said
unto
him
have
bought
field
and
must
needs
out
and
see
pray
thee
have
excused
Luke
And
another
said
have
bought
five
yoke
oxen
and
prove
them
pray
thee
have
excused
Luke
And
another
said
have
married
wife
and
therefore
cannot
come
Luke
And
the
servant
came
and
told
his
lord
these
things
Then
the
master
the
house
being
angry
said
his
servant
out
quickly
into
the
streets
and
lanes
the
city
and
bring
hither
the
poor
and
maimed
and
blind
and
lame
Luke
And
the
servant
said
Lord
what
thou
didst
command
done
and
yet
there
room
Luke
And
the
lord
said
unto
the
servant
out
into
the
highways
and
hedges
and
constrain
them
come
that
house
may
filled
Luke
For
say
unto
you
that
none
those
men
that
were
bidden
shall
taste
supper
Luke
Now
there
went
with
him
great
multitudes
and
turned
and
said
unto
them
Luke
any
man
cometh
unto
and
hateth
not
his
own
father
and
mother
and
wife
and
children
and
brethren
and
sisters
yea
and
his
own
life
also
cannot
disciple
Luke
Whosoever
doth
not
bear
his
own
cross
and
come
after
cannot
disciple
Luke
For
which
you
desiring
build
tower
doth
not
first
sit
down
and
count
the
cost
whether
have
wherewith
complete
Luke
Lest
haply
when
hath
laid
foundation
and
not
able
finish
all
that
behold
begin
mock
him
Luke
saying
This
man
began
build
and
was
not
able
finish
Luke
what
king
goeth
encounter
another
king
war
will
not
sit
down
first
and
take
counsel
whether
able
with
ten
thousand
meet
him
that
cometh
against
him
with
twenty
thousand
Luke
else
while
the
other
yet
great
way
off
sendeth
ambassage
and
asketh
conditions
peace
Luke
therefore
whosoever
you
that
renounceth
not
all
that
hath
cannot
disciple
Luke
Salt
therefore
good
but
even
the
salt
have
lost
its
savor
wherewith
shall
seasoned
Luke
fit
neither
for
the
land
nor
for
the
dunghill
men
cast
out
that
hath
ears
hear
let
him
hear
Luke
Now
all
the
publicans
and
sinners
were
drawing
near
unto
him
hear
him
Luke
And
both
the
Pharisees
and
the
scribes
murmured
saying
This
man
receiveth
sinners
and
eateth
with
them
Luke
And
spake
unto
them
this
parable
saying
Luke
What
man
you
having
hundred
sheep
and
having
lost
one
them
doth
not
leave
the
ninety
and
nine
the
wilderness
and
after
that
which
lost
until
find
Luke
And
when
hath
found
layeth
his
shoulders
rejoicing
Luke
And
when
cometh
home
calleth
together
his
friends
and
his
neighbors
saying
unto
them
Rejoice
with
for
have
found
sheep
which
was
lost
Luke
say
unto
you
that
even
there
shall
joy
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
more
than
over
ninety
and
nine
righteous
persons
who
need
repentance
Luke
what
woman
having
ten
pieces
silver
she
lose
one
piece
doth
not
light
lamp
and
sweep
the
house
and
seek
diligently
until
she
find
Luke
And
when
she
hath
found
she
calleth
together
her
friends
and
neighbors
saying
Rejoice
with
for
have
found
the
piece
which
had
lost
Luke
Even
say
unto
you
there
joy
the
presence
the
angels
God
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
Luke
And
said
certain
man
had
two
sons
Luke
and
the
younger
them
said
his
father
Father
give
the
portion
thy
substance
that
falleth
And
divided
unto
them
his
living
Luke
And
not
many
days
after
the
younger
son
gathered
all
together
and
took
his
journey
into
far
country
and
there
wasted
his
substance
with
riotous
living
Luke
And
when
had
spent
all
there
arose
mighty
famine
that
country
and
began
want
Luke
And
went
and
joined
himself
one
the
citizens
that
country
and
sent
him
into
his
fields
feed
swine
Luke
And
would
fain
have
filled
his
belly
with
the
husks
that
the
swine
did
eat
and
man
gave
unto
him
Luke
But
when
came
himself
said
How
many
hired
servants
father
have
bread
enough
and
spare
and
perish
here
with
hunger
Luke
will
arise
and
father
and
will
say
unto
him
Father
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
thy
sight
Luke
more
worthy
called
thy
son
make
one
thy
hired
servants
Luke
And
arose
and
came
his
father
But
while
was
yet
afar
off
his
father
saw
him
and
was
moved
with
compassion
and
ran
and
fell
his
neck
and
kissed
him
Luke
And
the
son
said
unto
him
Father
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
thy
sight
more
worthy
called
thy
son
Luke
But
the
father
said
his
servants
Bring
forth
quickly
the
best
robe
and
put
him
and
put
ring
his
hand
and
shoes
his
feet
Luke
and
bring
the
fatted
calf
and
kill
and
let
eat
and
make
merry
Luke
for
this
son
was
dead
and
alive
again
was
lost
and
found
And
they
began
merry
Luke
Now
his
elder
son
was
the
field
and
came
and
drew
nigh
the
house
heard
music
and
dancing
Luke
And
called
him
one
the
servants
and
inquired
what
these
things
might
Luke
And
said
unto
him
Thy
brother
come
and
thy
father
hath
killed
the
fatted
calf
because
hath
received
him
safe
and
sound
Luke
But
was
angry
and
would
not
and
his
father
came
out
and
entreated
him
Luke
But
answered
and
said
his
father
these
many
years
serve
thee
and
never
transgressed
commandment
thine
and
yet
thou
never
gavest
kid
that
might
make
merry
with
friends
Luke
but
when
this
thy
son
came
who
hath
devoured
thy
living
with
harlots
thou
killedst
for
him
the
fatted
calf
Luke
And
said
unto
him
Son
thou
art
ever
with
and
all
that
mine
thine
Luke
But
was
meet
make
merry
and
glad
for
this
thy
brother
was
dead
and
alive
again
and
was
lost
and
found
Luke
And
said
also
unto
the
disciples
There
was
certain
rich
man
who
had
steward
and
the
same
was
accused
unto
him
that
was
wasting
his
goods
Luke
And
called
him
and
said
unto
him
What
this
that
hear
thee
render
the
account
thy
stewardship
for
thou
canst
longer
steward
Luke
And
the
steward
said
within
himself
What
shall
seeing
that
lord
taketh
away
the
stewardship
from
have
not
strength
dig
beg
ashamed
Luke
resolved
what
that
when
put
out
the
stewardship
they
may
receive
into
their
houses
Luke
And
calling
him
each
one
his
lord
debtors
said
the
first
How
much
owest
thou
unto
lord
Luke
And
said
hundred
measures
oil
And
said
unto
him
Take
thy
bond
and
sit
down
quickly
and
write
fifty
Luke
Then
said
another
And
how
much
owest
thou
And
said
hundred
measures
wheat
saith
unto
him
Take
thy
bond
and
write
fourscore
Luke
And
his
lord
commended
the
unrighteous
steward
because
had
done
wisely
for
the
sons
this
world
are
for
their
own
generation
wiser
than
the
sons
the
light
Luke
And
say
unto
you
Make
yourselves
friends
means
the
mammon
unrighteousness
that
when
shall
fail
they
may
receive
you
into
the
eternal
tabernacles
Luke
that
faithful
very
little
faithful
also
much
and
that
unrighteous
very
little
unrighteous
also
much
Luke
therefore
have
not
been
faithful
the
unrighteous
mammon
who
will
commit
your
trust
the
true
riches
Luke
And
have
not
been
faithful
that
which
another
who
will
give
you
that
which
your
own
Luke
servant
can
serve
two
masters
for
either
will
hate
the
one
and
love
the
other
else
will
hold
one
and
despise
the
other
cannot
serve
God
and
mammon
Luke
And
the
Pharisees
who
were
lovers
money
heard
all
these
things
and
they
scoffed
him
Luke
And
said
unto
them
are
they
that
justify
yourselves
the
sight
men
but
God
knoweth
your
hearts
for
that
which
exalted
among
men
abomination
the
sight
God
Luke
The
law
and
the
prophets
were
until
John
from
that
time
the
gospel
the
kingdom
God
preached
and
every
man
entereth
violently
into
Luke
But
easier
for
heaven
and
earth
pass
away
than
for
one
tittle
the
law
fall
Luke
Every
one
that
putteth
away
his
wife
and
marrieth
another
committeth
adultery
and
that
marrieth
one
that
put
away
from
husband
committeth
adultery
Luke
Now
there
was
certain
rich
man
and
was
clothed
purple
and
fine
linen
faring
sumptuously
every
day
Luke
and
certain
beggar
named
Lazarus
was
laid
his
gate
full
sores
Luke
and
desiring
fed
with
the
crumbs
that
fell
from
the
rich
man
table
yea
even
the
dogs
came
and
licked
his
sores
Luke
And
came
pass
that
the
beggar
died
and
that
was
carried
away
the
angels
into
Abraham
bosom
and
the
rich
man
also
died
and
was
buried
Luke
And
Hades
lifted
his
eyes
being
torments
and
seeth
Abraham
afar
off
and
Lazarus
his
bosom
Luke
And
cried
and
said
Father
Abraham
have
mercy
and
send
Lazarus
that
may
dip
the
tip
his
finger
water
and
cool
tongue
for
anguish
this
flame
Luke
But
Abraham
said
Son
remember
that
thou
thy
lifetime
receivedst
thy
good
things
and
Lazarus
like
manner
evil
things
but
now
here
comforted
and
thou
art
anguish
Luke
And
besides
all
this
between
and
you
there
great
gulf
fixed
that
they
that
would
pass
from
hence
you
may
not
able
and
that
none
may
cross
over
from
thence
Luke
And
said
pray
thee
therefore
father
that
thou
wouldest
send
him
father
house
Luke
for
have
five
brethren
that
may
testify
unto
them
lest
they
also
come
into
this
place
torment
Luke
But
Abraham
saith
They
have
Moses
and
the
prophets
let
them
hear
them
Luke
And
said
Nay
father
Abraham
but
one
them
from
the
dead
they
will
repent
Luke
And
said
unto
him
they
hear
not
Moses
and
the
prophets
neither
will
they
persuaded
one
rise
from
the
dead
Luke
And
said
unto
his
disciples
impossible
but
that
occasions
stumbling
should
come
but
woe
unto
him
through
whom
they
come
Luke
were
well
for
him
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
neck
and
were
thrown
into
the
sea
rather
than
that
should
cause
one
these
little
ones
stumble
Luke
Take
heed
yourselves
thy
brother
sin
rebuke
him
and
repent
forgive
him
Luke
And
sin
against
thee
seven
times
the
day
and
seven
times
turn
again
thee
saying
repent
thou
shalt
forgive
him
Luke
And
the
apostles
said
unto
the
Lord
Increase
our
faith
Luke
And
the
Lord
said
had
faith
grain
mustard
seed
would
say
unto
this
sycamine
tree
thou
rooted
and
thou
planted
the
sea
and
would
obey
you
Luke
But
who
there
you
having
servant
plowing
keeping
sheep
that
will
say
unto
him
when
come
from
the
field
Come
straightway
and
sit
down
meat
Luke
and
will
not
rather
say
unto
him
Make
ready
wherewith
may
sup
and
gird
thyself
and
serve
till
have
eaten
and
drunken
and
afterward
thou
shalt
eat
and
drink
Luke
Doth
thank
the
servant
because
did
the
things
that
were
commanded
Luke
Even
also
when
shall
have
done
all
the
things
that
are
commanded
you
say
are
unprofitable
servants
have
done
that
which
was
our
duty
Luke
And
came
pass
they
were
the
way
Jerusalem
that
was
passing
along
the
borders
Samaria
and
Galilee
Luke
And
entered
into
certain
village
there
met
him
ten
men
that
were
lepers
who
stood
afar
off
Luke
and
they
lifted
their
voices
saying
Jesus
Master
Have
mercy
Luke
And
when
saw
them
said
unto
them
and
show
yourselves
unto
the
priests
And
came
pass
they
went
they
were
cleansed
Luke
And
one
them
when
saw
that
was
healed
turned
back
with
loud
voice
glorifying
God
Luke
and
fell
upon
his
face
his
feet
giving
him
thanks
and
was
Samaritan
Luke
And
Jesus
answering
said
Were
not
the
ten
cleansed
but
where
are
the
nine
Luke
Were
there
none
found
that
returned
give
glory
God
save
this
stranger
Luke
And
said
unto
him
Arise
and
thy
way
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole
Luke
And
being
asked
the
Pharisees
when
the
kingdom
God
cometh
answered
them
and
said
The
kingdom
God
cometh
not
with
observation
Luke
neither
shall
they
say
here
There
for
the
kingdom
God
within
you
Luke
And
said
unto
the
disciples
The
days
will
come
when
shall
desire
see
one
the
days
the
Son
man
and
shall
not
see
Luke
And
they
shall
say
you
there
here
not
away
nor
follow
after
them
Luke
for
the
lightning
when
lighteneth
out
the
one
part
under
the
heaven
shineth
unto
the
other
part
under
heaven
shall
the
Son
man
his
day
Luke
But
first
must
suffer
many
things
and
rejected
this
generation
Luke
And
came
pass
the
days
Noah
even
shall
also
the
days
the
Son
man
Luke
They
ate
they
drank
they
married
they
were
given
marriage
until
the
day
that
Noah
entered
into
the
ark
and
the
flood
came
and
destroyed
them
all
Luke
Likewise
even
came
pass
the
days
Lot
they
ate
they
drank
they
bought
they
sold
they
planted
they
builded
Luke
but
the
day
that
Lot
went
out
from
Sodom
rained
fire
and
brimstone
from
heaven
and
destroyed
them
all
Luke
after
the
same
manner
shall
the
day
that
the
Son
man
revealed
Luke
that
day
that
shall
the
housetop
and
his
goods
the
house
let
him
not
down
take
them
away
and
let
him
that
the
field
likewise
not
return
back
Luke
Remember
Lot
wife
Luke
Whosoever
shall
seek
gain
his
life
shall
lose
but
whosoever
shall
lose
his
life
shall
preserve
Luke
say
unto
you
that
night
there
shall
two
men
one
bed
the
one
shall
taken
and
the
other
shall
left
Luke
There
shall
two
women
grinding
together
the
one
shall
taken
and
the
other
shall
left
Luke
Luke
And
they
answering
say
unto
him
Where
Lord
And
said
unto
them
Where
the
body
thither
will
the
eagles
also
gathered
together
Luke
And
spake
parable
unto
them
the
end
that
they
ought
always
pray
and
not
faint
Luke
saying
There
was
city
judge
who
feared
not
God
and
regarded
not
man
Luke
and
there
was
widow
that
city
and
she
came
oft
unto
him
saying
Avenge
mine
adversary
Luke
And
would
not
for
while
but
afterward
said
within
himself
Though
fear
not
God
nor
regard
man
Luke
yet
because
this
widow
troubleth
will
avenge
her
lest
she
wear
out
her
continual
coming
Luke
And
the
Lord
said
Hear
what
the
unrighteous
judge
saith
Luke
And
shall
not
God
avenge
his
elect
that
cry
him
day
and
night
and
yet
longsuffering
over
them
Luke
say
unto
you
that
will
avenge
them
speedily
Nevertheless
when
the
Son
man
cometh
shall
find
faith
the
earth
Luke
And
spake
also
this
parable
unto
certain
who
trusted
themselves
that
they
were
righteous
and
set
all
others
nought
Luke
Two
men
went
into
the
temple
pray
the
one
Pharisee
and
the
other
publican
Luke
The
Pharisee
stood
and
prayed
thus
with
himself
God
thank
thee
that
not
the
rest
men
extortioners
unjust
adulterers
even
this
publican
Luke
fast
twice
the
week
give
tithes
all
that
get
Luke
But
the
publican
standing
afar
off
would
not
lift
much
his
eyes
unto
heaven
but
smote
his
breast
saying
God
thou
merciful
sinner
Luke
say
unto
you
This
man
went
down
his
house
justified
rather
than
the
other
for
every
one
that
exalteth
himself
shall
humbled
but
that
humbleth
himself
shall
exalted
Luke
And
they
were
bringing
unto
him
also
their
babes
that
should
touch
them
but
when
the
disciples
saw
they
rebuked
them
Luke
But
Jesus
called
them
unto
him
saying
Suffer
the
little
children
come
unto
and
forbid
them
not
for
such
belongeth
the
kingdom
God
Luke
Verily
say
unto
you
Whosoever
shall
not
receive
the
kingdom
God
little
child
shall
wise
enter
therein
Luke
And
certain
ruler
asked
him
saying
Good
Teacher
what
shall
inherit
eternal
life
Luke
And
Jesus
said
unto
him
Why
callest
thou
good
none
good
save
one
even
God
Luke
Thou
knowest
the
commandments
not
commit
adultery
not
kill
not
steal
not
bear
false
witness
Honor
thy
father
and
mother
Luke
And
said
All
these
things
have
observed
from
youth
Luke
And
when
Jesus
heard
said
unto
him
One
thing
thou
lackest
yet
sell
all
that
thou
hast
and
distribute
unto
the
poor
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
heaven
and
come
follow
Luke
But
when
heard
these
things
became
exceeding
sorrowful
for
was
very
rich
Luke
And
Jesus
seeing
him
said
How
hardly
shall
they
that
have
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
God
Luke
For
easier
for
camel
enter
through
needle
eye
than
for
rich
man
enter
into
the
kingdom
God
Luke
And
they
that
heard
said
Then
who
can
saved
Luke
But
said
The
things
which
are
impossible
with
men
are
possible
with
God
Luke
And
Peter
said
have
left
our
own
and
followed
thee
Luke
And
said
unto
them
Verily
say
unto
you
There
man
that
hath
left
house
wife
brethren
parents
children
for
the
kingdom
God
sake
Luke
who
shall
not
receive
manifold
more
this
time
and
the
world
come
eternal
life
Luke
And
took
unto
him
the
twelve
and
said
unto
them
Behold
Jerusalem
and
all
the
things
that
are
written
through
the
prophets
shall
accomplished
unto
the
Son
man
Luke
For
shall
delivered
unto
the
Gentiles
and
shall
mocked
and
shamefully
treated
and
spit
upon
Luke
and
they
shall
scourge
and
kill
him
and
the
third
day
shall
rise
again
Luke
And
they
understood
none
these
things
and
this
saying
was
hid
from
them
and
they
perceived
not
the
things
that
were
said
Luke
And
came
pass
drew
nigh
unto
Jericho
certain
blind
man
sat
the
way
side
begging
Luke
and
hearing
multitude
going
inquired
what
this
meant
Luke
And
they
told
him
that
Jesus
Nazareth
passeth
Luke
And
cried
saying
Jesus
thou
son
David
have
mercy
Luke
And
they
that
went
before
rebuked
him
that
should
hold
his
peace
but
cried
out
the
more
great
deal
Thou
son
David
have
mercy
Luke
And
Jesus
stood
and
commanded
him
brought
unto
him
and
when
was
come
near
asked
him
Luke
What
wilt
thou
that
should
unto
thee
And
said
Lord
that
may
receive
sight
Luke
And
Jesus
said
unto
him
Receive
thy
sight
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole
Luke
And
immediately
received
his
sight
and
followed
him
glorifying
God
and
all
the
people
when
they
saw
gave
praise
unto
God
Luke
And
entered
and
was
passing
through
Jericho
Luke
And
behold
man
called
name
Zacchæus
and
was
chief
publican
and
was
rich
Luke
And
sought
see
Jesus
who
was
and
could
not
for
the
crowd
because
was
little
stature
Luke
And
ran
before
and
climbed
into
sycomore
tree
see
him
for
was
pass
that
way
Luke
And
when
Jesus
came
the
place
looked
and
said
unto
him
Zacchæus
make
haste
and
come
down
for
day
must
abide
thy
house
Luke
And
made
haste
and
came
down
and
received
him
joyfully
Luke
And
when
they
saw
they
all
murmured
saying
gone
lodge
with
man
that
sinner
Luke
And
Zacchæus
stood
and
said
unto
the
Lord
Behold
Lord
the
half
goods
give
the
poor
and
have
wrongfully
exacted
aught
any
man
restore
fourfold
Luke
And
Jesus
said
unto
him
day
salvation
come
this
house
forasmuch
also
son
Abraham
Luke
For
the
Son
man
came
seek
and
save
that
which
was
lost
Luke
And
they
heard
these
things
added
and
spake
parable
because
was
nigh
Jerusalem
and
because
they
supposed
that
the
kingdom
God
was
immediately
appear
Luke
said
therefore
certain
nobleman
went
into
far
country
receive
for
himself
kingdom
and
return
Luke
And
called
ten
servants
his
and
gave
them
ten
pounds
and
said
unto
them
Trade
herewith
till
come
Luke
But
his
citizens
hated
him
and
sent
ambassage
after
him
saying
will
not
that
this
man
reign
over
Luke
And
came
pass
when
was
come
back
again
having
received
the
kingdom
that
commanded
these
servants
unto
whom
had
given
the
money
called
him
that
might
know
what
they
had
gained
trading
Luke
And
the
first
came
before
him
saying
Lord
thy
pound
hath
made
ten
pounds
more
Luke
And
said
unto
him
Well
done
thou
good
servant
because
thou
wast
found
faithful
very
little
have
thou
authority
over
ten
cities
Luke
And
the
second
came
saying
Thy
pound
Lord
hath
made
five
pounds
Luke
And
said
unto
him
also
thou
also
over
five
cities
Luke
And
another
came
saying
Lord
behold
here
thy
pound
which
kept
laid
napkin
Luke
for
feared
thee
because
thou
art
austere
man
thou
takest
that
which
thou
layedst
not
down
and
reapest
that
which
thou
didst
not
sow
Luke
saith
unto
him
Out
thine
own
mouth
will
judge
thee
thou
wicked
servant
Thou
knewest
that
austere
man
taking
that
which
laid
not
down
and
reaping
that
which
did
not
sow
Luke
then
wherefore
gavest
thou
not
money
into
the
bank
and
coming
should
have
required
with
interest
Luke
And
said
unto
them
that
stood
Take
away
from
him
the
pound
and
give
unto
him
that
hath
the
ten
pounds
Luke
And
they
said
unto
him
Lord
hath
ten
pounds
Luke
say
unto
you
that
unto
every
one
that
hath
shall
given
but
from
him
that
hath
not
even
that
which
hath
shall
taken
away
from
him
Luke
But
these
mine
enemies
that
would
not
that
should
reign
over
them
bring
hither
and
slay
them
before
Luke
And
when
had
thus
spoken
went
before
going
Jerusalem
Luke
And
came
pass
when
drew
nigh
unto
Bethphage
and
Bethany
the
mount
that
called
Olivet
sent
two
the
disciples
Luke
saying
your
way
into
the
village
over
against
you
which
enter
shall
find
colt
tied
whereon
man
ever
yet
sat
loose
him
and
bring
him
Luke
And
any
one
ask
you
Why
loose
him
thus
shall
say
The
Lord
hath
need
him
Luke
And
they
that
were
sent
went
away
and
found
even
had
said
unto
them
Luke
And
they
were
loosing
the
colt
the
owners
thereof
said
unto
them
Why
loose
the
colt
Luke
And
they
said
The
Lord
hath
need
him
Luke
And
they
brought
him
Jesus
and
they
threw
their
garments
upon
the
colt
and
set
Jesus
thereon
Luke
And
went
they
spread
their
garments
the
way
Luke
And
was
now
drawing
nigh
even
the
descent
the
mount
Olives
the
whole
multitude
the
disciples
began
rejoice
and
praise
God
with
loud
voice
for
all
the
mighty
works
which
they
had
seen
Luke
saying
Blessed
the
King
that
cometh
the
name
the
Lord
peace
heaven
and
glory
the
highest
Luke
And
some
the
Pharisees
from
the
multitude
said
unto
him
Teacher
rebuke
thy
disciples
Luke
And
answered
and
said
tell
you
that
these
shall
hold
their
peace
the
stones
will
cry
out
Luke
And
when
drew
nigh
saw
the
city
and
wept
over
Luke
saying
thou
hadst
known
this
day
even
thou
the
things
which
belong
unto
peace
but
now
they
are
hid
from
thine
eyes
Luke
For
the
days
shall
come
upon
thee
when
thine
enemies
shall
cast
bank
about
thee
and
compass
thee
round
and
keep
thee
every
side
Luke
and
shall
dash
thee
the
ground
and
thy
children
within
thee
and
they
shall
not
leave
thee
one
stone
upon
another
because
thou
knewest
not
the
time
thy
visitation
Luke
And
entered
into
the
temple
and
began
cast
out
them
that
sold
Luke
saying
unto
them
written
And
house
shall
house
prayer
but
have
made
den
robbers
Luke
And
was
teaching
daily
the
temple
But
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
principal
men
the
people
sought
destroy
him
Luke
and
they
could
not
find
what
they
might
for
the
people
all
hung
upon
him
listening
Luke
And
came
pass
one
the
days
was
teaching
the
people
the
temple
and
preaching
the
gospel
there
came
upon
him
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
with
the
elders
Luke
and
they
spake
saying
unto
him
Tell
what
authority
doest
thou
these
things
who
that
gave
thee
this
authority
Luke
And
answered
and
said
unto
them
also
will
ask
you
question
and
tell
Luke
The
baptism
John
was
from
heaven
from
men
Luke
And
they
reasoned
with
themselves
saying
shall
say
From
heaven
will
say
Why
did
not
believe
him
Luke
But
shall
say
From
men
all
the
people
will
stone
for
they
are
persuaded
that
John
was
prophet
Luke
And
they
answered
that
they
knew
not
whence
was
Luke
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
Neither
tell
you
what
authority
these
things
Luke
And
began
speak
unto
the
people
this
parable
man
planted
vineyard
and
let
out
husbandmen
and
went
into
another
country
for
long
time
Luke
And
the
season
sent
unto
the
husbandmen
servant
that
they
should
give
him
the
fruit
the
vineyard
but
the
husbandmen
beat
him
and
sent
him
away
empty
Luke
And
sent
yet
another
servant
and
him
also
they
beat
and
handled
him
shamefully
and
sent
him
away
empty
Luke
And
sent
yet
third
and
him
also
they
wounded
and
cast
him
forth
Luke
And
the
lord
the
vineyard
said
What
shall
will
send
beloved
son
may
they
will
reverence
him
Luke
But
when
the
husbandmen
saw
him
they
reasoned
one
with
another
saying
This
the
heir
let
kill
him
that
the
inheritance
may
ours
Luke
And
they
cast
him
forth
out
the
vineyard
and
killed
him
What
therefore
will
the
lord
the
vineyard
unto
them
Luke
will
come
and
destroy
these
husbandmen
and
will
give
the
vineyard
unto
others
And
when
they
heard
they
said
God
forbid
Luke
But
looked
upon
them
and
said
What
then
this
that
written
The
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
The
same
was
made
the
head
the
corner
Luke
Every
one
that
falleth
that
stone
shall
broken
pieces
but
whomsoever
shall
fall
will
scatter
him
dust
Luke
And
the
scribes
and
the
chief
priests
sought
lay
hands
him
that
very
hour
and
they
feared
the
people
for
they
perceived
that
spake
this
parable
against
them
Luke
And
they
watched
him
and
sent
forth
spies
who
feigned
themselves
righteous
that
they
might
take
hold
his
speech
deliver
him
the
rule
and
the
authority
the
governor
Luke
And
they
asked
him
saying
Teacher
know
that
thou
sayest
and
teachest
rightly
and
acceptest
not
the
person
any
but
truth
teachest
the
way
God
Luke
lawful
for
give
tribute
unto
Cæsar
not
Luke
But
perceived
their
craftiness
and
said
unto
them
Luke
Show
denarius
Whose
image
and
superscription
hath
And
they
said
Cæsar
Luke
And
said
unto
them
Then
render
unto
Cæsar
the
things
that
are
Cæsar
and
unto
God
the
things
that
are
God
Luke
And
they
were
not
able
take
hold
the
saying
before
the
people
and
they
marvelled
his
answer
and
held
their
peace
Luke
And
there
came
him
certain
the
Sadducees
they
that
say
that
there
resurrection
Luke
and
they
asked
him
saying
Teacher
Moses
wrote
unto
that
man
brother
die
having
wife
and
childless
his
brother
should
take
the
wife
and
raise
seed
unto
his
brother
Luke
There
were
therefore
seven
brethren
and
the
first
took
wife
and
died
childless
Luke
and
the
second
Luke
and
the
third
took
her
and
likewise
the
seven
also
left
children
and
died
Luke
Afterward
the
woman
also
died
Luke
the
resurrection
therefore
whose
wife
them
shall
she
for
the
seven
had
her
wife
Luke
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
The
sons
this
world
marry
and
are
given
marriage
Luke
but
they
that
are
accounted
worthy
attain
that
world
and
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
neither
marry
nor
are
given
marriage
Luke
for
neither
can
they
die
any
more
for
they
are
equal
unto
the
angels
and
are
sons
God
being
sons
the
resurrection
Luke
But
that
the
dead
are
raised
even
Moses
showed
the
place
concerning
the
Bush
when
calleth
the
Lord
the
God
Abraham
and
the
God
Isaac
and
the
God
Jacob
Luke
Now
not
the
God
the
dead
but
the
living
for
all
live
unto
him
Luke
And
certain
the
scribes
answering
said
Teacher
thou
hast
well
said
Luke
For
they
durst
not
any
more
ask
him
any
question
Luke
And
said
unto
them
How
say
they
that
the
Christ
David
son
Luke
For
David
himself
saith
the
book
Psalms
The
Lord
said
unto
Lord
Sit
thou
right
hand
Luke
Till
make
thine
enemies
the
footstool
thy
feet
Luke
David
therefore
calleth
him
Lord
and
how
his
son
Luke
And
the
hearing
all
the
people
said
unto
his
disciples
Luke
Beware
the
scribes
who
desire
walk
long
robes
and
love
salutations
the
marketplaces
and
chief
seats
the
synagogues
and
chief
places
feasts
Luke
who
devour
widows
houses
and
for
pretence
make
long
prayers
these
shall
receive
greater
condemnation
Luke
And
looked
and
saw
the
rich
men
that
were
casting
their
gifts
into
the
treasury
Luke
And
saw
certain
poor
widow
casting
thither
two
mites
Luke
And
said
truth
say
unto
you
This
poor
widow
cast
more
than
they
all
Luke
for
all
these
did
their
superfluity
cast
unto
the
gifts
but
she
her
want
did
cast
all
the
living
that
she
had
Luke
And
some
spake
the
temple
how
was
adorned
with
goodly
stones
and
offerings
said
Luke
for
these
things
which
behold
the
days
will
come
which
there
shall
not
left
here
one
stone
upon
another
that
shall
not
thrown
down
Luke
And
they
asked
him
saying
Teacher
when
therefore
shall
these
things
and
what
shall
the
sign
when
these
things
are
about
come
pass
Luke
And
said
Take
heed
that
not
led
astray
for
many
shall
come
name
saying
and
The
time
hand
not
after
them
Luke
And
when
shall
hear
wars
and
tumults
not
terrified
for
these
things
must
needs
come
pass
first
but
the
end
not
immediately
Luke
Then
said
unto
them
Nation
shall
rise
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
Luke
and
there
shall
great
earthquakes
and
divers
places
famines
and
pestilences
and
there
shall
terrors
and
great
signs
from
heaven
Luke
But
before
all
these
things
they
shall
lay
their
hands
you
and
shall
persecute
you
delivering
you
the
synagogues
and
prisons
bringing
you
before
kings
and
governors
for
name
sake
Luke
shall
turn
out
unto
you
for
testimony
Luke
Settle
therefore
your
hearts
not
meditate
beforehand
how
answer
Luke
for
will
give
you
mouth
and
wisdom
which
all
your
adversaries
shall
not
able
withstand
gainsay
Luke
But
shall
delivered
even
parents
and
brethren
and
kinsfolk
and
friends
and
some
you
shall
they
cause
put
death
Luke
And
shall
hated
all
men
for
name
sake
Luke
And
not
hair
your
head
shall
perish
Luke
your
patience
shall
win
your
souls
Luke
But
when
see
Jerusalem
compassed
with
armies
then
know
that
her
desolation
hand
Luke
Then
let
them
that
are
Judæa
flee
unto
the
mountains
and
let
them
that
are
the
midst
her
depart
out
and
let
not
them
that
are
the
country
enter
therein
Luke
For
these
are
days
vengeance
that
all
things
which
are
written
may
fulfilled
Luke
Woe
unto
them
that
are
with
child
and
them
that
give
suck
those
days
for
there
shall
great
distress
upon
the
land
and
wrath
unto
this
people
Luke
And
they
shall
fall
the
edge
the
sword
and
shall
led
captive
into
all
the
nations
and
Jerusalem
shall
trodden
down
the
Gentiles
until
the
times
the
Gentiles
fulfilled
Luke
And
there
shall
signs
sun
and
moon
and
stars
and
upon
the
earth
distress
nations
perplexity
for
the
roaring
the
sea
and
the
billows
Luke
men
fainting
for
fear
and
for
expectation
the
things
which
are
coming
the
world
for
the
powers
the
heavens
shall
shaken
Luke
And
then
shall
they
see
the
Son
man
coming
cloud
with
power
and
great
glory
Luke
But
when
these
things
begin
come
pass
look
and
lift
your
heads
because
your
redemption
draweth
nigh
Luke
And
spake
them
parable
Behold
the
fig
tree
and
all
the
trees
Luke
when
they
now
shoot
forth
see
and
know
your
own
selves
that
the
summer
now
nigh
Luke
Even
also
when
see
these
things
coming
pass
know
that
the
kingdom
God
nigh
Luke
Verily
say
unto
you
This
generation
shall
not
pass
away
till
all
things
accomplished
Luke
Heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
away
but
words
shall
not
pass
away
Luke
But
take
heed
yourselves
lest
haply
your
hearts
overcharged
with
surfeiting
and
drunkenness
and
cares
this
life
and
that
day
come
you
suddenly
snare
Luke
for
shall
come
upon
all
them
that
dwell
the
face
all
the
earth
Luke
But
watch
every
season
making
supplication
that
may
prevail
escape
all
these
things
that
shall
come
pass
and
stand
before
the
Son
man
Luke
And
every
day
was
teaching
the
temple
and
every
night
went
out
and
lodged
the
mount
that
called
Olivet
Luke
And
all
the
people
came
early
the
morning
him
the
temple
hear
him
Luke
Now
the
feast
unleavened
bread
drew
nigh
which
called
the
Passover
Luke
And
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
sought
how
they
might
put
him
death
for
they
feared
the
people
Luke
And
Satan
entered
into
Judas
who
was
called
Iscariot
being
the
number
the
twelve
Luke
And
went
away
and
communed
with
the
chief
priests
and
captains
how
might
deliver
him
unto
them
Luke
And
they
were
glad
and
covenanted
give
him
money
Luke
And
consented
and
sought
opportunity
deliver
him
unto
them
the
absence
the
multitude
Luke
And
the
day
unleavened
bread
came
which
the
passover
must
sacrificed
Luke
And
sent
Peter
and
John
saying
and
make
ready
for
the
passover
that
may
eat
Luke
And
they
said
unto
him
Where
wilt
thou
that
make
ready
Luke
And
said
unto
them
Behold
when
are
entered
into
the
city
there
shall
meet
you
man
bearing
pitcher
water
follow
him
into
the
house
whereinto
goeth
Luke
And
shall
say
unto
the
master
the
house
The
Teacher
saith
unto
thee
Where
the
guestchamber
where
shall
eat
the
passover
with
disciples
Luke
And
will
show
you
large
upper
room
furnished
there
make
ready
Luke
And
they
went
and
found
had
said
unto
them
and
they
made
ready
the
passover
Luke
And
when
the
hour
was
come
sat
down
and
the
apostles
with
him
Luke
And
said
unto
them
With
desire
have
desired
eat
this
passover
with
you
before
suffer
Luke
for
say
unto
you
shall
not
eat
until
fulfilled
the
kingdom
God
Luke
And
received
cup
and
when
had
given
thanks
said
Take
this
and
divide
among
yourselves
Luke
for
say
unto
you
shall
not
drink
from
henceforth
the
fruit
the
vine
until
the
kingdom
God
shall
come
Luke
And
took
bread
and
when
had
given
thanks
brake
and
gave
them
saying
This
body
which
given
for
you
this
remembrance
Luke
And
the
cup
like
manner
after
supper
saying
This
cup
the
new
covenant
blood
even
that
which
poured
out
for
you
Luke
But
behold
the
hand
him
that
betrayeth
with
the
table
Luke
For
the
Son
man
indeed
goeth
hath
been
determined
but
woe
unto
that
man
through
whom
betrayed
Luke
And
they
began
question
among
themselves
which
them
was
that
should
this
thing
Luke
And
there
arose
also
contention
among
them
which
them
was
accounted
greatest
Luke
And
said
unto
them
The
kings
the
Gentiles
have
lordship
over
them
and
they
that
have
authority
over
them
are
called
Benefactors
Luke
But
shall
not
but
that
the
greater
among
you
let
him
become
the
younger
and
that
chief
that
doth
serve
Luke
For
which
greater
that
sitteth
meat
that
serveth
not
that
sitteth
meat
but
the
midst
you
that
serveth
Luke
But
are
they
that
have
continued
with
temptations
Luke
and
appoint
unto
you
kingdom
even
Father
appointed
unto
Luke
that
may
eat
and
drink
table
kingdom
and
shall
sit
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
Israel
Luke
Simon
Simon
behold
Satan
asked
have
you
that
might
sift
you
wheat
Luke
but
made
supplication
for
thee
that
thy
faith
fail
not
and
thou
when
once
thou
hast
turned
again
establish
thy
brethren
Luke
And
said
unto
him
Lord
with
thee
ready
both
prison
and
death
Luke
And
said
tell
thee
Peter
the
cock
shall
not
crow
this
day
until
thou
shalt
thrice
deny
that
thou
knowest
Luke
And
said
unto
them
When
sent
you
forth
without
purse
and
wallet
and
shoes
lacked
anything
And
they
said
Nothing
Luke
And
said
unto
them
But
now
that
hath
purse
let
him
take
and
likewise
wallet
and
that
hath
none
let
him
sell
his
cloak
and
buy
sword
Luke
For
say
unto
you
that
this
which
written
must
fulfilled
And
was
reckoned
with
transgressors
for
that
which
concerneth
hath
fulfilment
Luke
And
they
said
Lord
behold
here
are
two
swords
And
said
unto
them
enough
Luke
And
came
out
and
went
his
custom
was
unto
the
mount
Olives
and
the
disciples
also
followed
him
Luke
And
when
was
the
place
said
unto
them
Pray
that
enter
not
into
temptation
Luke
And
was
parted
from
them
about
stone
cast
and
kneeled
down
and
prayed
Luke
saying
Father
thou
willing
remove
this
cup
from
nevertheless
not
will
but
thine
done
Luke
And
there
appeared
unto
him
angel
from
heaven
strengthening
him
Luke
And
being
agony
prayed
more
earnestly
and
his
sweat
became
were
great
drops
blood
falling
down
upon
the
ground
Luke
And
when
rose
from
his
prayer
came
unto
the
disciples
and
found
them
sleeping
for
sorrow
Luke
and
said
unto
them
Why
sleep
rise
and
pray
that
enter
not
into
temptation
Luke
While
yet
spake
behold
multitude
and
that
was
called
Judas
one
the
twelve
went
before
them
and
drew
near
unto
Jesus
kiss
him
Luke
But
Jesus
said
unto
him
Judas
betrayest
thou
the
Son
man
with
kiss
Luke
And
when
they
that
were
about
him
saw
what
would
follow
they
said
Lord
shall
smite
with
the
sword
Luke
And
certain
one
them
smote
the
servant
the
high
priest
and
struck
off
his
right
ear
Luke
But
Jesus
answered
and
said
Suffer
them
thus
far
And
touched
his
ear
and
healed
him
Luke
And
Jesus
said
unto
the
chief
priests
and
captains
the
temple
and
elders
that
were
come
against
him
Are
come
out
against
robber
with
swords
and
staves
Luke
When
was
daily
with
you
the
temple
stretched
not
forth
your
hands
against
but
this
your
hour
and
the
power
darkness
Luke
And
they
seized
him
and
led
him
away
and
brought
him
into
the
high
priest
house
But
Peter
followed
afar
off
Luke
And
when
they
had
kindled
fire
the
midst
the
court
and
had
sat
down
together
Peter
sat
the
midst
them
Luke
And
certain
maid
seeing
him
sat
the
light
the
fire
and
looking
stedfastly
upon
him
said
This
man
also
was
with
him
Luke
But
denied
saying
Woman
know
him
not
Luke
And
after
little
while
another
saw
him
and
said
Thou
also
art
one
them
But
Peter
said
Man
not
Luke
And
after
the
space
about
one
hour
another
confidently
affirmed
saying
truth
this
man
also
was
with
him
for
Galilæan
Luke
But
Peter
said
Man
know
not
what
thou
sayest
And
immediately
while
yet
spake
the
cock
crew
Luke
And
the
Lord
turned
and
looked
upon
Peter
And
Peter
remembered
the
word
the
Lord
how
that
said
unto
him
Before
the
cock
crow
this
day
thou
shalt
deny
thrice
Luke
And
went
out
and
wept
bitterly
Luke
And
the
men
that
held
Jesus
mocked
him
and
beat
him
Luke
And
they
blindfolded
him
and
asked
him
saying
Prophesy
who
that
struck
thee
Luke
And
many
other
things
spake
they
against
him
reviling
him
Luke
And
soon
was
day
the
assembly
the
elders
the
people
was
gathered
together
both
chief
priests
and
scribes
and
they
led
him
away
into
their
council
saying
Luke
thou
art
the
Christ
tell
But
said
unto
them
tell
you
will
not
believe
Luke
and
ask
you
will
not
answer
Luke
But
from
henceforth
shall
the
Son
man
seated
the
right
hand
the
power
God
Luke
And
they
all
said
Art
thou
then
the
Son
God
And
said
unto
them
say
that
Luke
And
they
said
What
further
need
have
witness
for
ourselves
have
heard
from
his
own
mouth
Luke
And
the
whole
company
them
rose
and
brought
him
before
Pilate
Luke
And
they
began
accuse
him
saying
found
this
man
perverting
our
nation
and
forbidding
give
tribute
Cæsar
and
saying
that
himself
Christ
king
Luke
And
Pilate
asked
him
saying
Art
thou
the
King
the
Jews
And
answered
him
and
said
Thou
sayest
Luke
And
Pilate
said
unto
the
chief
priests
and
the
multitudes
find
fault
this
man
Luke
But
they
were
the
more
urgent
saying
stirreth
the
people
teaching
throughout
all
Judæa
and
beginning
from
Galilee
even
unto
this
place
Luke
But
when
Pilate
heard
asked
whether
the
man
were
Galilæan
Luke
And
when
knew
that
was
Herod
jurisdiction
sent
him
unto
Herod
who
himself
also
was
Jerusalem
these
days
Luke
Now
when
Herod
saw
Jesus
was
exceeding
glad
for
was
long
time
desirous
see
him
because
had
heard
concerning
him
and
hoped
see
some
miracle
done
him
Luke
And
questioned
him
many
words
but
answered
him
nothing
Luke
And
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
stood
vehemently
accusing
him
Luke
And
Herod
with
his
soldiers
set
him
nought
and
mocked
him
and
arraying
him
gorgeous
apparel
sent
him
back
Pilate
Luke
And
Herod
and
Pilate
became
friends
with
each
other
that
very
day
for
before
they
were
enmity
between
themselves
Luke
And
Pilate
called
together
the
chief
priests
and
the
rulers
and
the
people
Luke
and
said
unto
them
brought
unto
this
man
one
that
perverteth
the
people
and
behold
having
examined
him
before
you
found
fault
this
man
touching
those
things
whereof
accuse
him
Luke
nor
yet
Herod
for
sent
him
back
unto
and
behold
nothing
worthy
death
hath
been
done
him
Luke
will
therefore
chastise
him
and
release
him
Luke
Luke
But
they
cried
out
all
together
saying
Away
with
this
man
and
release
unto
Barabbas
Luke
one
who
for
certain
insurrection
made
the
city
and
for
murder
was
cast
into
prison
Luke
And
Pilate
spake
unto
them
again
desiring
release
Jesus
Luke
but
they
shouted
saying
Crucify
crucify
him
Luke
And
said
unto
them
the
third
time
Why
what
evil
hath
this
man
done
have
found
cause
death
him
will
therefore
chastise
him
and
release
him
Luke
But
they
were
urgent
with
loud
voices
asking
that
might
crucified
And
their
voices
prevailed
Luke
And
Pilate
gave
sentence
that
what
they
asked
for
should
done
Luke
And
released
him
that
for
insurrection
and
murder
had
been
cast
into
prison
whom
they
asked
for
but
Jesus
delivered
their
will
Luke
And
when
they
led
him
away
they
laid
hold
upon
one
Simon
Cyrene
coming
from
the
country
and
laid
him
the
cross
bear
after
Jesus
Luke
And
there
followed
him
great
multitude
the
people
and
women
who
bewailed
and
lamented
him
Luke
But
Jesus
turning
unto
them
said
Daughters
Jerusalem
weep
not
for
but
weep
for
yourselves
and
for
your
children
Luke
For
behold
the
days
are
coming
which
they
shall
say
Blessed
are
the
barren
and
the
wombs
that
never
bare
and
the
breasts
that
never
gave
suck
Luke
Then
shall
they
begin
say
the
mountains
Fall
and
the
hills
Cover
Luke
For
they
these
things
the
green
tree
what
shall
done
the
dry
Luke
And
there
were
also
two
others
malefactors
led
with
him
put
death
Luke
And
when
they
came
unto
the
place
which
called
The
skull
there
they
crucified
him
and
the
malefactors
one
the
right
hand
and
the
other
the
left
Luke
And
Jesus
said
Father
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
And
parting
his
garments
among
them
they
cast
lots
Luke
And
the
people
stood
beholding
And
the
rulers
also
scoffed
him
saying
saved
others
let
him
save
himself
this
the
Christ
God
his
chosen
Luke
And
the
soldiers
also
mocked
him
coming
him
offering
him
vinegar
Luke
and
saying
thou
art
the
King
the
Jews
save
thyself
Luke
And
there
was
also
superscription
over
him
THIS
THE
KING
THE
JEWS
Luke
And
one
the
malefactors
that
were
hanged
railed
him
saying
Art
not
thou
the
Christ
save
thyself
and
Luke
But
the
other
answered
and
rebuking
him
said
Dost
thou
not
even
fear
God
seeing
thou
art
the
same
condemnation
Luke
And
indeed
justly
for
receive
the
due
reward
our
deeds
but
this
man
hath
done
nothing
amiss
Luke
And
said
Jesus
remember
when
thou
comest
thy
kingdom
Luke
And
said
unto
him
Verily
say
unto
thee
day
shalt
thou
with
Paradise
Luke
And
was
now
about
the
sixth
hour
and
darkness
came
over
the
whole
land
until
the
ninth
hour
Luke
the
sun
light
failing
and
the
veil
the
temple
was
rent
the
midst
Luke
And
Jesus
crying
with
loud
voice
said
Father
into
thy
hands
commend
spirit
and
having
said
this
gave
the
ghost
Luke
And
when
the
centurion
saw
what
was
done
glorified
God
saying
Certainly
this
was
righteous
man
Luke
And
all
the
multitudes
that
came
together
this
sight
when
they
beheld
the
things
that
were
done
returned
smiting
their
breasts
Luke
And
all
his
acquaintance
and
the
women
that
followed
with
him
from
Galilee
stood
afar
off
seeing
these
things
Luke
And
behold
man
named
Joseph
who
was
councillor
good
and
righteous
man
Luke
had
not
consented
their
counsel
and
deed
man
Arimathæa
city
the
Jews
who
was
looking
for
the
kingdom
God
Luke
this
man
went
Pilate
and
asked
for
the
body
Jesus
Luke
And
took
down
and
wrapped
linen
cloth
and
laid
him
tomb
that
was
hewn
stone
where
never
man
had
yet
lain
Luke
And
was
the
day
the
Preparation
and
the
sabbath
drew
Luke
And
the
women
who
had
come
with
him
out
Galilee
followed
after
and
beheld
the
tomb
and
how
his
body
was
laid
Luke
And
they
returned
and
prepared
spices
and
ointments
And
the
sabbath
they
rested
according
the
commandment
Luke
But
the
first
day
the
week
early
dawn
they
came
unto
the
tomb
bringing
the
spices
which
they
had
prepared
Luke
And
they
found
the
stone
rolled
away
from
the
tomb
Luke
And
they
entered
and
found
not
the
body
the
Lord
Jesus
Luke
And
came
pass
while
they
were
perplexed
thereabout
behold
two
men
stood
them
dazzling
apparel
Luke
and
they
were
affrighted
and
bowed
down
their
faces
the
earth
they
said
unto
them
Why
seek
the
living
among
the
dead
Luke
not
here
but
risen
remember
how
spake
unto
you
when
was
yet
Galilee
Luke
saying
that
the
Son
man
must
delivered
into
the
hands
sinful
men
and
crucified
and
the
third
day
rise
again
Luke
And
they
remembered
his
words
Luke
and
returned
from
the
tomb
and
told
all
these
things
the
eleven
and
all
the
rest
Luke
Now
they
were
Mary
Magdalene
and
Joanna
and
Mary
the
mother
James
and
the
other
women
with
them
told
these
things
unto
the
apostles
Luke
And
these
words
appeared
their
sight
idle
talk
and
they
disbelieved
them
Luke
But
Peter
arose
and
ran
unto
the
tomb
and
stooping
and
looking
seeth
the
linen
cloths
themselves
and
departed
his
home
wondering
that
which
was
come
pass
Luke
And
behold
two
them
were
going
that
very
day
village
named
Emmaus
which
was
threescore
furlongs
from
Jerusalem
Luke
And
they
communed
with
each
other
all
these
things
which
had
happened
Luke
And
came
pass
while
they
communed
and
questioned
together
that
Jesus
himself
drew
near
and
went
with
them
Luke
But
their
eyes
were
holden
that
they
should
not
know
him
Luke
And
said
unto
them
What
communications
are
these
that
have
one
with
another
walk
And
they
stood
still
looking
sad
Luke
And
one
them
named
Cleopas
answering
said
unto
him
Dost
thou
alone
sojourn
Jerusalem
and
not
know
the
things
which
are
come
pass
there
these
days
Luke
And
said
unto
them
What
things
And
they
said
unto
him
The
things
concerning
Jesus
the
Nazarene
who
was
prophet
mighty
deed
and
word
before
God
and
all
the
people
Luke
and
how
the
chief
priests
and
our
rulers
delivered
him
condemned
death
and
crucified
him
Luke
But
hoped
that
was
who
should
redeem
Israel
Yea
and
besides
all
this
now
the
third
day
since
these
things
came
pass
Luke
Moreover
certain
women
our
company
amazed
having
been
early
the
tomb
Luke
and
when
they
found
not
his
body
they
came
saying
that
they
had
also
seen
vision
angels
who
said
that
was
alive
Luke
And
certain
them
that
were
with
went
the
tomb
and
found
even
the
women
had
said
but
him
they
saw
not
Luke
And
said
unto
them
foolish
men
and
slow
heart
believe
all
that
the
prophets
have
spoken
Luke
Behooved
not
the
Christ
suffer
these
things
and
enter
into
his
glory
Luke
And
beginning
from
Moses
and
from
all
the
prophets
interpreted
them
all
the
scriptures
the
things
concerning
himself
Luke
And
they
drew
nigh
unto
the
village
whither
they
were
going
and
made
though
would
further
Luke
And
they
constrained
him
saying
Abide
with
for
toward
evening
and
the
day
now
far
spent
And
went
abide
with
them
Luke
And
came
pass
when
had
sat
down
with
them
meat
took
the
bread
and
blessed
and
breaking
gave
them
Luke
And
their
eyes
were
opened
and
they
knew
him
and
vanished
out
their
sight
Luke
And
they
said
one
another
Was
not
our
heart
burning
within
while
spake
the
way
while
opened
the
scriptures
Luke
And
they
rose
that
very
hour
and
returned
Jerusalem
and
found
the
eleven
gathered
together
and
them
that
were
with
them
Luke
saying
The
Lord
risen
indeed
and
hath
appeared
Simon
Luke
And
they
rehearsed
the
things
that
happened
the
way
and
how
was
known
them
the
breaking
the
bread
Luke
And
they
spake
these
things
himself
stood
the
midst
them
and
saith
unto
them
Peace
unto
you
Luke
But
they
were
terrified
and
affrighted
and
supposed
that
they
beheld
spirit
Luke
And
said
unto
them
Why
are
troubled
and
wherefore
questionings
arise
your
heart
Luke
See
hands
and
feet
that
myself
handle
and
see
for
spirit
hath
not
flesh
and
bones
behold
having
Luke
And
when
had
said
this
showed
them
his
hands
and
his
feet
Luke
And
while
they
still
disbelieved
for
joy
and
wondered
said
unto
them
Have
here
anything
eat
Luke
And
they
gave
him
piece
broiled
fish
Luke
And
took
and
ate
before
them
Luke
And
said
unto
them
These
are
words
which
spake
unto
you
while
was
yet
with
you
that
all
things
must
needs
fulfilled
which
are
written
the
law
Moses
and
the
prophets
and
the
psalms
concerning
Luke
Then
opened
their
mind
that
they
might
understand
the
scriptures
Luke
and
said
unto
them
Thus
written
that
the
Christ
should
suffer
and
rise
again
from
the
dead
the
third
day
Luke
and
that
repentance
and
remission
sins
should
preached
his
name
unto
all
the
nations
beginning
from
Jerusalem
Luke
are
witnesses
these
things
Luke
And
behold
send
forth
the
promise
Father
upon
you
but
tarry
the
city
until
clothed
with
power
from
high
Luke
And
led
them
out
until
they
were
over
against
Bethany
and
lifted
his
hands
and
blessed
them
Luke
And
came
pass
while
blessed
them
parted
from
them
and
was
carried
into
heaven
Luke
And
they
worshipped
him
and
returned
Jerusalem
with
great
joy
Luke
and
were
continually
the
temple
blessing
God
John
the
beginning
was
the
Word
and
the
Word
was
with
God
and
the
Word
was
God
John
The
same
was
the
beginning
with
God
John
All
things
were
made
through
him
and
without
him
was
not
anything
made
that
hath
been
made
John
him
was
life
and
the
life
was
the
light
men
John
And
the
light
shineth
the
darkness
and
the
darkness
apprehended
not
John
There
came
man
sent
from
God
whose
name
was
John
John
The
same
came
for
witness
that
might
bear
witness
the
light
that
all
might
believe
through
him
John
was
not
the
light
but
came
that
might
bear
witness
the
light
John
There
was
the
true
light
even
the
light
which
lighteth
every
man
coming
into
the
world
John
was
the
world
and
the
world
was
made
through
him
and
the
world
knew
him
not
John
came
unto
his
own
and
they
that
were
his
own
received
him
not
John
But
many
received
him
them
gave
the
right
become
children
God
even
them
that
believe
his
name
John
who
were
born
not
blood
nor
the
will
the
flesh
nor
the
will
man
but
God
John
And
the
Word
became
flesh
and
dwelt
among
and
beheld
his
glory
glory
the
only
begotten
from
the
Father
full
grace
and
truth
John
John
beareth
witness
him
and
crieth
saying
This
was
whom
said
that
cometh
after
become
before
for
was
before
John
For
his
fulness
all
received
and
grace
for
grace
John
For
the
law
was
given
through
Moses
grace
and
truth
came
through
Jesus
Christ
John
man
hath
seen
God
any
time
the
only
begotten
Son
who
the
bosom
the
Father
hath
declared
him
John
And
this
the
witness
John
when
the
Jews
sent
unto
him
from
Jerusalem
priests
and
Levites
ask
him
Who
art
thou
John
And
confessed
and
denied
not
and
confessed
not
the
Christ
John
And
they
asked
him
What
then
Art
thou
Elijah
And
saith
not
Art
thou
the
prophet
And
answered
John
They
said
therefore
unto
him
Who
art
thou
that
may
give
answer
them
that
sent
What
sayest
thou
thyself
John
said
the
voice
one
crying
the
wilderness
Make
straight
the
way
the
Lord
said
Isaiah
the
prophet
John
And
they
had
been
sent
from
the
Pharisees
John
And
they
asked
him
and
said
unto
him
Why
then
baptizest
thou
thou
art
not
the
Christ
neither
Elijah
neither
the
prophet
John
John
answered
them
saying
baptize
water
the
midst
you
standeth
one
whom
know
not
John
even
that
cometh
after
the
latchet
whose
shoe
not
worthy
unloose
John
These
things
were
done
Bethany
beyond
the
Jordan
where
John
was
baptizing
John
the
morrow
seeth
Jesus
coming
unto
him
and
saith
Behold
the
Lamb
God
that
taketh
away
the
sin
the
world
John
This
whom
said
After
cometh
man
who
become
before
for
was
before
John
And
knew
him
not
but
that
should
made
manifest
Israel
for
this
cause
came
baptizing
water
John
And
John
bare
witness
saying
have
beheld
the
Spirit
descending
dove
out
heaven
and
abode
upon
him
John
And
knew
him
not
but
that
sent
baptize
water
said
unto
Upon
whomsoever
thou
shalt
see
the
Spirit
descending
and
abiding
upon
him
the
same
that
baptizeth
the
Holy
Spirit
John
And
have
seen
and
have
borne
witness
that
this
the
Son
God
John
Again
the
morrow
John
was
standing
and
two
his
disciples
John
and
looked
upon
Jesus
walked
and
saith
Behold
the
Lamb
God
John
And
the
two
disciples
heard
him
speak
and
they
followed
Jesus
John
And
Jesus
turned
and
beheld
them
following
and
saith
unto
them
What
seek
And
they
said
unto
him
Rabbi
which
say
being
interpreted
Teacher
where
abidest
thou
John
saith
unto
them
Come
and
shall
see
They
came
therefore
and
saw
where
abode
and
they
abode
with
him
that
day
was
about
the
tenth
hour
John
One
the
two
that
heard
John
speak
and
followed
him
was
Andrew
Simon
Peter
brother
John
findeth
first
his
own
brother
Simon
and
saith
unto
him
have
found
the
Messiah
which
being
interpreted
Christ
John
brought
him
unto
Jesus
Jesus
looked
upon
him
and
said
Thou
art
Simon
the
son
John
thou
shalt
called
Cephas
which
interpretation
Peter
John
the
morrow
was
minded
forth
into
Galilee
and
findeth
Philip
and
Jesus
saith
unto
him
Follow
John
Now
Philip
was
from
Bethsaida
the
city
Andrew
and
Peter
John
Philip
findeth
Nathanael
and
saith
unto
him
have
found
him
whom
Moses
the
law
and
the
prophets
wrote
Jesus
Nazareth
the
son
Joseph
John
And
Nathanael
said
unto
him
Can
any
good
thing
come
out
Nazareth
Philip
saith
unto
him
Come
and
see
John
Jesus
saw
Nathanael
coming
him
and
saith
him
Behold
Israelite
indeed
whom
guile
John
Nathanael
saith
unto
him
Whence
knowest
thou
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
Before
Philip
called
thee
when
thou
wast
under
the
fig
tree
saw
thee
John
Nathanael
answered
him
Rabbi
thou
art
the
Son
God
thou
art
King
Israel
John
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
Because
said
unto
thee
saw
thee
underneath
the
fig
tree
believest
thou
thou
shalt
see
greater
things
than
these
John
And
saith
unto
him
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
shall
see
the
heaven
opened
and
the
angels
God
ascending
and
descending
upon
the
Son
man
John
And
the
third
day
there
was
marriage
Cana
Galilee
and
the
mother
Jesus
was
there
John
and
Jesus
also
was
bidden
and
his
disciples
the
marriage
John
And
when
the
wine
failed
the
mother
Jesus
saith
unto
him
They
have
wine
John
And
Jesus
saith
unto
her
Woman
what
have
with
thee
mine
hour
not
yet
come
John
His
mother
saith
unto
the
servants
Whatsoever
saith
unto
you
John
Now
there
were
six
waterpots
stone
set
there
after
the
Jews
manner
purifying
containing
two
three
firkins
apiece
John
Jesus
saith
unto
them
Fill
the
waterpots
with
water
And
they
filled
them
the
brim
John
And
saith
unto
them
Draw
out
now
and
bear
unto
the
ruler
the
feast
And
they
bare
John
And
when
the
ruler
the
feast
tasted
the
water
now
become
wine
and
knew
not
whence
was
but
the
servants
that
had
drawn
the
water
knew
the
ruler
the
feast
calleth
the
bridegroom
John
and
saith
unto
him
Every
man
setteth
first
the
good
wine
and
when
men
have
drunk
freely
then
that
which
worse
thou
hast
kept
the
good
wine
until
now
John
This
beginning
his
signs
did
Jesus
Cana
Galilee
and
manifested
his
glory
and
his
disciples
believed
him
John
After
this
went
down
Capernaum
and
his
mother
and
his
brethren
and
his
disciples
and
there
they
abode
not
many
days
John
And
the
passover
the
Jews
was
hand
and
Jesus
went
Jerusalem
John
And
found
the
temple
those
that
sold
oxen
and
sheep
and
doves
and
the
changers
money
sitting
John
and
made
scourge
cords
and
cast
all
out
the
temple
both
the
sheep
and
the
oxen
and
poured
out
the
changers
money
and
overthrew
their
tables
John
and
them
that
sold
the
doves
said
Take
these
things
hence
make
not
Father
house
house
merchandise
John
His
disciples
remembered
that
was
written
Zeal
for
thy
house
shall
eat
John
The
Jews
therefore
answered
and
said
unto
him
What
sign
showest
thou
unto
seeing
that
thou
doest
these
things
John
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
Destroy
this
temple
and
three
days
will
raise
John
The
Jews
therefore
said
Forty
and
six
years
was
this
temple
building
and
wilt
thou
raise
three
days
John
But
spake
the
temple
his
body
John
When
therefore
was
raised
from
the
dead
his
disciples
remembered
that
spake
this
and
they
believed
the
scripture
and
the
word
which
Jesus
had
said
John
Now
when
was
Jerusalem
the
passover
during
the
feast
many
believed
his
name
beholding
his
signs
which
did
John
But
Jesus
did
not
trust
himself
unto
them
for
that
knew
all
men
John
and
because
needed
not
that
any
one
should
bear
witness
concerning
man
for
himself
knew
what
was
man
John
Now
there
was
man
the
Pharisees
named
Nicodemus
ruler
the
Jews
John
the
same
came
unto
him
night
and
said
him
Rabbi
know
that
thou
art
teacher
come
from
God
for
one
can
these
signs
that
thou
doest
except
God
with
him
John
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
Verily
verily
say
unto
thee
Except
one
born
anew
cannot
see
the
kingdom
God
John
Nicodemus
saith
unto
him
How
can
man
born
when
old
can
enter
second
time
into
his
mother
womb
and
born
John
Jesus
answered
Verily
verily
say
unto
thee
Except
one
born
water
and
the
Spirit
cannot
enter
into
the
kingdom
God
John
That
which
born
the
flesh
flesh
and
that
which
born
the
Spirit
spirit
John
Marvel
not
that
said
unto
thee
must
born
anew
John
The
wind
bloweth
where
will
and
thou
hearest
the
voice
thereof
but
knowest
not
whence
cometh
and
whither
goeth
every
one
that
born
the
Spirit
John
Nicodemus
answered
and
said
unto
him
How
can
these
things
John
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
Art
thou
the
teacher
Israel
and
understandest
not
these
things
John
Verily
verily
say
unto
thee
speak
that
which
know
and
bear
witness
that
which
have
seen
and
receive
not
our
witness
John
told
you
earthly
things
and
believe
not
how
shall
believe
tell
you
heavenly
things
John
And
one
hath
ascended
into
heaven
but
that
descended
out
heaven
even
the
Son
man
who
heaven
John
And
Moses
lifted
the
serpent
the
wilderness
even
must
the
Son
man
lifted
John
that
whosoever
believeth
may
him
have
eternal
life
John
For
God
loved
the
world
that
gave
his
only
begotten
Son
that
whosoever
believeth
him
should
not
perish
but
have
eternal
life
John
For
God
sent
not
the
Son
into
the
world
judge
the
world
but
that
the
world
should
saved
through
him
John
that
believeth
him
not
judged
that
believeth
not
hath
been
judged
already
because
hath
not
believed
the
name
the
only
begotten
Son
God
John
And
this
the
judgment
that
the
light
come
into
the
world
and
men
loved
the
darkness
rather
than
the
light
for
their
works
were
evil
John
For
every
one
that
doeth
evil
hateth
the
light
and
cometh
not
the
light
lest
his
works
should
reproved
John
But
that
doeth
the
truth
cometh
the
light
that
his
works
may
made
manifest
that
they
have
been
wrought
God
John
After
these
things
came
Jesus
and
his
disciples
into
the
land
Judea
and
there
tarried
with
them
and
baptized
John
And
John
also
was
baptizing
Ænon
near
Salim
because
there
was
much
water
there
and
they
came
and
were
baptized
John
For
John
was
not
yet
cast
into
prison
John
There
arose
therefore
questioning
the
part
John
disciples
with
Jew
about
purifying
John
And
they
came
unto
John
and
said
him
Rabbi
that
was
with
thee
beyond
the
Jordan
whom
thou
hast
borne
witness
behold
the
same
baptizeth
and
all
men
come
him
John
John
answered
and
said
man
can
receive
nothing
except
have
been
given
him
from
heaven
John
yourselves
bear
witness
that
said
not
the
Christ
but
that
sent
before
him
John
that
hath
the
bride
the
bridegroom
but
the
friend
the
bridegroom
that
standeth
and
heareth
him
rejoiceth
greatly
because
the
bridegroom
voice
this
joy
therefore
made
full
John
must
increase
but
must
decrease
John
that
cometh
from
above
above
all
that
the
earth
the
earth
and
the
earth
speaketh
that
cometh
from
heaven
above
all
John
What
hath
seen
and
heard
that
beareth
witness
and
man
receiveth
his
witness
John
that
hath
received
his
witness
hath
set
his
seal
this
that
God
true
John
For
whom
God
hath
sent
speaketh
the
words
God
for
giveth
not
the
Spirit
measure
John
The
Father
loveth
the
Son
and
hath
given
all
things
into
his
hand
John
that
believeth
the
Son
hath
eternal
life
but
that
obeyeth
not
the
Son
shall
not
see
life
but
the
wrath
God
abideth
him
John
When
therefore
the
Lord
knew
that
the
Pharisees
had
heard
that
Jesus
was
making
and
baptizing
more
disciples
than
John
John
although
Jesus
himself
baptized
not
but
his
disciples
John
left
Judea
and
departed
again
into
Galilee
John
And
must
needs
pass
through
Samaria
John
cometh
city
Samaria
called
Sychar
near
the
parcel
ground
that
Jacob
gave
his
son
Joseph
John
and
Jacob
well
was
there
Jesus
therefore
being
wearied
with
his
journey
sat
thus
the
well
was
about
the
sixth
hour
John
There
cometh
woman
Samaria
draw
water
Jesus
saith
unto
her
Give
drink
John
For
his
disciples
were
gone
away
into
the
city
buy
food
John
The
Samaritan
woman
therefore
saith
unto
him
How
that
thou
being
Jew
askest
drink
who
Samaritan
woman
For
Jews
have
dealings
with
Samaritans
John
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
her
thou
knewest
the
gift
God
and
who
that
saith
thee
Give
drink
thou
wouldest
have
asked
him
and
would
have
given
thee
living
water
John
The
woman
saith
unto
him
Sir
thou
hast
nothing
draw
with
and
the
well
deep
whence
then
hast
thou
that
living
water
John
Art
thou
greater
than
our
father
Jacob
who
gave
the
well
and
drank
thereof
himself
and
his
sons
and
his
cattle
John
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
her
Every
one
that
drinketh
this
water
shall
thirst
again
John
but
whosoever
drinketh
the
water
that
shall
give
him
shall
never
thirst
but
the
water
that
shall
give
him
shall
become
him
well
water
springing
unto
eternal
life
John
The
woman
saith
unto
him
Sir
give
this
water
that
thirst
not
neither
come
all
the
way
hither
draw
John
Jesus
saith
unto
her
call
thy
husband
and
come
hither
John
The
woman
answered
and
said
unto
him
have
husband
Jesus
saith
unto
her
Thou
saidst
well
have
husband
John
for
thou
hast
had
five
husbands
and
whom
thou
now
hast
not
thy
husband
this
hast
thou
said
truly
John
The
woman
saith
unto
him
Sir
perceive
that
thou
art
prophet
John
Our
fathers
worshipped
this
mountain
and
say
that
Jerusalem
the
place
where
men
ought
worship
John
Jesus
saith
unto
her
Woman
believe
the
hour
cometh
when
neither
this
mountain
nor
Jerusalem
shall
worship
the
Father
John
worship
that
which
know
not
worship
that
which
know
for
salvation
from
the
Jews
John
But
the
hour
cometh
and
now
when
the
true
worshippers
shall
worship
the
Father
spirit
and
truth
for
such
doth
the
Father
seek
his
worshippers
John
God
Spirit
and
they
that
worship
him
must
worship
spirit
and
truth
John
The
woman
saith
unto
him
know
that
Messiah
cometh
that
called
Christ
when
come
will
declare
unto
all
things
John
Jesus
saith
unto
her
that
speak
unto
thee
John
And
upon
this
came
his
disciples
and
they
marvelled
that
was
speaking
with
woman
yet
man
said
What
seekest
thou
Why
speakest
thou
with
her
John
the
woman
left
her
waterpot
and
went
away
into
the
city
and
saith
the
people
John
Come
see
man
who
told
all
things
that
ever
did
can
this
the
Christ
John
They
went
out
the
city
and
were
coming
him
John
the
mean
while
the
disciples
prayed
him
saying
Rabbi
eat
John
But
said
unto
them
have
meat
eat
that
know
not
John
The
disciples
therefore
said
one
another
Hath
any
man
brought
him
aught
eat
John
Jesus
saith
unto
them
meat
the
will
him
that
sent
and
accomplish
his
work
John
Say
not
There
are
yet
four
months
and
then
cometh
the
harvest
behold
say
unto
you
Lift
your
eyes
and
look
the
fields
that
they
are
white
already
unto
harvest
John
that
reapeth
receiveth
wages
and
gathereth
fruit
unto
life
eternal
that
that
soweth
and
that
reapeth
may
rejoice
together
John
For
herein
the
saying
true
One
soweth
and
another
reapeth
John
sent
you
reap
that
whereon
have
not
labored
others
have
labored
and
are
entered
into
their
labor
John
And
from
that
city
many
the
Samaritans
believed
him
because
the
word
the
woman
who
testified
told
all
things
that
ever
did
John
when
the
Samaritans
came
unto
him
they
besought
him
abide
with
them
and
abode
there
two
days
John
And
many
more
believed
because
his
word
John
and
they
said
the
woman
Now
believe
not
because
thy
speaking
for
have
heard
for
ourselves
and
know
that
this
indeed
the
Saviour
the
world
John
And
after
the
two
days
went
forth
from
thence
into
Galilee
John
For
Jesus
himself
testified
that
prophet
hath
honor
his
own
country
John
when
came
into
Galilee
the
Galilæans
received
him
having
seen
all
the
things
that
did
Jerusalem
the
feast
for
they
also
went
unto
the
feast
John
came
therefore
again
unto
Cana
Galilee
where
made
the
water
wine
And
there
was
certain
nobleman
whose
son
was
sick
Capernaum
John
When
heard
that
Jesus
was
come
out
Judæa
into
Galilee
went
unto
him
and
besought
him
that
would
come
down
and
heal
his
son
for
was
the
point
death
John
Jesus
therefore
said
unto
him
Except
see
signs
and
wonders
will
wise
believe
John
The
nobleman
saith
unto
him
Sir
come
down
ere
child
die
John
Jesus
saith
unto
him
thy
way
thy
son
liveth
The
man
believed
the
word
that
Jesus
spake
unto
him
and
went
his
way
John
And
was
now
going
down
his
servants
met
him
saying
that
his
son
lived
John
inquired
them
the
hour
when
began
amend
They
said
therefore
unto
him
Yesterday
the
seventh
hour
the
fever
left
him
John
the
father
knew
that
was
that
hour
which
Jesus
said
unto
him
Thy
son
liveth
and
himself
believed
and
his
whole
house
John
This
again
the
second
sign
that
Jesus
did
having
come
out
Judæa
into
Galilee
John
After
these
things
there
was
feast
the
Jews
and
Jesus
went
Jerusalem
John
Now
there
Jerusalem
the
sheep
gate
pool
which
called
Hebrew
Bethesda
having
five
porches
John
these
lay
multitude
them
that
were
sick
blind
halt
withered
John
John
And
certain
man
was
there
who
had
been
thirty
and
eight
years
his
infirmity
John
When
Jesus
saw
him
lying
and
knew
that
had
been
now
long
time
that
case
saith
unto
him
Wouldest
thou
made
whole
John
The
sick
man
answered
him
Sir
have
man
when
the
water
troubled
put
into
the
pool
but
while
coming
another
steppeth
down
before
John
Jesus
saith
unto
him
Arise
take
thy
bed
and
walk
John
And
straightway
the
man
was
made
whole
and
took
his
bed
and
walked
Now
was
the
sabbath
that
day
John
the
Jews
said
unto
him
that
was
cured
the
sabbath
and
not
lawful
for
thee
take
thy
bed
John
But
answered
them
that
made
whole
the
same
said
unto
Take
thy
bed
and
walk
John
They
asked
him
Who
the
man
that
said
unto
thee
Take
thy
bed
and
walk
John
But
that
was
healed
knew
not
who
was
for
Jesus
had
conveyed
himself
away
multitude
being
the
place
John
Afterward
Jesus
findeth
him
the
temple
and
said
unto
him
Behold
thou
art
made
whole
sin
more
lest
worse
thing
befall
thee
John
The
man
went
away
and
told
the
Jews
that
was
Jesus
who
had
made
him
whole
John
And
for
this
cause
the
Jews
persecuted
Jesus
because
did
these
things
the
sabbath
John
But
Jesus
answered
them
Father
worketh
even
until
now
and
work
John
For
this
cause
therefore
the
Jews
sought
the
more
kill
him
because
not
only
brake
the
sabbath
but
also
called
God
his
own
Father
making
himself
equal
with
God
John
Jesus
therefore
answered
and
said
unto
them
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
The
Son
can
nothing
himself
but
what
seeth
the
Father
doing
for
what
things
soever
doeth
these
the
Son
also
doeth
like
manner
John
For
the
Father
loveth
the
Son
and
showeth
him
all
things
that
himself
doeth
and
greater
works
than
these
will
show
him
that
may
marvel
John
For
the
Father
raiseth
the
dead
and
giveth
them
life
even
the
Son
also
giveth
life
whom
will
John
For
neither
doth
the
Father
judge
any
man
but
hath
given
all
judgment
unto
the
Son
John
that
all
may
honor
the
Son
even
they
honor
the
Father
that
honoreth
not
the
Son
honoreth
not
the
Father
that
sent
him
John
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
that
heareth
word
and
believeth
him
that
sent
hath
eternal
life
and
cometh
not
into
judgment
but
hath
passed
out
death
into
life
John
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
The
hour
cometh
and
now
when
the
dead
shall
hear
the
voice
the
Son
God
and
they
that
hear
shall
live
John
For
the
Father
hath
life
himself
even
gave
the
Son
also
have
life
himself
John
and
gave
him
authority
execute
judgment
because
son
man
John
Marvel
not
this
for
the
hour
cometh
which
all
that
are
the
tombs
shall
hear
his
voice
John
and
shall
come
forth
they
that
have
done
good
unto
the
resurrection
life
and
they
that
have
done
evil
unto
the
resurrection
judgment
John
can
myself
nothing
hear
judge
and
judgment
righteous
because
seek
not
mine
own
will
but
the
will
him
that
sent
John
bear
witness
myself
witness
not
true
John
another
that
beareth
witness
and
know
that
the
witness
which
witnesseth
true
John
have
sent
unto
John
and
hath
borne
witness
unto
the
truth
John
But
the
witness
which
receive
not
from
man
howbeit
say
these
things
that
may
saved
John
was
the
lamp
that
burneth
and
shineth
and
were
willing
rejoice
for
season
his
light
John
But
the
witness
which
have
greater
than
that
John
for
the
works
which
the
Father
hath
given
accomplish
the
very
works
that
bear
witness
that
the
Father
hath
sent
John
And
the
Father
that
sent
hath
borne
witness
have
neither
heard
his
voice
any
time
nor
seen
his
form
John
And
have
not
his
word
abiding
you
for
whom
sent
him
believe
not
John
search
the
scriptures
because
think
that
them
have
eternal
life
and
these
are
they
which
bear
witness
John
and
will
not
come
that
may
have
life
John
receive
not
glory
from
men
John
But
know
you
that
have
not
the
love
God
yourselves
John
come
Father
name
and
receive
not
another
shall
come
his
own
name
him
will
receive
John
How
can
believe
who
receive
glory
one
another
and
the
glory
that
cometh
from
the
only
God
seek
not
John
Think
not
that
will
accuse
you
the
Father
there
one
that
accuseth
you
even
Moses
whom
have
set
your
hope
John
For
believed
Moses
would
believe
for
wrote
John
But
believe
not
his
writings
how
shall
believe
words
John
After
these
things
Jesus
went
away
the
other
side
the
sea
Galilee
which
the
sea
Tiberias
John
And
great
multitude
followed
him
because
they
beheld
the
signs
which
did
them
that
were
sick
John
And
Jesus
went
into
the
mountain
and
there
sat
with
his
disciples
John
Now
the
passover
the
feast
the
Jews
was
hand
John
Jesus
therefore
lifting
his
eyes
and
seeing
that
great
multitude
cometh
unto
him
saith
unto
Philip
Whence
are
buy
bread
that
these
may
eat
John
And
this
said
prove
him
for
himself
knew
what
would
John
Philip
answered
him
Two
hundred
shillings
worth
bread
not
sufficient
for
them
that
every
one
may
take
little
John
One
his
disciples
Andrew
Simon
Peter
brother
saith
unto
him
John
There
lad
here
who
hath
five
barley
loaves
and
two
fishes
but
what
are
these
among
many
John
Jesus
said
Make
the
people
sit
down
Now
there
was
much
grass
the
place
the
men
sat
down
number
about
five
thousand
John
Jesus
therefore
took
the
loaves
and
having
given
thanks
distributed
them
that
were
set
down
likewise
also
the
fishes
much
they
would
John
And
when
they
were
filled
saith
unto
his
disciples
Gather
the
broken
pieces
which
remain
over
that
nothing
lost
John
they
gathered
them
and
filled
twelve
baskets
with
broken
pieces
from
the
five
barley
loaves
which
remained
over
unto
them
that
had
eaten
John
When
therefore
the
people
saw
the
sign
which
did
they
said
This
truth
the
prophet
that
cometh
into
the
world
John
Jesus
therefore
perceiving
that
they
were
about
come
and
take
him
force
make
him
king
withdrew
again
into
the
mountain
himself
alone
John
And
when
evening
came
his
disciples
went
down
unto
the
sea
John
and
they
entered
into
boat
and
were
going
over
the
sea
unto
Capernaum
And
was
now
dark
and
Jesus
had
not
yet
come
them
John
And
the
sea
was
rising
reason
great
wind
that
blew
John
When
therefore
they
had
rowed
about
five
and
twenty
thirty
furlongs
they
behold
Jesus
walking
the
sea
and
drawing
nigh
unto
the
boat
and
they
were
afraid
John
But
saith
unto
them
not
afraid
John
They
were
willing
therefore
receive
him
into
the
boat
and
straightway
the
boat
was
the
land
whither
they
were
going
John
the
morrow
the
multitude
that
stood
the
other
side
the
sea
saw
that
there
was
other
boat
there
save
one
and
that
Jesus
entered
not
with
his
disciples
into
the
boat
but
that
his
disciples
went
away
alone
John
howbeit
there
came
boats
from
Tiberias
nigh
unto
the
place
where
they
ate
the
bread
after
the
Lord
had
given
thanks
John
when
the
multitude
therefore
saw
that
Jesus
was
not
there
neither
his
disciples
they
themselves
got
into
the
boats
and
came
Capernaum
seeking
Jesus
John
And
when
they
found
him
the
other
side
the
sea
they
said
unto
him
Rabbi
when
camest
thou
hither
John
Jesus
answered
them
and
said
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
seek
not
because
saw
signs
but
because
ate
the
loaves
and
were
filled
John
Work
not
for
the
food
which
perisheth
but
for
the
food
which
abideth
unto
eternal
life
which
the
Son
man
shall
give
unto
you
for
him
the
Father
even
God
hath
sealed
John
They
said
therefore
unto
him
What
must
that
may
work
the
works
God
John
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
This
the
work
God
that
believe
him
whom
hath
sent
John
They
said
therefore
unto
him
What
then
doest
thou
for
sign
that
may
see
and
believe
thee
what
workest
thou
John
Our
fathers
ate
the
manna
the
wilderness
written
gave
them
bread
out
heaven
eat
John
Jesus
therefore
said
unto
them
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
was
not
Moses
that
gave
you
the
bread
out
heaven
but
Father
giveth
you
the
true
bread
out
heaven
John
For
the
bread
God
that
which
cometh
down
out
heaven
and
giveth
life
unto
the
world
John
They
said
therefore
unto
him
Lord
evermore
give
this
bread
John
Jesus
said
unto
them
the
bread
life
that
cometh
shall
not
hunger
and
that
believeth
shall
never
thirst
John
But
said
unto
you
that
have
seen
and
yet
believe
not
John
All
that
which
the
Father
giveth
shall
come
unto
and
him
that
cometh
will
wise
cast
out
John
For
come
down
from
heaven
not
mine
own
will
but
the
will
him
that
sent
John
And
this
the
will
him
that
sent
that
all
that
which
hath
given
should
lose
nothing
but
should
raise
the
last
day
John
For
this
the
will
Father
that
every
one
that
beholdeth
the
Son
and
believeth
him
should
have
eternal
life
and
will
raise
him
the
last
day
John
The
Jews
therefore
murmured
concerning
him
because
said
the
bread
which
came
down
out
heaven
John
And
they
said
not
this
Jesus
the
son
Joseph
whose
father
and
mother
know
how
doth
now
say
come
down
out
heaven
John
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
Murmur
not
among
yourselves
John
man
can
come
except
the
Father
that
sent
draw
him
and
will
raise
him
the
last
day
John
written
the
prophets
And
they
shall
all
taught
God
Every
one
that
hath
heard
from
the
Father
and
hath
learned
cometh
unto
John
Not
that
any
man
hath
seen
the
Father
save
that
from
God
hath
seen
the
Father
John
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
that
believeth
hath
eternal
life
John
the
bread
life
John
Your
fathers
ate
the
manna
the
wilderness
and
they
died
John
This
the
bread
which
cometh
down
out
heaven
that
man
may
eat
thereof
and
not
die
John
the
living
bread
which
came
down
out
heaven
any
man
eat
this
bread
shall
live
for
ever
yea
and
the
bread
which
will
give
flesh
for
the
life
the
world
John
The
Jews
therefore
strove
one
with
another
saying
How
can
this
man
give
his
flesh
eat
John
Jesus
therefore
said
unto
them
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
Except
eat
the
flesh
the
Son
man
and
drink
his
blood
have
not
life
yourselves
John
that
eateth
flesh
and
drinketh
blood
hath
eternal
life
and
will
raise
him
the
last
day
John
For
flesh
meat
indeed
and
blood
drink
indeed
John
that
eateth
flesh
and
drinketh
blood
abideth
and
him
John
the
living
Father
sent
and
live
because
the
Father
that
eateth
also
shall
live
because
John
This
the
bread
which
came
down
out
heaven
not
the
fathers
ate
and
died
that
eateth
this
bread
shall
live
for
ever
John
These
things
said
the
synagogue
taught
Capernaum
John
Many
therefore
his
disciples
when
they
heard
this
said
This
hard
saying
who
can
hear
John
But
Jesus
knowing
himself
that
his
disciples
murmured
this
said
unto
them
Doth
this
cause
you
stumble
John
What
then
should
behold
the
Son
man
ascending
where
was
before
John
the
spirit
that
giveth
life
the
flesh
profiteth
nothing
the
words
that
have
spoken
unto
you
are
spirit
and
are
life
John
But
there
are
some
you
that
believe
not
For
Jesus
knew
from
the
beginning
who
they
were
that
believed
not
and
who
was
that
should
betray
him
John
And
said
For
this
cause
have
said
unto
you
that
man
can
come
unto
except
given
unto
him
the
Father
John
Upon
this
many
his
disciples
went
back
and
walked
more
with
him
John
Jesus
said
therefore
unto
the
twelve
Would
also
away
John
Simon
Peter
answered
him
Lord
whom
shall
thou
hast
the
words
eternal
life
John
And
have
believed
and
know
that
thou
art
the
Holy
One
God
John
Jesus
answered
them
Did
not
choose
you
the
twelve
and
one
you
devil
John
Now
spake
Judas
the
son
Simon
Iscariot
for
was
that
should
betray
him
being
one
the
twelve
John
And
after
these
things
Jesus
walked
Galilee
for
would
not
walk
Judæa
because
the
Jews
sought
kill
him
John
Now
the
feast
the
Jews
the
feast
tabernacles
was
hand
John
His
brethren
therefore
said
unto
him
Depart
hence
and
into
Judæa
that
thy
disciples
also
may
behold
thy
works
which
thou
doest
John
For
man
doeth
anything
secret
and
himself
seeketh
known
openly
thou
doest
these
things
manifest
thyself
the
world
John
For
even
his
brethren
did
not
believe
him
John
Jesus
therefore
saith
unto
them
time
not
yet
come
but
your
time
always
ready
John
The
world
cannot
hate
you
but
hateth
because
testify
that
its
works
are
evil
John
unto
the
feast
not
unto
this
feast
because
time
not
yet
fulfilled
John
And
having
said
these
things
unto
them
abode
still
Galilee
John
But
when
his
brethren
were
gone
unto
the
feast
then
went
also
not
publicly
but
were
secret
John
The
Jews
therefore
sought
him
the
feast
and
said
Where
John
And
there
was
much
murmuring
among
the
multitudes
concerning
him
some
said
good
man
others
said
Not
but
leadeth
the
multitude
astray
John
Yet
man
spake
openly
him
for
fear
the
Jews
John
But
when
was
now
the
midst
the
feast
Jesus
went
into
the
temple
and
taught
John
The
Jews
therefore
marvelled
saying
How
knoweth
this
man
letters
having
never
learned
John
Jesus
therefore
answered
them
and
said
teaching
not
mine
but
his
that
sent
John
any
man
willeth
his
will
shall
know
the
teaching
whether
God
whether
speak
from
myself
John
that
speaketh
from
himself
seeketh
his
own
glory
but
that
seeketh
the
glory
him
that
sent
him
the
same
true
and
unrighteousness
him
John
Did
not
Moses
give
you
the
law
and
yet
none
you
doeth
the
law
Why
seek
kill
John
The
multitude
answered
Thou
hast
demon
who
seeketh
kill
thee
John
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
did
one
work
and
all
marvel
because
thereof
John
Moses
hath
given
you
circumcision
not
that
Moses
but
the
fathers
and
the
sabbath
circumcise
man
John
man
receiveth
circumcision
the
sabbath
that
the
law
Moses
may
not
broken
are
wroth
with
because
made
man
every
whit
whole
the
sabbath
John
Judge
not
according
appearance
but
judge
righteous
judgment
John
Some
therefore
them
Jerusalem
said
not
this
whom
they
seek
kill
John
And
speaketh
openly
and
they
say
nothing
unto
him
Can
that
the
rulers
indeed
know
that
this
the
Christ
John
Howbeit
know
this
man
whence
but
when
the
Christ
cometh
one
knoweth
whence
John
Jesus
therefore
cried
the
temple
teaching
and
saying
both
know
and
know
whence
and
not
come
myself
but
that
sent
true
whom
know
not
John
know
him
because
from
him
and
sent
John
They
sought
therefore
take
him
and
man
laid
his
hand
him
because
his
hour
was
not
yet
come
John
But
the
multitude
many
believed
him
and
they
said
When
the
Christ
shall
come
will
more
signs
than
those
which
this
man
hath
done
John
The
Pharisees
heard
the
multitude
murmuring
these
things
concerning
him
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
sent
officers
take
him
John
Jesus
therefore
said
Yet
little
while
with
you
and
unto
him
that
sent
John
shall
seek
and
shall
not
find
and
where
cannot
come
John
The
Jews
therefore
said
among
themselves
Whither
will
this
man
that
shall
not
find
him
will
unto
the
Dispersion
among
the
Greeks
and
teach
the
Greeks
John
What
this
word
that
said
shall
seek
and
shall
not
find
and
where
cannot
come
John
Now
the
last
day
the
great
day
the
feast
Jesus
stood
and
cried
saying
any
man
thirst
let
him
come
unto
and
drink
John
that
believeth
the
scripture
hath
said
from
within
him
shall
flow
rivers
living
water
John
But
this
spake
the
Spirit
which
they
that
believed
him
were
receive
for
the
Spirit
was
not
yet
given
because
Jesus
was
not
yet
glorified
John
Some
the
multitude
therefore
when
they
heard
these
words
said
This
truth
the
prophet
John
Others
said
This
the
Christ
But
some
said
What
doth
the
Christ
come
out
Galilee
John
Hath
not
the
scripture
said
that
the
Christ
cometh
the
seed
David
and
from
Bethlehem
the
village
where
David
was
John
there
arose
division
the
multitude
because
him
John
And
some
them
would
have
taken
him
but
man
laid
hands
him
John
The
officers
therefore
came
the
chief
priests
and
Pharisees
and
they
said
unto
them
Why
did
not
bring
him
John
The
officers
answered
Never
man
spake
John
The
Pharisees
therefore
answered
them
Are
also
led
astray
John
Hath
any
the
rulers
believed
him
the
Pharisees
John
But
this
multitude
that
knoweth
not
the
law
are
accursed
John
Nicodemus
saith
unto
them
that
came
him
before
being
one
them
John
Doth
our
law
judge
man
except
first
hear
from
himself
and
know
what
doeth
John
They
answered
and
said
unto
him
Art
thou
also
Galilee
Search
and
see
that
out
Galilee
ariseth
prophet
John
And
they
went
every
man
unto
his
own
house
John
but
Jesus
went
unto
the
mount
Olives
John
And
early
the
morning
came
again
into
the
temple
and
all
the
people
came
unto
him
and
sat
down
and
taught
them
John
And
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
bring
woman
taken
adultery
and
having
set
her
the
midst
John
they
say
unto
him
Teacher
this
woman
hath
been
taken
adultery
the
very
act
John
Now
the
law
Moses
commanded
stone
such
what
then
sayest
thou
her
John
And
this
they
said
trying
him
that
they
might
have
whereof
accuse
him
But
Jesus
stooped
down
and
with
his
finger
wrote
the
ground
John
But
when
they
continued
asking
him
lifted
himself
and
said
unto
them
that
without
sin
among
you
let
him
first
cast
stone
her
John
And
again
stooped
down
and
with
his
finger
wrote
the
ground
John
And
they
when
they
heard
went
out
one
one
beginning
from
the
eldest
even
unto
the
last
and
Jesus
was
left
alone
and
the
woman
where
she
was
the
midst
John
And
Jesus
lifted
himself
and
said
unto
her
Woman
where
are
they
did
man
condemn
thee
John
And
she
said
man
Lord
And
Jesus
said
Neither
condemn
thee
thy
way
from
henceforth
sin
more
John
Again
therefore
Jesus
spake
unto
them
saying
the
light
the
world
that
followeth
shall
not
walk
the
darkness
but
shall
have
the
light
life
John
The
Pharisees
therefore
said
unto
him
Thou
bearest
witness
thyself
thy
witness
not
true
John
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
Even
bear
witness
myself
witness
true
for
know
whence
came
and
whither
but
know
not
whence
come
whither
John
judge
after
the
flesh
judge
man
John
Yea
and
judge
judgment
true
for
not
alone
but
and
the
Father
that
sent
John
Yea
and
your
law
written
that
the
witness
two
men
true
John
that
beareth
witness
myself
and
the
Father
that
sent
beareth
witness
John
They
said
therefore
unto
him
Where
thy
Father
Jesus
answered
know
neither
nor
Father
knew
would
know
Father
also
John
These
words
spake
the
treasury
taught
the
temple
and
man
took
him
because
his
hour
was
not
yet
come
John
said
therefore
again
unto
them
away
and
shall
seek
and
shall
die
your
sin
whither
cannot
come
John
The
Jews
therefore
said
Will
kill
himself
that
saith
Whither
cannot
come
John
And
said
unto
them
are
from
beneath
from
above
are
this
world
not
this
world
John
said
therefore
unto
you
that
shall
die
your
sins
for
except
believe
that
shall
die
your
sins
John
They
said
therefore
unto
him
Who
art
thou
Jesus
said
unto
them
Even
that
which
have
also
spoken
unto
you
from
the
beginning
John
have
many
things
speak
and
judge
concerning
you
howbeit
that
sent
true
and
the
things
which
heard
from
him
these
speak
unto
the
world
John
They
perceived
not
that
spake
them
the
Father
John
Jesus
therefore
said
When
have
lifted
the
Son
man
then
shall
know
that
and
that
nothing
myself
but
the
Father
taught
speak
these
things
John
And
that
sent
with
hath
not
left
alone
for
always
the
things
that
are
pleasing
him
John
spake
these
things
many
believed
him
John
Jesus
therefore
said
those
Jews
that
had
believed
him
abide
word
then
are
truly
disciples
John
and
shall
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
John
They
answered
unto
him
are
Abraham
seed
and
have
never
yet
been
bondage
any
man
how
sayest
thou
shall
made
free
John
Jesus
answered
them
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
Every
one
that
committeth
sin
the
bondservant
sin
John
And
the
bondservant
abideth
not
the
house
for
ever
the
son
abideth
for
ever
John
therefore
the
Son
shall
make
you
free
shall
free
indeed
John
know
that
are
Abraham
seed
yet
seek
kill
because
word
hath
not
free
course
you
John
speak
the
things
which
have
seen
with
Father
and
also
the
things
which
heard
from
your
father
John
They
answered
and
said
unto
him
Our
father
Abraham
Jesus
saith
unto
them
were
Abraham
children
would
the
works
Abraham
John
But
now
seek
kill
man
that
hath
told
you
the
truth
which
heard
from
God
this
did
not
Abraham
John
the
works
your
father
They
said
unto
him
were
not
born
fornication
have
one
Father
even
God
John
Jesus
said
unto
them
God
were
your
Father
would
love
for
came
forth
and
come
from
God
for
neither
have
come
myself
but
sent
John
Why
not
understand
speech
Even
because
cannot
hear
word
John
are
your
father
the
devil
and
the
lusts
your
father
your
will
was
murderer
from
the
beginning
and
standeth
not
the
truth
because
there
truth
him
When
speaketh
lie
speaketh
his
own
for
liar
and
the
father
thereof
John
But
because
say
the
truth
believe
not
John
Which
you
convicteth
sin
say
truth
why
not
believe
John
that
God
heareth
the
words
God
for
this
cause
hear
them
not
because
are
not
God
John
The
Jews
answered
and
said
unto
him
Say
not
well
that
thou
art
Samaritan
and
hast
demon
John
Jesus
answered
have
not
demon
but
honor
Father
and
dishonor
John
But
seek
not
mine
own
glory
there
one
that
seeketh
and
judgeth
John
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
man
keep
word
shall
never
see
death
John
The
Jews
said
unto
him
Now
know
that
thou
hast
demon
Abraham
died
and
the
prophets
and
thou
sayest
man
keep
word
shall
never
taste
death
John
Art
thou
greater
than
our
father
Abraham
who
died
and
the
prophets
died
whom
makest
thou
thyself
John
Jesus
answered
glorify
myself
glory
nothing
Father
that
glorifieth
whom
say
that
your
God
John
and
have
not
known
him
but
know
him
and
should
say
know
him
not
shall
like
unto
you
liar
but
know
him
and
keep
his
word
John
Your
father
Abraham
rejoiced
see
day
and
saw
and
was
glad
John
The
Jews
therefore
said
unto
him
Thou
art
not
yet
fifty
years
old
and
hast
thou
seen
Abraham
John
Jesus
said
unto
them
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
Before
Abraham
was
born
John
They
took
stones
therefore
cast
him
but
Jesus
hid
himself
and
went
out
the
temple
John
And
passed
saw
man
blind
from
his
birth
John
And
his
disciples
asked
him
saying
Rabbi
who
sinned
this
man
his
parents
that
should
born
blind
John
Jesus
answered
Neither
did
this
man
sin
nor
his
parents
but
that
the
works
God
should
made
manifest
him
John
must
work
the
works
him
that
sent
while
day
the
night
cometh
when
man
can
work
John
When
the
world
the
light
the
world
John
When
had
thus
spoken
spat
the
ground
and
made
clay
the
spittle
and
anointed
his
eyes
with
the
clay
John
and
said
unto
him
wash
the
pool
Siloam
which
interpretation
Sent
went
away
therefore
and
washed
and
came
seeing
John
The
neighbors
therefore
and
they
that
saw
him
aforetime
that
was
beggar
said
not
this
that
sat
and
begged
John
Others
said
others
said
but
like
him
said
John
They
said
therefore
unto
him
How
then
were
thine
eyes
opened
John
answered
The
man
that
called
Jesus
made
clay
and
anointed
mine
eyes
and
said
unto
Siloam
and
wash
went
away
and
washed
and
received
sight
John
And
they
said
unto
him
Where
saith
know
not
John
They
bring
the
Pharisees
him
that
aforetime
was
blind
John
Now
was
the
sabbath
the
day
when
Jesus
made
the
clay
and
opened
his
eyes
John
Again
therefore
the
Pharisees
also
asked
him
how
received
his
sight
And
said
unto
them
put
clay
upon
mine
eyes
and
washed
and
see
John
Some
therefore
the
Pharisees
said
This
man
not
from
God
because
keepeth
not
the
sabbath
But
others
said
How
can
man
that
sinner
such
signs
And
there
was
division
among
them
John
They
say
therefore
unto
the
blind
man
again
What
sayest
thou
him
that
opened
thine
eyes
And
said
prophet
John
The
Jews
therefore
did
not
believe
concerning
him
that
had
been
blind
and
had
received
his
sight
until
they
called
the
parents
him
that
had
received
his
sight
John
and
asked
them
saying
this
your
son
who
say
was
born
blind
how
then
doth
now
see
John
His
parents
answered
and
said
know
that
this
our
son
and
that
was
born
blind
John
but
how
now
seeth
know
not
who
opened
his
eyes
know
not
ask
him
age
shall
speak
for
himself
John
These
things
said
his
parents
because
they
feared
the
Jews
for
the
Jews
had
agreed
already
that
any
man
should
confess
him
Christ
should
put
out
the
synagogue
John
Therefore
said
his
parents
age
ask
him
John
they
called
second
time
the
man
that
was
blind
and
said
unto
him
Give
glory
God
know
that
this
man
sinner
John
therefore
answered
Whether
sinner
know
not
one
thing
know
that
whereas
was
blind
now
see
John
They
said
therefore
unto
him
What
did
thee
how
opened
thine
eyes
John
answered
them
told
you
even
now
and
did
not
hear
wherefore
would
hear
again
would
also
become
his
disciples
John
And
they
reviled
him
and
said
Thou
art
his
disciple
but
are
disciples
Moses
John
know
that
God
hath
spoken
unto
Moses
but
for
this
man
know
not
whence
John
The
man
answered
and
said
unto
them
Why
herein
the
marvel
that
know
not
whence
and
yet
opened
mine
eyes
John
know
that
God
heareth
not
sinners
but
any
man
worshipper
God
and
his
will
him
heareth
John
Since
the
world
began
was
never
heard
that
any
one
opened
the
eyes
man
born
blind
John
this
man
were
not
from
God
could
nothing
John
They
answered
and
said
unto
him
Thou
wast
altogether
born
sins
and
dost
thou
teach
And
they
cast
him
out
John
Jesus
heard
that
they
had
cast
him
out
and
finding
him
said
Dost
thou
believe
the
Son
God
John
answered
and
said
And
who
Lord
that
may
believe
him
John
Jesus
said
unto
him
Thou
hast
both
seen
him
and
that
speaketh
with
thee
John
And
said
Lord
believe
And
worshipped
him
John
And
Jesus
said
For
judgment
came
into
this
world
that
they
that
see
not
may
see
and
that
they
that
see
may
become
blind
John
Those
the
Pharisees
who
were
with
him
heard
these
things
and
said
unto
him
Are
also
blind
John
Jesus
said
unto
them
were
blind
would
have
sin
but
now
say
see
your
sin
remaineth
John
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
that
entereth
not
the
door
into
the
fold
the
sheep
but
climbeth
some
other
way
the
same
thief
and
robber
John
But
that
entereth
the
door
the
shepherd
the
sheep
John
him
the
porter
openeth
and
the
sheep
hear
his
voice
and
calleth
his
own
sheep
name
and
leadeth
them
out
John
When
hath
put
forth
all
his
own
goeth
before
them
and
the
sheep
follow
him
for
they
know
his
voice
John
And
stranger
will
they
not
follow
but
will
flee
from
him
for
they
know
not
the
voice
strangers
John
This
parable
spake
Jesus
unto
them
but
they
understood
not
what
things
they
were
which
spake
unto
them
John
Jesus
therefore
said
unto
them
again
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
the
door
the
sheep
John
All
that
came
before
are
thieves
and
robbers
but
the
sheep
did
not
hear
them
John
the
door
any
man
enter
shall
saved
and
shall
and
out
and
shall
find
pasture
John
The
thief
cometh
not
but
that
may
steal
and
kill
and
destroy
came
that
they
may
have
life
and
may
have
abundantly
John
the
good
shepherd
the
good
shepherd
layeth
down
his
life
for
the
sheep
John
that
hireling
and
not
shepherd
whose
own
the
sheep
are
not
beholdeth
the
wolf
coming
and
leaveth
the
sheep
and
fleeth
and
the
wolf
snatcheth
them
and
scattereth
them
John
fleeth
because
hireling
and
careth
not
for
the
sheep
John
the
good
shepherd
and
know
mine
own
and
mine
own
know
John
even
the
Father
knoweth
and
know
the
Father
and
lay
down
life
for
the
sheep
John
And
other
sheep
have
which
are
not
this
fold
them
also
must
bring
and
they
shall
hear
voice
and
they
shall
become
one
flock
one
shepherd
John
Therefore
doth
the
Father
love
because
lay
down
life
that
may
take
again
John
one
taketh
away
from
but
lay
down
myself
have
power
lay
down
and
have
power
take
again
This
commandment
received
from
Father
John
There
arose
division
again
among
the
Jews
because
these
words
John
And
many
them
said
hath
demon
and
mad
why
hear
him
John
Others
said
These
are
not
the
sayings
one
possessed
with
demon
Can
demon
open
the
eyes
the
blind
John
And
was
the
feast
the
dedication
Jerusalem
John
was
winter
and
Jesus
was
walking
the
temple
Solomon
porch
John
The
Jews
therefore
came
round
about
him
and
said
unto
him
How
long
dost
thou
hold
suspense
thou
art
the
Christ
tell
plainly
John
Jesus
answered
them
told
you
and
believe
not
the
works
that
Father
name
these
bear
witness
John
But
believe
not
because
are
not
sheep
John
sheep
hear
voice
and
know
them
and
they
follow
John
and
give
unto
them
eternal
life
and
they
shall
never
perish
and
one
shall
snatch
them
out
hand
John
Father
who
hath
given
them
unto
greater
than
all
and
one
able
snatch
them
out
the
Father
hand
John
and
the
Father
are
one
John
The
Jews
took
stones
again
stone
him
John
Jesus
answered
them
Many
good
works
have
showed
you
from
the
Father
for
which
those
works
stone
John
The
Jews
answered
him
For
good
work
stone
thee
not
but
for
blasphemy
and
because
that
thou
being
man
makest
thyself
God
John
Jesus
answered
them
not
written
your
law
said
are
gods
John
called
them
gods
unto
whom
the
word
God
came
and
the
scripture
cannot
broken
John
say
him
whom
the
Father
sanctified
and
sent
into
the
world
Thou
blasphemest
because
said
the
Son
God
John
not
the
works
Father
believe
not
John
But
them
though
believe
not
believe
the
works
that
may
know
and
understand
that
the
Father
and
the
Father
John
They
sought
again
take
him
and
went
forth
out
their
hand
John
And
went
away
again
beyond
the
Jordan
into
the
place
where
John
was
the
first
baptizing
and
there
abode
John
And
many
came
unto
him
and
they
said
John
indeed
did
sign
but
all
things
whatsoever
John
spake
this
man
were
true
John
And
many
believed
him
there
John
Now
certain
man
was
sick
Lazarus
Bethany
the
village
Mary
and
her
sister
Martha
John
And
was
that
Mary
who
anointed
the
Lord
with
ointment
and
wiped
his
feet
with
her
hair
whose
brother
Lazarus
was
sick
John
The
sisters
therefore
sent
unto
him
saying
Lord
behold
whom
thou
lovest
sick
John
But
when
Jesus
heard
said
This
sickness
not
unto
death
but
for
the
glory
God
that
the
Son
God
may
glorified
thereby
John
Now
Jesus
loved
Martha
and
her
sister
and
Lazarus
John
When
therefore
heard
that
was
sick
abode
that
time
two
days
the
place
where
was
John
Then
after
this
saith
the
disciples
Let
into
Judæa
again
John
The
disciples
say
unto
him
Rabbi
the
Jews
were
but
now
seeking
stone
thee
and
goest
thou
thither
again
John
Jesus
answered
Are
there
not
twelve
hours
the
day
man
walk
the
day
stumbleth
not
because
seeth
the
light
this
world
John
But
man
walk
the
night
stumbleth
because
the
light
not
him
John
These
things
spake
and
after
this
saith
unto
them
Our
friend
Lazarus
fallen
asleep
but
that
may
awake
him
out
sleep
John
The
disciples
therefore
said
unto
him
Lord
fallen
asleep
will
recover
John
Now
Jesus
had
spoken
his
death
but
they
thought
that
spake
taking
rest
sleep
John
Then
Jesus
therefore
said
unto
them
plainly
Lazarus
dead
John
And
glad
for
your
sakes
that
was
not
there
the
intent
may
believe
nevertheless
let
unto
him
John
Thomas
therefore
who
called
Didymus
said
unto
his
fellow
disciples
Let
also
that
may
die
with
him
John
when
Jesus
came
found
that
had
been
the
tomb
four
days
already
John
Now
Bethany
was
nigh
unto
Jerusalem
about
fifteen
furlongs
off
John
and
many
the
Jews
had
come
Martha
and
Mary
console
them
concerning
their
brother
John
Martha
therefore
when
she
heard
that
Jesus
was
coming
went
and
met
him
but
Mary
still
sat
the
house
John
Martha
therefore
said
unto
Jesus
Lord
thou
hadst
been
here
brother
had
not
died
John
And
even
now
know
that
whatsoever
thou
shalt
ask
God
God
will
give
thee
John
Jesus
saith
unto
her
Thy
brother
shall
rise
again
John
Martha
saith
unto
him
know
that
shall
rise
again
the
resurrection
the
last
day
John
Jesus
said
unto
her
the
resurrection
and
the
life
that
believeth
though
die
yet
shall
live
John
and
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
shall
never
die
Believest
thou
this
John
She
saith
unto
him
Yea
Lord
have
believed
that
thou
art
the
Christ
the
Son
God
even
that
cometh
into
the
world
John
And
when
she
had
said
this
she
went
away
and
called
Mary
her
sister
secretly
saying
The
Teacher
here
and
calleth
thee
John
And
she
when
she
heard
arose
quickly
and
went
unto
him
John
Now
Jesus
was
not
yet
come
into
the
village
but
was
still
the
place
where
Martha
met
him
John
The
Jews
then
who
were
with
her
the
house
and
were
consoling
her
when
they
saw
Mary
that
she
rose
quickly
and
went
out
followed
her
supposing
that
she
was
going
unto
the
tomb
weep
there
John
Mary
therefore
when
she
came
where
Jesus
was
and
saw
him
fell
down
his
feet
saying
unto
him
Lord
thou
hadst
been
here
brother
had
not
died
John
When
Jesus
therefore
saw
her
weeping
and
the
Jews
also
weeping
who
came
with
her
groaned
the
spirit
and
was
troubled
John
and
said
Where
have
laid
him
They
say
unto
him
Lord
come
and
see
John
Jesus
wept
John
The
Jews
therefore
said
Behold
how
loved
him
John
But
some
them
said
Could
not
this
man
who
opened
the
eyes
him
that
was
blind
have
caused
that
this
man
also
should
not
die
John
Jesus
therefore
again
groaning
himself
cometh
the
tomb
Now
was
cave
and
stone
lay
against
John
Jesus
saith
Take
away
the
stone
Martha
the
sister
him
that
was
dead
saith
unto
him
Lord
this
time
the
body
decayeth
for
hath
been
dead
four
days
John
Jesus
saith
unto
her
Said
not
unto
thee
that
thou
believedst
thou
shouldest
see
the
glory
God
John
they
took
away
the
stone
And
Jesus
lifted
his
eyes
and
said
Father
thank
thee
that
thou
heardest
John
And
knew
that
thou
hearest
always
but
because
the
multitude
that
standeth
around
said
that
they
may
believe
that
thou
didst
send
John
And
when
had
thus
spoken
cried
with
loud
voice
Lazarus
come
forth
John
that
was
dead
came
forth
bound
hand
and
foot
with
grave
clothes
and
his
face
was
bound
about
with
napkin
Jesus
saith
unto
them
Loose
him
and
let
him
John
Many
therefore
the
Jews
who
came
Mary
and
beheld
that
which
did
believed
him
John
But
some
them
went
away
the
Pharisees
and
told
them
the
things
which
Jesus
had
done
John
The
chief
priests
therefore
and
the
Pharisees
gathered
council
and
said
What
for
this
man
doeth
many
signs
John
let
him
thus
alone
all
men
will
believe
him
and
the
Romans
will
come
and
take
away
both
our
place
and
our
nation
John
But
certain
one
them
Caiaphas
being
high
priest
that
year
said
unto
them
know
nothing
all
John
nor
take
account
that
expedient
for
you
that
one
man
should
die
for
the
people
and
that
the
whole
nation
perish
not
John
Now
this
said
not
himself
but
being
high
priest
that
year
prophesied
that
Jesus
should
die
for
the
nation
John
and
not
for
the
nation
only
but
that
might
also
gather
together
into
one
the
children
God
that
are
scattered
abroad
John
from
that
day
forth
they
took
counsel
that
they
might
put
him
death
John
Jesus
therefore
walked
more
openly
among
the
Jews
but
departed
thence
into
the
country
near
the
wilderness
into
city
called
Ephraim
and
there
tarried
with
the
disciples
John
Now
the
passover
the
Jews
was
hand
and
many
went
Jerusalem
out
the
country
before
the
passover
purify
themselves
John
They
sought
therefore
for
Jesus
and
spake
one
with
another
they
stood
the
temple
What
think
That
will
not
come
the
feast
John
Now
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
had
given
commandment
that
any
man
knew
where
was
should
show
that
they
might
take
him
John
Jesus
therefore
six
days
before
the
passover
came
Bethany
where
Lazarus
was
whom
Jesus
raised
from
the
dead
John
they
made
him
supper
there
and
Martha
served
but
Lazarus
was
one
them
that
sat
meat
with
him
John
Mary
therefore
took
pound
ointment
pure
nard
very
precious
and
anointed
the
feet
Jesus
and
wiped
his
feet
with
her
hair
and
the
house
was
filled
with
the
odor
the
ointment
John
But
Judas
Iscariot
one
his
disciples
that
should
betray
him
saith
John
Why
was
not
this
ointment
sold
for
three
hundred
shillings
and
given
the
poor
John
Now
this
said
not
because
cared
for
the
poor
but
because
was
thief
and
having
the
bag
took
away
what
was
put
therein
John
Jesus
therefore
said
Suffer
her
keep
against
the
day
burying
John
For
the
poor
have
always
with
you
but
have
not
always
John
The
common
people
therefore
the
Jews
learned
that
was
there
and
they
came
not
for
Jesus
sake
only
but
that
they
might
see
Lazarus
also
whom
had
raised
from
the
dead
John
But
the
chief
priests
took
counsel
that
they
might
put
Lazarus
also
death
John
because
that
reason
him
many
the
Jews
went
away
and
believed
Jesus
John
the
morrow
great
multitude
that
had
come
the
feast
when
they
heard
that
Jesus
was
coming
Jerusalem
John
took
the
branches
the
palm
trees
and
went
forth
meet
him
and
cried
out
Hosanna
Blessed
that
cometh
the
name
the
Lord
even
the
King
Israel
John
And
Jesus
having
found
young
ass
sat
thereon
written
John
Fear
not
daughter
Zion
behold
thy
King
cometh
sitting
ass
colt
John
These
things
understood
not
his
disciples
the
first
but
when
Jesus
was
glorified
then
remembered
they
that
these
things
were
written
him
and
that
they
had
done
these
things
unto
him
John
The
multitude
therefore
that
was
with
him
when
called
Lazarus
out
the
tomb
and
raised
him
from
the
dead
bare
witness
John
For
this
cause
also
the
multitude
went
and
met
him
for
that
they
heard
that
had
done
this
sign
John
The
Pharisees
therefore
said
among
themselves
Behold
how
prevail
nothing
the
world
gone
after
him
John
Now
there
were
certain
Greeks
among
those
that
went
worship
the
feast
John
these
therefore
came
Philip
who
was
Bethsaida
Galilee
and
asked
him
saying
Sir
would
see
Jesus
John
Philip
cometh
and
telleth
Andrew
Andrew
cometh
and
Philip
and
they
tell
Jesus
John
And
Jesus
answereth
them
saying
The
hour
come
that
the
Son
man
should
glorified
John
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
Except
grain
wheat
fall
into
the
earth
and
die
abideth
itself
alone
but
die
beareth
much
fruit
John
that
loveth
his
life
loseth
and
that
hateth
his
life
this
world
shall
keep
unto
life
eternal
John
any
man
serve
let
him
follow
and
where
there
shall
also
servant
any
man
serve
him
will
the
Father
honor
John
Now
soul
troubled
and
what
shall
say
Father
save
from
this
hour
But
for
this
cause
came
unto
this
hour
John
Father
glorify
thy
name
There
came
therefore
voice
out
heaven
saying
have
both
glorified
and
will
glorify
again
John
The
multitude
therefore
that
stood
and
heard
said
that
had
thundered
others
said
angel
hath
spoken
him
John
Jesus
answered
and
said
This
voice
hath
not
come
for
sake
but
for
your
sakes
John
Now
the
judgment
this
world
now
shall
the
prince
this
world
cast
out
John
And
lifted
from
the
earth
will
draw
all
men
unto
myself
John
But
this
said
signifying
what
manner
death
should
die
John
The
multitude
therefore
answered
him
have
heard
out
the
law
that
the
Christ
abideth
for
ever
and
how
sayest
thou
The
Son
man
must
lifted
who
this
Son
man
John
Jesus
therefore
said
unto
them
Yet
little
while
the
light
among
you
Walk
while
have
the
light
that
darkness
overtake
you
not
and
that
walketh
the
darkness
knoweth
not
whither
goeth
John
While
have
the
light
believe
the
light
that
may
become
sons
light
These
things
spake
Jesus
and
departed
and
hid
himself
from
them
John
But
though
had
done
many
signs
before
them
yet
they
believed
not
him
John
that
the
word
Isaiah
the
prophet
might
fulfilled
which
spake
Lord
who
hath
believed
our
report
And
whom
hath
the
arm
the
Lord
been
revealed
John
For
this
cause
they
could
not
believe
for
that
Isaiah
said
again
John
hath
blinded
their
eyes
and
hardened
their
heart
Lest
they
should
see
with
their
eyes
and
perceive
with
their
heart
And
should
turn
And
should
heal
them
John
These
things
said
Isaiah
because
saw
his
glory
and
spake
him
John
Nevertheless
even
the
rulers
many
believed
him
but
because
the
Pharisees
they
did
not
confess
lest
they
should
put
out
the
synagogue
John
for
they
loved
the
glory
that
men
more
than
the
glory
that
God
John
And
Jesus
cried
and
said
that
believeth
believeth
not
but
him
that
sent
John
And
that
beholdeth
beholdeth
him
that
sent
John
come
light
into
the
world
that
whosoever
believeth
may
not
abide
the
darkness
John
And
any
man
hear
sayings
and
keep
them
not
judge
him
not
for
came
not
judge
the
world
but
save
the
world
John
that
rejecteth
and
receiveth
not
sayings
hath
one
that
judgeth
him
the
word
that
spake
the
same
shall
judge
him
the
last
day
John
For
spake
not
from
myself
but
the
Father
that
sent
hath
given
commandment
what
should
say
and
what
should
speak
John
And
know
that
his
commandment
life
eternal
the
things
therefore
which
speak
even
the
Father
hath
said
unto
speak
John
Now
before
the
feast
the
passover
Jesus
knowing
that
his
hour
was
come
that
should
depart
out
this
world
unto
his
Father
having
loved
his
own
that
were
the
world
loved
them
unto
the
end
John
And
during
supper
the
devil
having
already
put
into
the
heart
Judas
Iscariot
Simon
son
betray
him
John
Jesus
knowing
that
the
Father
had
given
all
things
into
his
hands
and
that
came
forth
from
God
and
goeth
unto
God
John
riseth
from
supper
and
layeth
aside
his
garments
and
took
towel
and
girded
himself
John
Then
poureth
water
into
the
basin
and
began
wash
the
disciples
feet
and
wipe
them
with
the
towel
wherewith
was
girded
John
cometh
Simon
Peter
saith
unto
him
Lord
dost
thou
wash
feet
John
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
What
thou
knowest
not
now
but
thou
shalt
understand
hereafter
John
Peter
saith
unto
him
Thou
shalt
never
wash
feet
Jesus
answered
him
wash
thee
not
thou
hast
part
with
John
Simon
Peter
saith
unto
him
Lord
not
feet
only
but
also
hands
and
head
John
Jesus
saith
him
that
bathed
needeth
not
save
wash
his
feet
but
clean
every
whit
and
are
clean
but
not
all
John
For
knew
him
that
should
betray
him
therefore
said
are
not
all
clean
John
when
had
washed
their
feet
and
taken
his
garments
and
sat
down
again
said
unto
them
Know
what
have
done
you
John
call
Teacher
and
Lord
and
say
well
for
John
then
the
Lord
and
the
Teacher
have
washed
your
feet
also
ought
wash
one
another
feet
John
For
have
given
you
example
that
also
should
have
done
you
John
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
servant
not
greater
than
his
lord
neither
one
that
sent
greater
than
that
sent
him
John
know
these
things
blessed
are
them
John
speak
not
you
all
know
whom
have
chosen
but
that
the
scripture
may
fulfilled
that
eateth
bread
lifted
his
heel
against
John
From
henceforth
tell
you
before
come
pass
that
when
come
pass
may
believe
that
John
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
that
receiveth
whomsoever
send
receiveth
and
that
receiveth
receiveth
him
that
sent
John
When
Jesus
had
thus
said
was
troubled
the
spirit
and
testified
and
said
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
that
one
you
shall
betray
John
The
disciples
looked
one
another
doubting
whom
spake
John
There
was
the
table
reclining
Jesus
bosom
one
his
disciples
whom
Jesus
loved
John
Simon
Peter
therefore
beckoneth
him
and
saith
unto
him
Tell
who
whom
speaketh
John
leaning
back
was
Jesus
breast
saith
unto
him
Lord
who
John
Jesus
therefore
answereth
for
whom
shall
dip
the
sop
and
give
him
when
had
dipped
the
sop
taketh
and
giveth
Judas
the
son
Simon
Iscariot
John
And
after
the
sop
then
entered
Satan
into
him
Jesus
therefore
saith
unto
him
What
thou
doest
quickly
John
Now
man
the
table
knew
for
what
intent
spake
this
unto
him
John
For
some
thought
because
Judas
had
the
bag
that
Jesus
said
unto
him
Buy
what
things
have
need
for
the
feast
that
should
give
something
the
poor
John
then
having
received
the
sop
went
out
straightway
and
was
night
John
When
therefore
was
gone
out
Jesus
saith
Now
the
Son
man
glorified
and
God
glorified
him
John
and
God
shall
glorify
him
himself
and
straightway
shall
glorify
him
John
Little
children
yet
little
while
with
you
shall
seek
and
said
unto
the
Jews
Whither

come
now
say
unto
you
John
new
commandment

unto
you

one
another

loved
you
that
also
love
one
another
John
this
shall
all
men
know
that
are
disciples
have
love
one
another
John
Simon
Peter
saith
unto
him
Lord
whither
goest
thou
Jesus
answered
Whither
thou
canst
not
follow
now
but
thou
shalt
follow
afterwards
John
Peter
saith
unto
him
Lord
why
cannot
follow
thee
even
now
will
lay
down
life
for
thee
John
Jesus
answereth
Wilt
thou
lay
down
thy
life
for
Verily
verily
say
unto
thee
The
cock
shall
not
crow
till
thou
hast
denied
thrice

Let

Jesus
saith
unto
him
the
way
and
the
truth
and

unto
the
Father
but
John

known
would
have

from
henceforth

him
and
have
seen
him
John
Philip
saith
unto
him
Lord

John
Jesus
saith
unto
him
Have

Philip
that

Believest

but

John
Believe

And

Comforter
that

Yet

John
Judas
not
Iscariot
saith
unto
him
Lord
what
come
pass
that
thou
wilt
manifest
thyself
unto

not
unto
the
world
John
Jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
man
love
will
keep
word
and
Father
will
love
him
and
will
come
unto
him
and
make
our
abode
with
him
John
that
loveth
not
keepeth
not
words
and
the
word
which
hear
not
mine
but
the
Father
who
sent
John
These
things
have
spoken
unto
you
while
yet
abiding
with
you
John
But
the
Comforter
even
the
Holy
Spirit
whom
the
Father
will
send
name
shall
teach
you
all
things
and
bring
your
remembrance
all
that
said
unto
you
John
Peace
leave
with
you
peace
give
unto
you
not
the
world
giveth
give
unto
you
Let
not
your
heart
troubled
neither
let
fearful
John
heard
how
said
you
away
and
come
unto
you
loved
would
have
rejoiced
because
unto
the
Father
for
the
Father
greater
than
John
And
now
have
told
you
before
come
pass
that
when
come
pass
may
believe
John
will
more
speak
much
with
you
for
the
prince
the
world
cometh
and
hath
nothing
John
but
that
the
world
may
know
that
love
the
Father
and
the
Father
gave
commandment
even
Arise
let
hence
John
the
true
vine
and
Father
the
husbandman
John
Every
branch
that
beareth
not
fruit
taketh
away
and
every
branch
that
beareth
fruit
cleanseth
that
may
bear
more
fruit
John
Already
are
clean
because
the
word
which
have
spoken
unto
you
John
Abide
and
you
the
branch
cannot
bear
fruit
itself
except
abide
the
vine
neither
can
except
abide
John
the
vine
are
the
branches
that
abideth
and
him
the
same
beareth
much
fruit
for
apart
from
can
nothing
John
man
abide
not
cast
forth
branch
and
withered
and
they
gather
them
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
and
they
are
burned
John
abide
and
words
abide
you
ask
whatsoever
will
and
shall
done
unto
you
John
Herein
Father
glorified
that
bear
much
fruit
and
shall
disciples
John
Even
the
Father
hath
loved
also
have
loved
you
abide
love
John
keep
commandments
shall
abide
love
even
have
kept
Father
commandments
and
abide
his
love
John
These
things
have
spoken
unto
you
that
joy
may
you
and
that
your
joy
may
made
full
John
This
commandment
that
love
one
another
even
have
loved
you
John
Greater
love
hath
man
than
this
that
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
friends
John
are
friends
the
things
which
command
you
John
longer
call
you
servants
for
the
servant
knoweth
not
what
his
lord
doeth
but
have
called
you
friends
for
all
things
that
heard
from
Father
have
made
known
unto
you
John
did
not
choose
but
chose
you
and
appointed
you
that
should
and
bear
fruit
and
that
your
fruit
should
abide
that
whatsoever
shall
ask
the
Father
name
may
give
you
John
These
things
command
you
that
may
love
one
another
John
the
world
hateth
you
know
that
hath
hated
before
hated
you
John
were
the
world
the
world
would
love
its
own
but
because
are
not
the
world
but
chose
you
out
the
world
therefore
the
world
hateth
you
John
Remember
the
word
that
said
unto
you
servant
not
greater
than
his
lord
they
persecuted
they
will
also
persecute
you
they
kept
word
they
will
keep
yours
also
John
But
all
these
things
will
they
unto
you
for
name
sake
because
they
know
not
him
that
sent
John
had
not
come
and
spoken
unto
them
they
had
not
had
sin
but
now
they
have
excuse
for
their
sin
John
that
hateth
hateth
Father
also
John
had
not
done
among
them
the
works
which
none
other
did
they
had
not
had
sin
but
now
have
they
both
seen
and
hated
both
and
Father
John
But
this
cometh
pass
that
the
word
may
fulfilled
that
written
their
law
They
hated
without
cause
John
But
when
the
Comforter
come
whom
will
send
unto
you
from
the
Father
even
the
Spirit
truth
which
proceedeth
from
the
Father
shall
bear
witness
John
and
also
bear
witness
because
have
been
with
from
the
beginning
John
These
things
have
spoken
unto
you
that
should
not
caused
stumble
John
They
shall
put
you
out
the
synagogues
yea
the
hour
cometh
that
whosoever
killeth
you
shall
think
that
offereth
service
unto
God
John
And
these
things
will
they
because
they
have
not
known
the
Father
nor
John
But
these
things
have
spoken
unto
you
that
when
their
hour
come
may
remember
them
how
that
told
you
And
these
things
said
not
unto
you
from
the
beginning
because
was
with
you
John
But
now
unto
him
that
sent
and
none
you
asketh
Whither
goest
thou
John
But
because
have
spoken
these
things
unto
you
sorrow
hath
filled
your
heart
John
Nevertheless
tell
you
the
truth
expedient
for
you
that
away
for
not
away
the
Comforter
will
not
come
unto
you
but
will
send
him
unto
you
John
And
when
come
will
convict
the
world
respect
sin
and
righteousness
and
judgment
John
sin
because
they
believe
not
John
righteousness
because
the
Father
and
behold
more
John
judgment
because
the
prince
this
world
hath
been
judged
John
have
yet
many
things
say
unto
you
but
cannot
bear
them
now
John
Howbeit
when
the
Spirit
truth
come
shall
guide
you
into
all
the
truth
for
shall
not
speak
from
himself
but
what
things
soever
shall
hear
these
shall
speak
and
shall
declare
unto
you
the
things
that
are
come
John
shall
glorify
for
shall
take
mine
and
shall
declare
unto
you
John
All
things
whatsoever
the
Father
hath
are
mine
therefore
said
that
taketh
mine
and
shall
declare
unto
you
John
little
while
and
behold
more
and
again
little
while
and
shall
see
John
Some
his
disciples
therefore
said
one
another
What
this
that
saith
unto
little
while
and
behold
not
and
again
little
while
and
shall
see
and
Because
the
Father
John
They
said
therefore
What
this
that
saith
little
while
know
not
what
saith
John
Jesus
perceived
that
they
were
desirous
ask
him
and
said
unto
them
inquire
among
yourselves
concerning
this
that
said
little
while
and
behold
not
and
again
little
while
and
shall
see
John
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
that

but
your
sorrow
shall
turned
into
joy
John
woman
when
she
travail
hath
sorrow
because
her
hour

but
when
she
delivered
the
child
she
remembereth
more
the
anguish
for
the
joy
that
man
born
into
the
world
John
And
therefore
now
have
sorrow
but
will
see
you
again
and
your
heart
shall
rejoice
and
your
joy
one
taketh
away
from
you
John
And
that
day
shall
ask
question
Verily
verily
say
unto
you
shall
ask
anything
the
Father
will
give
you
name
John
Hitherto
have
asked
nothing

and
shall
receive
that
your
joy
may
made
full
John
These
things
have
spoken
unto
you
dark
sayings
the
hour
cometh
when
shall
more
speak
unto
you
dark
sayings
but
shall
tell
you
plainly
the
Father
John
that
day
shall
ask
name
and
say
not
unto
you
that
will
pray
the
Father
for
you
John
for
the
Father
himself
loveth
you
because
have
loved
and
have
believed
that
came
forth
from
the
Father
John
came
out
from
the
Father
and
come
into
the
world
again
leave
the
world
and
unto
the
Father
John
His
disciples
say
now
speakest
thou
plainly
and
speakest
dark
saying
John
Now
know
that
thou
knowest
all
things
and
needest
not
that
any
man
should
ask
thee
this
believe
that
thou
camest
forth
from
God
John
Jesus
answered
them
now
believe
John
Behold
the
hour
cometh
yea
come
that
shall
scattered
every
man
his
own
and
shall
leave
alone
and
yet
not
alone
because
the
Father
with
John
These
things
have
spoken
unto
you
that
may
have
peace
the
world
have
tribulation
but
good
cheer
have
overcome
the
world
John
These
things
spake
Jesus
and
lifting
his
eyes
heaven
said
Father
the
hour
come
glorify
thy
Son
that
the
Son
may
glorify
thee
John
even
thou
gavest
him
authority
over
all
flesh
that
all
whom
thou
hast
given
him
should
give
eternal
life
John
And
this
life
eternal
that
they
should
know
thee
the
only
true
God
and
him
whom
thou
didst
send
even
Jesus
Christ
John
glorified
thee
the
earth
having
accomplished
the
work
which
thou
hast
given
John
And
now
Father
glorify
thou
with
thine
own
self
with
the
glory
which
had
with
thee
before
the
world
was
John
manifested
thy
name
unto
the
men
whom
thou
gavest
out
the
world
thine
they
were
and
thou
gavest
them
and
they
have
kept
thy
word
John
Now
they
know
that
all
things
whatsoever
thou
hast
given
are
from
thee
John
for
the
words
which
thou
gavest
have
given
unto
them
and
they
received
them
and

forth
from
thee
and
they
believed
that
thou

send
John
pray
for
them
pray
not

but
for

them
John
And

Holy
Father
keep

While
was
with
them
kept
them
thy
name
which
thou
hast
given
and
guarded
them
and
not
one
them
perished
but
the
son
perdition
that
the
scripture
might
fulfilled
John
But
now
come

world
that
they
may
have
joy
made
full

John
have
given
them
thy
word
and
the
world
hated
them
because
they
are
not
the
world
even
not
the
world
John
pray
not
that
thou
shouldest
take
them
from
the
world
but
that
thou
shouldest
keep
them
from
the
evil
one
John
They
are
not

Sanctify

And

Neither

John
that

John
righteous

John
When
Jesus
had
spoken
these
words
went
forth
with
his
disciples
over
the
brook
Kidron
where
was
garden
into
which
entered
himself
and
his
disciples
John
Now
Judas
also
who
betrayed
him
knew
the
place
for
Jesus
oft
times
resorted
thither
with
his
disciples
John
Judas
then
having
received
the
band
soldiers
and
officers
from
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
cometh
thither
with
lanterns
and
torches
and
weapons
John
Jesus
therefore
knowing
all
the
things
that
were
coming
upon
him
went
forth
and
saith
unto
them
Whom
seek
John
They
answered
him
Jesus
Nazareth
Jesus
saith
unto
them
And
Judas
also
who
betrayed
him
was
standing
with
them
John
When
therefore
said
unto
them
they
went
backward
and
fell
the
ground
John
Again
therefore
asked
them
Whom
seek
And
they
said
Jesus
Nazareth
John
Jesus
answered
told
you
that
therefore
seek
let
these
their
way
John
that
the
word
might
fulfilled
which
spake
those
whom
thou
hast
given
lost
not
one
John
Simon
Peter
therefore
having
sword
drew
and
struck
the
high
priest
servant
and
cut
off
his
right
ear
Now
the
servant
name
was
Malchus
John
Jesus
therefore
said
unto
Peter
Put
the
sword
into
the
sheath
the
cup
which
the
Father
hath
given
shall
not
drink
John
the
band
and
the
chief
captain
and
the
officers
the
Jews
seized
Jesus
and
bound
him
John
and
led
him
Annas
first
for
was
father
law
Caiaphas
who
was
high
priest
that
year
John
Now
Caiaphas
was
that
gave
counsel
the
Jews
that
was
expedient
that
one
man
should
die
for
the
people
John
And
Simon
Peter
followed
Jesus
and
did
another
disciple
Now
that
disciple
was
known
unto
the
high
priest
and
entered
with
Jesus
into
the
court
the
high
priest
John
but
Peter
was
standing
the
door
without
the
other
disciple
who
was
known
unto
the
high
priest
went
out
and
spake
unto
her
that
kept
the
door
and
brought
Peter
John
The
maid
therefore
that
kept
the
door
saith
unto
Peter
Art
thou
also
one
this
man
disciples
saith
not
John
Now
the
servants
and
the
officers
were
standing
there
having
made
fire
coals
for
was
cold
and
they
were
warming
themselves
and
Peter
also
was
with
them
standing
and
warming
himself
John
The
high
priest
therefore
asked
Jesus
his
disciples
and
his
teaching
John
Jesus
answered
him
have
spoken
openly
the
world
ever
taught
synagogues
and
the
temple
where
all
the
Jews
come
together
and
secret
spake
nothing
John
Why
askest
thou
ask
them
that
have
heard
what
spake
unto
them
behold
these
know
the
things
which
said
John
And
when
had
said
this
one
the
officers
standing
struck
Jesus
with
his
hand
saying
Answerest
thou
the
high
priest
John
Jesus
answered
him
have
spoken
evil
bear
witness
the
evil
but
well
why
smitest
thou
John
Annas
therefore
sent
him
bound
unto
Caiaphas
the
high
priest
John
Now
Simon
Peter
was
standing
and
warming
himself
They
said
therefore
unto
him
Art
thou
also
one
his
disciples
denied
and
said
not
John
One
the
servants
the
high
priest
being
kinsman
him
whose
ear
Peter
cut
off
saith
Did
not
see
thee
the
garden
with
him
John
Peter
therefore
denied
again
and
straightway
the
cock
crew
John
They
lead
Jesus
therefore
from
Caiaphas
into
the
Prætorium
and
was
early
and
they
themselves
entered
not
into
the
Prætorium
that
they
might
not
defiled
but
might
eat
the
passover
John
Pilate
therefore
went
out
unto
them
and
saith
What
accusation
bring
against
this
man
John
They
answered
and
said
unto
him
this
man
were
not
evildoer
should
not
have
delivered
him
unto
thee
John
Pilate
therefore
said
unto
them
Take
him
yourselves
and
judge
him
according
your
law
The
Jews
said
unto
him
not
lawful
for
put
any
man
death
John
that
the
word
Jesus
might
fulfilled
which
spake
signifying
what
manner
death
should
die
John
Pilate
therefore
entered
again
into
the
Prætorium
and
called
Jesus
and
said
unto
him
Art
thou
the
King
the
Jews
John
Jesus
answered
Sayest
thou
this
thyself
did
others
tell
thee
concerning
John
Pilate
answered
Jew
Thine
own
nation
and
the
chief
priests
delivered
thee
unto
what
hast
thou
done
John
Jesus
answered
kingdom
not
this
world
kingdom
were
this
world
then
would
servants
fight
that
should
not
delivered
the
Jews
but
now
kingdom
not
from
hence
John
Pilate
therefore
said
unto
him
Art
thou
king
then
Jesus
answered
Thou
sayest
that
king
this
end
have
been
born
and
this
end
come
into
the
world
that
should
bear
witness
unto
the
truth
Every
one
that
the
truth
heareth
voice
John
Pilate
saith
unto
him
What
truth
And
when
had
said
this
went
out
again
unto
the
Jews
and
saith
unto
them
find
crime
him
John
But
have
custom
that
should
release
unto
you
one
the
passover
will
therefore
that
release
unto
you
the
King
the
Jews
John
They
cried
out
therefore
again
saying
Not
this
man
but
Barabbas
Now
Barabbas
was
robber
John
Then
Pilate
therefore
took
Jesus
and
scourged
him
John
And
the
soldiers
platted
crown
thorns
and
put
his
head
and
arrayed
him
purple
garment
John
and
they
came
unto
him
and
said
Hail
King
the
Jews
and
they
struck
him
with
their
hands
John
And
Pilate
went
out
again
and
saith
unto
them
Behold
bring
him
out
you
that
may
know
that
find
crime
him
John
Jesus
therefore
came
out
wearing
the
crown
thorns
and
the
purple
garment
And
Pilate
saith
unto
them
Behold
the
man
John
When
therefore
the
chief
priests
and
the
officers
saw
him
they
cried
out
saying
Crucify
him
crucify
him
Pilate
saith
unto
them
Take
him
yourselves
and
crucify
him
for
find
crime
him
John
The
Jews
answered
him
have
law
and
that
law
ought
die
because
made
himself
the
Son
God
John
When
Pilate
therefore
heard
this
saying
was
the
more
afraid
John
and
entered
into
the
Prætorium
again
and
saith
unto
Jesus
Whence
art
thou
But
Jesus
gave
him
answer
John
Pilate
therefore
saith
unto
him
Speakest
thou
not
unto
knowest
thou
not
that
have
power
release
thee
and
have
power
crucify
thee
John
Jesus
answered
him
Thou
wouldest
have
power
against
except
were
given
thee
from
above
therefore
that
delivered
unto
thee
hath
greater
sin
John
Upon
this
Pilate
sought
release
him
but
the
Jews
cried
out
saying
thou
release
this
man
thou
art
not
Cæsar
friend
every
one
that
maketh
himself
king
speaketh
against
Cæsar
John
When
Pilate
therefore
heard
these
words
brought
Jesus
out
and
sat
down
the
judgment
seat
place
called
The
Pavement
but
Hebrew
Gabbatha
John
Now
was
the
Preparation
the
passover
was
about
the
sixth
hour
And
saith
unto
the
Jews
Behold
your
King
John
They
therefore
cried
out
Away
with
him
away
with
him
crucify
him
Pilate
saith
unto
them
Shall
crucify
your
King
The
chief
priests
answered
have
king
but
Cæsar
John
Then
therefore
delivered
him
unto
them
crucified
John
They
took
Jesus
therefore
and
went
out
bearing
the
cross
for
himself
unto
the
place
called
The
place
skull
which
called
Hebrew
Golgotha
John
where
they
crucified
him
and
with
him
two
others
either
side
one
and
Jesus
the
midst
John
And
Pilate
wrote
title
also
and
put
the
cross
And
there
was
written
JESUS
NAZARETH
THE
KING
THE
JEWS
John
This
title
therefore
read
many
the
Jews
for
the
place
where
Jesus
was
crucified
was
nigh
the
city
and
was
written
Hebrew
and
Latin
and
Greek
John
The
chief
priests
the
Jews
therefore
said
Pilate
Write
not
The
King
the
Jews
but
that
said
King
the
Jews
John
Pilate
answered
What
have
written
have
written
John
The
soldiers
therefore
when
they
had
crucified
Jesus
took
his
garments
and
made
four
parts
every
soldier
part
and
also
the
coat
now
the
coat
was
without
seam
woven
from
the
top
throughout
John
They
said
therefore
one
another
Let
not
rend
but
cast
lots
for
whose
shall
that
the
scripture
might
fulfilled
which
saith
They
parted
garments
among
them
And
upon
vesture
did
they
cast
lots
John
These
things
therefore
the
soldiers
did
But
there
were
standing
the
cross
Jesus
his
mother
and
his
mother
sister
Mary
the
wife
Clopas
and
Mary
Magdalene
John
When
Jesus
therefore
saw
his
mother
and
the
disciple
standing
whom
loved
saith
unto
his
mother
Woman
behold
thy
son
John
Then
saith
the
disciple
Behold
thy
mother
And
from
that
hour
the
disciple
took
her
unto
his
own
home
John
After
this
Jesus
knowing
that
all
things
are
now
finished
that
the
scripture
might
accomplished
saith
thirst
John
There
was
set
there
vessel
full
vinegar
they
put
sponge
full
the
vinegar
upon
hyssop
and
brought
his
mouth
John
When
Jesus
therefore
had
received
the
vinegar
said
finished
and
bowed
his
head
and
gave
his
spirit
John
The
Jews
therefore
because
was
the
Preparation
that
the
bodies
should
not
remain
the
cross
upon
the
sabbath
for
the
day
that
sabbath
was
high
day
asked
Pilate
that
their
legs
might
broken
and
that
they
might
taken
away
John
The
soldiers
therefore
came
and
brake
the
legs
the
first
and
the
other
that
was
crucified
with
him
John
but
when
they
came
Jesus
and
saw
that
was
dead
already
they
brake
not
his
legs
John
howbeit
one
the
soldiers
with
spear
pierced
his
side
and
straightway
there
came
out
blood
and
water
John
And
that
hath
seen
hath
borne
witness
and
his
witness
true
and
knoweth
that
saith
true
that
also
may
believe
John
For
these
things
came
pass
that
the
scripture
might
fulfilled
bone
him
shall
not
broken
John
And
again
another
scripture
saith
They
shall
look
him
whom
they
pierced
John
And
after
these
things
Joseph
Arimathæa
being
disciple
Jesus
but
secretly
for
fear
the
Jews
asked
Pilate
that
might
take
away
the
body
Jesus
and
Pilate
gave
him
leave
came
therefore
and
took
away
his
body
John
And
there
came
also
Nicodemus
who
the
first
came
him
night
bringing
mixture
myrrh
and
aloes
about
hundred
pounds
John
they
took
the
body
Jesus
and
bound
linen
cloths
with
the
spices
the
custom
the
Jews
bury
John
Now
the
place
where
was
crucified
there
was
garden
and
the
garden
new
tomb
wherein
was
never
man
yet
laid
John
There
then
because
the
Jews
Preparation
for
the
tomb
was
nigh
hand
they
laid
Jesus
John
Now
the
first
day
the
week
cometh
Mary
Magdalene
early
while
was
yet
dark
unto
the
tomb
and
seeth
the
stone
taken
away
from
the
tomb
John
She
runneth
therefore
and
cometh
Simon
Peter
and
the
other
disciple
whom
Jesus
loved
and
saith
unto
them
They
have
taken
away
the
Lord
out
the
tomb
and
know
not
where
they
have
laid
him
John
Peter
therefore
went
forth
and
the
other
disciple
and
they
went
toward
the
tomb
John
And
they
ran
both
together
and
the
other
disciple
outran
Peter
and
came
first
the
tomb
John
and
stooping
and
looking
seeth
the
linen
cloths
lying
yet
entered
not
John
Simon
Peter
therefore
also
cometh
following
him
and
entered
into
the
tomb
and
beholdeth
the
linen
cloths
lying
John
and
the
napkin
that
was
upon
his
head
not
lying
with
the
linen
cloths
but
rolled
place
itself
John
Then
entered
therefore
the
other
disciple
also
who
came
first
the
tomb
and
saw
and
believed
John
For
yet
they
knew
not
the
scripture
that
must
rise
again
from
the
dead
John
the
disciples
went
away
again
unto
their
own
home
John
But
Mary
was
standing
without
the
tomb
weeping
she
wept
she
stooped
and
looked
into
the
tomb
John
and
she
beholdeth
two
angels
white
sitting
one
the
head
and
one
the
feet
where
the
body
Jesus
had
lain
John
And
they
say
unto
her
Woman
why
weepest
thou
She
saith
unto
them
Because
they
have
taken
away
Lord
and
know
not
where
they
have
laid
him
John
When
she
had
thus
said
she
turned
herself
back
and
beholdeth
Jesus
standing
and
knew
not
that
was
Jesus
John
Jesus
saith
unto
her
Woman
why
weepest
thou
whom
seekest
thou
She
supposing
him
the
gardener
saith
unto
him
Sir
thou
hast
borne
him
hence
tell
where
thou
hast
laid
him
and
will
take
him
away
John
Jesus
saith
unto
her
Mary
She
turneth
herself
and
saith
unto
him
Hebrew
Rabboni
which
say
Teacher
John
Jesus
saith
her
Touch
not
for
not
yet
ascended
unto
the
Father
but
unto
brethren
and
say
them
ascend
unto
Father
and
your
Father
and
God
and
your
God
John
Mary
Magdalene
cometh
and
telleth
the
disciples
have
seen
the
Lord
and
that
had
said
these
things
unto
her
John
When
therefore
was
evening
that
day
the
first
day
the
week
and
when
the
doors
were
shut
where
the
disciples
were
for
fear
the
Jews
Jesus
came
and
stood
the
midst
and
saith
unto
them
Peace
unto
you
John
And
when
had
said
this
showed
unto
them
his
hands
and
his
side
The
disciples
therefore
were
glad
when
they
saw
the
Lord
John
Jesus
therefore
said
them
again
Peace
unto
you
the
Father
hath
sent
even
send
you
John
And
when
had
said
this
breathed
them
and
saith
unto
them
Receive
the
Holy
Spirit
John
whose
soever
sins
forgive
they
are
forgiven
unto
them
whose
soever
sins
retain
they
are
retained
John
But
Thomas
one
the
twelve
called
Didymus
was
not
with
them
when
Jesus
came
John
The
other
disciples
therefore
said
unto
him
have
seen
the
Lord
But
said
unto
them
Except
shall
see
his
hands
the
print
the
nails
and
put
finger
into
the
print
the
nails
and
put
hand
into
his
side
will
not
believe
John
And
after
eight
days
again
his
disciples
were
within
and
Thomas
with
them
Jesus
cometh
the
doors
being
shut
and
stood
the
midst
and
said
Peace
unto
you
John
Then
saith
Thomas
Reach
hither
thy
finger
and
see
hands
and
reach
hither
thy
hand
and
put
into
side
and
not
faithless
but
believing
John
Thomas
answered
and
said
unto
him
Lord
and
God
John
Jesus
saith
unto
him
Because
thou
hast
seen
thou
hast
believed
blessed
are
they
that
have
not
seen
and
yet
have
believed
John
Many
other
signs
therefore
did
Jesus
the
presence
the
disciples
which
are
not
written
this
book
John
but
these
are
written
that
may
believe
that
Jesus
the
Christ
the
Son
God
and
that
believing
may
have
life
his
name
John
After
these
things
Jesus
manifested
himself
again
the
disciples
the
sea
Tiberias
and
manifested
himself
this
wise
John
There
were
together
Simon
Peter
and
Thomas
called
Didymus
and
Nathanael
Cana
Galilee
and
the
sons
Zebedee
and
two
other
his
disciples
John
Simon
Peter
saith
unto
them
fishing
They
say
unto
him
also
come
with
thee
They
went
forth
and
entered
into
the
boat
and
that
night
they
took
nothing
John
But
when
day
was
now
breaking
Jesus
stood
the
beach
yet
the
disciples
knew
not
that
was
Jesus
John
Jesus
therefore
saith
unto
them
Children
have
aught
eat
They
answered
him
John
And
said
unto
them
Cast
the
net
the
right
side
the
boat
and
shall
find
They
cast
therefore
and
now
they
were
not
able
draw
for
the
multitude
fishes
John
That
disciple
therefore
whom
Jesus
loved
saith
unto
Peter
the
Lord
when
Simon
Peter
heard
that
was
the
Lord
girt
his
coat
about
him
for
was
naked
and
cast
himself
into
the
sea
John
But
the
other
disciples
came
the
little
boat
for
they
were
not
far
from
the
land
but
about
two
hundred
cubits
off
dragging
the
net
full
fishes
John
when
they
got
out
upon
the
land
they
see
fire
coals
there
and
fish
laid
thereon
and
bread
John
Jesus
saith
unto
them
Bring
the
fish
which
have
now
taken
John
Simon
Peter
therefore
went
and
drew
the
net
land
full
great
fishes
hundred
and
fifty
and
three
and
for
all
there
were
many
the
net
was
not
rent
John
Jesus
saith
unto
them
Come
and
break
your
fast
And
none
the
disciples
durst
inquire
him
Who
art
thou
knowing
that
was
the
Lord
John
Jesus
cometh
and
taketh
the
bread
and
giveth
them
and
the
fish
likewise
John
This
now
the
third
time
that
Jesus
was
manifested
the
disciples
after
that
was
risen
from
the
dead
John
when
they
had
broken
their
fast
Jesus
saith
Simon
Peter
Simon
son
John
lovest
thou
more
than
these
saith
unto
him
Yea
Lord
thou
knowest
that
love
thee
saith
unto
him
Feed
lambs
John
saith
him
again
second
time
Simon
son
John
lovest
thou
saith
unto
him
Yea
Lord
thou
knowest
that
love
thee
saith
unto
him
Tend
sheep
John
saith
unto
him
the
third
time
Simon
son
John
lovest
thou
Peter
was
grieved
because
said
unto
him
the
third
time
Lovest
thou
And
said
unto
him
Lord
thou
knowest
all
things
thou
knowest
that
love
thee
Jesus
saith
unto
him
Feed
sheep
John
Verily
verily
say
unto
thee
When
thou
wast
young
thou
girdedst
thyself
and
walkedst
whither
thou
wouldest
but
when
thou
shalt
old
thou
shalt
stretch
forth
thy
hands
and
another
shall
gird
thee
and
carry
thee
whither
thou
wouldest
not
John
Now
this
spake
signifying
what
manner
death
should
glorify
God
And
when
had
spoken
this
saith
unto
him
Follow
John
Peter
turning
about
seeth
the
disciple
whom
Jesus
loved
following
who
also
leaned
back
his
breast
the
supper
and
said
Lord
who
that
betrayeth
thee
John
Peter
therefore
seeing
him
saith
Jesus
Lord
and
what
shall
this
man
John
Jesus
saith
unto
him
will
that
tarry
till
come
what
that
thee
follow
thou
John
This
saying
therefore
went
forth
among
the
brethren
that
that
disciple
should
not
die
yet
Jesus
said
not
unto
him
that
should
not
die
but
will
that
tarry
till
come
what
that
thee
John
This
the
disciple
that
beareth
witness
these
things
and
wrote
these
things
and
know
that
his
witness
true
John
And
there
are
also
many
other
things
which
Jesus
did
the
which
they
should
written
every
one
suppose
that
even
the
world
itself
would
not
contain
the
books
that
should
written
Acts
The
former
treatise
made
Theophilus
concerning
all
that
Jesus
began
both
and
teach
Acts
until
the
day
which
was
received
after
that
had
given
commandment
through
the
Holy
Spirit
unto
the
apostles
whom
had
chosen
Acts
whom
also
showed
himself
alive
after
his
passion
many
proofs
appearing
unto
them
the
space
forty
days
and
speaking
the
things
concerning
the
kingdom
God
Acts
and
being
assembled
together
with
them
charged
them
not
depart
from
Jerusalem
but
wait
for
the
promise
the
Father
which
said
heard
from
Acts
for
John
indeed
baptized
with
water
but
shall
baptized
the
Holy
Spirit
not
many
days
hence
Acts
They
therefore
when
they
were
come
together
asked
him
saying
Lord
dost
thou
this
time
restore
the
kingdom
Israel
Acts
And
said
unto
them
not
for
you
know
times
seasons
which
the
Father
hath
set
within
His
own
authority
Acts
But
shall
receive
power
when
the
Holy
Spirit
come
upon
you
and
shall
witnesses
both
Jerusalem
and
all
Judæa
and
Samaria
and
unto
the
uttermost
part
the
earth
Acts
And
when
had
said
these
things
they
were
looking
was
taken
and
cloud
received
him
out
their
sight
Acts
And
while
they
were
looking
stedfastly
into
heaven
went
behold
two
men
stood
them
white
apparel
Acts
who
also
said
men
Galilee
why
stand
looking
into
heaven
this
Jesus
who
was
received
from
you
into
heaven
shall
come
like
manner
beheld
him
going
into
heaven
Acts
Then
returned
they
unto
Jerusalem
from
the
mount
called
Olivet
which
nigh
unto
Jerusalem
sabbath
day
journey
off
Acts
And
when
they
were
come
they
went
into
the
upper
chamber
where
they
were
abiding
both
Peter
and
John
and
James
and
Andrew
Philip
and
Thomas
Bartholomew
and
Matthew
James
the
son
Alphæus
and
Simon
the
Zealot
and
Judas
the
son
James
Acts
These
all
with
one
accord
continued
stedfastly
prayer
with
the
women
and
Mary
the
mother
Jesus
and
with
his
brethren
Acts
And
these
days
Peter
stood
the
midst
the
brethren
and
said
and
there
was
multitude
persons
gathered
together
about
hundred
and
twenty
Acts
Brethren
was
needful
that
the
scripture
should
fulfilled
which
the
Holy
Spirit
spake
before
the
mouth
David
concerning
Judas
who
was
guide
them
that
took
Jesus
Acts
For
was
numbered
among
and
received
his
portion
this
ministry
Acts
Now
this
man
obtained
field
with
the
reward
his
iniquity
and
falling
headlong
burst
asunder
the
midst
and
all
his
bowels
gushed
out
Acts
And
became
known
all
the
dwellers
Jerusalem
insomuch
that
their
language
that
field
was
called
Akeldama
that
The
field
blood
Acts
For
written
the
book
Psalms
Let
his
habitation
made
desolate
And
let
man
dwell
therein
and
His
office
let
another
take
Acts
the
men
therefore
that
have
companied
with
all
the
time
that
the
Lord
Jesus
went
and
went
out
among
Acts
beginning
from
the
baptism
John
unto
the
day
that
was
received
from
these
must
one
become
witness
with
his
resurrection
Acts
And
they
put
forward
two
Joseph
called
Barsabbas
who
was
surnamed
Justus
and
Matthias
Acts
And
they
prayed
and
said
Thou
Lord
who
knowest
the
hearts
all
men
show
these
two
the
one
whom
thou
hast
chosen
Acts
take
the
place
this
ministry
and
apostleship
from
which
Judas
fell
away
that
might
his
own
place
Acts
And
they
gave
lots
for
them
and
the
lot
fell
upon
Matthias
and
was
numbered
with
the
eleven
apostles
Acts
And
when
the
day
Pentecost
was
now
come
they
were
all
together
one
place
Acts
And
suddenly
there
came
from
heaven
sound
the
rushing
mighty
wind
and
filled
all
the
house
where
they
were
sitting
Acts
And
there
appeared
unto
them
tongues
parting
asunder
like
fire
and
sat
upon
each
one
them
Acts
And
they
were
all
filled
with
the
Holy
Spirit
and
began
speak
with
other
tongues
the
Spirit
gave
them
utterance
Acts
Now
there
were
dwelling
Jerusalem
Jews
devout
men
from
every
nation
under
heaven
Acts
And
when
this
sound
was
heard
the
multitude
came
together
and
were
confounded
because
that
every
man
heard
them
speaking
his
own
language
Acts
And
they
were
all
amazed
and
marvelled
saying
Behold
are
not
all
these
that
speak
Galilæans
Acts
And
how
hear
every
man
our
own
language
wherein
were
born
Acts
Parthians
and
Medes
and
Elamites
and
the
dwellers
Mesopotamia
Judæa
and
Cappadocia
Pontus
and
Asia
Acts
Phrygia
and
Pamphylia
Egypt
and
the
parts
Libya
about
Cyrene
and
sojourners
from
Rome
both
Jews
and
proselytes
Acts
Cretans
and
Arabians
hear
them
speaking
our
tongues
the
mighty
works
God
Acts
And
they
were
all
amazed
and
were
perplexed
saying
one
another
What
meaneth
this
Acts
But
others
mocking
said
They
are
filled
with
new
wine
Acts
But
Peter
standing
with
the
eleven
lifted
his
voice
and
spake
forth
unto
them
saying
men
Judæa
and
all
that
dwell
Jerusalem
this
known
unto
you
and
give
ear
unto
words
Acts
For
these
are
not
drunken
suppose
seeing
but
the
third
hour
the
day
Acts
but
this
that
which
hath
been
spoken
through
the
prophet
Joel
Acts
And
shall
the
last
days
saith
God
will
pour
forth
Spirit
upon
all
flesh
And
your
sons
and
your
daughters
shall
prophesy
And
your
young
men
shall
see
visions
And
your
old
men
shall
dream
dreams
Acts
Yea
and
servants
and
handmaidens
those
days
Will
pour
forth
Spirit
and
they
shall
prophesy
Acts
And
will
show
wonders
the
heaven
above
And
signs
the
earth
beneath
Blood
and
fire
and
vapor
smoke
Acts
The
sun
shall
turned
into
darkness
And
the
moon
into
blood
Before
the
day
the
Lord
come
That
great
and
notable
day
Acts
And
shall
that
whosoever
shall
call
the
name
the
Lord
shall
saved
Acts
men
Israel
hear
these
words
Jesus
Nazareth
man
approved
God
unto
you
mighty
works
and
wonders
and
signs
which
God
did
him
the
midst
you
even
yourselves
know
Acts
him
being
delivered
the
determinate
counsel
and
foreknowledge
God
the
hand
lawless
men
did
crucify
and
slay
Acts
whom
God
raised
having
loosed
the
pangs
death
because
was
not
possible
that
should
holden
Acts
For
David
saith
concerning
him
beheld
the
Lord
always
before
face
For
right
hand
that
should
not
moved
Acts
Therefore
heart
was
glad
and
tongue
rejoiced
Moreover
flesh
also
shall
dwell
hope
Acts
Because
thou
wilt
not
leave
soul
unto
Hades
Neither
wilt
thou
give
thy
Holy
One
see
corruption
Acts
Thou
madest
known
unto
the
ways
life
Thou
shalt
make
full
gladness
with
thy
countenance
Acts
Brethren
may
say
unto
you
freely
the
patriarch
David
that
both
died
and
was
buried
and
his
tomb
with
unto
this
day
Acts
Being
therefore
prophet
and
knowing
that
God
had
sworn
with
oath
him
that
the
fruit
his
loins
would
set
one
upon
his
throne
Acts
foreseeing
this
spake
the
resurrection
the
Christ
that
neither
was
left
unto
Hades
nor
did
his
flesh
see
corruption
Acts
This
Jesus
did
God
raise
whereof
all
are
witnesses
Acts
Being
therefore
the
right
hand
God
exalted
and
having
received
the
Father
the
promise
the
Holy
Spirit
hath
poured
forth
this
which
see
and
hear
Acts
For
David
ascended
not
into
the
heavens
but
saith
himself
The
Lord
said
unto
Lord
Sit
thou
right
hand
Acts
Till
make
thine
enemies
the
footstool
thy
feet
Acts
Let
all
the
house
Israel
therefore
know
assuredly
that
God
hath
made
himboth
Lord
and
Christ
this
Jesus
whom
crucified
Acts
Now
when
they
heard
this
they
were
pricked
their
heart
and
said
unto
Peter
and
the
rest
the
apostles
Brethren
what
shall
Acts
And
Peter
said
unto
them
Repent
and
baptized
every
one
you
the
name
Jesus
Christ
unto
the
remission
your
sins
and
shall
receive
the
gift
the
Holy
Spirit
Acts
For
you
the
promise
and
your
children
and
all
that
are
afar
off
even
many
the
Lord
our
God
shall
call
unto
him
Acts
And
with
many
other
words
testified
and
exhorted
them
saying
Save
yourselves
from
this
crooked
generation
Acts
They
then
that
received
his
word
were
baptized
and
there
were
added
unto
them
that
day
about
three
thousand
souls
Acts
And
they
continued
stedfastly
the
apostles
teaching
and
fellowship
the
breaking
bread
and
the
prayers
Acts
And
fear
came
upon
every
soul
and
many
wonders
and
signs
were
done
through
the
apostles
Acts
And
all
that
believed
were
together
and
had
all
things
common
Acts
and
they
sold
their
possessions
and
goods
and
parted
them
all
according
any
man
had
need
Acts
And
day
day
continuing
stedfastly
with
one
accord
the
temple
and
breaking
bread
home
they
took
their
food
with
gladness
and
singleness
heart
Acts
praising
God
and
having
favor
with
all
the
people
And
the
Lord
added
them
day
day
those
that
were
saved
Acts
Now
Peter
and
John
were
going
into
the
temple
the
hour
prayer
being
the
ninth
hour
Acts
And
certain
man
that
was
lame
from
his
mother
womb
was
carried
whom
they
laid
daily
the
door
the
temple
which
called
Beautiful
ask
alms
them
that
entered
into
the
temple
Acts
who
seeing
Peter
and
John
about
into
the
temple
asked
receive
alms
Acts
And
Peter
fastening
his
eyes
upon
him
with
John
said
Look
Acts
And
gave
heed
unto
them
expecting
receive
something
from
them
Acts
But
Peter
said
Silver
and
gold
have
none
but
what
have
that
give
thee
the
name
Jesus
Christ
Nazareth
walk
Acts
And
took
him
the
right
hand
and
raised
him
and
immediately
his
feet
and
his
ankle
bones
received
strength
Acts
And
leaping
stood
and
began
walk
and
entered
with
them
into
the
temple
walking
and
leaping
and
praising
God
Acts
And
all
the
people
saw
him
walking
and
praising
God
Acts
and
they
took
knowledge
him
that
was
that
sat
for
alms
the
Beautiful
Gate
the
temple
and
they
were
filled
with
wonder
and
amazement
that
which
had
happened
unto
him
Acts
And
held
Peter
and
John
all
the
people
ran
together
unto
them
the
porch
that
called
Solomon
greatly
wondering
Acts
And
when
Peter
saw
answered
unto
the
people
men
Israel
why
marvel
this
man
why
fasten
your
eyes
though
our
own
power
godliness
had
made
him
walk
Acts
The
God
Abraham
and
Isaac
and
Jacob
the
God
our
fathers
hath
glorified
his
Servant
Jesus
whom
delivered
and
denied
before
the
face
Pilate
when
had
determined
release
him
Acts
But
denied
the
Holy
and
Righteous
One
and
asked
for
murderer
granted
unto
you
Acts
and
killed
the
Prince
life
whom
God
raised
from
the
dead
whereof
are
witnesses
Acts
And
faith
his
name
hath
his
name
made
this
man
strong
whom
behold
and
know
yea
the
faith
which
through
him
hath
given
him
this
perfect
soundness
the
presence
you
all
Acts
And
now
brethren
know
that
ignorance
did
did
also
your
rulers
Acts
But
the
things
which
God
foreshowed
the
mouth
all
the
prophets
that
his
Christ
should
suffer
thus
fulfilled
Acts
Repent
therefore
and
turn
again
that
your
sins
may
blotted
out
that
there
may
come
seasons
refreshing
from
the
presence
the
Lord
Acts
and
that
may
send
the
Christ
who
hath
been
appointed
for
you
even
Jesus
Acts
whom
the
heaven
must
receive
until
the
times
restoration
all
things
whereof
God
spake
the
mouth
His
holy
prophets
that
have
been
from
old
Acts
Moses
indeed
said
prophet
shall
the
Lord
God
raise
unto
you
from
among
your
brethren
like
unto
him
shall
hearken
all
things
whatsoever
shall
speak
unto
you
Acts
And
shall
that
every
soul
that
shall
not
hearken
that
prophet
shall
utterly
destroyed
from
among
the
people
Acts
Yea
and
all
the
prophets
from
Samuel
and
them
that
followed
after
many
have
spoken
they
also
told
these
days
Acts
are
the
sons
the
prophets
and
the
covenant
which
God
made
with
your
fathers
saying
unto
Abraham
And
thy
seed
shall
all
the
families
the
earth
blessed
Acts
Unto
you
first
God
having
raised
his
Servant
sent
him
bless
you
turning
away
every
one
you
from
your
iniquities
Acts
And
they
spake
unto
the
people
the
priests
and
the
captain
the
temple
and
the
Sadducees
came
upon
them
Acts
being
sore
troubled
because
they
taught
the
people
and
proclaimed
Jesus
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
Acts
And
they
laid
hands
them
and
put
them
ward
unto
the
morrow
for
was
now
eventide
Acts
But
many
them
that
heard
the
word
believed
and
the
number
the
men
came
about
five
thousand
Acts
And
came
pass
the
morrow
that
their
rulers
and
elders
and
scribes
were
gathered
together
Jerusalem
Acts
and
Annas
the
high
priest
was
there
and
Caiaphas
and
John
and
Alexander
and
many
were
the
kindred
the
high
priest
Acts
And
when
they
had
set
them
the
midst
they
inquired
what
power
what
name
have
done
this
Acts
Then
Peter
filled
with
the
Holy
Spirit
said
unto
them
rulers
the
people
and
elders
Acts
this
day
are
examined
concerning
good
deed
done
impotent
man
what
means
this
man
made
whole
Acts
known
unto
you
all
and
all
the
people
Israel
that
the
name
Jesus
Christ
Nazareth
whom
crucified
whom
God
raised
from
the
dead
even
him
doth
this
man
stand
here
before
you
whole
Acts
the
stone
which
was
set
nought
you
the
builders
which
was
made
the
head
the
corner
Acts
And
none
other
there
salvation
for
neither
there
any
other
name
under
heaven
that
given
among
men
wherein
must
saved
Acts
Now
when
they
beheld
the
boldness
Peter
and
John
and
had
perceived
that
they
were
unlearned
and
ignorant
men
they
marvelled
and
they
took
knowledge
them
that
they
had
been
with
Jesus
Acts
And
seeing
the
man
that
was
healed
standing
with
them
they
could
say
nothing
against
Acts
But
when
they
had
commanded
them
aside
out
the
council
they
conferred
among
themselves
Acts
saying
What
shall
these
men
for
that
indeed
notable
miracle
hath
been
wrought
through
them
manifest
all
that
dwell
Jerusalem
and
cannot
deny
Acts
But
that
spread
further
among
the
people
let
threaten
them
that
they
speak
henceforth
man
this
name
Acts
And
they
called
them
and
charged
them
not
speak
all
nor
teach
the
name
Jesus
Acts
But
Peter
and
John
answered
and
said
unto
them
Whether
right
the
sight
God
hearken
unto
you
rather
than
unto
God
judge
Acts
for
cannot
but
speak
the
things
which
saw
and
heard
Acts
And
they
when
they
had
further
threatened
them
let
them
finding
nothing
how
they
might
punish
them
because
the
people
for
all
men
glorified
God
for
that
which
was
done
Acts
For
the
man
was
more
than
forty
years
old
whom
this
miracle
healing
was
wrought
Acts
And
being
let
they
came
their
own
company
and
reported
all
that
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
had
said
unto
them
Acts
And
they
when
they
heard
lifted
their
voice
God
with
one
accord
and
said
Lord
thou
that
didst
make
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
that
them
Acts
who
the
Holy
Spirit
the
mouth
our
father
David
thy
servant
didst
say
Why
did
the
Gentiles
rage
And
the
peoples
imagine
vain
things
Acts
The
kings
the
earth
set
themselves
array
And
the
rulers
were
gathered
together
Against
the
Lord
and
against
his
Anointed
Acts
for
truth
this
city
against
thy
holy
Servant
Jesus
whom
thou
didst
anoint
both
Herod
and
Pontius
Pilate
with
the
Gentiles
and
the
peoples
Israel
were
gathered
together
Acts
whatsoever
thy
hand
and
thy
council
foreordained
come
pass
Acts
And
now
Lord
look
upon
their
threatenings
and
grant
unto
thy
servants
speak
thy
word
with
all
boldness
Acts
while
thy
stretchest
forth
thy
hand
heal
and
that
signs
and
wonders
may
done
through
the
name
thy
holy
Servant
Jesus
Acts
And
when
they
had
prayed
the
place
was
shaken
wherein
they
were
gathered
together
and
they
were
all
filled
with
the
Holy
Spirit
and
they
spake
the
word
God
with
boldness
Acts
And
the
multitude
them
that
believed
were
one
heart
and
soul
and
not
one
them
said
that
aught
the
things
which
possessed
was
his
own
but
they
had
all
things
common
Acts
And
with
great
power
gave
the
apostles
their
witness
the
resurrection
the
Lord
Jesus
and
great
grace
was
upon
them
all
Acts
For
neither
was
there
among
them
any
that
lacked
for
many
were
possessors
lands
houses
sold
them
and
brought
the
prices
the
things
that
were
sold
Acts
and
laid
them
the
apostles
feet
and
distribution
was
made
unto
each
according
any
one
had
need
Acts
And
Joseph
who
the
apostles
was
surnamed
Barnabas
which
being
interpreted
Son
exhortation
Levite
man
Cyprus
race
Acts
having
field
sold
and
brought
the
money
and
laid
the
apostles
feet
Acts
But
certain
man
named
Ananias
with
Sapphira
his
wife
sold
possession
Acts
and
kept
back
part
the
price
his
wife
also
being
privy
and
brought
certain
part
and
laid
the
apostles
feet
Acts
But
Peter
said
Ananias
why
hath
Satan
filled
thy
heart
lie
the
Holy
Spirit
and
keep
back
part
the
price
the
land
Acts
While
remained
did
not
remain
thine
own
and
after
was
sold
was
not
thy
power
How
that
thou
hast
conceived
this
thing
thy
heart
thou
has
not
lied
unto
men
but
unto
God
Acts
And
Ananias
hearing
these
words
fell
down
and
gave
the
ghost
and
great
fear
came
upon
all
that
heard
Acts
And
the
young
men
arose
and
wrapped
him
round
and
they
carried
him
out
and
buried
him
Acts
And
was
about
the
space
three
hours
after
when
his
wife
not
knowing
what
was
done
came
Acts
And
Peter
answered
unto
her
Tell
whether
sold
the
land
for
much
And
she
said
Yea
for
much
Acts
But
Peter
said
unto
her
How
that
have
agreed
together
try
the
Spirit
the
Lord
behold
the
feet
them
that
have
buried
thy
husband
are
the
door
and
they
shall
carry
thee
out
Acts
And
she
fell
down
immediately
his
feet
and
gave
the
ghost
and
the
young
men
came
and
found
her
dead
and
they
carried
her
out
and
buried
her
her
husband
Acts
And
great
fear
came
upon
the
whole
church
and
upon
all
that
heard
these
things
Acts
And
the
hands
the
apostles
were
many
signs
and
wonders
wrought
among
the
people
and
they
were
all
with
one
accord
Solomon
porch
Acts
But
the
rest
durst
man
join
himself
them
howbeit
the
people
magnified
them
Acts
and
believers
were
the
more
added
the
Lord
multitudes
both
men
and
women
Acts
insomuch
that
they
even
carried
out
the
sick
into
the
streets
and
laid
them
beds
and
couches
that
Peter
came
the
least
his
shadow
might
overshadow
some
one
them
Acts
And
there
also
came
together
the
multitudes
from
the
cities
round
about
Jerusalem
bringing
sick
folk
and
them
that
were
vexed
with
unclean
spirits
and
they
were
healed
every
one
Acts
But
the
high
priest
rose
and
all
they
that
were
with
him
which
the
sect
the
Sadducees
and
they
were
filled
with
jealousy
Acts
and
laid
hands
the
apostles
and
put
them
public
ward
Acts
But
angel
the
Lord
night
opened
the
prison
doors
and
brought
them
out
and
said
Acts
and
stand
and
speak
the
temple
the
people
all
the
words
this
Life
Acts
And
when
they
heard
this
they
entered
into
the
temple
about
daybreak
and
taught
But
the
high
priest
came
and
they
that
were
with
him
and
called
the
council
together
and
all
the
senate
the
children
Israel
and
sent
the
prison
house
have
them
brought
Acts
But
the
officers
that
came
found
them
not
the
prison
and
they
returned
and
told
Acts
saying
The
prison
house
found
shut
all
safety
and
the
keepers
standing
the
doors
but
when
had
opened
found
man
within
Acts
Now
when
the
captain
the
temple
and
the
chief
priests
heard
these
words
they
were
much
perplexed
concerning
them
whereunto
this
would
grow
Acts
And
there
came
one
and
told
them
Behold
the
men
whom
put
the
prison
are
the
temple
standing
and
teaching
the
people
Acts
Then
went
the
captain
with
the
officers
and
brought
them
but
without
violence
for
they
feared
the
people
lest
they
should
stoned
Acts
And
when
they
had
brought
them
they
set
them
before
the
council
And
the
high
priest
asked
them
Acts
saying
strictly
charged
you
not
teach
this
name
and
behold
have
filled
Jerusalem
with
your
teaching
and
intend
bring
this
man
blood
upon
Acts
But
Peter
and
the
apostles
answered
and
said
must
obey
God
rather
than
men
Acts
The
God
our
fathers
raised
Jesus
whom
slew
hanging
him
tree
Acts
Him
did
God
exalt
with
his
right
hand
Prince
and
Saviour
give
repentance
Israel
and
remission
sins
Acts
And
are
witnesses
these
things
and
the
Holy
Spirit
whom
God
hath
given
them
that
obey
him
Acts
But
they
when
they
heard
this
were
cut
the
heart
and
minded
slay
them
Acts
But
there
stood
one
the
council
Pharisee
named
Gamaliel
doctor
the
law
had
honor
all
the
people
and
commanded
put
the
men
forth
little
while
Acts
And
said
unto
them
men
Israel
take
heed
yourselves
touching
these
men
what
are
about
Acts
For
before
these
days
rose
Theudas
giving
himself
out
somebody
whom
number
men
about
four
hundred
joined
themselves
who
was
slain
and
all
many
obeyed
him
were
dispersed
and
came
nought
Acts
After
this
man
rose
Judas
Galilee
the
days
the
enrolment
and
drew
away
some
the
people
after
him
also
perished
and
all
many
obeyed
him
were
scattered
abroad
Acts
And
now
say
unto
you
Refrain
from
these
men
and
let
them
alone
for
this
counsel
this
work
men
will
overthrown
Acts
but
God
will
not
able
overthrow
them
lest
haply
found
even
fighting
against
God
Acts
And
him
they
agreed
and
when
they
had
called
the
apostles
unto
them
they
beat
them
and
charged
them
not
speak
the
name
Jesus
and
let
them
Acts
They
therefore
departed
from
the
presence
the
council
rejoicing
that
they
were
counted
worthy
suffer
dishonor
for
the
Name
Acts
And
every
day
the
temple
and
home
they
ceased
not
teach
and
preach
Jesus
the
Christ
Acts
Now
these
days
when
the
number
the
disciples
was
multiplying
there
arose
murmuring
the
Grecian
Jews
against
the
Hebrews
because
their
widows
were
neglected
the
daily
ministration
Acts
And
the
twelve
called
the
multitude
the
disciples
unto
them
and
said
not
fit
that
should
forsake
the
word
God
and
serve
tables
Acts
Look
out
therefore
brethren
from
among
you
seven
men
good
report
full
the
Spirit
and
wisdom
whom
may
appoint
over
this
business
Acts
But
will
continue
stedfastly
prayer
and
the
ministry
the
word
Acts
And
the
saying
pleased
the
whole
multitude
and
they
chose
Stephen
man
full
faith
and
the
Holy
Spirit
and
Philip
and
Prochorus
and
Nicanor
and
Timon
and
Parmenas
and
Nicolaus
proselyte
Antioch
Acts
whom
they
set
before
the
apostles
and
when
they
had
prayed
they
laid
their
hands
upon
them
Acts
And
the
word
God
increased
and
the
number
the
disciples
multiplied
Jerusalem
exceedingly
and
great
company
the
priests
were
obedient
the
faith
Acts
And
Stephen
full
grace
and
power
wrought
great
wonders
and
signs
among
the
people
Acts
But
there
arose
certain
them
that
were
the
synagogue
called
the
synagogue
the
Libertines
and
the
Cyrenians
and
the
Alexandrians
and
them
Cilicia
and
Asia
disputing
with
Stephen
Acts
And
they
were
not
able
withstand
the
wisdom
and
the
Spirit
which
spake
Acts
Then
they
suborned
men
who
said
have
heard
him
speak
blasphemous
words
against
Moses
and
against
God
Acts
And
they
stirred
the
people
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes
and
came
upon
him
and
seized
him
and
brought
him
into
the
council
Acts
and
set
false
witnesses
who
said
This
man
ceaseth
not
speak
words
against
this
holy
place
and
the
law
Acts
for
have
heard
him
say
that
this
Jesus
Nazareth
shall
destroy
this
place
and
shall
change
the
customs
which
Moses
delivered
unto
Acts
And
all
that
sat
the
council
fastening
their
eyes
him
saw
his
face
had
been
the
face
angel
Acts
And
the
high
priest
said
Are
these
things
Acts
And
said
Brethren
and
fathers
hearken
The
God
glory
appeared
unto
our
father
Abraham
when
was
Mesopotamia
before
dwelt
Haran
Acts
and
said
unto
him
Get
thee
out
thy
land
and
from
thy
kindred
and
come
into
the
land
which
shall
show
thee
Acts
Then
came
out
the
land
the
Chaldæans
and
dwelt
Haran
and
from
thence
when
his
father
was
dead
God
removed
him
into
this
land
wherein
now
dwell
Acts
and
gave
him
none
inheritance
not
much
set
his
foot
and
promised
that
would
give
him
possession
and
his
seed
after
him
when
yet
had
child
Acts
And
God
spake
this
wise
that
his
seed
should
sojourn
strange
land
and
that
they
should
bring
them
into
bondage
and
treat
them
ill
four
hundred
years
Acts
And
the
nation
which
they
shall
bondage
will
judge
said
God
and
after
that
shall
they
come
forth
and
serve
this
place
Acts
And
gave
him
the
covenant
circumcision
and
Abraham
begat
Isaac
and
circumcised
him
the
eighth
day
and
Isaac
begat
Jacob
and
Jacob
the
twelve
patriarchs
Acts
And
the
patriarchs
moved
with
jealousy
against
Joseph
sold
him
into
Egypt
and
God
was
with
him
Acts
and
delivered
him
out
all
his
afflictions
and
gave
him
favor
and
wisdom
before
Pharaoh
king
Egypt
and
made
him
governor
over
Egypt
and
all
his
house
Acts
Now
there
came
famine
over
all
Egypt
and
Canaan
and
great
affliction
and
our
fathers
found
sustenance
Acts
But
when
Jacob
heard
that
there
was
grain
Egypt
sent
forth
our
fathers
the
first
time
Acts
And
the
second
time
Joseph
was
made
known
his
brethren
and
Joseph
race
became
manifest
unto
Pharaoh
Acts
And
Joseph
sent
and
called
him
Jacob
his
father
and
all
his
kindred
threescore
and
fifteen
souls
Acts
And
Jacob
went
down
into
Egypt
and
died
himself
and
our
fathers
Acts
and
they
were
carried
over
unto
Shechem
and
laid
the
tomb
that

bought

But
the
time
the
promise
drew
nigh
which
God
vouchsafed
unto
Abraham
the
people
grew
and
multiplied
Egypt
Acts
till
there
arose
another
king
over
Egypt
who
knew
not
Joseph
Acts
The
same
dealt
craftily
with
our
race
and
ill
treated
our
fathers
that
they
should
cast
out
their
babes
the
end
they
might
not
live
Acts
which
season
Moses
was
born
and
was
exceeding
fair
and
was
nourished
three
months
his
father
house
Acts
and
when
was
cast
out
Pharaoh
daughter
took
him
and
nourished
him
for
her
own
son
Acts
And
Moses
was
instructed
all
the
wisdom
the
Egyptians
and
was
mighty
his
words
and
works
Acts
But
when
was
well
nigh
forty
years
old
came
into
his
heart
visit
his
brethren
the
children
Israel
Acts
And
seeing
one
them
suffer
wrong
defended
him
and
avenged
him
that
was
oppressed
smiting
the
Egyptian
Acts
and
supposed
that
his
brethren
understood
that
God
his
hand
was
giving
them
deliverance
but
they
understood
not
Acts
And
the
day
following
appeared
unto
them
they
strove
and
would
have
set
them
one
again
saying
Sirs
are
brethren
why
wrong
one
another
Acts
But
that
did
his
neighbor
wrong
thrust
him
away
saying
Who
made
thee
ruler
and
judge
over
Acts
Wouldest
thou
kill
thou
killedst
the
Egyptian
yesterday
Acts
And
Moses
fled
this
saying
and
became
sojourner
the
land
Midian
where
begat
two
sons
Acts
And
when
forty
years
were
fulfilled
angel
appeared
him

And
when
Moses
saw
wondered
the
sight
and
drew
near
behold
there
came
voice
the
Lord
Acts
the
God
thy
fathers
the
God
Abraham
and
Isaac
and
Jacob
And
Moses
trembled
and
durst
not
behold
Acts
And
the
Lord
said
unto
him
Loose
the
shoes
from
thy
feet
for
the
place
whereon
thou
standest
holy
ground
Acts
have
surely
seen
the
affliction

that
Egypt
and
have
heard
their
groaning
and
come
down
deliver
them
and
now
come
will
send
thee
into
Egypt
Acts
This
Moses
whom
they
refused
saying
Who
made
thee
ruler
and
judge
him
hath
God
sent
both
ruler
and
deliverer
with
the
hand
the
angel
that
appeared
him
the
bush
Acts
This
man
led
them
forth
having
wrought
wonders
and
signs
Egypt
and
the
Red
Sea
and
the
wilderness

years
Acts
This
that
Moses
who
said
unto
the
children
Israel

shall
God
raise
unto
you
from
among
your
brethren
like
unto
Acts
This
that
was

Mount
Sinai
and
with
our
fathers
who
received
living
oracles
give
unto
Acts
whom
our
fathers
would
not
obedient
but
thrust
him
from
them
and
turned
back
their
hearts
unto
Egypt
Acts
saying
unto
Aaron
Make
gods
that
shall
before
for
for
this
Moses
who
led
forth
out
the
land
Egypt

not
what

him
Acts
And
they
made
calf
those
days
and
brought
sacrifice
unto
the
idol
and
rejoiced
the
works
their
hands
Acts
But
God
turned
and
gave
them
serve
the
host

the
book
the
prophets
Did
offer
unto
slain
beasts
and
sacrifices
Forty
years
the
wilderness

Israel
Acts
And
took
the
tabernacle
Moloch
And
the
star
the
god
Rephan
The
figures
which
made
worship
them
And
will
carry
you
away
beyond
Babylon
Acts
Our
fathers
had
the
tabernacle
the
testimony
the
wilderness
even
appointed
who
spake
unto
Moses
that
should
make
according
the
figure
that
had
seen
Acts
Which
also
our
fathers
their
turn
brought
with
Joshua
when
they
entered
the
possession
the
nations
that
God
thrust
out
before
the
face
our
fathers
unto
the
days
David
Acts
who
found
favor
the
sight
God
and
asked
find
habitation
for
the
God
Jacob
Acts
But
Solomon
built
him
house
Acts
Howbeit
the
Most
High
dwelleth
not
houses
made
with

saith
the
prophet
Acts
The

And

earth
the
footstool

What
manner
house
will
build
saith
the
Lord
what
the
place

Acts
Did
not
hand
make
all
these
things
Acts
stiffnecked
and
uncircumcised
heart
and
ears
always
resist
the
Holy
Spirit
your
fathers
did
Acts
Which
the
prophets
did
not
your
fathers
persecute
and
they
killed
them
that
showed
before
the
coming
the
Righteous
One
whom
have
now
become
betrayers
and
murderers
Acts
who
received
the
law
was
ordained
angels
and
kept
not
Acts
Now
when
they
heard
these
things
they
were
cut
the
heart
and
they
gnashed
him
with
their
teeth
Acts
But
being
full
the
Holy
Spirit
looked
stedfastly
into
heaven
and
saw
the
glory
God
and
Jesus
standing
the
right
hand
God
Acts
and
said
Behold
see
the
heavens
opened
and
the
Son
Man
standing
the
right
hand
God
Acts
But
they
cried
out
with
loud
voice
and
stopped
their
ears
and
rushed
upon
him
with
one
accord
Acts
and
they
cast
him
out
the
city
and
stoned
him
and
the
witnesses
laid
down
their
garments
the
feet
young
man
named
Saul
Acts
And
they
stoned
Stephen
calling
upon
the
Lord
and
saying
Lord
Jesus
receive
spirit
Acts
And
kneeled
down
and
cried
with
loud
voice
Lord
lay
not
this
sin
their
charge
And
when
had
said
this
fell
asleep
Acts
And
Saul
was
consenting
unto
his
death
And
there
arose
that
day
great
persecution
against
the
church
which
was
Jerusalem
and
they
were
all
scattered
abroad
throughout
the
regions
Judæa
and
Samaria
except
the
apostles
Acts
And
devout
men
buried
Stephen
and
made
great
lamentation
over
him
Acts
But
Saul
laid
waste
the
church
entering
into
every
house
and
dragging
men
and
women
committed
them
prison
Acts
They
therefore
that
were
scattered
abroad
went
about
preaching
the
word
Acts
And
Philip
went
down
the
city
Samaria
and
proclaimed
unto
them
the
Christ
Acts
And
the
multitudes
gave
heed
with
one
accord
unto
the
things
that
were
spoken
Philip
when
they
heard
and
saw
the
signs
which
did
Acts
For
from
many
those
that
had
unclean
spirits
they
came
out
crying
with
loud
voice
and
many
that
were
palsied
and
that
were
lame
were
healed
Acts
And
there
was
much
joy
that
city
Acts
But
there
was
certain
man
Simon
name
who
beforetime
the
city
used
sorcery
and
amazed
the
people
Samaria
giving
out
that
himself
was
some
great
one
Acts
whom
they
all
gave
heed
from
the
least
the
greatest
saying
This
man
that
power
God
which
called
Great
Acts
And
they
gave
heed
him
because
that
long
time
had
amazed
them
with
his
sorceries
Acts
But
when
they
believed
Philip
preaching
good
tidings
concerning
the
kingdom
God
and
the
name
Jesus
Christ
they
were
baptized
both
men
and
women
Acts
And
Simon
also
himself
believed
and
being
baptized
continued
with
Philip
and
beholding
signs
and
great
miracles
wrought
was
amazed
Acts
Now
when
the
apostles
that
were
Jerusalem
heard
that
Samaria
had
received
the
word
God
they
sent
unto
them
Peter
and
John
Acts
who
when
they
were
come
down
prayed
for
them
that
they
might
receive
the
Holy
Spirit
Acts
for
yet
was
fallen
upon
none
them
only
they
had
been
baptized
into
the
name
the
Lord
Jesus
Acts
Then
laid
they
their
hands
them
and
they
received
the
Holy
Spirit
Acts
Now
when
Simon
saw
that
through
the
laying
the
apostles
hands
the
Holy
Spirit
was
given
offered
them
money
Acts
saying
Give
also
this
power
that
whomsoever
lay
hands
may
receive
the
Holy
Spirit
Acts
But
Peter
said
unto
him
Thy
silver
perish
with
thee
because
thou
hast
thought
obtain
the
gift
God
with
money
Acts
Thou
hast
neither
part
nor
lot
this
matter
for
thy
heart
not
right
before
God
Acts
Repent
therefore
this
thy
wickedness
and
pray
the
Lord
perhaps
the
thought
thy
heart
shall
forgiven
thee
Acts
For
see
that
thou
art
the
gall
bitterness
and
the
bond
iniquity
Acts
And
Simon
answered
and
said
Pray
for
the
Lord
that
none
the
things
which
have
spoken
come
upon
Acts
They
therefore
when
they
had
testified
and
spoken
the
word
the
Lord
returned
Jerusalem
and
preached
the
gospel
many
villages
the
Samaritans
Acts
But
angel
the
Lord
spake
unto
Philip
saying
Arise
and
toward
the
south
unto
the
way
that
goeth
down
from
Jerusalem
unto
Gaza
the
same
desert
Acts
And
arose
and
went
and
behold
man
Ethiopia
eunuch
great
authority
under
Candace
queen
the
Ethiopians
who
was
over
all
her
treasure
who
had
come
Jerusalem
worship
Acts
and
was
returning
and
sitting
his
chariot
and
was
reading
the
prophet
Isaiah
Acts
And
the
Spirit
said
unto
Philip
near
and
join
thyself
this
chariot
Acts
And
Philip
ran
him
and
heard
him
reading
Isaiah
the
prophet
and
said
Understandest
thou
what
thou
readest
Acts
And
said
How
can
except
some
one
shall
guide
And
besought
Philip
come
and
sit
with
him
Acts
Now
the
passage
the
Scripture
which
was
reading
was
this
was
led
sheep
the
slaughter
And
lamb
before
his
shearer
dumb
openeth
not
his
mouth
Acts
his
humiliation
his
judgment
was
taken
away
His
generation
who
shall
declare
For
his
life
taken
from
the
earth
Acts
And
the
eunuch
answered
Philip
and
said
pray
thee
whom
speaketh
the
prophet
this
himself
some
other
Acts
And
Philip
opened
his
mouth
and
beginning
from
this
Scripture
preached
unto
him
Jesus
Acts
And
they
went
the
way
they
came
unto
certain
water
and
the
eunuch
saith
Behold
here
water
what
doth
hinder
baptized
Acts
Acts
And
commanded
the
chariot
stand
still
and
they
both
went
down
into
the
water
both
Philip
and
the
eunuch
and
baptized
him
Acts
And
when
they
came
out
the
water
the
Spirit
the
Lord
caught
away
Philip
and
the
eunuch
saw
him
more
for
went
his
way
rejoicing
Acts
But
Philip
was
found
Azotus
and
passing
through
preached
the
gospel
all
the
cities
till
came
Cæsarea
Acts
But
Saul
yet
breathing
threatening
and
slaughter
against
the
disciples
the
Lord
went
unto
the
high
priest
Acts
and
asked
him
letters
Damascus
unto
the
synagogues
that
found
any
that
were
the
Way
whether
men
women
might
bring
them
bound
Jerusalem
Acts
And
journeyed
came
pass
that
drew
nigh
unto
Damascus
and
suddenly
there
shone
round
about
him
light
out
heaven
Acts
and
fell
upon
the
earth
and
heard
voice
saying
unto
him
Saul
Saul
why
persecutest
thou
Acts
And
said
Who
art
thou
Lord
And
said
Jesus
whom
thou
persecutest
Acts
but
rise
and
enter
into
the
city
and
shall
told
thee
what
thou
must
Acts
And
the
men
that
journeyed
with
him
stood
speechless
hearing
the
voice
but
beholding
man
Acts
And
Saul
arose
from
the
earth
and
when
his
eyes
were
opened
saw
nothing
and
they
led
him
the
hand
and
brought
him
into
Damascus
Acts
And
was
three
days
without
sight
and
did
neither
eat
nor
drink
Acts
Now
there
was
certain
disciple
Damascus
named
Ananias
and
the
Lord
said
unto
him
vision
Ananias
And
said
Behold
here
Lord
Acts
And
the
Lord
said
unto
him
Arise
and
the
street
which
called
Straight
and
inquire
the
house
Judas
for
one
named
Saul
man
Tarsus
for
behold
prayeth
Acts
and
hath
seen
man
named
Ananias
coming
and
laying
his
hands
him
that
might
receive
his
sight
Acts
But
Ananias
answered
Lord
have
heard
from
many
this
man
how
much
evil
did
thy
saints
Jerusalem
Acts
and
here
hath
authority
from
the
chief
priests
bind
all
that
call
upon
thy
name
Acts
But
the
Lord
said
unto
him
thy
way
for
chosen
vessel
unto
bear
name
before
the
Gentiles
and
kings
and
the
children
Israel
Acts
for
will
show
him
how
many
things
must
suffer
for
name
sake
Acts
And
Ananias
departed
and
entered
into
the
house
and
laying
his
hands
him
said
Brother
Saul
the
Lord
even
Jesus
who
appeared
unto
thee
the
way
which
thou
camest
hath
sent
that
thou
mayest
receive
thy
sight
and
filled
with
the
Holy
Spirit
Acts
And
straightway
there
fell
from
his
eyes
were
scales
and
received
his
sight
and
arose
and
was
baptized
Acts
and
took
food
and
was
strengthened
And
was
certain
days
with
the
disciples
that
were
Damascus
Acts
And
straightway
the
synagogues
proclaimed
Jesus
that
the
Son
God
Acts
And
all
that
heard
him
were
amazed
and
said
not
this
that
Jerusalem
made
havoc
them
that
called
this
name
and
had
come
hither
for
this
intent
that
might
bring
them
bound
before
the
chief
priests
Acts
But
Saul
increased
the
more
strength
and
confounded
the
Jews
that
dwelt
Damascus
proving
that
this
the
Christ
Acts
And
when
many
days
were
fulfilled
the
Jews
took
counsel
together
kill
him
Acts
but
their
plot
became
known
Saul
And
they
watched
the
gates
also
day
and
night
that
they
might
kill
him
Acts
but
his
disciples
took
him
night
and
let
him
down
through
the
wall
lowering
him
basket
Acts
And
when
was
come
Jerusalem
assayed
join
himself
the
disciples
and
they
were
all
afraid
him
not
believing
that
was
disciple
Acts
But
Barnabas
took
him
and
brought
him
the
apostles
and
declared
unto
them
how
had
seen
the
Lord
the
way
and
that
had
spoken
him
and
how
Damascus
had
preached
boldly
the
name
Jesus
Acts
And
was
with
them
going
and
going
out

Acts
preaching
boldly
the
name
the
Lord
and
spake
and
disputed
against
the
Grecian
Jews
but
they
were
seeking

him
Acts
And
when
the
brethren
knew
they
brought
him
down
Cæsarea

And

and
showing
the
coats
and
garments
which

Acts
But
Peter
put
them
all
forth
and
kneeled
down
and
prayed
and
turning
the
body
said
Tabitha
arise
And
she
opened
her
eyes
and

and
devout

that
waited
him
continually
Acts
and
having
rehearsed
all
things
unto
them

Now
the
morrow
they
were

journey
and
drew
nigh
unto
the
city
Peter
went
upon
the
housetop
pray
about
the
sixth
hour
Acts
and
became
hungry
and
desired

but
while
they
made

Acts
and
beholdeth
the

and

and

And
there
came
voice

Acts
But
Peter
said
Not

for

and
unclean
Acts
And
voice
came
unto
him
again
the
second
time
What
God
hath
cleansed
make
not
thou
common
Acts
And
this
was
done
thrice
and
straightway
the
vessel
was
received
into
heaven
Acts
Now
while
Peter
was
much
perplexed
himself
what
the
vision
which
had
seen
might
mean
behold
the
men
that
were
sent
Cornelius
having
made
inquiry
for
Simon
house
stood
before
the
gate
Acts
and
called
and
asked
whether
Simon
who
was
surnamed
Peter
were
lodging
there
Acts
And
while
Peter
thought
the
vision
the
Spirit
said
unto
him

men

thee
Acts
But
arise
and
get
thee
down
and

And
Peter
went
down
the
men
and
said
Behold

Acts
And
they
said
Cornelius

man
and
one
that
feareth

and
well
reported

warned

his
house
and

them
and
lodged
them
And
the
morrow
arose
and
went
forth
with
them
and
certain
the
brethren
from
Joppa
accompanied
him
Acts
And
the
morrow
they
entered
into
Cæsarea
And
Cornelius
was
waiting
for
them
having
called
together
his
kinsmen
and
his
near
friends
Acts
And
when
came
pass
that
Peter
entered
Cornelius
met
him
and
fell
down
his
feet
and
worshipped
him
Acts
But
Peter
raised
him
saying
Stand

Acts
And
talked
with
him
went
and
findeth

Acts
and
said
unto
them

another
nation
and
yet
unto

Acts
wherefore

without
gainsaying
when

And
Cornelius
said

Forthwith

And
Peter
opened

and
said

but

The

preaching

Jesus
Christ
Lord
all
Acts
that
saying
yourselves
know
which
was
published
throughout
all
Judæa
beginning
from
Galilee
after
the
baptism
which
John
preached
Acts
even
Jesus
Nazareth
how
God
anointed
him
with
the
Holy
Spirit
and
with
power
who
went
about
doing
good
and
healing
all
that
were
oppressed
the
devil
for
God
was
with
him
Acts
And
are
witnesses
all
things
which
did
both
the
country
the
Jews
and
Jerusalem
whom
also
they
slew
hanging

Acts
Him
God
raised
the
third
day
and
gave
him

manifest
Acts
not
all
the
people
but
unto
witnesses
that

before
God
even
who
ate
and
drank
with
him
after
rose
from

And

all
the
prophets
witness
that
through
his
name
every
one
that
believeth
him
shall
receive
remission
sins
Acts
While
Peter
yet
spake
these
words
the
Holy
Spirit
fell
all
them
that
heard
the
word
Acts
And
they
the
circumcision
that
believed
were
amazed
many
came
with
Peter
because
that
the
Gentiles
also
was
poured
out
the
gift
the
Holy
Spirit
Acts
For
they
heard
them
speak
with
tongues
and
magnify
God
Then
answered
Peter
Acts
Can
any
man
forbid
the
water
that
these
should
not
baptized
who
have
received
the
Holy
Spirit
well
Acts
And
commanded
them
baptized
the
name
Jesus
Christ
Then
prayed
they
him
tarry
certain
days
Acts
Now
the
apostles
and
the
brethren
that
were
Judæa
heard
that
the
Gentiles
also
had
received
the
word
God
Acts
And
when
Peter
was
come
Jerusalem
they
that
were
the
circumcision
contended
with
him
Acts
saying
Thou
wentest
men
uncircumcised
and
didst
eat
with
them
Acts
But
Peter
began
and
expounded
the
matter
unto
them
order
saying
Acts
was
the
city
Joppa
praying
and
trance
saw
vision
certain
vessel
descending
were
great
sheet
let
down
from
heaven
four
corners
and
came
even
unto
Acts
upon
which
when
had
fastened
mine
eyes
considered
and
saw
the
fourfooted
beasts
the
earth
and
wild
beasts
and
creeping
things
and
birds
the
heaven
Acts
And
heard
also
voice
saying
unto
Rise
Peter
kill
and
eat
Acts
But
said
Not
Lord
for
nothing
common
unclean
hath
ever
entered
into
mouth
Acts
But
voice
answered
the
second
time
out
heaven
What
God
hath
cleansed
make
not
thou
common
Acts
And
this
was
done
thrice
and
all
were
drawn
again
into
heaven
Acts
And
behold
forthwith
three
men
stood
before
the
house
which
were
having
been
sent
from
Cæsarea
unto
Acts
And
the
Spirit
bade
with
them
making
distinction
And
these
six
brethren
also
accompanied
and
entered
into
the
man
house
Acts
and
told
how
had
seen
the
angel
standing
his
house
and
saying
Send
Joppa
and
fetch
Simon
whose
surname
Peter
Acts
who
shall
speak
unto
thee
words
whereby
thou
shalt
saved
thou
and
all
thy
house
Acts
And
began
speak
the
Holy
Spirit
fell
them
even
the
beginning
Acts
And
remembered
the
word
the
Lord
how
said
John
indeed
baptized
with
water
but
shall
baptized
the
Holy
Spirit
Acts
then
God
gave
unto
them
the
like
gift
did
also
unto
when
believed
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
who
was
that
could
withstand
God
Acts
And
when
they
heard
these
things
they
held
their
peace
and
glorified
God
saying
Then
the
Gentiles
also
hath
God
granted
repentance
unto
life
Acts
They
therefore
that
were
scattered
abroad
upon
the
tribulation
that
arose
about
Stephen
travelled
far
Phoenicia
and
Cyprus
and
Antioch
speaking
the
word
none
save
only
Jews
Acts
But
there
were
some
them
men
Cyprus
and
Cyrene
who
when
they
were
come
Antioch
spake
unto
the
Greeks
also
preaching
the
Lord
Jesus
Acts
And
the
hand
the
Lord
was
with
them
and
great
number
that
believed
turned
unto
the
Lord
Acts
And
the
report
concerning
them
came
the
ears
the
church
which
was
Jerusalem
and
they
sent
forth
Barnabas
far
Antioch
Acts
who
when
was
come
and
had
seen
the
grace
God
was
glad
and
exhorted
them
all
that
with
purpose
heart
they
would
cleave
unto
the
Lord
Acts
for
was
good
man
and
full
the
Holy
Spirit
and
faith
and
much
people
was
added
unto
the
Lord
Acts
And
went
forth
Tarsus
seek
for
Saul
Acts
and
when
had
found
him
brought
him
unto
Antioch
And
came
pass
that
even
for
whole
year
they
were
gathered
together
with
the
church
and
taught
much
people
and
that
the
disciples
were
called
Christians
first
Antioch
Acts
Now
these
days
there
came
down
prophets
from
Jerusalem
unto
Antioch
Acts
And
there
stood
one
them
named
Agabus
and
signified
the
Spirit
that
there
should
great
famine
over
all
the
world
which
came
pass
the
days
Claudius
Acts
And
the
disciples
every
man
according
his
ability
determined
send
relief
unto
the
brethren
that
dwelt
Judea
Acts
which
also
they
did
sending
the
elders
the
hand
Barnabas
and
Saul
Acts
Now
about
that
time
Herod
the
king
put
forth
his
hands
afflict
certain
the
church
Acts
And
killed
James
the
brother
John
with
the
sword
Acts
And
when
saw
that
pleased
the
Jews
proceeded
seize
Peter
also
And
those
were
the
days
unleavened
bread
Acts
And
when
had
taken
him
put
him
prison
and
delivered
him
four
quaternions
soldiers
guard
him
intending
after
the
Passover
bring
him
forth
the
people
Acts
Peter
therefore
was
kept
the
prison
but
prayer
was
made
earnestly
the
church
unto
God
for
him
Acts
And
when
Herod
was
about
bring
him
forth
the
same
night
Peter
was
sleeping
between
two
soldiers
bound
with
two
chains
and
guards
before
the
door
kept
the
prison
Acts
And
behold
angel
the
Lord
stood
him
and
light
shined
the
cell
and
smote
Peter
the
side
and
awoke
him
saying
Rise
quickly
And
his
chains
fell
off
from
his
hands
Acts
And
the
angel
said
unto
him
Gird
thyself
and
bind
thy
sandals
And
did
And
saith
unto
him
Cast
thy
garment
about
thee
and
follow
Acts
And
went
out
and
followed
and
knew
not
that
was
true
which
was
done
the
angel
but
thought
saw
vision
Acts
And
when
they
were
past
the
first
and
the
second
guard
they
came
unto
the
iron
gate
that
leadeth
into
the
city
which
opened
them
its
own
accord
and
they
went
out
and
passed
through
one
street
and
straightway
the
angel
departed
from
him
Acts
And
when
Peter
was
come
himself
said
Now
know
truth
that
the
Lord
hath
sent
forth
his
angel
and
delivered
out
the
hand
Herod
and
from
all
the
expectation
the
people
the
Jews
Acts
And
when
had
considered
the
thing
came
the
house
Mary
the
mother
John
whose
surname
was
Mark
where
many
were
gathered
together
and
were
praying
Acts
And
when
knocked
the
door
the
gate
maid
came
answer
named
Rhoda
Acts
And
when
she
knew
Peter
voice
she
opened
not
the
gate
for
joy
but
ran
and
told
that
Peter
stood
before
the
gate
Acts
And
they
said
unto
her
Thou
art
mad
But
she
confidently
affirmed
that
was
even
And
they
said
his
angel
Acts
But
Peter
continued
knocking
and
when
they
had
opened
they
saw
him
and
were
amazed
Acts
But
beckoning
unto
them
with
the
hand
hold
their
peace
declared
unto
them
how
the
Lord
had
brought
him
forth
out
the
prison
And
said
Tell
these
things
unto
James
and
the
brethren
And
departed
and
went
another
place
Acts
Now
soon
was
day
there
was
small
stir
among
the
soldiers
what
was
become
Peter
Acts
And
when
Herod
had
sought
for
him
and
found
him
not
examined
the
guards
and
commanded
that
they
should
put
death
And
went
down
from
Judæa
Cæsarea
and
tarried
there
Acts
Now
was
highly
displeased
with
them
Tyre
and
Sidon
and
they
came
with
one
accord
him
and
having
made
Blastus
the
king
chamberlain
their
friend
they
asked
for
peace
because
their
country
was
fed
from
the
king
country
Acts
And
upon
set
day
Herod
arrayed
himself
royal
apparel
and
sat
the
throne
and
made
oration
unto
them
Acts
And
the
people
shouted
saying
The
voice
god
and
not
man
Acts
And
immediately
angel
the
Lord
smote
him
because
gave
not
God
the
glory
and
was
eaten
worms
and
gave
the
ghost
Acts
But
the
word
God
grew
and
multiplied
Acts
And
Barnabas
and
Saul
returned
from
Jerusalem
when
they
had
fulfilled
their
ministration
taking
with
them
John
whose
surname
was
Mark
Acts
Now
there
were
Antioch
the
church
that
was
there
prophets
and
teachers
Barnabas
and
Symeon
that
was
called
Niger
and
Lucius
Cyrene
and
Manaen
the
foster
brother
Herod
the
tetrarch
and
Saul
Acts
And
they
ministered
the
Lord
and
fasted
the
Holy
Spirit
said
Separate
Barnabas
and
Saul
for
the
work
whereunto
have
called
them
Acts
Then
when
they
had
fasted
and
prayed
and
laid
their
hands
them
they
sent
them
away
Acts
they
being
sent
forth
the
Holy
Spirit
went
down
Seleucia
and
from
thence
they
sailed
Cyprus
Acts
And
when
they
were
Salamis
they
proclaimed
the
word
God
the
synagogues
the
Jews
and
they
had
also
John
their
attendant
Acts
And
when
they
had
gone
through
the
whole
island
unto
Paphos
they
found
certain
sorcerer

name
was
Bar

who
was

proconsul
Sergius
Paulus
man
understanding
The
same
called
unto
him
Barnabas
and
Saul
and
sought
hear
the
word
God
Acts
But
Elymas
the
sorcerer
for
his
name
interpretation
withstood
them
seeking
turn
aside
the
proconsul
from
the
faith
Acts
But
Saul
who
also
called
Paul
filled
with
the
Holy
Spirit
fastened
his
eyes
him
Acts
and
said
full
all
guile
and
all
villany
thou
son
the
devil
thou
enemy
all
righteousness
wilt
thou
not
cease
pervert
the
right
ways
the
Lord
Acts
And
now
behold
the
hand
the
Lord
upon
thee
and
thou
shalt
blind
not
seeing
the
sun
for
season
And
immediately
there
fell
him
mist
and
darkness
and
went
about
seeking
some
lead
him
the
hand
Acts
Then
the
proconsul
when
saw
what
was
done
believed
being
astonished

teaching
the
Lord
Acts
Now
Paul
and
his
company
set
sail
from
Paphos
and
came

Pamphylia
and
John
departed
from
them
and
returned
Jerusalem

But
they
passing
through

and
they
went
into

and
the
prophets

synagogue
sent
unto
them
saying
Brethren

And
Paul
stood
and
beckoning
with
the
hand
said
Men

Acts
The
God
this
people
Israel

our
fathers
and
exalted
the
people
when
they
sojourned

fifty
years

And
John

day
have
begotten
thee
Acts
And
concerning
that
raised
him
from
the
dead
now
more
return
corruption
hath
spoken
this
wise
will
give
you
the
holy
and
sure
blessings
David
Acts
Because
saith
also
another
psalm
Thou
wilt
not
give
thy
Holy
One
see
corruption
Acts
For
David
after
had
his
own
generation
served
the
counsel
God
fell
asleep
and
was
laid
unto
his
fathers
and
saw
corruption
Acts
but
whom
God
raised
saw
corruption
Acts
known
unto
you
therefore
brethren
that
through
this
man
proclaimed
unto
you
remission
sins
Acts
and
him
every
one
that
believeth
justified
from
all
things
from
which
could
not
justified
the
law
Moses
Acts
Beware
therefore
lest
that
come
upon
you
which
spoken
the
prophets
Acts
Behold
despisers
and
wonder
and
perish
For
work
work
your
days
work
which
shall
wise
believe
one
declare
unto
you
Acts
And
they
went
out
they
besought
that
these
words
might
spoken
them
the
next
sabbath
Acts
Now
when
the
synagogue
broke
many
the
Jews
and
the
devout
proselytes
followed
Paul
and
Barnabas
who
speaking
them
urged
them
continue
the
grace
God
Acts
And
the
next
sabbath
almost
the
whole
city
was
gathered
together
hear
the
word
God
Acts
But
when
the
Jews
saw
the
multitudes
they
were
filled
with
jealousy
and
contradicted
the
things
which
were
spoken
Paul
and
blasphemed
Acts
And
Paul
and
Barnabas
spake
out
boldly
and
said
was
necessary
that
the
word
God
should
first
spoken
you
Seeing
thrust
from
you
and
judge
yourselves
unworthy
eternal
life
turn
the
Gentiles
Acts
For
hath
the
Lord
commanded
saying
have
set
thee
for
light
the
Gentiles
That
thou
shouldest
for
salvation
unto
the
uttermost
part
the
earth
Acts
And
the
Gentiles
heard
this
they
were
glad
and
glorified
the
word
God
and
many
were
ordained
eternal
life
believed
Acts
And
the
word
the
Lord
was
spread
abroad
throughout
all
the
region
Acts
But
the
Jews
urged
the
devout
women
honorable
estate
and
the
chief
men
the
city
and
stirred
persecution
against
Paul
and
Barnabas
and
cast
them
out
their
borders
Acts
But
they
shook
off
the
dust
their
feet
against
them
and
came
unto
Iconium
Acts
And
the
disciples
were
filled
with
joy
and
with
the
Holy
Spirit
Acts
And
came
pass
Iconium
that
they
entered
together
into
the
synagogue
the
Jews
and
spake
that
great
multitude
both
Jews
and
Greeks
believed
Acts
But
the
Jews
that
were
disobedient
stirred
the
souls
the
Gentiles
and
made
them
evil
affected
against
the
brethren
Acts
Long
time
therefore
they
tarried
there
speaking
boldly
the
Lord
who
bare
witness
unto
the
word
his
grace
granting
signs
and
wonders
done
their
hands
Acts
But
the
multitude
the
city
was
divided
and
part
held
with
the
Jews
and
part
with
the
apostles
Acts
And
when
there
was
made
onset
both
the
Gentiles
and
the
Jews
with
their
rulers
treat
them
shamefully
and
stone
them
Acts
they
became
aware
and
fled
unto
the
cities
Lycaonia
Lystra
and
Derbe
and
the
region
round
about
Acts
and
there
they
preached
the
gospel
Acts
And
Lystra
there
sat
certain
man
impotent
his
feet
cripple
from
his
mother
womb
who
never
had
walked
Acts
The
same
heard
Paul
speaking
who
fastening
his
eyes
upon
him
and
seeing
that
had
faith
made
whole
Acts
said
with
loud
voice
Stand
upright
thy
feet
And
leaped
and
walked
Acts
And
when
the
multitude
saw
what
Paul
had
done
they
lifted
their
voice
saying
the
speech
Lycaonia
The
gods
are
come
down
the
likeness
men
Acts
And
they
called
Barnabas
Jupiter
and
Paul
Mercury
because
was
the
chief
speaker
Acts
And
the
priest
Jupiter
whose
temple
was
before
the
city
brought
oxen
and
garlands
unto
the
gates
and
would
have
done
sacrifice
with
the
multitudes
Acts
But
when
the
apostles
Barnabas
and
Paul
heard
they
rent
their
garments
and
sprang
forth
among
the
multitude
crying
out
Acts
and
saying
Sirs
why
these
things
also
are
men
like
passions
with
you
and
bring
you
good
tidings
that
should
turn
from
these
vain
things
unto
living
God
who
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
that
them
Acts
who
the
generations
gone
suffered
all
the
nations
walk
their
own
ways
Acts
And
yet
left
not
himself
without
witness
that
did
good
and
gave
you
from
heaven
rains
and
fruitful
seasons
filling
your
hearts
with
food
and
gladness
Acts
And
with
these
sayings
scarce
restrained
they
the
multitudes
from
doing
sacrifice
unto
them
Acts
But
there
came
Jews
thither
from
Antioch
and
Iconium
and
having
persuaded
the
multitudes
they
stoned
Paul
and
dragged
him
out
the
city
supposing
that
was
dead
Acts
But
the
disciples
stood
round
about
him
rose
and
entered
into
the
city
and
the
morrow
went
forth
with
Barnabas
Derbe
Acts
And
when
they
had
preached
the
gospel
that
city
and
had
made
many
disciples
they
returned
Lystra
and
Iconium
and
Antioch
Acts
confirming
the
souls
the
disciples
exhorting
them
continue
the
faith
and
that
through
many
tribulations
must
enter
into
the
kingdom
God
Acts
And
when
they
had
appointed
for
them
elders
every
church
and
had
prayed
with
fasting
they
commended
them
the
Lord
whom
they
had
believed
Acts
And
they
passed
through
Pisidia
and
came
Pamphylia
Acts
And
when
they
had
spoken
the
word
Perga
they
went
down
Attalia
Acts
and
thence
they
sailed
Antioch
from
whence
they
had
been
committed
the
grace
God
for
the
work
which
they
had
fulfilled
Acts
And
when
they
were
come
and
had
gathered
the
church
together
they
rehearsed
all
things
that
God
had
done
with
them
and
that
had
opened
door
faith
unto
the
Gentiles
Acts
And
they
tarried
little
time
with
the
disciples
Acts
And
certain
men
came
down
from
Judæa
and
taught
the
brethren
saying
Except
circumcised
after
the
custom
Moses
cannot
saved
Acts
And
when
Paul
and
Barnabas
had
small
dissension
and
questioning
with
them
the
brethren
appointed
that
Paul
and
Barnabas
and
certain
other
them
should
Jerusalem
unto
the
apostles
and
elders
about
this
question
Acts
They
therefore
being
brought
their
way
the
church
passed
through
both
Phoenicia
and
Samaria
declaring
the
conversion
the
Gentiles
and
they
caused
great
joy
unto
all
the
brethren
Acts
And
when
they
were
come
Jerusalem
they
were
received
the
church
and
the
apostles
and
the
elders
and
they
rehearsed
all
things
that
God
had
done
with
them
Acts
But
there
rose
certain
the
sect
the
Pharisees
who
believed
saying
needful
circumcise
them
and
charge
them
keep
the
law
Moses
Acts
And
the
apostles
and
the
elders
were
gathered
together
consider
this
matter
Acts
And
when
there
had
been
much
questioning
Peter
rose
and
said
unto
them
Brethren
know
that
good
while
ago
God
made
choice
among
you
that
mouth
the
Gentiles
should
hear
the
word
the
gospel
and
believe
Acts
And
God
who
knoweth
the
heart
bare
them
witness
giving
them
the
Holy
Spirit
even
did
unto
Acts
and
made
distinction
between
and
them
cleansing
their
hearts
faith
Acts
Now
therefore
why
make
trial
God
that
should
put
yoke
upon
the
neck
the
disciples
which
neither
our
fathers
nor
were
able
bear
Acts
But
believe
that
shall
saved
through
the
grace
the
Lord
Jesus
like
manner
they
Acts
And
all
the
multitude
kept
silence
and
they
hearkened
unto
Barnabas
and
Paul
rehearsing
what
signs
and
wonders
God
had
wrought
among
the
Gentiles
through
them
Acts
And
after
they
had
held
their
peace
James
answered
saying
Brethren
hearken
unto
Acts
Symeon
hath
rehearsed
how
first
God
visited
the
Gentiles
take
out
them
people
for
his
name
Acts
And
this
agree
the
words
the
prophets
written
Acts
After
these
things
will
return
And
will
build
again
the
tabernacle
David
which
fallen
And
will
build
again
the
ruins
thereof
And
will
set
Acts
That
the
residue
men
may
seek
after
the
Lord
And
all
the
Gentiles
upon
whom
name
called
Acts
Saith
the
Lord
who
maketh
these
things
known
from
old
Acts
Wherefore
judgment
that
trouble
not
them
that
from
among
the
Gentiles
turn
God
Acts
but
that
write
unto
them
that
they
abstain
from
the
pollutions
idols
and
from
fornication
and
from
what
strangled
and
from
blood
Acts
For
Moses
from
generations
old
hath
every
city
them
that
preach
him
being
read
the
synagogues
every
sabbath
Acts
Then
seemed
good
the
apostles
and
the
elders
with
the
whole
church
choose
men
out
their
company
and
send
them
Antioch
with
Paul
and
Barnabas
namely
Judas
called
Barsabbas
and
Silas
chief
men
among
the
brethren
Acts
and
they
wrote
thus
them
The
apostles
and
the
elders
brethren
unto
the
brethren
who
are
the
Gentiles
Antioch
and
Syria
and
Cilicia
greeting
Acts
Forasmuch
have
heard
that
certain
who
went
out
from
have
troubled
you
with
words
subverting
your
souls
whom
gave
commandment
Acts
seemed
good
unto
having
come
one
accord
choose
out
men
and
send
them
unto
you
with
our
beloved
Barnabas
and
Paul
Acts
men
that
have
hazarded
their
lives
for
the
name
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
Acts
have
sent
therefore
Judas
and
Silas
who
themselves
also
shall
tell
you
the
same
things
word
mouth
Acts
For
seemed
good
the
Holy
Spirit
and
lay
upon
you
greater
burden
than
these
necessary
things
Acts
that
abstain
from
things
sacrificed
idols
and
from
blood
and
from
things
strangled
and
from
fornication
from
which
keep
yourselves
shall
well
with
you
Fare
well
Acts
they
when
they
were
dismissed
came
down
Antioch
and
having
gathered
the
multitude
together
they
delivered
the
epistle
Acts
And
when
they
had
read
they
rejoiced
for
the
consolation
Acts
And
Judas
and
Silas
being
themselves
also
prophets
exhorted
the
brethren
with
many
words
and
confirmed
them
Acts
And
after
they
had
spent
some
time
there
they
were
dismissed
peace
from
the
brethren
unto
those
that
had
sent
them
forth
Acts
Acts
But
Paul
and
Barnabas
tarried
Antioch
teaching
and
preaching
the
word
the
Lord
with
many
others
also
Acts
And
after
some
days
Paul
said
unto
Barnabas
Let
return
now
and
visit
the
brethren
every
city
wherein
proclaimed
the
word
the
Lord
and
see
how
they
fare
Acts
And
Barnabas
was
minded
take
with
them
John
also
who
was
called
Mark
Acts
But
Paul
thought
not
good
take
with
them
him
who
withdrew
from
them
from
Pamphylia
and
went
not
with
them
the
work
Acts
And
there
arose
sharp
contention
that
they
parted
asunder
one
from
the
other
and
Barnabas
took
Mark
with
him
and
sailed
away
unto
Cyprus
Acts
but
Paul
choose
Silas
and
went
forth
being
commended
the
brethren
the
grace
the
Lord
Acts
And
went
through
Syria
and
Cilicia
confirming
the
churches
Acts
And
came
also
Derbe
and
Lystra
and
behold
certain
disciple
was
there
named
Timothy
the
son
Jewess
that
believed
but
his
father
was
Greek
Acts
The
same
was
well
reported
the
brethren
that
were
Lystra
and
Iconium
Acts
Him
would
Paul
have
forth
with
him
and
took
and
circumcised
him
because
the
Jews
that
were
those
parts
for
they
all
knew
that
his
father
was
Greek
Acts
And
they
went
their
way
through
the
cities
they
delivered
them
the
decrees
keep
which
had
been
ordained
the
apostles
and
elders
that
were
Jerusalem
Acts
the
churches
were
strengthened
the
faith
and
increased
number
daily
Acts
And
they
went
through
the
region
Phrygia
and
Galatia
having
been
forbidden
the
Holy
Spirit
speak
the
word
Asia
Acts
and
when
they
were
come
over
against
Mysia
they
assayed
into
Bithynia
and
the
Spirit
Jesus
suffered
them
not
Acts
and
passing
Mysia
they
came
down
Troas
Acts
And
vision
appeared
Paul
the
night
There
was
man
Macedonia
standing
beseeching
him
and
saying
Come
over
into
Macedonia
and
help
Acts
And
when
had
seen
the
vision
straightway
sought
forth
into
Macedonia
concluding
that
God
had
called
preach
the
gospel
them
Acts
Setting
sail
therefore
from
Troas
made
straight
course
Samothrace
and
the
day
following
Neapolis
Acts
and
from
thence
Philippi
which
city
Macedonia
the
first
the
district
Roman
colony
and
were
this
city
tarrying
certain
days
Acts
And
the
sabbath
day
went
forth
without
the
gate
river
side
where
supposed
there
was
place
prayer
and
sat
down
and
spake
unto
the
women
that
were
come
together
Acts
And
certain
woman
named
Lydia
seller
purple
the
city
Thyatira
one
that
worshipped
God
heard
whose
heart
the
Lord
opened
give
heed
unto
the
things
which
were
spoken
Paul
Acts
And
when
she
was
baptized
and
her
household
she
besought
saying
have
judged
faithful
the
Lord
come
into
house
and
abide
there
And
she
constrained
Acts
And
came
pass
were
going
the
place
prayer
that
certain
maid
having
spirit
divination
met
who
brought
her
masters
much
gain
soothsaying
Acts
The
same
following
after
Paul
and
cried
out
saying
These
men
are
servants
the
Most
High
God
who
proclaim
unto
you
the
way
salvation
Acts
And
this
she
did
for
many
days
But
Paul
being
sore
troubled
turned
and
said
the
spirit
charge
thee
the
name
Jesus
Christ
come
out
her
And
came
out
that
very
hour
Acts
But
when
her
masters
saw
that
the
hope
their
gain
was
gone
they
laid
hold
Paul
and
Silas
and
dragged
them
into
the
marketplace
before
the
rulers
Acts
and
when
they
had
brought
them
unto
the
magistrates
they
said
These
men
being
Jews
exceedingly
trouble
our
city
Acts
and
set
forth
customs
which
not
lawful
for
receive
observe
being
Romans
Acts
And
the
multitude
rose
together
against
them
and
the
magistrates
rent
their
garments
off
them
and
commanded
beat
them
with
rods
Acts
And
when
they
had
laid
many
stripes
upon
them
they
cast
them
into
prison
charging
the
jailor
keep
them
safely
Acts
who
having
received
such
charge
cast
them
into
the
inner
prison
and
made
their
feet
fast
the
stocks
Acts
But
about
midnight
Paul
and
Silas
were
praying
and
singing
hymns
unto
God
and
the
prisoners
were
listening
them
Acts
and
suddenly
there
was
great
earthquake
that
the
foundations
the
prison
house
were
shaken
and
immediately
all
the
doors
were
opened
and
every
one
bands
were
loosed
Acts
And
the
jailor
being
roused
out
sleep
and
seeing
the
prison
doors
open
drew
his
sword
and
was
about
kill
himself
supposing
that
the
prisoners
had
escaped
Acts
But
Paul
cried
with
loud
voice
saying
thyself
harm
for
are
all
here
Acts
And
called
for
lights
and
sprang
and
trembling
for
fear
fell
down
before
Paul
and
Silas
Acts
and
brought
them
out
and
said
Sirs
what
must
saved
Acts
And
they
said
Believe
the
Lord
Jesus
and
thou
shalt
saved
thou
and
thy
house
Acts
And
they
spake
the
word
the
Lord
unto
him
with
all
that
were
his
house
Acts
And
took
them
the
same
hour
the
night
and
washed
their
stripes
and
was
baptized
and
all
his
immediately
Acts
And
brought
them
into
his
house
and
set
food
before
them
and
rejoiced
greatly
with
all
his
house
having
believed
God
Acts
But
when
was
day
the
magistrates
sent
the
serjeants
saying
Let
those
men
Acts
And
the
jailor
reported
the
words
Paul
saying
The
magistrates
have
sent
let
you
now
therefore
come
forth
and
peace
Acts
But
Paul
said
unto
them
They
have
beaten
publicly
uncondemned
men
that
are
Romans
and
have
cast
into
prison
and
they
now
cast
out
privily
nay
verily
but
let
them
come
themselves
and
bring
out
Acts
And
the
serjeants
reported
these
words
unto
the
magistrates
and
they
feared
when
they
heard
that
they
were
Romans
Acts
and
they
came
and
besought
them
and
when
they
had
brought
them
out
they
asked
them
away
from
the
city
Acts
And
they
went
out
the
prison
and
entered
into
the
house
Lydia
and
when
they
had
seen
the
brethren
they
comforted
them
and
departed
Acts
Now
when
they
had
passed
through
Amphipolis
and
Apollonia
they
came
Thessalonica
where
was
synagogue
the
Jews
Acts
and
Paul
his
custom
was
went
unto
them
and
for
three
sabbath
days
reasoned
with
them
from
the
Scriptures
Acts
opening
and
alleging
that
behooved
the
Christ
suffer
and
rise
again
from
the
dead
and
that
this
Jesus
whom
said
proclaim
unto
you
the
Christ
Acts
And
some
them
were
persuaded
and
consorted
with
Paul
and
Silas
and
the
devout
Greeks
great
multitude
and
the
chief
women
not
few
Acts
But
the
Jews
being
moved
with
jealousy
took
unto
them
certain
vile
fellows
the
rabble
and
gathering
crowd
set
the
city
uproar
and
assaulting
the
house
Jason
they
sought
bring
them
forth
the
people
Acts
And
when
they
found
them
not
they
dragged
Jason
and
certain
brethren
before
the
rulers
the
city
crying
These
that
have
turned
the
world
upside
down
are
come
hither
also
Acts
whom
Jason
hath
received
and
these
all
act
contrary
the
decrees
Cæsar
saying
that
there
another
king
one
Jesus
Acts
And
they
troubled
the
multitude
and
the
rulers
the
city
when
they
heard
these
things
Acts
And
when
they
had
taken
security
from
Jason
and
the
rest
they
let
them
Acts
And
the
brethren
immediately
sent
away
Paul
and
Silas
night
unto
Beroea
who
when
they
were
come
thither
went
into
the
synagogue
the
Jews
Acts
Now
these
were
more
noble
than
those
Thessalonica
that
they
received
the
word
with
all
readiness
the
mind
examining
the
Scriptures
daily
whether
these
things
were
Acts
Many
them
therefore
believed
also
the
Greek
women
honorable
estate
and
men
not
few
Acts
But
when
the
Jews
Thessalonica
had
knowledge
that
the
word
God
was
proclaimed
Paul
Beroea
also
they
came
thither
likewise
stirring
and
troubling
the
multitudes
Acts
And
then
immediately
the
brethren
sent
forth
Paul
far
the
sea
and
Silas
and
Timothy
abode
there
still
Acts
But
they
that
conducted
Paul
brought
him
far
Athens
and
receiving
commandment
unto
Silas
and
Timothy
that
they
should
come
him
with
all
speed
they
departed
Acts
Now
while
Paul
waited
for
them
Athens
his
spirit
was
provoked
within
him
beheld
the
city
full
idols
Acts
reasoned
the
synagogue
with
Jews
and
the
devout
persons
and
the
marketplace
every
day
with
them
that
met
him
Acts
And
certain
also
the
Epicurean
and
Stoic
philosophers
encountered
him
And
some
said
What
would
this
babbler
say
others
seemeth
setter
forth
strange
gods
because
preached
Jesus
and
the
resurrection
Acts
And
they
took
hold
him
and
brought
him
unto
the
Areopagus
saying
May
know
what
this
new
teaching
which
spoken
thee
Acts
For
thou
bringest
certain
strange
things
our
ears
would
know
therefore
what
these
things
mean
Acts
Now
all
the
Athenians
and
the
strangers
sojourning
there
spent
their
time
nothing
else
but
either
tell
hear
some
new
thing
Acts
And
Paul
stood
the
midst
the
Areopagus
and
said
men
Athens
all
things
perceive
that
are
very
religious
Acts
For
passed
along
and
observed
the
objects
your
worship
found
also
altar
with
this
inscription
UNKNOWN
GOD
What
therefore
worship
ignorance
this
set
forth
unto
you
Acts
The
God
that
made
the
world
and
all
things
therein
being
Lord
heaven
and
earth
dwelleth
not
temples
made
with
hands
Acts
neither
served
men
hands
though
needed
anything
seeing
himself
giveth
all
life
and
breath
and
all
things
Acts
and
made
one
every
nation
men
dwell
all
the
face
the
earth
having
determined
their
appointed
seasons
and
the
bounds
their
habitation
Acts
that
they
should
seek
God
haply
they
might
feel
after
him
and
find
him
though
not
far
from
each
one
Acts
for
him
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
certain
even
your
own
poets
have
said
For
are
also
his
offspring
Acts
Being
then
the
offspring
God
ought
not
think
that
the
Godhead
like
unto
gold
silver
stone
graven
art
and
device
man
Acts
The
times
ignorance
therefore
God
overlooked
but
now
commandeth
men
that
they
should
all
everywhere
repent
Acts
inasmuch
hath
appointed
day
which
will
judge
the
world
righteousness
the
man
whom
hath
ordained
whereof
hath
given
assurance
unto
all
men
that
hath
raised
him
from
the
dead
Acts
Now
when
they
heard
the
resurrection
the
dead
some
mocked
but
others
said
will
hear
thee
concerning
this
yet
again
Acts
Thus
Paul
went
out
from
among
them
Acts
But
certain
men
clave
unto
him
and
believed
among
whom
also
was
Dionysius
the
Areopagite
and
woman
named
Damaris
and
others
with
them
Acts
After
these
things
departed
from
Athens
and
came
Corinth
Acts
And
found
certain
Jew
named
Aquila
man
Pontus
race
lately
come
from
Italy
with
his
wife
Priscilla
because
Claudius
had
commanded
all
the
Jews
depart
from
Rome
and
came
unto
them
Acts
and
because
was
the
same
trade
abode
with
them
and
they
wrought
for
their
trade
they
were
tentmakers
Acts
And
reasoned
the
synagogue
every
sabbath
and
persuaded
Jews
and
Greeks
Acts
But
when
Silas
and
Timothy
came
down
from
Macedonia
Paul
was
constrained
the
word
testifying
the
Jews
that
Jesus
was
the
Christ
Acts
And
when
they
opposed
themselves
and
blasphemed
shook
out
his
raiment
and
said
unto
them
Your
blood
upon
your
own
heads
clean
from
henceforth
will
unto
the
Gentiles
Acts
And
departed
thence
and
went
into
the
house
certain
man
named
Titus
Justus
one
that
worshipped
God
whose
house
joined
hard
the
synagogue
Acts
And
Crispus
the
ruler
the
synagogue
believed
the
Lord
with
all
his
house
and
many
the
Corinthians
hearing
believed
and
were
baptized
Acts
And
the
Lord
said
unto
Paul
the
night
vision
not
afraid
but
speak
and
hold
not
thy
peace
Acts
for
with
thee
and
man
shall
set
thee
harm
thee
for
have
much
people
this
city
Acts
And
dwelt
there
year
and
six
months
teaching
the
word
God
among
them
Acts
But
when
Gallio
was
proconsul
Achaia
the
Jews
with
one
accord
rose
against
Paul
and
brought
him
before
the
judgment
seat
Acts
saying
This
man
persuadeth
men
worship
God
contrary
the
law
Acts
But
when
Paul
was
about
open
his
mouth
Gallio
said
unto
the
Jews
indeed
were
matter
wrong
wicked
villany
Jews
reason
would
that
should
bear
with
you
Acts
but
they
are
questions
about
words
and
names
and
your
own
law
look
yourselves
not
minded
judge
these
matters
Acts
And
drove
them
from
the
judgment
seat
Acts
And
they
all
laid
hold
Sosthenes
the
ruler
the
synagogue
and
beat
him
before
the
judgment
seat
And
Gallio
cared
for
none
these
things
Acts
And
Paul
having
tarried
after
this
yet
many
days
took
his
leave
the
brethren
and
sailed
thence
for
Syria
and
with
him
Priscilla
and
Aquila
having
shorn
his
head
Cenchreae
for
had
vow
Acts
And
they
came
Ephesus
and
left
them
there
but
himself
entered
into
the
synagogue
and
reasoned
with
the
Jews
Acts
And
when
they
asked
him
abide
longer
time
consented
not
Acts
but
taking
his
leave
them
and
saying
will
return
again
unto
you
God
will
set
sail
from
Ephesus
Acts
And
when
had
landed
Cæsarea
went
and
saluted
the
church
and
went
down
Antioch
Acts
And
having
spent
some
time
there
departed
and
went
through
the
region
Galatia
and
Phrygia
order
establishing
all
the
disciples
Acts
Now
certain
Jew
named
Apollos
Alexandrian
race
eloquent
man
came
Ephesus
and
was
mighty
the
scriptures
Acts
This
man
had
been
instructed
the
way
the
Lord
and
being
fervent
spirit
spake
and
taught
accurately
the
things
concerning
Jesus
knowing
only
the
baptism
John
Acts
and
began
speak
boldly
the
synagogue
But
when
Priscilla
and
Aquila
heard
him
they
took
him
unto
them
and
expounded
unto
him
the
way
God
more
accurately
Acts
And
when
was
minded
pass
over
into
Achaia
the
brethren
encouraged
him
and
wrote
the
disciples
receive
him
and
when
was
come
helped
them
much
that
had
believed
through
grace
Acts
for
powerfully
confuted
the
Jews
and
that
publicly
showing
the
scriptures
that
Jesus
was
the
Christ
Acts
And
came
pass
that
while
Apollos
was
Corinth
Paul
having
passed
through
the
upper
country
came
Ephesus
and
found
certain
disciples
Acts
and
said
unto
them
Did
receive
the
Holy
Spirit
when
believed
And
they
said
unto
him
Nay
did
not
much
hear
whether
the
Holy
Spirit
was
given
Acts
And
said
Into
what
then
were
baptized
And
they
said
Into
John
baptism
Acts
And
Paul
said
John
baptized
with
the
baptism
repentance
saying
unto
the
people
that
they
should
believe
him
that
should
come
after
him
that
Jesus
Acts
And
when
they
heard
this
they
were
baptized
into
the
name
the
Lord
Jesus
Acts
And
when
Paul
had
laid
his
hands
upon
them
the
Holy
Spirit
came
them
and
they
spake
with
tongues
and
prophesied
Acts
And
they
were
all
about
twelve
men
Acts
And
entered
into
the
synagogue
and
spake
boldly
for
the
space
three
months
reasoning
and
persuading
the
things
concerning
the
kingdom
God
Acts
But
when
some
were
hardened
and
disobedient
speaking
evil
the
Way
before
the
multitude
departed
from
them
and
separated
the
disciples
reasoning
daily
the
school
Tyrannus
Acts
And
this
continued
for
the
space
two
years
that
all
they
that
dwelt
Asia
heard
the
word
the
Lord
both
Jews
and
Greeks
Acts
And
God
wrought
special
miracles
the
hands
Paul
Acts
insomuch
that
unto
the
sick
were
carried
away
from
his
body
handkerchiefs
aprons
and
the
diseases
departed
from
them
and
the
evil
spirits
went
out
Acts
But
certain
also
the
strolling
Jews
exorcists
took
upon
them
name
over
them
that
had
the
evil
spirits
the
name
the
Lord
Jesus
saying
adjure
you
Jesus
whom
Paul
preacheth
Acts
And
there
were
seven
sons
one
Sceva
Jew
chief
priest
who
did
this
Acts
And
the
evil
spirit
answered
and
said
unto
them
Jesus
know
and
Paul
know
but
who
are
Acts
And
the
man
whom
the
evil
spirit
was
leaped
them
and
mastered
both
them
and
prevailed
against
them
that
they
fled
out
that
house
naked
and
wounded
Acts
And
this
became
known
all
both
Jews
and
Greeks
that
dwelt
Ephesus
and
fear
fell
upon
them
all
and
the
name
the
Lord
Jesus
was
magnified
Acts
Many
also
them
that
had
believed
came
confessing
and
declaring
their
deeds
Acts
And
not
few
them
that
practised
magical
arts
brought
their
books
together
and
burned
them
the
sight
all
and
they
counted
the
price
them
and
found
fifty
thousand
pieces
silver
Acts
mightily
grew
the
word
the
Lord
and
prevailed
Acts
Now
after
these
things
were
ended
Paul
purposed
the
spirit
when
had
passed
through
Macedonia
and
Achaia
Jerusalem
saying
After
have
been
there
must
also
see
Rome
Acts
And
having
sent
into
Macedonia
two
them
that
ministered
unto
him
Timothy
and
Erastus
himself
stayed
Asia
for
while
Acts
And
about
that
time
there
arose
small
stir
concerning
the
Way
Acts
For
certain
man
named
Demetrius
silversmith
who
made
silver
shrines
Diana
brought
little
business
unto
the
craftsmen
Acts
whom
gathered
together
with
the
workmen
like
occupation
and
said
Sirs
know
that
this
business
have
our
wealth
Acts
And
see
and
hear
that
not
alone
Ephesus
but
almost
throughout
all
Asia
this
Paul
hath
persuaded
and
turned
away
much
people
saying
that
they
are
gods
that
are
made
with
hands
Acts
and
not
only
there
danger
that
this
our
trade
come
into
disrepute
but
also
that
the
temple
the
great
goddess
Diana
made
account
and
that
she
should
even
deposed
from
her
magnificence
whom
all
Asia
and
the
world
worshippeth
Acts
And
when
they
heard
this
they
were
filled
with
wrath
and
cried
out
saying
Great
Diana
the
Ephesians
Acts
And
the
city
was
filled
with
the
confusion
and
they
rushed
with
one
accord
into
the
theatre
having
seized
Gaius
and
Aristarchus
men
Macedonia
Paul
companions
travel
Acts
And
when
Paul
was
minded
enter
unto
the
people
the
disciples
suffered
him
not
Acts
And
certain
also
the
Asiarchs
being
his
friends
sent
unto
him
and
besought
him
not
adventure
himself
into
the
theatre
Acts
Some
therefore
cried
one
thing
and
some
another
for
the
assembly
was
confusion
and
the
more
part
knew
not
wherefore
they
were
come
together
Acts
And
they
brought
Alexander
out
the
multitude
the
Jews
putting
him
forward
And
Alexander
beckoned
with
the
hand
and
would
have
made
defense
unto
the
people
Acts
But
when
they
perceived
that
was
Jew
all
with
one
voice
about
the
space
two
hours
cried
out
Great
Diana
the
Ephesians
Acts
And
when
the
townclerk
had
quieted
the
multitude
saith
men
Ephesus
what
man
there
who
knoweth
not
that
the
city
the
Ephesians
temple
keeper
the
great
Diana
and
the
image
which
fell
down
from
Jupiter
Acts
Seeing
then
that
these
things
cannot
gainsaid
ought
quiet
and
nothing
rash
Acts
For
have
brought
hither
these
men
who
are
neither
robbers
temples
nor
blasphemers
our
goddess
Acts
therefore
Demetrius
and
the
craftsmen
that
are
with
him
have
matter
against
any
man
the
courts
are
open
and
there
are
proconsuls
let
them
accuse
one
another
Acts
But
seek
anything
about
other
matters
shall
settled
the
regular
assembly
Acts
For
indeed
are
danger
accused
concerning
this
day
riot
there
being
cause
for
and
touching
shall
not
able
give
account
this
concourse
Acts
And
when
had
thus
spoken
dismissed
the
assembly
Acts
And
after
the
uproar
ceased
Paul
having
sent
for
the
disciples
and
exhorted
them
took
leave
them
and
departed
into
Macedonia
Acts
And
when
had
gone
through
those
parts
and
had
given
them
much
exhortation
came
into
Greece
Acts
And
when
had
spent
three
months
there
and
plot
was
laid
against
him
the
Jews
was
about
set
sail
for
Syria
determined
return
through
Macedonia
Acts
And
there
accompanied
him
far
Asia
Sopater
Beroea
the
son
Pyrrhus
and
the
Thessalonians
Aristarchus
and
Secundus
and
Gaius
Derbe
and
Timothy
and
Asia
Tychicus
and
Trophimus
Acts
But
these
had
gone
before
and
were
waiting
for
Troas
Acts
And
sailed
away
from
Philippi
after
the
days
unleavened
bread
and
came
unto
them
Troas
five
days
where
tarried
seven
days
Acts
And
upon
the
first
day
the
week
when
were
gathered
together
break
bread
Paul
discoursed
with
them
intending
depart
the
morrow
and
prolonged
his
speech
until
midnight
Acts
And
there
were
many
lights
the
upper
chamber
where
were
gathered
together
Acts
And
there
sat
the
window
certain
young
man
named
Eutychus
borne
down
with
deep
sleep
and
Paul
discoursed
yet
longer
being
borne
down
his
sleep
fell
down
from
the
third
story
and
was
taken
dead
Acts
And
Paul
went
down
and
fell
him
and
embracing
him
said
Make
ado
for
his
life
him
Acts
And
when
was
gone
and
had
broken
the
bread
and
eaten
and
had
talked
with
them
long
while
even
till
break
day
departed
Acts
And
they
brought
the
lad
alive
and
were
not
little
comforted
Acts
But
going
before
the
ship
set
sail
for
Assos
there
intending
take
Paul
for
had
appointed
intending
himself

Acts
And
when
met
Assos
took
him
and
came
Mitylene
Acts
And
sailing
from
thence
came
the
following
day
over
against
Chios
and
the
next
day
touched
Samos
and
the
day
after
came
Miletus
Acts
For
Paul
had
determined
sail
past
Ephesus
that
might
not
have
spend
time
Asia
for
was
hastening
were
possible
for
him
Jerusalem
the
day
Pentecost
Acts
And
from
Miletus
sent
Ephesus
and
called
him
the
elders
the
church
Acts
And
when
they
were
come
him
said
unto
them
yourselves
know
from
the
first
day
that
set
foot
Asia
after
what
manner
was
with
you
all
the
time
Acts
serving
the
Lord
with
all
lowliness
mind
and
with
tears
and
with
trials
which
befell
the
plots
the
Jews
Acts
how
shrank
not
from
declaring
unto
you
anything
that
was
profitable
and
teaching
you
publicly
and
from
house
house
Acts
testifying
both
Jews
and
Greeks
repentance
toward
God
and
faith
toward
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
Acts
And
now
behold
bound
the
spirit
unto
Jerusalem
not
knowing
the
things
that
shall
befall
there
Acts
save
that
the
Holy
Spirit
testifieth
unto
every
city
saying
that
bonds
and
afflictions
abide
Acts
But
hold
not
life
any
account
dear
unto
myself
that
may
accomplish
course
and
the
ministry
which
received
from
the
Lord
Jesus
testify
the
gospel
the
grace
God
Acts
And
now
behold
know
that
all
among
whom
went
about
preaching
the
kingdom
shall
see
face
more
Acts
Wherefore
testify
unto
you
this
day
that
pure
from
the
blood
all
men
Acts
For
shrank
not
from
declaring
unto
you
the
whole
counsel
God
Acts
Take
heed
unto
yourselves
and
all
the

his
own
blood
Acts
know
that
after
departing
grievous
wolves
shall
enter
among
you
not
sparing
the
flock
Acts
and
from
among
your
own
selves
shall
men
arise
speaking
perverse
things
draw
away
the
disciples
after
them
Acts
Wherefore
watch
remembering
that
the
space
three
years
ceased
not
admonish
every
one
night
and
day
with
tears
Acts
And
now
commend
you
God
and

grace
which

Acts
coveted

Acts
yourselves
know
that
these
hands
ministered
unto
necessities
and
them
that
were
with
Acts
all
things
gave
you
example
that
laboring
ought
help
the
weak
and
remember
the
words
the
Lord
Jesus
that
himself
said
more
blessed
give
than
receive
Acts
And
when
had
thus
spoken
kneeled
down
and
prayed
with
them
all
Acts
And
they
all
wept
sore
and
fell
Paul
neck
and
kissed
him
Acts
sorrowing
most
all
for
the
word
which
had
spoken
that
they
should
behold
his
face
more
And
they
brought
him
his
way
unto
the
ship
Acts
And
when
came
pass
that
were
parted
from
them
and
had
set
sail
came
with
straight
course
unto
Cos
and
the
next
day
unto
Rhodes
and
from
thence
unto
Patara
Acts
and
having
found
ship
crossing
over
unto
Phoenicia
went
aboard
and
set
sail
Acts
And
when
had
come
sight
Cyprus
leaving
the
left
hand
sailed
unto
Syria
and
landed
Tyre
for
there
the
ship
was
unlade
her
burden
Acts
And
having
found
the
disciples
tarried
there
seven
days
and
these
said
Paul
through
the
Spirit
that
should
not
set
foot
Jerusalem
Acts
And
when
came
pass
that
had
accomplished
the
days
departed
and
went
our
journey
and
they
all
with
wives
and
children
brought
our
way
till
were
out
the
city
and
kneeling
down
the
beach
prayed
and
bade
each
other
farewell
Acts
and
went
board
the
ship
but
they
returned
home
again
Acts
And
when
had
finished
the
voyage
from
Tyre
arrived
Ptolemais
and
saluted
the
brethren
and
abode
with
them
one
day
Acts
And
the
morrow
departed
and
came
unto
Cæsarea
and
entering
into
the
house
Philip
the
evangelist
who
was
one
the
seven
abode
with
him
Acts
Now
this
man
had
four
virgin
daughters
who
prophesied
Acts
And
tarried
there
some
days
there
came
down
from
Judæa
certain
prophet
named
Agabus
Acts
And
coming
and
taking
Paul
girdle
bound
his
own
feet
and
hands
and
said
Thus
saith
the
Holy
Spirit
shall
the
Jews
Jerusalem
bind
the
man
that
owneth
this
girdle
and
shall
deliver
him
into
the
hands
the
Gentiles
Acts
And
when
heard
these
things
both
and
they
that
place
besought
him
not
Jerusalem
Acts
Then
Paul
answered
What
weeping
and
breaking
heart
for
ready
not
bound
only
but
also
die
Jerusalem
for
the
name
the
Lord
Jesus
Acts
And
when
would
not
persuaded
ceased
saying
The
will
the
Lord
done
Acts
And
after
these
days
took
our
baggage
and
went
Jerusalem
Acts
And
there
went
with
also
certain
the
disciples
from
Cæsarea
bringing
with
them
one
Mnason
Cyprus
early
disciple
with
whom
should
lodge
Acts
And
when
were
come
Jerusalem
the
brethren
received
gladly
Acts
And
the
day
following
Paul
went
with
unto
James
and
all
the
elders
were
present
Acts
And
when
had
saluted
them
rehearsed
one
one
the
things
which
God
had
wrought
among
the
Gentiles
through
his
ministry
Acts
And
they
when
they
heard
glorified
God
and
they
said
unto
him
Thou
seest
brother
how
many
thousands
there
are
among
the
Jews
them
that
have
believed
and
they
are
all
zealous
for
the
law
Acts
and
they
have
been
informed
concerning
thee
that
thou
teachest
all
the
Jews
who
are
among
the
Gentiles
forsake
Moses
telling
them
not
circumcise
their
children
neither
walk
after
the
customs
Acts
What
therefore
they
will
certainly
hear
that
thou
art
come
Acts
therefore
this
that
say
thee
have
four
men
that
have
vow
them
Acts
these
take
and
purify
thyself
with
them
and
charges
for
them
that
they
may
shave
their
heads
and
all
shall
know
that
there
truth
the
things
whereof
they
have
been
informed
concerning
thee
but
that
thou
thyself
also
walkest
orderly
keeping
the
law
Acts
But
touching
the
Gentiles
that
have
believed
wrote
giving
judgment
that
they
should
keep
themselves
from
things
sacrificed
idols
and
from
blood
and
from
what
strangled
and
from
fornication
Acts
Then
Paul
took
the
men
and
the
next
day
purifying
himself
with
them
went
into
the
temple
declaring
the
fulfilment
the
days
purification
until
the
offering
was
offered
for
every
one
them
Acts
And
when
the
seven
days
were
almost
completed
the
Jews
from
Asia
when
they
saw
him
the
temple
stirred
all
the
multitude
and
laid
hands
him
Acts
crying
out
Men
Israel
help
This
the
man
that
teacheth
all
men
everywhere
against
the
people
and
the
law
and
this
place
and
moreover
brought
Greeks
also
into
the
temple
and
hath
defiled
this
holy
place
Acts
For
they
had
before
seen
with
him
the
city
Trophimus
the
Ephesian
whom
they
supposed
that
Paul
had
brought
into
the
temple
Acts
And
all
the
city
was
moved
and
the
people
ran
together
and
they
laid
hold
Paul
and
dragged
him
out
the
temple
and
straightway
the
doors
were
shut
Acts
And
they
were
seeking
kill
him
tidings
came
the
chief
captain
the
band
that
all
Jerusalem
was
confusion
Acts
And
forthwith
took
soldiers
and
centurions
and
ran
down
upon
them
and
they
when
they
saw
the
chief
captain
and
the
soldiers
left
off
beating
Paul
Acts
Then
the
chief
captain
came
near
and
laid
hold
him
and
commanded
him
bound
with
two
chains
and
inquired
who
was
and
what
had
done
Acts
And
some
shouted
one
thing
some
another
among
the
crowd
and
when
could
not
know
the
certainty
for
the
uproar
commanded
him
brought
into
the
castle
Acts
And
when
came
upon
the
stairs
was
that
was
borne
the
soldiers
for
the
violence
the
crowd
Acts
for
the
multitude
the
people
followed
after
crying
out
Away
with
him
Acts
And
Paul
was
about
brought
into
the
castle
saith
unto
the
chief
captain
May
say
something
unto
thee
And
said
Dost
thou
know
Greek
Acts
Art
thou
not
then
the
Egyptian
who
before
these
days
stirred
sedition
and
led
out
into
the
wilderness
the
four
thousand
men
the
Assassins
Acts
But
Paul
said
Jew
Tarsus
Cilicia
citizen
mean
city
and
beseech
thee
give
leave
speak
unto
the
people
Acts
And
when
had
given
him
leave
Paul
standing
the
stairs
beckoned
with
the
hand
unto
the
people
and
when
there
was
made
great
silence
spake
unto
them
the
Hebrew
language
saying
Acts
Brethren
and
fathers
hear
the
defence
which
now
make
unto
you
Acts
And
when
they
heard
that
spake
unto
them
the
Hebrew
language
they
were
the
more
quiet
and
saith
Acts
Jew
born
Tarsus
Cilicia
but
brought
this
city
the
feet
Gamaliel
instructed
according
the
strict
manner
the
law
our
fathers
being
zealous
for
God
even
all
are
this
day
Acts
and
persecuted
this
Way
unto
the
death
binding
and
delivering
into
prisons
both
men
and
women
Acts
also
the
high
priest
doth
bear
witness
and
all
the
estate
the
elders
from
whom
also
received
letters
unto
the
brethren
and
journeyed
Damascus
bring
them
also
that
were
there
unto
Jerusalem
bonds
punished
Acts
And
came
pass
that
made
journey
and
drew
nigh
unto
Damascus
about
noon
suddenly
there
shone
from
heaven
great
light
round
about
Acts
And
fell
unto
the
ground
and
heard
voice
saying
unto
Saul
Saul
why
persecutest
thou
Acts
And
answered
Who
art
thou
Lord
And
said
unto
Jesus
Nazareth
whom
thou
persecutest
Acts
And
they
that
were
with
beheld
indeed
the
light
but
they
heard
not
the
voice
him
that
spake
Acts
And
said
What
shall
Lord
And
the
Lord
said
unto
Arise
and
into
Damascus
and
there
shall
told
thee
all
things
which
are
appointed
for
thee
Acts
And
when
could
not
see
for
the
glory
that
light
being
led
the
hand
them
that
were
with
came
into
Damascus
Acts
And
one
Ananias
devout
man
according
the
law
well
reported
all
the
Jews
that
dwelt
there
Acts
came
unto
and
standing
said
unto
Brother
Saul
receive
thy
sight
And
that
very
hour
looked
him
Acts
And
said
The
God
our
fathers
hath
appointed
thee
know
his
will
and
see
the
Righteous
One
and
hear
voice
from
his
mouth
Acts
For
thou
shalt
witness
for
him
unto
all
men
what
thou
hast
seen
and
heard
Acts
And
now
why
tarriest
thou
arise
and
baptized
and
wash
away
thy
sins
calling
his
name
Acts
And
came
pass
that
when
had
returned
Jerusalem
and
while
prayed
the
temple
fell
into
trance
Acts
and
saw
him
saying
unto
Make
haste
and
get
thee
quickly
out
Jerusalem
because
they
will
not
receive
thee
testimony
concerning
Acts
And
said
Lord
they
themselves
know
that
imprisoned
and
beat
every
synagogue
them
that
believed
thee
Acts
and
when
the
blood
Stephen
thy
witness
was
shed
also
was
standing
and
consenting
and
keeping
the
garments
them
that
slew
him
Acts
And
said
unto
Depart
for
will
send
thee
forth
far
hence
unto
the
Gentiles
Acts
And
they
gave
him
audience
unto
this
word
and
they
lifted
their
voice
and
said
Away
with
such
fellow
from
the
earth
for
not
fit
that
should
live
Acts
And
they
cried
out
and
threw
off
their
garments
and
cast
dust
into
the
air
Acts
the
chief
captain
commanded
him
brought
into
the
castle
bidding
that
should
examined
scourging
that
might
know
for
what
cause
they
shouted
against
him
Acts
And
when
they
had
tied
him
with
the
thongs
Paul
said
unto
the
centurion
that
stood
lawful
for
you
scourge
man
that
Roman
and
uncondemned
Acts
And
when
the
centurion
heard
went
the
chief
captain
and
told
him
saying
What
art
thou
about
for
this
man
Roman
Acts
And
the
chief
captain
came
and
said
unto
him
Tell
art
thou
Roman
And
said
Yea
Acts
And
the
chief
captain
answered
With
great
sum
obtained
this
citizenship
And
Paul
said
But
Roman
born
Acts
They
then
that
were
about
examine
him
straightway
departed
from
him
and
the
chief
captain
also
was
afraid
when
knew
that
was
Roman
and
because
had
bound
him
Acts
But
the
morrow
desiring
know
the
certainty
wherefore
was
accused
the
Jews
loosed
him
and
commanded
the
chief
priests
and
all
the
council
come
together
and
brought
Paul
down
and
set
him
before
them
Acts
And
Paul
looking
stedfastly
the
council
said
Brethren
have
lived
before
God
all
good
conscience
until
this
day
Acts
And
the
high
priest
Ananias
commanded
them
that
stood
him
smite
him
the
mouth
Acts
Then
said
Paul
unto
him
God
shall
smite
thee
thou
whited
wall
and
sittest
thou
judge
according
the
law
and
commandest
smitten
contrary
the
law
Acts
And
they
that
stood
said
Revilest
thou
God
high
priest
Acts
And
Paul
said
knew
not
brethren
that
was
high
priest
for
written
Thou
shalt
not
speak
evil
ruler
thy
people
Acts
But
when
Paul
perceived
that
the
one
part
were
Sadducees
and
the
other
Pharisees
cried
out
the
council
Brethren
Pharisee
son
Pharisees
touching
the
hope
and
resurrection
the
dead
called
question
Acts
And
when
had
said
there
arose
dissension
between
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
and
the
assembly
was
divided
Acts
For
the
Sadducees
say
that
there
resurrection
neither
angel
nor
spirit
but
the
Pharisees
confess
both
Acts
And
there
arose
great
clamor
and
some
the
scribes
the
Pharisees
part
stood
and
strove
saying
find
evil
this
man
and
what
spirit
hath
spoken
him
angel
Acts
And
when
there
arose
great
dissension
the
chief
captain
fearing
lest
Paul
should
torn
pieces
them
commanded
the
soldiers
down
and
take
him
force
from
among
them
and
bring
him
into
the
castle
Acts
And
the
night
following
the
Lord
stood
him
and
said
good
cheer
for
thou
hast
testified
concerning
Jerusalem
must
thou
bear
witness
also
Rome
Acts
And
when
was
day
the
Jews
banded
together
and
bound
themselves
under
curse
saying
that
they
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
till
they
had
killed
Paul
Acts
And
they
were
more
than
forty
that
made
this
conspiracy
Acts
And
they
came
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
and
said
have
bound
ourselves
under
great
curse
taste
nothing
until
have
killed
Paul
Acts
Now
therefore
with
the
council
signify
the
chief
captain
that
bring
him
down
unto
you
though
would
judge
his
case
more
exactly
and
before
comes
near
are
ready
slay
him
Acts
But
Paul
sister
son
heard
their
lying
wait
and
came
and
entered
into
the
castle
and
told
Paul
Acts
And
Paul
called
unto
him
one
the
centurions
and
said
Bring
this
young
man
unto
the
chief
captain
for
hath
something
tell
him
Acts
took
him
and
brought
him
the
chief
captain
and
saith
Paul
the
prisoner
called
unto
him
and
asked
bring
this
young
man
unto
thee
who
hath
something
say
thee
Acts
And
the
chief
captain
took
him
the
hand
and
going
aside
asked
him
privately
What
that
thou
hast
tell
Acts
And
said
The
Jews
have
agreed
ask
thee
bring
down
Paul
tomorrow
unto
the
council
though
thou
wouldest
inquire
somewhat
more
exactly
concerning
him
Acts
not
thou
therefore
yield
unto
them
for
there
lie
wait
for
him
them
more
than
forty
men
who
have
bound
themselves
under
curse
neither
eat
nor
drink
till
they
have
slain
him
and
now
are
they
ready
looking
for
the
promise
from
thee
Acts
the
chief
captain
let
the
young
man
charging
him
Tell
man
that
thou
hast
signified
these
things
Acts
And
called
unto
him
two
the
centurions
and
said
Make

hundred
soldiers

and

and
ten
and

Acts
and
bade
them
provide
beasts
that
they
might
set
Paul
thereon
and
bring
him
safe
unto
Felix
the
governor
Acts
And
wrote

after
this
form
Acts
Claudius

unto
the
most
excellent
governor
Felix

Acts
This
man
was
seized
the
Jews
and
was
about
slain
them
when
came
upon
them
with
the
soldiers
and
rescued
him
having
learned
that

And

the
cause
wherefore
they
accused

unto
their
council
Acts
whom

law
but

And
when

And

with
certain
elders
and
with

and
they
informed
the

And
when

And
the
Jews

And
when

answered
Forasmuch

cheerfully
make
defense
Acts
seeing
that
thou
canst
take
knowledge
that
not
more
than
twelve
days
since
went
worship
Jerusalem
Acts
and
neither
the
temple
did
they
find
disputing
with
any
man
stirring
crowd
nor
the
synagogues
nor
the
city
Acts
Neither
can
they
prove
thee
the
things
whereof
they
now
accuse
Acts
But
this
confess
unto
thee
that
after
the
Way
which
they
call
sect
serve
the
God
our
fathers
believing
all
things
which
are
according
the
law
and
which
are
written
the
prophets
Acts
having
hope
toward
God
which
these
also
themselves
look
for
that
there
shall
resurrection
both
the
just
and
unjust
Acts
Herein
also
exercise
myself
have
conscience
void
offence
toward
God
and
men
always
Acts
Now
after
some
years
came
bring
alms
nation
and
offerings
Acts
amidst
which
they
found
purified
the
temple
with
crowd
nor
yet
with
tumult
but
there
were
certain
Jews
from
Asia
Acts
who
ought
have
been
here
before
thee
and
make
accusation
they
had
aught
against
Acts
else
let
these
men
themselves
say
what
wrong
doing
they
found
when
stood
before
the
council
Acts
except
for
this
one
voice
that
cried
standing
among
them
Touching
the
resurrection
the
dead
called
question
before
you
this
day
Acts
But
Felix
having
more
exact
knowledge
concerning
the
Way
deferred
them
saying
When
Lysias
the
chief
captain
shall
come
down
will
determine
your
matter
Acts
And
gave
order
the
centurion
that
should
kept
charge
and
should
have
indulgence
and
not
forbid
any
his
friends
minister
unto
him
Acts
But
after
certain
days
Felix
came
with
Drusilla
his
wife
who
was
Jewess
and
sent
for
Paul
and
heard
him
concerning
the
faith
Christ
Jesus
Acts
And
reasoned
righteousness
and
self
control
and
the
judgment
come
Felix
was
terrified
and
answered
thy
way
for
this
time
and
when
have
convenient
season
will
call
thee
unto
Acts
hoped
withal
that
money
would
given
him
Paul
wherefore
also
sent
for
him
the
oftener
and
communed
with
him
Acts
But
when
two
years
were
fulfilled
Felix
was
succeeded
Porcius
Festus
and
desiring
gain
favor
with
the
Jews
Felix
left
Paul
bonds
Acts
Festus
therefore
having
come
into
the
province
after
three
days
went
Jerusalem
from
Cæsarea
Acts
And
the
chief
priests
and
the
principal
men
the
Jews
informed
him
against
Paul
and
they
besought
him
Acts
asking
favor
against
him
that
would
send
for
him
Jerusalem
laying
plot
kill
him
the
way
Acts
Howbeit
Festus
answered
that
Paul
was
kept
charge
Cæsarea
and
that
himself
was
about
depart
thither
shortly
Acts
Let
them
therefore
saith
that
are
power
among
you
down
with
and
there
anything
amiss
the
man
let
them
accuse
him
Acts
And
when
had
tarried
among
them
not
more
than
eight
ten
days
went
down
unto
Cæsarea
and
the
morrow
sat
the
judgment
seat
and
commanded
Paul
brought
Acts
And
when
was
come
the
Jews
that
had
come
down
from
Jerusalem
stood
round
about
him
bringing
against
him
many
and
grievous
charges
which
they
could
not
prove
Acts
while
Paul
said
his
defense
Neither
against
the
law
the
Jews
nor
against
the
temple
nor
against
Cæsar
have
sinned
all
Acts
But
Festus
desiring
gain
favor
with
the
Jews
answered
Paul
and
said
Wilt
thou
Jerusalem
and
there
judged
these
things
before
Acts
But
Paul
said
standing
before
Cæsar
judgment
seat
where
ought
judged
the
Jews
have
done
wrong
thou
also
very
well
knowest
Acts
then
wrong
doer
and
have
committed
anything
worthy
death
refuse
not
die
but
none
those
things
true
whereof
these
accuse
man
can
give
unto
them
appeal
unto
Cæsar
Acts
Then
Festus
when
had
conferred
with
the
council
answered
Thou
hast
appealed
unto
Cæsar
unto
Cæsar
shalt
thou
Acts
Now
when
certain
days
were
passed
Agrippa
the
King
and
Bernice
arrived
Cæsarea
and
saluted
Festus
Acts
And
they
tarried
there
many
days
Festus
laid
Paul
case
before
the
King
saying
There
certain
man
left
prisoner
Felix
Acts
about
whom
when
was
Jerusalem
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
the
Jews
informed
asking
for
sentence
against
him
Acts
whom
answered
that
not
the
custom
the
Romans
give
any
man
before
that
the
accused
have
the
accusers
face
face
and
have
had
opportunity
make
his
defense
concerning
the
matter
laid
against
him
Acts
When
therefore
they
were
come
together
here
made
delay
but
the
next
day
sat
the
judgment
seat
and
commanded
the
man
brought
Acts
Concerning
whom
when
the
accusers
stood
they
brought
charge
such
evil
things
supposed
Acts
but
had
certain
questions
against
him
their
own
religion
and
one
Jesus
who
was
dead
whom
Paul
affirmed
alive
Acts
And
being
perplexed
how
inquire
concerning
these
things
asked
whether
would
Jerusalem
and
there
judged
these
matters
Acts
But
when
Paul
had
appealed
kept
for
the
decision
the
emperor
commanded
him
kept
till
should
send
him
Cæsar
Acts
And
Agrippa
said
unto
Festus
also
could
wish
hear
the
man
myself
morrow
saith
thou
shalt
hear
him
Acts
the
morrow
when
Agrippa
was
come
and
Bernice
with
great
pomp
and
they
were
entered
into
the
place
hearing
with
the
chief
captains
and
principal
men
the
city
the
command
Festus
Paul
was
brought
Acts
And
Festus
saith
King
Agrippa
and
all
men
who
are
here
present
with
behold
this
man
about
whom
all
the
multitude
the
Jews
made
suit
both
Jerusalem
and
here
crying
that
ought
not
live
any
longer
Acts
But
found
that
had
committed
nothing
worthy
death
and
himself
appealed
the
emperor
determined
send
him
Acts
whom
have
certain
thing
write
unto
lord
Wherefore
have
brought
him
forth
before
you
and
specially
before
thee
king
Agrippa
that
after
examination
had
may
have
somewhat
write
Acts
For
seemeth
unreasonable
sending
prisoner
not
withal
signify
the
charges
against
him
Acts
And
Agrippa
said
unto
Paul
Thou
art
permitted
speak
for
thyself
Then
Paul
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
made
his
defence
Acts
think
myself
happy
king
Agrippa
that
make
defence
before
thee
this
day
touching
all
the
things
whereof
accused
the
Jews
Acts
especially
because
thou
art
expert
all
customs
and
questions
which
are
among
the
Jews
wherefore
beseech
thee
hear
patiently
Acts
manner
life
then
from
youth
which
was
from
the
beginning
among
mine
own
nation
and
Jerusalem
know
all
the
Jews
Acts
having
knowledge
from
the
first
they
willing
testify
that
after
the
straitest
sect
our
religion
lived
Pharisee
Acts
And
now
stand
here
judged
for
the
hope
the
promise
made
God
unto
our
fathers
Acts
unto
which
promise
our
twelve
tribes
earnestly
serving
God
night
and
day
hope
attain
And
concerning
this
hope
accused
the
Jews
king
Acts
Why
judged
incredible
with
you
God
doth
raise
the
dead
Acts
verily
thought
with
myself
that
ought
many
things
contrary
the
name
Jesus
Nazareth
Acts
And
this
also
did
Jerusalem
and
both
shut
many
the
saints
prisons
having
received
authority
from
the
chief
priests
and
when
they
were
put
death
gave
vote
against
them
Acts
And
punishing
them
oftentimes
all
the
synagogues
strove
make
them
blaspheme
and
being
exceedingly
mad
against
them
persecuted
them
even
unto
foreign
cities
Acts
Whereupon
journeyed
Damascus
with
the
authority
and
commission
the
chief
priests
Acts
midday
king
saw
the
way
light
from
heaven
above
the
brightness
the
sun
shining
round
about
and
them
that
journeyed
with
Acts
And
when
were
all
fallen
the
earth
heard
voice
saying
unto
the
Hebrew
language
Saul
Saul
why
persecutest
thou
hard
for
thee
kick
against
the
goad
Acts
And
said
Who
art
thou
Lord
And
the
Lord
said
Jesus
whom
thou
persecutest
Acts
But
arise
and
stand
upon
thy
feet
for
this
end
have
appeared
unto
thee
appoint
thee
minister
and
witness
both
the
things
wherein
thou
hast
seen
and
the
things
wherein
will
appear
unto
thee
Acts
delivering
thee
from
the
people
and
from
the
Gentiles
unto
whom
send
thee
Acts
open
their
eyes
that
they
may
turn
from
darkness
light
and
from
the
power
Satan
unto
God
that
they
may
receive
remission
sins
and
inheritance
among
them
that
are
sanctified
faith
Acts
Wherefore
king
Agrippa
was
not
disobedient
unto
the
heavenly
vision
Acts
but
declared
both
them
Damascus
first
and
Jerusalem
and
throughout
all
the
country
Judæa
and
also
the
Gentiles
that
they
should
repent
and
turn
God
doing
works
worthy
repentance
Acts
For
this
cause
the
Jews
seized
the
temple
and
assayed
kill
Acts
Having
therefore
obtained
the
help
that
from
God
stand
unto
this
day
testifying
both
small
and
great
saying
nothing
but
what
the
prophets
and
Moses
did
say
should
come
Acts
how
that
the
Christ
must
suffer
and
how
that
first
the
resurrection
the
dead
should
proclaim
light
both
the
people
and
the
Gentiles
Acts
And
thus
made
his
defence
Festus
saith
with
loud
voice
Paul
thou
art
mad
thy
much
learning
turning
thee
mad
Acts
But
Paul
saith
not
mad
most
excellent
Festus
but
speak
forth
words
truth
and
soberness
Acts
For
the
king
knoweth
these
things
unto
whom
also
speak
freely
for
persuaded
that
none
these
things
hidden
from
him
for
this
hath
not
been
done
corner
Acts
King
Agrippa
believest
thou
the
prophets
know
that
thou
believest
Acts
And
Agrippa
said
unto
Paul
With
but
little
persuasion
thou
wouldest
fain
make
Christian
Acts
And
Paul
said
would
God
that
whether
with
little
with
much
not
thou
only
but
also
all
that
hear
this
day
might
become
such
except
these
bonds
Acts
And
the
king
rose
and
the
governor
and
Bernice
and
they
that
sat
with
them
Acts
and
when
they
had
withdrawn
they
spake
one
another
saying
This
man
doeth
nothing
worthy
death
bonds
Acts
And
Agrippa
said
unto
Festus
This
man
might
have
been
set
liberty
had
not
appealed
unto
Cæsar
Acts
And
when
was
determined
that
should
sail
for
Italy
they
delivered
Paul
and
certain
other
prisoners
centurion
named
Julius
the
Augustan
band
Acts
And
embarking
ship
Adramyttium
which
was
about
sail
unto
the
places
the
coast
Asia
put
sea
Aristarchus
Macedonian
Thessalonica
being
with
Acts
And
the
next
day
touched
Sidon
and
Julius
treated
Paul
kindly
and
gave
him
leave
unto
his
friends
and
refresh
himself
Acts
And
putting
sea
from
thence
sailed
under
the
lee
Cyprus
because
the
winds
were
contrary
Acts
And
when
had
sailed
across
the
sea
which
off
Cilicia
and
Pamphylia
came
Myra
city
Lycia
Acts
And
there
the
centurion
found
ship
Alexandria
sailing
for
Italy
and
put
therein
Acts
And
when
had
sailed
slowly
many
days
and
were
come
with
difficulty
over
against
Cnidus
the
wind
not
further
suffering
sailed
under
the
lee
Crete
over
against
Salmone
Acts
and
with
difficulty
coasting
along
came
unto
certain
place
called
Fair
Havens
nigh
whereunto
was
the
city
Lasea
Acts
And
when
much
time
was
spent
and
the
voyage
was
now
dangerous
because
the
Fast
was
now
already
gone
Paul
admonished
them
Acts
and
said
unto
them
Sirs
perceive
that
the
voyage
will
with
injury
and
much
loss
not
only
the
lading
and
the
ship
but
also
our
lives
Acts
But
the
centurion
gave
more
heed
the
master
and
the
owner
the
ship
than
those
things
which
were
spoken
Paul
Acts
And
because
the
haven
was
not
commodious
winter
the
more
part
advised
put
sea
from
thence
any
means
they
could
reach
Phoenix
and
winter
there
which
haven
Crete
looking
north
east
and
south
east
Acts
And
when
the
south
wind
blew
softly
supposing
that
they
had
obtained
their
purpose
they
weighed
anchor
and
sailed
along
Crete
close
shore
Acts
But
after
long
time
there
beat
down
from
tempestuous
wind
which
called
Euraquilo
Acts
and
when
the
ship
was
caught
and
could
not
face
the
wind
gave
way
and
were
driven
Acts
And
running
under
the
lee
small
island
called
Cauda
were
able
with
difficulty
secure
the
boat
Acts
and
when
they
had
hoisted
they
used
helps
under
girding
the
ship
and
fearing
lest
they
should
cast
upon
the
Syrtis
they
lowered
the
gear
and
were
driven
Acts
And
labored
exceedingly
with
the
storm
the
next
day
they
began
throw
the
freight
overboard
Acts
and
the
third
day
they
cast
out
with
their
own
hands
the
tackling
the
ship
Acts
And
when
neither
sun
nor
stars
shone
upon
for
many
days
and
small
tempest
lay
all
hope
that
should
saved
was
now
taken
away
Acts
And
when
they
had
been
long
without
food
then
Paul
stood
forth
the
midst
them
and
said
Sirs
should
have
hearkened
unto
and
not
have
set
sail
from
Crete
and
have
gotten
this
injury
and
loss
Acts
And
now
exhort
you
good
cheer
for
there
shall
loss
life
among
you
but
only
the
ship
Acts
For
there
stood
this
night
angel
the
God
whose
whom
also
serve
Acts
saying
Fear
not
Paul
thou
must
stand
before
Cæsar
and
God
hath
granted
thee
all
them
that
sail
with
thee
Acts
Wherefore
sirs
good
cheer
for
believe
God
that
shall
even
hath
been
spoken
unto
Acts
But
must
cast
upon
certain
island
Acts
But
when
the
fourteenth
night
was
come
were
driven
and
fro
the
sea
Adria
about
midnight
the
sailors
surmised
that
they
were
drawing
near
some
country
Acts
and
they
sounded
and
found
twenty
fathoms
and
after
little
space
they
sounded
again
and
found
fifteen
fathoms
Acts
And
fearing
lest
haply
should
cast
ashore
rocky
ground
they
let
four
anchors
from
the
stern
and
wished
for
the
day
Acts
And
the
sailors
were
seeking
flee
out
the
ship
and
had
lowered
the
boat
into
the
sea
under
color
though
they
would
lay
out
anchors
from
the
foreship
Acts
Paul
said
the
centurion
and
the
soldiers
Except
these
abide
the
ship
cannot
saved
Acts
Then
the
soldiers
cut
away
the
ropes
the
boat
and
let
her
fall
off
Acts
And
while
the
day
was
coming
Paul
besought
them
all
take
some
food
saying
This
day
the
fourteenth
day
that
wait
and
continue
fasting
having
taken
nothing
Acts
Wherefore
beseech
you
take
some
food
for
this
for
your
safety
for
there
shall
not
hair
perish
from
the
head
any
you
Acts
And
when
had
said
this
and
had
taken
bread
gave
thanks
God
the
presence
all
and
brake
and
began
eat
Acts
Then
were
they
all
good
cheer
and
themselves
also
took
food
Acts
And
were
all
the
ship
two
hundred
threescore
and
sixteen
souls
Acts
And
when
they
had
eaten
enough
they
lightened
the
ship
throwing
out
the
wheat
into
the
sea
Acts
And
when
was
day
they
knew
not
the
land
but
they
perceived
certain
bay
with
beach
and
they
took
counsel
whether
they
could
drive
the
ship
upon
Acts
And
casting
off
the
anchors
they
left
them
the
sea
the
same
time
loosing
the
bands
the
rudders
and
hoisting
the
foresail
the
wind
they
made
for
the
beach
Acts
But
lighting
upon
place
where
two
seas
met
they
ran
the
vessel
aground
and
the
foreship
struck
and
remained
unmoveable
but
the
stern
began
break
the
violence
the
waves
Acts
And
the
soldiers
counsel
was
kill
the
prisoners
lest
any
them
should
swim
out
and
escape
Acts
But
the
centurion
desiring
save
Paul
stayed
them
from
their
purpose
and
commanded
that
they
who
could
swim
should
cast
themselves
overboard
and
get
first
the
land
Acts
and
the
rest
some
planks
and
some
other
things
from
the
ship
And
came
pass
that
they
all
escaped
safe
the
land
Acts
And
when
were
escaped
then
knew
that
the
island
was
called
Melita
Acts
And
the
barbarians
showed
common
kindness
for
they
kindled
fire
and
received
all
because
the
present
rain
and
because
the
cold
Acts
But
when
Paul
had
gathered
bundle
sticks
and
laid
them
the
fire
viper
came
out
reason
the
heat
and
fastened
his
hand
Acts
And
when
the
barbarians
saw
the
venomous
creature
hanging
from
his
hand
they
said
one
another
doubt
this
man
murderer
whom
though
hath
escaped
from
the
sea
yet
Justice
hath
not
suffered
live
Acts
Howbeit
shook
off
the
creature
into
the
fire
and
took
harm
Acts
But
they
expected
that
would
have
swollen
fallen
down
dead
suddenly
but
when
they
were
long
expectation
and
beheld
nothing
amiss
came
him
they
changed
their
minds
and
said
that
was
god
Acts
Now
the
neighborhood
that
place
were
lands

And

Publius
lay
sick
fever

dysentery
unto

Paul
entered

laying

And
when

were
cured
Acts

And
after
three
months
set
sail

wintered

was
The
Twin

And
touching
Syracuse

And
from
thence
the

came
meet
far
The
Market
Appius

The
Three

whom
when
Paul
saw
thanked
God
and
took
courage
Acts
And
when
entered
into
Rome
Paul
was
suffered
abide
himself
with
the
soldier
that
guarded
him
Acts
And
came
pass
that
after
three
days
called
together
those
that
were
the
chief

Jews
and
when
they
were
come
together
said
unto
them
brethren
though

done
nothing

Jerusalem
into
the
hands

who
when
they
had

desired
set

there

But
when

And
they
said
unto
him
neither
received
letters
from
Judæa
concerning
thee
nor
did
any
the

come
hither

persuading
them
concerning

from

from

And
some
believed
the
things
which

some
disbelieved
Acts
And
when
they
agreed
not
among
themselves
they
departed
after
that
Paul
had
spoken
one
word
Well

the
Holy

Wherefore

They

What

For
Abraham

For
what
saith
the

And
Abraham
believed

Romans
Now
him
that

debt
Romans
But
him
that
worketh
not
but
believeth
him
that
justifieth
the
ungodly
his

reckoned
for

Romans
Even
David
also
pronounceth
blessing
upon
the
man
unto
whom
God
reckoneth
righteousness
apart
from

Romans
saying
Blessed
are
they
whose
iniquities

forgiven
And
whose

Blessed
the
man
whom
the
Lord
will
not
reckon
sin
Romans
this
blessing
then
pronounced
upon
the
circumcision
upon
the
uncircumcision
also
for
say
Abraham
his
faith
was
reckoned
for
righteousness
Romans
How
then
was
reckoned
when
was
circumcision
uncircumcision
Not
circumcision

uncircumcision
Romans
and
received
the

the

who
not
only
are
the
circumcision
but
who
also
walk
the
steps
that
faith
our
father
Abraham
which
had
uncircumcision
Romans
For
not
through
the
law
was
the
promise
Abraham
his
seed
that
should
heir
the

through
the
righteousness
faith
Romans
For
they
that

the

made
void
and
the

made
none

for
the

worketh

For
this
cause

that
the

Abraham
who
the

all
Romans
written
father
many
nations
have
made

him
whom

God
who

Who

that

many

according
that
which

been
spoken

Romans
And
without
being
weakened
faith
considered
his
own
body
now
good
dead
being
about
hundred
years
old
and
the
deadness
Sarah
womb
Romans
yet
looking
unto
the
promise
God
wavered
not
through
unbelief
but
waxed
strong
through
faith
giving
glory
God
Romans
and
being
fully
assured
that
what
had
promised
was
able
also
perform
Romans
Wherefore

was
reckoned
unto
him
for
righteousness
Romans
Now
was
not
written
for
his
sake
alone
that
was
reckoned
unto
him
Romans
but
for
our

also
unto
whom
shall

who
believe
him
that
raised
Jesus
our
Lord
from
the
dead
Romans
who
was
delivered
for
our
trespasses
and
was
raised
for
our
justification

Being
therefore
justified

have
peace
with
God
through
our

Jesus

Romans
through
whom
also
have
had
our
access

into
this

wherein
stand
and
rejoice
hope
the
glory
God
Romans
And
not
only
but
also
rejoice
our
tribulations
knowing
that
tribulation
worketh
stedfastness
Romans
and
stedfastness
approvedness
and
approvedness
hope
Romans
and
hope
putteth
not
shame
because
the
love
God
hath
been
shed
abroad
our
hearts
through
the
Holy
Spirit
which
was
given
unto
Romans
For
while
were
yet
weak
due
season
Christ
died
for
the
ungodly
Romans
For
scarcely
for
righteous
man
will
one
die
for
peradventure
for
the
good
man
some
one
would
even
dare
die
Romans
But
God
commendeth
his
own
love
toward
that
while
were
yet
sinners
Christ
died
for
Romans
Much
more
then
being
now
justified
his
blood
shall
saved
from
the
wrath
God
through
him
Romans
For
while
were
enemies
were
reconciled
God
through
the
death
his
Son
much
more
being
reconciled
shall
saved
his
life
Romans
and
not
only
but
also
rejoice
God
through
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
through
whom
have
now
received
the
reconciliation
Romans
Therefore
through
one
man
sin
entered
into
the
world
and
death
through
sin
and
death
passed
unto
all
men
for
that
all
sinned
Romans
for
until
the
law
sin
was
the
world
but
sin
not
imputed
when
there
law
Romans
Nevertheless
death
reigned
from
Adam
until
Moses
even
over
them
that
had
not
sinned
after
the
likeness
Adam
transgression
who
figure
him
that
was
come
Romans
But
not
the
trespass
also
the
free
gift
For
the
trespass
the
one
the
many
died
much
more
did
the
grace
God
and
the
gift
the
grace
the
one
man
Jesus
Christ
abound
unto
the
many
Romans
And
not
through
one
that
sinned
the
gift
for
the
judgment
came
one
unto
condemnation
but
the
free
gift
came
many
trespasses
unto
justification
Romans
For
the
trespass
the
one
death
reigned
through
the
one
much
more
shall
they
that
receive
the
abundance
grace
and
the
gift
righteousness
reign
life
through
the
one
even
Jesus
Christ
Romans
then
through
one
trespass
the
judgment
came
unto
all
men
condemnation
even
through
one
act
righteousness
the
free
gift
came
unto
all
men
justification
life
Romans
For
through
the
one
man
disobedience
the
many
were
made
sinners
even
through
the
obedience
the
one
shall
the
many
made
righteous
Romans
And
the
law
came
besides
that
the
trespass
might
abound
but
where
sin
abounded
grace
did
abound
more
exceedingly
Romans
that
sin
reigned
death
even
might
grace
reign
through
righteousness
unto
eternal
life
through
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord
Romans
What
shall
say
then
Shall
continue
sin
that
grace
may
abound
Romans
God
forbid
who
died
sin
how
shall
any
longer
live
therein
Romans
are
ignorant
that
all
who
were
baptized
into
Christ
Jesus
were
baptized
into
his
death
Romans
were
buried
therefore
with
him
through
baptism
into
death
that
like
Christ
was
raised
from
the
dead
through
the
glory
the
Father
also
might
walk
newness
life
Romans
For
have
become
united
with
him
the
likeness
his
death
shall
also
the
likeness
his
resurrection
Romans
knowing
this
that
our
old
man
was
crucified
with
him
that
the
body
sin
might
done
away
that
should
longer
bondage
sin
Romans
for
that
hath
died
justified
from
sin
Romans
But
died
with
Christ
believe
that
shall
also
live
with
him
Romans
knowing
that
Christ
being
raised
from
the
dead
dieth
more
death
more
hath
dominion
over
him
Romans
For
the
death
that
died
died
unto
sin
once
but
the
life
that
liveth
liveth
unto
God
Romans
Even
reckon
also
yourselves
dead
unto
sin
but
alive
unto
God
Christ
Jesus
Romans
Let
not
sin
therefore
reign
your
mortal
body
that
should
obey
the
lusts
thereof
Romans
neither
present
your
members
unto
sin
instruments
unrighteousness
but
present
yourselves
unto
God
alive
from
the
dead
and
your
members
instruments
righteousness
unto
God
Romans
For
sin
shall
not
have
dominion
over
you
for
are
not
under
law
but
under
grace
Romans
What
then
shall
sin
because
are
not
under
law
but
under
grace
God
forbid
Romans
Know
not
that
whom
present
yourselves
servants
unto
obedience
his
servants
are
whom
obey
whether
sin
unto
death
obedience
unto
righteousness
Romans
But
thanks
God
that
whereas
were
servants
sin
became
obedient
from
the
heart
that
form
teaching
whereunto
were
delivered
Romans
and
being
made
free
from
sin
became
servants
righteousness
Romans
speak
after
the
manner
men
because
the
infirmity
your
flesh
for
presented
your
members
servants
uncleanness
and
iniquity
unto
iniquity
even
now
present
your
members
servants
righteousness
unto
sanctification
Romans
For
when
were
servants
sin
were
free
regard
righteousness
Romans
What
fruit
then
had
that
time
the
things
whereof
are
now
ashamed
for
the
end
those
things
death
Romans
But
now
being
made
free
from
sin
and
become
servants
God
have
your
fruit
unto
sanctification
and
the
end
eternal
life
Romans
For
the
wages
sin
death
but
the
free
gift
God
eternal
life
Christ
Jesus
our
Lord
Romans
are
ignorant
brethren
for
speak
men
who
know
the
law
that
the
law
hath
dominion
over
man
for
long
time
liveth
Romans
For
the
woman
that
hath
husband
bound
law
the
husband
while
liveth
but
the
husband
die
she
discharged
from
the
law
the
husband
Romans
then
while
the
husband
liveth
she
joined
another
man
she
shall
called
adulteress
but
the
husband
die
she
free
from
the
law
that
she
adulteress
though
she
joined
another
man
Romans
Wherefore
brethren
also
were
made
dead
the
law
through
the
body
Christ
that
should
joined
another
even
him
who
was
raised
from
the
dead
that
might
bring
forth
fruit
unto
God
Romans
For
when
were
the
flesh
the
sinful
passions
which
were
through
the
law
wrought
our
members
bring
forth
fruit
unto
death
Romans
But
now
have
been
discharged
from
the
law
having
died
that
wherein
were
held
that
serve
newness
the
spirit
and
not
oldness
the
letter
Romans
What
shall
say
then
the
law
sin
God
forbid
Howbeit
had
not
known
sin
except
through
the
law
for
had
not
known
coveting
except
the
law
had
said
Thou
shalt
not
covet
Romans
but
sin
finding
occasion
wrought
through
the
commandment
all
manner
coveting
for
apart
from
the
law
sin
dead
Romans
And
was
alive
apart
from
the
law
once
but
when
the
commandment
came
sin
revived
and
died
Romans
and
the
commandment
which
was
unto
life
this
found
unto
death
Romans
for
sin
finding
occasion
through
the
commandment
beguiled
and
through
slew
Romans
that
the
law
holy
and
the
commandment
holy
and
righteous
and
good
Romans
Did
then
that
which
good
become
death
unto
God
forbid
But
sin
that
might
shown
sin
working
death
through
that
which
good
that
through
the
commandment
sin
might
become
exceeding
sinful
Romans
For
know
that
the
law
spiritual
but
carnal
sold
under
sin
Romans
For
that
which
know
not
for
not
what
would
that
practise
but
what
hate
that
Romans
But
what
would
not
that
consent
unto
the
law
that
good
Romans
now
more
that
but
sin
which
dwelleth
Romans
For
know
that
that

dwelleth
good
thing
for

present

but
that
which

For
the
good
which

not

Romans
But
what

not
that
more
that
but
sin
which
dwelleth
Romans
find
then
the
law
that
who
would
good
evil
present
Romans
For
delight
the

God
after
the
inward
man
Romans
but
see
different
law
members
warring
against
the
law
mind
and
bringing
into
captivity
under
the
law
sin
which
members
Romans
Wretched
man
that
who
shall
deliver
out
the
body
this
death
Romans
thank
God
through
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord
then
myself
with
the
mind
indeed
serve
the
law
God
but
with
the
flesh
the
law
sin
Romans
There
therefore
now
condemnation
them
that
are
Christ
Jesus
Romans
For
the
law
the
Spirit
life
Christ
Jesus
made
free
from
the
law
sin
and
death
Romans
For
what
the
law
could
not
that
was
weak
through
the
flesh
God
sending
his
own
Son
the
likeness
sinful
flesh
and
for
sin
condemned
sin
the
flesh
Romans
that
the
ordinance
the
law
might
fulfilled
who
walk
not
after
the
flesh
but
after
the
Spirit
Romans
For
they
that
are
after
the
flesh
mind
the
things
the

but
they
that
are
after
the
Spirit
the
things
the

Romans
For
the
mind
the
flesh
death
but
the

the

life
and
peace
Romans
because
the
mind
the
flesh
enmity
against
God
for
not
subject
the
law
God
neither
indeed
can
Romans
and
they
that
are
the
flesh
cannot
please
God
Romans
But
are
not
the
flesh
but
the

that
the
Spirit
God
dwelleth
you
But
any
man
hath
not
the

Christ
none

Romans
And
Christ
you
the

dead
because
sin

Romans
But
the

him
that
raised
Jesus
from

dwelleth
you
that
raised
Christ
Jesus
from

shall
give
life
also
your

through

that
dwelleth

Romans
then
brethren
are
debtors
not
the

live
after

Romans
for
live
after
the
flesh
must
die
but
the

put
death
the
deeds
the
body
shall
live
Romans
For
many
are
led
the
Spirit
God
these
are
sons
God
Romans
For
received
not
the
spirit
bondage
again
unto
fear
but
received
the
spirit
adoption
whereby
cry
Abba
Father
Romans
The
Spirit
himself
beareth
witness
with
our
spirit
that
are
children
God
Romans
and
children
then
heirs
heirs
God
and
joint
heirs
with
Christ
that
suffer
with
him
that
may
also
glorified
with
him
Romans
For
reckon
that
the
sufferings
this
present
time
are
not
worthy
compared
with
the
glory
which
shall
revealed
ward
Romans
For
the
earnest
expectation
the
creation
waiteth
for
the
revealing
the
sons
God
Romans
For
the
creation
was
subjected
vanity
not
its
own
will
but
reason
him
who
subjected
hope
Romans
that
the
creation
itself
also
shall
delivered
from
the
bondage
corruption
into
the
liberty
the
glory
the
children
God
Romans
For
know
that
the
whole
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
pain
together
until
now
Romans
And
not
only
but
ourselves
also
who
have
the
first
fruits
the
Spirit
even
ourselves
groan
within
ourselves
waiting
for
our
adoption
wit
the
redemption
our
body
Romans
For
hope
were
saved
but
hope
that
seen
not
hope
for
who
hopeth
for
that
which
seeth
Romans
But
hope
for
that
which
see
not
then
with
patience
wait
for
Romans
And
like
manner
the
Spirit
also
helpeth
our
infirmity
for
know
not
how
pray
ought
but
the
Spirit
himself
maketh
intercession
for
with
groanings
which
cannot
uttered
Romans
and
that
searcheth
the
hearts
knoweth
what
the
mind
the
Spirit
because
maketh
intercession
for
the
saints
according
the
will
God
Romans
And
know
that
them
that
love
God
all
things
work
together
for
good
even
them
that
are
called
according
his
purpose
Romans
For
whom
foreknew
also
foreordained
conformed
the
image
his
Son
that
might
the
firstborn
among
many
brethren
Romans
and
whom
foreordained
them
also
called

whom
called
them
also
justified
and
whom
justified
them
also
glorified
Romans
What
then
shall
say
these
things
God
for
who
against
Romans
that
spared
not
his
own
Son
but
delivered
him
for
all
how
shall
not
also
with
him
freely
give
all
things
Romans
Who
shall
lay
anything
the
charge
God
elect
God
that
justifieth
Romans
who
that
condemneth

that

rather
that

who

Who

Even
written
For

Romans
Nay
all
these
things
are
more
than
conquerors
through
him
that

For
persuaded
that
neither

Romans
nor

lie

bearing

Romans
that

Romans
For
could
wish
that
myself
were
anathema
from
Christ
for

kinsmen
according
the

Romans
who
are
Israelites
whose

Amen
Romans
But
not
though
the

nought
For
they
are
not
all
Israel
that

Romans
neither
because
they

Abraham

Isaac

That
not

For

According

And
not

Rebecca

having

for
the

bad
that

was
said
unto
her
The

Romans
Even
written
Jacob
loved

Esau
hated
Romans
What
shall
say
then
there
unrighteousness
with
God
God
forbid
Romans
For
saith
Moses
will
have
mercy
whom
have
mercy
and
will
have
compassion
whom
have
compassion
Romans
then
not
him
that
willeth
nor
him
that
runneth
but
God
that
hath
mercy
Romans
For
the
scripture
saith
unto
Pharaoh
For
this
very
purpose
did
raise
thee
that
might
show
thee
power
and
that
name
might

Romans
then
hath
mercy
whom

hardeneth
Romans
Thou
wilt
say
then
unto
Why
doth
still
find
fault
For
who
withstandeth
his
will
Romans
Nay
but
man
who
art
thou
that
repliest
against
God
Shall
the

formed
say
him
that
formed
Why
didst
thou
make
thus
Romans
hath
not
the
potter
right
over

vessel

unto

Romans
What
God
willing
show
his
wrath
and
make
his
power
known
endured
with
much
longsuffering
vessels
wrath
fitted
unto
destruction
Romans
and
that

make
known
the
riches
his
glory
upon
vessels
mercy
which
afore
prepared
unto
glory
Romans
even
whom
also
called
not
from
the
Jews
only
but
also
from
the
Gentiles
Romans
saith
also
Hosea
will
call
that
people
which
was
not
people
And
her
beloved
that
was
not
beloved
Romans
And
shall
that
the
place
where
was
said
unto
them
are
not
people
There
shall
they
called
sons
the
living
God
Romans
And
Isaiah
crieth
concerning
Israel
the
number
the
children
Israel
the
sand
the
sea
the
remnant
that
shall
saved
Romans
for
the
Lord
will
execute
his
word
upon
the
earth
finishing
and
cutting
short
Romans
And
Isaiah
hath
said
before
Except
the
Lord
Sabaoth
had
left
seed
had
become
Sodom
and
had
been
made
like
unto
Gomorrah
Romans
What
shall
say
then
That
the
Gentiles
who
followed
not
after
righteousness
attained
righteousness
even
the
righteousness
which
faith
Romans
but
Israel
following
after
law
righteousness
did
not
arrive
that
law
Romans
Wherefore
Because
they
sought
not
faith
but
were
works
They
stumbled
the
stone
stumbling
Romans
even
written
Behold
lay
Zion
stone
stumbling
and

offence
And
that
believeth
him
shall
not
put

Romans
Brethren
heart
desire
and
supplication
God
for
them
that
they
may
saved
Romans
For
bear
them
witness
that
they
have
zeal
for
God
but
not
according
knowledge
Romans
For
being
ignorant
God
righteousness
and
seeking
establish
their
own
they
did
not
subject
themselves
the
righteousness
God
Romans
For
Christ
the
end
the
law
unto
righteousness
every
one
that
believeth
Romans
For
Moses
writeth
that
the
man
that
doeth
the
righteousness
which
the
law
shall
live
thereby
Romans
But
the
righteousness
which
faith
saith
thus
Say
not
thy
heart
Who
shall
ascend
into
heaven
that
bring
Christ
down
Romans
Who
shall
descend
into
the
abyss
that
bring
Christ
from
the
dead
Romans
But
what
saith
The
word
nigh
thee
thy
mouth
and
thy
heart
that
the
word
faith
which
preach
Romans
because
thou
shalt
confess
with
thy
mouth
Jesus
Lord
and
shalt
believe
thy
heart
that
God
raised

from

Romans
for
with
the
heart
man

unto
righteousness
and
with
the
mouth
confession
made
unto
salvation
Romans
For
the
scripture
saith
Whosoever
believeth
him
shall
not
put
shame
Romans
For
there
distinction
between
Jew
and
Greek
for
the
same
Lord
Lord
all
and
rich
unto
all
that
call
upon
him
Romans
for
Whosoever
shall
call
upon
the
name
the
Lord
shall
saved
Romans
How
then
shall
they
call
him
whom
they
have
not
believed
and
how
shall
they
believe
him
whom
they
have
not
heard
and
how
shall
they
hear
without
preacher
Romans
and
how
shall
they
preach
except
they
sent
even
written
How
beautiful
are
the
feet
them
that
bring
glad
tidings
good
things
Romans
But
they
did
not
all
hearken
the
glad
tidings
For
Isaiah
saith
Lord
who
hath
believed
our
report
Romans
belief
cometh
hearing
and
hearing
the
word
Christ
Romans
But
say
Did
they
not
hear
Yea
verily
Their
sound
went
out
into
all
the
earth
And
their
words
unto
the
ends
the
world
Romans
But
say
Did
Israel
not
know
First
Moses
saith
will
provoke
you
jealousy
with
that
which
nation
With
nation
void
understanding
will
anger
you
Romans
And
Isaiah
very
bold
and
saith
was
found
them
that
sought
not
became
manifest
unto
them
that
asked
not
Romans
But
Israel
saith
All
the
day
long
did
spread
out
hands
unto
disobedient
and
gainsaying
people
Romans
say
then
Did
God
cast
off
his
people
God
forbid
For
also
Israelite
the
seed
Abraham
the
tribe
Benjamin
Romans
God
did
not
cast
off
his
people
which
foreknew
know
not
what
the
scripture
saith
Elijah
how
pleadeth
with
God
against
Israel
Romans
Lord
they
have
killed
thy
prophets
they
have
digged
down
thine
altars
and
left
alone
and
they
seek
life
Romans
But
what
saith
the
answer
God
unto
him
have
left
for
myself
seven
thousand
men
who
have
not
bowed
the
knee
Baal
Romans
Even
then
this
present
time
also
there
remnant
according
the
election
grace
Romans
But
grace
more
works
otherwise
grace
more
grace
Romans
What
then
That
which
Israel
seeketh
for
that
obtained
not
but
the
election
obtained
and
the
rest
were
hardened
Romans
according
written
God
gave
them
spirit
stupor
eyes
that
they
should
not
see
and
ears
that
they
should
not
hear
unto
this
very
day
Romans
And
David
saith
Let
their
table
made
snare
and
trap
And
stumblingblock
and
recompense
unto
them
Romans
Let
their
eyes
darkened
that
they
may
not
see
And
bow
thou
down
their
back
always
Romans
say
then
Did
they
stumble
that
they
might
fall
God
forbid
but
their
fall
salvation
come
unto
the
Gentiles
provoke
them
jealousy
Romans
Now
their
fall
the
riches
the
world
and
their
loss
the
riches
the
Gentiles
how
much
more
their
fulness
Romans
But
speak
you
that
are
Gentiles
Inasmuch
then
apostle
Gentiles
glorify
ministry
Romans
any
means
may
provoke
jealousy
them
that
are
flesh
and
may
save
some
them
Romans
For
the
casting
away
them
the
reconciling
the
world
what
shall
the
receiving
them
but
life
from
the
dead
Romans
And
the
firstfruit
holy
the
lump
and
the
root
holy
are
the
branches
Romans
But
some
the
branches
were
broken
off
and
thou
being
wild
olive
wast
grafted
among
them
and
didst
become
partaker
with
them
the
root
the
fatness
the
olive
tree
Romans
glory
not
over
the
branches
but
thou
gloriest
not
thou
that
bearest
the
root
but
the
root
thee
Romans
Thou
wilt
say
then
Branches
were
broken
off
that
might
grafted
Romans
Well
their
unbelief
they
were
broken
off
and
thou
standest
thy
faith
not
highminded
but
fear
Romans
for
God
spared
not
the
natural
branches
neither
will
spare
thee
Romans
Behold
then
the
goodness
and
severity
God
toward
them
that
fell
severity
but
toward
thee
God
goodness
thou
continue
his
goodness
otherwise
thou
also
shalt
cut
off
Romans
And
they
also
they
continue
not
their
unbelief
shall
grafted
for
God
able
graft
them
again
Romans
For
thou
wast
cut
out
that
which
nature

olive
tree
and
wast
grafted
contrary
nature
into
good
olive
tree
how
much
more
shall
these
which
are
the
natural
branches
grafted
into
their
own
olive
tree
Romans
For
would
not
brethren
have
you
ignorant
this
mystery
lest
wise
your
own
conceits
that
hardening
part
hath
befallen
Israel
until
the
fulness
the
Gentiles
come
Romans
and
all
Israel
shall

even
written
There
shall
come
out
Zion
the
Deliverer
shall
turn
away
ungodliness
from
Jacob
Romans
And
this
covenant
unto
them
When
shall
take
away
their
sins
Romans
touching
the
gospel
they
are
enemies
for
your
sake
but
touching
the
election
they
are
beloved
for
the
fathers
sake
Romans
For
the
gifts
and
the
calling
God
are
not
repented
Romans
For
time
past
were
disobedient
God
but
now
have
obtained
mercy
their
disobedience
Romans
even
have
these
also
now
been
disobedient
that
the
mercy
shown
you
they
also
may
now
obtain
mercy
Romans
For
God
hath
shut
all
unto
disobedience
that
might
have
mercy
upon
all
Romans
the
depth
the
riches
both

wisdom
and

how
unsearchable

For
who

Romans
who

For

For

For

Avenge

Let

Therefore

For

Wherefore

For

Now

Let

Wherefore

For
say
that
Christ
hath
been
made
minister

confirm
the

Rejoice

And

Praise

Isaiah

There

And
myself

are
full

Romans
But
write
the
more
boldly
unto
you
some
measure
putting
you
again

because
the

God
Romans
that

minister

For
will
not
dare

any

save
those
which

wrought
through
for
the
obedience

Romans
the
power

from

yea
making
aim
preach
the
gospel
not
where
Christ
was
already
named

foundation
Romans

They
shall
see
whom

came
And
they
who

Wherefore
also
was
hindered
these
many
times
from
coming

Romans
but
now
having
more
any

these
regions
and
having
these
many

longing
come
unto
you
Romans
whensoever
unto

for
hope
see
you
journey
and
brought

thitherward
you
first
some
measure
shall
have
been
satisfied
with
your
company
Romans
but
now
say
unto
Jerusalem
ministering
unto
the
saints
Romans
For
hath
been
the
good
pleasure

Achaia

certain
contribution
for
the
poor

Romans
Yea
hath
been
their

For
the

When

thank

always
concerning

which

Corinthians
that
everything

all

all

Corinthians
even
the

confirmed
you
Corinthians
that
come
behind

waiting
for
the

our

Corinthians
who

also
confirm
you
unto
the
end
that

our

Corinthians
God
faithful
through

called
into

his
Son
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord
Corinthians
Now
beseech
you
brethren
through
the
name
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
that
all
speak
the
same
thing
and
that
there
divisions
among
you
but
that
perfected
together
the
same
mind
and
the
same
judgment
Corinthians
For
hath
been
signified
unto
concerning
you
brethren
them
that
are
the
household
Chloe
that
there
are
contentions
among
you
Corinthians
Now
this
mean
that
each
one
you
saith
Paul
and
Apollos
and
Cephas
and
Christ
Corinthians
Christ
divided
was
Paul
crucified
for
you
were
baptized
into
the
name
Paul
Corinthians
thank
God
that
baptized
none
you
save
Crispus
and
Gaius
Corinthians
lest
any
man
should
say
that
were
baptized
into
name
Corinthians
And
baptized
also
the
household
Stephanas
besides
know
not
whether
baptized
any
other
Corinthians
For
Christ
sent
not
baptize
but
preach
the
gospel
not
wisdom
words
lest
the
cross
Christ
should
made
void
Corinthians
For
the
word
the
cross
them
that
perish
foolishness
but
unto
who
are
saved
the
power
God
Corinthians
For
written
will
destroy
the
wisdom
the
wise
And
the
discernment
the
discerning
will
bring
nought
Corinthians
Where
the
wise
where
the
scribe
where
the
disputer
this
world
hath
not
God
made
foolish
the
wisdom
the
world
Corinthians
For
seeing
that
the
wisdom
God
the
world
through
its
wisdom
knew
not
God
was
God
good
pleasure
through
the
foolishness
the
preaching
save
them
that
believe
Corinthians
Seeing
that
Jews
ask
for
signs
and
Greeks
seek
after
wisdom
Corinthians
but
preach
Christ
crucified
unto
Jews
stumblingblock
and
unto
Gentiles
foolishness
Corinthians
but
unto
them
that
are
called
both
Jews
and
Greeks
Christ
the
power
God
and
the
wisdom
God
Corinthians
Because
the
foolishness
God
wiser
than
men
and
the
weakness
God
stronger
than
men
Corinthians
For
behold
your
calling
brethren
that
not
many
wise
after
the
flesh
not
many
mighty
not
many
noble
are
called
Corinthians
but
God
chose
the
foolish
things
the
world
that
might
put
shame
them
that
are
wise
and
God
chose
the
weak
things
the
world
that
might
put
shame
the
things
that
are
strong
Corinthians
and
the
base
things
the
world
and
the
things
that
are
despised
did
God
choose
yea
and
the
things
that
are
not
that
might
bring
nought
the
things
that
are
Corinthians
that
flesh
should
glory
before
God
Corinthians
But
him
are
Christ
Jesus
who
was
made
unto
wisdom
from
God
and
righteousness
and
sanctification
and
redemption
Corinthians
that
according
written
that
glorieth
let
him
glory
the
Lord
Corinthians
And
brethren
when
came
unto
you
came
not
with
excellency
speech
wisdom
proclaiming
you
the
testimony
God
Corinthians
For
determined
not
know
anything
among
you
save
Jesus
Christ
and
him
crucified
Corinthians
And
was
with
you
weakness
and
fear
and
much
trembling
Corinthians
And
speech
and
preaching
were
not
persuasive
words
wisdom
but
demonstration
the
Spirit
and
power
Corinthians
that
your
faith
should
not
stand
the
wisdom
men
but
the
power
God
Corinthians
speak
wisdom
however
among
them
that
are
fullgrown
yet
wisdom
not
this
world
nor
the
rulers
this
world
who
are
coming
nought
Corinthians
but
speak
God
wisdom
mystery
even
the
wisdom
that
hath
been
hidden
which
God
foreordained
before
the
worlds
unto
our
glory
Corinthians
which
none
the
rulers
this
world
hath
known
for
had
they
known
they
would
not
have
crucified
the
Lord
glory
Corinthians
but
written
Things
which
eye
saw
not
and
ear
heard
not
And
which
entered
not
into
the
heart
man
Whatsoever
things
God
prepared
for
them
that
love
him
Corinthians
But
unto
God
revealed
them
through
the
Spirit
for
the
Spirit
searcheth
all
things
yea
the
deep
things
God
Corinthians
For
who
among
men
knoweth
the
things
man
save
the
spirit
the
man
which
him
even
the
things
God
none
knoweth
save
the
Spirit
God
Corinthians
But
received
not
the
spirit
the
world
but
the
spirit
which
from
God
that
might
know
the
things
that
were
freely
given
God
Corinthians
Which
things
also
speak
not
words
which
man
wisdom
teacheth
but
which
the
Spirit
teacheth
combining
spiritual
things
with
spiritual
words
Corinthians
Now
the
natural
man
receiveth
not
the
things
the
Spirit
God
for
they
are
foolishness
unto
him
and
cannot
know
them
because
they
are
spiritually
judged
Corinthians
But
that
spiritual
judgeth
all
things
and
himself
judged
man
Corinthians
For
who
hath
known
the
mind
the
Lord
that
should
instruct
him
But
have
the
mind
Christ
Corinthians
And
brethren
could
not
speak
unto
you
unto
spiritual
but
unto
carnal
unto
babes
Christ
Corinthians
fed
you
with
milk
not
with
meat
for
were
not
yet
able
bear
nay
not
even
now
are
able
Corinthians
for
are
yet
carnal
for
whereas
there
among
you
jealousy
and
strife
are
not
carnal
and
not
walk
after
the
manner
men
Corinthians
For
when
one
saith
Paul
and
another
Apollos
are
not
men
Corinthians
What
then
Apollos
and
what
Paul
Ministers
through
whom
believed
and
each
the
Lord
gave
him
Corinthians
planted
Apollos
watered
but
God
gave
the
increase
Corinthians
then
neither
that
planteth
anything
neither
that
watereth
but
God
that
giveth
the
increase
Corinthians
Now
that
planteth
and
that
watereth
are
one
but
each
shall
receive
his
own
reward
according
his
own
labor
Corinthians
For
are
God
fellow
workers
are
God
husbandry
God
building
Corinthians
According
the
grace
God
which
was
given
unto
wise
masterbuilder
laid
foundation
and
another
buildeth
thereon
But
let
each
man
take
heed
how
buildeth
thereon
Corinthians
For
other
foundation
can
man
lay
than
that
which
laid
which
Jesus
Christ
Corinthians
But
any
man
buildeth
the
foundation
gold
silver
costly
stones
wood
hay
stubble
Corinthians
each
man
work
shall
made
manifest
for
the
day
shall
declare
because
revealed
fire
and
the
fire
itself
shall
prove
each
man
work
what
sort
Corinthians
any
man
work
shall
abide
which
built
thereon
shall
receive
reward
Corinthians
any
man
work
shall
burned
shall
suffer
loss
but
himself
shall
saved
yet
through
fire
Corinthians
Know
not
that
are
temple
God
and
that
the
Spirit
God
dwelleth
you
Corinthians
any
man
destroyeth
the
temple
God
him
shall
God
destroy
for
the
temple
God
holy
and
such
are
Corinthians
Let
man
deceive
himself
any
man
thinketh
that
wise
among
you
this
world
let
him
become
fool
that
may
become
wise
Corinthians
For
the
wisdom
this
world
foolishness
with
God
For
written
that
taketh
the
wise
their
craftiness
Corinthians
and
again
The
Lord
knoweth
the
reasonings
the
wise
that
they
are
vain
Corinthians
Wherefore
let
one
glory
men
For
all
things
are
yours
Corinthians
whether
Paul
Apollos
Cephas
the
world
life
death
things
present
things
come
all
are
yours
Corinthians
and
are
Christ
and
Christ
God
Corinthians
Let
man
account
ministers
Christ
and
stewards
the
mysteries
God
Corinthians
Here
moreover
required
stewards
that
man
found
faithful
Corinthians
But
with
very
small
thing
that
should
judged
you
man
judgment
yea
judge
not
mine
own
self
Corinthians
For
know
nothing
against
myself
yet
not
hereby
justified
but
that
judgeth
the
Lord
Corinthians
Wherefore
judge
nothing
before
the
time
until
the
Lord
come
who
will
both
bring
light
the
hidden
things
darkness
and
make
manifest
the
counsels
the
hearts
and
then
shall
each
man
have
his
praise
from
God
Corinthians
Now
these
things
brethren
have
figure
transferred
myself
and
Apollos
for
your
sakes
that
might
learn
not
beyond
the
things
which
are
written
that
one
you
puffed
for
the
one
against
the
other
Corinthians
For
who
maketh
thee
differ
and
what
hast
thou
that
thou
didst
not
receive
but
thou
didst
receive
why
dost
thou
glory
thou
hadst
not
received
Corinthians
Already
are
filled
already
are
become
rich
have
come
reign
without
yea
and
would
that
did
reign
that
also
might
reign
with
you
Corinthians
For
think
God
hath
set
forth
the
apostles
last
all
men
doomed
death
for
are
made
spectacle
unto
the
world
both
angels
and
men
Corinthians
are
fools
for
Christ
sake
but
are
wise
Christ
are
weak
but
are
strong
have
glory
but
have
dishonor
Corinthians
Even
unto
this
present
hour
both
hunger
and
thirst
and
are
naked
and
are
buffeted
and
have
certain
dwelling
place
Corinthians
and

working
with
our

being
reviled

being
persecuted

Corinthians
being
defamed

are
made
the
filth
the

the
offscouring
all

even
until
now
Corinthians
write
not
these
things
shame
you
but
admonish
you
beloved
children
Corinthians
For
though
have
ten
thousand
tutors
Christ
yet
have
not
many
fathers
for
Christ
Jesus
begat
you
through
the
gospel
Corinthians
beseech
you
therefore
imitators
Corinthians
For
this
cause
have
sent
unto
you
Timothy
who
beloved
and
faithful
child
the
Lord
who
shall
put
you

ways
which
are
Christ
even
teach
everywhere
every
church
Corinthians
Now
some
are
puffed
though
were
not
coming
you
Corinthians
But
will
come
you
shortly
the
Lord
will
and
will
know
not
the
word
them
that
are
puffed
but
the
power
Corinthians
For
the
kingdom
God
not
word
but
power
Corinthians
What
will
shall
come
unto
you
with
rod
love
and
spirit
gentleness
Corinthians
actually
reported
that
there
fornication
among
you
and
such
fornication
not
even
among
the
Gentiles
that
one
you
hath
his
father
wife
Corinthians
And
are
puffed
and
did
not
rather
mourn
that
that
had
done
this
deed
might
taken
away
from
among
you
Corinthians
For
verily
being
absent
body
but
present
spirit
have
already
though
were
present
judged
him
that
hath
wrought
this
thing
Corinthians
the
name
our
Lord
Jesus
being
gathered
together
and
spirit
with
the
power
our
Lord
Jesus
Corinthians
deliver
such
one
unto
Satan
for
the
destruction
the
flesh
that
the

Corinthians
Your

Know

little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole

Corinthians
Purge
out
the
old
leaven
that
may
new
lump
even
are
unleavened
For
our
passover
also
hath
been
sacrificed
even
Christ
Corinthians
wherefore
let
keep
the
feast
not
with
old
leaven
neither
with
the
leaven
malice
and
wickedness
but
with
the
unleavened
bread
sincerity
and
truth
Corinthians
wrote
unto
you
epistle
have
company
with
fornicators
Corinthians
not
all
meaning
with
the
fornicators
this
world
with
the
covetous
and
extortioners
with
idolaters
for
then
must
needs

Corinthians
but

For
what

Corinthians
But
them
that

God
judgeth
Put
away
the
wicked
man
from

Corinthians
Dare
any

having
matter

his
neighbor
law
before
the
unrighteous
and
not
before
the

Corinthians
know
not
that
the
saints
shall
judge
the
world
and
the
world
judged
you
are
unworthy
judge
the
smallest
matters
Corinthians
Know
not
that
shall
judge
angels
how
much
more
things
that

Corinthians
then
have
judge
things
pertaining
this
life
set

the

Corinthians
say
this
move
you
shame
What
cannot
there
found
among
you
one
wise
man
who
shall
able
decide
between
his
brethren
Corinthians
but
brother
goeth
law
with

and
that
before
unbelievers
Corinthians
Nay
already
altogether
defect
you
that
have
lawsuits
one
with
another
Why
not
rather
take
wrong
why
not
rather
defrauded
Corinthians
Nay
but
yourselves
wrong
and
defraud
and
that
your
brethren
Corinthians
know
not
that
the
unrighteous
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
God
not
deceived
neither
fornicators
nor
idolaters
nor
adulterers
nor
effeminate
nor
abusers
themselves
with
men
Corinthians
nor
thieves
nor
covetous
nor
drunkards
nor

nor

God
Corinthians
And
such
were
some
you
but
were
washed
but
were
sanctified
but
were
justified
the
name
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
the
Spirit
our
God
Corinthians
All
things
are
lawful
for

not
all

expedient
All
things
are
lawful
for
but
will
not
brought
under
the
power
any
Corinthians
Meats
for
the
belly
and
the
belly
for
meats
but
God
shall
bring
nought
both
and
them
But
the
body
not
for
fornication
but
for
the
Lord
and
the
Lord
for
the
body
Corinthians
and
God
both
raised
the
Lord
and
will
raise
through
his
power
Corinthians
Know
not
that
your
bodies
are
members
Christ
shall
then
take
away
the
members
Christ
and
make
them
members
harlot
God
forbid
Corinthians
know
not
that
that

harlot
one
body
for
The

one
flesh
Corinthians
But
that
joined
unto
the
Lord
one

Corinthians
Flee
fornication
Every
sin
that
man
doeth
without
the
body
but
that
committeth
fornication
sinneth
against
his
own
body
Corinthians
know
not
that
your

temple
the
Holy

which
you
which
have
from
God
and
are
not
your

Corinthians
for

glorify
God
therefore
your
body
Corinthians
Now
concerning
the
things
whereof
wrote
good
for
man
not
touch
woman
Corinthians
But
because
fornications
let
each
man
have
his
own
wife
and
let
each
woman
have
her
own
husband
Corinthians
Let
the
husband
render
unto
the
wife
her
due
and
likewise
also
the
wife
unto
the
husband
Corinthians
The
wife
hath
not
power
over
her

body
but
the
husband
and
likewise
also
the

hath
not
power
over

Corinthians
Defraud

together
again
that
Satan
tempt
you
not
because
your
incontinency
Corinthians
But
this
say
way
concession
not
commandment
Corinthians
Yet
would
that
all
men
were
even
myself
Howbeit
each
man
hath
his
own
gift
from
God
one
after
this
manner
and
another
after
that
Corinthians
But
say
the
unmarried
and
widows
good
for
them
they
abide
even
Corinthians
But
they
have
not
continency
let
them
marry
for
better
marry
than
burn
Corinthians
But
unto
the
married
give
charge
yea
not
but
the
Lord
That
the
wife
depart
not
from
her
husband
Corinthians
but
should
she
depart
let
her
remain
unmarried
else
reconciled
her
husband
and
that
the
husband
leave
not
his
wife
Corinthians
But
the
rest
say
not
the
Lord
any
brother
hath
unbelieving
wife
and
she
content
dwell
with
him
let
him
not
leave
her
Corinthians
And
the
woman
that
hath
unbelieving
husband
and
content
dwell
with
her
let
her
not
leave
her
husband
Corinthians
For
the
unbelieving
husband
sanctified
the
wife
and
the
unbelieving
wife
sanctified
the
brother
else
were
your
children
unclean
but
now
are
they
holy
Corinthians
Yet
the
unbelieving
departeth
let
him
depart
the
brother
the
sister
not
under
bondage
such
cases
but
God
hath
called
peace
Corinthians
For
how
knowest
thou
wife
whether
thou
shalt
save
thy
husband
how
knowest
thou
husband
whether
thou
shalt
save
thy
wife
Corinthians
Only
the
Lord
hath
distributed
each
man
God
hath
called
each
let
him
walk
And
ordain
all
the
churches
Corinthians
Was
any
man
called
being
circumcised
let
him
not
become
uncircumcised
Hath
any
been
called
uncircumcision
let
him
not
circumcised
Corinthians
Circumcision
nothing
and
uncircumcision
nothing
but
the
keeping
the
commandments
God
Corinthians
Let
each
man
abide
that
calling
wherein
was
called
Corinthians
Wast
thou
called
being
bondservant
care
not
for
nay
even
thou
canst
become
free
use
rather
Corinthians
For
that
was
called
the
Lord
being
bondservant
the
Lord
freedman
likewise
that
was
called
being
free
Christ
bondservant
Corinthians
were
bought
with
price
become
not
bondservants
men
Corinthians
Brethren
let
each
man
wherein
was
called
therein
abide
with
God
Corinthians
Now
concerning
virgins
have
commandment
the
Lord
but
give
judgment
one
that
hath
obtained
mercy
the
Lord
trustworthy
Corinthians
think
therefore
that
this
good
reason
the
distress
that
upon
namely
that
good
for
man
Corinthians
Art
thou
bound
unto
wife
seek
not
loosed
Art
thou
loosed
from
wife
seek
not
wife
Corinthians
But
shouldest
thou
marry
thou
hast
not
sinned
and
virgin
marry
she
hath
not
sinned
Yet
such
shall
have
tribulation
the
flesh
and
would
spare
you
Corinthians
But
this
say
brethren
the
time
shortened
that
henceforth
both
those
that
have
wives
may
though
they
had
none
Corinthians
and
those
that
weep
though
they
wept
not
and
those
that
rejoice
though
they
rejoiced
not
and
those
that
buy
though
they
possessed
not
Corinthians
and
those
that
use
the
world
not
using
the
full
for
the
fashion
this
world
passeth
away
Corinthians
But
would
have
you
free
from
cares
that
unmarried
careful
for
the
things
the
Lord
how
may
please
the
Lord
Corinthians
but
that
married
careful
for
the
things
the
world
how
may
please
his
wife
Corinthians
and
divided
also
the
woman
that
unmarried
and
the
virgin
careful
for
the
things
the
Lord
that
she
may
holy
both
body
and
spirit
but
she
that
married
careful
for
the
things
the
world
how
she
may
please
her
husband
Corinthians
And
this
say
for
your
own
profit
not
that
may
cast
snare
upon
you
but
for
that
which
seemly
and
that
may
attend
upon
the
Lord
without
distraction
Corinthians
But
any
man
thinketh
that
behaveth
himself
unseemly
toward
his
virgin
daughter
she
past
the
flower
her
age
and
need
requireth
let
him
what
will
sinneth
not
let
them
marry
Corinthians
But
that
standeth
stedfast
his
heart
having
necessity
but
hath
power
touching
his
own
will
and
hath
determined
this
his
own
heart
keep
his
own
virgin
daughter
shall
well
Corinthians
then
both
that
giveth
his
own
virgin
daughter
marriage
doeth
well
and
that
giveth
her
not
marriage
shall
better
Corinthians
wife
bound
for
long
time
her
husband
liveth
but
the
husband
dead
she
free
married
whom
she
will
only
the
Lord
Corinthians
But
she
happier
she
abide
she
after
judgment
and
think
that
also
have
the
Spirit
God
Corinthians
Now
concerning
things
sacrificed
idols
know
that
all
have
knowledge
Knowledge
puffeth
but
love
edifieth
Corinthians
any
man
thinketh
that
knoweth
anything
knoweth
not
yet
ought
know
Corinthians
but
any
man
loveth
God
the
same
known
him
Corinthians
Concerning
therefore
the
eating
things
sacrificed
idols
know
that
idol
anything
the
world
and
that
there
God
but
one
Corinthians
For
though
there
that
are
called
gods
whether
heaven
earth
there
are
gods
many
and
lords
many
Corinthians
yet
there
one
God
the
Father
whom
are
all
things
and
unto
him
and
one
Lord
Jesus
Christ
through
whom
are
all
things
and
through
him
Corinthians
Howbeit
there
not
all
men
that
knowledge
but
some
being
used
until
now
the
idol
eat
thing
sacrificed
idol
and
their
conscience
being
weak
defiled
Corinthians
But
food
will
not
commend
God
neither
eat
not
are
the
worse
nor
eat
are
the
better
Corinthians
But
take
heed
lest
any
means
this
liberty
yours
become
stumblingblock
the
weak
Corinthians
For
man
see
thee
who
hast
knowledge
sitting
meat
idol
temple
will
not
his
conscience
weak
emboldened
eat
things
sacrificed
idols
Corinthians
For
through
thy
knowledge
that
weak
perisheth
the
brother
for
whose
sake
Christ
died
Corinthians
And
thus
sinning
against
the
brethren
and
wounding
their
conscience
when
weak
sin
against
Christ
Corinthians
Wherefore
meat
causeth
brother
stumble
will
eat

that
cause
not

Corinthians

defence

Have

Have

the

Cephas

What

Corinthians
speak
these
things
after
the
manner

For

Moses
Thou

that
God

Corinthians
saith

Yea

sowed
unto
you
spiritual

great
matter
shall
reap
your
carnal

Corinthians
others
partake
this
right
over
you
not
yet
more
Nevertheless
did
not
use
this
right
but
bear
all
things
that
may
cause
hindrance
the
gospel
Christ
Corinthians
Know
not
that
they
that
minister
about
sacred
things
eat
the
things
the
temple
and
they
that
wait
upon
the
altar
have
their
portion
with
the
altar
Corinthians
Even
did
the
Lord
ordain
that
they
that
proclaim
the
gospel
should
live
the
gospel
Corinthians
But
have
used
none
these
things
and
write
not
these
things
that
may
done
case
for
were
good
for
rather
die
than
that
any
man
should
make
glorying
void
Corinthians
For
preach
the
gospel
have
nothing
glory
for
necessity
laid
upon
for
woe
unto
preach
not
the
gospel
Corinthians
For
this
mine
own
will
have
reward
but
not
mine
own
will
have
stewardship
intrusted
Corinthians
What
then
reward
That
when
preach
the
gospel
may
make
the
gospel
without
charge
not
use
the
full
right
the
gospel
Corinthians
For
though
was
free
from
all
men
brought
myself
under
bondage
all
that
might
gain
the
more
Corinthians
And
the
Jews
became
Jew
that
might
gain
Jews
them
that
are
under
the
law
under
the
law
not
being
myself
under
the
law
that
might
gain
them
that
are
under
the
law
Corinthians
them
that
are
without
law
without
law
not
being
without
law
God
but
under
law
Christ
that
might
gain
them
that
are
without

Corinthians
the
weak
became
weak
that
might
gain
the
weak
become
all
things
all
men
that
may
all
means
save
some
Corinthians
And
all
things
for
the
gospel
sake
that
may
joint
partaker
thereof
Corinthians
Know
not
that
they
that
run
race
run
all
but
one
receiveth
the
prize
Even
run
that
may
attain
Corinthians
And
every
man
that
striveth
the
games
exerciseth
self
control
all
things
Now
they
receive
corruptible
crown
but
incorruptible
Corinthians
therefore
run
not
uncertainly
fight
not
beating
the
air
Corinthians
but
buffet
body
and
bring
into
bondage
lest
any
means
after
that
have
preached
others
myself
should
rejected
Corinthians
For
would
not
brethren
have
you
ignorant
that
our
fathers
were
all
under
the
cloud
and
all
passed
through
the
sea
Corinthians
and
were
all
baptized
unto
Moses
the
cloud
and
the
sea
Corinthians
and
did
all
eat
the
same
spiritual
food
Corinthians
and
did
all
drink
the
same
spiritual
drink
for
they
drank
spiritual
rock
that
followed
them
and
the
rock
was
Christ
Corinthians
Howbeit
with
most
them
God
was
not
well
pleased
for
they
were
overthrown
the
wilderness
Corinthians
Now
these
things
were
our
examples
the
intent
should
not
lust
after
evil
things
they
also
lusted
Corinthians
Neither
idolaters
were
some
them
written
The
people
sat
down
eat
and
drink
and
rose
play
Corinthians
Neither
let
commit
fornication
some
them
committed
and
fell
one
day
three
and
twenty
thousand
Corinthians
Neither
let
make
trial
the
Lord
some
them
made
trial
and
perished
the
serpents
Corinthians
Neither
murmur
some
them
murmured
and
perished
the
destroyer
Corinthians
Now
these
things
happened
unto
them
way
example
and
they
were
written
for
our
admonition
upon
whom
the
ends
the
ages
are
come
Corinthians
Wherefore
let
him
that
thinketh
standeth
take
heed
lest
fall
Corinthians
There
hath
temptation
taken
you
but
such
man
can
bear
but
God
faithful
who
will
not
suffer
you
tempted
above
that
are
able
but
will
with
the
temptation
make
also
the
way
escape
that
may
able
endure
Corinthians
Wherefore
beloved
flee
from
idolatry
Corinthians
speak
wise
men
judge
what
say
Corinthians
The
cup
blessing
which
bless
not
communion
the
blood
Christ
The
bread
which
break
not
communion
the
body
Christ
Corinthians
seeing
that
who
are
many
are
one
bread
one
body
for
are
all
partake
the
one
bread
Corinthians
Behold
Israel
after
the
flesh
have
not
they
that
eat
the
sacrifices
communion
with
the
altar
Corinthians
What
say
then
that
thing
sacrificed
idols
anything
that
idol
anything
Corinthians
But
say
that
the
things
which
the
Gentiles
sacrifice
they
sacrifice
demons
and
not
God
and
would
not
that
should
have
communion
with
demons
Corinthians
cannot
drink
the
cup
the
Lord
and
the
cup
demons
cannot
partake
the
table
the
Lord
and
the
table
demons
Corinthians
provoke
the
Lord
jealousy
are
stronger
than
Corinthians
All
things
are
lawful
but
not
all
things
are
expedient
All
things
are
lawful
but
not
all
things
edify
Corinthians
Let
man
seek
his
own
but
each
his
neighbor
good
Corinthians
Whatsoever
sold
the
shambles

Corinthians
for

the

Corinthians
one

that

biddeth
you
feast
and
are
disposed
whatsoever
set

Corinthians
But
any

say
unto
you
This
hath
been
offered
sacrifice
eat
not
for

that

and
for

Corinthians
conscience

not
thine

the
other
for
why

another

Corinthians
partake
with
thankfulness
why
evil
spoken
for
that
for
which
give
thanks
Corinthians
Whether
therefore
eat

whatsoever
all
the

Corinthians
Give
occasion
stumbling
either
Jews
Greeks
the
church
God
Corinthians
even
also
please
all

all

not
seeking
mine
own
profit
but
the
profit
the
many
that
they
may
saved
Corinthians
imitators
even
also
Christ
Corinthians
Now
praise
you
that
remember
all
things
and
hold
fast
the
traditions
even
delivered
them
you
Corinthians
But
would
have
you
know
that
the
head
every
man
Christ
and
the
head
the
woman
the
man
and
the
head
Christ
God
Corinthians
Every
man
praying
prophesying
having
his
head
covered
dishonoreth
his
head
Corinthians
But
every
woman
praying
prophesying
with
her
head
unveiled
dishonoreth
her
head
for
one
and
the
same
thing
she
were
shaven
Corinthians
For
woman
not
veiled
let
her
also
shorn
but
shame
woman
shorn
shaven
let
her
veiled
Corinthians
For
man
indeed
ought
not
have
his
head
veiled
forasmuch
the
image
and
glory
God
but
the
woman
the
glory
the
man
Corinthians
For
the
man
not
the
woman
but
the
woman
the
man
Corinthians
for
neither
was
the
man
created
for
the
woman
but
the
woman
for
the
man
Corinthians
for
this
cause
ought
the
woman
have
sign
authority
her
head
because
the
angels
Corinthians
Nevertheless
neither
the
woman
without
the
man
nor
the
man
without
the
woman
the
Lord
Corinthians
For
the
woman
the
man
the
man
also
the
woman
but
all
things
are
God
Corinthians
Judge
yourselves
seemly
that
woman
pray
unto
God
unveiled
Corinthians
Doth
not
even
nature
itself
teach
you
that
man
have
long
hair
dishonor
him
Corinthians
But
woman
have
long
hair
glory
her
for
her
hair
given
her
for
covering
Corinthians
But
any
man
seemeth
contentious
have
such
custom
neither
the
churches
God
Corinthians
But
giving
you
this
charge
praise
you
not
that
come
together
not
for
the
better
but
for
the
worse
Corinthians
For
first
all
when
come
together
the
church
hear
that
divisions
exist
among
you
and
partly
believe
Corinthians
For
there
must
also
factions
among
you
that
they
that
are
approved
may
made
manifest
among
you
Corinthians
When
therefore
assemble
yourselves
together
not
possible
eat
the
Lord
supper
Corinthians
for
your
eating
each
one
taketh
before
other
his
own
supper
and
one
hungry
and
another
drunken
Corinthians
What
have
not
houses
eat
and
drink
despise
the
church
God
and
put
them
shame
that
have
not
What
shall
say
you
shall
praise
you
this
praise
you
not
Corinthians
For
received
the
Lord
that
which
also
delivered
unto
you
that
the
Lord
Jesus
the
night
which
was
betrayed
took
bread
Corinthians
and
when
had
given
thanks
brake
and
said
This
body
which
for
you
this
remembrance
Corinthians
like
manner
also
the
cup
after
supper
saying
This
cup
the
new
covenant
blood
this
often
drink
remembrance
Corinthians
For
often
eat
this
bread
and
drink
the
cup
proclaim
the
Lord
death
till
come
Corinthians
Wherefore
whosoever
shall
eat
the
bread
drink
the
cup
the
Lord
unworthy
manner
shall
guilty
the
body
and
the
blood
the
Lord
Corinthians
But
let
man
prove
himself
and
let
him
eat
the
bread
and
drink
the
cup
Corinthians
For
that
eateth
and
drinketh
eateth
and
drinketh
judgment
unto
himself
discern
not
the
body
Corinthians
For
this
cause
many
among
you
are
weak
and
sickly
and
not
few
sleep
Corinthians
But
discerned
ourselves
should
not
judged
Corinthians
But
when
are
judged
are
chastened
the
Lord
that
may
not
condemned
with
the
world
Corinthians
Wherefore
brethren
when
come
together
eat
wait
one
for
another
Corinthians
any
man
hungry
let
him
eat
home
that
your
coming
together
not
unto
judgment
And
the
rest
will
set
order
whensoever
come
Corinthians
Now
concerning
spiritual
gifts
brethren
would
not
have
you
ignorant
Corinthians
know
that
when
were
Gentiles
were
led
away
unto
those
dumb
idols
howsoever
might
led
Corinthians
Wherefore
make
known
unto
you
that
man
speaking
the
Spirit
God
saith
Jesus
anathema
and
man
can
say
Jesus
Lord
but
the
Holy
Spirit
Corinthians
Now
there
are
diversities
gifts
but
the
same
Spirit
Corinthians
And
there
are
diversities
ministrations
and
the
same
Lord
Corinthians
And
there
are
diversities
workings
but
the
same
God
who
worketh
all
things
all
Corinthians
But
each
one
given
the
manifestation
the
Spirit
profit
withal
Corinthians
For
one
given
through
the
Spirit
the
word
wisdom
and
another
the
word
knowledge
according
the
same
Spirit
Corinthians
another
faith
the
same
Spirit
and
another
gifts
healings
the
one
Spirit

Corinthians
but
all
these
worketh
the
one
and
the
same
Spirit
dividing
each
one
severally
even
will
Corinthians
For
the
body
one
and
hath
many
members
and
all
the
members
the
body
being
many
are
one
body
also
Christ
Corinthians
For
one
Spirit
were
all
baptized
into
one
body
whether
Jews
Greeks
whether
bond
free
and
were
all
made
drink
one
Spirit
Corinthians
For
the
body
not
one
member
but
many
Corinthians
the
foot
shall
say
Because
not
the
hand
not
the
body
not
therefore
not
the
body
Corinthians
And
the
ear
shall
say
Because
not
the
eye
not
the

not
therefore
not
the
body
Corinthians
the
whole
body
were
eye
where
were
the
hearing
the
whole
were
hearing
where
were
the
smelling
Corinthians
But
now
hath
God
set
the
members
each
one
them
the
body
even
pleased
him
Corinthians
And
they
were
all
one
member
where
were
the
body
Corinthians
But
now
they
are
many
members
but
one
body
Corinthians
And
the
eye
cannot
say
the
hand
have
need
thee
again
the
head
the
feet
have
need
you
Corinthians
Nay
much
rather
those
members
the
body
which
seem
more
feeble
are
necessary
Corinthians
and
those
parts
the
body
which
think
less
honorable
upon
these
bestow
more
abundant
honor
and
our
uncomely
parts
have
more
abundant
comeliness
Corinthians
whereas
our
comely
parts
have
need
but
God
tempered
the
body
together
giving
more
abundant
honor
that
part
which
lacked
Corinthians
that
there
should
schism
the
body
but
that
the
members
should
have
the
same
care
one
for
another
Corinthians
And
whether
one
member
suffereth
all
the
members
suffer
with
one
member
honored
all
the
members
rejoice
with
Corinthians
Now
are
the
body
Christ
and
severally
members
thereof
Corinthians
And
God
hath
set
some
the
church
first
apostles
secondly
prophets
thirdly
teachers
then
miracles
then
gifts
healings
helps
governments
divers
kinds
tongues
Corinthians
Are
all
apostles
are
all
prophets
are
all
teachers
are
all
workers
miracles
Corinthians
have
all
gifts
healings
all
speak
with
tongues
all
interpret
Corinthians
But
desire
earnestly
the
greater
gifts
And
moreover
most
excellent
way
show
unto
you
Corinthians
speak
with
the
tongues
men
and
angels
but
have
not
love
become
sounding
brass
clanging
cymbal
Corinthians
And
have
the
gift
prophecy
and
know
all
mysteries
and
all
knowledge
and
have
all
faith
remove
mountains
but
have
not
love
nothing
Corinthians
And
bestow
all
goods
feed
the
poor
and
give
body
burned
but
have
not
love
profiteth
nothing
Corinthians
Love
suffereth
long
and
kind
love
envieth
not
love
vaunteth
not
itself
not
puffed
Corinthians
doth
not
behave
itself
unseemly
seeketh
not
its
own
not
provoked
taketh
not
account
evil
Corinthians
rejoiceth
not
unrighteousness
but
rejoiceth
with
the
truth
Corinthians
beareth
all
things
believeth
all
things
hopeth
all
things
endureth
all
things
Corinthians
Love
never
faileth
but
whether
there
prophecies
they
shall
done
away
whether
there
tongues
they
shall
cease
whether
there
knowledge
shall
done
away
Corinthians
For
know
part
and
prophesy
part
Corinthians
but
when
that
which
perfect
come
that
which
part
shall
done
away
Corinthians
When
was
child
spake
child
felt
child
thought
child
now
that
become
man
have
put
away
childish
things
Corinthians
For
now
see
mirror
darkly
but
then
face
face
now
know
part
but
then
shall
know
fully
even
also
was
fully
known
Corinthians
But
now
abideth
faith
hope
love
these
three
and
the
greatest
these
love
Corinthians
Follow
after
love
yet
desire
earnestly
spiritual
gifts
but
rather
that
may
prophesy
Corinthians
For
that
speaketh
tongue
speaketh
not
unto
men
but
unto
God
for
man
understandeth
but
the
spirit
speaketh
mysteries
Corinthians
But
that
prophesieth
speaketh
unto
men
edification
and
exhortation
and
consolation
Corinthians
that
speaketh
tongue
edifieth
himself
but
that
prophesieth
edifieth
the
church
Corinthians
Now
would
have
you
all
speak
with
tongues
but
rather
that
should
prophesy
and
greater
that
prophesieth
than
that
speaketh
with
tongues
except
interpret
that
the
church
may
receive
edifying
Corinthians
But
now
brethren
come
unto
you
speaking
with
tongues
what
shall
profit
you
unless
speak
you
either
way
revelation
knowledge
prophesying
teaching
Corinthians
Even
things
without
life
giving
voice
whether
pipe
harp
they
give
not
distinction
the
sounds
how
shall
known
what
piped
harped
Corinthians
For
the
trumpet
give
uncertain
voice
who
shall
prepare
himself
for
war
Corinthians
also
unless
utter
the
tongue
speech
easy
understood
how
shall
known
what
spoken
for
will
speaking
into
the
air
Corinthians
There
are
may
many
kinds
voices
the
world
and
kind
without
signification
Corinthians
then
know
not
the
meaning
the
voice
shall
him
that
speaketh
barbarian
and
that
speaketh
will
barbarian
unto
Corinthians
also
since
are
zealous
spiritual
gifts
seek
that
may
abound
unto
the
edifying
the
church
Corinthians
Wherefore
let
him
that
speaketh
tongue
pray
that
may
interpret
Corinthians
For
pray
tongue
spirit
prayeth
but
understanding
unfruitful
Corinthians
What
then
will
pray
with
the
spirit
and
will
pray
with
the
understanding
also
will
sing
with
the
spirit
and
will
sing
with
the
understanding
also
Corinthians
Else
thou
bless
with
the
spirit
how
shall
that
filleth
the
place
the
unlearned
say
the
Amen
thy
giving
thanks
seeing
knoweth
not
what
thou
sayest
Corinthians
For
thou
verily
givest
thanks
well
but
the
other
not
edified
Corinthians
thank
God
speak
with
tongues
more
than
you
all
Corinthians
howbeit
the
church
had
rather
speak
five
words
with
understanding
that
might
instruct
others
also
than
ten
thousand
words
tongue
Corinthians
Brethren
not
children
mind
yet
malice
babes
but
mind
men
Corinthians
the
law
written
men
strange
tongues
and
the
lips
strangers
will
speak
unto
this
people
and
not
even
thus
will
they
hear
saith
the
Lord
Corinthians
Wherefore
tongues
are
for
sign
not
them
that
believe
but
the
unbelieving
but
prophesying
for
sign
not
the
unbelieving
but
them
that
believe
Corinthians
therefore
the
whole
church
assembled
together
and
all
speak
with
tongues
and
there
come
men
unlearned
unbelieving
will
they
not
say
that
are
mad
Corinthians
But
all
prophesy
and
there
come
one
unbelieving
unlearned
reproved
all
judged
all
Corinthians
the
secrets
his
heart
are
made
manifest
and
will
fall
down
his
face
and
worship
God
declaring
that
God
among
you
indeed
Corinthians
What
then
brethren
When
come
together
each
one
hath
psalm
hath
teaching
hath
revelation
hath
tongue
hath
interpretation
Let
all
things
done
unto
edifying
Corinthians
any
man
speaketh
tongue
let
two
the
most
three
and
that
turn
and
let
one
interpret
Corinthians
but
there
interpreter
let
him
keep
silence
the
church
and
let
him
speak
himself
and
God
Corinthians
And
let
the
prophets
speak
two
three
and
let
the
others
discern
Corinthians
But
revelation
made
another
sitting
let
the
first
keep
silence
Corinthians
For
all
can
prophesy
one
one
that
all
may
learn
and
all
may
exhorted
Corinthians
and
the
spirits
the
prophets
are
subject
the
prophets
Corinthians
for
God
not
God
confusion
but
peace
all
the
churches
the
saints
Corinthians
let
the
women
keep
silence
the
churches
for
not
permitted
unto
them
speak
but
let
them
subjection
also
saith
the
law
Corinthians
And
they
would
learn
anything
let
them
ask
their
own
husbands
home
for
shameful
for
woman
speak
the
church
Corinthians
What
was
from
you
that
the
word
God
went
forth
came
unto
you
alone
Corinthians
any
man
thinketh
himself
prophet
spiritual
let
him
take
knowledge
the
things
which
write
unto
you
that
they
are
the
commandment
the
Lord
Corinthians
But
any
man
ignorant
let
him
ignorant
Corinthians
Wherefore
brethren
desire
earnestly
prophesy
and
forbid
not
speak
with
tongues
Corinthians
But
let
all
things
done
decently
and
order
Corinthians
Now
make
known
unto
you
brethren
the
gospel
which
preached
unto
you
which
also
received
wherein
also
stand
Corinthians
which
also
are
saved
hold
fast
the
word
which
preached
unto
you
except
believed
vain
Corinthians
For
delivered
unto
you
first
all
that
which
also
received
that
Christ
died
for
our
sins
according
the
scriptures
Corinthians
and
that
was
buried
and
that
hath
been
raised
the
third
day
according
the
scriptures
Corinthians
and
that
appeared
Cephas
then
the
twelve
Corinthians
then
appeared
above
five
hundred
brethren
once
whom
the
greater
part
remain
until
now
but
some
are
fallen
asleep
Corinthians
then
appeared
James
then
all
the
apostles
Corinthians
and
last
all
the
child
untimely
born
appeared
also
Corinthians
For
the
least
the
apostles
that
not
meet
called
apostle
because
persecuted
the
church
God
Corinthians
But
the
grace
God
what
and
his
grace
which
was
bestowed
upon
was
not
found
vain
but
labored
more
abundantly
than
they
all
yet
not
but
the
grace
God
which
was
with
Corinthians
Whether
then
they
preach
and
believed
Corinthians
Now
Christ
preached
that
hath
been
raised
from
the
dead
how
say
some
among
you
that
there
resurrection
the
dead
Corinthians
But
there
resurrection
the
dead
neither
hath
Christ
been
raised
Corinthians
and
Christ
hath
not
been
raised
then
our
preaching
vain
your
faith
also
vain
Corinthians
Yea
and
are
found
false
witnesses
God
because
witnessed
God
that
raised
Christ
whom
raised
not
that
the
dead
are
not
raised
Corinthians
For
the
dead
are
not
raised
neither
hath
Christ
been
raised
Corinthians
and
Christ
hath
not
been
raised
your
faith
vain
are
yet
your
sins
Corinthians
Then
they
also
that
are
fallen
asleep
Christ
have
perished
Corinthians
have
only
hoped
Christ
this
life
are
all
men
most
pitiable
Corinthians
But
now
hath
Christ
been
raised
from
the
dead
the
firstfruits
them
that
are
asleep
Corinthians
For
since
man
came
death
man
came
also
the
resurrection
the
dead
Corinthians
For
Adam
all
die
also
Christ
shall
all
made
alive
Corinthians
But
each
his
own
order
Christ
the
firstfruits
then
they
that
are
Christ
his
coming
Corinthians
Then
cometh
the
end
when
shall
deliver
the
kingdom
God
even
the
Father
when
shall
have
abolished
all
rule
and
all
authority
and
power
Corinthians
For
must
reign
till
hath
put
all
his
enemies
under
his
feet
Corinthians
The
last
enemy
that
shall
abolished
death
Corinthians
For
put
all
things
subjection
under
his
feet
But
when
saith
All
things
are
put
subjection
evident
that
excepted
who
did
subject
all
things
unto
him
Corinthians
And
when
all
things
have
been
subjected
unto
him
then
shall
the
Son
also
himself
subjected
him
that
did
subject
all
things
unto
him
that
God
may
all
all
Corinthians
Else
what
shall
they
that
are
baptized
for
the
dead
the
dead
are
not
raised
all
why
then
are
they
baptized
for
them
Corinthians
why
also
stand
jeopardy
every
hour
Corinthians
protest
that
glorying
you
brethren
which
have
Christ
Jesus
our
Lord
die
daily
Corinthians
after
the
manner
men
fought
with
beasts
Ephesus
what
doth
profit
the
dead
are
not
raised
let
eat
and
drink
for
morrow
die
Corinthians
not
deceived
Evil
companionships
corrupt
good
morals
Corinthians
Awake
soberness
righteously
and
sin
not
for
some
have
knowledge
God
speak
this
move
you
shame
Corinthians
But
some
one
will
say
How
are
the
dead
raised
and
with
what
manner
body
they
come
Corinthians
Thou
foolish
one
that
which
thou
thyself
sowest
not
quickened
except
die
Corinthians
and
that
which
thou
sowest
thou
sowest
not
the
body
that
shall
but
bare
grain
may
chance
wheat
some
other
kind
Corinthians
but
God
giveth
body
even
pleased
him
and
each
seed
body
its
own
Corinthians
All
flesh
not
the
same
flesh
but
there
one
flesh
men
and
another
flesh
beasts
and
another
flesh
birds
and
another
fishes
Corinthians
There
are
also
celestial
bodies
and
bodies
terrestrial
but
the
glory
the
celestial
one
and
the
glory
the
terrestrial
another
Corinthians
There
one
glory
the
sun
and
another
glory
the
moon
and
another
glory
the
stars
for
one
star
differeth
from
another
star
glory
Corinthians
also
the
resurrection
the
dead
sown
corruption
raised
incorruption
Corinthians
sown
dishonor
raised
glory
sown
weakness
raised

Corinthians
sown
natural

there

there
also

Corinthians
also
written
The
first

Adam
became

The
last
Adam
became

Corinthians
Howbeit
that
not

Corinthians
The

the

Corinthians
And
have

Now
this
say
brethren
that
flesh

cannot
inherit
the

God
neither
doth
corruption
inherit

Corinthians
Behold
tell

the
last

and
the

Corinthians
For
this
corruptible
must
put
incorruption
and
this
mortal
must
put
immortality
Corinthians
But
when
this
corruptible
shall
have
put
incorruption
and
this
mortal
shall
have
put
immortality
then
shall
come
pass
the
saying
that
written
Death

death

The

but

Wherefore

And

But

Corinthians
but
with

For

But

Now
Timothy

without

let

therefore
despise
him
But
set

forward
his

worketh
the
patient
enduring
the
same
sufferings
which
also
suffer
Corinthians
and
our
hope
for
you
stedfast
knowing
that
are
partakers
the
sufferings
also
are
the
comfort
Corinthians
For
would
not
have
you
ignorant
brethren
concerning
our
affliction
which
befell
Asia
that
were
weighed
down
exceedingly
beyond
our
power
insomuch
that
despaired
even
life
Corinthians
yea
ourselves
have
had
the
sentence
death
within
ourselves
that
should
not
trust
ourselves
but
God
who
raiseth
the
dead
Corinthians
who
delivered
out
great
death
and
will
deliver
whom
have
set
our
hope
that
will
also
still
deliver
Corinthians
also
helping
together
our
behalf
your
supplication
that
for
the
gift
bestowed
upon
means
many
thanks
may
given
many
persons
our
behalf
Corinthians
For
our
glorying
this
the
testimony
our
conscience
that
holiness
and
sincerity
God
not
fleshly
wisdom
but
the
grace
God
behaved
ourselves
the
world
and
more
abundantly
you
ward
Corinthians
For
write
other
things
unto
you
than
what
read
even
acknowledge
and
hope
will
acknowledge
unto
the
end
Corinthians
also
did
acknowledge
part
that
are
your
glorying
even
also
are
ours
the
day
our
Lord
Jesus
Corinthians
And
this
confidence
was
minded
come
first
unto
you
that
might
have
second
benefit
Corinthians
and
you
pass
into
Macedonia
and
again
from
Macedonia
come
unto
you
and
you
set
forward
journey
unto
Judæa
Corinthians
When
therefore
was
thus
minded
did
show
fickleness
the
things
that
purpose
purpose
according
the
flesh
that
with
there
should
the
yea
yea
and
the
nay
nay
Corinthians
But
God
faithful
our
word
toward
you
not
yea
and
nay
Corinthians
For
the
Son
God
Jesus
Christ
who
was
preached
among
you
even
and
Silvanus
and
Timothy
was
not
yea
and
nay
but
him
yea
Corinthians
For
how
many
soever
the
promises
God
him
the
yea
wherefore
also
through
him
the
Amen
unto
the
glory
God
through
Corinthians
Now
that
establisheth
with
you
Christ
and
anointed
God
Corinthians
who
also
sealed
and
gave
the
earnest
the
Spirit
our
hearts
Corinthians
But
call
God
for
witness
upon
soul
that
spare
you
forbare
come
unto
Corinth
Corinthians
Not
that
have
lordship
over
your
faith
but
are
helpers
your
joy
for
faith
stand
fast
Corinthians
But
determined
this
for
myself
that
would
not
come
again
you
with
sorrow
Corinthians
For
make
you
sorry
who
then
that
maketh
glad
but
that
made
sorry
Corinthians
And
wrote
this
very
thing
lest
when
came
should
have
sorrow
from
them
whom
ought
rejoice
having
confidence
you
all
that
joy
the
joy
you
all
Corinthians
For
out
much
affliction
and
anguish
heart
wrote
unto
you
with
many
tears
not
that
should
made
sorry
but
that
might
know
the
love
which
have
more
abundantly
unto
you
Corinthians
But
any
hath
caused
sorrow
hath
caused
sorrow
not
but
part
that
press
not
too
heavily
you
all
Corinthians
Sufficient
such
one
this
punishment
which
was
inflicted
the
many
Corinthians
that
contrariwise
should
rather
forgive
him
and
comfort
him
lest
any
means
such
one
should
swallowed
with
his
overmuch
sorrow
Corinthians
Wherefore
beseech
you
confirm
your
love
toward
him
Corinthians
For
this
end
also
did
write
that
might
know
the
proof
you
whether
are
obedient
all
things
Corinthians
But
whom
forgive
anything
forgive
also
for
what
also
have
forgiven
have
forgiven
anything
for
your
sakes
have
forgiven
the
presence
Christ
Corinthians
that
advantage
may
gained
over
Satan
for
are
not
ignorant
his
devices
Corinthians
Now
when
came
Troas
for
the
gospel
Christ
and
when
door
was
opened
unto
the
Lord
Corinthians
had
relief
for
spirit
because
found
not
Titus
brother
but
taking
leave
them
went
forth
into
Macedonia
Corinthians
But
thanks
unto
God
who
always
leadeth
triumph
Christ
and
maketh
manifest
through
the
savor
his
knowledge
every
place
Corinthians
For
are
sweet
savor
Christ
unto
God
them
that
are
saved
and
them
that
perish
Corinthians
the
one
savor
from
death
unto
death
the
other
savor
from
life
unto
life
And
who
sufficient
for
these
things
Corinthians
For
are
not
the
many
corrupting
the
word
God
but
sincerity
but
God
the
sight
God
speak
Christ
Corinthians
Are
beginning
again
commend
ourselves
need
some
epistles
commendation
you
from
you
Corinthians
are
our
epistle
written
our
hearts
known
and
read
all
men
Corinthians
being
made
manifest
that
are
epistle
Christ
ministered
written
not
with
ink
but
with
the
Spirit
the
living
God
not
tables
stone
but
tables
that
are
hearts
flesh
Corinthians
And
such
confidence
have
through
Christ
God
ward
Corinthians
not
that
are
sufficient
ourselves
account
anything
from
ourselves
but
our
sufficiency
from
God
Corinthians
who
also
made
sufficient
ministers
new
covenant
not
the
letter
but
the
spirit
for
the
letter
killeth
but
the
spirit
giveth
life
Corinthians
But
the
ministration
death
written
and
engraven
stones
came
with
glory
that
the
children
Israel
could
not
look
stedfastly
upon
the
face
Moses
for
the
glory
his
face
which
glory
was
passing
away
Corinthians
how
shall
not
rather
the
ministration
the
spirit
with
glory
Corinthians
For
the
ministration
condemnation
hath
glory
much
rather
doth
the
ministration
righteousness
exceed
glory
Corinthians
For
verily
that
which
hath
been
made
glorious
hath
not
been
made
glorious
this
respect
reason
the
glory
that
surpasseth
Corinthians
For
that
which
passeth
away
was
with
glory
much
more
that
which
remaineth
glory
Corinthians
Having
therefore
such
hope
use
great
boldness
speech
Corinthians
and
are
not
Moses
who
put
veil
upon
his
face
that
the
children
Israel
should
not
look
stedfastly
the
end
that
which
was
passing
away
Corinthians
but
their
minds
were
hardened
for
until
this
very
day
the
reading
the
old
covenant
the
same
veil
remaineth
not
being
revealed
them
that
done
away
Christ
Corinthians
But
unto
this
day
whensoever
Moses
read
veil
lieth
upon
their
heart
Corinthians
But
whensoever
shall
turn
the
Lord
the
veil
taken
away
Corinthians
Now
the
Lord
the
Spirit
and
where
the
Spirit
the
Lord
there
liberty
Corinthians
But
all
with
unveiled
face
beholding
mirror
the
glory
the
Lord
are
transformed
into
the
same
image
from
glory
glory
even
from
the
Lord
the
Spirit
Corinthians
Therefore
seeing
have
this
ministry
even
obtained
mercy
faint
not
Corinthians
but
have
renounced
the
hidden
things
shame
not
walking
craftiness
nor
handling
the
word
God
deceitfully
but
the
manifestation
the
truth
commending
ourselves
every
man
conscience
the
sight
God
Corinthians
And
even
our
gospel
veiled
veiled
them
that
perish
Corinthians
whom
the
god
this
world
hath
blinded
the
minds
the
unbelieving
that
the
light
the
gospel
the
glory
Christ
who
the
image
God
should
not
dawn
upon
them
Corinthians
For
preach
not
ourselves
but
Christ
Jesus
Lord
and
ourselves
your
servants
for
Jesus
sake
Corinthians
Seeing
God
that
said
Light
shall
shine
out
darkness
who
shined
our
hearts
give
the
light
the
knowledge
the
glory
God
the
face
Jesus
Christ
Corinthians
But
have
this
treasure
earthen
vessels
that
the
exceeding
greatness
the
power
may
God
and
not
from
ourselves
Corinthians
are
pressed
every
side
yet
not
straitened
perplexed
yet
not
unto
despair
Corinthians
pursued
yet
not
forsaken
smitten
down
yet
not
destroyed
Corinthians
always
bearing
about
the
body
the
dying
Jesus
that
the
life
also
Jesus
may
manifested
our
body
Corinthians
For
who
live
are
always
delivered
unto
death
for
Jesus
sake
that
the
life
also
Jesus
may
manifested
our
mortal
flesh
Corinthians
then
death
worketh
but
life
you
Corinthians
But
having
the
same
spirit
faith
according
that
which
written
believed
and
therefore
did
speak
also
believe
and
therefore
also
speak
Corinthians
knowing
that
that
raised
the
Lord
Jesus
shall
raise
also
with
Jesus
and
shall
present
with
you
Corinthians
For
all
things
are
for
your
sakes
that
the
grace
being
multiplied
through
the
many
may
cause
the
thanksgiving
abound
unto
the
glory
God
Corinthians
Wherefore
faint
not
but
though
our
outward
man
decaying
yet
our
inward
man
renewed
day
day
Corinthians
For
our
light
affliction
which
for
the
moment
worketh
for
more
and
more
exceedingly
eternal
weight
glory
Corinthians
while
look
not
the
things
which
are
seen
but
the
things
which
are
not
seen
for
the
things
which
are
seen
are
temporal
but
the
things
which
are
not
seen
are
eternal
Corinthians
For
know
that
the
earthly
house
our
tabernacle
dissolved
have
building
from
God
house
not
made
with
hands
eternal
the
heavens
Corinthians
For
verily
this
groan
longing
clothed
upon
with
our
habitation
which
from
heaven
Corinthians
that
being
clothed
shall
not
found
naked
Corinthians
For
indeed
that
are
this
tabernacle
groan
being
burdened
not
for
that
would
unclothed
but
that
would
clothed
upon
that
what
mortal
may
swallowed
life
Corinthians
Now
that
wrought
for
this
very
thing
God
who
gave
unto
the
earnest
the
Spirit
Corinthians
Being
therefore
always
good
courage
and
knowing
that
whilst
are
home
the
body
are
absent
from
the
Lord
Corinthians
for
walk
faith
not
sight
Corinthians
are
good
courage
say
and
are
willing
rather
absent
from
the
body
and
home
with
the
Lord
Corinthians
Wherefore
also
make
our
aim
whether
home
absent
well
pleasing
unto
him
Corinthians
For
must
all
made
manifest
before
the
judgment
seat
Christ
that
each
one
may
receive
the
things
done
the
body
according
what
hath
done
whether
good
bad
Corinthians
Knowing
therefore
the
fear
the
Lord
persuade
men
but
are
made
manifest
unto
God
and
hope
that
are
made
manifest
also
your
consciences
Corinthians
are
not
again
commending
ourselves
unto
you
but
speak
giving
you
occasion
glorying
our
behalf
that
may
have
wherewith
answer
them
that
glory
appearance
and
not
heart
Corinthians
For
whether
are
beside
ourselves
unto
God
whether
are
sober
mind
unto
you
Corinthians
For
the
love
Christ
constraineth
because
thus
judge
that
one
died
for
all
therefore
all
died
Corinthians
and
died
for
all
that
they
that
live
should
longer
live
unto
themselves
but
unto
him
who
for
their
sakes
died
and
rose
again
Corinthians
Wherefore
henceforth
know
man
after
the
flesh
even
though
have
known
Christ
after
the
flesh
yet
now
know
him
more
Corinthians
Wherefore
any
man
Christ
new
creature
the
old
things
are
passed
away
behold
they
are
become
new
Corinthians
But
all
things
are
God
who
reconciled
himself
through
Christ
and
gave
unto
the
ministry
reconciliation
Corinthians
wit
that
God
was
Christ
reconciling
the
world
unto
himself
not
reckoning
unto
them
their
trespasses
and
having
committed
unto
the
word
reconciliation
Corinthians
are
ambassadors
therefore
behalf
Christ
though
God
were
entreating
beseech
you
behalf
Christ
reconciled
God
Corinthians
Him
who
knew
sin
made
sin
our
behalf
that
might
become
the
righteousness
God
him
Corinthians
And
working
together
with
him
entreat
also
that
receive
not
the
grace
God
vain
Corinthians
for
saith
acceptable
time
hearkened
unto
thee
And
day
salvation
did
succor
thee
behold
now
the
acceptable
time
behold
now
the
day

Corinthians
giving
occasion
stumbling
anything
that
our
ministration
not
blamed
Corinthians
but
everything

and
behold

chastened
and
not

Corinthians
sorrowful
yet
always
rejoicing
poor
yet
making
many
rich
having
nothing
and
yet
possessing
all
things
Corinthians
Our
mouth
open
unto
you
Corinthians
our
heart
enlarged
Corinthians
are
not
straitened
but
are
straitened
your
own
affections
Corinthians
Now
for
recompense
like
kind
speak
unto
children
also
enlarged
Corinthians
not
unequally
yoked
with
unbelievers
for
what
fellowship
have
righteousness
and
iniquity
what
communion
hath
light
with
darkness
Corinthians
And
what
concord
hath
Christ
with
Belial
what
portion
hath
believer
with
unbeliever
Corinthians
And
what
agreement
hath
temple
God
with

for
are
temple
the
living
God
even
God
said
will
dwell
them
and
walk

and
will
their
God
and
they
shall

Corinthians
Wherefore
Come
out
from
among
them
and
separate
saith
the
Lord
And
touch
unclean

And
will
receive
you
Corinthians
And
will

Father
And
shall

saith
the
Lord
Almighty
Corinthians
Having
therefore
these
promises
beloved
let
cleanse
ourselves
from
all
defilement
flesh
and
spirit
perfecting
holiness
the
fear

Corinthians
Open
your
hearts
wronged

man
Corinthians
say
not
condemn
you
for
have
said
before
that
are
our

die
together
and
live
together
Corinthians
Great
boldness
speech
toward
you
great
glorying
your
behalf
filled
with
comfort
overflow
with
joy
all
our
affliction
Corinthians
For
even
when
were
come
into
Macedonia
our
flesh
had
relief
but
were
afflicted
every
side
without
were
fightings
within
were
fears
Corinthians
Nevertheless
that
comforteth
the
lowly
even
God
comforted
the
coming
Titus
Corinthians
and
not
his
coming
only
but
also
the
comfort
wherewith
was
comforted
you
while
told
your
longing
your
mourning
your
zeal
for
that
rejoiced
yet
more
Corinthians
For
though
made
you
sorry
with
epistle
not
regret
though
did
regret
for
see
that
that
epistle
made
you
sorry
though
but
for
season
Corinthians
now
rejoice
not
that
were
made
sorry
but
that
were
made
sorry
unto
repentance
for
were
made
sorry
after
godly
sort
that
might
suffer
loss
nothing
Corinthians
For
godly
sorrow
worketh
repentance
unto
salvation
repentance
which
bringeth
regret
but
the
sorrow
the
world
worketh
death
Corinthians
For
behold
this
selfsame
thing
that
were
made
sorry
after
godly
sort
what
earnest
care
wrought
you
yea
what
clearing
yourselves
yea
what
indignation
yea
what
fear
yea
what
longing
yea
what
zeal
yea
what
avenging
everything
approved
yourselves
pure
the
matter
Corinthians
although
wrote
unto
you
wrote
not
for
his
cause
that
did
the
wrong
nor
for
his
cause
that
suffered
the
wrong
but
that
your
earnest
care
for
might
made
manifest
unto
you
the
sight
God
Corinthians
Therefore
have
been
comforted
and
our
comfort
joyed
the
more
exceedingly
for
the
joy
Titus
because
his
spirit
hath
been
refreshed
you
all
Corinthians
For
anything
have
gloried
him
your
behalf
was
not
put
shame
but
spake
all
things
you
truth
our
glorying
also
which
made
before
Titus
was
found
truth
Corinthians
And
his
affection
more
abundantly
toward
you
while
remembereth
the
obedience
you
all
how
with
fear
and
trembling
received
him
Corinthians
rejoice
that
everything
good
courage
concerning
you
Corinthians
Moreover
brethren
make
known
you
the
grace
God
which
hath
been
given
the
churches
Macedonia
Corinthians
how
that
much
proof
affliction
the
abundance
their
joy
and
their
deep
poverty
abounded
unto
the
riches
their
liberality
Corinthians
For
according
their
power
bear
witness
yea
and
beyond
their
power
they
gave
their
own
accord
Corinthians
beseeching
with
much
entreaty
regard
this
grace
and
the
fellowship
the
ministering
the
saints
Corinthians
and
this
not
had
hoped
but
first
they
gave
their
own
selves
the
Lord
and
through
the
will
God
Corinthians
Insomuch
that
exhorted
Titus
that
had
made
beginning
before
would
also
complete
you
this
grace
also
Corinthians
But
abound
everything
faith
and
utterance
and
knowledge
and
all
earnestness
and
your
love
see
that
abound
this
grace
also
Corinthians
speak
not
way
commandment
but
proving
through
the
earnestness
others
the
sincerity
also
your
love
Corinthians
For
know
the
grace
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
that
though
was
rich
yet
for
your
sakes
became
poor
that
through
his
poverty
might
become
rich
Corinthians
And
herein
give
judgment
for
this
expedient
for
you
who
were
the
first
make
beginning
year
ago
not
only
but
also
will
Corinthians
But
now
complete
the
doing
also
that
there
was
the
readiness
will
there
may
the
completion
also
out
your
ability
Corinthians
For
the
readiness
there
acceptable
according
man
hath
not
according
hath
not
Corinthians
For
say
not
this
that
others
may
eased
and
distressed
Corinthians
but
equality
your
abundance
being
supply
this
present
time
for
their
want
that
their
abundance
also
may
become
supply
for
your
want
that
there
may
equality
Corinthians
written
that
gathered
much
had
nothing
over
and
that
gathered
little
had
lack
Corinthians
But
thanks
God
who
putteth
the
same
earnest
care
for
you
into
the
heart
Titus
Corinthians
For
accepted
indeed
our
exhortation
but
being
himself
very
earnest
went
forth
unto
you
his
own
accord
Corinthians
And
have
sent
together
with
him
the
brother
whose
praise
the
gospel

not

Lord
but
also
the

Corinthians
And
have
sent
with
them
our
brother
whom
have
many
times
proved
earnest
many
things
but
now
much
more
earnest
reason
the
great
confidence

Whether

Corinthians
Show
therefore
unto
them
the

and
our

Corinthians
For

Macedonia
that
Achaia
hath
been
prepared
for
year
past
and
your
zeal
hath
stirred
very
many
them
Corinthians
But
have
sent
the
brethren
that
our
glorying
your
behalf
may
not
made
void
this
respect
that
even
said
may

Corinthians
lest

find
you
unprepared
that

not

this
confidence
Corinthians
thought
necessary
therefore
entreat
the
brethren
that
they
would
before
unto
you
and
make
beforehand
your
aforepromised
bounty
that
the

Corinthians
But
this
say
that

sparingly
and
that

bountifully
shall
reap
also
bountifully
Corinthians
Let
each

And
God

His

Corinthians
And
that
supplieth

food
shall
supply
and
multiply
your
seed
for
sowing
and
increase
the
fruits
your
righteousness
Corinthians
being
enriched
everything
unto
all
liberality
which
worketh
through
thanksgiving
God
Corinthians
For
the
ministration
this
service
not
only
filleth
the
measure
the
wants
the
saints
but
aboundeth
also
through
many
thanksgivings
unto
God
Corinthians
seeing
that
through
the
proving
you
this
ministration
they
glorify
God
for
the
obedience
your
confession
unto
the
gospel
Christ
and
for
the
liberality
your
contribution
unto
them
and
unto
all
Corinthians
while
they
themselves

with
supplication
your

long
after
you
reason
the
exceeding
grace
God
you
Corinthians
Thanks
God
for
his
unspeakable
gift
Corinthians
Now
Paul
myself
entreat
you
the
meekness
and
gentleness
Christ
who
your
presence
lowly
among
you
but
being
absent
good
courage
toward
you
Corinthians
yea
beseech
you
that
may
not
when
present
show
courage
with
the
confidence
wherewith
count
bold
against
some
who
count
walked
according
the
flesh
Corinthians
For
though
walk
the
flesh
not
war
according
the
flesh
Corinthians
for
the
weapons
our
warfare
are
not
the
flesh
but
mighty
before
God
the
casting
down
strongholds
Corinthians
casting
down
imaginations
and
every
high
thing
that
exalted
against
the
knowledge
God
and
bringing
every
thought
into
captivity
the
obedience
Christ
Corinthians
and
being
readiness
avenge
all
disobedience
when
your
obedience
shall
made
full
Corinthians
look
the
things
that
are
before
your
face
any
man
trusteth
himself
that
Christ
let
him
consider
this
again
with
himself
that
even
Christ
also
are
Corinthians
For
though
should
glory
somewhat
abundantly
concerning
our
authority
which
the
Lord
gave
for
building
you
and
not
for
casting
you
down
shall
not
put
shame
Corinthians
that
may
not
seem
would
terrify
you
letters
Corinthians
For
His
letters
they
say
are
weighty
and
strong
but
his
bodily
presence
weak
and
his
speech
account
Corinthians
Let
such
one
reckon
this
that
what
are
word
letters
when
are
absent
such
are
also
deed
when
are
present
Corinthians
For
are
not
bold
number
compare
ourselves
with
certain
them
that
commend
themselves
but
they
themselves
measuring
themselves
themselves
and
comparing
themselves
with
themselves
are
without
understanding
Corinthians
But
will
not
glory
beyond
our
measure
but
according
the
measure
the
province
which
God
apportioned
measure
reach
even
unto
you
Corinthians
For
stretch
not
ourselves
overmuch
though
reached
not
unto
you
for
came
even
far
unto
you
the
gospel
Christ
Corinthians
not
glorying
beyond
our
measure
that
other
men
labors
but
having
hope
that
your
faith
groweth
shall
magnified
you
according
our
province
unto
further
abundance
Corinthians
preach
the
gospel
even
unto
the
parts
beyond
you
and
not
glory
another
province
regard
things
ready
our
hand
Corinthians
But
that
glorieth
let
him
glory
the
Lord
Corinthians
For
not
that
commendeth
himself
approved
but
whom
the
Lord
commendeth
Corinthians
Would
that
could
bear
with
little
foolishness
but
indeed
bear
with
Corinthians
For
jealous
over
you
with
godly
jealousy
for
espoused
you
one
husband
that
might
present
you
pure
virgin
Christ
Corinthians
But
fear
lest
any
means
the
serpent
beguiled
Eve
his
craftiness
your
minds
should
corrupted
from
the
simplicity
and
the
purity
that
toward
Christ
Corinthians
For
that
cometh
preacheth
another
Jesus
whom
did
not
preach
receive
different
spirit
which
did
not
receive
different
gospel
which
did
not
accept
well
bear
with
him
Corinthians
For
reckon
that
not
whit
behind
the
very
chiefest
apostles
Corinthians
But
though
rude
speech
yet
not
knowledge
nay
every
way
have
made
this
manifest
unto
you
all
things
Corinthians
did
commit
sin
abasing
myself
that
might
exalted
because
preached
you
the
gospel
God
for
nought
Corinthians
robbed
other
churches
taking
wages
them
that
might
minister
unto
you
Corinthians
and
when
was
present
with
you
and
was
want
was
not
burden
any
man
for
the
brethren
when
they
came
from
Macedonia
supplied
the
measure
want
and
everything
kept
myself
from
being
burdensome
unto
you
and
will
keep
myself
Corinthians
the
truth
Christ
man
shall
stop
this
glorying
the
regions
Achaia
Corinthians
Wherefore
because
love
you
not
God
knoweth
Corinthians
But
what
that
will
that
may
cut
off
occasion
from
them
that
desire
occasion
that
wherein
they
glory
they
may
found
even
Corinthians
For
such
men
are
false
apostles
deceitful
workers
fashioning
themselves
into
apostles
Christ
Corinthians
And
marvel
for
even
Satan
fashioneth
himself
into
angel
light
Corinthians
great
thing
therefore
his
ministers
also
fashion
themselves
ministers
righteousness
whose
end
shall
according
their
works
Corinthians
say
again
Let
man
think
foolish
but
yet
foolish
receive
that
also
may
glory
little
Corinthians
That
which
speak
speak
not
after
the
Lord
but
foolishness
this
confidence
glorying
Corinthians
Seeing
that
many
glory
after
the
flesh
will
glory
also
Corinthians
For
bear
with
the
foolish
gladly
being
wise
yourselves
Corinthians
For
bear
with
man
bringeth
you
into

devoureth
you
taketh

captive
exalteth

Yet
whereinsoever

Are

Besides

Who

And

how

Corinthians
For
should

for

speak

truth
but
forbear
lest
any

should
account
above
that
which

And
reason
the
exceeding
greatness
the
revelations
that

not
exalted
overmuch
there
was
given
thorn
the
flesh
messenger
Satan
buffet
that
should
not
exalted
overmuch
Corinthians
Concerning
this
thing
besought
the
Lord
thrice
that
might
depart
from
Corinthians
And
hath
said
unto
grace
sufficient
for
thee
for
power
made
perfect
weakness
Most
gladly
therefore
will
rather
glory
weaknesses
that
the
power
Christ
may
rest
upon
Corinthians
Wherefore
take
pleasure
weaknesses
injuries
necessities
persecutions
distresses
for
Christ
sake
for
when
weak
then
strong
Corinthians
become
foolish
compelled
for
ought
have
been
commended
you
for
nothing
was
behind
the
very
chiefest
apostles
though
nothing
Corinthians
Truly
the
signs
apostle
were
wrought
among
you
all
patience
signs
and
wonders
and
mighty
works
Corinthians
For
what
there
wherein
were
made
inferior
the
rest
the
churches
except
that
myself
was
not
burden
you
forgive
this
wrong
Corinthians
Behold
this
the
third
time
ready
come
you
and
will
not
burden
you
for
seek
not
yours
but
you
for
the
children
ought
not
lay
for
the
parents
but
the
parents
for
the
children
Corinthians
And
will
most
gladly
spend
and
spent
for
your
souls
love
you
more
abundantly
loved
the
less
Corinthians
But
did
not
myself
burden
you
but
being
crafty
caught
you
with
guile
Corinthians
Did
take
advantage
you
any
one
them
whom
have
sent
unto
you
Corinthians
exhorted
Titus
and
sent
the
brother
with
him
Did
Titus
take
any
advantage
you
walked
not
the
same
spirit
walked
not
the
same
steps
Corinthians
think
all
this
time
that
are
excusing
ourselves
unto
you
the
sight
God
speak
Christ
But
all
things
beloved
are
for
your
edifying
Corinthians
For
fear
lest
any
means
when
come
should
find
you
not
such
would
and
should
myself
found
you
such
would
not
lest
any
means
there
should
strife
jealousy
wraths
factions
backbitings
whisperings
swellings
tumults
Corinthians
lest
again
when
come
God
should
humble
before
you
and
should
mourn
for
many
them
that
have
sinned
heretofore
and
repented
not
the
uncleanness
and
fornication
and
lasciviousness
which
they
committed
Corinthians
This
the
third
time
coming
you
the
mouth
two
witnesses
three
shall
every
word
established
Corinthians
have
said
beforehand
and
say
beforehand
when
was
present
the
second
time
now
being
absent
them
that
have
sinned
heretofore
and
all
the
rest
that
come
again
will
not
spare
Corinthians
seeing
that
seek
proof
Christ
that
speaketh
who
you
ward
not
weak
but
powerful
you
Corinthians
for
was
crucified
through
weakness
yet
liveth
through
the
power
God
For
also
are
weak
him
but
shall
live
with
him
through
the
power
God
toward
you
Corinthians
Try
your
own
selves
whether
are
the
faith
prove
your
own
selves
know
not
your
own
selves
that
Jesus
Christ
you
unless
indeed
reprobate
Corinthians
But
hope
that
shall
know
that
are
not
reprobate
Corinthians
Now
pray
God
that
evil
not
that
may
appear
approved
but
that
may
that
which
honorable
though
reprobate
Corinthians
For
can
nothing
against
the
truth
but
for
the
truth
Corinthians
For
rejoice
when
are
weak
and
are
strong
this
also
pray
for
even
your
perfecting
Corinthians
For
this
cause
write
these
things
while
absent
that
may
not
when
present
deal
sharply
according
the
authority
which
the
Lord
gave
for
building
and
not
for
casting
down
Corinthians
Finally
brethren
farewell
perfected
comforted
the
same
mind
live
peace
and
the
God
love
and
peace
shall
with
you
Corinthians
Salute
one
another
with
holy
kiss
Corinthians
All
the
saints
salute
you
Corinthians
The
grace
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
the
love
God
and
the
communion
the
Holy
Spirit
with
you
all
Galatians
Paul
apostle
not
from
men
neither
through
man
but
through
Jesus
Christ
and
God
the
Father
who
raised
him
from
the
dead
Galatians
and
all
the
brethren
that
are
with
unto
the
churches
Galatia
Galatians
Grace
you
and
peace
from
God
the
Father
and
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
Galatians
who
gave
himself
for
our
sins
that
might
deliver
out
this
present
evil
world
according
the
will
our
God
and
Father
Galatians
whom
the
glory
for
ever
and
ever
Amen
Galatians
marvel
that
are
quickly
removing
from
him
that
called
you
the
grace
Christ
unto
different
gospel
Galatians
which
not
another
gospel
only
there
are
some
that
trouble
you
and
would
pervert
the
gospel
Christ
Galatians
But
though
angel
from
heaven
should
preach
unto
you
any
gospel
other
than
that
which
preached
unto
you
let
him
anathema
Galatians
have
said
before
say
now
again
any
man
preacheth
unto
you
any
gospel
other
than
that
which
received
let
him
anathema
Galatians
For
now
seeking
the
favor
men
God
striving
please
men
were
still
pleasing
men
should
not
servant
Christ
Galatians
For
make
known
you
brethren
touching
the
gospel
which
was
preached
that
not
after
man
Galatians
For
neither
did
receive
from
man
nor
was
taught
but
came
through
revelation
Jesus
Christ
Galatians
For
have
heard
manner
life
time
past
the
Jews
religion
how
that
beyond
measure
persecuted
the
church
God
and
made
havoc
Galatians
and
advanced
the
Jews
religion
beyond
many
mine
own
age
among
countrymen
being
more
exceedingly
zealous
for
the
traditions
fathers
Galatians
But
when
was
the
good
pleasure
God
who
separated
even
from
mother
womb
and
called
through
his
grace
Galatians
reveal
his
Son
that
might
preach
him
among
the
Gentiles
straightway
conferred
not
with
flesh
and
blood
Galatians
neither
went
Jerusalem
them
that
were
apostles
before
but
went
away
into
Arabia
and
again
returned
unto
Damascus
Galatians
Then
after
three
years
went
Jerusalem
visit
Cephas
and
tarried
with
him
fifteen
days
Galatians
But
other
the
apostles
saw
none
save
James
the
Lord
brother
Galatians
Now
touching
the
things
which
write
unto
you
behold
before
God
lie
not
Galatians
Then
came
into
the
regions
Syria
and
Cilicia
Galatians
And
was
still
unknown
face
unto
the
churches
Judæa
which
were
Christ
Galatians
but
they
only
heard
say
that
once
persecuted
now
preacheth
the
faith
which
once
made
havoc
Galatians
and
they
glorified
God
Galatians
Then
after
the
space
fourteen
years
went
again
Jerusalem
with
Barnabas
taking
Titus
also
with
Galatians
And
went
revelation
and
laid
before
them
the
gospel
which
preach
among
the
Gentiles
but
privately
before
them
who
were
repute
lest
any
means
should
running
had
run
vain
Galatians
But
not
even
Titus
who
was
with
being
Greek
was
compelled
circumcised
Galatians
and
that
because
the
false
brethren
privily
brought
who
came
privily
spy
out
our
liberty
which
have
Christ
Jesus
that
they
might
bring
into
bondage
Galatians
whom
gave
place
the
way
subjection
not
for
hour
that
the
truth
the
gospel
might
continue
with
you
Galatians
But
from
those
who
were
reputed
somewhat
whatsoever
they
were
maketh
matter
God
accepteth
not
man
person
they
say
who
were
repute
imparted
nothing
Galatians
but
contrariwise
when
they
saw
that
had
been
intrusted
with
the
gospel
the
uncircumcision
even
Peter
with
the
gospel
the
circumcision
Galatians
for
that
wrought
for
Peter
unto
the
apostleship
the
circumcision
wrought
for
also
unto
the
Gentiles
Galatians
and
when
they
perceived
the
grace
that
was
given
unto
James
and
Cephas
and
John
they
who
were
reputed
pillars
gave
and
Barnabas
the
right
hands
fellowship
that
should
unto
the
Gentiles
and
they
unto
the
circumcision
Galatians
only
they
would
that
should
remember
the
poor
which
very
thing
was
also
zealous
Galatians
But
when
Cephas
came
Antioch
resisted
him
the
face
because
stood
condemned
Galatians
For
before
that
certain
came
from
James
ate
with
the
Gentiles
but
when
they
came
drew
back
and
separated
himself
fearing
them
that
were
the
circumcision
Galatians
And
the
rest
the
Jews
dissembled
likewise
with
him
insomuch
that
even
Barnabas
was
carried
away
with
their
dissimulation
Galatians
But
when
saw
that
they
walked
not
uprightly
according
the
truth
the
gospel
said
unto
Cephas
before
them
all
thou
being
Jew
livest
the
Gentiles
and
not
the
Jews
how
compellest
thou
the
Gentiles
live
the
Jews
Galatians
being
Jews
nature
and
not
sinners
the
Gentiles
Galatians
yet
knowing
that
man
not
justified
the
works
the
law
but
through
faith
Jesus
Christ
even
believed
Christ
Jesus
that
might
justified
faith
Christ
and
not
the
works
the
law
because
the
works
the
law
shall
flesh
justified
Galatians
But
while
sought
justified
Christ
ourselves
also
were
found
sinners
Christ
minister
sin
God
forbid
Galatians
For
build
again
those
things
which
destroyed
prove
myself
transgressor
Galatians
For
through
the
law
died
unto
the
law
that
might
live
unto
God
Galatians
have
been
crucified
with
Christ
and
longer
that
live
but
Christ
liveth
and
that
life
which
now
live
the
flesh
live
faith
the
faith
which
the
Son
God
who
loved
and
gave
himself
for
Galatians
not
make
void
the
grace
God
for
righteousness
through
the
law
then
Christ
died
for
nought
Galatians
foolish
Galatians
who
did
bewitch
you
before
whose
eyes
Jesus
Christ
was
openly
set
forth
crucified
Galatians
This
only
would
learn
from
you
Received
the
Spirit
the
works
the
law
the
hearing
faith
Galatians
Are
foolish
having
begun
the
Spirit
are
now
perfected
the
flesh
Galatians
Did
suffer
many
things
vain
indeed
vain
Galatians
therefore
that
supplieth
you
the
Spirit
and
worketh
miracles
among
you
doeth
the
works
the
law
the
hearing
faith
Galatians
Even
Abraham
believed
God
and
was
reckoned
unto
him
for
righteousness
Galatians
Know
therefore
that
they
that
are
faith
the
same
are
sons
Abraham
Galatians
And
the
scripture
foreseeing
that
God
would
justify
the
Gentiles
faith
preached
the
gospel
beforehand
unto
Abraham
saying
thee
shall
all
the
nations
blessed
Galatians
then
they
that
are
faith
are
blessed
with
the
faithful
Abraham
Galatians
For
many
are
the
works
the
law
are
under
curse
for
written
Cursed
every
one
who
continueth
not
all
things
that
are
written
the
book
the
law
them
Galatians
Now
that
man
justified
the
law
before
God
evident
for
The
righteous
shall
live
faith
Galatians
and
the
law
not
faith
but
that
doeth
them
shall
live
them
Galatians
Christ
redeemed
from
the
curse
the
law
having
become
curse
for
for
written
Cursed
every
one
that
hangeth
tree
Galatians
that
upon
the
Gentiles
might
come
the
blessing
Abraham
Christ
Jesus
that
might
receive
the
promise
the
Spirit
through
faith
Galatians
Brethren
speak
after
the
manner
men
Though
but
man
covenant
yet
when
hath
been
confirmed
one
maketh
void
addeth
thereto
Galatians
Now
Abraham
were
the
promises
spoken
and
his
seed
saith
not
And
seeds
many
but
one
And
thy
seed
which
Christ
Galatians
Now
this
say
covenant
confirmed
beforehand
God
the
law
which
came
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
after
doth
not
disannul
make
the
promise
none
effect
Galatians
For
the
inheritance
the
law
more
promise
but
God
hath
granted
Abraham
promise
Galatians
What
then
the
law
was
added
because
transgressions
till
the
seed
should
come
whom
the
promise
hath
been
made
and
was
ordained
through
angels
the
hand
mediator
Galatians
Now
mediator
not
mediator
one
but
God
one
Galatians
the
law
then
against
the
promises
God
God
forbid
for
there
had
been
law
given
which
could
make
alive
verily
righteousness
would
have
been
the
law
Galatians
But
the
scripture
shut
all
things
under
sin
that
the
promise
faith
Jesus
Christ
might
given
them
that
believe
Galatians
But
before
faith
came
were
kept
ward
under
the
law
shut
unto
the
faith
which
should
afterwards
revealed
Galatians
that
the
law
become
our
tutor
bring
unto
Christ
that
might
justified
faith
Galatians
But
now
that
faith
come
are
longer
under
tutor
Galatians
For
are
all
sons
God
through
faith
Christ
Jesus
Galatians
For
many
you
were
baptized
into
Christ
did
put
Christ
Galatians
There
can
neither
Jew
nor
Greek
there
can
neither
bond
nor
free
there
can
male
and
female
for
all
are
one
man
Christ
Jesus
Galatians
And
are
Christ
then
are
Abraham
seed
heirs
according
promise
Galatians
But
say
that
long
the
heir
child
differeth
nothing
from
bondservant
though
lord
all
Galatians
but
under
guardians
and
stewards
until
the
day
appointed
the
father
Galatians
also
when
were
children
were
held
bondage
under
the
rudiments
the
world
Galatians
but
when
the
fulness
the
time
came
God
sent
forth
his
Son
born
woman
born
under
the
law
Galatians
that
might
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
law
that
might
receive
the
adoption
sons
Galatians
And
because
are
sons
God
sent
forth
the
Spirit
his
Son
into
our
hearts
crying
Abba
Father
Galatians
that
thou
art
longer
bondservant
but
son
and
son
then
heir
through
God
Galatians
Howbeit
that
time
not
knowing
God
were
bondage
them
that
nature
are
gods
Galatians
but
now
that
have
come
know
God
rather
known
God
how
turn
back
again
the
weak
and
beggarly
rudiments
whereunto
desire
bondage
over
again
Galatians
observe
days
and
months
and
seasons
and
years
Galatians
afraid
you
lest
any
means
have
bestowed
labor
upon
you
vain
Galatians
beseech
you
brethren
become
for
also
become
are
did
wrong
Galatians
but
know
that
because
infirmity
the
flesh
preached
the
gospel
unto
you
the
first
time
Galatians
and
that
which
was
temptation
you
flesh
despised
not
nor
rejected
but
received
angel
God
even
Christ
Jesus
Galatians
Where
then
that
gratulation
yourselves
for
bear
you
witness
that
possible
would
have
plucked
out
your
eyes
and
given
them
Galatians
then
become
your
enemy
telling
you
the
truth
Galatians
They
zealously
seek
you
good
way
nay
they
desire
shut
you
out
that
may
seek
them
Galatians
But
good
zealously
sought
good
matter
all
times
and
not
only
when
present
with
you
Galatians
little
children
whom
again
travail
until
Christ
formed
you
Galatians
but
could
wish
present
with
you
now
and
change
tone
for
perplexed
about
you
Galatians
Tell
that
desire
under
the
law
not
hear
the
law
Galatians
For
written
that
Abraham
had
two
sons
one
the
handmaid
and
one
the
freewoman
Galatians
Howbeit
the
son
the
handmaid
born
after
the
flesh
but
the
son
the
freewoman
born
through
promise
Galatians
Which
things
contain
allegory
for
these
women
are
two
covenants
one
from
mount
Sinai
bearing
children
unto
bondage
which
Hagar
Galatians
Now
this
Hagar
mount
Sinai
Arabia
and
answereth
the
Jerusalem
that
now
for
she
bondage
with
her
children
Galatians
But
the
Jerusalem
that
above
free
which
our
mother
Galatians
For
written
Rejoice
thou
barren
that
bearest
not
Break
forth
and
cry
thou
that
travailest
not
For
more
are
the
children
the
desolate
than
her
that
hath
the
husband
Galatians
Now
brethren
Isaac
was
are
children
promise
Galatians
But
then
that
was
born
after
the
flesh
persecuted
him
that
was
born
after
the
Spirit
also
now
Galatians
Howbeit
what
saith
the
scripture
Cast
out
the
handmaid
and
her
son
for
the
son
the
handmaid
shall
not
inherit
with
the
son
the
freewoman
Galatians
Wherefore
brethren
are
not
children
handmaid
but
the
freewoman
Galatians
For
freedom
did
Christ
set
free
stand
fast
therefore
and
not
entangled
again
yoke
bondage
Galatians
Behold
Paul
say
unto
you
that
receive
circumcision
Christ
will
profit
you
nothing
Galatians
Yea
testify
again
every
man
that
receiveth
circumcision
that
debtor
the
whole
law
Galatians
are
severed
from
Christ
who
would
justified
the
law
are
fallen
away
from
grace
Galatians
For
through
the
Spirit
faith
wait
for
the
hope
righteousness
Galatians
For
Christ
Jesus
neither
circumcision
availeth
anything
nor
uncircumcision
but
faith
working
through
love
Galatians
were
running
well
who
hindered
you
that
should
not
obey
the
truth
Galatians
This
persuasion
came
not
him
that
calleth
you
Galatians
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
lump
Galatians
have
confidence
you
ward
the
Lord
that
will
none
otherwise
minded
but
that
troubleth
you
shall
bear
his
judgment
whosoever
Galatians
But
brethren
still
preach
circumcision
why
still
persecuted
then
hath
the
stumbling
block
the
cross
been
done
away
Galatians
would
that
they
that
unsettle
you
would
even
beyond
circumcision
Galatians
For
brethren
were
called
for
freedom
only
use
not
your
freedom
for
occasion
the
flesh
but
through
love
servants
one
another
Galatians
For
the
whole
law
fulfilled
one
word
even
this
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
thyself
Galatians
But
bite
and
devour
one
another
take
heed
that
not
consumed
one
another
Galatians
But
say
Walk
the
Spirit
and
shall
not
fulfil
the
lust
the
flesh
Galatians
For
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
Spirit
and
the
Spirit
against
the
flesh
for
these
are
contrary
the
one
the
other
that
may
not
the
things
that
would
Galatians
But
are
led
the
Spirit
are
not
under
the
law
Galatians
Now
the
works
the
flesh
are
manifest
which
are
these
fornication
uncleanness
lasciviousness
Galatians
idolatry
sorcery
enmities
strife
jealousies
wraths
factions
divisions
parties
Galatians
envyings
drunkenness
revellings
and
such
like
which
forewarn
you
even
did
forewarn
you
that
they
who
practise
such
things
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
God
Galatians
But
the
fruit
the
Spirit
love
joy
peace
longsuffering
kindness
goodness
faithfulness
Galatians
meekness
self
control
against
such
there
law
Galatians
And
they
that
are
Christ
Jesus
have
crucified
the
flesh
with
the
passions
and
the
lusts
thereof
Galatians
live
the
Spirit
the
Spirit
let
also
walk
Galatians
Let
not
become
vainglorious
provoking
one
another
envying
one
another
Galatians
Brethren
even
man
overtaken
any
trespass
who
are
spiritual
restore
such
one
spirit
gentleness
looking
thyself
lest
thou
also
tempted
Galatians
Bear
one
another
burdens
and
fulfil
the
law
Christ
Galatians
For
man
thinketh
himself
something
when
nothing
deceiveth
himself
Galatians
But
let
each
man
prove
his
own
work
and
then
shall
have
his
glorying
regard
himself
alone
and
not
his
neighbor
Galatians
For
each
man
shall
bear
his
own
burden
Galatians
But
let
him
that
taught
the
word
communicate
unto
him
that
teacheth
all
good
things
Galatians
not
deceived
God
not
mocked
for
whatsoever
man
soweth
that
shall
also
reap
Galatians
For
that
soweth
unto
his
own
flesh
shall
the
flesh
reap
corruption
but
that
soweth
unto
the
Spirit
shall
the
Spirit
reap
eternal
life
Galatians
And
let
not
weary
well
doing
for
due
season
shall
reap
faint
not
Galatians
then
have
opportunity
let
work
that
which
good

all
men
and
especially
toward
them
that
are
the

Galatians
See
with
how
large
letters
write
unto
you
with
mine
own
hand
Galatians
many
desire
make
fair
show
the
flesh
they
compel
you
circumcised
only
that
they
may
not
persecuted
for
the
cross
Christ
Galatians
For
not
even
they
who
receive
circumcision
themselves
keep
the
law
but
they
desire
have
you
circumcised
that
they
may
glory
your
flesh
Galatians
But
far
from
glory
save
the
cross
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
through
which
the
world
hath
been
crucified
unto
and
unto
the
world
Galatians
For
neither
circumcision
anything
nor
uncircumcision
but
new
creature
Galatians
And
many
shall
walk
this

peace

Henceforth

For

Wherefore

the

Uncircumcision
that
which

the

one
new

might
reconcile
them
both
one

thereby
Ephesians

preached
peace
you
that

off

peace
them
that

Ephesians
for
through

both

our
access
one

Wherefore

For

But
unto
each

Wherefore

Now

the
earth
Ephesians
that
descended
the
same
also
that
ascended
far
above
all
the
heavens
that

fill
all

Ephesians
And
gave
some
apostles
and
some

and
some
evangelists
and
some
pastors
and
teachers
Ephesians
for
the
perfecting
the
saints
unto

Ephesians
This
say
therefore
and
testify
the
Lord
that
longer
walk
the
Gentiles
also
walk

Ephesians
being
darkened
their

because
the
hardening

Ephesians
who
being
past

gave
themselves
lasciviousness
work
all
uncleanness
with
greediness
Ephesians
But
did
not
learn
Christ
Ephesians
that
heard

and
were
taught

Jesus
Ephesians
that
put
away

Ephesians
and

Ephesians
Wherefore
putting

falsehood
speak
truth
each

Ephesians
angry

not
let

Ephesians
neither

Ephesians
Let

Ephesians
Let

Ephesians
And
grieve
not
the
Holy

Ephesians
Let

Ephesians
and
kind
one

Christ
forgave
you
Ephesians
therefore
imitators
God
beloved

and

even
Christ
also
loved
you
and
gave

Ephesians
But
fornication
and
all
uncleanness
covetousness
let
not
even

among
you
becometh
saints
Ephesians
nor
filthiness
nor
foolish
talking
jesting
which
are
not
befitting

rather
giving

Ephesians
For
this
know
surety
that
fornicator
nor
unclean
person
nor
covetous
man
who
idolater
hath
any

Christ
and

Ephesians
Let
man
deceive
you
with
empty
words
for
because
these
things
cometh
the
wrath
God
upon

Ephesians
proving

and
have
fellowship
with
the
unfruitful
works
darkness
but
rather
even
reprove
them
Ephesians
for
the

Ephesians
But
all

when
they
are
reproved

Ephesians
Wherefore
saith
Awake

Ephesians
Look
therefore
carefully
how

Wherefore

Now

have

But
live

this
shall
bring

who

man
humbled
himself
becoming
obedient

Philippians
Wherefore
also
God
highly
exalted
him

Philippians
that

Philippians
all

Philippians
that

But
hope
the
Lord
Jesus
send
Timothy
shortly
unto
you
that

may
good
comfort
when

your
state
Philippians
For
have
man
likeminded
who
will
care
truly
for
your

Philippians
For
they
all
seek
their

Philippians
But

the
proof

Philippians
Him
therefore
hope
send

how
will
with

but
trust
the

that
myself

unto
you
word
only
but
also
power
and
the
Holy
Spirit
and
much
assurance
even
know
what
manner
men
showed
ourselves
toward
you
for
your
sake
Thessalonians
And
became
imitators
and
the
Lord
having
received
the
word
much
affliction
with
joy
the
Holy
Spirit
Thessalonians
that
became
ensample
all
that
believe
Macedonia
and
Achaia
Thessalonians
For
from
you
hath
sounded
forth
the
word
the
Lord
not
only
Macedonia
and
Achaia
but
every
place
your
faith
God
ward
gone
forth
that
need
not
speak
anything
Thessalonians
For
they
themselves
report
concerning
what
manner
entering
had
unto
you
and
how
turned
unto
God
from
idols
serve
living
and
true
God
Thessalonians
and
wait
for
his
Son
from
heaven
whom
raised
from
the
dead
even
Jesus
who
delivereth
from
the
wrath
come
Thessalonians
For
yourselves
brethren
know
our
entering
unto
you
that
hath
not
been
found
vain
Thessalonians
but
having
suffered
before
and
been
shamefully
treated
know
Philippi
waxed
bold
our
God
speak
unto
you
the
gospel
God
much
conflict
Thessalonians
For
our
exhortation
not
error
nor
uncleanness
nor
guile
Thessalonians
but
even
have
been
approved
God
intrusted
with
the
gospel
speak
not
pleasing
men
but
God
who
proveth
our
hearts
Thessalonians
For
neither
any
time
were
found
using
words
flattery
know
nor
cloak
covetousness
God
witness
Thessalonians
nor
seeking
glory
men
neither
from
you
nor
from
others
when
might
have
claimed
authority
apostles
Christ
Thessalonians
But
were
gentle
the
midst
you
when
nurse
cherisheth
her
own
children
Thessalonians
even
being
affectionately
desirous
you
were
well
pleased
impart
unto
you
not
the
gospel
God
only
but
also
our
own
souls
because
were
become
very
dear
Thessalonians
For
remember
brethren
our
labor
and
travail
working
night
and
day
that
might
not
burden
any
you
preached
unto
you
the
gospel
God
Thessalonians
are
witnesses
and
God
also
how
holily
and
righteously
and
unblamably
behaved
ourselves
toward
you
that
believe
Thessalonians
know
how
dealt
with
each
one
you
father
with
his
own
children
exhorting
you
and
encouraging
you
and
testifying
Thessalonians
the
end
that
should
walk
worthily
God
who
calleth
you
into
his
own
kingdom
and
glory
Thessalonians
And
for
this
cause
also
thank
God
without
ceasing
that
when
received
from
the
word
the
message
even
the
word
God
accepted
not
the
word
men
but
truth
the
word
God
which
also
worketh
you
that
believe
Thessalonians
For
brethren
became
imitators
the
churches
God
which
are
Judæa
Christ
Jesus
for
also
suffered
the
same
things
your
own
countrymen
even
they
did
the
Jews
Thessalonians
who
both
killed
the
Lord
Jesus
and
the
prophets
and
drove
out
and
please
not
God
and
are
contrary
all
men
Thessalonians
forbidding
speak
the
Gentiles
that
they
may
saved
fill
their
sins
always
but
the
wrath
come
upon
them
the
uttermost
Thessalonians
But
brethren
being
bereaved
you
for
short
season
presence
not
heart
endeavored
the
more
exceedingly
see
your
face
with
great
desire
Thessalonians
because
would
fain
have
come
unto
you
Paul
once
and
again
and
Satan
hindered
Thessalonians
For
what
our
hope
joy
crown
glorying
Are
not
even
before
our
Lord
Jesus
his
coming
Thessalonians
For
are
our
glory
and
our
joy
Thessalonians
Wherefore
when
could
longer
forbear
thought
good
left
behind
Athens
alone
Thessalonians
and
sent
Timothy
our
brother
and
God
minister
the
gospel
Christ
establish
you
and
comfort
you
concerning
your
faith
Thessalonians
that
man
moved
these
afflictions
for
yourselves
know
that
hereunto
are
appointed
Thessalonians
For
verily
when
were
with
you
told
you
beforehand
that
are
suffer
affliction
even
came
pass
and
know
Thessalonians
For
this
cause
also
when
could
longer
forbear
sent
that
might
know
your
faith
lest
any
means
the
tempter
had
tempted
you
and
our
labor
should
vain
Thessalonians
But
when
Timothy
came
even
now
unto
from
you
and
brought
glad
tidings
your
faith
and
love
and
that
have
good
remembrance
always
longing
see
even
also
see
you
Thessalonians
for
this
cause
brethren
were
comforted
over
you
all
our
distress
and
affliction
through
your
faith
Thessalonians
for
now
live
stand
fast
the
Lord
Thessalonians
For
what
thanksgiving
can
render
again
unto
God
for
you
for
all
the
joy
wherewith
joy
for
your
sakes
before
our
God
Thessalonians
night
and
day
praying
exceedingly
that
may
see
your
face
and
may
perfect
that
which
lacking
your
faith
Thessalonians
Now
may
our
God
and
Father
himself
and
our
Lord
Jesus
direct
our
way
unto
you
Thessalonians
and
the
Lord
make
you
increase
and
abound
love
one
toward
another
and
toward
all
men
even
also
toward
you
Thessalonians
the
end
may
establish
your
hearts
unblamable
holiness
before
our
God
and
Father
the
coming
our
Lord
Jesus
with
all
his
saints
Thessalonians
Finally
then
brethren
beseech
and
exhort
you
the
Lord
Jesus
that
received
how
ought
walk
and
please
God
even
walk
that
abound
more
and
more
Thessalonians
For
know
what
charge
gave
you
through
the
Lord
Jesus
Thessalonians
For
this
the
will
God
even
your
sanctification
that
abstain
from
fornication
Thessalonians
that
each
one
you
know
how
possess
himself
his
own
vessel
sanctification
and
honor
Thessalonians
not
the
passion
lust
even
the
Gentiles
who
know
not
God
Thessalonians
that
man
transgress
and
wrong
his
brother
the
matter
because
the
Lord
avenger
all
these
things
also
forewarned
you
and
testified
Thessalonians
For
God
called
not
for
uncleanness
but
sanctification
Thessalonians
Therefore
that
rejecteth
rejecteth
not
man
but
God
who
giveth
his
Holy
Spirit
unto
you
Thessalonians
But
concerning
love
the
brethren
have
need
that
one
write
unto
you
for
yourselves
are
taught
God
love
one
another
Thessalonians
for
indeed
toward
all
the
brethren
that
are
all
Macedonia
But
exhort
you
brethren
that
abound
more
and
more
Thessalonians
and
that
study
quiet
and
your
own
business
and
work
with
your
hands
even
charged
you
Thessalonians
that
may
walk
becomingly
toward
them
that
are
without
and
may
have
need
nothing
Thessalonians
But
would
not
have
you
ignorant
brethren
concerning
them
that
fall
asleep
that
sorrow
not
even
the
rest
who
have
hope
Thessalonians
For
believe
that
Jesus
died
and
rose
again
even
them
also
that
are
fallen
asleep
Jesus
will
God
bring
with
him
Thessalonians
For
this
say
unto
you
the
word
the
Lord
that
that
are
alive
that
are
left
unto
the
coming
the
Lord
shall
wise
precede
them
that
are
fallen
asleep
Thessalonians
For
the
Lord
himself
shall
descend
from
heaven
with
shout
with
the
voice
the
archangel
and
with
the
trump
God
and
the
dead
Christ
shall
rise
first
Thessalonians
then
that
are
alive
that
are
left
shall
together
with
them
caught
the
clouds
meet
the
Lord
the
air
and
shall
ever
with
the
Lord
Thessalonians
Wherefore
comfort
one
another
with
these
words
Thessalonians
But
concerning
the
times
and
the
seasons
brethren
have
need
that
aught
written
unto
you
Thessalonians
For
yourselves
know
perfectly
that
the
day
the
Lord
cometh
thief
the
night
Thessalonians
When
they
are
saying
Peace
and
safety
then
sudden
destruction
cometh
upon
them
travail
upon
woman
with
child
and
they
shall
wise
escape
Thessalonians
But
brethren
are
not
darkness
that
that
day
should
overtake
you
thief
Thessalonians
for
are
all
sons
light
and
sons
the
day
are
not
the
night
nor
darkness
Thessalonians
then
let
not
sleep
the
rest
but
let
watch
and
sober
Thessalonians
For
they
that
sleep
sleep
the
night
and
they
that
are
drunken
are
drunken
the
night
Thessalonians
But
let
since
are
the
day
sober
putting
the
breastplate
faith
and
love
and
for
helmet
the
hope
salvation
Thessalonians
For
God
appointed
not
unto
wrath
but
unto
the
obtaining
salvation
through
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
Thessalonians
who
died
for
that
whether
wake
sleep
should
live
together
with
him
Thessalonians
Wherefore
exhort
one
another
and
build
each
other
even
also
Thessalonians
But
beseech
you
brethren
know
them
that
labor
among
you
and
are
over
you
the
Lord
and
admonish
you
Thessalonians
and
esteem
them
exceeding
highly
love
for
their
work
sake
peace
among
yourselves
Thessalonians
And
exhort
you
brethren
admonish
the
disorderly
encourage
the
fainthearted
support
the
weak
longsuffering
toward
all
Thessalonians
See
that
none
render
unto
any
one
evil
for
evil
but
always
follow
after
that
which
good
one
toward
another
and
toward
all
Thessalonians
Rejoice
always
Thessalonians
pray
without
ceasing
Thessalonians
everything
give
thanks
for
this
the
will
God
Christ
Jesus
you
ward
Thessalonians
Quench
not
the
Spirit
Thessalonians
despise
not
prophesyings
Thessalonians
prove
all
things
hold
fast
that
which

Thessalonians
abstain
from
every
form
evil
Thessalonians
And
the
God
peace
himself

you
wholly
and

spirit
and
soul
and
body
preserved
entire
without
blame
the

Thessalonians
And
now

For

And

But

Amen
Timothy
This
charge
commit
unto
thee
child
Timothy
according
the
prophecies
which
led
the
way
thee
that
them
thou
mayest
war
the
good
warfare
Timothy
holding
faith
and
good
conscience
which
some
having
thrust
from
them
made
shipwreck
concerning
the
faith
Timothy
whom
Hymenæus
and
Alexander
whom
delivered
unto
Satan
that
they
might
taught
not
blaspheme
Timothy
exhort
therefore
first
all
that
supplications
prayers
intercessions
thanksgivings
made
for
all
men
Timothy
for
kings
and
all
that
are
high
place
that
may
lead
tranquil
and
quiet
life
all
godliness
and
gravity
Timothy
This
good
and
acceptable
the
sight
God
our
Saviour
Timothy
who
would
have
all
men
saved
and
come
the
knowledge
the
truth
Timothy
For
there
one
God
one
mediator
also
between
God
and
men
himself
man
Christ
Jesus
Timothy
who
gave
himself
ransom
for
all
the
testimony
borne
its
own
times
Timothy
whereunto
was
appointed
preacher
and
apostle
speak
the
truth
lie
not
teacher
the
Gentiles
faith
and
truth
Timothy
desire
therefore
that
the
men
pray
every
place
lifting
holy
hands
without
wrath
and
disputing
Timothy
like
manner
that
women
adorn
themselves
modest
apparel
with
shamefastness
and
sobriety
not
with
braided
hair
and
gold
pearls
costly
raiment
Timothy
but
which
becometh
women
professing
godliness
through
good
works
Timothy
Let
woman
learn
quietness
with
all
subjection
Timothy
But
permit
not
woman
teach
nor
have
dominion
over
man
but
quietness
Timothy
For
Adam
was
first
formed
then
Eve
Timothy
and
Adam
was
not
beguiled
but
the
woman
being
beguiled
hath
fallen
into
transgression
Timothy
but
she
shall
saved
through
her
child
bearing
they
continue
faith
and
love
and
sanctification
with
sobriety
Timothy
Faithful
the
saying
man
seeketh
the
office

desireth
good
work
Timothy
The
bishop
therefore
must
without

Timothy
brawler

not

Timothy
one
that
ruleth
well
his
own
house
having
his
children
subjection
with
all
gravity
Timothy
but
man
knoweth
not
how
rule
his
own
house
how
shall
take
care
the
church
God
Timothy
not
novice
lest
being
puffed
fall
into
the
condemnation
the
devil
Timothy
Moreover
must
have
good
testimony
from
them
that
are
without
lest
fall
into
reproach
and
the
snare
the
devil
Timothy
Deacons
like
manner
must
grave
not
double
tongued
not
given
much
wine
not
greedy
filthy
lucre
Timothy
holding
the
mystery
the

Timothy
And
let
these
also
first
proved
then
let
them

Timothy
Women
like

temperate
faithful
all

Timothy
Let
deacons
husbands
one
wife

their
children

their
own
houses

Timothy
For
they
that
have
served
well
deacons
gain
themselves
good
standing
and
great
boldness
the
faith
which
Christ
Jesus
Timothy
These
things
write
unto
thee
hoping
come
unto
thee
shortly
Timothy
but
tarry
long
that
thou
mayest
know
how
men
ought
behave
themselves
the
house
God
which

And
without

Justified

Received

Timothy
But
the
Spirit
saith
expressly
that
later
times
some
shall
fall
away
from
the
faith
giving
heed
seducing
spirits
and
doctrines
demons
Timothy
through
the
hypocrisy
men
that
speak
lies
branded
their
own
conscience
with
hot
iron
Timothy
forbidding
marry
and
commanding
abstain
from
meats
which
God
created

with
thanksgiving
them
that

Timothy
For
every

with
thanksgiving
Timothy
for

followed
until
now
Timothy
but
refuse

old
wives
fables
And
exercise
thyself
unto

Timothy
for

profitable
for

but
godliness
profitable
for
all
things
having

that

Timothy
Faithful
the

and
worthy
all
acceptation
Timothy
For
this
end
labor
and
strive
because
have
our
hope
set
the
living
God
who

men
specially
them

These

Timothy
Let

Till

Timothy
Take

Continue
these

for
doing
this
thou
shalt

Rebuke

Timothy
the
elder
women

Honor
widows
that

widows
indeed
Timothy
But
any
widow
hath
children

let
them
learn

show
piety
towards
their

family
and
requite
their
parents
for
this
acceptable

Timothy
Now
she
that
widow
indeed
and
desolate
hath
her
hope
set

and
continueth
supplications
and
prayers
night
and
day
Timothy
But
she
that
giveth
herself
pleasure
dead
while

Timothy
These
things
also
command
that
they

Timothy
But
any

specially
his

Timothy
Let

Timothy
But
younger
widows
refuse
for
when
they
have
waxed
wanton
against
Christ
they
desire

Timothy
having
condemnation
because
they
have
rejected

Timothy
And
withal
they

and
not

idle
but

that
the
younger

Timothy
Let

For

These

For

Hebrews
God
having
old
time
spoken
unto
the
fathers
the
prophets
divers
portions
and
divers
manners
Hebrews
hath
the
end
these
days
spoken
unto
his
Son
whom
appointed
heir
all
things
through
whom
also
made
the
worlds
Hebrews
who
being
the
effulgence
his
glory
and
the
very
image
his
substance
and
upholding
all
things
the
word
his
power
when
had
made
purification
sins
sat
down
the
right
hand
the
Majesty
high
Hebrews
having
become
much
better
than
the
angels
hath
inherited
more
excellent
name
than
they
Hebrews
For
unto
which
the
angels
said
any
time
Thou
art
Son
This
day
have
begotten
thee
and
again
will
him
Father
And
shall
Son
Hebrews
And
when
again
bringeth
the
firstborn
into
the
world
saith
And
let
all
the
angels
God
worship
him
Hebrews
And
the
angels
saith
Who
maketh
his
angels
winds
And
his
ministers
flame
fire
Hebrews
but
the
Son
saith
Thy
throne
God
forever
and
ever
And
the
sceptre
uprightness
the
sceptre
thy
kingdom
Hebrews
Thou
hast
loved
righteousness
and
hated
iniquity
Therefore
God
thy
God
hath
anointed
thee
With
the
oil
gladness
above
thy
fellows
Hebrews
And
Thou
Lord
the
beginning
didst
lay
the
foundation
the
earth
And
the
heavens
are
the
works
thy
hands
Hebrews
They
shall
perish
but
thou
continuest
And
they
all
shall
wax
old

Hebrews
And
mantle
shalt
thou
roll
them
garment
and
they
shall
changed
But
thou
art
the
same
And
thy
years
shall
not
fail
Hebrews
But
which
the
angels
hath
said
any
time
Sit
thou
right
hand
Till
make
thine
enemies
the
footstool
thy
feet
Hebrews
Are
they
not
all
ministering
spirits
sent
forth
service
for
the
sake
them
that
shall
inherit
salvation
Hebrews
Therefore
ought
give
the
more
earnest
heed
the
things
that
were
heard
lest
haply
drift
away
from
them
Hebrews
For
the
word
spoken
through
angels
proved
stedfast
and
every
transgression
and
disobedience
received
just
recompense
reward
Hebrews
how
shall
escape
neglect
great
salvation
which
having
the
first
been
spoken
through
the
Lord
was
confirmed
unto
them
that
heard
Hebrews
God
also
bearing
witness
with
them
both
signs
and
wonders
and
manifold
powers
and
gifts
the
Holy
Spirit
according
his
own
will
Hebrews
For
not
unto
angels
did
subject
the
world
come
whereof
speak
Hebrews
But
one
hath
somewhere
testified
saying
What
man
that
thou
art
mindful
him
the
son
man
that
thou
visitest
him
Hebrews
Thou
madest
him
little
lower
than
the
angels
Thou
crownedst
him
with
glory
and
honor
And
didst
set
him
over
the
works
thy
hands
Hebrews
Thou
didst
put
all
things
subjection
under
his
feet
For
that
subjected
all
things
unto
him
left
nothing
that
not
subject
him
But
now
see
not
yet
all
things
subjected
him
Hebrews
But
behold
him
who
hath
been
made
little
lower
than
the
angels
even
Jesus
because
the
suffering
death
crowned
with
glory
and
honor
that
the
grace
God
should
taste
death
for
every
man
Hebrews
For
became
him
for
whom
are
all
things
and
through
whom
are
all
things
bringing
many
sons
unto
glory
make
the
author
their
salvation
perfect
through
sufferings
Hebrews
For
both
that
sanctifieth
and
they
that
are
sanctified
are
all
one
for
which
cause
not
ashamed
call
them
brethren
Hebrews
saying
will
declare
thy
name
unto
brethren
the
midst
the
congregation
will
sing
thy
praise
Hebrews
And
again
will
put
trust
him
And
again
Behold
and
the
children
whom
God
hath
given
Hebrews
Since
then
the
children
are
sharers
flesh
and
blood
also
himself
like
manner
partook
the
same
that
through
death
might
bring
nought
him
that
had
the
power
death
that
the
devil
Hebrews
and
might
deliver
all
them
who
through
fear
death
were
all
their
lifetime
subject
bondage
Hebrews
For
verily
not
angels
doth
give
help
but
giveth
help
the
seed
Abraham
Hebrews
Wherefore
behooved
him
all
things
made
like
unto
his
brethren
that
might
become
merciful
and
faithful
high
priest
things
pertaining
God
make
propitiation
for
the
sins
the
people
Hebrews
For
that
himself
hath
suffered
being
tempted
able
succor
them
that
are
tempted
Hebrews
Wherefore
holy
brethren
partakers
heavenly
calling
consider
the
Apostle
and
High
Priest
our
confession
even
Jesus
Hebrews
who
was
faithful
him
that
appointed
him
also
was
Moses
all
his
house
Hebrews
For
hath
been
counted
worthy
more
glory
than
Moses
much
that
built
the
house
hath
more
honor
than
the
house
Hebrews
For
every
house
builded
some
one
but
that
built
all
things
God
Hebrews
And
Moses
indeed
was
faithful
all
his
house
servant
for
testimony
those
things
which
were
afterward
spoken
Hebrews
but
Christ
son
over
his
house
whose
house
are
hold
fast
our
boldness
and
the
glorying
our
hope
firm
unto
the
end
Hebrews
Wherefore
even
the
Holy
Spirit
saith
day
shall
hear
his
voice
Hebrews
Harden
not
your
hearts
the
provocation
Like
the
day
the
trial
the
wilderness
Hebrews
Where
your
fathers
tried
proving
And
saw
works
forty
years
Hebrews
Wherefore
was
displeased
with
this
generation
And
said
They
always
err
their
heart
But
they
did
not
know
ways
Hebrews
sware
wrath
They
shall
not
enter
into
rest
Hebrews
Take
heed
brethren
lest
haply
there
shall
any
one
you
evil
heart
unbelief
falling
away
from
the
living
God
Hebrews
but
exhort
one
another
day
day
long
called
day
lest
any
one
you
hardened
the
deceitfulness
sin
Hebrews
for
are
become
partakers
Christ
hold
fast
the
beginning
our
confidence
firm
unto
the
end
Hebrews
while
said
day
shall
hear
his
voice
Harden
not
your
hearts
the
provocation
Hebrews
For
who
when
they
heard
did
provoke
nay
did
not
all
they
that
came
out
Egypt
Moses
Hebrews
And
with
whom
was
displeased
forty
years
was
not
with
them
that
sinned
whose
bodies
fell
the
wilderness
Hebrews
And
whom
sware
that
they
should
not
enter
into
his
rest
but
them
that
were
disobedient
Hebrews
And
see
that
they
were
not
able
enter
because
unbelief
Hebrews
Let
fear
therefore
lest
haply
promise
being
left
entering
into
his
rest
any
one
you
should
seem
have
come
short
Hebrews
For
indeed
have
had
good
tidings
preached
unto
even
also
they
but
the
word
hearing
did
not
profit
them
because
was
not
united
faith
with
them
that
heard
Hebrews
For
who
have
believed
enter
into
that
rest
even
hath
said
sware
wrath
They
shall
not
enter
into
rest
although
the
works
were
finished
from
the
foundation
the
world
Hebrews
For
hath
said
somewhere
the
seventh
day
this
wise
And
God
rested
the
seventh
day
from
all
his
works
Hebrews
and
this
place
again
They
shall
not
enter
into
rest
Hebrews
Seeing
therefore
remaineth
that
some
should
enter
thereinto
and
they
whom
the
good
tidings
were
before
preached
failed
enter
because
disobedience
Hebrews
again
defineth
certain
day
day
saying
David
long
time
afterward
even
hath
been
said
before
day
shall
hear
his
voice
Harden
not
your
hearts
Hebrews
For
Joshua
had
given
them
rest
would
not
have
spoken
afterward
another
day
Hebrews
There
remaineth
therefore
sabbath
rest
for
the
people
God
Hebrews
For
that
entered
into
his
rest
hath
himself
also
rested
from
his
works
God
did
from
his
Hebrews
Let
therefore
give
diligence

For

And

Having

For

Let
therefore

Hebrews
For

taken

for
men

that
may
offer
both

and

Hebrews
who

and

thereof

Hebrews
And
man
taketh
the
honor
unto

but
when
called

even

Aaron
Hebrews
Christ
also
glorified
not

that
spake
unto
him
Thou

This

Hebrews
saith

Thou

After

though

and

Hebrews
named
God
high
priest
after
the
order
Melchizedek
Hebrews
whom
have
many
things
say
and
hard
interpretation

become
dull

Hebrews
For
when

the
time
ought
teachers
have
need
again
that
some
one

you
the
rudiments
the
first
principles
the
oracles

milk

Hebrews
For
every
one
that
partaketh
milk
without

Hebrews
But
solid
food
for
fullgrown
men
even
those
who
reason
use

their
senses
exercised

good
and
evil
Hebrews
Wherefore
leaving
the
doctrine
the
first
principles
Christ
let
press
unto
perfection
not
laying
again
foundation
repentance
from
dead
works
and
faith
toward
God
Hebrews
the
teaching
baptisms
and
laying
hands
and
resurrection
the
dead
and
eternal
judgment
Hebrews
And
this
will
God
permit
Hebrews
For
touching
those
who
were
once
enlightened
and
tasted
the
heavenly
gift
and
were
made
partakers
the
Holy
Spirit
Hebrews
and
tasted
the
good
word
God
and
the
powers
the
age

Hebrews
and
then
fell
away
impossible
renew
them
again
unto
repentance
seeing
they
crucify
themselves
the
Son
God
afresh
and
put
him
open
shame
Hebrews
For
the
land
which
hath
drunk
the
rain
that
cometh
oft
upon
and
bringeth
forth
herbs

for
them
for
whose
sake
also
tilled
receiveth
blessing
from
God
Hebrews
but
beareth
thorns
and
thistles
rejected
and
nigh
unto
curse
whose
end
burned
Hebrews
But
beloved
are
persuaded
better
things
you
and
things
that
accompany
salvation
though
thus
speak
Hebrews
for
God
not
unrighteous
forget
your
work
and
the
love
which
showed
toward
his
name
that
ministered
unto
the
saints
and
still
minister
Hebrews
And
desire
that
each
one
you
may
show
the
same
diligence
unto
the
fulness
hope
even
the
end
Hebrews
that
not
sluggish
but
imitators
them
who
through
faith
and
patience
inherit
the
promises
Hebrews
For
when
God
made
promise
Abraham
since
could
swear
none
greater
sware
himself
Hebrews
saying
Surely
blessing
will
bless
thee
and
multiplying
will
multiply
thee
Hebrews
And
thus
having
patiently
endured
obtained
the
promise
Hebrews
For
men
swear
the
greater
and
every
dispute
theirs
the
oath
final
for
confirmation
Hebrews
Wherein
God
being
minded
show
more
abundantly
unto
the
heirs
the
promise
the
immutability
his
counsel
interposed
with
oath
Hebrews
that
two
immutable
things
which
impossible
for
God
lie
may
have
strong
encouragement
who
have
fled
for
refuge
lay
hold
the
hope
set
before
Hebrews
which
have
anchor
the
soul
hope
both
sure
and
stedfast
and
entering
into
that
which
within
the
veil
Hebrews
whither
forerunner
Jesus
entered
for
having
become
high
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
Melchizedek
Hebrews
For
this
Melchizedek
king
Salem
priest
God
Most
High
who
met
Abraham
returning
from
the
slaughter
the
kings
and
blessed
him
Hebrews
whom
also
Abraham
divided
tenth
part
all
being
first
interpretation
King
righteousness
and
then
also
King
Salem
which
King
peace
Hebrews
without
father
without
mother
without
genealogy
having
neither
beginning
days
nor
end
life
but
made
like
unto
the
Son
God
abideth
priest
continually
Hebrews
Now
consider
how
great
this
man
was
unto
whom
Abraham
the
patriarch
gave
tenth
out
the
chief
spoils
Hebrews
And
they
indeed
the
sons
Levi
that
receive
the
priest
office
have
commandment
take
tithes
the
people
according
the
law
that
their
brethren
though
these
have
come
out
the
loins
Abraham
Hebrews
but
whose
genealogy
not
counted
from
them
hath
taken
tithes
Abraham
and
hath
blessed
him
that
hath
the
promises
Hebrews
But
without
any
dispute
the
less
blessed
the
better
Hebrews
And
here
men
that
die
receive
tithes
but
there
one
whom
witnessed
that
liveth
Hebrews
And
say
through
Abraham
even
Levi
who
receiveth
tithes
hath
paid
tithes
Hebrews
for
was
yet
the
loins
his
father
when
Melchizedek
met
him
Hebrews
Now
there
was
perfection
through
the
Levitical
priesthood
for
under
hath
the
people
received
the
law
what
further
need
was
there
that
another
priest
should
arise
after
the
order
Melchizedek
and
not
reckoned
after
the
order
Aaron
Hebrews
For
the
priesthood
being
changed
there
made
necessity
change
also
the
law
Hebrews
For
whom
these
things
are
said
belongeth
another
tribe
from
which
man
hath
given
attendance
the
altar
Hebrews
For
evident
that
our
Lord
hath
sprung
out
Judah
which
tribe
Moses
spake
nothing
concerning
priests
Hebrews
And
what
say
yet
more
abundantly
evident
after
the
likeness
Melchizedek
there
ariseth
another
priest
Hebrews
who
hath
been
made
not
after
the
law
carnal
commandment
but
after
the
power
endless
life
Hebrews
for
witnessed
him
Thou
art
priest
for
ever
After
the
order
Melchizedek
Hebrews
For
there
disannulling
foregoing
commandment
because
its
weakness
and
unprofitableness
Hebrews
for
the
law
made
nothing
perfect
and
bringing
thereupon
better
hope
through
which
draw
nigh
unto
God
Hebrews
And
inasmuch
not
without
the
taking
oath
Hebrews
for
they
indeed
have
been
made
priests
without
oath
but
with
oath
him
that
saith
him
The
Lord
sware
and
will
not
repent
himself
Thou
art
priest
for
ever
Hebrews
much
also
hath
Jesus
become
the
surety
better
covenant
Hebrews
And
they
indeed
have
been
made
priests
many
number
because
that
death
they
are
hindered
from
continuing
Hebrews
but
because
abideth
for
ever
hath
his
priesthood
unchangeable
Hebrews
Wherefore
also
able
save
the
uttermost
them
that
draw
near
unto
God
through
him
seeing
ever
liveth
make
intercession
for
them
Hebrews
For
such
high
priest
became
holy
guileless
undefiled
separated
from
sinners
and
made
higher
than
the
heavens
Hebrews
who
needeth
not
daily
like
those
high
priests
offer
sacrifices
first
for
his
own
sins
and
then
for
the
sins
the
people
for
this
did
once
for
all
when
offered
himself
Hebrews
For
the
law
appointeth
men
high
priests
having
infirmity
but
the
word
the
oath
which
was
after
the
law
appointeth
Son
perfected
for
evermore
Hebrews
Now
the
things
which
are
saying
the
chief
point
this
have
such
high
priest
who
sat
down
the
right
hand
the
throne
the
Majesty
the
heavens
Hebrews
minister
the
sanctuary
and
the
true
tabernacle
which
the
Lord
pitched
not
man
Hebrews
For
every
high
priest
appointed
offer
both
gifts
and
sacrifices
wherefore
necessary
that
this
high
priest
also
have
somewhat
offer
Hebrews
Now
were
earth
would
not
priest
all
seeing
there
are
those
who
offer
the
gifts
according
the
law
Hebrews
who
serve
that
which
copy
and
shadow
the
heavenly
things
even
Moses
warned
God
when
about
make
the
tabernacle
for
See
saith
that
thou
make
all
things
according
the
pattern
that
was
showed
thee
the
mount
Hebrews
But
now
hath
obtained
ministry
the
more
excellent
much
also
the
mediator
better
covenant
which
hath
been
enacted
upon
better
promises
Hebrews
For
that
first
covenant
had
been
faultless
then
would
place
have
been
sought
for
second
Hebrews
For
finding
fault
with
them
saith
Behold
the
days
come
saith
the
Lord
That
will
make
new
covenant
with
the
house
Israel
and
with
the
house
Judah
Hebrews
Not
according
the
covenant
that
made
with
their
fathers
the
day
that
took
them
the
hand
lead
them
forth
out
the
land
Egypt
For
they
continued
not
covenant
And
regarded
them
not
saith
the
Lord
Hebrews
For
this
the
covenant
that
will
make
with
the
house
Israel
After
those
days
saith
the
Lord
will
put
laws
into
their
mind
And
their
heart
also
will
write
them
And
will
them
God
And
they
shall
people
Hebrews
And
they
shall
not
teach
every
man
his
fellow
citizen
And
every
man
his
brother
saying
Know
the
Lord
For
all
shall
know
From
the
least
the
greatest
them
Hebrews
For
will
merciful
their
iniquities
And
their
sins
will
remember
more
Hebrews
that
saith
new
covenant
hath
made
the
first
old
But
that
which
becoming
old
and
waxeth
aged
nigh
unto
vanishing
away
Hebrews
Now
even
the
first
covenant
had
ordinances
divine
service
and
its
sanctuary
sanctuary
this
world
Hebrews
For
there
was
tabernacle
prepared
the
first
wherein
were
the
candlestick
and
the
table
and
the
showbread
which
called
the
Holy
place
Hebrews
And
after
the
second
veil
the
tabernacle
which
called
the
Holy
holies
Hebrews
having
golden
altar
incense
and
the
ark
the
covenant
overlaid
round
about
with
gold
wherein
was
golden
pot
holding
the
manna
and
Aaron
rod
that
budded
and
the
tables
the
covenant
Hebrews
and
above
cherubim
glory
overshadowing
the
mercy
seat
which
things
cannot
now
speak
severally
Hebrews
Now
these
things
having
been
thus
prepared
the
priests
continually
into
the
first
tabernacle
accomplishing
the
services
Hebrews
but
into
the
second
the
high
priest
alone
once
the
year
not
without
blood
which
offereth
for
himself
and
for
the
errors
the
people
Hebrews
the
Holy
Spirit
this
signifying
that
the
way
into
the
holy
place
hath
not
yet
been
made
manifest
while
the
first
tabernacle
yet
standing
Hebrews
which
figure
for
the
time
present
according
which
are
offered
both
gifts
and
sacrifices
that
cannot
touching
the
conscience
make
the
worshipper
perfect
Hebrews
being
only
with
meats
and
drinks
and
divers
washings
carnal
ordinances
imposed
until
time
reformation
Hebrews
But
Christ
having
come
high
priest
the
good
things
come
through
the
greater
and
more
perfect
tabernacle
not
made
with
hands
that
say
not
this
creation
Hebrews
nor
yet
through
the
blood
goats
and
calves
but
through
his
own
blood
entered
once
for
all
into
the
holy
place
having
obtained
eternal
redemption
Hebrews
For
the
blood
goats
and
bulls
and
the
ashes
heifer
sprinkling
them
that
have
been
defiled
sanctify
unto
the
cleanness
the
flesh
Hebrews
how
much
more
shall
the
blood
Christ
who
through
the
eternal
Spirit
offered
himself
without
blemish
unto
God
cleanse
your
conscience
from
dead
works
serve
the
living
God
Hebrews
And
for
this
cause
the
mediator
new
covenant
that
death
having
taken
place
for
the
redemption
the
transgressions
that
were
under
the
first
covenant
they
that
have
been
called
may
receive
the
promise
the
eternal
inheritance
Hebrews
For
where
testament
there
must
necessity
the
death
him
that
made
Hebrews
For
testament
force
where
there
hath
been
death
for
doth
never
avail
while
that
made
liveth
Hebrews
Wherefore
even
the
first
covenant
hath
not
been
dedicated
without
blood
Hebrews
For
when
every
commandment
had
been
spoken
Moses
unto
all
the
people
according
the
law
took
the
blood
the
calves
and
the
goats
with
water
and
scarlet
wool
and
hyssop
and
sprinkled
both
the
book
itself
and
all
the
people
Hebrews
saying
This
the
blood
the
covenant
which
God
commanded
you
ward
Hebrews
Moreover
the
tabernacle
and
all
the
vessels
the
ministry
sprinkled
like
manner
with
the
blood
Hebrews
And
according
the
law
may
almost
say
all
things
are
cleansed
with
blood
and
apart
from
shedding
blood
there
remission
Hebrews
was
necessary
therefore
that
the
copies
the
things
the
heavens
should
cleansed
with
these
but
the
heavenly
things
themselves
with
better
sacrifices
than
these
Hebrews
For
Christ
entered
not
into
holy
place
made
with
hands
like
pattern
the
true
but
into
heaven
itself
now
appear
before
the
face
God
for
Hebrews
nor
yet
that
should
offer
himself
often
the
high
priest
entereth
into
the
holy
place
year
year
with
blood
not
his
own
Hebrews
else
must
often
have
suffered
since
the
foundation
the
world
but
now
once
the
end
the
ages
hath
been
manifested
put
away
sin
the
sacrifice
himself
Hebrews
And
inasmuch
appointed
unto
men
once
die
and
after
this
cometh
judgment
Hebrews
Christ
also
having
been
once
offered
bear
the
sins
many
shall
appear
second
time
apart
from
sin
them
that
wait
for
him
unto
salvation
Hebrews
For
the
law
having
shadow
the
good
things
come
not
the
very
image
the
things
can
never
with
the
same
sacrifices
year
year
which
they
offer
continually
make
perfect
them
that
draw
nigh
Hebrews
Else
would
they
not
have
ceased
offered
because
the
worshippers
having
been
once
cleansed
would
have
had
more
consciousness
sins
Hebrews
But
those
sacrifices
there
remembrance
made
sins
year
year
Hebrews
For
impossible
that
the
blood
bulls
and
goats
should
take
away
sins
Hebrews
Wherefore
when
cometh
into
the
world
saith
Sacrifice
and
offering
thou
wouldest
not
But
body
didst
thou
prepare
for
Hebrews
whole
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
for
sin
thou
hadst
pleasure
Hebrews
Then
said
come
the
roll
the
book
written
thy
will
God
Hebrews
Saying
above
Sacrifices
and
offerings
and
whole
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
for
sin
thou
wouldest
not
neither
hadst
pleasure
therein
the
which
are
offered
according
the
law
Hebrews
then
hath
said
come
thy
will
taketh
away
the
first
that
may
establish
the
second
Hebrews
which
will
have
been
sanctified
through
the
offering
the
body
Jesus
Christ
once
for
all
Hebrews
And
every
priest
indeed
standeth
day
day
ministering
and
offering
oftentimes
the
same
sacrifices
the
which
can
never
take
away
sins
Hebrews
but
when
had
offered
one
sacrifice
for
sins
for
ever
sat
down
the
right
hand
God
Hebrews
henceforth
expecting
till
his
enemies
made
the
footstool
his
feet
Hebrews
For
one
offering
hath
perfected
for
ever
them
that
are
sanctified
Hebrews
And
the
Holy
Spirit
also
beareth
witness
for
after
hath
said
Hebrews
This
the
covenant
that
will
make
with
them
After
those
days
saith
the
Lord
will
put
laws
their
heart
And
upon
their
mind
also
will
write
them
then
saith
Hebrews
And
their
sins
and
their
iniquities
will
remember
more
Hebrews
Now
where
remission
these
there
more
offering
for
sin
Hebrews
Having
therefore
brethren
boldness
enter
into
the
holy
place
the
blood
Jesus
Hebrews
the
way
which
dedicated
for
new
and
living
way
through
the
veil
that
say
his
flesh
Hebrews
and
having
great
priest
over
the
house
God
Hebrews
let
draw
near
with
true
heart
fulness
faith
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
from
evil
conscience
and
having
our
body
washed
with
pure
water
Hebrews
let
hold
fast
the
confession
our
hope
that
waver
not
for
faithful
that
promised
Hebrews
and
let
consider
one
another
provoke
unto
love
and
good
works
Hebrews
not
forsaking
our
own
assembling
together
the
custom
some
but
exhorting
one
another
and
much
the
more
see
the
day
drawing
nigh
Hebrews
For
sin
wilfully
after
that
have
received
the
knowledge
the
truth
there
remaineth
more
sacrifice
for
sins
Hebrews
but
certain
fearful
expectation
judgment
and
fierceness
fire
which
shall
devour
the
adversaries
Hebrews
man
that
hath
set
nought
Moses
law
dieth
without

how

Thou

For

God
that

Servants

For

suffering
wrongfully
Peter
For
what
glory
when

are
buffeted

but
when
well
and
suffer
for
shall
take
patiently
this
acceptable

Peter
For
hereunto
were
called
because
Christ
also
suffered
for
you
leaving
you
example
that
should
follow
his
steps
Peter
who
did
sin
neither
was
guile
found
his

Peter
who
when
was
reviled
reviled
not
again
when
suffered
threatened
not
but
committed
himself
him
that
judgeth
righteously
Peter
who
his

self
bare
our
sins
his

upon
the
tree
that
having
died
unto
sins
might
live
unto
righteousness
whose
stripes
were
healed
Peter
For
were
going
astray
like
sheep
but
are
now
returned
unto
the
Shepherd
and
Bishop
your
souls
Peter
like
manner
wives
subjection
your
own
husbands
that
even
any
obey
not
the

they
may
without
the
word
gained
the
behavior
their
wives
Peter
beholding
your
chaste
behavior
coupled
with
fear
Peter
Whose
adorning
let
not
the
outward
adorning
braiding
the
hair
and
wearing
jewels
gold
putting
apparel
Peter
but
let
the
hidden
man
the
heart
the
incorruptible
apparel
meek
and
quiet
spirit
which
the
sight
God
great
price
Peter
For
after
this
manner
aforetime
the
holy
women
also
who
hoped
God
adorned
themselves
being
subjection
their
own
husbands
Peter
Sarah
obeyed
Abraham
calling
him
lord
whose
children
now
are
well
and
are
not
put

any

Peter
husbands
like
manner
dwell
with
your
wives
according
knowledge
giving
honor
unto
the
woman
unto
the
weaker
vessel
being
also
joint
heirs
the

life
the
end
that
your

not
hindered
Peter
Finally
all
likeminded
compassionate
loving
brethren
tenderhearted
humbleminded
Peter
not
rendering
evil

evil
reviling
for

but
contrariwise
blessing

hereunto
were
called
that

inherit
blessing
Peter
For
that
would
love
life
And
see
good
days
Let
him
refrain
his
tongue
from
evil
And
his
lips
that
they
speak
guile
Peter
And
let
him
turn
away
from
evil
and
good
Let
him
seek
peace
and
pursue
Peter
For
the
eyes
the
Lord
are
upon
the
righteous
And
his
ears
unto
their
supplication
But
the
face
the
Lord
upon
them
that
evil
Peter
And
who
that
will
harm
you
zealous
that
which
good
Peter
But
even
should
suffer
for
righteousness
sake
blessed
are
and
fear
not
their
fear
neither
troubled
Peter
but
sanctify
your
hearts
Christ
Lord
being
ready
always
give
answer
every
man
that
asketh
you
reason
concerning
the
hope
that
you
yet
with
meekness
and
fear
Peter
having
good
conscience
that
wherein
are
spoken
against
they
may
put
shame
who
revile
your
good
manner
life
Christ
Peter
For
better
the
will
God
should
will
that
suffer
for
well
doing
than
for
evil
doing
Peter
Because
Christ
also
suffered
for
sins
once
the
righteous
for
the
unrighteous
that
might
bring
God
being
put
death
the
flesh
but
made
alive
the
spirit
Peter
which
also
went
and
preached
unto
the
spirits
prison
Peter
that
aforetime
were
disobedient
when
the
longsuffering
God
waited
the
days
Noah
while
the
ark
was
preparing
wherein
few
that
eight
souls
were
saved
through
water
Peter
which
also
after
true
likeness
doth
now
save
you
even
baptism
not
the
putting
away
the
filth
the
flesh
but
the
interrogation
good
conscience
toward
God
through
the
resurrection
Jesus
Christ
Peter
who
the
right
hand
God
having
gone
into

our

Peter
Grace

multiplied
the

our
Lord
Peter
seeing
that
his

hath
granted
unto
all
things
that
pertain
unto
life
and
godliness
through
the
knowledge
him
that
called
his

glory
and
virtue
Peter
whereby
hath
granted
unto
his
precious
and
exceeding
great
promises
that
through
these
may
become
partakers
the
divine
nature
having
escaped
from
the
corruption
that
the

lust
Peter
Yea
and
for
this
very
cause
adding

and
your

Peter
For
these
things
are
yours
and
abound
they
make
you
not
idle
nor
unfruitful
unto
the
knowledge
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
Peter
For
that
lacketh
these
things
blind
seeing
only
what
near
having
forgotten
the
cleansing
from
his
old
sins
Peter
Wherefore
brethren
give
the
more
diligence
make
your
calling
and
election
sure
for
these
things
shall
never
stumble
Peter
for
thus
shall
richly
supplied
unto
you
the
entrance
into
the
eternal
kingdom
our
Lord
and
Saviour
Jesus
Christ
Peter
Wherefore
shall
ready
always
put
you
remembrance
these
things
though
know
them
and
are
established
the
truth
which
with
you
Peter
And
think
right
long
this
tabernacle
stir
you
putting
you
remembrance
Peter
knowing
that
the
putting
off
tabernacle
cometh
swiftly
even
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
signified
unto
Peter
Yea
will
give
diligence
that
every
time
may
able
after
decease
call
these
things
remembrance
Peter
For
did
not
follow
cunningly
devised
fables
when
made
known
unto
you
the
power
and
coming
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
but
were
eyewitnesses
his
majesty
Peter
For
received
from
God
the
Father
honor
and
glory
when
there
was
borne
such
voice
him
the
Majestic
Glory
This
beloved
Son
whom
well
pleased
Peter
and
this
voice
ourselves
heard
borne
out
heaven
when
were
with
him
the
holy
mount
Peter
And
have
the
word
prophecy
made
more
sure
whereunto
well
that
take
heed
unto
lamp
shining
dark
place
until
the
day
dawn
and
the
day
star
arise
your
hearts
Peter
knowing
this
first
that
prophecy
scripture
private
interpretation
Peter
For
prophecy
ever
came
the
will
man
but
men
spake
from
God
being
moved
the
Holy
Spirit
Peter
But
there
arose
false
prophets
also
among
the
people
among
you
also
there
shall
false
teachers
who
shall
privily
bring
destructive
heresies
denying
even
the
Master
that
bought
them
bringing
upon
themselves
swift
destruction
Peter
And
many
shall
follow
their
lascivious
doings
reason
whom
the
way
the
truth
shall
evil
spoken
Peter
And
covetousness
shall
they
with
feigned
words
make
merchandise
you
whose
sentence
now
from
old
lingereth
not
and
their
destruction
slumbereth
not
Peter
For
God
spared
not
angels
when
they
sinned
but
cast
them
down
hell
and
committed
them
pits
darkness
reserved
unto
judgment
Peter
and
spared
not
the
ancient
world
but
preserved
Noah
with
seven
others
preacher
righteousness
when
brought
flood
upon
the
world
the
ungodly
Peter
and
turning
the
cities
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
into
ashes
condemned
them
with
overthrow
having
made
them
example
unto
those
that
should
live
ungodly
Peter
and
delivered
righteous
Lot
sore
distressed
the
lascivious
life
the
wicked
Peter
for
that
righteous
man
dwelling
among
them
seeing
and
hearing
vexed
his
righteous
soul
from
day
day
with
their
lawless
deeds
Peter
the
Lord
knoweth
how
deliver
the
godly
out
temptation
and
keep
the
unrighteous
under
punishment
unto
the
day
judgment
Peter
but
chiefly
them
that
walk
after
the
flesh
the
lust
defilement
and
despise
dominion
Daring
self
willed
they
tremble
not
rail
dignities
Peter
whereas
angels
though
greater
might
and
power
bring
not
railing
judgment
against
them
before
the
Lord
Peter
But
these
creatures
without
reason
born
mere
animals
taken
and
destroyed
railing
matters
whereof
they
are
ignorant
shall
their
destroying
surely
destroyed
Peter
suffering
wrong
the
hire
wrong
doing
men
that
count
pleasure
revel
the
day
time
spots
and
blemishes
revelling
their
deceivings
while
they
feast
with
you
Peter
having
eyes
full
adultery
and
that
cannot
cease
from
sin
enticing
unstedfast
souls
having
heart
exercised
covetousness
children
cursing
Peter
forsaking
the
right
way
they
went
astray
having
followed
the
way
Balaam
the
son
Beor
who
loved
the
hire
wrong
doing
Peter
but
was
rebuked
for
his
own
transgression
dumb
ass
spake
with
man
voice
and
stayed
the
madness
the
prophet
Peter
These
are
springs
without
water
and
mists
driven
storm
for
whom
the
blackness
darkness
hath
been
reserved
Peter
For
uttering
great
swelling
words
vanity
they
entice
the
lusts
the
flesh
lasciviousness
those
who
are
just
escaping
from
them
that
live
error
Peter
promising
them
liberty
while
they
themselves
are
bondservants
corruption
for
whom
man
overcome
the
same
also
brought
into
bondage
Peter
For
after
they
have
escaped
the
defilements
the
world
through
the
knowledge
the
Lord
and
Saviour
Jesus
Christ
they
are
again
entangled
therein
and
overcome
the
last
state
become
worse
with
them
than
the
first
Peter
For
were
better
for
them
not
have
known
the
way
righteousness
than
after
knowing
turn
back
from
the
holy
commandment
delivered
unto
them
Peter
has
happened
unto
them
according
the
true
proverb
The
dog
turning
his
own
vomit
again
and
the
sow
that
had
washed
wallowing
the
mire
Peter
This
now
beloved
the
second
epistle
that
write
unto
you
and
both
them
stir
your
sincere
mind
putting
you
remembrance
Peter
that
should
remember
the
words
which
were
spoken
before
the
holy
prophets
and
the
commandment
the
Lord
and
Saviour
through
your
apostles
Peter
knowing
this
first
that
the
last
days
mockers
shall
come
with
mockery
walking
after
their
own
lusts
Peter
and
saying
Where
the
promise
his
coming
for
from
the
day
that
the
fathers
fell
asleep
all
things
continue
they
were
from
the
beginning
the
creation
Peter
For
this
they
wilfully
forget
that
there
were
heavens
from
old
and
earth
compacted
out
water
and
amidst
water
the
word
God
Peter
which
means
the
world
that
then
was
being
overflowed
with
water
perished
Peter
but
the
heavens
that
now
are
and
the
earth
the
same
word
have
been
stored
for
fire
being
reserved
against
the
day
judgment
and
destruction
ungodly
men
Peter
But
forget
not
this
one
thing
beloved
that
one
day
with
the
Lord
thousand
years
and
thousand
years
one
day
Peter
The
Lord
not
slack
concerning
his
promise
some
count
slackness
but
longsuffering
you
ward
not
wishing
that
any
should
perish
but
that
all
should
come
repentance
Peter
But
the
day
the
Lord
will
come
thief
the
which
the
heavens
shall
pass
away
with
great
noise
and
the
elements
shall
dissolved
with
fervent
heat
and
the
earth
and
the
works
that
are
therein
shall
burned
Peter
Seeing
that
these
things
are
thus
all
dissolved
what
manner
persons
ought
all
holy
living
and
godliness
Peter
looking
for
and
earnestly
desiring
the
coming
the
day
God
reason
which
the
heavens
being
fire
shall
dissolved
and
the
elements
shall
melt
with
fervent
heat
Peter
But
according
his
promise
look
for
new
heavens
and
new
earth
wherein
dwelleth
righteousness
Peter
Wherefore
beloved
seeing
that
look
for
these
things
give
diligence
that
may
found
peace
without
spot
and
blameless
his
sight
Peter
And
account
that
the
longsuffering
our
Lord
salvation
even
our
beloved
brother
Paul
also
according
the
wisdom
given
him
wrote
unto
you
Peter
also
all
his
epistles
speaking
them
these
things
wherein
are
some
things
hard
understood
which
the
ignorant
and
unstedfast
wrest
they
also
the
other
scriptures
unto
their
own
destruction
Peter
therefore
beloved
knowing
these
things
beforehand
beware
lest
being
carried
away
with
the
error
the
wicked
fall
from
your
own
stedfastness
Peter
But
grow
the
grace
and
knowledge
our
Lord
and
Saviour
Jesus
Christ
him
the
glory
both
now
and
for
ever
Amen

Again
new

now
John
that
loveth
his

But
that
hateth
his

Little

have
there
arisen
many
antichrists
whereby
know
that
the
last
hour
John
They
went
out
from

they
were
not
for
they
had
been
they
would
have

they
went
out
that
they
might
made
manifest
that
they
all
are
not

And
have
anointing
from
the
Holy
One
and

John
have

Who

This

Whosoever

These

John
who

before
the

whom
thou

John
because
that

therefore

John
wrote
somewhat
unto
the

but
Diotrephes
who

Therefore

and
not
content
therewith
neither
doth

Mercy
unto

multiplied
Jude
Beloved
while
was
giving
all
diligence
write
unto
you
our
common
salvation
was
constrained
write
unto
you
exhorting
you
contend
earnestly
for
the
faith
which
was
once
for
all
delivered
unto
the
saints
Jude
For
there
are
certain
men
crept
privily
even
they
who
were
old
written
beforehand
unto
this
condemnation
ungodly
men
turning
the
grace
our
God
into
lasciviousness
and
denying
our
only
Master
and
Lord
Jesus
Christ
Jude
Now
desire
put
you
remembrance
though
know
all
things
once
for
all
that
the
Lord
having
saved
people
out
the
land
Egypt
afterward
destroyed
them
that
believed
not
Jude
And
angels
that
kept
not
their
own
principality
but
left
their
proper
habitation
hath
kept
everlasting
bonds
under
darkness
unto
the
judgment
the
great
day
Jude
Even
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
and
the
cities
about
them
having
like
manner
with
these
given
themselves
over
fornication
and
gone
after
strange
flesh
are
set
forth
example
suffering
the
punishment
eternal
fire
Jude
Yet
like
manner
these
also
their
dreamings
defile
the
flesh
and
set
nought
dominion
and
rail
dignities
Jude
But
Michael
the
archangel
when
contending
with
the
devil
disputed
about
the
body
Moses
durst
not
bring
against
him
railing
judgment
but
said
The
Lord
rebuke
thee
Jude
But
these
rail
whatsoever
things
they
know
not
and
what
they
understand
naturally
like
the
creatures
without
reason
these
things
are
they
destroyed
Jude
Woe
unto
them
for
they
went
the
way
Cain
and
ran
riotously
the
error
Balaam
for
hire
and
perished
the
gainsaying
Korah
Jude
These
are
they
who
are
hidden
rocks
your

feasts
when
they
feast
with
you
shepherds
that
without
fear
feed
themselves
clouds
without
water
carried
along
winds
autumn
trees
without

twice
dead
plucked
the

Jude
wild
waves
the
sea
foaming
out
their
own
shame
wandering
stars
for
whom
the
blackness
darkness
hath
been
reserved
for

And
these
also
Enoch
the
seventh
from
Adam
prophesied
saying
Behold
the
Lord
came
with
ten
thousands
his
holy
ones
Jude
execute
judgment
upon
all
and
convict
all
the
ungodly
all
their
works
ungodliness
which
they
have
ungodly
wrought
and
all
the
hard
things
which
ungodly
sinners
have
spoken
against
him
Jude
These
are
murmurers
complainers
walking
after
their
lusts
and
their
mouth
speaketh
great
swelling
words
showing
respect
persons
for
the
sake
advantage
Jude
But
beloved
remember
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
before
the
apostles
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
Jude
that
they
said
you
the
last
time
there
shall
mockers
walking
after
their
own
ungodly
lusts
Jude
These
are
they
who
make
separations
sensual
having
not
the
Spirit
Jude
But
beloved
building
yourselves
your
most
holy
faith
praying
the
Holy
Spirit
Jude
keep
yourselves
the
love
God
looking
for
the
mercy
our
Lord
Jesus

unto
eternal
life
Jude
And
some
have
mercy
who
are

Jude
and
some
save
snatching
them
out
the
fire
and
some
have
mercy
with
fear
hating
even
the

Now
