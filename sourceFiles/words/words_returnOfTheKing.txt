both
the
understanding
and
the
appreciation
serious
readers
and
Tolkien
had
many
such
readers
from
very
early
Even
before
the
publication
the
third
volume
which
contained
much
hitherto
unrevealed
information
the
invented
languages
and
writing
systems
Tolkien
received
many
letters
from
readers
written

systems

numerous
enquiries

contain
much
etymological
information
the

ticularly
the

proved
the
chief
cause
the
delay
publishing
volume
three
which
the
end
contained

all
only
apology
from
the
publisher
for
its
absence
For
Tolkien
had
abandoned
work
after
indexing
vol
umes

and
two
believing
its
size
and
therefore
its
cost
ruinous
Volume

The
Return

finally
appeared

October
1955
and

With

FOREWORD

This

glimpses

yet
more
ancient
history

Some
who

found
boring
absurd
contemptible
and
have
cause
complain
since
have

The

down

and
The

THE

The
crucial
chapter
The
Shadow
the
Past
one
the
oldest
parts
the
tale
was
written
long
before
the
foreshadow
1939
had
yet
become
threat
inevitable
disaster
and
from
that
point
the
story
would
have
developed
along
essentially
the
same
lines
that
disaster
had
been
averted
Its
sources
are
things
long
before
mind
some
cases
already
written
and
little
nothing
was
modified
the
war
that
began
1939
its
sequels
The
real
war
does
not
resemble
the
legendary
war
its
process
its
conclusion
had
inspired
directed
the
development
the
legend
then
certainly
the
Ring
would
have
been
seized
and
used
against
Sauron
would
not
have
been
annihilated
but
slaved
and
Barad
dir
would
not
have
been
destroyed
but
occupied
Saruman
failing
get
possession
the
Ring
would
the
confusion
and
treacheries
the
time
have
found
Mordor
the
missing
links
his
own
researches
into
Ring
lore
and
before
long
would
have
made
Great

challenge

Middle

that
conflict

Other

all
the
Hobbits
the
great
events
that
Age
that
are
here
related
Many
however
may
wish
know
more
about
this
remarkable
people
from
the
outset
while
some
may
not
possess
the
earlier
book
For
such
readers
few
notes
the
more
important
points
are
here
collected
from
Hobbit
lore
and
the
first
adventure
briefly
recalled
Hobbits
are
unobtrusive
but
very
ancient
people
more
numer
ous
formerly
than
they
are
today
for
they
love
peace
and
quiet
and
good
tilled
earth
well
ordered
and
well
farmed
countryside
was
their
favourite
haunt
They
not
and
did
not
understand
like
machines
more
complicated
than
forge
bellows
water
mill
hand
loom
though
they
were
skilful
with
tools
Even
ancient
days
they
were
rule
shy
the
Big
Folk
they
call
and
now
they
avoid
with
dismay
and
are
becoming
hard
find
They
are
quick
hearing
and
sharp
eyed
and
though
they
are
inclined
fat
and
not
hurry
unnecessarily
they
are
nonetheless
nimble
and
deft
their
movements
They
possessed
from
the
first
the
art
disappearing
swiftly
and
silently
when
large
folk
whom
they
not
wish
meet
come
blundering
and
this
art
they
have
developed
until
Men
may
seem
magical
But
Hobbits
have
never
fact
studied
magic
any
kind
and
their
elusiveness
due
solely
professional
skill
that
heredity
and
practice
and
close
friendship
with
the
earth
have
rendered
inimitable
bigger
and
clumsier
races
For
they
are
little
people
smaller
than
Dwarves
less
stout
and
stocky
that
even
when
they
are
not
actually
much
shorter
Their
height
variable
ranging
between
two
and
four
feet
our
measure
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
They
seldom
now
reach
three
feet
but
they
have
dwindled
they
say
and
ancient
days
they
were
taller
According
the
Red
Book
Bandobras
Took
Bullroarer
son
Isumbras
the
Third
was
four
foot
five
and
able
ride
horse
was
surpassed
all
Hobbit
records
only
two
famous
characters
old
but
that
curious
matter
dealt
with
this
book
for
the
Hobbits
the
Shire
with
whom
these
tales
are
con
cerned
the
days
their
peace
and
prosperity
they
were
merry
folk
They
dressed
bright
colours
being
notably
fond
yellow
and
green
but
they
seldom
wore
shoes
since
their
feet
had
tough
leathery
soles
and
were
clad
thick
curling
hair
much
like
the
hair
their
heads
which
was
commonly
brown
Thus
the
only
craft
little
practised
among
them
was
shoe
making
but
they
had
long
and
skilful
fingers
and
could
make
many
other
useful
and
comely
things
Their
faces
were
rule
good
natured
rather
than
beautiful
broad
bright
eyed
red
cheeked
with
mouths
apt
laughter
and
eating
and
drinking
And
laugh
they
did
and
eat
and
drink
often
and
heartily
being
fond
simple
jests
all
times
and
six
meals
day
when
they
could
get
them
They
were
hospitable
and
delighted
parties
and
presents
which
they
gave
away
freely
and
eagerly
accepted
plain
indeed
that
spite
later
estrangement
Hobbits
are
relatives
ours
far
nearer
than
Elves
even
than
Dwarves
old
they
spoke
the
languages
Men
after
their
own
fashion
and
liked
and
disliked
much
the
same
things
Men
did
But
what
exactly
our
relationship
can
longer
discovered
The
beginning
Hobbits
lies
far
back
the
Elder
Days
that
are
now
lost
and
forgotten
Only
the
Elves
still
preserve
any
records
that
vanished
time
and
their
traditions
are
concerned
almost
entirely
with
their
own
history
which
Men
appear
seldom
and
Hobbits
are
not
mentioned
all
Yet
clear
that
Hobbits
had
fact
lived
quietly
Middle
earth
for
many
long
years
before
other
folk
became
even
aware
them
And
the
world
being
after
all
full
strange
creatures
beyond
count
these
little
people
seemed
very
little
importance
But
the
days
Bilbo
and
Frodo
his
heir
they
suddenly
became
wish
their
own
both
important
and
renowned
and
troubled
the
counsels
the
Wise
and
the
Great
Those
days
the
Third
Age
Middle
earth
are
now
long
past
and
the
shape
all
lands
has
been
changed
but
the
regions
which
Hobbits
then
lived
were
doubtless
the
same
those
which
they
still
linger
the
North
West
the
Old
World
east
the
Sea
their
original
home
the
Hobbits
Bilbo
time
preserved
knowledge
love
learning
other
than
genealogical
lore
was
far
from
general
PROLOGUE
among
them
but
there
remained
still
few
the
older
families
who
studied
their
own
books
and
even
gathered
reports
old
times
and
distant
lands
from
Elves
Dwarves
and
Men
Their
own
records
began
only
after
the
settlement
the
Shire
and
their
most
ancient
legends
hardly
looked
further
back
than
their
Wandering
Days
clear
nonetheless
from
these
legends
and
from
the
evidence
their
peculiar
words
and
customs
that
like
many
other
folk
Hobbits
had
the
distant
past
moved
westward
Their
earliest
tales
seem
glimpse
time
when
they
dwelt
the
upper
vales
Anduin
between
the
eaves
Greenwood
the
Great
and
the
Misty
Mountains
Why
they
later
undertook
the
hard
and
perilous
crossing
the
mountains
into
Eriador
longer
certain
Their
own
accounts
speak
the
multiplying
Men
the
land
and
shadow
that
fell
the
forest
that
became
darkened
and
its
new
name
was
Mirkwood
Before
the
crossing
the
mountains
the
Hobbits
had
already
become
divided
into
three
somewhat
different
breeds
Harfoots
Stoors
and
Fallohides
The
Harfoots
were
browner
skin
smaller
and
shorter
and
they
were
beardless
and
bootless
their
hands
and
feet
were
neat
and
nimble
and
they
preferred
highlands
and
hillsides
The
Stoors
were
broader
heavier
build
their
feet
and
hands
were
larger
and
they
preferred
flat
lands
and
riversides
The
Fallohides
were
fairer
skin
and
also
hair
and
they
were
taller
and
slimmer
than
the
others
they
were
lovers
trees
and
woodlands
The
Harfoots
had
much
with
Dwarves
ancient
times
and
long
lived
the
foothills
the
mountains
They
moved
westward
early
and
roamed
over
Eriador
far
Weathertop
while
the
others
were
still
Wilderland
They
were
the
most
normal
and
repre
sentative
variety
Hobbit
and
far
the
most
numerous
They
were
the
most
inclined
settle
one
place
and
longest
preserved
their
ancestral
habit
living
tunnels
and
holes
The
Stoors
lingered
long
the
banks
the
Great
River
Anduin
and
were
less
shy
Men
They
came
west
after
the
Harfoots
and
followed
the
course
the
Loudwater
southwards
and
there
many
them
long
dwelt
between
Tharbad
and
the
borders
Dunland
before
they
moved
north
again
The
Fallohides
the
least
numerous
were
northerly
branch
They
were
more
friendly
with
Elves
than
the
other
Hobbits
were
and
had
more
skill
language
and
song
than
handicrafts
and
old
they
preferred
hunting
tilling
They
crossed
the
mountains
north
Rivendell
and
came
down
the
River
Hoarwell
Eriador
they
soon
mingled
with
the
other
kinds
that
had
preceded
them
but
being
somewhat
bolder
and
more
adventurous
they
were
often
found
leaders
chieftains
among
clans
Harfoots
Stoors
Even
Bilbo
time
the
strong
Fallohidish
strain
could
still
noted
among
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
the
greater
families
such
the
Tooks
and
the
Masters
Buckland
the
westlands
Eriador
between
the
Misty
Mountains
and
the
Mountains
Lune
the
Hobbits
found
both
Men
and
Elves
Indeed
remnant
still
dwelt
there
the
Dunedain
the
kings
Men
that
came
over
the
Sea
out
Westernesse
but
they
were
dwin
dling
fast
and
the
lands
their
North
Kingdom
were
falling
far
and
wide
into
waste
There
was
room
and
spare
for
incomers
and
ere
long
the
Hobbits
began
settle
ordered
communities
Most
their
earlier
settlements
had
long
disappeared
and
been
forgotten
Bilbo
time
but
one
the
first
become
important
still
endured
though
reduced
size
this
was
Bree
and
the
Chetwood
that
lay
round
about
some
forty
miles
east
the
Shire
was
these
early
days
doubtless
that
the
Hobbits
learned
their
letters
and
began
write
after
the
manner
the
Duinedain
who
had
their
turn
long
before
learned
the
art
from
the
Elves
And
those
days
also
they
forgot
whatever
languages
they
had
used
before
and
spoke
ever
after
the
Common
Speech
the
Westron
was
named
that
was
current
through
all
the
lands
the
kings
from
Arnor
Gondor
and
about
all
the
coasts
the
Sea
from
Belfalas
Lune
Yet
they
kept
few
words
their
own
well
their
own
names
months
and
days
and
great
store
personal
names
out
the
past
About
this
time
legend
among
the
Hobbits
first
becomes
history
with
reckoning
years
For
was
the
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
first
year
the
Third
Age
that
the
Fallohide
brothers
Marcho
and
Blanco
set
out
from
Bree
and
having
obtained
permission
from
the
high
king
Fornost
they
crossed
the
brown
river
Baranduin
with
great
following
Hobbits
They
passed
over
the
Bridge
Stonebows
that
had
been
built
the
days
the
power
the
North
Kingdom
and
they
took
all
the
land
beyond
dwell
between
the
river
and
the
Far
Downs
All
that
was
demanded
them
was
that
they
should
keep
the
Great
Bridge
repair
and
all
other
bridges
and
roads
speed
the
king
messengers
and
acknowledge
his
lordship
Thus
began
the
Shire
reckoning
for
the
year
the
crossing
the
Brandywine
the
Hobbits
turned
the
name
became
Year
One
the
Shire
and
all
later
dates
were
reckoned
from
once
the
western
Hobbits
fell
love
with
their
new
land
and
they
remained
there
and
soon
passed
once
more
out
the
history
Men
and
Elves
While
there
was
still
king
they
were
name
his
subjects
the
records
Gondor
relate
this
was
Argeleb
the
twentieth
the
Northern
line
which
came
end
with
Arvedui
three
hundred
years
later
Thus
the
years
the
Third
Age
the
reckoning
the
Elves
and
the
Dunedain
may
found
adding
1600
the
dates
Shire
reckoning
PROLOGUE
but
they
were
fact
ruled
their
own
chieftains
and
meddled
not
all
with
events
the
world
outside
the
last
battle
Fornost
with
the
Witch
lord
Angmar
they
sent
some
bowmen
the
aid
the
king
they
maintained
though
tales
Men
record
But
that
war
the
North
Kingdom
ended
and
then
the
Hobbits
took
the
land
for
their
own
and
they
chose
from
their
own
chiefs
Thain
hold
the
authority
the
king
that
was
gone
There
for
thousand
years
they
were
little
troubled
wars
and
they
prospered
and
multiplied
after
the
Dark
Plague
until
the
disaster
the
Long
Winter
and
the
famine
that
followed
Many
thousands
then
perished
but
the
Days
Dearth
1158
were
the
time
this
tale
long
past
and
the
Hobbits
had
again
become
accustomed
plenty
The
land
was
rich
and
kindly
and
though
had
long
been
deserted
when
they
entered
had
before
been
well
tilled
and
there
the
king
had
once
had
many
farms
cornlands
vineyards
and
woods
Forty
leagues
stretched
from
the
Far
Downs
the
Brandywine
Bridge
and
fifty
from
the
northern
moors
the
marshes
the
south
The
Hobbits
named
the
Shire
the
region
the
authority
their
Thain
and
district
well
ordered
business
and
there
that
pleasant
corner
the
world
they
plied
their
well
ordered
business
living
and
they
heeded
less
and
less
the
world
outside
where
dark
things
moved
until
they
came
think
that
peace
and
plenty
were
the
rule
Middle
earth
and
the
right
all
sensible
folk
They
forgot
ignored
what
little
they
had
ever
known
the
Guardians
and
the
labours
those
that
made
possible
the
long
peace
the
Shire
They
were
fact
sheltered
but
they
had
ceased
remember
time
had
Hobbits
any
kind
been
warlike
and
they
had
never
fought
among
themselves
olden
days
they
had
course
been
often
obliged
fight
maintain
themselves
hard
world
but
Bilbo
time
that
was
very
ancient
history
The
last
battle
before
this
story
opens
and
indeed
the
only
one
that
had
ever
been
fought
within
the
borders
the
Shire
was
beyond
living
memory
the
Battle
Greenfields
1147
which
Bandobras
Took
routed
invasion
Orcs
Even
the
weathers
had
grown
milder
and
the
wolves
that
had
once
come
ravening
out
the
North
bitter
white
winters
were
now
only
grandfather
tale
though
there
was
still
some
store
weapons
the
Shire
these
were
used
mostly
trophies
hanging
above
hearths
walls
gathered
into
the
museum
Michel
Delving
The
Mathom
house
was
called
for
anything
that
Hobbits
had
immediate
use
for
but
were
unwilling
throw
away
they
called
mathom
Their
dwellings
were
apt
become
rather
crowded
with
mathoms
and
many
the
presents
that
passed
from
hand
hand
were
that
sort
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Nonetheless
ease
and
peace
had
left
this
people
still
curiously
tough
They
were
came
difficult
daunt
kill
and
they
were
perhaps
unwearyingly
fond
good
things
not
least
because
they
could
when
put
without
them
and
could
survive
rough
handling
grief
foe
weather
way
that
aston
ished
those
who
did
not
know
them
well
and
looked
further
than
their
bellies
and
their
well
fed
faces
Though
slow
quarrel
and
for
sport
killing
nothing
that
lived
they
were
doughty
bay
and
need
could
still
handle
arms
They
shot
well
with
the
bow
for
they
were
keen
eyed
and
sure
the
mark
Not
only
with
bows
and
arrows
any
Hobbit
stooped
for
stone
was
well
get
quickly
under
cover
all
trespassing
beasts
knew
very
well
All
Hobbits
had
originally
lived
holes
the
ground
they
believed
and
such
dwellings
they
still
felt
most
home
but
the
course
time
they
had
been
obliged
adopt
other
forms
abode
Actually
the
Shire
Bilbo
days
was
rule
only
the
richest
and
the
poorest
Hobbits
that
maintained
the
old
custom
The
poorest
went
living
burrows
the
most
primitive
kind
mere
holes
indeed
with
only
one
window
none
while
the
well
still
constructed
more
luxurious
versions
the
simple
diggings
old
But
suitable
sites
for
these
large
and
ramifying
tunnels
smials
they
called
them
were
not
everywhere
found
and
the
flats
and
the
low
lying
districts
the
Hobbits
they
multiplied
began
build
above
ground
Indeed
even
the
hilly
regions
and
the
older
villages
such
Hobbiton
Tuckborough
the
chief
township
the
Shire
Michel
Delving
the
White
Downs
there
were
now
many
houses
wood
brick
stone
These
were
specially
favoured
millers
smiths
ropers
and
cartwrights
and
others
that
sort
for
even
when
they
had
holes
live
Hobbits
had
long
been
accustomed
build
sheds
and
workshops
The
habit
building
farmhouses
and
barns
was
said
have
begun
among
the
inhabitants
the
Marish
down
the
Brandywine
The
Hobbits
that
quarter
the
Eastfarthing
were
rather
large
and
heavy
legged
and
they
wore
dwarf
boots
muddy
weather
But
they
were
well
known
Stoors
large
part
their
blood
indeed
was
shown
the
down
that
many
grew
their
chins
Harfoot
Fallohide
had
any
trace
beard
Indeed
the
folk
the
Marish
and
Buckland
east
the
River
which
they
afterwards
occupied
came
for
the
most
part
later
into
the
Shire
from
south
away
and
they
still
had
many
peculiar
names
and
strange
words
not
found
elsewhere
the
Shire
probable
that
the
craft
building
many
other
crafts
beside
was
derived
from
the
Dunedain
But
the
Hobbits
may
have
learned
direct
from
the
Elves
the
teachers
Men
their
youth
For
the
PROLOGUE
Elves
the
High
Kindred
had
not
yet
forsaken
Middle
earth
and
they
dwelt
still
that
time
the
Grey
Havens
away
the
west
and
other
places
within
reach
the
Shire
Three
Elf
towers
immemorial
age
were
still
seen
the
Tower
Hills
beyond
the
western
marches
They
shone
far
off
the
moonlight
The
tallest
was
furthest
away
standing
alone
upon
green
mound
The
Hobbits
the
Westfarthing
said
that
one
could
see
the
Sea
from
the
top
that
tower
but
Hobbit
had
ever
been
known
climb
Indeed
few
Hobbits
had
ever
seen
sailed
upon
the
Sea
and
fewer
still
had
ever
returned
report
Most
Hobbits
regarded
even
rivers
and
small
boats
with
deep
misgivings
and
not
many
them
could
swim
And
the
days
the
Shire
lengthened
they
spoke
less
and
less
with
the
Elves
and
grew
afraid
them
and
distrustful
those
that
had
dealings
with
them
and
the
Sea
became
word
fear
among
them
and
token
death
and
they
turned
their
faces
away
from
the
hills
the
west
The
craft
building
may
have
come
from
Elves
Men
but
the
Hobbits
used
their
own
fashion
They
did
not
for
towers
Their
houses
were
usually
long
low
and
comfortable
The
oldest
kind
were
indeed
more
than
built
imitations
smials
thatched
with
dry
grass
straw
roofed
with
turves
and
having
walls
some
what
bulged
That

The

Shire
hobbits
were
often
large
and
inhabited
large
families
Bilbo
and
Frodo
Baggins
were

All
Hobbits
were
any
case
clannish
and
reckoned
their
relationships
with
great
care
They
drew
long
and
elaborate
family
trees
with
innumerable
branches

Hobbits

The

THE
LORD

Concerning
Pipe
weed
There
another
astonishing
thing
about
Hobbits
old
that
must
mentioned
astonishing
habit
they
imbibed
inhaled
through
pipes
clay
wood
the
smoke
the
burning
leaves
herb
which
they
called
pipe
weed
leaf
variety
probably
Nicotiana
great
deal
mystery
surrounds
the
origin
this
peculiar
custom
art
the
Hobbits
preferred
call
All
that
could
discovered
about
antiquity
was
put
together
Meriadoc
Brandybuck
later
Master
Buckland
and
since
and
the
tobacco
the
Southfarth
ing
play
part
the
history
that
follows
his
remarks
the
introduc
tion
his
Herblore
the
Shire
may
quoted
This
says
the
one
art
that
can
certainly
claim
our
own
invention
When
Hobbits
first
began
smoke
not
known
all
the
legends
and
family
histories
take
for
granted
for
ages
folk
the
Shire
smoked
various
herbs
some
fouler
some
sweeter
But
all
accounts
agree
that
Tobold
Hornblower
Longbottom
the
Southfarthing
first
grew
the
true
pipe
weed
his
gardens
the
days
Isengrim
the
Second
about
the
year
1070
Shire
reckoning
The
best
home
grown
still
comes
from
that
district
especially
the
varieties
now
known
Longbottom
Leaf
Old
Toby
and
Southern
Star
How
Old
Toby
came
the
plant
not
recorded
for
his
dying
day
would
not
tell
knew
much
about
herbs
but
was
traveller
said
that
his
youth
went
often
Bree
though
certainly
never
went
further
from
the
Shire
than
that
thus
quite
possible
that
learned
this
plant
Bree
where
now
any
rate
grows
well
the
south
slopes
the
hill
The
Bree
hobbits
claim
have
been
the
first
actual
smokers
the
pipe
weed
They
claim
course
have
done
everything
before
the
people
the
Shire
whom
they
refer
colonists
but
this
case
their
claim
think
likely
true
And
certainly
was
from
Bree
that
the
art
smoking
the
genuine
weed
spread
the
recent
centuries
among
Dwarves
and
such
other
folk
Rangers
Wizards
wanderers
still
passed

fro
through
that
ancient
road
meeting
The

and

art
thus
found
the
old
inn
Bree
The
Prancing
Pony
that
has
been
kept
the
family
Butterbur
from
time
beyond
record
All
the
same
observations
that
have
made
own
many
journeys
south
have
convinced
that
the
weed
itself
not
native
our
parts
the
world
but
came
northward
from
the
lower
Anduin
whither
was
suspect
originally
brought
over

From

But

credit
Hobbits
first
put
into

Not
even
the
Wizards
first
thought
that

that
knew
took
the
art
long
ago
and
became
skilful
all
other
things
that
put
his
mind
the
Ordering
the
Shire
The
Shire
was
divided
into
four
quarters
the
Farthings
already
referred
North
South
East
and
West
and
these
again
each
into
number
folklands
which
still
bore
the
names
some
the
old
leading
families
although
the
time
this
history
these
names
were
longer
found
only
their
proper
folklands
Nearly
all
Tooks
still
lived
the
Tookland
but
that
was
not
true
many
other
families
such
the
Bagginses
the
Boffins
Outside
the
Farthings
were
the
East
and
West
Marches
the
Buckland
and
the
Westmarch
added
the
Shire
1452
The
Shire
this
time
had
hardly
any
government
Families
for
the
most
part
managed
their
own
affairs
Growing
food
and
eating
occupied
most
their
time
other
matters
they
were
rule
generous
and
not
greedy
but
contented
and
moderate
that
estates
farms
workshops
and
small
trades
tended
remain
unchanged
for
generations
There
remained
course
the
ancient
tradition
concerning
the
high
king
Fornost
Norbury
they
called
away
north
the
Shire
But
there
had
been
king
for
nearly
thousand
years
and
even
the
ruins
Kings
Norbury
were
covered
with
grass
Yet
the
Hobbits
still
said
wild
folk
and
wicked
things
such
trolls
that
they
had
not
heard
the
king
For
they
attributed
the
king
old
all
their
essential
laws
and
usually
they
kept
the
laws
free
will
because
they
were
The
Rules
they
said
both
ancient
and
just
true
that
the
Took
family
had
long
been
pre
eminent
for
the
office
Thain
had
passed
them
from
the
Oldbucks
some
cen
turies
before
and
the
chief
Took
had
borne
that
title
ever
since
The
Thain
was
the
master
the
Shire
moot
and
captain
the
Shire
muster
and
the
Hobbitry
arms
but
muster
and
moot
were
only
held
times
emergency
which
longer
occurred
the
Thainship
had
ceased
more
than
nominal
dignity
The
Took
family
was
still
indeed
accorded
special
respect
for
remained
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
both
numerous
and
exceedingly
wealthy
and
was
liable
produce
every
generation
strong
characters
peculiar
habits
and
even
adventurous
temperament
The
latter
qualities
however
were
now
rather
tolerated
the
rich
than
generally
approved
The
custom
endured
nonetheless
referring
the
head
the
family
The
Took
and
adding
his
name
required
number
such
Isengrim
the
Second
for
instance
The
only
real
official
the
Shire
this
date
was
the
Mayor
Michel
Delving
the
Shire
who
was
elected
every
seven
years
the
Free
Fair
the
White
Downs
the
Lithe
that
Mid
summer
mayor
almost
his
only
duty
was
preside
banquets
given
the
Shire
holidays
which
occurred
frequent
intervals
But
the
offices
Postmaster
and
First
Shirriff
were
attached
the
mayoralty
that
managed
both
the
Messenger
Service
and
the
Watch
These
were
the
only
Shire
services
and
the
Messengers
were
the
most
numerous
and
much
the
busier
the
two
means
all
Hobbits
were
lettered
but
those
who
were
wrote
constantly
all
their
friends
and
selection
their
relations
who
lived
further
off
than
afternoon
walk
The
Shirriffs
was
the
name
that
the
Hobbits
gave
their
police
the
nearest
equivalent
that
they
possessed
They
had
course
uniforms
such
things
being
quite
unknown
only
feather
their
caps
and
they
were
practice
rather
haywards
than
policemen
more
concerned
with
the
strayings
beasts
than
people

that
Outsiders
any
kind
great
small
did
not
make
themselves
nuisance
the
time
when
this
story
begins
the
Bounders
they
were
called
had
been
greatly
increased
There
were
many
reports
and
complaints
strange
persons
and
creatures
prowling
about
the
borders
over
them
the
first
sign
that
all
was
not
quite
should
and
always
had
been
except
tales
and
legends
long
ago
Few
heeded
the
sign
and
not
even
Bilbo
yet
had
any
notion
what
portended
Sixty
years
had
passed
since
set
out
his
memorable
journey
and
was
old
even
for
Hobbits
who
reached

often
not
but

evidently
still
remained

considerable
wealth
that
had
brought
back
How
much
how
little
revealed
one
not
even
Frodo
his
favourite
nephew
And
still
kept
secret
the
ring
that

and

with
him
none

than
Thorin

With

set

off

The
quest
was
successful
and
the

guarded

was
destroyed
Yet
though
before
all
was
won
the
Battle
Five

was
fought
and
Thorin
was
slain
and
many

were
done
the

later
history
earned
more
than
note
the
long
annals
the
Third
Age
but
for
accident
the
way
The
party
was
assailed
Orcs
high
pass
the
Misty
Mountains
they
went
towards
Wilderland
and
happened
that
Bilbo
was
lost
for
while
the
black
orc
mines
deep
under
the
mountains
and
there
groped
vain
the
dark
put
his
hand
ring
lying
the
floor
tunnel
put
his
pocket
seemed
then
like
mere
luck
Trying
find
his
way
out
Bilbo
went
down
the
roots
the
mountains
until
could
further
the
bottom
the
tunnel
lay
cold
lake
far
from
the
light
and
island
rock
the
water
lived
Gollum
was
loathsome
little
creature
paddled
small
boat
with
his
large
flat
feet
peering
with
pale
luminous
eyes
and
catching
blind
fish
with
his
long
fingers
and
eating
them
raw
ate
any
living
thing
even
orc
could
catch
and
strangle
without
struggle
possessed
secret
treasure
that
had
come
him
long
ages
ago
when
still
lived
the
light
ring
gold
that
made
its
wearer
invisible
was
the
one
thing
loved
his
Precious
and
talked
even
when
was
not
with
him
For
kept
hidden
safe
hole
his
island
except
when
was
hunting
spying
the
orcs
the
mines
Maybe
would
have
attacked
Bilbo
once
the
ring
had
been
him
when
they
met
but
was
not
and
the
hobbit
held
his
hand
Elvish
knife
which
served
him
sword
gain
time
Gollum
challenged
Bilbo
the
Riddle
game
saying
that
asked
riddle
which
Bilbo
could
not
guess
then
would
kill
him
and
eat
him
but
Bilbo
defeated
him
then
would
Bilbo
wished
would
lead
him
way
out
the
tunnels
Since
was
lost
the
dark
without
hope
and
could
neither
nor
back
Bilbo
accepted
the
challenge
and
they
asked
one
another
many
riddles
the
end
Bilbo
won
the
game
more
luck
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
seemed
than
wits
for
was
stumped
last
for
riddle
ask
and
cried
out
his
hand
came
upon
the
ring
had
picked
and
forgotten
What
have
got
pocket
This
Gollum
failed
answer
though
demanded
three
guesses
The
Authorities
true
differ
whether
this
last
question
was
mere
question
and
not
riddle
according
the
strict
rules
the
Game
but
all
agree
that
after
accepting
and
trying
guess
the
answer
Gollum
was
bound
his
promise
And
Bilbo
pressed
him
keep
his
word
for
the
thought
came
him
that
this
slimy
creature
might
prove
false
even
though
such
promises
were
held
sacred
and
old
all
but
the
wickedest
things
feared
break
them
But
after
ages
alone
the
dark
Gollum
heart
was
black
and
treachery
was
slipped
away
and
returned
his
island
which
Bilbo
knew
nothing
not
far
off
the
dark
water
There
thought
lay
his
ring
was
hungry
now
and
angry
and
once
his
Precious
was
with
him
would
not
fear
any
weapon
all
But
the
ring
was
not
the
island
had
lost
was
gone
His
screech
sent
shiver
down
Bilbo
back
though
did
not
yet
understand
what
had
happened
But
Gollum
had
last
leaped
guess
too
late
What
has
got
its
pocketses
cried
The
light
his
eyes
was
like
green
flame
sped
back
murder
the
hobbit
and
recover
his
Precious
Just
time
Bilbo
saw
his
peril
and
fled
blindly
the
passage
away
from
the
water
and
once
more
was
saved
his
luck
For
ran
put
his
hand
his
pocket
and
the
ring
slipped
quietly
his
finger
was
that
Gollum
passed
him
without
seeing
him
and
went
guard
the
way
out
lest
the
thief
should
escape
Warily
Bilbo
followed
him
went
along
cursing
and
talking
himself
about
his
Precious
from
which
talk
last
even
Bilbo
guessed
the
truth
and
hope
came
him
the
darkness
himself
had
found
the
marvellous
ring
and
chance
escape
from
the
orcs
and
from
Gollum
length
they
came
halt
before
unseen
opening
that
led
the
lower
gates
the
mines
the
eastward
side
the
mountains
There
Gollum
crouched
bay
smelling
and
listening
and
Bilbo
was
tempted
slay
him
with
his
sword
But
pity
stayed
him
and
though
kept
the
ring
which
his
only
hope
lay
would
not
use
help
him
kill
the
wretched
creature
disadvantage
the
end
gathering
his
courage
leaped
over
Gollum
the
dark
and
fled
away
down
the
passage
pursued
his
enemy
cries
hate
and
despair
Thief
thief
Baggins
hates
for
ever
Now
curious
fact
that
this
not
the
story
Bilbo
first
told
his
companions
them
his
account
was
that
Gollum
had
promised
give
him
present
won
the
game
but
when
Gollum
PROLOGUE
went
fetch
from
his
island
found
the
treasure
was
gone
magic
ring
which
had
been
given
him
long
ago
his
birthday
Bilbo
guessed
that
this
was
the
very
ring
that
had
found
and
had
won
the
game
was
already
his
right
But
being
tight
place
said
nothing
about
and
made
Gollum
show
him
the
way
out
reward
instead
present
This
account
Bilbo
set
down
his
memoirs
and
seems
never
have
altered
himself
not
even
after
the
Council
Elrond
Evidently
still
appeared
the
original
Red
Book
did
several
the
copies
and
abstracts
But
many

the
true
account
alternative
derived

Frodo
Samwise

whom
learned
the
truth
though
they
seem
have
been
unwilling
delete
anything
actually
written
the
old
hobbit
himself
Gandalf
however
disbelieved
Bilbo
first
story
soon
heard
and
continued
very
curious
about
the
ring
Eventu
ally
got
the
true
tale
out
Bilbo
after
much
questioning
which
for
while
strained
their
friendship
but
the
wizard
seemed
think
the
truth
important
Though
did
not
say
Bilbo
also
thought
important
and
disturbing
find
that
the
good
hobbit
had
not
told
the
truth
from
the
first
quite
contrary
his
habit
The
idea
present
was
not
mere
hobbitlike
invention
all
the
same
was
suggested
Bilbo
confessed
Gollum
talk
that
overheard
for
Gollum
did
fact
call
the
ring
his
birthday

many
times
That
also
Gandalf
thought
strange
and
suspicious
but
did
not
discover
the
truth
this
point
for
many
more
years
will
seen

book
Bilbo

adventures
little
more
need
said
here
With
the
help

escaped
from

and

many
their

oral
were

were
also
concerned
with

the
Kingdom

and
many
their

studied
its
ancient
histories

the

the

the

Age
there
were
already
found
the
Shire
several
libraries
that
contained
many
historical
books

records
The
largest
these

were
probably
Undertowers

This

from

most
important
source
for

back
the
Shire
together
with
many
loose
leaves
notes
and
during
1420
nearly
filled
its
pages
with
his
account
the

But
annexed
and
preserved
with
probably
single
red
case
were
the
three
large

that
Bilbo
gave
him

these
four
volumes
there
was
added

other

The

were

LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
When
Bilbo
Baggins
Bag
End
announced
that
would
shortly
celebrating
his
eleventy
first
birthday
with
party
special
mag
nificence
there
was
much
talk
and
excitement
Hobbiton
Bilbo
was
very
rich
and
very
peculiar
and
had
been
the
wonder
the
Shire
for
sixty
years
ever
since
his
remarkable
disappearance
and
unexpected
return
The
riches
had
brought
back
from
his
travels
had
now
become
local
legend
and
was
popularly
believed
whatever
the
old
folk
might
say
that
the
Hill
Bag
End
was
full
tunnels
stuffed
with
treasure
And
that
was
not
enough
for
fame
there
was
also
his
prolonged
vigour
marvel
Time
wore
but
seemed
have
little
effect
Baggins
ninety
was
much
the
same
fifty
ninety
nine
they
began
call
him
well
preserved
but
unchanged
would
have
been
nearer
the
mark
There
were
some
that
shook
their
heads
and
thought
this
was
too
much
good
thing
seemed
unfair
that
anyone
should
possess
apparently
perpetual
youth
well
reputedly
inexhaustible
wealth
will
have
paid
for
they
said
isn
natural
and
trouble
will
come
But
far
trouble
had
not
come
and
Baggins
was
generous
with
his
money
most
people
were
willing
forgive
him
his
oddities
and
his
good
fortune
remained
visiting
terms
with
his
relatives
except
course
the
Sackville
Bagginses
and
had
many
voted
admirers
among
the
hobbits
poor
and
unimportant
families
But
had
close
friends
until
some
his
younger
cousins
began
grow
The
eldest
these
and
Bilbo
favourite
was
young
Frodo
Baggins
When
Bilbo
was
ninety
nine
adopted
Frodo
his
heir
and
brought
him
live
Bag
End
and
the
hopes
the
Sackville
Bagginses
were
finally
dashed
Bilbo
and
Frodo
happened
have
the
same
birthday
September
22nd
You
had
better
come
and
live
here
Frodo
lad
said
Bilbo
one
day
and
then
can
celebrate
our
birthday
parties
comfortably
together
that
time
Frodo
was
still
his
tweens
the
hobbits
called
the
irresponsible
twenties
between
childhood
and
coming
age
thirty
three
Twelve
more
years
passed
Each
year
the
Bagginses
had
given
very
lively
combined
birthday
parties
Bag
End
but
now
was
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
understood
that
something
quite
exceptional
was
being
planned
for
that
autumn
Bilbo
was
going
eleventy
one
111
rather
curious
number
and
very
respectable
age
for
hobbit
the
Old
Took
himself
had
only
reached
130
and
Frodo
was
going
thirty
three
important
number
the
date
his
coming
age
Tongues
began
wag
Hobbiton
and
Bywater
and
rumour
the
coming
event
travelled
all
over
the
Shire
The
history
and
charac
ter
Bilbo
Baggins
became
once
again
the
chief
topic
conver
sation
and
the
older
folk
suddenly
found
their
reminiscences
welcome
demand
one
had
more
attentive
audience
than
old
Ham
Gamgee
commonly
known
the
Gaffer
held
forth
The
Ivy
Bush
small
inn
the
Bywater
road
and
spoke
with
some
authority
for
had
tended
the
garden
Bag
End
for
forty
years
and
had
helped
old
Holman
the
same
job
before
that
Now
that
was
himself
growing
old
and
stiff
the
joints
the
job
was
mainly
carried
his
youngest
son
Sam
Gamgee
Both
father
and
son
were
very
friendly
terms
with
Bilbo
and
Frodo
They
lived
the
Hill
itself
Number
Bagshot
Row
just
below
Bag
End
very
nice
well
spoken
gentlehobbit
Bilbo
always
said
the
Gaffer
declared
With
perfect
truth
for
Bilbo
was
very
polite
him
calling
him
Master
Hamfast
and
consulting
him
constantly
upon
the
growing
vegetables
the
matter
roots
especially
potatoes
the
Gaffer
was
recognized
the
leading
authority
all
the
neighbourhood
including
himself
But
what
about
this
Frodo
that
lives
with
him
asked
Old
Noakes
Bywater
Baggins
his
name
but
more
than
half
Brandy
buck
they
say
beats
why
any
Baggins
Hobbiton
should
looking
for
wife
away
there
Buckland
where
folks
are
queer
And
wonder
they
queer
put
Daddy
Twofoot
the
Gaffer
next
door
neighbour
they
live
the
wrong
side
the
Brandywine
River
and
right
agin
the
Old
Forest
That
dark
bad
place
half
the
tales
true
You
right
Dad
said
the
Gaffer
Not
that
the
Brandybucks
Buckland
live
the
Old
Forest
but
they
queer
breed
seem
ingly
They
fool
about
with
boats
that
big
river
and
that
isn
natural
Small
wonder
that
trouble
came
say
But
that
may
Frodo
nice
young
hobbit
you
could
wish
meet
Very
much
like
Bilbo
and
more
than
looks
After
all
his
father
was
Baggins
decent
respectable
hobbit
was
Drogo
Baggins
there
was
never
much
tell
him
till
was
drownded
Drownded
said
several
voices
They
had
heard
this
and
other
darker
rumours
before
course
but
hobbits
have
passion
for
family
history
and
they
were
ready
hear
again
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
Well
they
say
said
the
Gaffer
You
see
Drogo
married
poor
Miss
Primula
Brandybuck
She
was
our
Bilbo
first
cousin
the
mother
side
her
mother
being
the
youngest
the
Old
Took
daughters
and
Drogo
was
his
second
cousin
Frodo
his
first
and
second
cousin
once
removed
either
way
the
saying
you
follow
And
Drogo
was
staying
Brandy
Hall
with
his
father
law
old
Master
Gorbadoc
often
did
after
his
marriage
him
being
partial
his
vittles
and
old
Gorbadoc
keeping
mighty
generous
table
and
went
out
boating
the
Brandywine
River
and
and
his
wife
were
drownded
and
poor
Frodo
only
child
and
all
heard
they
went
the
water
after
dinner
the
moonlight
said
Old
Noakes
and
was
Drogo
weight
sunk
the
boat
And
heard
she
pushed
him
and
pulled
her
after
him
said
Sandyman
the
Hobbiton
miller
You
shouldn
listen
all
you
hear
Sandyman
said
the
Gaffer
who
did
not
much
like
the
miller
There
isn
call
talking
pushing
and
pulling
Boats
are
quite
tricky
enough
for
those
that
sit
still
without
looking
further
for
the
cause
trouble
Anyway
there
was
this
Frodo
left
orphan
and
stranded
you
might
say
among
those
queer
Bucklanders
being
brought
anyhow
Brandy
Hall
regular
warren
all
accounts
Old
Master
Gorbadoc
never
had
fewer
than
couple
hundred
relations
the
place
Bilbo
never
did
kinder
deed
than
when
brought
the
lad
back
live
among
decent
folk
But
reckon
was
nasty
knock
for
those
Sackville
Bagginses
They
thought
they
were
going
get
Bag
End
that
time
when
went
off
and
was
thought
dead
And
then
comes
back
and
orders
them
off
and
goes
living
and
living
and
never
looking
day
older
bless
him
And
suddenly
produces
heir
and
has
all
the
papers
made
out
proper
The
Sackville
Bagginses
won
never
see
the
inside
Bag
End
now
hoped
not
There
tidy
bit
money
tucked
away
there
hear
tell
said
stranger
visitor
business
from
Michel
Delving
the
Westfarthing
All
the
top
your
hill
full
tunnels
packed
with
chests
gold
and
silver
and
jools
what
heard
Then
you
heard
more
than
can
speak
answered
the
Gaffer
know
nothing
about
jools
Bilbo
free
with
his
money
and
there
seems
lack
but
know
tunnel
making
saw
Bilbo
when
came
back
matter
sixty
years
ago
when
was

not
long
come
prentice
old
Holman
him
being
dad
cousin
but
had
Bag
End
helping
him
keep
folks
from
trampling
and
trapessing
all
over
the
garden
while
the
sale
was
And
the
middle
all
Bilbo
comes
the
Hill
with
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
pony
and
some
mighty
big
bags
and
couple
chests
don
doubt
they
were
mostly
full
treasure
had
picked
foreign
parts
where
there
mountains
gold
they
say
but
there
wasn
enough
fill
tunnels
But
lad
Sam
will
know
more
about
that
and
out
Bag
End
Crazy
about
stories
the
old
days
and
listens
all
Bilbo
tales
Bilbo
has
learned
him
his
letters
meaning
harm
mark
you
and
hope
harm
will
come
Elves
and
Dragons
says
him
Cabbages
and
potatoes
are
better
for
and
you
Don
getting
mixed
the
business
your
betters
you
land
trouble
too
big
for
you
says
him
And
might
say
others
added
with
look
the
stranger
and
the
miller
But
the
Gaffer
did
not
convince
his
audience
The
legend
Bilbo
wealth
was
now
too
firmly
fixed
the
minds
the
younger
generation
hobbits
but
has
likely
enough
been
adding
what
brought
first
argued
the
miller
voicing
common
opinion
often
away
from
home
And
look
the
outlandish
folk
that
visit
him
dwarves
coming
night
and
that
old
wandering
conjuror
Gandalf
and
all
You
can
say
what
you
like
Gaffer
but
Bag
End
queer
place
and
its
folk
are
queerer
And
you
can
say
what
you
like
about
what
you
know
more
than
you
boating
Sandyman
retorted
the
Gaffer
dislik
ing
the
miller
even
more
than
usual
that
being
queer
then
could
with
bit
more
queerness
these
parts
There
some
not
far
away
that
wouldn
offer
pint
beer
friend
they
lived

with

But
they

Our
Sam
says
that
everyone
going
invited
the
party
and
there
going

you
presents
for
all
this

That
very
month
was
September
and
fine
you
could
ask

two
later
rumour
probably
started
the
knowledgeable
Sam
was
spread
about
that
there
were
going
fireworks
fire
works
what
more
such
had
not
been
seen
the

for

century
not
indeed
since
the

Days
passed
and
The

drew
nearer
odd
looking
waggon
laden
with
odd
looking
packages
rolled
into

one
evening
and
toiled
the
Hill

The
startled
hobbits
peered
out
lamplit
doors

was
driven
outlandish
folk
singing
strange
songs
dwarves
with
long
beards
and
deep
hoods
few
them
remained
Bag

the

the
second

Sep
tember
cart
came
through
Bywater
from
the
direction
Brandy
wine
Bridge
broad
daylight
old
man
was
driving
all
alone
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
wore
tall
pointed
blue
hat
long
grey
cloak
and
silver
scarf
had
long
white
beard
and
bushy
eyebrows
that
stuck
out
beyond
the
brim
his
hat
Small
hobbit
children
ran
after
the
cart
all
through
Hobbiton
and
right
the
hill
had
cargo
fireworks
they
rightly
guessed
Bilbo
front
door
the
old
man
began
unload
there
were
great
bundles
fireworks
all
sorts
and
shapes
each
labelled
with
large
red
and
the
elf
rune
That
was
Gandalf
mark
course
and
the
old
man
was
Gandalf
the
Wizard
whose
fame
the
Shire
was
due
mainly
his
skill
with
fires
smokes
and
lights
His
real
business
was
far
more
difficult
and
dangerous
but
the
Shire
folk
knew
nothing
about
them
was
just
one
the
attractions
the
Party
Hence
the
excitement
the
hobbit
children
for
Grand
they
shouted
and
the
old
man
smiled
They
knew
him

though
only
appeared
Hobbi
ton
occasionally
and
never
stopped
long
but
neither
they
nor
any
but
the
oldest
their
elders
had
seen
one
his
firework
displays
they
now
belonged
legendary
past
When
the
old
man
helped
Bilbo
and
some
dwarves
had
finished
unloading
Bilbo
gave
few
pennies
away
but
not
single
squib
cracker
was
forthcoming
the
disappointment
the
onlookers
Run
away
now
said
Gandalf
You
will
get
plenty
when
the
time
comes
Then
disappeared
inside
with
Bilbo
and
the
door
was
shut
The
young
hobbits
stared
the
door
vain
for
while
and
then
made
off
feeling
that
the
day
the
party
would
never
come
Inside
Bag
End
Bilbo
and
Gandalf
were
sitting
the
open
window
small
room
looking
out
west
the
garden
The
late
afternoon
was
bright
and
peaceful
The
flowers
glowed
red
and
golden
snap
dragons
and
sunflowers
and
nasturtians
trailing
all
over
the
turf
walls
and
peeping
the
round
windows
How
bright
your
garden
looks
said
Gandalf
Yes
said
Bilbo
very
fond
indeed
and
all
the
dear
old
Shire
but
think

The
next
day
more
carts
rolled
the
Hill
and
still
more
carts
There
might
have
been
some
grumbling
about
dealing
locally
but
that
very
week
orders
began
pour
out
Bag

for
every
kind
provision

that

Bywater
anywhere
the
neighbourhood
People
became
enthusiastic
and
they
began
tick
off
the
days
the
calendar
and
they
watched
eagerly
for
the
postman
hoping
for
invitations
Before
long
the
invitations
began
pouring
out
and
the
Hobbiton
post
office
was
blocked
and
the
Bywater
post
office
was
snowed
under
and
voluntary

were
called
for
There

ADMITTANCE
EXCEPT
PARTY
BUSINESS
Even
those
who
had
pretended
have
Party
Business
were
seldom
allowed
inside
Bilbo
was
busy
writing
invitations
ticking
off
answers
packing
presents
and
making
some
private
preparations
his
own
From
the
time
Gandalf
arrival
remained
hidden
from
view
One
morning
the
hobbits
woke
find
the
large
field
south
Bilbo
front
door
covered
with
ropes
and
poles
for
tents
and
pav
ilions
special
entrance
was
cut
into
the
bank
leading
the
road
and
wide
steps
and
large
white
gate
were
built
there
The
three
hobbit
families
Bagshot
Row
adjoining
the
field
were
intensely
interested
and
generally
envied
Old
Gaffer
Gamgee
stopped
even
pretending
work
his
garden
The
tents
began
There
was
specially
large
pavilion
big
that
the
tree
that
grew
the
field
was
right
inside
and
stood
proudly
near
one
end
the
head
the
chief
table
Lanterns
were
hung
all
its
branches
More

Bag
End
Excitement
rose
its
height
Then
the
weather
clouded
over
That
was
Wednesday
the
eve
the
Party
Anxiety
was
intense
Then
Thursday
September
the
22nd
actually
dawned
The
sun
got
the
clouds
vanished
flags
were
unfurled
and
the
fun
began
Bilbo
Baggins
called
party
but
was
really
variety
enter
tainments
rolled
into
one
Practically
everybody
living
near
was
invited
very
few
were
overlooked
accident
but
they
turned
all
the
same
that
did
not
matter
Many
people
from
other
parts
the
Shire
were
also
asked
and
there
were
even
few
from
outside
the
borders
Bilbo
met
the
guests
and
additions
the
new
white
gate
person
gave
away
presents
all
and
sundry
the
latter
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
were
those
who
went
out
again
back
way
and
came
again
the
gate
Hobbits
give
presents
other
people
their
own
birthdays
Not
very
expensive
ones
rule
and
not
lavishly
this
occasion
but
was
not
bad
system
Actually
Hobbiton
and
Bywater
every
day
the
year
was
somebody
birthday
that
every
hobbit
those
parts
had
fair
chance
least
one
present
least
once
week
But
they
never
got
tired
them
this
occasion
the
presents
were
unusually
good
The
hobbit
children
were
excited
that
for
while
they
almost
forgot
about
eating
There
were
toys
the
like
which
they
had
never
seen
before
all
beautiful
and
some
obviously
magical
Many
them
had
indeed
been
ordered
year
before
and
had
come
all
the
way
from
the
Mountain
and
from
Dale
and
were
real
dwarf
make
When
every
guest
had
been
welcomed
and
was
finally
inside
the
gate
there
were
songs
dances
music
games
and
course
food
and
drink
There
were
three
official
meals
lunch
tea
and
dinner
supper
But
lunch
and
tea
were
marked
chiefly
the
fact
that
those
times
all
the
guests
were
sitting
down
and
eating
together
other
times
there
were
merely
lots
people
eating
and
drinking
continuously
from
elevenses
until
six
thirty
when
the
fireworks
started
The
fireworks
were
Gandalf
they
were
not
only
brought
him
but
designed
and
made
him
and
the
special
effects
set
pieces
and
flights
rockets
were
let
off
him
But
there
was
also
generous
distribution
squibs
crackers
backarappers
sparklers
torches
dwarf
candles
elf
fountains
goblin
barkers
and
thunder
claps
They
were
all
superb
The
art
Gandalf
improved
with
age
There
were
rockets
like
flight
scintillating
birds
singing
with
sweet
voices
There
were
green
trees
with
trunks
dark
smoke
their
leaves
opened
like
whole
spring
unfolding
moment
and
their
shining
branches
dropped
glowing
flowers
down
upon
the
astonished
hobbits
disappearing
with
sweet
scent
just
before
they
touched
their
upturned
faces
There
were
fountains
butterflies
that
flew
glittering
into
the
trees
there
were
pillars
coloured
fires
that
rose
and
turned
into
eagles
sailing
ships
phalanx
flying
swans
there
was
red
thunderstorm
and
shower
yellow
rain
there
was
forest
silver
spears
that
sprang
suddenly
into
the
air
with
yell
like
embattled
army
and
came
down
again
into
the
Water
with
hiss
like
hundred
hot
snakes
And
there
was
also
one
last
surprise
honour
Bilbo
and
startled
the
hobbits
exceedingly
Gandalf
intended
The
lights
went
out
great
smoke
went
shaped
itself
like
mountain
seen
the
distance
and
began
glow
the
summit
spouted
green
and
scarlet
flames
Out
flew
red
golden
dragon
not
life
size
but
terribly
life
like
fire
came
from
his
jaws
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
his
eyes
glared
down
there
was
roar
and
whizzed
three
times
over
the
heads
the
crowd
They
all
ducked
and
many
fell
flat
their
faces
The
dragon
passed
like
express
train
turned
somer
sault
and
burst
over
Bywater
with
deafening
explosion
That
the
signal
for
supper
said
Bilbo
The
pain
and
alarm
vanished
once
and
the
prostrate
hobbits
leaped
their
feet
There
was
splendid
supper
for
everyone
for
everyone
that
except
those
invited
the
special
family

This
was
held
the
great

the

The

Gross

considered
proper
use
people
and
the
guests
were
selected
from
all
the
families
which
Bilbo
and
Frodo
were
related
with
the
addition
few
special
unrelated
friends
such
Gandalf
Many
young
hobbits
were
included
and
present
parental
per
mission
for
hobbits
were
easy
going
with
their
children
the
matter
sitting
late
especially
when
there
was
chance
getting
them
free
meal
Bringing
young
hobbits
took
lot

There
were
many
Bagginses
and
Boffins
and
also
many
Tooks
and
Brandybucks
there
were
various
Grubbs
relations
Bilbo
Baggins
grandmother
and
various
Chubbs
connexions
his
Took
grand
father
and
selection
Burrowses
Bolgers
Bracegirdles
Brock
houses
Goodbodies
Hornblowers
and
Proudfoots
Some
these
were
only
very
distantly
connected
with
Bilbo
and
some
had
hardly
ever
been
Hobbiton
before
they
lived
remote
corners
the
Shire
The
Sackville
Bagginses
were
not
forgotten
Otho
and
his
wife
Lobelia
were
present
They
disliked
Bilbo
and
detested
Frodo
but
magnificent
was
the
invitation
card
written
golden
ink
that
they
had
felt
was
impossible
refuse
Besides
their
cousin
Bilbo
had
been
specializing
food
for
many
years
and
his
table
had
high
reputation
All
the
one
hundred
and
forty
four
guests
expected
pleasant
feast
though
they
rather
dreaded
the
after
dinner
speech
their
host
inevitable
item
was
liable
drag
bits
what
called
poetry
and
sometimes
after
glass
two
would
allude
the
absurd
adventures
his
mysterious
journey
The
guests
were
not
disappointed
they
had
very
pleasant
feast
fact
engrossing
entertainment
rich
abundant
varied
and
prolonged
The
purchase
provisions
fell
almost
nothing
throughout
the
district
the
ensuing
weeks
but
Bilbo
catering
had
depleted
the
stocks
most
the
stores
cellars
and
warehouses
for
miles
around
that
did
not
matter
much
After
the
feast
more
less
came
the
Speech
Most
the
com
pany
were
however
now
tolerant
mood
that
delightful
stage
which
they
called
filling
the
corners
They
were
sipping
their
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
favourite
drinks
and
nibbling
their
favourite
dainties
and
their
fears
were
forgotten
They
were
prepared
listen
anything
and
cheer
every
full
stop
dear
People
began
Bilbo
rising
his
place
Hear
Hear
Hear
they
shouted
and
kept
repeating
chorus
seeming
reluctant
follow
their
own
advice
Bilbo
left
his
place
and
went
and
stood
chair
under
the
illuminated
tree
The
light
the
lanterns
fell
his
beaming
face
the
golden
buttons
shone
his
embroidered
silk
waistcoat
They
could
all
see
him
standing
waving
one
hand
the
air
the
other
was
his
trouser
pocket
dear
Bagginses
and
Boffins

ProudFEET
shouted
elderly
hobbit
from
the
back
the
pavilion
His
name
course
was
Proudfoot
and
well
merited
his
feet
were
large
exceptionally
furry
and
both
were
the
table
Proudfoots
repeated
Bilbo
Also

Bag
End
Today
one
hundred
and
eleventh
birthday
eleventy
one
today
Hurray
Hurray
Many
Happy
Returns
they
shouted
and
they
hammered
joyously
the
tables
Bilbo
was
doing
splendidly
This
was
the
sort
stuff
they
liked
short
and
obvious
hope
you
are
all
enjoying
yourselves
much
Deafening
cheers
Cries
Yes
and
Noises
trumpets
and
horns
pipes
and
flutes
and
other
musical
instruments
There
were
has
been
said
many
young
hobbits
present
Hundreds
musical
crackers
had
been
pulled
Most
them
bore
the
mark
DALE
them
which
did
not
convey
much
most
the
hobbits
but
they
all
agreed
they
were
marvellous
crackers
They
contained
instruments
small
but
perfect
make
and
enchanting
tones
Indeed
one
corner
some
the
young
Tooks
and
Brandybucks
supposing
Uncle
Bilbo
have
finished
since
had
plainly
said
all
that
was
necessary
now
got
impromptu
orchestra
and
began
merry
dance
tune
Master
Everard
Took
and
Miss
Melilot
Brandybuck
got
table
and
with
bells
their
hands
began
dance
the
Springle
ring
pretty
dance
but
rather
vigorous
But
Bilbo
had
not
finished
Seizing
horn
from
youngster
nearby
blew
three
loud
hoots
The
noise
subsided
shall
not
keep
you
long
cried
Cheers
from
all
the
assembly
have
called
you
all
together
for
Purpose
Something
the
way
that
said
this
made
impression
There
was
almost
silence
and
one
two
the
Tooks
pricked
their
ears
Indeed
for
Three
Purposes
First
all
tell
you
that
immensely
fond
you
all
and
that
eleventy
one
years
too
short
time
live
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
among
such
excellent
and
admirable
hobbits
Tremendous
outburst
approval
don
know
half
you
half
well
should
like
and
ltke
less
than
half
you
half
well
you
deserve
This
was
unexpected
and
rather
difficult
There
was
some
scattered
clapping
but
most
them
were
trying
work
out
and
see
came
compliment
Secondly
celebrate
birthday
Cheers
again
should
say
OUR
birthday
For
course
also
the
birthday
heir
and
nephew
Frodo
comes
age
and
into
his
inheritance
today
Some
perfunctory
clapping
the
elders
and
some
loud
shouts
Frodo
Frodo
Jolly
old
Frodo
from
the
juniors
The
Sackville
Bagginses
scowled
and
wondered
what
was
meant
coming
into
his
inheritance
Together
score
one
hundred
and
forty
four
Your
numbers
were
chosen
fit
this
remarkable
total
One
Gross
may
use
the
expression
cheers
This
was
ridiculous
Many
the
guests
and
especially
the
Sackville
Bagginses
were
insulted
feeling
sure
they
had
only
been
asked
fill
the
required
number
like
goods

One

Vulgar

also
may
allowed

Esgaroth

Long
Lake
though
the
fact
that
was
birthday
slipped
memory
that
occasion
was
only
fifty
one
then
and
birthdays
did
not
seem
important
The
banquet
was
very
splendid
however
though
had
bad
cold
the
time
remember
and
could
only
say
thag
you
very
buch
now
repeat
more
correctly
Thank
you
very
much
for
coming
little
party
Obstinate
silence
They
all
feared
that
song
some
poetry
was
now
imminent
and
they
were
getting
bored
Why
couldn
stop
talking
and
let
them
drink
his
health
But
Bilbo
did
not
sing
recite
paused
for
moment
Thirdly
and
finally
said
wish
make
ANNOUNCEMENT
spoke
this
last
word
loudly
and
suddenly
that
everyone
sat
who
still
could
regret
announce
that
though
said
eleventy
one
years
far
too
short
time
spend
among
you
this
the
END
going
leaving
NOW
GOOD
BYE
stepped
down
and
vanished
There
was
blinding
flash
light
and
the
guests
all
blinked
When
they
opened
their
eyes
Bilbo
was
nowhere
seen
One
hundred
and
forty
four
flabbergasted
hobbits
sat
back
speechless
Old
Odo
Proudfoot
removed
his
feet
from
the
table
and
stamped
Then
there
was
dead
silence

PARTY
food
and
drink
were
needed
cure
the
guests
shock
and
annoyance
mad
always
said
was
probably
the
most
popular
comment
Even
the
Tooks
with
few
exceptions
thought
Bilbo
behaviour
was
absurd
For
the
moment
most
them
took
for
granted
that
his
disappearance
was
nothing
more
than
ridiculous
prank
But
old
Rory
Brandybuck
was
not
sure
Neither
age
nor
enormous
dinner
had
clouded
his
wits
and
said
his
daughter
law
Esmeralda
There
something
fishy
this
dear
believe
that
mad
Baggins
off
again
Silly
old
fool
But
why
worry
hasn
taken
the
vittles
with
him
called
loudly
Frodo
send
the
wine
round
again
Frodo
was
the
only
one
present
who
had
said
nothing
For
some
time
had
sat
silent
beside
Bilbo
empty
chair
and
ignored
all
remarks
and
questions
had
enjoyed
the
joke
course
even
though
had
been
the
know
had
difficulty
keeping
from
laughter
the
indignant
surprise
the
guests
But
the
same
time
felt
deeply
troubled
realized
suddenly
that
loved
the
old
hobbit
dearly
Most
the
guests
went
eating
and
drinking
and
discussing
Bilbo
Baggins
oddities
past
and
present
but
the
Sackville
Bagginses
had
already
departed
wrath
Frodo
did
not
want
have
any
more
with
the
party
gave
orders
for
more
wine
served
then
got
and
drained
his
own
glass
silently
the
health
Bilbo
and
slipped
out
the
pavilion
for
Bilbo
Baggins
even
while
was
making
his
speech
had
been
fingering
the
golden
ring
his
pocket
his
magic
ring
that
had
kept
secret
for
many
years
stepped
down
slipped
his
finger
and
was
never
seen
any
hobbit
Hobbiton
again
walked
briskly
back
his
hole
and
stood
for
moment
listen
ing
with
smile
the
din
the
pavilion
and
the
sounds
merrymaking
other
parts
the
field
Then
went
took
off
his
party
clothes
folded
and
wrapped
tissue
paper
his
embroidered
silk
waistcoat
and
put
away
Then
put
quickly
some
old
untidy
garments
and
fastened
round
his
waist
worn
leather
belt
hung
short
sword
battered
black
leather
scabbard
From
locked
drawer
smelling
moth
balls
took
out
old
cloak
and
hood
They
had
been
locked
they
were
very
precious
but
they
were
patched
and
weatherstained
that
their
original
colour
could
hardly
guessed
might
have
been
dark
green
They
were
rather
too
large
for
him
then
went
into
his
study
and
from
large
strong
box
took
out
bundle
wrapped
old
cloths
and
leather
bound
manuscript
and
also
large
bulky
envelope
The
book
and
bundle
stuffed
into
the
top
heavy
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
bag
that
was
standing
there
already
nearly
full
Into
the
envelope
slipped
his
golden
ring
and
its
fine
chain
and
then
sealed
and
addressed
Frodo
first
put
the
mantelpiece
but
suddenly
removed
and
stuck
his
pocket
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
Gandalf
came
quickly
Hullo
said
Bilbo
wondered
you
would
turn
glad
find
you
visible
replied
the
wizard
sitting
down
chair
wanted
catch
you
and
have
few
final
words
suppose
you
feel
that
everything
has
gone
off
splendidly
and
according
plan
Yes
said
Bilbo
Though
that
flash
was
surprising
quite
startled
let
alone
the
others
little
addition
your
own
suppose
was
You
have
wisely
kept
that
ring
secret
all
these
years
and
seemed
necessary
give
your
guests
something
else
that
would
seem
explain
your
sudden
vanishment
And
would
spoil
joke
You
are
interfering
old
busybody
laughed
Bilbo
but
expect
you
know
best
usual
when
know
anything
But
don
feel
too
sure
about
this
whole
affair
has
now
come
the
final
point
You
have
had
your
joke
and
alarmed
offended
most
your
relations
and
given
the
whole
Shire
something
talk
about
for
nine
days
ninety
nine
more
likely
Are
you
going
any
further
Yes
feel
need
holiday
very
long
holiday
have
told
you
before
Probably
permanent
holiday
don
expect
shall
return
fact
don
mean
and
have
made
all
arrangements
old
Gandalf
don
look
but
beginning
feel
heart
hearts
Well
preserved
indeed
snorted
Why
feel
all
thin
sort
stretched
you
know
what
mean
like
butter
that
has
been
scraped
over
too
much
bread
That
can
right
need
change
something
Gandalf
looked
curiously
and
closely
him
does
not
seem
right
said
thoughtfully
after
all
believe
your
plan
probably
the
best
Well
made
mind
anyway
want
see
mountains
again
Gandalf
mountains
and
then
find
somewhere
where
can
rest
peace
and
quiet
without
lot
relatives
prying
around
and
string
confounded
visitors
hanging
the
bell
might
find
somewhere
where
can
finish
book
have
thought
nice
ending
for
and
lived
happily
ever
after
the
end
his
days
Gandalf
laughed
hope
will
But
nobody
will
read
the
book
however
ends
they
may
years
come
Frodo
has
read
some
already
far
has
gone
You
keep
eye
Frodo
won
you
Yes
will
two
eyes
often
can
spare
them
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
would
come
with
course
asked
him
fact
offered
once
just
before
the
party
But
does
not
really
want
yet
want
see
the
wild
country
again
before
die
and
the
Mountains
but
still
love
with
the
Shire
with
woods
and
fields
and
little
rivers
ought
comfortable
here
leaving
everything
him
course
except
few
oddments
hope
will
happy
when
gets
used
being
his
own
time
was
his
own
master
now
Everything
said
Gandalf
The
ring
well
You
agreed
that
you
remember
Well
yes
suppose
stammered
Bilbo
Where
envelope
you
must
know
said
Bilbo
impatiently
There
the
mantelpiece
Well
Here
pocket
hesitated
Isn
that
odd
now
said
softly
himself
Yet
after
all
why
not
Why
shouldn
stay
there
Gandalf
looked
again
very
hard
Bilbo
and
there
was
gleam
his
eyes
think
Bilbo
said
quietly
should
leave
behind
Don
you
want
Well
yes
and
Now
comes
don
like
parting
with
all
may
say
And
don
really
see
why
should
Why
you
want
asked
and
curious
change
came
over
his
voice
was
sharp
with
suspicion
and
annoyance
You
are
always
badgering
about
ring
but
you
have
never
bothered
about
the
other
things
that
got
journey
but
had
badger
you
said
Gandalf
wanted
the
truth
was
important
Magic
rings
are
well
magical
and
they
are
rare
and
curious
was
professionally
interested
your
ring
you
may
say
and
still
should
like
know
where
you
wandering
again
Also
think
you
have
had
quite
long
enough
You
won
need
any
more
Bilbo
unless
quite
mistaken
Bilbo
flushed
and
there
was
angry
light
his
eyes
His
kindly
face
grew
hard
Why
not
cried
And
what
business
yours
anyway
know
what
with
own
things
own
found
came
Yes
yes
said
Gandalf
But
there
need
get
angry
your
fault
said
Bilbo
mine
tell
you
own
Precious
Yes
Precious
The
wizard
face
remained
grave
and
attentive
and
only
flicker
his
deep
eyes
showed
that
was
startled
and
indeed
alarmed
has
been
called
that
before
said
but
not
you
But
say
now
And
why
not
Even
Gollum
said
the
same
once
not
his
now
but
mine
And
shall
keep
say
Gandalf
stood
spoke
sternly
You
will
fool
you
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Bilbo
said
You
make
that
clearer
with
every
word
you
say
has
got
far
too
much
hold
you
Let
And
then
you
can
yourself
and
free
choose
and
please
said
Bilbo
obstinately
Now
now
dear
hobbit
said
Gandalf
All
your
long
life
have
been
friends
and
you
owe
something
Come
you
promised
give
Well
you
want
ring
yourself
say
cried
Bilbo
But
you
won
get
won
give
Precious
away
tell
you
His
hand
strayed
the
hilt
his
small
sword
Gandalf
eyes
flashed
will
turn
get
angry
soon
said
you
say
that
again
shall
Then
you
will
see
Gandalf
the
Grey
uncloaked
took
step
towards
the
hobbit
and
seemed
grow
tall
and
menacing
his
shadow
filled
the
little
room
Bilbo
backed
away
the
wall
breathing
hard
his
hand
clutching
his
pocket
They
stood
for
while
facing
one
another
and
the
air
the
room
tingled
Gandalf
eyes
remained
bent
the
hobbit
Slowly
his
hands
relaxed
and
began
tremble
don
know
what
has
come
over
you
Gandalf
said
You
have
never
been
like
this
before
What
all
about
mine
isn
found
and
Gollum
would
have
killed
hadn
kept
not
thief
whatever
said
have
never
called
you
one
Gandalf
answered
And
not
one
either
not
trying
rob
you
but
help
you
wish
you
would
trust
you
used
turned
away
and
the
shadow
passed
seemed
dwindle
again
old
grey
man
bent
and
troubled
Bilbo
drew
his
hand
over
his
eyes
sorry
said
But
felt
queer
And
yet
would
relief
way
not
bothered
with
any
more
has
been
growing
mind
lately
Sometimes
have
felt
was
like
eye
looking
And
always
wanting
put
and
disappear
don
you
know
wondering
safe
and
pulling
out
make
sure
tried
locking
but
found
couldn
rest
without
pocket
don
know
why
And
don
seem
able
make
mind
Then
trust
mine
said
Gandalf
quite
made
away
and
leave
behind
Stop
possessing
Give
Frodo
and
will
look
after
him
Bilbo
stood
for
moment
tense
and
undecided
Presently
sighed
All
right
said
with
effort
will
Then
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
rather
ruefully
After
all
that
what
this
party
business
was
all
about
really
give
away
lots
birthday
presents
and
somehow
make
easier
give
away
the
same
time
hasn
made
any
easier
the
end
but
would
pity
waste
all
preparations
would
quite
spoil
the
joke
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
Indeed
would
take
away
the
only
point
ever
saw
the
affair
said
Gandalf
Very
well
said
Bilbo
goes
Frodo
with
all
the
rest
drew
deep
breath
And
now
really
must
starting
somebody
else
will
catch
have
said
good
bye
and
couldn
bear
all
over
again
picked
his
bag
and
moved
the
door
You
have
still
got
the
ring
your
pocket
said
the
wizard
Well
have
cried
Bilbo
And
will
and
all
the
other
documents
too
You
had
better
take
and
deliver
for
That
will
safest
don
give
the
ring
said
Gandalf
Put
the
mantel
piece
will
safe
enough
there
till
Frodo
comes
shall
wait
for
him
Bilbo
took
out
the
envelope
but
just
was
about
set
the
clock
his
hand
jerked
back
and
the
packet
fell
the
floor
Before
could
pick
the
wizard
stooped
and
seized
and
set
its
place
spasm
anger
passed
swiftly
over
the
hobbit
face
again
Suddenly
gave
way
look
relief
and
laugh
Well
that
that
said
Now
off
They
went
out
into
the
hall
Bilbo
chose
his
favourite
stick
from
the
stand
then
whistled
Three
dwarves
came
out
different
rooms
where
they
had
been
busy
everything
ready
asked
Bilbo
Everything
packed
and
labelled
Everything
they
answered
Well
let
start
then
stepped
out
the
front
door
was
fine
night
and
the
black
sky
was
dotted
with
stars
looked
sniffing
the
air
What
fun
What
fun
off
again
off
the
Road
with
dwarves
This
what
have
really
been
longing
for
for
years
Good
bye
said
looking
his
old
home
and
bowing
the
door
Good
bye
Gandalf
Good
bye
for
the
present
Bilbo
Take
care
yourself
You
are
old
enough
and
perhaps
wise
enough
Take
care
don
care
Don
you
worry
about
happy
now
have
ever
been
and
that
saying
great
deal
But
the
time
has
come
being
swept
off
feet
last
added
and
then
low
voice
himself
sang
softly
the
dark
The
Road
goes
ever
and
Down
from
the
door
where
began
Now
far
ahead
the
Road
has
gone
And
must
follow
can
Pursuing
with
eager
feet
Until
joins
some
larger
way
Where
many
paths
and
errands
meet
And
whither
then
cannot
say
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
paused
silent
for
moment
Then
without
another
word
turned
away
from
the
lights
and
voices
the
field
and
tents
and
followed
his
three
companions
went
round
into
his
garden
and
trotted
down
the
long
sloping
path
jumped
over
low
place
the
hedge
the
bottom
and
took
the
meadows
passing
into
the
night
like
rustle
wind
the
grass
Gandalf
remained
for
while
staring
after
him
into
the
darkness
Good
bye
dear
Bilbo
until
our
next
meeting
said
softly
and
went
back
indoors
Frodo
came
soon
afterwards
and
found
him
sitting
the
dark
deep
thought
Has
gone
asked
Yes
answered
Gandalf
has
gone
last
wish
mean
hoped
until
this
evening
that
was
only
joke
said
Frodo
But
knew
heart
that
really
meant
always
used
joke
about
serious
things
wish
had
come
back
sooner
just
see
him
off
think
really
preferred
slipping
off
quietly
the
end
said
Gandalf
Don
too
troubled
all
right
now
left
packet
for
you
There
Frodo
took
the
envelope
from
the
mantelpiece
and
glanced
but
did
not
open
You
find
his
will
and
all
the
other
documents
there
think
said
the
wizard
You
are
the
master
Bag
End
now
And
also
fancy
youll
find
golden
ring
The
ring
exclaimed
Frodo
Has
left
that
wonder
why
Still
may
useful
may
and
may
not
said
Gandalf
should
not
make
use
were
you
But
keep
secret
and
keep
safe
Now
going
bed
master
Bag
End
Frodo
felt
his
painful
duty
say
good
bye
the
guests
Rumours
strange
events
had
now
spread
all
over
the
field
but
Frodo
would
only
say
doubt
everything
will
cleared
the
morning
About
midnight
carriages
came
for
the
important
folk
One
one
they
rolled
away
filled
with
full
but
very
unsatisfied
hobbits
Gardeners
came
arrangement
and
removed
wheel
barrows
those
that
had
inadvertently
remained
behind
Night
slowly
passed
The
sun
rose
The
hobbits
rose
rather
later
Morning
went
People
came
and
began
orders
clear
away
the
pavilions
and
the
tables
and
the
chairs
and
the
spoons
and
knives
and
bottles
and
plates
and
the
lanterns
and
the
flowering
shrubs
boxes
and
the
crumbs
and
cracker
paper
the
forgotten
bags
and
gloves
and
handkerchiefs
and
the
uneaten
food
very
small
item
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
Then
number
other
people
came
without
orders
Bagginses
and
Boffins
and
Bolgers
and
Tooks
and
other
guests
that
lived
were
staying
near
mid
day
when
even
the
best
fed
were
out
and
about
again
there
was
large
crowd
Bag
End
uninvited
but
not
unexpected
Frodo
was
waiting
the
step
smiling
but
looking
rather
tired
and
worried
welcomed
all
the
callers
but
had
not
much
more
say
than
before
His
reply
all
inquiries
was
simply
this
Bilbo
Baggins
has
gone
away
far
know
for
good
Some
the
visitors
invited
come
inside
Bilbo
had
left
messages
for
them
Inside
the
hall
there
was
piled
large
assortment
packages
and
parcels
and
small
articles
furniture
every
item
there
was
label
tied
There
were
several
labels
this
sort
For
ADELARD
TOOK
for
his
VERY
OWN
from
Bilbo
umbrella
Adelard
had
carried
off
many
unlabelled
ones
For
DORA
BAGGINS
memory
LONG
correspondence
with
love
from
Bilbo
large
waste
paper
basket
Dora
was
Drogo
sister
and
the
eldest
surviving
female
relative
Bilbo
and
Frodo
she
was
ninety
nine
and
had
written
reams
good
advice
for
more
than
half
century
For
MILO
BURROWS
hoping
will
useful
from
gold
pen
and
ink
bottle
Milo
never
answered
letters
For
ANGELICA
use
from
Uncle
Bilbo
round
convex
mirror
She
was
young
Baggins
and
too
obviously
considered
her
face
shapely
For
the
collection
ofp
HUGO
BRACEGIRDLE
from
contributor
empty
book
case
Hugo
was
great
borrower
books
and
worse
than
usual
returning
them
For
LOBELIA
SACKVILLE
BAGGINS
PRESENT
case
silver
spoons
Bilbo
believed
that
she
had
acquired
good
many
his
spoons
while
was
away
his
former
journey
Lobelia
knew
that
quite
well
When
she
arrived
later
the
day
she
took
the
point
once
but
she
also
took
the
spoons
This
only
small
selection
the
assembled
presents
Bilbo
residence
had
got
rather
cluttered
with
things
the
course
his
long
life
was
tendency
hobbit
holes
get
cluttered
for
which
the
custom
giving
many
birthday
presents
was
largely
responsible
Not
course
that
the
birthday
presents
were
always
new
there
were
one
two
old
mathoms
forgotten
uses
that
had
circulated
all
around
the
district
but
Bilbo
had
usually
given
new
presents
and
kept
those
that
received
The
old
hole
was
now
being
cleared
little
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Every
one
the
various
parting
gifts
had
labels
written
out
per
sonally
Bilbo
and
several
had
some
point
some
joke
But
course
most
the
things
were
given
where
they
would
wanted
and
welcome
The
poorer
hobbits
and
especially
those
Bagshot
Row
did
very
well
Old
Gaffer
Gamgee
got
two
sacks
potatoes
new
spade
woollen
waistcoat
and
bottle
ointment
for
creak
ing
joints
Old
Rory
Brandybuck
return
for
much
hospitality
got
dozen
bottles
Old
Winyards
strong
red
wine
from
the
Southfarthing
and
now
quite
mature
had
been
laid
down
Bilbo
father
Rory
quite
forgave
Bilbo
and
voted
him
capital
fellow
after
the
first
bottle
There
was
plenty
everything
left
for
Frodo
And
course
all
the
chief
treasures
well
the
books
pictures
and
more
than
enough
furniture
were
left
his
possession
There
was
however
sign
nor
mention
money
jewellery
not
penny
piece
glass
bead
was
given
away
Frodo
had
very
trying
time
that
afternoon
false
rumour
that
the
whole
household
was
being
distributed
free
spread
like
wildfire
and
before
long
the
place
was
packed
with
people
who
had
business
there
but
could
not
kept
out
Labels
got
torn
off
and
mixed
and
quarrels
broke
out
Some
people
tried
swaps
and
deals
the
hall
and
others
tried
make
off
with
minor
items
not
addressed
them
with
anything
that
seemed
unwanted
unwatched
The
road
the
gate
was
blocked
with
barrows
and
handcarts
the
middle
the
commotion
the
Sackville
Bagginses
arrived
Frodo
had
retired
for
while
and
left
his
friend
Merry
Brandybuck
keep
eye
things
When
Otho
loudly
demanded
see
Frodo
Merry
bowed
politely
indisposed
said
resting
Hiding
you
mean
said
Lobelia
Anyway
want
see
him
and
mean
see
him
Just
and
tell
him
Merry
left
them
long
while
the
hall
and
they
had
time
discover
their
parting
gift
spoons
did
not
improve
their
tempers
Eventually
they
were
shown
into
the
study
Frodo
was
sitting
table
with
lot
papers
front
him
looked
indisposed
see
Sackville
Bagginses
any
rate
and
stood
fidgeting
with
something
his
pocket
But
spoke
quite
politely
The
Sackville
Bagginses
were
rather
offensive
They
began
offering
him
bad
bargain
prices
between
friends
for
various
valu
able
and
unlabelled
things
When
Frodo
replied
that
only
the
things
specially
directed
Bilbo
were
being
given
away
they
said
the
whole
affair
was
very
fishy
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
Only
one
thing
clear
said
Otho
and
that
that
you
are
doing
exceedingly
well
out
insist
seeing
the
will
Otho
would
have
been
Bilbo
heir
but
for
the
adoption
Frodo
read
the
will
carefully
and
snorted
was
unfortunately
very
clear
and
correct
according
the
legal
customs
hobbits
which
demand
among
other
things
seven
signatures
witnesses
red
ink
Foiled
again
said
his
wife
And
after
waiting
szxty
years
Spoons
Fiddlesticks
snapped
his
fingers
under
Frodo
nose
and
stumped
off
But
Lobelia
was
not
easily
got
rid
little
later
Frodo
came
out
the
study
see
how
things
were
going
and
found
her
still
about
the
place
investigating
nooks
and
corners
and
tapping
the
floors
escorted
her
firmly
off
the
premises
after
had
relieved
her
several
small
but
rather
valuable
articles
that
had
somehow
fallen
inside
her
umbrella
Her
face
looked
she
was
the
throes
thinking
out
really
crushing
parting
remark
but
all
she
found
say
turning
round
the
step
was
You
live
regret
young
fellow
Why
didn
you
too
You
don
belong
here
you
Baggins
you
you
Brandybuck
Did
you
hear
that
Merry
That
was
insult
you
like
said
Frodo
shut
the
door
her
was
compliment
said
Merry
Brandybuck
and
course
not
true
Then
they
went
round
the
hole
and
evicted
three
young
hobbits
two
Boffins
and
Bolger
who
were
knocking
holes
the
walls
one
the
cellars
Frodo
also
had
tussle
with
young
Sancho
Proudfoot
old
Odo
Proudfoot
grandson
who
had
begun
exca
vation
the
larger
pantry
where
thought
there
was
echo
The
legend
Bilbo
gold
excited
both
curiosity
and
hope
for
legendary
gold
mysteriously
obtained
not
positively
ill
gotten
every
one
knows
anyone
for
the
finding
unless
the
search
interrupted
When
had
overcome
Sancho
and
pushed
him
out
Frodo
col
lapsed
chair
the
hall
time
close
the
shop
Merry
said
Lock
the
door
and
don
open
anyone
today
not
even
they
bring
battering
ram
Then
went
revive
himself
with
belated
cup
tea
had
hardly
sat
down
when
there
came
soft
knock
the
front
door
Lobelia
again
most
likely
thought
She
must
have
thought
something
really
nasty
and
have
come
back
again
say
can
wait
went
with
his
tea
The
knock
was
repeated
much
louder
but
took
notice
Suddenly
the
wizard
head
appeared
the
window
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
you
don
let
Frodo
shall
blow
your
door
right
down
your
hole
and
out
through
the
hill
said
dear
Gandalf
Half
minute
cried
Frodo
running
out
the
room
the
door
Come
Come
thought
was
Lobelia
Then
forgive
you
But
saw
her
some
time
ago
driving
pony
trap
towards
Bywater
with
face
that
would
have
curdled
new
milk
She
had
already
nearly
curdled
Honestly
nearly
tried
Bilbo
ring
longed
disappear
Don
that
said
Gandalf
sitting
down
careful
that
ring
Frodo
fact
partly
about
that
that
have
come
say
last
word
Well
what
about
What
you
know
already
Only
what
Bilbo
told
have
heard
his
story
how
found
and
how
used
his
journey
mean
Which
story
wonder
said
Gandalf
not
what
told
the
dwarves
and
put
his
book
said
Frodo
told
the
true
story
soon
after
came
live
here
said
you
had
pestered
him
till
told
you
had
better
know
too
secrets
between
Frodo
said
but
they
are
not
any
further
mine
anyway
That
interesting
said
Gandalf
Well
what
did
you
think
all
you
mean
inventing
all
that
about
present
well
thought
the
true
story
much
more
likely
and
couldn
see
the
point
altering
all
was
very
unlike
Bilbo
anyway
and
thought
rather
odd
did
But
odd
things
may
happen
people
that
have
such
treasures
they
use
them
Let
warning
you
very
careful
with
may
have
other
powers
than
just
making
you
vanish
when
you
wish
don
understand
said
Frodo
Neither
answered
the
wizard
have
merely
begun
wonder
about
the
ring
especially
since
last
night
need
worry
But
you
take
advice
you
will
use
very
seldom
not
all
least
beg
you
not
use
any
way
that
will
cause
talk
rouse
suspicion
say
again
keep
safe
and
keep
secret
You
are
very
mysterious
What
are
you
afraid
not
certain
will
say
more
may
able
tell
you
something
when
come
back
going
off
once
this
good
bye
for
the
present
got
once
cried
Frodo
Why
thought
you
were
staying
for
least
week
was
looking
forward
your
help
did
mean
but
have
had
change
mind
may
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
away
for
good
while
but
come
and
see
you
again
soon
can
Expect
when
you
see
shall
slip
quietly
shan
often
visiting
the
Shire
openly
again
find
that
have
become
rather
unpopular
They
say
nuisance
and
disturber
the
peace
Some
people
are
actually
accusing
spiriting
Bilbo
away
worse
you
want
know
there
supposed
plot
between
you
and
get
hold
his
wealth
Some
people
exclaimed
Frodo
You
mean
Otho
and
Lobelia
How
abominable
would
give
them
Bag
End
and
everything
else
could
get
Bilbo
back
and
off
tramping
the
country
with
him
love
the
Shire
But
begin
wish
somehow
that
had
gone
too
wonder
shall
ever
see
him
again
said
Gandalf
And
wonder
many
other
things
Good
bye
now
Take
care
yourself
Look
out
for
especially
unlikely
times
Good
bye
Frodo
saw
him
the
door
gave
final
wave
his
hand
and
walked
off
surprising
pace
but
Frodo
thought
the
old
wizard
looked
unusually
bent
almost
was
carrying
great
weight
The
evening
was
closing
and
his
cloaked
figure
quickly
vanished
into
the
twilight
Frodo
did
not
see
him
again
for
long
time
Chapter
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
The
talk
did
not
die
down
nine
even
ninety
nine
days
The
second
disappearance
Bilbo
Baggins
was
discussed
Hobbi
ton
and
indeed
all
over
the
Shire
for
year
and
day
and
was
remembered
much
longer
than
that
became
fireside
story
for
young
hobbits
and
eventually
Mad
Baggins
who
used
vanish
with
bang
and
flash
and
reappear
with
bags
jewels
and
gold
became
favourite
character
legend
and
lived
long
after
all
the
true
events
were
forgotten
But
the
meantime
the
general
opinion
the
neighbourhood
was
that
Bilbo
who
had
always
been
rather
cracked
had
last
gone
quite
mad
and
had
run
off
into
the
Blue
There
had
undoubtedly
fallen
into
pool
river
and
come
tragic
but
hardly
untimely
end
The
blame
was
mostly
laid
Gandalf
only
that
dratted
wizard
will
leave
young
Frodo
alone
perhaps
settle
down
and
grow
some
hobbit
sense
they
said
And
all
appearance
the
wizard
did
leave
Frodo
alone
and
did
settle
down
but
the
growth
hobbit
sense
was
not
very
noticeable
Indeed
once
began
carry
Bilbo
reputation
for
oddity
refused
into
mourning
and
the
next
year
gave
party
honour
Bilbo
hundred
and
twelfth
birthday
which
called
Hundred
weight
Feast
But
that
was
short
the
mark
for
twenty
guests
were
invited
and
there
were
several
meals
which
snowed
food
and
rained
drink
hobbits
say
Some
people
were
rather
shocked
but
Frodo
kept
the
custom
giving
Bilbo
Birthday
Party
year
after
year
until
they
got
used
said
that
did
not
think
Bilbo
was
dead
When
they
asked
Where
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
lived
alone
Bilbo
had
done
but
had
good
many
friends
especially
among
the
younger
hobbits
mostly
descen
dants
the
Old
Took
who
had
children
been
fond
Bilbo
and
often
and
out
Bag
End
Folco
Boffin
and
Fredegar
Bolger
were
two
these
but
his
closest
friends
were
Peregrin
Took
usually
called
Pippin
and
Merry
Brandybuck
his
real
name
was
Meriadoc
but
that
was
seldom
remembered
Frodo
went
tramping
over
the
Shire
with
them
but
more
often
wandered
himself
and
the
amazement
sensible
folk
was
sometimes
seen
far
from
home
walking
the
hills
and
woods
under
the
starlight
Merry
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
and
Pippin
suspected
that
visited
the
Elves
times
Bilbo
had
done
time
went
people
began
notice
that
Frodo
also
showed
signs
good
preservation
outwardly
retained
the
appearance
robust
and
energetic
hobbit
just
out
his
tweens
Some
folk
have
all
the
luck
they
said
but
was
not
until
Frodo
approached
the
usually
more
sober
age
fifty
that
they
began
think
queer
Frodo
himself
after
the
first
shock
found
that
being
his
own
master
and
the
Baggins
Bag
End
was
rather
pleasant
For
some
years
was
quite
happy
and
did
not
worry
much
about
the
future
But
half
unknown
himself
the
regret
that
had
not
gone
with
Bilbo
was
steadily
growing
found
himself
wondering
times
especially
the
autumn
about
the
wild
lands
and
strange
visions
mountains
that
had
never
seen
came
into
his
dreams
began
say
himself
Perhaps
shall
cross
the
River
myself
one
day
which
the
other
half
his
mind
always
replied
Not
yet
went
until
his
forties
were
running
out
and
his
fiftieth
birthday
was
drawing
near
fifty
was
number
that
felt
was
some
how
significant
ominous
was
any
rate
that
age
that
adventure
had
suddenly
befallen
Bilbo
Frodo
began
feel
restless
and
the
old
paths
seemed
too
well
trodden
looked
maps
and
wondered
what
lay
beyond
their
edges
maps
made
the
Shire
showed
mostly
white
spaces
beyond
its
borders
took
wandering
further
afield
and
more
often
himself
and
Merry
and
his
other
friends
watched
him
anxiously
Often
was
seen
walking
and
talking
with
the
strange
wayfarers
that
began
this
time
appear
the
Shire
There
were
rumours
strange
things
happening
the
world
outside
and
Gandalf
had
not
that
time
appeared
sent
any
message
for
several
years
Frodo
gathered
all
the
news
could
Elves
who
seldom
walked
the
Shire
could
now
seen
passing
westward
through
the
woods
the
evening
passing
and
not
returning
but
they
were
leaving
Middle
earth
and
were
longer
concerned
with
its
troubles
There
were
however
dwarves
the
road
unusual
numbers
The
ancient
East
West
Road
ran
through
the
Shire
its
end
the
Grey
Havens
and
dwarves
had
always
used
their
way
their
mines
the
Blue
Mountains
They
were
the
hobbits
chief
source
news
from
distant
parts
they
wanted
any
rule
dwarves
said
little
and
hobbits
asked
more
But
now
Frodo
often
met
strange
dwarves
far
countries
seeking
refuge
the
West
They
were
troubled
and
some
spoke
whispers
the
Enemy
and
the
Land
Mordor
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
That
name
the
hobbits
only
knew
legends
the
dark
past
like
shadow
the
background
their
memories
but
was
ominous
and
disquieting
seemed
that
the
evil
power
Mirkwood
had
been
driven
out
the
White
Council
only
reappear
greater
strength
the
old
strongholds
Mordor
The
Dark
Tower
had
been
rebuilt
was
said
From
there
the
power
was
spreading
far
and
wide
and
away
far
east
and
south
there
were
wars
and
growing
fear
Orcs
were
multiplying
again
the
mountains
Trolls
were
abroad
longer
dull
witted
but
cunning
and
armed
with
dreadful
weapons
And
there
were
murmured
hints
creatures
more
terrible
than
all
these
but
they
had
name
Little
all
this
course
reached
the
ears
ordinary
hobbits
But
even
the
deafest
and
most
stay
home
began
hear
queer
tales
and
those
whose
business
took
them
the
borders
saw
strange
things
The
conversation
The
Green
Dragon
Bywater
one
evening
the
spring
Frodo
fiftieth
year
showed
that
even
the
comfort
able
heart
the
Shire
rumours
had
been
heard
though
most
hobbits
still
laughed
them
Sam
Gamgee
was
sitting
one
corner
near
the
fire
and
opposite
him
was
Ted
Sandyman
the
miller
son
and
there
were
various
other
rustic
hobbits
listening
their
talk
Queer
things
you
hear
these
days
sure
said
Sam
said
Ted
you
you
listen
But
can
hear
fireside
tales
and
children
stories
home
want
doubt
you
can
retorted
Sam
and
daresay
there
more
truth
some
them
than
you
reckon
Who
invented
the
stories
anyway
Take
dragons
now
thank
said
Ted
won
heard
tell
them
when
was
youngster
but
there
call
believe
them
now
There
only
one
Dragon
Bywater
and
that
Green
said
getting
general
laugh
All
right
said
Sam
laughing
with
the
rest
But
what
about
these
Tree
men
these
giants
you
might
call
them
They
say
that
one
bigger
than
tree
was
seen
away
beyond
the
North
Moors
not
long
back
Who
they
cousin
Hal
for
one
works
for
Boffin
Overhill
and
goes
the
Northfarthing
for
the
hunting
saw
one
Says
did
perhaps
Your
Hal
always
saying
seen
things
and
maybe
sees
things
that
ain
there
But
this
one
was
big
elm
tree
and
walking
walking
seven
yards
stride
was
inch
Then
bet
wasn
inch
What
saw
was
elm
tree
like
not
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
But
this
one
was
walking
tell
you
and
there
ain
elm
tree
the
North
Moors
Then
Hal
can
have
seen
one
said
Ted
There
was
some
laugh
ing
and
clapping
the
audience
seemed
think
that
Ted
had
scored
point
All
the
same
said
Sam
you
can
deny
that
others
besides
our
Halfast
have
seen
queer
folk
crossing
the
Shire
crossing
mind
you
there
are
more
that
are
turned
back
the
borders
The
Bounders
have
never
been
busy
before
And
heard
tell
that
Elves
are
moving
west
They
say
they
are
going
the
harbours
out
away
beyond
the
White
Towers
Sam
waved
his
arm
vaguely
neither
nor
any
them
knew
how
far
was
the
Sea
past
the
old
towers
beyond
the
western
borders
the
Shire
But
was
old
tradition
that
away
over
there
stood
the
Grey
Havens
from
which
times
elven
ships
set
sail
never
return
They
are
sailing
sailing
sailing
over
the
Sea
they
are
going
into
the
West
and
leaving
said
Sam
half
chanting
the
words
shaking
his
head
sadly
and
solemnly
But
Ted
laughed
Well
that
isn
anything
new
you
believe
the
old
tales
And
don
see
what
matters
you
Let
them
sail
But
warrant
you
haven
seen
them
doing
nor
anyone
else
the
Shire
Well
don
know
said
Sam
thoughtfully
believed
had
once
seen
Elf
the
woods
and
still
hoped
see
more
one
day
all
the
legends
that
had
heard
his
early
years
such
fragments
tales
and
half
remembered
stories
about
the
Elves
the
hobbits
knew
had
always
moved
him
most
deeply
There
are
some
even
these
parts
know
the
Fair
Folk
and
get
news
them
said
There
Baggins
now
that
work
for
told
that
they
were
sailing
and
knows
bit
about
Elves
And
old
Bilbo
knew
more
many
the
talk
had
with
him
when
was
little
lad
they
both
cracked
said
Ted
Leastways
old
Bilbo
was
cracked
and
Frodo
cracking
that
where
you
get
your
news
from
you
never
want
for
moonshine
Well
friends
off
home
Your
good
health
drained
his
mug
and
went
out
noisily
Sam
sat
silent
and
said
more
had
good
deal
think
about
For
one
thing
there
was
lot
the
Bag
End
garden
and
would
have
busy
day
tomorrow
the
weather
cleared
The
grass
was
growing
fast
But
Sam
had
more
his
mind
than
garden
ing
After
while
sighed
and
got
and
went
out
was
early
April
and
the
sky
was
now
clearing
after
heavy
rain
The
sun
was
down
and
cool
pale
evening
was
quietly
fading
into
night
walked
home
under
the
early
stars
through
Hobbiton
and
the
Hill
whistling
softly
and
thoughtfully
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
was
just
this
time
that
Gandalf
reappeared
after
his
long
absence
For
three
years
after
the
Party
had
been
away
Then
paid
Frodo
brief
visit
and
after
taking
good
look
him
went
off
again
During
the
next
year
two
had
turned
fairly
often
coming
unexpectedly
after
dusk
and
going
off
without
warning
before
sunrise
would
not
discuss
his
own
business
and
journeys
and
seemed
chiefly
interested
small
news
about
Frodo
health
and
doings
Then
suddenly
his
visits
had
ceased
was
over
nine
years
since
Frodo
had
seen
heard
him
and
had
begun
think
that
the
wizard
would
never
return
and
had
given
all
interest
hobbits
But
that
evening
Sam
was
walking
home
and
twilight
was
fading
there
came
the
once
familiar
tap
the
study
window
Frodo
welcomed
his
old
friend
with
surprise
and
great
delight
They
looked
hard
one
another
All
well
said
Gandalf
You
look
the
same
ever
Frodo
you
Frodo
replied
but
secretly
thought
that
Gandalf
looked
older
and
more
careworn
pressed
him
for
news
himself
and
the
wide
world
and
soon
they
were
deep
talk
and
they
stayed
far
into
the
night
Next
morning
after
late
breakfast
the
wizard
was
sitting
with
Frodo
the
open
window
the
study
bright
fire
was
the
hearth
but
the
sun
was
warm
and
the
wind
was
the
South
Every
thing
looked
fresh
and
the
new
green
spring
was
shimmering
the
fields
and
the
tips
the
trees
fingers
Gandalf
was
thinking
spring
nearly
eighty
years
before
when
Bilbo
had
run
out
Bag
End
without
handkerchief
His
hair
was
perhaps
whiter
than
had
been
then
and
his
beard
and
eyebrows
were
perhaps
longer
and
his
face
more
lined
with
care
and
wisdom
but
his
eyes
were
bright
ever
and
smoked
and
blew
smoke
rings
with
the
same
vigour
and
delight
was
smoking
now
silence
for
Frodo
was
sitting
still
deep
thought
Even
the
light
morning
felt
the
dark
shadow
the
tidings
that
Gandalf
had
brought
last
broke
the
silence
Last
night
you
began
tell
strange
things
about
ring
Gandalf
said
And
then
you
stopped
because
you
said
that
such
matters
were
best
left
until
daylight
Don
you
think
you
had
better
finish
now
You
say
the
ring
dangerous
far
more
dangerous
than
guess
what
way
many
ways
answered
the
wizard
far
more
powerful
than
ever
dared
think
first
powerful
that
the
end
would

THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
Eregion
long
ago
many
Elven
rings
were
made
magic
rings
you
call
them
and
they
were
course
various
kinds
some
more
potent
and
some
less
The
lesser
rings
were
only
essays
the
craft
before
was
full
grown
and
the
Elven
smiths
they
were
but
trifles
yet
still
mind
dangerous
for
mortals
But
the
Great
Rings
the
Rings
Power
they
were
perilous
mortal
Frodo
who
keeps
one
the
Great
Rings
does
not
die
but
does
not
grow
obtain
more
life
merely
continues
until
last
every
minute
weariness
And
often
uses
the
Ring
make
himself
invisible
fades
becomes
the
end
invisible
permanently
and
walks
the
twilight
under
the
eye
the
Dark
Power
that
rules
the
Rings
Yes
sooner
later
later
strong
well
meaning
begin
with
but
neither
strength
nor
good
purpose
will
last
sooner
later
the
Dark
Power
will
devour
him
How
terrifying
said
Frodo
There
was
another
long
silence
The
sound
Sam
Gamgee
cutting
the
lawn
came
from
the
garden
How
long
have
you
known
this
asked
Frodo
length
And
how
much
did
Bilbo
know
Bilbo
knew
more
than
told
you
sure
said
Gandalf
would
certainly
never
have
passed
you
anything
that
thought
would
danger
even
though
promised
look
after
you
thought
the
ring
was
very
beautiful
and
very
useful
need
and
anything
was
wrong
queer
was
himself
said
that
was
growing
his
mind
and
was
always
worrying
about
but
did
not
suspect
that
the
ring
itself
was
blame
Though
had
found
out
that
the
thing
needed
looking
after
did
not
seem
always
the
same
size
weight
shrank
expanded
odd
way
and
might
suddenly
slip
off
finger
where
had
been
tight
Yes
warned
that
his
last
letter
said
Frodo
have
always
kept
its
chain
Very
wise
said
Gandalf
But
for
his
long
life
Bilbo
never
con
nected
with
the
ring
all
took
all
the
credit
for
that
himself
and
was
very
proud
Though
was
getting
restless
and
uneasy
Thin
and
stretched
said
sign
that
the
ring
was
getting
control
How
long
have
you
known
all
this
asked
Frodo
again
Known
said
Gandalf
have
known
much
that
only
the
Wise
know
Frodo
But
you
mean
known
about
this
ring
well
still
not
know
one
might
say
There
last
test
make
But
longer
doubt
guess
When
did
first
begin
guess
mused
searching
back
memory
Let
see
was
the
year
that
the
White
Council
drove
the
Dark
Power
from
Mirkwood
just
before
the
Battle
Five
Armies
that
Bilbo
found
his
ring
shadow
fell
heart
then
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
though
did
not
know
yet
what
feared
wondered
often
how
Gollum
came
Great
Ring
plainly
was
that
least
was
clear
from
the
first
Then
heard
Bilbo
strange
story
how
had
won
and
could
not
believe
When
last
got
the
truth
out
him
saw
once
that
had
been
trying
put
his
claim
the
ring
beyond
doubt
Much
like
Gollum
with
his
birthday
present
The
lies
were
too
much
alike
for
comfort
Clearly
the
ring
had
unwholesome
power
that
set
work
its
keeper
once
That
was
the
first
real
warning
had
that
all
was
not
well
told
Bilbo
often
that
such
rings
were
better
left
unused
but
resented
and
soon
got
angry
There
was
little
else
that
could
could
not
take
from
him
without
doing
greater
harm
and
had
right
anyway
could
only
watch
and
wait
might
perhaps
have
consulted
Saruman
the
White
but
something
always
held
back
Who
asked
Frodo
have
never
heard
him
before
Maybe
not
answered
Gandalf
Hobbits
are
were
concern
his
Yet
great
among
the
Wise
the
chief
order
and
the
head
the
Council
His
knowledge
deep
but
his
pride
has
grown
with
and
takes
ill
any
meddling
The
lore
the
Elven
rings
great
and
small
his
province
has
long
studied
seeking
the
lost
secrets
their
making
but
when
the
Rings
were
debated
the
Council
all
that
would
reveal
his
ring
lore
told
against
fears
doubt
slept
but
uneasily
Still
watched
and
waited
And
all
seemed
well
with
Bilbo
And
the
years
passed
Yes
they
passed
and
they
seemed
not
touch
him
showed
signs
age
The
shadow
fell
again
But
said
myself
After
all
comes
long
lived
family
his
mother
side
There
time
yet
Wait
And
waited
Until
that
night
when
left
this
house
said
and
did
things
then
that
filled
with
fear
that
words
Saruman
could
allay
knew
last
that
something
dark
and
deadly
was
work
And
have
spent
most
the
years
since
then
finding
out
the
truth
There
wasn
any
permanent
harm
done
was
there
asked
Frodo
anxiously
would
get
all
right
time
wouldn
able
rest
peace
mean
felt
better
once
said
Gandalf
But
there
only
one
Power
this
world
that
knows
all
about
the
Rings
and
their
effects
and
far
know
there
Power
the
world
that
knows
all
about
hobbits
Among
the
Wise
the
only
one
that
goes
for
hobbit
lore
obscure
branch
knowledge
but
full
surprises
Soft
butter
they
can
and
yet
sometimes
tough

likely
that
some
would
resist
the
Rings
far
longer
than

THE

important

was
not

about

Bilbo
any

Ever
since
Bilbo

been
deeply

Frodo
shuddered
But
why
should
asked
And
why
should
want
such
slaves
tell
you
the
truth
replied
Gandalf
believe
that
hitherto
hitherto

entirely
overlooked
the

hobbits
You
should
thankful
But
your

but
won

you
again
And
hobbits
miserable

would
please
him
far
more
than
hobbits
happy
and
free
There
such
thing
malice
and
revenge
Revenge
said
Frodo
Revenge
for
what
still
don
understand
what
all
this
has
with
Bilbo
and
myself
and
our
ring
has
everything
with
said
Gandalf
You
not
know
the
real
peril
yet
but
you
shall
was
not
sure
myself
when
was
last
here
but
the
time
has
come
speak
Give
the
ring
for
moment
Frodo
took
from
his
breeches
pocket
where
was
clasped
chain
that
hung
from
his
belt
unfastened
and
handed
slowly
the
wizard
felt
suddenly
very
heavy
either
Frodo
himself
was
some
way
reluctant
for
Gandalf
touch
Gandalf
held
looked
made
pure
and
solid
gold
Can
you
see
any
markings
asked
said
Frodo
There
are
none
quite
plain
and
never
shows
scratch
sign
wear
Well
then
look
Frodo
astonishment
and
distress
the
wizard
threw
suddenly
into
the
middle
glowing
corner
the
fire
Frodo
gave
cry
and
groped
for
the
tongs
but
Gandalf
held
him
back
Wait
said
commanding
voice
giving
Frodo
quick
look
from
under
his
bristling
brows
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
apparent
change
came
over
the
ring
After
while
Gandalf
got
closed
the
shutters
outside
the
window
and
drew
the
curtains
The
room
became
dark
and
silent
though
the
clack
Sam
shears
now
nearer
the
windows
could
still
heard
faintly
from
the
garden
For
moment
the
wizard
stood
looking
the
fire
then
stooped
and
removed
the
ring
the
hearth
with
the
tongs
and
once
picked
Frodo
gasped
quite
cool
said
Gandalf
Take
Frodo
received
his
shrinking
palm
seemed
have
become
thicker
and
heavier
than
ever
Hold
said
Gandalf
And
look
closely
Frodo
did
now
saw
fine
lines
finer
than
the
finest
pen
strokes
running
along
the
ring
outside
and
inside
lines
fire
that
seemed
form
the
letters
flowing
script
They
shone
piercingly
bright
and
yet
remote
out
great
depth
Come
thy
Lach
cannot
read
the
fiery
letters
said
Frodo
quavering
voice
said
Gandalf
but
can
The
letters
are
Elvish
ancient
mode
but
the
language
that
Mordor
which
will
not
utter
here
But
this
the
Common

what
said
close
enough

This

THE

THE

that

the
great
weakening

Frodo
sat
silent
and
motionless
Fear
seemed
stretch
out
vast
hand
like
dark
cloud
rising
the
East
and
looming
engulf
him
This
ring
stammered
How
how
earth
did
come
said
Gandalf
That
very
long
story
The
beginnings
lie
back
the
Black
Years
which
only
the
lore
masters
now
remember
were
tell
you
all
that
tale
should
still
sitting
here
when
Spring
had
passed
into
Winter
But
last
night
told
you
Sauron
the
Great
the
Dark
Lord
The
rumours
that
you
have
heard
are
true
has
indeed
arisen
again
and
left
his
hold
Mirkwood
and
returned
his
ancient
fastness
the
Dark
Tower
Mordor
That
name
even
you
hobbits
have
heard
like
shadow
the
borders
old
stories
Always
after
defeat
and
respite
the
Shadow
takes
another
shape
and
grows
again
wish
need
not
have
happened
time
said
Frodo
said
Gandalf
and
all
who
live
see
such
times
But
that
not
for
them
decide
All
have
decide
what
with
the
time
that
given
And
already
Frodo
our
time
beginning
look
black
The
Enemy
fast
becoming
very
strong
His
plans
are
far
from
ripe
think
but
they
are
ripening
shall
hard
put
should
very
hard
put
even
were
not
for
this
dreadful
chance
The
Enemy
still
lacks
one
thing
give
him
strength
and
know
ledge
beat
down
all
resistance
break
the
last
defences
and
cover
all
the

second
darkness
lacks
the
One
Ring
The
Three
fairest
all
the
Elf
lords
hid
from
him
and
his
hand
never
touched
them
sullied
them
Seven
the
Dwarf
kings
possessed
but
three
has
recovered
and
the
others
the
dragons
have
consumed
Nine
gave
Mortal
Men
proud
and
great
and
ensnared
them
Long
ago
they
fell
under
the
dominion
the
One
and
they
became
Ringwraiths
shadows
under
his
great
Shadow
his
most
terrible
servants
Long
ago
many
year
since
the
Nine
walked
abroad
Yet
who
knows
the
Shadow
grows
once
more
they
too
may
walk
again
But
come
will
not
speak
such
things
even
the
morning
the
Shire
now
the
Nine
has
gathered
himself
the
Seven
also
else
they
are
destroyed
The
Three
are
hidden
still
But
that
longer
troubles
him
only
needs
the
One
for
made
that
Ring
himself

and
let
great
part
his
own
former
power

the
others

then
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
will
command
them
all
again
wherever
they
even
the
Three
and
all
that
has
been
wrought
with
them
will
laid
bare
and
will
stronger
than
ever
And
this
the
dreadful
chance
Frodo
believed
that
the
One
had
perished
that
the
Elves
had
destroyed
should
have
been
done
But
knows
now
that
has
perished
that
has
been
found
seeking
seeking
and
all
his
thought
bent
his
great
hope
and
our
great
fear
Why
why
wasn
destroyed
cried
Frodo
And
how
did
the
Enemy
ever
come
lose
was
strong
and
was
precious
him
clutched
the
Ring
his
hand
saw
already
dark
fingers
stretching
out
seize
was
taken
from
him
said
Gandalf
The
strength
the
Elves
resist
him
was
greater
long
ago
and
not
all
Men
were
estranged
from
them
The
Men
Westernesse
came
their
aid
That
chapter
ancient
history
which
might
good
recall
for
there
was
sorrow
then
too
and
gathering
dark
but
great
valour
and
great
deeds
that
were
not
wholly
vain
One
day
perhaps
will
tell
you
all
the
tale
you
shall
hear
told
full
one
who
knows
best
But
for
the
moment
since
most
all
you
need
know
how
this
thing
came
you
and
that
will
tale
enough
this
all
that
will
say
was
Gil
galad
Elven
king
and
Elendil
Westernesse
who
overthrew
Sauron
though
they
themselves
perished
the
deed
and
Isildur
Elendil
son
cut
the
Ring
from
Sauron
hand
and
took
for
his
own
Then
Sauron
was
vanquished
and
his
spirit
fled
and
was
hidden
for
long
years
until
his
shadow
took
shape
again
Mirkwood
But
the
Ring
was
lost
fell
into
the
Great
River
Anduin
and
vanished
For
Isildur
was
marching
north
along
the
east
banks
the
River
and
near
the
Gladden
Fields
was
waylaid
the
Orcs
the
Mountains
and
almost
all
his
folk
were
slain
leaped
into
the
waters
but
the
Ring
slipped
from
his
finger
swam
and
then
the
Orcs
saw
him
and
killed
him
with
arrows
Gandalf
paused
And
there
the
dark
pools
amid
the
Gladden
Fields
said
the
Ring
passed
out
knowledge
and
legend
and
even
much
its
history
known
now
only
few
and
the
Council
the
Wise
could
discover
more
But
last
can
carry
the
story
think
Long
after
but
still
very
long
ago
there
lived
the
banks
the
Great
River
the
edge
Wilderland
clever
handed
and
quiet
footed
little
people
guess
they
were
hobbit
kind
akin
the
fathers
the
fathers
the
Stoors
for
they
loved
the
River
and
often
swam
made
little
boats
reeds
There
was
among
them
THE

THE
PAST
family

for

large
and
wealthier
than
most
and
was

the

The
most
inquisitive
and
curious
minded
that

called
Sméagol
was
interested

and

dived
into
deep
pools
burrowed
under
trees
and
growing
plants
tunnelled
into
green
mounds
and
ceased

the
hill
tops
the
leaves

the
flowers
opening
the
air
his
head
and
his
eyes
were
downward
had
friend
called
Déagol
similar
sort
sharper
eyed
but
not
quick
and
strong
time
they
took
boat
and
went
down
the
Gladden
Fields
where
there
were
great
beds
iris
and
flower
ing
reeds
There
Sméagol
got
out
and
went
nosing
about
the
banks
but
Déagol
sat
the
boat
and
fished
Suddenly
great
fish
took
his
hook
and
before
knew
where
was
was
dragged
out
and
down
into
the
water
the
bottom
Then
let
his
line
for
thought
saw
something
shining
the
river
bed
and
holding
his
breath
grabbed
Then
came
spluttering
with
weeds
his
hair
and
handful
mud
and
swam
the
bank
And
behold
when
washed
the
mud
away
there
his
hand
lay
beautiful
golden
ring
and
shone
and
glittered
the
sun
that
his
heart
was
glad
But
Sméagol
had
been
watching
him
from
behind
tree
and
Déagol
gloated
over
the
ring
Sméagol
came
softly
behind
Give
that
Déagol
love
said
Sméagol
over
his
friend
shoulder
Why
said
Déagol
Because
birthday
love
and
wants
said
Sméagol
don
care
said
Déagol
have
given
you
present
already
more
than
could
afford
found
this
and
going
keep
are
you
indeed
love
said
Sméagol
and
caught
Déagol
the
throat
and
strangled
him
because
the
gold
looked
bright
and
beautiful
Then
put
the
ring
his
finger
one
ever
found
out
what
had
become
Déagol
was
murdered
far
from
home
and
his
body
was
cunningly
hidden
But
Sméagol
returned
alone
and
found
that
none
his
family
could
see
him
when
was
wearing
the
ring
was
very
pleased
with
his
discovery
and
concealed
and
used
find
out
secrets
and
put
his
knowledge
crooked
and
malicious
uses
became
sharp
eyed
and
keen
eared
for
all
that
was
hurtful
The
ring
had
given
him
power
according
his
stature
not
wondered
that
became
very
unpopular
and
was
shunned
when
visible
all
his
relations
They
kicked
him
and
bit
their
feet
took
thieving
and
going
about
muttering
himself
and
gurgling
his
throat
they
called
him
Gollum
and
cursed
him
and
told
him
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
far
away
and
his
grandmother
desiring
peace
expelled
him
from
the
family
and
turned
him
out
her
hole
wandered
loneliness
weeping
little
for
the
hardness
the
world
and
journeyed
the
River
till
came
stream
that
flowed
down
from
the
mountains
and
went
that
way
caught
fish
deep
pools
with
invisible
fingers
and
ate
them
raw
One
day
was
very
hot
and
was
bending
over
pool
felt
burning
the
back
his
head
and
dazzling
light
from
the
water
pained
his
wet
eyes
wondered
for
had
almost
forgotten
about
the
Sun
Then
for
the
last
time
looked
and
shook
his
fist
her
But
lowered
his
eyes
saw
far
ahead
the
tops
the
Misty
Mountains
out
which
the
stream
came
And
thought
suddenly
would
cool
and
shady
under
those
mountains
The
Sun
could
not
watch
there
The
roots
those
mountains
must
roots
indeed
there
must
great
secrets
buried
there
which
have
not
been
discovered
since
the
beginning
journeyed
night
into
the
highlands
and
found
little
cave
out
which
the
dark
stream
ran
and
wormed
his
way
like
maggot
into
the
heart
the
hills
and
vanished
out
all
knowledge
The
Ring
went
into
the
shadows
with
him
and
even
the
maker
when
his
power
had
begun
grow
again
could
learn
nothing
Gollum
cried
Frodo
Gollum
you
mean
that
this
the
very
Gollum
creature
that
Bilbo
met
How
loathsome
think
sad
story
said
the
wizard
and
might
have
happened
others
even
some
hobbits
that
have
known
can
believe
that
Gollum
was
connected
with
hobbits
however
distantly
said
Frodo
with
some
heat
What
abominable
notion
true
all
the
same
replied
Gandalf
About
their
origins
any
rate
know
more
than
hobbits
themselves
And
even
Bilbo
story
suggests
the
kinship
There
was
great
deal
the
background
their
minds
and
memories
that
was
very
similar
They
understood
one
another
remarkably
well
very
much
better
than
hobbit
would
understand
say
Dwarf
Orc
even
Elf
Think
the
riddles
they
both
knew
for
one
thing
Yes
said
Frodo
Though
other
folks
besides
hobbits
ask
riddles
and
much
the
same
sort
And
hobbits
don
cheat
Gollum
meant
cheat
all
the
time
was
just
trying
put
poor
Bilbo
off
his
guard
And
daresay
amused
his
wickedness
start
game
which
might
end
providing
him
with
easy
victim
but
lost
would
not
hurt
him
Only
too
true
fear
said
Gandalf
But
there
was
something
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
else
think
which
you
don
see
yet
Even
Gollum
was
not
wholly
ruined
had
proved
tougher
than
even
one
the
Wise
would
have
guessed
hobbit
might
There
was
little
corner
his
mind
that
was
still
his
own
and
light
came
through
through
chink
the
dark
light
out
the
past
was
actually
pleasant
think
hear
kindly
voice
again
bringing
memories
wind
and
trees
and
sun
the
grass
and
such
forgotten
things
But
that
course
would
only
make
the
evil
part
him
angrier
the
end
unless
could
conquered
Unless
could
cured
Gandalf
sighed
Alas
there
little
hope
that
for
him
Yet
not
hope
not
though
possessed
the
Ring
long
almost
far
back
can
remember
For
was
long
since
had
worn
much
the
black
darkness
was
seldom
needed
Certainly
had
never
faded
thin
and
tough
still
But
the
thing
was
eating
his
mind
course
and
the
torment
had
become
almost
unbearable
All
the
great
secrets
under
the
mountains
had
turned
out
just
empty
night
there
was
nothing
more
find
out
nothing
worth
doing
only
nasty
furtive
eating
and
resentful
remembering
was
altogether
wretched
hated
the
dark
and
hated
light
more
hated
everything
and
the
Ring
most
all
What
you
mean
said
Frodo
Surely
the
Ring
was
his
Precious
and
the
only
thing
cared
for
But
hated
why
didn
get
rid
away
and
leave
You
ought
begin
understand
Frodo
after
all
you
have
heard
said
Gandalf
hated
and
loved
hated
and
loved
himself
could
not
get
rid
had
will
left
the
matter
Ring
Power
looks
after
itself
Frodo
may
slip
off
treacher
ously
but
its
keeper
never
abandons
most
plays
with
the
idea
handing
someone
else
care
and
that
only
early
stage
when
first
begins
grip
But
far
know
Bilbo
alone
history
has
ever
gone
beyond
playing
and
really
done
needed
all
help
too
And
even
would
never
have
just
forsaken
cast
aside
was
not
Gollum
Frodo
but
the
Ring
itself
that
decided
things
The
Ring
left
him
What
just
time
meet
Bilbo
said
Frodo
Wouldn
Orc
have
suited
better
laughing
matter
said
Gandalf
Not
for
you
was
the
strangest
event
the
whole
history
the
Ring
far
Bilbo
arrival
just
that
time
and
putting
his
hand
blindly
the
dark
There
was
more
than
one
power
work
Frodo
The
Ring
was
trying
get
back
its
master
had
slipped
from
Isildur
hand
and
betrayed
him
then
when
chance
came
caught
poor
Déagol
and
was
murdered
and
after
that
Gollum
and
had
devoured
him
could
make
further
use
him
was
too
small
and
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
mean
and
long
stayed
with
him
would
never
leave
his
deep
pool
again
now
when
its
master
was
awake
once
more
and
sending
out
his
dark
thought
from
Mirkwood
abandoned
Gollum
Only
picked
the
most
unlikely
person
imaginable
Bilbo
from
the
Shire
Behind
that
there
was
something
else
work
beyond
any
design
the
Ring
maker
can
put
plainer
than
saying
that
Bilbo
was
meant
find
the
Ring
and
not
its
maker
which
case
you
also
were
meant
have
And
that
may
encouraging
thought
not
said
Frodo
Though
not
sure
that
understand
you
But
how
have
you
learned
all
this
about
the
Ring
and
about
Gollum
you
really
know
all
are
you
just
guessing
still
Gandalf
looked
Frodo
and
his
eyes
glinted
knew
much
and
have
learned
much
answered
But
not
going
give
account
all
doings
you
The
history
Elendil
and
Isildur
and
the
One
Ring
known
all
the
Wise
Your
ring
shown
that
One
Ring
the
fire
writing
alone
apart
from
any
other
evidence
And
when
did
you
discover
that
asked
Frodo
interrupting
Just
now
this
room
course
answered
the
wizard
sharply
But
expected
find
have
come
back
from
dark
journeys
and
long
search
make
that
final
test
the
last
proof
and
all
now
only
too
clear
Making
out
Gollum
part
and
fitting
into
the
gap
the
history
required
some
thought
may
have
started
with
guesses
about
Gollum
but
not
guessing
now
know
have
seen
him
You
have
seen
Gollum
exclaimed
Frodo
amazement
Yes
The
obvious
thing
course
one
could
tried
long
ago
but
have
managed
last
Then
what
happened
after
Bilbo
escaped
from
him
you
know
that
Not
clearly
What
have
told
you
what
Gollum
was
willing
tell
though
not
course
the
way
have
reported
Gollum
liar
and
you
have
sift
his
words
For
instance
called
the
Ring
his
birthday
present
and
stuck
that
said
came
from
his
grandmother
who
had
lots
beautiful
things
that
kind
ridiculous
story
have
doubt
that
Sméagol
grandmother
was
matriarch
great
person
her
way
but
talk
her
possessing
many
Elven
rings
was
absurd
and
for
giving
them
away
was
lie
But
lie
with
grain
truth
The
murder
Déagol
haunted
Gollum
and
had
made
defence
repeating
his
Precious
over
and
over
again
gnawed
bones
the
dark
until
almost
believed
was
his
birthday
Déagol
ought
have
given
the
ring
him
had
obviously
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
turned
just
present
was
his
birthday
present
and
and
endured
him
long
could
but
the
truth
was
desperately
important
and
the
end
had
harsh
put
the
fear
fire
him
and
wrung
the
true
story
out
him
bit
bit
together
with
much
snivelling
and
snarling
thought
was
misunderstood
and
ill
used
But
when
had
last
told
his
history
far
the
end
the
Riddle
game
and
Bilbo
escape
would
not
say
any
more
except
dark
hints
Some
other
fear
was
him
greater
than
mine
muttered
that
was
going
get
his
own
back
People
would
see
would
stand
being
kicked
and
driven
into
hole
and
then
robbed
Gollum
had
good
friends
now
good
friends
and
very
strong
They
would
help
him
Baggins
would
pay
for
That
was
his
chief
thought
hated
Bilbo
and
cursed
his
name
What
more
knew
where
came
from
But
how
did
find
that
out
asked
Frodo
Well
for
the
name
Bilbo
very
foolishly
told
Gollum
himself
and
after
that
would
not
difficult
discover
his
country
once
Gollum
came
out
yes
came
out
His
longing
for
the
Ring
proved
stronger
than
his
fear
the
Orcs
even
the
light
After
year
two
left
the
mountains
You
see
though
still
bound
desire
the
Ring
was
longer
devouring
him
began
revive
little
felt
old
terribly
old
yet
less
timid
and
was
mortally
hungry
Light
light
Sun
and
Moon
still
feared
and
hated
and
always
will
think
but
was
cunning
found
could
hide
from
daylight
and
moonshine
and
make
his
way
swiftly
and
softly
dead
night
with
his
pale
cold
eyes
and
catch
small
frightened
unwary
things
grew
stronger
and
bolder
with
new
food
and
new
air
found
his
way
into
Mirkwood
one
would
expect
that
where
you
found
him
asked
Frodo
saw
him
there
answered
Gandalf
but
before
that
had
wan
dered
far
following
Bilbo
trail
was
difficult
learn
anything
from
him
for
certain
for
his
talk
was
constantly
interrupted
curses
and
threats
What
had
got
its
pocketses
said
wouldn
say
precious
Little
cheat
Not
fair
question
cheated
first
did
broke
the
rules
ought
have
squeezed
yes
precious
And
will
precious
That
sample
his
talk
don
suppose
you
want
any
more
had
weary
days
But
from
hints
dropped
among
the
snarls
gathered
that
his
padding
feet
had
taken
him
last
Esgaroth
and
even
the
streets
Dale
listening
secretly
and
peering
Well
the
news
the
great
events
went
far
and
wide
Wilderland
and
many
had
heard
Bilbo
name
and
knew
where
came
from
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
had
made
secret
our
return
journey
his
home
the
West
Gollum
sharp
ears
would
soon
learn
what
wanted
Then
why
didn
track
Bilbo
further
asked
Frodo
Why
didn
come
the
Shire
said
Gandalf
now
come
think
Gollum
tried
set
out
and
came
back
westward
far
the
Great
River
But
then
turned
aside
was
not
daunted
the
distance
sure
something
else
drew
him
away
friends
think
those
that
hunted
him
for
The
Wood
elves
tracked
him
first
easy
task
for
them
for
his
trail
was
still
fresh
then
Through
Mirkwood
and
back
again
led
them
though
they
never
caught
him
The
wood
was
full
the
rumour
him
dreadful
tales
even
among
beasts
and
birds
The
Woodmen
said
that
there
was
some
new
terror
abroad
ghost
that
drank
blood
climbed
trees
find
nests
crept
into
holes
find
the
young
slipped
through
windows
find
cradles
But
the
western
edge
Mirkwood
the
trail
turned
away
wandered
off
southwards
and
passed
out
the
Wood
elves
ken
and
was
lost
And
then
made
great
mistake
Yes
Frodo
and
not
the
first
though
fear
may
prove
the
worst
let
the
matter
let
him
for
had
much
else
think
that
time
and
still
trusted
the
lore
Saruman
Well
that
was
years
ago
have
paid
for
since
with
many
dark
and
dangerous
days
The
trail
was
long
cold
when
took
again
after
Bilbo
left
here
And
search
would
have
been
vain
but
for
the
help
that
had
from
friend
Aragorn
the
greatest
traveller
and
huntsman
this
age
the
world
Together
sought
for
Gollum
down
the
whole
length
Wilderland
without
hope
and
without
success
But
last
when
had
given
the
chase
and
turned
other
paths
Gollum
was
found
friend
returned
out
great
perils
bringing
the
miserable
creature
with
him
What
had
been
doing
would
not
say
only
wept
and
called
cruel
with
many
gollum
his
throat
and
when
pressed
him
whined
and
cringed
and
rubbed
his
long
hands
licking
his
fingers
they
pained
him
remembered
some
old
torture
But
afraid
there
possible
doubt
had
made
his
slow
sneaking
way
step
step
mile
mile
south
down
last
the
Land
Mordor
heavy
silence
fell
the
room
Frodo
could
hear
his
heart
beating
Even
outside
everything
seemed
still
sound
Sam
shears
could
now
heard
Yes
Mordor
said
Gandalf
Alas
Mordor
draws
all
wicked
things
and
the
Dark
Power
was
bending
all
its
will
gather
them
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
there
The
Ring
the
Enemy
would
leave
its
mark
too
leave
him
open
the
summons
And
all
folk
were
whispering
then
the
new
Shadow
the
South
and
its
hatred
the
West
There
were
his
fine
new
friends
who
would
help
him
his
revenge
Wretched
fool
that
land
would
learn
much
too
much
for
his
comfort
And
sooner
later
lurked
and
pried
the
borders
would
caught
and
taken
for
examination
That
was
the
way
fear
When
was
found
had
already
been
there
long
and
was
his
way
back
some
errand
mischief
But
that
does
not
matter
much
now
His
worst
mischief
was
done
Yes
alas
through
him
the
Enemy
has
learned
that
the
One
has
been
found
again
knows
where
Isildur
fell
knows
where
Gollum
found
his
ring
knows
that
Great
Ring
for
gave
long
life
knows
that
not
one
the
Three
for
they
have
never
been
lost
and
they
endure
evil
knows
that
not
one
the
Seven
the
Nine
for
they
are
accounted
for
knows
that
the
One
And
has
last
heard
think
hobbits
and
the
Shire
The
Shire
may
seeking
for
now
has
not
already
found
out
where
lies
Indeed
Frodo
fear
that
may
even
think
that
the
long
unnoticed
name
Baggins
has
become
important
But
this
terrible
cried
Frodo
Far
worse
than
the
worst
that
imagined
from
your
hints
and
warnings
Gandalf
best
friends
what
For
now
really
afraid
What
What
pity
that
Bilbo
did
not
stab
that
vile
creature
when
had
chance
Pity
was
Pity
that
stayed
his
hand
Pity
and
Mercy
not
strike
without
need
And
has
been
well
rewarded
Frodo
sure
that
took
little
hurt
from
the
evil
and
escaped
the
end
because
began
his
ownership
the
Ring
With
Pity
sorry
said
Frodo
But
frightened
and
not
feel
any
pity
for
Gollum
You
have
not
seen
him
Gandalf
broke
and
don
want
said
Frodo
can
understand
you
you
mean
say
that
you
and
the
Elves
have
let
him
live
after
all
those
horrible
deeds
Now
any
rate
bad
Orc
and
just
enemy
deserves
death
Deserves
daresay
does
Many
that
live
deserve
death
And
some
that
die
deserve
life
Can
you
give
them
Then
not
too
eager
deal
out
death
judgement
For
even
the
very
wise
cannot
see
all
ends
have
not
much
hope
that
Gollum
can
cured
before
dies
but
there
chance
And
bound
with
the
fate
the
Ring
heart
tells
that
has
some
part
play
yet
for
good
ill
before
the
end
and
when
that
comes
the
pity
Bilbo
may
rule
the
fate
many
yours
not
least
any
case
did
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
not
kill
him
very
old
and
very
wretched
The
Wood
elves
have
him
prison
but
they
treat
him
with
such
kindness
they
can
find
their
wise
hearts
All
the
same
said
Frodo
even
Bilbo
could
not
kill
Gollum
wish
had
not
kept
the
Ring
wish
had
never
found
and
that
had
not
got
Why
did
you
let
keep
Why
didn
you
make
throw
away
destroy
Let
you
Make
you
said
the
wizard
Haven
you
been
listening
all
that
have
said
You
are
not
thinking
what
you
are
saying
But
for
throwing
away
that
was
obviously
wrong
These
Rings
have
way
being
found
evil
hands
might
have
done
great
evil
Worst
all
might
have
fallen
into
the
hands
the
Enemy
Indeed
certainly
would
for
this
the
One
and
exerting
all
his
power
find
draw
himself
course
dear
Frodo
was
dangerous
for
you
and
that
has
troubled
deeply
But
there
was
much
stake
that
had
take
some
risk
though
even
when
was
far
away
there
has
never
been
day
when
the
Shire
has
not
been
guarded
watchful
eyes
long
you
never
used
did
not
think
that
the
Ring
would
have
any
lasting
effect
you
not
for
evil
not
any
rate
for
very
long
time
And
you
must
remember
that
nine
years
ago
when
last
saw
you
still
knew
little
for
certain
But
why
not
destroy
you
say
should
have
been
done
long
ago
cried
Frodo
again
you
had
warned
even
sent
message
would
have
done
away
with
Would
you
How
would
you
that
Have
you
ever
tried
But
suppose
one
could
hammer
melt
Try
said
Gandalf
Try
now
Frodo
drew
the
Ring
out
his
pocket
again
and
looked
now
appeared
plain
and
smooth
without
mark
device
that
could
see
The
gold
looked
very
fair
and
pure
and
Frodo
thought
how
rich
and
beautiful
was
its
colour
how
perfect
was
its
roundness
was
admirable
thing
and
altogether
precious
When
took
out
had
intended
fling
from
him
into
the
very
hottest
part
the
fire
But
found
now
that
could
not
not
without
great
struggle
weighed
the
Ring
his
hand
hesitating
and
forcing
himself
remember
all
that
Gandalf
had
told
him
and
then
with
effort
will
made
movement
cast
away
but
found
that
had
put
back
his
pocket
Gandalf
laughed
grimly
You
see
Already
you
too
Frodo
cannot
easily
let
nor
will
damage
And
could
not
make
you
except
force
which
would
break
your
mind
But
for
breaking
the
Ring
force
useless
Even
you
took
and
struck
with
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
heavy
sledge
hammer
would
make
dint
cannot
unmade
your
hands
mine
Your
small
fire
course
would
not
melt
even
ordinary
gold
This
Ring
has
already
passed
through
unscathed
and
even
unheated
But
there
smith
forge
this
Shire
that
could
change
all
Not
even
the
anvils
and
furnaces
the
Dwarves
could
that
has
been
said
that
dragon
fire
could
melt
and
consume
the
Rings
Power
but
there
not
now
any
dragon
left
earth
which
the
old
fire
hot
enough
nor
was
there
ever
any
dragon
not
even
Ancalagon
the
Black
who
could
have
harmed
the
One
Ring
the
Ruling
Ring
for
that
was
made
Sauron
himself
There
only
one
way
find
the
Cracks
Doom
the
depths
Orodruin
the
Fire
mountain
and
cast
the
Ring
there
you
really
wish
destroy
put
beyond
the
grasp
the
Enemy
for
ever
really
wish
destroy
cried
Frodo
well
have
destroyed
not
made
for
perilous
quests
wish
had
never
seen
the
Ring
Why
did
come
Why
was
chosen
Such
questions
cannot
answered
said
Gandalf
You
may
sure
that
was
not
for
any
merit
that
others
not
possess
not
for
power
wisdom
any
rate
But
you
have
been
chosen
and
you
must
therefore
use
such
strength
and
heart
and
wits
you
have
But
have
little
any
these
things
You
are
wise
and
powerful
Will
you
not
take
the
Ring
cried
Gandalf
springing
his
feet
With
that
power
should
have
power
too
great
and
terrible
And
over
the
Ring
would
gain
power
still
greater
and
more
deadly
His
eyes
flashed
and
his
face
was
lit
fire
within
not
tempt
For
not
wish
become
like
the
Dark
Lord
himself
Yet
the
way
the
Ring
heart
pity
pity
for
weakness
and
the
desire
strength
good
not
tempt
dare
not
take
not
even
keep
safe
unused
The
wish
wield
would
too
great
for
strength
shall
have
such
need
Great
perils
lie
before
went
the
window
and
drew
aside
the
curtains
and
the
shut
ters
Sunlight
streamed
back
again
into
the
room
Sam
passed
along
the
path
outside
whistling
And
now
said
the
wizard
turning
back
Frodo
the
decision
lies
with
you
But
will
always
help
you
laid
his
hand
Frodo
shoulder
will
help
you
bear
this
burden
long
yours
bear
But
must
something
soon
The
Enemy
moving
There
was
long
silence
Gandalf
sat
down
again
and
puffed
his
pipe
lost
thought
His
eyes
seemed
closed
but
under
the
lids
was
watching
Frodo
intently
Frodo
gazed
fixedly
the
red
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
embers
the
hearth
until
they
filled
all
his
vision
and
seemed
looking
down
into
profound
wells
fire
was
thinking
the
fabled
Cracks
Doom
and
the
terror
the
Fiery
Mountain
Well
said
Gandalf
last
What
are
you
thinking
about
Have
you
decided
what
answered
Frodo
coming
back
himself
out
darkness
and
finding
his
surprise
that
was
not
dark
and
that
out
the
window
could
see
the
sunlit
garden
perhaps
yes
far
understand
what
you
have
said
suppose
must
keep
the
Ring
and
guard
least
for
the
present
whatever
may
Whatever
may
will
slow
slow
evil
you
keep
with
that
purpose
said
Gandalf
hope
said
Frodo
But
hope
that
you
may
find
some
other
better
keeper
soon
But
the
meanwhile
seems
that
danger
danger
all
that
live
near
cannot
keep
the
Ring
and
stay
here
ought
leave
Bag
End
leave
the
Shire
leave
everything
and
away
sighed
should
like
save
the
Shire
could
though
there
have
been
times
when
thought
the
inhabitants
too
stupid
and
dull
for
words
and
have
felt
that
earthquake
invasion
dragons
might
good
for
them
But
don
feel
like
that
now
feel
that
long
the
Shire
lies
behind
safe
and
comfortable
shall
find
wandering
more
bearable
shall
know
that
somewhere
there
firm
foothold
even
feet
cannot
stand
there
again
course
have
sometimes
thought
going
away
but
imag
ined
that
kind
holiday
series
adventures
like
Bilbo
better
ending
peace
But
this
would
mean
exile
flight
from
danger
into
danger
drawing
after
And
suppose
must
alone
that
and
save
the
Shire
But
feel
very
small
and
very
uprooted
and
well
desperate
The
Enemy
strong
and
terrible
did
not
tell
Gandalf
but
was
speaking
great
desire
follow
Bilbo
flamed
his
heart
follow
Bilbo
and
even
perhaps
find
him
again
was
strong
that
overcame
his
fear
could
almost
have
run
out
there
and
then
down
the
road
without
his
hat
Bilbo
had
done
similar
morning
long
ago
dear
Frodo
exclaimed
Gandalf
Hobbits
really
are
amazing
creatures
have
said
before
You
can
learn
all
that
there
know
about
their
ways
month
and
yet
after
hundred
years
they
can
still
surprise
you
pinch
hardly
expected
get
such
answer
not
even
from
you
But
Bilbo
made
mistake
choosing
his
heir
though
little
thought
how
important
would
prove
afraid
you
are
right
The
Ring
will
not
able
stay
hidden
the
Shire
much
longer
and
for
your
own
sake
well
for
others
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
you
will
have
and
leave
the
name
Baggins
behind
you
That
name
will
not
safe
have
outside
the
Shire
the
Wild
will
give
you
travelling
name
now
When
you
Underhill
But
don
think
you
need
alone
Not
you
know
anyone
you
can
trust
and
who
would
willing
your
side
and
that
you
would
willing
take
into
unknown
perils
But
you
look
for
companion
careful
choosing
And
careful
what
you
say
even
your
closest
friends
The
enemy
has
many
spies
and
many
ways
hearing
Suddenly
stopped
listening
Frodo
became
aware
that
all
was
very
quiet
inside
and
outside
Gandalf
crept
one
side
the
window
Then
with
dart
sprang
the
sill
and
thrust
long
arm
out
and
downwards
There
was
squawk
and
came
Sam
Gamgee
curly
head
hauled
one
ear
Well
well
bless
beard
said
Gandalf
Sam
Gamgee
Now
what
may
you
doing
Lor
bless
you
Gandalf
sir
said
Sam
Nothing
Leastways
was
just
trimming
the
grass
border
under
the
window
you
follow
picked
his
shears
and
exhibited
them
evidence
don
said
Gandalf
grimly
some
time
since
last
heard
the
sound
your
shears
How
long
have
you
been
eavesdropping
Eavesdropping
sir
don
follow
you
begging
your
pardon
There
ain
eaves
Bag
End
and
that
fact
Don
fool
What
have
you
heard
and
why
did
you
listen
Gandalf
eyes
flashed
and
his
brows
stuck
out
like
bristles
Frodo
sir
cried
Sam
quaking
Don
let
him
hurt
sir
Don
let
him
turn
into
anything
unnatural
old
dad
would
take
meant
harm
honour
sir
won
hurt
you
said
Frodo
hardly
able
keep
from
laughing
although
was
himself
startled
and
rather
puzzled
knows
well
that
you
mean
harm
But
just
you
and
answer
his
questions
straight
away
Well
sir
said
Sam
dithering
little
heard
deal
that
didn
rightly
understand
about
enemy
and
rings
and
Bilbo
sir
and
dragons
and
fiery
mountain
and
and
Elves
sir
listened
because
couldn
help
myself
you
know
what
mean
Lor
bless
sir
but
love
tales
that
sort
And
believe
them
too
whatever
Ted
may
say
Elves
sir
would
dearly
love
see
them
Couldn
you
take
see
Elves
sir
when
you
Suddenly
Gandalf
laughed
Come
inside
shouted
and
putting
out
both
his
arms
lifted
the
astonished
Sam
shears
grass
clippings
and
all
right
through
the
window
and
stood
him
the
floor
Take
you
see
Elves
said
eyeing
Sam
closely
but
with
smile
flickering
his
face
you
heard
that
Frodo
going
away
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
did
sir
And
that
why
choked
which
you
heard
seemingly
tried
not
sir
but
burst
out
was
upset
can
helped
Sam
said
Frodo
sadly
had
suddenly
realized
that
flying
from
the
Shire
would
mean
more
painful
partings
than
merely
saying
farewell
the
familiar
comforts
Bag
End
shall
have
But
and
here
looked
hard
Sam
you
really
care
about
you
will
keep
that
dead
secret
See
you
don
you
even
breathe
word
what
you
heard
here
then
hope
Gandalf
will
turn
you
into
spotted
toad
and
fill
the
garden
full
grass
snakes
Sam
fell
his
knees
trembling
Get
Sam
said
Gandalf
have
thought
something
better
than
that
Something
shut
your
mouth
and
punish
you
properly
for
listening
You
shall
away
with
Frodo
sir
cried
Sam
springing
like
dog
invited
for
walk
and
see
Elves
and
all
Hooray
shouted
and
then
burst
into
tears
Chapter
THREE
COMPANY
You
ought
quietly
and
you
ought
soon
said
Gandalf
Two
three
weeks
had
passed
and
still
Frodo
made
sign
getting
ready
know
But
difficult
both
objected
just
vanish
like
Bilbo
the
tale
will
all
over
the
Shire
time
course
you
mustn
vanish
said
Gandalf
That
wouldn
all
said
soon
not
instantly
you
can
think
any
way
slipping
out
the
Shire
without
its
being
generally
known
will
worth
little
delay
But
you
must
not
delay
too
long
What
about
the
autumn
after
Our
Birthday
asked
Frodo
think
could
probably
make
some
arrangements
then
tell
the
truth
was
very
reluctant
start
now
that
had
come
the
point
Bag
End
seemed
more
desirable
residence
than
had
for
years
and
wanted
savour
much
could
his
last
summer
the
Shire
When
autumn
came
knew
that
part
least
his
heart
would
think
more
kindly
journeying
always
did
that
season
had
indeed
privately
made
his
mind
leave
his
fiftieth
birthday
Bilbo
one
hundred
and
twenty
eighth
seemed
somehow
the
proper
day
which
set
out
and
follow
him
Following
Bilbo
was
uppermost
his
mind
and
the
one
thing
that
made
the
thought
leaving
bearable
thought
little
possible
about
the
Ring
and
where
might
lead
him
the
end
But
did
not
tell
all
his
thoughts
Gandalf
What
the
wizard
guessed
was
always
difficult
tell
looked
Frodo
and
smiled
Very
well
said
think
that
will
but
must
not
any
later
getting
very
anxious
the
meanwhile
take
care
and
don
let
out
any
hint
where
you
are
going
And
see
that
Sam
Gamgee
does
not
talk
does
really
shall
turn
him
into
toad
for
where
going
said
Frodo
would
difficult
give
that
away
for
have
clear
idea
myself
yet
Don
absurd
said
Gandalf
not
warning
you
against
leaving
address
the
post
office
But
you
are
leaving
the
Shire
and
that
should
not
known
until
you
are
far
away
And
you
must
least
set
out
either
North
South
West
East
and
the
direction
should
certainly
not
known
have
been
taken
with
the
thoughts
leaving
Bag
End
and
saying
farewell
that
have
never
even
considered
the
direction
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
said
Frodo
For
where
And
what
shall
steer
What
quest
Bilbo
went
find
treasure
there
and
back
again
but
lose
one
and
not
return
far
can
see
But
you
cannot
see
very
far
said
Gandalf
Neither
can
may
your
task
find
the
Cracks
Doom
but
that
quest
may
for
others
not
know
any
rate
you
are
not
ready
for
that
long
road
yet
indeed
said
Frodo
But
the
meantime
what
course
take
Towards
danger
but
not
too
rashly
nor
too
straight
answered
the
wizard
you
want
advice
make
for
Rivendell
That
journey
should
not
prove
too
perilous
though
the
Road
less
easy
than
was
and
will
grow
worse
the
year
fails
Rivendell
said
Frodo
Very
good
will
east
and
will
make
for
Rivendell
will
take
Sam
visit
the
Elves
will
delighted
spoke
lightly
but
his
heart
was
moved
suddenly
with
desire
see
the
house
Elrond
Halfelven
and
breathe
the
air
that
deep
valley
where
many
the
Fair
Folk
still
dwelt
peace
One
summer
evening
astonishing
piece
news
reached
the
Ivy
Bush
and
Green
Dragon
Giants
and
other
portents
the
borders
the
Shire
were
forgotten
for
more
important
matters
Frodo
was
selling
Bag
End
indeed
had
already
sold
the
Sackville
Bagginses
For
nice
bit
too
said
some
bargain
price
said
others
and
that
more
likely
when
Mistress
Lobelia
the
buyer
Otho
had
died
some
years
before
the
ripe
but
disappointed
age
102
Just
why
Frodo
was
selling
his
beautiful
hole
was
even
more
debatable
than
the
price
few
held
the
theory
supported
the
nods
and
hints
Baggins
himself
that
Frodo
money
was
running
out
was
going
leave
Hobbiton
and
live
quiet
way
the
proceeds
the
sale
down
Buckland
among
his
Brandybuck
relations
far
from
the
Sackville
Bagginses
may
some
added
But
firmly
fixed
had
the
notion
the
immeasurable
wealth
the
Bagginses
Bag
End
become
that
most
found
this
hard
believe
harder
than
any
other
reason
unreason
that
their
fancy
could
suggest
most
suggested
dark
and
yet
unrevealed
plot
Gandalf
Though
kept
himself
very
quiet
and
did
not
about
day
was
well
known
that
was
hiding
the
Bag
End
But
however
removal
might
fit
with
the
designs
his
wizardry
there
was
doubt
about
the
fact
Frodo
Baggins
was
going
back
Buckland
Yes
shall
moving
this
autumn
said
Merry
Brandybuck
looking
out
for
nice
little
hole
for
perhaps
small
house
THREE
COMPANY
matter
fact
with
Merry
help
had
already
chosen
and
bought
little
house
Crickhollow
the
country
beyond
Bucklebury
all
but
Sam
pretended
was
going
settle
down
there
permanently
The
decision
set
out
eastwards
had
suggested
the
idea
him
for
Buckland
was
the
eastern
borders
the
Shire
and
had
lived
there
childhood
his
going
back
would
least
seem
credible
Gandalf
stayed
the
Shire
for
over
two
months
Then
one
evening
the
end
June
soon
after
Frodo
plan
had
been
finally
arranged
suddenly
announced
that
was
going
off
again
next
morning
Only
for
short
while
hope
said
But
going
down
beyond
the
southern
borders
get
some
news
can
have
been
idle
longer
than
should
spoke
lightly
but
seemed
Frodo
that
looked
rather
worried
Has
anything
happened
asked
Well
but
have
heard
something
that
has
made
anxious
and
needs
looking
into
think
necessary
after
all
for
you
get
off
once
shall
come
back
immediately
least
send
word
the
meanwhile
stick
your
plan
but
more
careful
than
ever
especially
the
Ring
Let
impress
you
once
more
don
use
itl
went
off
dawn
may
back
any
day
said
the
very
latest
shall
come
back
for
the
farewell
party
think
after
all
you
may
need
company
the
Road
first
Frodo
was
good
deal
disturbed
and
wondered
often
what
Gandalf
could
have
heard
but
his
uneasiness
wore
off
and
the
fine
weather
forgot
his
troubles
for
while
The
Shire
had
seldom
seen
fair
summer
rich
autumn
the
trees
were
laden
with
apples
honey
was
dripping
the
combs
and
the
corn
was
tall
and
full
Autumn
was
well
under
way
before
Frodo
began
worry
about
Gandalf
again
September
was
passing
and
there
was
still
news
him
The
Birthday
and
the
removal
drew
nearer
and
still
did
not
come
send
word
Bag
End
began
busy
Some
Frodo
friends
came
stay
and
help
him
with
the
packing
there
was
Fredegar
Bolger
and
Folco
Boffin
and
course
his
special
friends
Pippin
Took
and
Merry
Brandybuck
Between
them
they
turned
the
whole
place
upside
down
September
2oth
two
covered
carts
went
off
laden
Buckland
conveying
the
furniture
and
goods
that
Frodo
had
not
sold
his
new
home
way
the
Brandywine
Bridge
The
next
day
Frodo
became
really
anxious
and
kept
constant
look
out
for
Gandalf
Thursday
his
birthday
morning
dawned
fair
and
clear
had
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
long
ago
for
Bilbo
great
party
Still
Gandalf
did
not
appear
the
evening
Frodo
gave
his
farewell
feast
was
quite
small
just
dinner
for
himself
and
his
four
helpers
but
was
troubled
and
felt
mood
for
The
thought
that
would
soon
have
part
with
his
young
friends
weighed
his
heart
wondered
how
would
break
them
The
four
younger
hobbits
were
however
high
spirits
and
the
party
soon
became
very
cheerful
spite
Gandalf
absence
The
dining
room
was
bare
except
for
table
and
chairs
but
the
food
was
good
and
there
was
good
wine
Frodo
wine
had
not
been
included
the
sale
the
Sackville
Bagginses
Whatever
happens
the
rest
stuff
when
the
get
their
claws
any
rate
have
found
good
home
for
this
said
Frodo
drained
his
glass
was
the
last
drop
Old
Winyards
When
they
had
sung
many
songs
and
talked
many
things
they
had
done
together
they
toasted
Bilbo
birthday
and
they
drank
his
health
and
Frodo
together
according
Frodo
custom
Then
they
went
out
for
sniff
air
and
glimpse
the
stars
and
then
they
went
bed
Frodo
party
was
over
and
Gandalf
had
not
come
The
next
morning
they
were
busy
packing
another
cart
with
the
remainder
the
luggage
Merry
took
charge
this
and
drove
off
with
Fatty
that
Fredegar
Bolger
Someone
must
get
there
and
warm
the
house
before
you
arrive
said
Merry
Well
see
you
later
the
day
after
tomorrow
you
don
sleep
the
way
Folco
went
home
after
lunch
but
Pippin
remained
behind
Frodo
was
restless
and
anxious
listening
vain
for
sound
Gandalf
decided
wait
until
nightfall
After
that
Gandalf
wanted
him
urgently
would
Crickhollow
and
might
even
get
there
first
For
Frodo
was
going
foot
His
plan
for
pleasure
and
last
look
the
Shire
much
any
other
reason
was
walk
from
Hobbiton
Bucklebury
Ferry
taking
fairly
easy
shall
get
myself
bit
into
training
too
said
looking
himself
dusty
mirror
the
half
empty
hall
had
not
done
any
strenuous
walking
for
long
time
and
the
reflection
looked
rather
flabby
thought
After
lunch
the
Sackville
Bagginses
Lobelia
and
her
sandy
haired
son
Lotho
turned
much
Frodo
annoyance
Ours
last
said
Lobelia
she
stepped
inside
was
not
polite
nor
strictly
true
for
the
sale
Bag
End
did
not
take
effect
until
midnight
But
Lobelia
can
perhaps
forgiven
she
had
been
obliged
wait
about
seventy
seven
years
longer
for
Bag
End
than
she
once
hoped
and
she
was
now
hundred
years
old
Anyway
she
had
come
see
that
nothing
THREE
COMPANY
she
had
paid
for
had
been
carried
off
and
she
wanted
the
keys
took
long
while
satisfy
her
she
had
brought
complete
inven
tory
with
her
and
went
right
through
the
end
she
departed
with
Lotho
and
the
spare
key
and
the
promise
that
the
other
key
would
left
the
Gamgees
Bagshot
Row
She
snorted
and
showed
plainly
that
she
thought
the
Gamgees
capable
plundering
the
hole
during
the
night
Frodo
did
not
offer
her
any
tea
took
his
own
tea
with
Pippin
and
Sam
Gamgee
the
kitchen
had
been
officially
announced
that
Sam
was
coming
Buckland
for
Frodo
and
look
after
his
bit
garden
arrangement
that
was
approved
the
Gaffer
though
did
not
console
him
for
the
prospect
having
Lobelia
neighbour
Our
last
meal
Bag
End
said
Frodo
pushing
back
his
chair
They
left
the
washing
for
Lobelia
Pippin
and
Sam
strapped
their
three
packs
and
piled
them
the
porch
Pippin
went
out
for
last
stroll
the
garden
Sam
disappeared
The
sun
went
down
Bag
End
seemed
sad
and
gloomy
and
dishev
elled
Frodo
wandered
round
the
familiar
rooms
and
saw
the
light
the
sunset
fade
the
walls
and
shadows
creep
out
the
corners
grew
slowly
dark
indoors
went
out
and
walked
down
the
gate
the
bottom
the
path
and
then
short
way
down
the
Hill
Road
half
expected
see
Gandalf
come
striding
through
the
dusk
The
sky
was
clear
and
the
stars
were
growing
bright
going
fine
night
said
aloud
That
good
for
beginning
feel
like
walking
can
bear
any
more
hanging
about
going
start
and
Gandalf
must
follow
turned
back
and
then
stopped
for
heard
voices
just
round
the
corner
the
end
Bagshot
Row
One
voice
was
certainly
the
old
Gaffer
the
other
was
strange
and
somehow
unpleasant
could
not
make
out
what
said
but
heard
the
Gaffer
answers
which
were
rather
shrill
The
old
man
seemed
put
out
Baggins
has
gone
away
Went
this
morning
and
Sam
went
with
him
anyway
all
his
stuff
went
Yes
sold
out
and
gone
tell
Why
Why
none
business
yours
Where
That
ain
secret
moved
Bucklebury
some
such
place
away
down
yonder
Yes
tidy
way
never
been
far
myself
they
queer
folks
Buckland
can
give
message
Good
night
you
Footsteps
went
away
down
the
Hill
Frodo
wondered
vaguely
why
the
fact
that
they
did
not
come
the
Hill
seemed
great
relief
sick
questions
and
curiosity
about
doings
suppose
thought
What
inquisitive
lot
they
all
are
had
half
mind
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
and
ask
the
Gaffer
who
the
inquirer
was
but
thought
better
worse
and
turned
and
walked
quickly
back
Bag
End
Pippin
was
sitting
his
pack
the
porch
Sam
was
not
there
Frodo
stepped
inside
the
dark
door
Sam
called
Sam
Time
Coming
sir
came
the
answer
from
far
within
followed
soon
Sam
himself
wiping
his
mouth
had
been
saying
farewell
the
beer
barrel
the
cellar
All
aboard
Sam
said
Frodo
Yes
sir
Pll
last
for
bit
now
sir
Frodo
shut
and
locked
the
round
door
and
gave
the
key
Sam
Run
down
with
this
your
home
Sam
said
Then
cut
along
the
Row
and
meet
quick
you
can
the
gate
the
lane
beyond
the
meadows
are
not
going
through
the
village
tonight
Too
many
ears
pricking
and
eyes
prying
Sam
ran
off
full
speed
Well
now
off
last
said
Frodo
They
shouldered
their
packs
and
took
their
sticks
and
walked
round
the
corner
the
west
side
Bag
End
Good
bye
said
Frodo
looking
the
dark
blank
windows
waved
his
hand
and
then
turned
and
following
Bilbo
had
known
hurried
after
Peregrin
down
the
garden
path
They
jumped
over
the
low
place
the
hedge
the
bottom
and
took
the
fields
passing
into
the
darkness
like
rustle
the
grasses
the
bottom
the
Hill
its
western
side
they
came
the
gate
opening
narrow
lane
There
they
halted
and
adjusted
the
straps
their
packs
Presently
Sam
appeared
trotting
quickly
and
breathing
hard
his
heavy
pack
was
hoisted
high
his
shoulders
and
had
put
his
head
tall
shapeless
felt
bag
which
called
hat
the
gloom
looked
very
much
like
dwarf
sure
you
have
given
all
the
heaviest
stuff
said
Frodo
pity
snails
and
all
that
carry
their
homes
their
backs
could
take
lot
more
yet
sir
packet
quite
light
said
Sam
stoutly
and
untruthfully
you
don
Sam
said
Pippin
good
for
him
got
nothing
except
what
ordered
pack
been
slack
lately
and
feel
the
weight
less
when
walked
off
some
his
own
kind
poor
old
hobbit
laughed
Frodo
shall
thin
willow
wand
sure
before
get
Buckland
But
was
talking
nonsense
suspect
you
have
taken
more
than
your
share
Sam
and
shall
look
into
our
next
packing
picked
his
stick
again
Well
all
like
walking
the
dark
said
let
put
some
miles
behind
before
bed
For
short
way
they
followed
the
lane
westwards
Then
leaving
they
turned
left
and
took
quietly
the
fields
again
They
went
THREE
COMPANY
single
file
along
hedgerows
and
the
borders
coppices
and
night
fell
dark
about
them
their
dark
cloaks
they
were
invisible
they
all
had
magic
rings
Since
they
were
all
hobbits
and
were
trying
silent
they
made
noise
that
even
hobbits
would
hear
Even
the
wild
things
the
fields
and
woods
hardly
noticed
their
passing
After
some
time
they
crossed
the
Water
west
Hobbiton
narrow
plank
bridge
The
stream
was
there
more
than
winding
black
ribbon
bordered
with
leaning
alder
trees
mile
two
further
south
they
hastily
crossed
the
great
road
from
the
Brandywine
Bridge
they
were
now
the
Tookland
and
bending
south
eastwards
they
made
for
the
Green
Hill
Country
they
began
climb
its
first
slopes
they
looked
back
and
saw
the
lamps
Hobbiton
far
off
twink
ling
the
gentle
valley
the
Water
Soon
disappeared
the
folds
the
darkened
land
and
was
followed
Bywater
beside
its
grey
pool
When
the
light
the
last
farm
was
far
behind
peeping
among
the
trees
Frodo
turned
and
waved
hand
farewell
wonder
shall
ever
look
down
into
that
valley
again
said
quietly
When
they
had
walked
for
about
three
hours
they
rested
The
night
was
clear
cool
and
starry
but
smoke
like
wisps
mist
were
creeping
the
hill
sides
from
the
streams
and
deep
meadows
Thin
clad
birches
swaying
light
wind
above
their
heads
made
black
net
against
the
pale
sky
They
ate
very
frugal
supper
for
hobbits
and
then
went
again
Soon
they
struck
narrow
road
that
went
rolling
and
down
fading
grey
into
the
darkness
ahead
the
road
Woodhall
and
Stock
and
the
Bucklebury
Ferry
climbed
away
from
the
main
road
the
Water
valley
and
wound
over
the
skirts
the
Green
Hills
towards
Woody
End
wild
corner
the
Eastfarthing
After
while
they
plunged
into
deeply
cloven
track
between
tall
trees
that
rustled
their
dry
leaves
the
night
was
very
dark
first
they
talked
hummed
tune
softly
together
being
now
far
away
from
inquisitive
ears
Then
they
marched
silence
and
Pippin
began
lag
behind
last
they
began
climb
steep
slope
stopped
and
yawned
sleepy
said
that
soon
shall
fall
down
the
road
Are
you
going
sleep
your
legs
nearly
midnight
thought
you
liked
walking
the
dark
said
Frodo
But
there
great
hurry
Merry
expects
some
time
the
day
after
tomorrow
but
that
leaves
nearly
two
days
more
halt
the
first
likely
spot
The
wind
the
West
said
Sam
get
the
other
side
this
hill
shall
find
spot
that
sheltered
and
snug
enough
sir
There
dry
fir
wood
just
ahead
remember
rightly
Sam
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
knew
the
land
well
within
twenty
miles
Hobbiton
but
that
was
the
limit
his
geography
Just
over
the
top
the
hill
they
came
the
patch
fir
wood
Leaving
the
road
they
went
into
the
deep
resin
scented
darkness
the
trees
and
gathered
dead
sticks
and
cones
make
fire
Soon
they
had
merry
crackle
flame
the
foot
large
fir
tree
and
they
sat
round
for
while
until
they
began
nod
Then
each
angle
the
great
tree
roots
they
curled
their
cloaks
and
blankets
and
were
soon
fast
asleep
They
set
watch
even
Frodo
feared
danger
yet
for
they
were
still
the
heart
the
Shire
few
creatures
came
and
looked
them
when
the
fire
had
died
away
fox
passing
through
the
wood
business
his
own
stopped
several
minutes
and
sniffed
Hobbits
thought
Well
what
next
have
heard
strange
doings
this
land
but
have
seldom
heard
hobbit
sleeping
out
doors
under
tree
Three
them
There
something
mighty
queer
behind
this
was
quite
right
but
never
found
out
any
more
about
The
morning
came
pale
and
clammy
Frodo
woke
first
and
found
that
tree
root
had
made
hole
his
back
and
that
his
neck
was
stiff
Walking
for
pleasure
Why
didn
drive
thought
usually
did
the
beginning
expedition
And
all
beautiful
feather
beds
are
sold
the
Sackville
Bagginses
These
tree
roots
would
them
good
stretched
Wake
hobbits
cried
beautiful
morning
What
beautiful
about
said
Pippin
peering
over
the
edge
his
blanket
with
one
eye
Sam
Get
breakfast
ready
for
half
past
nine
Have
you
got
the
bath
water
hot
Sam
jumped
looking
rather
bleary
sir
haven
sir
said
Frodo
stripped
the
blankets
from
Pippin
and
rolled
him
over
and
then
walked
off
the
edge
the
wood
Away
eastward
the
sun
was
rising
red
out
the
mists
that
lay
thick
the
world
Touched
with
gold
and
red
the
autumn
trees
seemed
sailing
rootless
shadowy
sea
little
below
him
the
left
the
road
ran
down
steeply
into
hollow
and
disappeared
When
returned
Sam
and
Pippin
had
got
good
fire
going
Water
shouted
Pippin
Where
the
water
don
keep
water
pockets
said
Frodo
thought
you
had
gone
find
some
said
Pippin
busy
setting
out
the
food
and
cups
You
had
better
now
You
can
come
too
said
Frodo
and
bring
all
the
water
bottles
There
was
stream
the
foot
the
hill
They
filled
their
bottles
THREE
COMPANY
and
the
small
camping
kettle
little
fall
where
the
water
fell
few
feet
over
outcrop
grey
stone
was
icy
cold
and
they
spluttered
and
puffed
they
bathed
their
faces
and
hands
When
their
breakfast
was
over
and
their
packs
all
trussed
again
was
after
ten
clock
and
the
day
was
beginning
turn
fine
and
hot
They
went
down
the
slope
and
across
the
stream
where
dived
under
the
road
and
the
next
slope
and
and
down
another
shoulder
the
hills
and
that
time
their
cloaks
blankets
water
food
and
other
gear
already
seemed
heavy
burden
The
day
march
promised
warm
and
tiring
work
After
some
miles
however
the
road
ceased
roll
and
down
climbed
the
top
steep
bank
weary
zig
zagging
sort
way
and
then
prepared
down
for
the
last
time
front
them
they
saw
the
lower
lands
dotted
with
small
clumps
trees
that
melted
away
the
distance
brown
woodland
haze
They
were
looking
across
the
Woody
End
towards
the
Brandywine
River
The
road
wound
away
before
them
like
piece
string
The
road
goes
for
ever
said
Pippin
but
can
without
rest
high
time
for
lunch
sat
down
the
bank
the
side
the
road
and
looked
away
east
into
the
haze
beyond
which
lay
the
River
and
the
end
the
Shire
which
had
spent
all
his
life
Sam
stood
him
His
round
eyes
were
wide
open
for
was
looking
across
lands
had
never
seen
new
horizon
Elves
live
those
woods
asked
Not
that
ever
heard
said
Pippin
Frodo
was
silent
too
was
gazing
eastward
along
the
road
had
never
seen
before
Suddenly
spoke
aloud
but
himself
saying
slowly
The
Road
goes
ever
and
Down
from
the
door
where
began
Now
far
ahead
the
Road
has
gone
And
must
follow
can
Pursuing
with
weary
feet
Until
joins
some
larger
way
Where
many
paths
and
errands
meet
And
whither
then
cannot
say
That
sounds
like
bit
old
Bilbo
rhyming
said
Pippin
one
your
imitations
does
not
sound
altogether
encouraging
don
know
said
Frodo
came
then
was
making
but
may
have
heard
long
ago
Certainly
reminds
very
much
Bilbo
the
last
years
before
went
away
used
often
say
there
was
only
one
Road
that
was
like
great
river
its
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
springs
were
every
doorstep
and
every
path
was
its
tributary
dangerous
business
Frodo
going
out
your
door
used
say
You
step
into
the
Road
and
you
don
keep
your
feet
there
knowing
where
you
might
swept
off
you
realize
that
this
the
very
path
that
goes
through
Mirkwood
and
that
you
let
might
take
you
the
Lonely
Mountain
even
further
and
worse
places
used
say
that
the
path
outside
the
front
door
Bag
End
especially
after
had
been
out
for
long
walk
Well
the
Road
won
sweep
anywhere
for
hour
least
said
Pippin
unslinging
his
pack
The
others
followed
his
example
putting
their
packs
against
the
bank
and
their
legs
out
into
the
road
After
rest
they
had
good
lunch
and
then
more
rest
The
sun
was
beginning
get
low
and
the
light
afternoon
was
the
land
they
went
down
the
hill
far
they
had
not
met
soul
the
road
This
way
was
not
much
used
being
hardly
fit
for
carts
and
there
was
little
traffic
the
Woody
End
They
had
been
jogging
along
again
for
hour
more
when
Sam
stopped
moment
listening
They
were
now
level
ground
and
the
road
after
much
winding
lay
straight
ahead
through
grass
land
sprinkled
with
tall
trees
outliers
the
approaching
woods
can
hear
pony
horse
coming
along
the
road
behind
said
Sam
They
looked
back
but
the
turn
the
road
prevented
them
from
seeing
far
wonder
that
Gandalf
coming
after
said
Frodo
but
even
said
had
feeling
that
was
not
and
sudden
desire
hide
from
the
view
the
rider
came
over
him
may
not
matter
much
said
apologetically
but
would
rather
not
seen
the
road
anyone
sick
doings
being
noticed
and
discussed
And
Gandalf
added
afterthought
can
give
him
little
surprise
pay
him
out
for
being
late
Let
get
out
sight
The
other
two
ran
quickly
the
left
and
down
into
little
hollow
not
far
from
the
road
There
they
lay
flat
Frodo
hesitated
for
second
curiosity
some
other
feeling
was
struggling
with
his
desire
hide
The
sound
hoofs
drew
nearer
Just
time
threw
himself
down
patch
long
grass
behind
tree
that
overshadowed
the
road
Then
lifted
his
head
and
peered
cautiously
above
one
the
great
roots
Round
the
corner
came
black
horse
hobbit
pony
but
full
sized
horse
and
sat
large
man
who
seemed
crouch
the
saddle
wrapped
great
black
cloak
and
hood
that
only
his
boots
the
high
stirrups
showed
below
his
face
was
shadowed
and
invisible
THREE
COMPANY
When
reached
the
tree
and
was
level
with
Frodo
the
horse
stopped
The
riding
figure
sat
quite
still
with
its
head
bowed
iflistening
From
inside
the
hood
came
noise
someone
sniffing
catch
elusive
scent
the
head
turned
from
side
side
the
road
sudden
unreasoning
fear
discovery
laid
hold
Frodo
and
thought
his
Ring
hardly
dared
breathe
and
yet
the
desire
get
out
his
pocket
became
strong
that
began
slowly
move
his
hand
felt
that
had
only
slip
and
then
would
safe
The
advice
Gandalf
seemed
absurd
Bilbo
had
used
the
Ring
And
still
the
Shire
thought
his
hand
touched
the
chain
which
hung
that
moment
the
rider
sat
and
shook
the
reins
The
horse
stepped
forward
walking
slowly
first
and
then
breaking
into
quick
trot
Frodo
crawled
the
edge
the
road
and
watched
the
rider
until
dwindled
into
the
distance
could
not
quite
sure
but
seemed
him
that
suddenly
before
passed
out
sight
the
horse
turned
aside
and
went
into
the
trees
the
right
Well
call
that
very
queer
and
indeed
disturbing
said
Frodo
himself
walked
towards
his
companions
Pippin
and
Sam
had
remained
flat
the
grass
and
had
seen
nothing
Frodo
described
the
rider
and
his
strange
behaviour
can
say
why
but
felt
certain
was
looking
smelling
for
and
also
felt
certain
that
did
not
want
him
discover
never
seen
felt
anything
like
the
Shire
before
But
what
has
one
the
Big
People
got
with
said
Pippin
And
what
doing
this
part
the
world
There
are
some
Men
about
said
Frodo
Down
the
South
farthing
they
have
had
trouble
with
Big
People
believe
But
have
never
heard
anything
like
this
rider
wonder
where
comes
from
Begging
your
pardon
put
Sam
suddenly
know
where
comes
from
from
Hobbiton
that
this
here
black
rider
comes
unless
there
more
than
one
And
know
where
going
What
you
mean
said
Frodo
sharply
looking
him
aston
ishment
Why
didn
you
speak
before
have
only
just
remembered
sir
was
like
this
when
got
back
our
hole
yesterday
evening
with
the
key
dad
says
Hallo
Sam
says
thought
you
were
away
with
Frodo
this
morning
There
been
strange
customer
asking
for
Baggins
Bag
End
and
only
just
gone
sent
him
Bucklebury
Not
that
liked
the
sound
him
seemed
mighty
put
out
when
told
him
Baggins
had
left
his
old
home
for
good
Hissed
did
gave
quite
shudder
What
sort
fellow
was
says
the
Gaffer
don
know
says
but
wasn
hobbit
was
tall
and
black
like
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
and
stooped
over
reckon
was
one
the
Big
Folk
from
foreign
parts
spoke
funny
couldn
stay
hear
more
sir
since
you
were
waiting
and
didn
give
much
heed
myself
The
Gaffer
getting
old
and
more
than
bit
blind
and
must
have
been
near
dark
when
this
fellow
come
the
Hill
and
found
him
taking
the
air
the
end
our
Row
hope
hasn
done
harm
sir
nor
The
Gaffer
can
blamed
anyway
said
Frodo
matter
fact
heard
him
talking
stranger
who
seemed
inquiring
for
and
nearly
went
and
asked
him
who
was
wish
had
you
had
told
about
before
might
have
been
more
careful
the
road
Still
there
may
connexion
between
this
rider
and
the
Gaffer
stranger
said
Pippin
left
Hobbiton
secretly
enough
and
don
see
how
could
have
followed
What
about
the
smelling
sir
said
Sam
And
the
Gaffer
said
was
black
chap
wish
had
waited
for
Gandalf
Frodo
muttered
But
perhaps
would
only
have
made
matters
worse
Then
you
know
guess
something
about
this
rider
said
Pippin
who
had
caught
the
muttered
words
don
know
and
would
rather
not
guess
said
Frodo
All
right
cousin
Frodo
You
can
keep
your
secret
for
the
present
you
want
mysterious
the
meanwhile
what
are
should
like
bite
and
sup
but
somehow
think
had
better
move
from
here
Your
talk
sniffing
riders
with
invisible
noses
has
unsettled
Yes
think
will
move
now
said
Frodo
but
not
the
road
case
that
rider
comes
back
another
follows
him
ought
good
step
more
today
Buckland
still
miles
away
The
shadows
the
trees
were
long
and
thin
the
grass
they
started
off
again
They
now
kept
stone
throw
the
left
the
road
and
kept
out
sight
much
they
could
But
this
hindered
them
for
the
grass
was
thick
and
tussocky
and
the
ground
uneven
and
the
trees
began
draw
together
into
thickets
The
sun
had
gone
down
red
behind
the
hills
their
backs
and
evening
was
coming
before
they
came
back
the
road
the
end
the
long
level
over
which
had
run
straight
for
some
miles
that
point
bent
left
and
went
down
into
the
lowlands
the
Yale
making
for
Stock
but
lane
branched
right
winding
through
wood
ancient
oak
trees
its
way
Woodhall
That
the
way
for
said
Frodo
Not
far
from
the
road
meeting
they
came
the
huge
hulk
THREE
COMPANY
tree
was
still
alive
and
had
leaves
the
small
branches
that
had
put
out
round
the
broken
stumps
its
long
fallen
limbs
but
was
hollow
and
could
entered
great
crack
the
side
away
from
the
road
The
hobbits
crept
inside
and
sat
there
upon
floor
old
leaves
and
decayed
wood
They
rested
and
had
light
meal
talking
quietly
and
listening
from
time
time
Twilight
was
about
them
they
crept
back
the
lane
The
West
wind
was
sighing
the
branches
Leaves
were
whispering
Soon
the
road
began
fall
gently
but
steadily
into
the
dusk
star
came
out
above
the
trees
the
darkening
East
before
them
They
went
abreast
and
step
keep
their
spirits
After
time
the
stars
grew
thicker
and
brighter
the
feeling
disquiet
left
them
and
they
longer
listened
for
the
sound
hoofs
They
began
hum
softly
hobbits
have
way
doing
they
walk
along
especially
when
they
are
drawing
near
home
night
With
most
hobbits
supper
song
bed
song
but
these
hobbits
hummed
walking
song
though
not
course
without
any
mention
supper
and
bed
Bilbo
Baggins
had
made
the
words
tune
that
was
old
the
hills
and
taught
Frodo
they
walked
the
lanes
the
Water
valley
and
talked
about
Adventure
Upon
the
hearth
the
fire
red
Beneath
the
roof
there
bed
But
not
yet
weary
are
our
feet
Still
round
the
corner
may
meet
sudden
tree
standing
stone
That
none
have
seen
but
alone
Tree
and
flower
and
leaf
and
grass
Let
them
pass
Let
them
pass
Hill
and
water
under
sky
Pass
them
Pass
them
Still
round
the
corner
there
may
wait
new
road
secret
gate
And
though
pass
them
today
Tomorrow
may
come
this
way
And
take
the
hidden
paths
that
run
Towards
the
Moon
the
Sun
Apple

Let

Let

Fare

Fare
you
well
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Home
behind
the
world
ahead
And
there
are
many
paths
tread
Through
shadows
the
edge
night
Until
the
stars
are
all
alight
Then
world
behind
and
home
ahead
Well
wander
back
home
and
bed
Mist
and
twilight
cloud
and
shade
Away
shall
fade
Away
shall
fade
Fire
and
lamp
and
meat
and
bread
And
then
bed
And
then
bed
The
song
ended
And
now
bed
And
now
bed
sang
Pippin
high
voice
Hush
said
Frodo
think
hear
hoofs
again
They
stopped
suddenly
and
stood
silent
tree
shadows
listen
ing
There
was
sound
hoofs
the
lane
some
way
behind
but
coming
slow
and
clear
down
the
wind
Quickly
and
quietly
they
slipped
off
the
path
and
ran
into
the
deeper
shade
under
the
oak
trees
Don
let
too
far
said
Frodo
don
want
seen
but
want
see
another
Black
Rider
Very
well
said
Pippin
But
don
forget
the
sniffing
The
hoofs
drew
nearer
They
had
time
find
any
hiding
place
better
than
the
general
darkness
under
the
trees
Sam
and
Pippin
crouched
behind
large
tree
bole
while
Frodo
crept
back
few
yards
towards
the
lane
showed
grey
and
pale
line
fading
light
through
the
wood
Above
the
stars
were
thick
the
dim
sky
but
there
was
moon
The
sound
hoofs
stopped
Frodo
watched
saw
something
dark
pass
across
the
lighter
space
between
two
trees
and
then
halt
looked
like
the
black
shade
horse
led
smaller
black
shadow
The
black
shadow
stood
close
the
point
where
they
had
left
the
path
and
swayed
from
side
side
Frodo
thought
heard
the
sound
snuffling
The
shadow
bent
the
ground
and
then
began
crawl
towards
him
Once
more
the
desire
slip
the
Ring
came
over
Frodo
but
this
time
was
stronger
than
before
strong
that
almost
before
realized
what
was
doing
his
hand
was
groping
his
pocket
But
that
moment
there
came
sound
like
mingled
song
and
laugh
ter
Clear
voices
rose
and
fell
the
starlit
air
The
black
shadow
straightened
and
retreated
climbed
the
shadowy
horse
and
seemed
vanish
across
the
lane
into
the
darkness
the
other
side
Frodo
breathed
again
Elves
exclaimed
Sam
hoarse
whisper
Elves
sir
would
THREE
COMPANY
have
burst
out
the
trees
and
dashed
off
towards
the
voices
they
had
not
pulled
him
back
Yes
Elves
said
Frodo
One
can
meet
them
sometimes
the
Woody
End
They
don
live
the
Shire
but
they
wander
into
spring
and
autumn
out
their
own
lands
away
beyond
the
Tower
Hills
thankful
that
they
You
did
not
see
but
that
Black
Rider
stopped
just
here
and
was
actually
crawling
towards
when
the
song
began
soon
heard
the
voices
slipped
away
What
about
the
Elves
said
Sam
too
excited
trouble
about
the
rider
Can
and
see
them
Listen
They
are
coming
this
way
said
Frodo
have
only
wait
The
singing
drew
nearer
One
clear
voice
rose
now
above
the
others
was
singing
the
fair
elven
tongue
which
Frodo
knew
only
little
and
the
others
knew
nothing
Yet
the
sound
blending
with
the
melody
seemed
shape
itself
their
thought
into
words
which
they
only
partly
understood
This
was
the
song
Frodo
heard
Snow
white
Snow
white
Lady
clear
Queen
beyond
the
Western
Seas
Light
that
wander
here
Amid
the
world
woven
trees
Gilthoniel

Clear
are
thy
eyes
and
bright
thy
breath
Snow

Snow

sing
thee
far
land
beyond

stars
that
the
Sunless
Year
With
shining
hand
her
were
sown
windy
fields
now
bright
and
clear
see
your
silver
blossom
blown
Elbereth
Gilthoniel
still
remember
who
dwell
this
far
land
beneath
the
trees
Thy
starlight
the
Western
Seas
The
song
ended
These
are
High
Elves
They
spoke
the
name
Elbereth
said
Frodo
amazement
Few
that
fairest
folk
are
ever
seen
the
Shire
Not
many
now
remain
Middle
earth
east
the
Great
Sea
This
indeed
strange
chance
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
The
hobbits
sat
shadow
the
wayside
Before
long
the
Elves
came
down
the
lane
towards
the
valley
They
passed
slowly
and
the
hobbits
could
see
the
starlight
glimmering
their
hair
and
their
eyes
They
bore
lights
yet
they
walked
shimmer
like
the
light
the
moon
above
the
rim
the
hills
before
rises
seemed
fall
about
their
feet
They
were
now
silent
and
the
last
Elf
passed
turned
and
looked
towards
the
hobbits
and
laughed
Hail
Frodo
cried
You
are
abroad
late
are
you
perhaps
lost
Then
called
aloud
the
others
and
all
the
company
stopped
and
gathered
round
This
indeed
wonderful
they
said
Three
hobbits
wood
night
have
not
seen
such
thing
since
Bilbo
went
away
What
the
meaning
The
meaning
fair
people
said
Frodo
simply
that
seem
going
the
same
way
you
are
like
walking
under
the
stars
But
would
welcome
your
company
But
have
need
other
company
and
hobbits
are
dull
they
laughed
And
how
you
know
that
the
same
way
you
for
you
not
know
whither
are
going
And
how
you
know
name
asked
Frodo
return
know
many
things
they
said
have
seen
you
often
before
with
Bilbo
though
you
may
not
have
seen
Who
are
you
and
who
your
lord
asked
Frodo
Gildor
answered
their
leader
the
Elf
who
had
first
hailed
him
Gildor
Inglorion
the
House
Finrod
are
Exiles
and
most
our
kindred
have
long
ago
departed
and
too
are
now
only
tarrying
here
while
ere
return
over
the
Great
Sea
But
some
our
kinsfolk
dwell
still
peace
Rivendell
Come
now
Frodo
tell
what
you
are
doing
For
see
that
there
some
shadow
fear
upon
you
Wise
People
interrupted
Pippin
eagerly
Tell
about
the
Black
Riders
Black
Riders
they
said
low
voices
Why
you
ask
about
Black
Riders
Because
two
Black
Riders
have
overtaken
today
one
has
done
twice
said
Pippin
only
little
while
ago
slipped
away
you
drew
near
The
Elves
did
not
answer
once
but
spoke
together
softly
their
own
tongue
length
Gildor
turned
the
hobbits
will
not
speak
this
here
said
think
you
had
best
come
now
with
not
our
custom
but
for
this
time
will
take
you
our
road
and
you
shall
lodge
with
tonight
you
will
Fair
Folk
This
good
fortune
beyond
hope
said
Pippin
Sam
was
speechless
thank
you
indeed
Gildor
Inglorion
said

added
the
High

careful

cried
Gildor
laughing
Speak

Here
scholar
the
Ancient

Bilbo
was
good
master
Hail
Elf
friend
said
bowing
Frodo
Come
now
with
your
friends
and
join
our
company
You
had
best
walk
the
middle
that
you
may
not
stray
You
may
weary
before
halt
Why
Where
are
you
going
asked
Frodo
For
tonight
the
woods
the
hills
above
Woodhall
some
miles
but
you
shall
have
rest
the
end
and
will
shorten
your
journey
tomorrow
They
now
marched
again
silence
and
passed
like
shadows
and
faint
lights
for
Elves
even
more
than
hobbits
could
walk
when
they
wished
without
sound
footfall
Pippin
soon
began
feel
sleepy
and
staggered
once
twice
but
each
time
tall
Elf
his
side
put
out
his
arm
and
saved
him
from
fall
Sam
walked
along
Frodo
side
dream
with
expression
his
face
half
fear
and
half
astonished
joy
The
woods
either
side
became
denser
the
trees
were
now
younger
and
thicker
and
the
lane
went
lower
running
down
into
fold
the
hills
there
were
many
deep
brakes
hazel
the
rising
slopes
either
hand
last
the
Elves
turned
aside
from
the
path
green
ride
lay
almost
unseen
through
the
thickets
the
right
and
this
they
followed
wound
away
back
the
wooded
slopes
the
top
shoulder
the
hills
that
stood
out
into
the
lower
land
the
river
valley
Suddenly
they
came
out
the
shadow
the
trees
and
before
them
lay
wide
space
grass
grey
under
the
night
three
sides
the
woods
pressed
upon
but
eastward
the
ground
fell
steeply
and
the
tops
the
dark
trees
growing
the
bottom
the
slope
were
below
their
feet
Beyond
the
low
lands
lay
dim
and
flat
under
the
stars
Nearer
hand
few
lights
twinkled
the
village
Woodhall
The
Elves
sat
the
grass
and
spoke
together
soft
voices
they
seemed
take
further
notice
the
hobbits
Frodo
and
his
com
panions
wrapped
themselves
cloaks
and
blankets
and
drowsiness
stole
over
them
The
night
grew
and
the
lights
the
valley
went
out
Pippin
fell
asleep
pillowed
green
hillock
Away
high
the
East
swung
Remmirath
the
Netted
Stars
and
slowly
above
the
mists
red
Borgil
rose
glowing
like
jewel
fire
Then
some
shift
airs
all
the
mist
was
drawn
away
like
veil
and
there
leaned
climbed
over
the
rim
the
world
the
Swordsman
the
Sky
Menelvagor
with
his
shining
belt
The
Elves
all
burst
into
song
Suddenly
under
the
trees
fire
sprang
with
red
light
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Come
the
Elves
called
the
hobbits
Come
Now
the
time
for
speech
and
merriment
Pippin
sat
and
rubbed
his
eyes
shivered
There
fire
the
hall
and
food
for
hungry
guests
said
Elf
standing
before
him
the
south
end
the
greensward
there
was
opening
There
the
green
floor
ran
into
the
wood
and
formed
wide
space
like
hall
roofed
the
boughs
trees
Their
great
trunks
ran
like
pillars
down
each
side
the
middle
there
was
wood
fire
blazing
and
upon
the
tree
pillars
torches
with
lights
gold
and
silver
were
burning
steadily
The
Elves
sat
round
the
fire
upon
the
grass
upon
the
sawn
rings
old
trunks
Some
went
and
fro
bearing
cups
and
pouring
drink
others
brought
food
heaped
plates
and
dishes
This
poor
fare
they
said
the
hobbits
for
are
lodging
the
greenwood
far
from
our
halls
ever
you
are
our
guests
home
will
treat
you
better
seems
good
enough
for
birthday
party
said
Frodo
Pippin
afterwards
recalled
little
either
food
drink
for
his
mind
was
filled
with
the
light
upon
the
elf
faces
and
the
sound
voices
various
and
beautiful
that
felt
waking
dream
But
remembered
that
there
was
bread
surpassing
the
savour
fair
white
loaf
one
who
starving
and
fruits
sweet
wildberries
and
richer
than
the
tended
fruits
gardens
drained
cup
that
was
filled
with
fragrant
draught
cool
clear
fountain
golden
summer
afternoon
Sam
could
never
describe
words
nor
picture
clearly
himself
what
felt
thought
that
night
though
remained
his
memory
one
the
chief
events
his
life
The
nearest
ever
got
was
say
Well
sir
could
grow
apples
like
that
would
call
myself
gardener
But
was
the
singing
that
went
heart
you
know
what
mean
Frodo
sat
eating
drinking
and
talking
with
delight
but
his
mind
was
chiefly
the
words
spoken
knew
little
the
elf
speech
and
listened
eagerly
Now
and
again
spoke
those
that
served
him
and
thanked
them
their
own
language
They
smiled
him
and
said
laughing
Here
jewel
among
hobbits
After
while
Pippin
fell
fast
asleep
and
was
lifted
and
borne
away
bower
under
the
trees
there
was
laid
upon
soft
bed
and
slept
the
rest
the
night
away
Sam
refused
leave
his
master
When
Pippin
had
gone
came
and
sat
curled
Frodo
feet
where
last
nodded
and
closed
his
eyes
Frodo
remained
long
awake
talking
with
Gildor
They
spoke
many
things
old
and
new
and
Frodo
questioned
Gildor
much
about
happenings
the
wide
world
outside
the
Shire
THREE
COMPANY
The
tidings
were
mostly
sad
and
ominous
gathering
darkness
the
wars
Men
and
the
flight
the
Elves
last
Frodo
asked
the
question
that
was
nearest
his
heart
Tell
Gildor
have
you
ever
seen
Bilbo
since
left
Gildor
smiled
Yes
answered
Twice
said
farewell
this
very
spot
But
saw
him
once
again
far
from
here
would
say
more
about
Bilbo
and
Frodo
fell
silent
You
not
ask
tell
much
that
concerns
yourself
Frodo
said
Gildor
But
already
know
little
and
can
read
more
your
face
and
the
thought
behind
your
questions
You
are
leaving
the
Shire
and
yet
you
doubt
that
you
will
find
what
you
seek
accom
plish
what
you
intend
that
you
will
ever
return
not
that
said
Frodo
but
thought
going
was
secret
known
only
Gandalf
and
faithful
Sam
looked
down
Sam
who
was
snoring
gently
The
secret
will
not
reach
the
Enemy
from
said
Gildor
The
Enemy
said
Frodo
Then
you
know
why
leaving
the
Shire
not
know
for
what
reason
the
Enemy
pursuing
you
answered
Gildor
but
perceive
that
strange
indeed
though
that
seems
And
warn
you
that
peril
now
both
before
you
and
behind
you
and
upon
either
side
You
mean
the
Riders
feared
that
they
were
servants
the
Enemy
What
are
the
Black
Riders
Has
Gandalf
told
you
nothing
Nothing
about
such
creatures
Then
think
not
for
say
more
lest
terror
should
keep
you
from
your
journey
For
seems
that
you
have
set
out
only
just
time
indeed
you
are
time
You
must
now
make
haste
and
neither
stay
nor
turn
back
for
the
Shire
longer
any
protection
you
cannot
imagine
what
information
could
more
terrifying
than
your
hints
and
warnings
exclaimed
Frodo
knew
that
danger
lay
ahead
course
but
did
not
expect
meet
our
own
Shire
Can
hobbit
walk
from
the
Water
the
River
peace
But
not
your
own
Shire
said
Gildor
Others
dwelt
here
before
hobbits
were
and
others
will
dwell
here
again
when
hobbits
are
more
The
wide
world
all
about
you
you
can
fence
yourselves
but
you
cannot
for
ever
fence
out
know
and
yet
has
always
seemed
safe
and
familiar
What
can
now
plan
was
leave
the
Shire
secretly
and
make
way
Rivendell
but
now
footsteps
are
dogged
before
ever
get
Buckland
think
you
should
still
follow
that
plan
said
Gildor
not
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
think
the
Road
will
prove
too
hard
for
your
courage
But
you
desire
clearer
counsel
you
should
ask
Gandalf
not
know
the
reason
for
your
flight
and
therefore
not
know
what
means
your
pursuers
will
assail
you
These
things
Gandalf
must
know
suppose
that
you
will
see
him
before
you
leave
the
Shire
hope
But
that
another
thing
that
makes
anxious
have
been
expecting
Gandalf
for
many
days
was
have
come
Hobbiton
the
latest
two
nights
ago
but
has
never
appeared
Now
wondering
what
can
have
happened
Should
wait
for
him
Gildor
was
silent
for
moment
not
like
this
news
said
last
That
Gandalf
should
late
does
not
bode
well
But
said
not
meddle
the
affairs
Wizards
for
they
are
subtle
and
quick
anger
The
choice
yours
wait
And
also
said
answered
Frodo
not
the
Elves
for
counsel
for
they
will
say
both
and
yes
indeed
laughed
Gildor
Elves
seldom
give
unguarded
advice
for
advice
dangerous
gift
even
from
the
wise
the
wise
and
all
courses
may
run
ill
But
what
would
you
You
have
not
told
all
concerning
yourself
and
how
then
shall
choose
better
than
your
But
you
demand
advice
will
for
friendship
sake
give
think
you
should
now
once
without
delay
and
Gandalf
does
not
come
before
you
set
out
then
also
advise
this
not
alone
Take
such
friends
are
trusty
and
willing
Now
you
should
grateful
for
not
give
this
counsel
gladly
The
Elves
have
their
own
labours
and
their
own
sorrows
and
they
are
little
concerned
with
the
ways
hobbits
any
other
creatures
upon
earth
Our
paths
cross
theirs
seldom
chance
purpose
this
meeting
there
may
more
than
chance
but
the
purpose
not
clear
and
fear
say
too
much
deeply
grateful
said
Frodo
but
wish
you
would
tell
plainly
what
the
Black
Riders
are
take
your
advice
may
not
see
Gandalf
for
long
while
and
ought
know
what
the
danger
that
pursues
not
enough
know
that
they
are
servants
the
Enemy
answered
Gildor
Flee
them
Speak
words
them
They
are
deadly
Ask
more
But

forbodes
that
ere
all
ended
you
Frodo

Drogo
will
know
more
these

things
than
Gildor
Inglorion
May
Elbereth

you
But
where
shall
find
courage
asked
Frodo
That
what
chiefly
need
Courage

said
Gildor
good
hope
Sleep
now
the

have
gone
but
will

The

Frodo

Gildor

and
the

led
him

beside

and

into

SHORT

MUSHROOMS
the
morning
Frodo
woke
refreshed
was
lying
bower
made
living
tree
with
branches
laced
and
drooping
the
ground
his
bed
was
fern
and
grass
deep
and
soft
and
strangely
fragrant
The
sun
was
shining
through
the
fluttering
leaves
which
were
still
green
upon
the
tree
jumped
and
went
out
Sam
was
sitting
the
grass
near
the
edge
the
wood
Pippin
was
standing
studying
the
sky
and
weather
There
was
sign
the
Elves
They
have
left
fruit
and
drink
and
bread
said
Pippin
Come
and
have
your
breakfast
The
bread
tastes
almost
good
did
last
night
did
not
want
leave
you
any
but
Sam
insisted
Frodo
sat
down
beside
Sam
and
began
eat
What
the
plan
for
today
asked
Pippin
walk
Bucklebury
quickly
possible
answered
Frodo
and
gave
his
attention
the
food
you
think
shall
see
anything
those
Riders
asked
Pippin
cheerfully
Under
the
morning
sun
the
prospect
seeing
whole
troop
them
did
not
seem
very
alarming
him
Yes
probably
said
Frodo
not
liking
the
reminder
But
hope
get
across
the
river
without
their
seeing
Did
you
find
out
anything
about
them
from
Gildor
Not
much
only
hints
and
riddles
said
Frodo
evasively
Did
you
ask
about
the
sniffing
didn
discuss
said
Frodo
with
his
mouth
full
You
should
have
sure
very
important
that
case
Iam
sure
Gildor
would
have
refused
explain
said
Frodo
sharply
And
now
leave
peace
for
bit
don
want
answer
string
questions
while
eating
want
think
Good
heavens
said
Pippin
breakfast
walked
away
towards
the
edge
the
green
From
Frodo
mind
the
bright
morning
treacherously
bright
thought
had
not
banished
the
fear
pursuit
and
pondered
the
words
Gildor
The
merry
voice
Pippin
came
him
was
running
the
green
turf
and
singing
could
not
said
himself
one
thing
take
young
friends
walking
over
the
Shire
with
until
are
hungry

weary
and

Sam
Gamgee
and
discovered
that
Sam
was
watching
him
Well
Sam
said
What

Very

said
They
laughed
Who
are
they
and
what
are
you
talking
about
The
Elves
sir
had
some
talk
last
night
and
they
seemed
know
you
were
going
away
didn
see
the
use
denying
Wonderful
folk
Elves
sir
Wonderful
They
are
said
Frodo
you
like
them
still
now
you
have
had
closer
view
They
seem
bit
above
likes
and
dislikes
speak
answered
Sam
slowly
don
seem
matter
what
think
about
them
They
are
quite
different
from
what
expected
old
and
young
and
gay
and
sad
were
Frodo
looked
Sam
rather
startled
half
expecting
see
some
outward
sign
the
odd
change
that
seemed
have
come
over
him
did
not
sound
like
the
voice
the
old
Sam
Gamgee
that
thought

But
looked
like
the
old
Sam
Gamgee
sitting
there
except
that
his
face
was
unusually
thoughtful
you
feel
any
need
leave
the
Shire

now
that
your
wish

them

But

Frodo
finished
his

silence
Then
standing
looked
over
the
land
ahead
and
called
Pippin
THE
LORD
THE

All
ready
start
said
Pippin
ran
must
getting
off
once
slept
late
and
there
are
good
many
miles
You
slept
late
you
mean
said
Pippin
was
long
before
and
are
only
waiting
for
you
finish
eating
and
thinking
have
finished
both
now
And
going
make
for
Bucklebury
Ferry
quickly
possible
not
going
out
the
way
back
the
road
left
last
night
going
cut
straight
across
country
from
here
Then
you
are
going
fly
said
Pippin
You
won
cut
straight
foot
anywhere
this
country
can
cut
straighter
than
the
road
anyway
answered
Frodo
The
Ferry
east
from
Woodhall
but
the
hard
road
curves
away
the
left
you
can
see
bend
away
north
over
there

round
the

the

the

from

But
that

out
the

could
save

the

made
line
for
the
Ferry
from
where
stand
Short
cuts
make

argued
Pippin
The
country
rough
round
here
and
there
are
bogs
and
all
kinds
difficulties
down
the
Marish
know
the
land
these
parts
And
you
are
worrying
about
Black
Riders
can
see
that
any
worse
meeting
them
road
than
wood
field
less
easy
find
people
the
woods
and
fields
answered
Frodo
And
you
are
supposed
the
road
there
some
chance
that
you
will
looked
for
the
road
and
not
off
All
right
said
Pippin
will
follow
you
into
every
bog
and
ditch
But
hard
had
counted
passing
the
Golden
Perch
Stock
before
sundown
The
best
beer
the
Eastfarthing
used
long
time
since
tasted
That
settles
said
Frodo
Short
cuts
make
delays
but
inns
make
longer
ones
all
costs
must
keep
you
away
from
the
Golden
Perch
want
get
Bucklebury
before
dark
What
you
say
Sam
will
along
with
you
Frodo
said
Sam
spite
private
misgivings
and
deep
regret
for
the
best
beer
the
Eastfarthing
Then
are
going
toil
through
bog
and
briar
let
now
said
Pippin
was
already
nearly
hot
had
been
the
day
before
but
clouds
were
beginning
come
from
the
West
looked
likely
turn
rain
The
hobbits
scrambled
down
steep
green
bank
and
plunged
into
the
thick
trees
below
Their
course
had
been
chosen
leave
Woodhall
their
left
and
cut
slanting
through
the
woods
that
clustered
along
the
eastern
side
the
hills
until
they
reached
SHORT
CUT
MUSHROOMS
the
flats
beyond
Then
they
could
make
straight
for
the
Ferry
over
country
that
was
open
except
for
few
ditches
and
fences
Frodo
reckoned
they
had
eighteen
miles
straight
line
soon
found
that
the
thicket
was
closer
and
more
tangled
than
had
appeared
There
were
paths
the
undergrowth
and
they
did
not
get
very
fast
When
they
had
struggled
the
bottom
the
bank
they
found
stream
running
down
from
the
hills
behind
deeply
dug
bed
with
steep
slippery
sides
overhung
with
brambles
Most
inconveniently
cut
across
the
line
they
had
chosen
They
could
not
jump
over
nor
indeed
get
across
all
without
getting
wet
scratched
and
muddy
They
halted
wondering
what
First
check
said
Pippin
smiling
grimly
Sam
Gamgee
looked
back
Through
opening
the
trees
caught
glimpse
the
top
the
green
bank
from
which
they
had
climbed
down
Look
said
clutching
Frodo
the
arm
They
all
looked
and
the
edge
high
above
them
they
saw
against
the
sky
horse
standing
Beside
stooped
black
figure
They
once
gave
any
idea
going
back
Frodo
led
the
way
and
plunged
quickly
into
the
thick
bushes
beside
the
stream
Whew
said
Pippin
were
both
right
The
short
cut
has
gone
crooked
already
but
got
under
cover
only
just
time
You
got
sharp
ears
Sam
can
you
hear
anything
coming
They
stood
still
almost
holding
their
breath
they
listened
but
there
was
sound
pursuit
don
fancy
would
try
bringing
his
horse
down
that
bank
said
Sam
But
guess
knows
came
down
had
better
going
Going
was
not
altogether
easy
They
had
packs
carry
and
the
bushes
and
brambles
were
reluctant
let
them
through
They
were
cut
off
from
the
wind
the
ridge
behind
and
the
air
was
still
and
stuffy
When
they
forced
their
way
last
into
more
open
ground
they
were
hot
and
tired
and
very
scratched
and
they
were
also
longer
certain
the
direction
which
they
were
going
The
banks
the
stream
sank
reached
the
levels
and
became
broader
and
shallower
wandering
off
towards
the
Marish
and
the
River
Why
this
the
Stock
brook
said
Pippin
are
going
try
and
get
back
our
course
must
cross
once
and
bear
right
They
waded
the
stream
and
hurried
over
wide
open
space
rush
grown
and
treeless
the
further
side
Beyond
that
they
came
again
belt
trees
tall
oaks
for
the
most
part
with
here
and
there
elm
tree
ash
The
ground
was
fairly
level
and
there
was
little
undergrowth
but
the
trees
were
too
close
for
them
see
far
ahead
The
leaves
blew
upwards
sudden
gusts
wind
and
spots
rain
began
fall
from
the
overcast
sky
Then
the
wind
died
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
away
and
the
rain
came
streaming
down
They
trudged
along
fast
they
could
over
patches
grass
and
through
thick
drifts
old
leaves
and
all
about
them
the
rain
pattered
and
trickled
They
did
not
talk
but
kept
glancing
back
and
from
side
side
After
half
hour
Pippin
said
hope
have
not
turned
too
much
towards
the
south
and
are
not
walking
longwise
through
this
wood
not
very
broad
belt
should
have
said
more
than
mile
the
widest
and
ought
have
been
through
now
good
our
starting
zig
zags
said
Frodo
That
won
mend
matters
Let
keep
are
going
not
sure
that
want
come
out
into
the
open
yet
They
went
for
perhaps
another
couple
miles
Then
the
sun
gleamed
out
ragged
clouds
again
and
the
rain
lessened
was
now
past
mid
day
and
they
felt
was
high
time
for
lunch
They
halted
under
elm
tree
its
leaves
though
fast
turning
yellow
were
still
thick
and
the
ground
its
feet
was
fairly
dry
and
sheltered
When
they
came
make
their
meal
they
found
that
the
Elves
had
filled
their
bottles
with
clear
drink
pale
golden
colour
had
the
scent
honey
made
many
flowers
and
was
wonderfully
refreshing
Very
soon
they
were
laughing
and
snapping
their
fingers
rain
and
Black
Riders
The
last
few
miles
they
felt
would
soon
behind
them
Frodo
propped
his
back
against
the
tree
trunk
and
closed
his
eyes
Sam
and
Pippin
sat
near
and
they
began
hum
and
then
sing
softly
the
bottle
heal
heart
and
drown
woe
Rain
may
fall
and
wind
may
blow
And
many
miles
still
But
under
tall
tree
will
lie
And
let
the
clouds
sailing
they
began
again
louder
They
stopped
short
suddenly
Frodo
sprang
his
feet
long
drawn
wail
came
down
the
wind
like
the
cry
some
evil
and
lonely
creature
rose
and
fell
and
ended
high
piercing
note
Even
they
sat
and
stood
suddenly
frozen
was
answered
another
cry
fainter
and
further
off
but
less
chilling
the
blood
There
was
then
silence
broken
only
the
sound
the
wind
the
leaves
And
what
you
think
that
was
Pippin
asked
last
trying
speak
lightly
but
quavering
little
was
bird
was
one
that
never
heard
the
Shire
before
SHORT
CUT
MUSHROOMS
was
not
bird
beast
said
Frodo
was
call
signal
there
were
words
that
cry
though
could
not
catch
them
But
hobbit
has
such
voice
more
was
said
about
They
were
all
thinking
the
Riders
but
one
spoke
them
They
were
now
reluctant
either
stay
but
sooner
later
they
had
got
get
across
the
open
country
the
Ferry
and
was
best
sooner
and
daylight
few
moments
they
had
shouldered
their
packs
again
and
were
off
Before
long
the
wood
came
sudden
end
Wide
grass
lands
stretched
before
them
They
now
saw
that
they
had
fact
turned
too
much
the
south
Away
over
the
flats
they
could
glimpse
the
low
hill
Bucklebury
across
the
River
but
was
now
their
left
Creeping
cautiously
out
from
the
edge
the
trees
they
set
off
across
the
open
quickly
they
could
first
they
felt
afraid
away
from
the
shelter
the
wood
Far
back
behind
them
stood
the
high
place
where
they
had
breakfasted
Frodo
half
expected
see
the
small
distant
figure
horseman
the
ridge
dark
against
the
sky
but
there
was
sign
one
The
sun
escaping
from
the
breaking
clouds
sank
towards
the
hills
they
had
left
was
now
shining
brightly
again
Their
fear
left
them
though
they
still
felt
uneasy
But
the
land
became
steadily
more
tame
and
well
ordered
Soon
they
came
into
well
tended
fields
and
meadows
there
were
hedges
and
gates
and
dikes
for
drainage
Everything
seemed
quiet
and
peaceful
just
ordinary
corner
the
Shire
Their
spirits
rose
with
every
step
The
line
the
River
grew
nearer
and
the
Black
Riders
began
seem
like
phantoms
the
woods
now
left
far
behind
They
passed
along
the
edge
huge
turnip
field
and
came
stout
gate
Beyond
rutted
lane
ran
between
low
well
laid
hedges
towards
distant
clump
trees
Pippin
stopped
know
these
fields
and
this
gate
said
This
Bamfurlong
old
Farmer
Maggot
land
That
his
farm
away
there
the
trees
One
trouble
after
another
said
Frodo
looking
nearly
much
alarmed
Pippin
had
declared
the
lane
was
the
slot
leading
dragon
den
The
others
looked
him
surprise
What
wrong
with
old
Maggot
asked
Pippin
good
friend
all
the
Brandybucks
course
terror
trespassers
and
keeps
ferocious
dogs
but
after
all
folk
down
here
are
near
the
border
and
have
more
their
guard
know
said
Frodo
But
all
the
same
added
with
shame
faced
laugh
terrified
him
and
his
dogs
have
avoided
his
farm
for
years
and
years
caught
several
times
trespassing
after
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
mushrooms
when
was
youngster
Brandy
Hall
the
last
occasion
beat
and
then
took
and
showed
his
dogs
See
lads
said
next
time
this
young
varmint
sets
foot
land
you
can
eat
him
Now
see
him
off
They
chased
all
the
way
the
Ferry
have
never
got
over
the
fright
though
daresay
the
beasts
knew
their
business
and
would
not
really
have
touched
Pippin
laughed
Well
time
you
made
Especially
you
are
coming
back
live
Buckland
Old
Maggot
really
stout
fellow
you
leave
his
mushrooms
alone
Let
get
into
the
lane
and
then
shan
trespassing
meet
him
the
talking
friend
Merry
and
used
come
here
with
him
good
deal
one
time
They
went
along
the
lane
until
they
saw
the
thatched
roofs
large
house
and
farm
buildings
peeping
out
among
the
trees
ahead
The
Maggots
and
the
Puddifoots
Stock
and
most
the
inhabi
tants
the
Marish
were
house
dwellers
and
this
farm
was
stoutly
built
brick
and
had
high
wall
all
round
There
was
wide
wooden
gate
opening
out
the
wall
into
the
lane
Suddenly
they
drew
nearer
terrific
baying
and
barking
broke
out
and
loud
voice
was
heard
shouting
Grip
Fang
Wolf
Come
lads
Frodo
and
Sam
stopped
dead
but
Pippin
walked
few
paces
The
gate
opened
and
three
huge
dogs
came
pelting
out
into
the
lane
and
dashed
towards
the
travellers
barking
fiercely
They
took
notice
Pippin
but
Sam
shrank
against
the
wall
while
two
wolvish
looking
dogs
sniffed
him
suspiciously
and
snarled
moved
The
largest
and
most
ferocious
the
three
halted
front
Frodo
bristling
and
growling
Through
the
gate
there
now
appeared
broad
thick
set
hobbit
with
round
red
face
Hallo
Hallo
And
who
may
you
and
what
may
you
wanting
asked
Good
afternoon
Maggot
said
Pippin
The
farmer
looked
him
closely
Well
isn
Master
Pippin
Peregrin
Took
should
say
cried
changing
from
scowl
grin
long
time
since
saw
you
round
here
lucky
for
you
that
know
you
was
just
going
out
set
dogs
any
strangers
There
are
some
funny
things
going
today
course
get
queer
folk
wandering
these
parts
times
Too
near
the
River
said
shaking
his
head
But
this
fellow
was
the
most
outlandish
have
ever
set
eyes
won
cross
land
without
leave
second
time
not
can
stop
What
fellow
you
mean
asked
Pippin
SHORT
CUT
MUSHROOMS
Then
you
haven
seen
him
said
the
farmer
went
the
lane
towards
the
causeway
not
long
while
back
was
funny
customer
and
asking
funny
questions
But
perhaps
you
come
along
inside
and
pass
the
news
more
comfortable
drop
good
ale
tap
you
and
your
friends
are
willing
Took
seemed
plain
that
the
farmer
would
tell
them
more
allowed
his
own
time
and
fashion
they
all
accepted
the
invitation
What
about
the
dogs
asked
Frodo
anxiously
The
farmer
laughed
They
won
harm
you
not
unless
tell
Here
Grip
Fang
Heel
cried
Heel
Wolf
the
relief
Frodo
and
Sam
the
dogs
walked
away
and
let
them
free
Pippin
introduced
the
other
two
the
farmer
Frodo
Baggins
said
You
may
not
remember
him
but
used
live
Brandy
Hall
the
name
Baggins
the
farmer
started
and
gave
Frodo
sharp
glance
For
moment
Frodo
thought
that
the
memory
stolen
mushrooms
had
been
aroused
and
that
the
dogs
would
told
see
him
off
But
Farmer
Maggot
took
him
the
arm
Well
that
isn
queerer
than
ever
exclaimed
Baggins
Come
inside
must
have
talk
They
went
into
the
farmer
kitchen
and
sat
the
wide
fire
place
Mrs
Maggot
brought
out
beer
huge
jug
and
filled
four
large
mugs
was
good
brew
and
Pippin
found
himself
more
than
compensated
for
missing
the
Golden
Perch
Sam
sipped
his
beer
sus
piciously
had
natural
mistrust
the
inhabitants
other
parts
the
Shire
and
also
was
not
disposed
quick
friends
with
anyone
who
had
beaten
his
master
however
long
ago
After
few
remarks
about
the
weather
and
the
agricultural
pros
pects
which
were
worse
than
usual
Farmer
Maggot
put
down
his
mug
and
looked
them
all
turn
Now
Peregrin
said
where
might
you
coming
from
and
where
might
you
going
Were
you
coming
visit
For
you
had
gone
past
gate
without
seeing
you
Well
answered
Pippin
tell
you
the
truth
since
you
have
guessed
got
into
the
lane
from
the
other
end
had
come
over
your
fields
But
that
was
quite
accident
lost
our
way
the
woods
back
near
Woodhall
trying
take
short
cut
the
Ferry
you
were
hurry
the
road
would
have
served
you
better
said
the
farmer
But
wasn
worrying
about
that
You
have
leave
walk
over
land
you
have
mind
Peregrin
And
you
Baggins
though
daresay
you
still
like
mushrooms
laughed
yes
recognized
the
name
recollect
the
time
when
young
Frodo
Baggins
was
one
the
worst
young
rascals
Buckland
But
wasn
mushrooms
was
thinking
had
just
heard
the
name
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Baggins
before
you
turned
What
you
think
that
funny
customer
asked
They
waited
anxiously
for
him
Well
the
farmer
con
tinued
approaching
his
point
with
slow
relish
came
riding
big
black
horse
the
gate
which
happened
open
and
right
door
All
black
was
himself
too
and
cloaked
and
hooded
did
not
want
known
Now
what
the
Shire
can
want
thought
myself
don
see
many
the
Big
Folk
over
the
border
and
anyway
had
never
heard
any
like
this
black
fellow
Good
day
you
says
going
out
him
This
lane
don
lead
anywhere
and
wherever
you
may
going
your
quickest
way
will
back
the
road
didn
like
the
looks
him
and
when
Grip
came
out
took
one
sniff
and
let
out
yelp
had
been
stung
put
down
his
tail
and
bolted
off
howling
The
black
fellow
sat
quite
still
come
from
yonder
said
slow
and
stiff
like
pointing
back
west
over
fields
you
please
Have
you
seen
Baggins
asked
queer
voice
and
bent
down
towards
could
not
see
any
face
for
his
hood
fell
down
low
and
felt
sort
shiver
down
back
But
did
not
see
why
should
come
riding
over
land
bold
off
said
There
are
Bagginses
here
You
the
wrong
part
the
Shire
You
had
better
back
west
Hobbiton
but
you
can
road
this
time
Baggins
has
left
answered
whisper
coming
not
far
away
wish
find
him
passes
will
you
tell
will
come
back
with
gold
Nlo

won
said
You
back
where
you
belong
double
quick
give
you
one
minute
before
call
all
dogs
gave
sort
hiss
might
have
been
laughing
and
might
not
Then
spurred
his
great
horse
right
and
jumped
out
the
way
only
just
time
called
the
dogs
but
swung
off
and
rode
through
the
gate
and
the
lane
towards
the
causeway
like
bolt
thunder
What
you
think
that
Frodo
sat
for
moment
looking
the
fire
but
his
only
thought
was
how
earth
would
they
reach
the
Ferry
don
know
what
think
said
last
Then
tell
you
what
think
said
Maggot
You
should
never
have
gone
mixing
yourself
with
Hobbiton
folk
Frodo
Folk
are
queer
there
Sam
stirred
his
chair
and
looked
the
farmer
with
unfriendly
eye
But
you
were
always
reckless
lad
When
heard
you
had
left
the
Brandybucks
and
gone
off
that
old
Bilbo
said
that
you
were
going
find
trouble
Mark
words
SHORT
CUT
MUSHROOMS
this
all
comes
those
strange
doings
Bilbo
His
money
was
got
some
strange
fashion
foreign
parts
they
say
Maybe
there
some
that
want
know
what
has
become
the
gold
and
jewels
that
buried
the
hill
Hobbiton
hear
Frodo
said
nothing
the
shrewd
guesses
the
farmer
were
rather
disconcerting
Well
Frodo
Maggot
went
glad
that
you
had
the
sense
come
back
Buckland
advice
stay
there
And
don
get
mixed
with
these
outlandish
folk
You

parts

black
fellows

you
again
Ill

with
them
Ill

And
that

not
old
Bilbo

want
news
Maybe
you
right
said
Frodo
avoiding
the
farmer
eye
and
staring
the
fire
Maggot
looked
him
thoughtfully
Well
see
you
have
ideas
your
own
said
plain
nose
that
accident
brought
you
and
that
rider
here
the
same
afternoon

great
news

after
all
not
asking
you

anything
you
have
mind

yourself
but
see

said
Frodo
But

Thank

years
Farmer
Maggot

And

Maggot

waggon
and

the
Ferry
That

good
step
and

also
save
you
trouble
another
sort
Frodo
now
accepted
the
invitation
gratefully
the
relief
Pippin
and
Sam
The
sun
was
already
behind
the
western
hills
and
the
light
was
failing
Two
Maggot
sons
and
his
three
daughters
came
and
generous
supper
was
laid
the
large
table
The
kitchen
was
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
lit
with
candles
and
the
fire
was
mended
Mrs
Maggot
bustled
and
out
One
two
other
hobbits
belonging
the
farm
household
came
short
while
fourteen
sat
down
eat
There
was
beer
plenty
and
mighty
dish
mushrooms
and
bacon
besides
much
other
solid
farmhouse
fare
The
dogs
lay
the
fire
and
gnawed
rinds
and
cracked
bones
When
they
had
finished
the
farmer
and
his
sons
went
out
with
lantern
and
got
the
waggon
ready
was
dark
the
yard
when
the
guests
came
out
They
threw
their
packs
board
and
climbed
The
farmer
sat
the
driving
seat
and
whipped
his
two
stout
ponies
His
wife
stood
the
light
the
open
door
You
careful
yourself
Maggot
she
called
Don
arguing
with
any
foreigners
and
come
straight
back
will
said
and
drove
out
the
gate
There
was

stirring
the
night
was
still
and
quiet
and
chill
was
the
air
They
went
without
lights
and
took
slowly
After
mile
two
the
lane
came
end
crossing
deep
dike
and
climbing
short
slope
the
high
banked
causeway
Maggot
got
down
and
took
good
look
either
way
north
and
south
but
nothing
could
seen
the
darkness
and
there
was
not
sound
the
still
air
Thin
strands

were
hanging
above
the
dikes
and
crawling
over
the
fields
going

Maggot
but
not

long
before
Meet

five
miles
more
from

lane
the
Ferry
The
hobbits
wrapped
themselves
but
their
ears
were
strained
for
any
sound
above
the
creak
the
wheels
and
the
slow
clop
the
ponies
hoofs
The
waggon
seemed
slower
than
snail
Frodo
Beside
him
Pippin
was
nodding
towards
sleep
but
Sam
was
staring
forwards
into
the
rising
fog
They
reached
the
entrance
the
Ferry
lane
last
was
marked
two
tall
white
posts
that
suddenly
loomed
their
right
Farmer
Maggot
drew
his
ponies
and
the
waggon
creaked
halt
They
were
just
beginning
scramble
out
when
suddenly
they
heard
what
they
had
all
been
dreading
hoofs
the
road
ahead
The
sound
was
coming
towards
them
Maggot
jumped
down
and
stood
holding
the
ponies
heads
and
peering
forward
into
the
gloom
Clip

came
the
approach

The
fall
the
hoofs
sounded
loud
the
still
foggy
air
You
better
hidden
Frodo
said
Sam
anxiously
You
get
down
the
waggon
and
cover
with
blankets
and

The

was
nearly

Hallo
there
called
Farmer
Maggot
The
advancing

stopped
short
They
thought
they
could
dimly
guess

the

two
ahead
Now
then
said
the
farmer
throwing
the
reins
Sam
and
striding
forward
Don

come
step
nearer
What
you
want
and
where

uncovered
and
its

the

Merry
cried
Yes

Who

said
Merry
coming
forward
came
out
the
mist
and
their
fears
subsided
seemed
suddenly

Frodo
sprang
out
the
waggon

him
there

said
Merry
was
beginning
wonder
you
would
turn
all
today
and
was
just
going
back

When
grew
foggy
came
across
and
rode
towards
Stock
see
you
had
fallen
any
ditches
But
blest

which

Where

the

and
nearly

Now

Merry
and
Frodo
and
all

backed
the

into
the
lane
and
turned
Well
good

queer
day
and
mistake
But
all
well
ends
well
though
perhaps

Pll
not

They
watched
the
pale

round
his

dwindled
into

Suddenly
Frodo

CONSPIRACY

Now
had
better
get
home
ourselves
said
Merry
There
some
thing
funny
about
all
this
see
but
must
wait
till
get
They
turned
down
the
Ferry
lane
which
was
straight
and
well
kept
and
edged
with
large
white
washed
stones
hundred
yards
brought
them
the
river
bank
where
there
was
broad
wooden
landing
stage
large
flat
ferry
boat
was
moored
beside
The
white
bollards
near
the
water
edge
glimmered
the
light
two
lamps
high
posts
Behind
them
the
mists
the
flat
fields
were
now
above
the
hedges
but
the
water
before
them
was
dark
with
only
few
curling
wisps
like
steam
among
the
reeds
the
bank
There
seemed
less
fog
the
further
side
Merry
led
the
pony
over
gangway
the
ferry
and
the
others
followed
Merry
then
pushed
slowly
off
with
long
pole
The
Brandy
wine
flowed
slow
and
broad
before
them
the
other
side
the
bank
was
steep
and
winding
path
climbed
from
the
further
landing
Lamps
were
twinkling
there
Behind
loomed
the
Buck
Hill
and
out
through
stray
shrouds
mist
shone
many
round
windows

They
were

the

indeed
the

had
crossed
the

which
was
the

boundary
the

eastwards
built
and
excavated
Brandy
Hall
changed
his
name
Brandybuck
and
settled
down
become
master
what
was
virtually
small
independent
country
His
family
grew
and
grew
and
after
his
days
continued
grow
until
Brandy
Hall
occupied
the
whole
the
low
hill
and
had
three
large
front
doors
many
side
doors
and
about
hundred
windows
The
Brandybucks
and
their
numerous
dependants
then
began

and
later
build

the
Bucklanders
peculiar
half
foreigners
were
Though
matter
fact
they
were
not
very
different
from
the
other
hobbits
the
Four
Farthings
Except
one
point
they
were
fond
boats
and
some
them
could
swim
Their
land
was
originally
unprotected
from
the
East
but
that
side
they
had
built

High
Hay

been

from

where
the
Withywindle
flowed
out
the

into
the
Brandywine
well
over
twenty
miles
from

But
course
was
not
complete
protection
The
Forest
drew
close
the
hedge
many
places
The
Bucklanders
kept
their
doors
locked
after
dark
and
that
also
was
not
usual
the
Shire
The
ferry
boat
moved
slowly
across
the
water
The
Buckland
shore
drew
nearer
Sam
was
the
only
member
the
party
who
had
not
been
over
the
river
before
had
strange
feeling
the
slow
gurgling
stream
slipped
his
old
life
lay
behind
the
mists
dark
adventure
lay
front
scratched
his
head
and
for
moment
had
passing
wish
that
Frodo
could
have
gone
living
quietly
Bag
End
The
four
hobbits
stepped
off
the
ferry
Merry
was
tying
and
Pippin
was
already
leading
the
pony
the
path
when
Sam
who
had
been
looking
back
take
farewell
the
Shire
said
hoarse
whisper
Look
back
Frodo
you
see
anything
the
far
stage
under
the
distant
lamps
they
could
just
make
out
figure
looked
like
dark
black
bundle
left
behind
But
they
looked
seemed
move
and
sway
this
way
and
that
searching
the
ground
then
crawled
went
crouching
back
into
the
gloom
beyond
the
lamps
What
the
Shire
that
exclaimed
Merry
Something
that
following
said
Frodo
But
don
ask
any
more
now
Let
get
away
once
They
hurried
the
path
the
top
the
bank
but
when
they
looked
back
the
far
shore
was
shrouded
mist
and
nothing
could
seen
Thank
goodness
you
don
keep
any
boats
the
west
bank
said
Frodo
Can
horses
cross
the
river
They
can
ten
miles
north
Brandywine
Bridge
they
might
swim
answered
Merry
Though
never
heard
any
horse
swimming
the
Brandywine
But
what
have
horses
with
tell
you
later
Let
get
indoors
and
then
can
talk
All
right
You
and
Pippin
know
your
way
just
ride

Frodo
but

Merry
and

They
passed

struck

ran
south
from

Half

along
this
they
came

from

Brandy
Hall
for
time
was
old
fashioned
countrified
house
much
like

hole
possible
was
long
and
low
with

and
had

round

and
large

they
walked
the
green

from
the

light
was
visible
the
windows
were
dark
and
shuttered
Frodo
knocked
the
door
and
Fatty

opened

out
They
slipped
quickly
and

Well

After

Frodo
looked

did
look

Many

reminded
him

and
found
himself
wishing
that
was
really
coming
here
settle
down
quiet
retirement
seemed
unfair
have
put
his
friends
all
this
trouble
and
wondered
again
how
was
going
break
the
news
them
that
must
leave
them
soon
indeed
once
Yet
that
would
have
done

with

The

hung
their

and
piled
their

Merry
led
them
down

full
boiling
water
There
are
also

Get
inside
and
quick
Merry
and
Fatty
went
into
the
kitchen
the
other
side
the
passage
and
busied
themselves
with
the
final
preparations
for
late
supper
Snatches
competing
songs
came
from
the
bathroom
mixed
with
the
sound
splashing
and
wallowing
The

Pippin
was
suddenly
lifted
above

went
the

What
about

called

out
drying

There

Lawks
said
Merry
looking
The
stone
floor
was
swimming
You
ought
mop
all
that
before
you
get

Peregrin
said
Hurry
shan
wait
for

They

Fredegar
without
much

Yes

Pippin
They

said
Frodo
Given
Mrs

among

Take
your

hands
away
and
serve
them
Hobbits
have
passion
for
mushrooms
surpassing
even
the
greediest
likings
Big

fact
which
partly
explains
young
Frodo
long
expeditions
the
renowned
fields
the
Marish
and
the
wrath
the
injured
Maggot
this
occasion
there
was
plenty
for
all
even
according
hobbit
standards
There
were
also
many
other
things
follow
and
when
they
had
finished
even
Fatty
Bolger
heaved
sigh
content
They
pushed
back
the
table
and
drew
chairs
round
the
fire
clear
later
said
Merry
Now
tell
all
about
guess
that
you
have
been
having
adventures
which
was
not
quite
fair
without
want
full
account
and
most
all
want
know
what
was
the
matter
with
old
Maggot
and
why
spoke
like
that
sounded
almost
was
scared
that
possible
have
all
been
scared
said
Pippin
after
pause
which
Frodo
stared
the
fire
and
did
not
speak
You
would
have
been
too
you
had
been
chased
for
two
days
Black
Riders
And
what
are
they
Black
figures
riding
black
horses
answered
Pippin
Frodo
won
talk
will
tell
you
the
whole
tale
from
the
beginning
then
gave
full
account
their
journey
from
the
time
when
they
left
Hobbiton
Sam
gave
various
supporting
nods
and
exclamations
Frodo
remained
silent
should
think
you
were
making
all
said
Merry
had
not
seen
that
black
shape
the
landing
stage
and
heard
the
queer
sound
Maggot
voice
What
you
make
all
Frodo
Cousin
Frodo
has
been
very
close
said
Pippin
But
the
time
has
come
for
him
open
out
far
have
been
given
nothing
more
than
Farmer
Maggot
guess
that
has
something
with
old
Bilbo
treasure
CONSPIRACY

103
That
was
only
guess
said
Frodo
hastily
Maggot
does
not
know
anything
Old
Maggot
shrewd
fellow
said
Merry
lot
goes
behind
his
round
face
that
does
not
come
out
his
talk
heard
that
used
into
the
Old
Forest
one
time
and
has
the
reputation
knowing
good
many
strange
things
But
you
can
least
tell
Frodo
whether
you
think
his
guess
good
bad
think
answered
Frodo
slowly
that
was
good
guess
far
goes
There
connexion
with
Bilbo
old
adventures
and
the
Riders
are
looking
perhaps
one
ought
say
searching
for
him
for
also
fear
you
want
know
that
joke
all
and
that
not
safe
here
anywhere
else
looked
round
the
windows
and
walls
was
afraid
they
would
suddenly
give
way
The
others
looked
him
silence
and
exchanged
meaning
glances
among
themselves
coming
out
minute
whispered
Pippin
Merry
Merry
nodded
Well
said
Frodo
last
sitting
and
straightening
his
back
had
made
decision
can
keep
dark
any
longer
have
got
something
tell
you
all
But
don
know
quite
how
begin
think
could
help
you
said
Merry
quietly
telling
you
some
myself
What
you
mean
said
Frodo
looking
him
anxiously
Just
this
dear
old
Frodo
you
are
miserable
because
you
don
know
how
say
good
bye
You
meant
leave
the
Shire
course
But
danger
has
come
you
sooner
than
you
expected
and
now
you
are
making
your
mind
once
And
you
don
want
are
very
sorry
for
you
Frodo
opened
his
mouth
and
shut
again
His
look
surprise
was
comical
that
they
laughed
Dear
old
Frodo
said
Pippin
Did
you
really
think
you
had
thrown
dust
all
our
eyes
You
have
not
been
nearly
careful
clever
enough
for
that
You
have
obviously
been
planning
and
saying
farewell
all
your
haunts
all
this
year
since
April
have
constantly
heard
you
muttering
Shall
ever
look
down
into
that
valley
again
wonder
and
things
like
that
And
pretending
that
you
had
come
the
end
your
money
and
actually
selling
your
beloved
Bag
End
those
Sackville
Bagginses
And
all
those
close
talks
with
Gandalf
Good
heavens
said
Frodo
thought
had
been
both
careful
and
clever
don
know
what
Gandalf
would
say
all
the
Shire
discussing
departure
then
said
Merry
Don
worry
about
that
The
secret
won
keep
for
long
course
but
present
think
only
known
conspirators
After
all
you
must
remember
that
know
you
well
104
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
and
are
often
with
you
can
usually
guess
what
you
are
thinking
knew
Bilbo
too
tell
you
the
truth
have
been
watching
you
rather
closely
ever
since
left
thought
you
would
after
him
sooner
later
indeed
expected
you
sooner
and
lately
have
been
very
anxious
have
been
terrified
that
you
might
give
the
slip
and
off
suddenly
all
your
own
like
did
Ever
since
this
spring
have
kept
our
eyes
open
and
done
good
deal
planning
our
own
account
You
are
not
going
escape
easily
But
must
said
Frodo
cannot
helped
dear
friends
wretched
for
all
but
use
your
trying
keep
Since
you
have
guessed
much
please
help
and
not
hinder
You
not
understand
said
Pippin
You
must
and
there
fore
must
too
Merry
and
are
coming
with
you
Sam
excellent
fellow
and
would
jump
down
dragon
throat
save
you
did
not
trip
over
his
own
feet
but
you
will
need
more
than
one
companion
your
dangerous
adventure
dear
and
most
beloved
hobbits
said
Frodo
deeply
moved
But
could
not
allow
decided
that
long
ago
too
You
speak
danger
but
you
not
understand
This
treasure
hunt
there
and
back
journey
flying
from
deadly
peril
into
deadly
peril
course
understand
said
Merry
firmly
That
why
have
decided
come
know
the
Ring
laughing
matter
but
are
going
our
best
help
you
against
the
Enemy
The
Ring
said
Frodo
now
completely
amazed
Yes
the
Ring
said
Merry
dear
old
hobbit
you
don
allow
for
the
inquisitiveness
friends
have
known
about
the
existence
the
Ring
for
years
before
Bilbo
went
away
fact
but
since
obviously
regarded
secret
kept
the
knowledge
head
until
formed
our
conspiracy
did
not
know
Bilbo
course
well
know
you
was
too
young
and
was
also
more
careful
but
was
not
careful
enough
you
want
know
how
first
found
out
will
tell
you
said
Frodo
faintly
was
the
Sackville
Bagginses
that
were
his
downfall
you
might
expect
One
day
year
before
the
Party
happened
walking
along
the
road
when
saw
Bilbo
ahead
Suddenly
the
distance
the
appeared
coming
towards
Bilbo
slowed
down
and
then
hey
presto
vanished
was
startled
that
hardly
had
the
wits
hide
myself
more
ordinary
fashion
but
got
through
the
hedge
and
walked
along
the
field
inside
was
peeping
through
into
the
road
after
the
had
passed
and
was
looking
straight
Bilbo
when
suddenly
reappeared
caught
glint
gold
put
something
back
his
trouser
pocket
CONSPIRACY
UNMASKED
105
After
that
kept
eyes
open
fact
confess
that
spied
But
you
must
admit
that
was
very
intriguing
and
was
only
teens
must
the
only
one
the
Shire
besides
you
Frodo
that
has
ever
seen
the
old
fellow
secret
book
You
have
read
his
book
cried
Frodo
Good
heavens
above
nothing
safe
Not
too
safe
should
say
said
Merry
But
have
only
had
one
rapid
glance
and
that
was
difficult
get
never
left
the
book
about
wonder
what
became
should
like
another
look
Have
you
got
Frodo
was
not
Bag
End
must
have
taken
away
Well
was
saying
Merry
proceeded
kept
knowledge
myself
till
this
spring
when
things
got
serious
Then
formed
our
conspiracy
and
were
serious
too
and
meant
business
have
not
been
too
scrupulous
You
are
not
very
easy
nut
crack
and
Gandalf
worse
But
you
want
introduced
our
chief
investigator
can
produce
him
Where
said
Frodo
looking
round
expected
masked
and
sinister
figure
come
out
cupboard
Step
forward
Sam
said
Merry
and
Sam
stood
with
face
scarlet
the
ears
Here
our
collector
information
And
collected
lot
can
tell
you
before
was
finally
caught
After
which
may
say
seemed
regard
himself
parole
and
dried
Sam
cried
Frodo
feeling
that
amazement
could
further
and
quite
unable
decide
whether
felt
angry
amused
relieved
merely
foolish
Yes
sir
said
Sam
Begging
your
pardon
sir
But
meant
wrong
you
Frodo
nor
Gandalf
for
that
matter
has
some
sense
mind
you
and
when
you
said
alone
said
take
someone
you
can
trust
But
does
not
seem
that
can
trust
anyone
said
Frodo
Sam
looked
him
unhappily
all
depends
what
you
want
put
Merry
You
can
trust
stick
you
through
thick
and
thin
the
bitter
end
And
you
can
trust
keep
any
secret
yours
closer
than
you
keep
yourself
But
you
cannot
trust
let
you
face
trouble
alone
and
off
without
word
are
your
friends
Frodo
Anyway
there
know
most
what
Gandalf
has
told
you
know
good
deal
about
the
Ring
are
horribly
afraid
but
are
coming
with
you
following
you
like
hounds
And
after
all
sir
added
Sam
you
did
ought
take
the
Elves
advice
Gildor
said
you
should
take
them
was
willing
and
you
can
deny
don
deny
said
Frodo
looking
Sam
who
was
now
106
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
grinning
don
deny
but
never
believe
you
are
sleeping
again
whether
you
snore
not
shall
kick
you
hard
make
sure
You
are
set
deceitful
scoundrels
said
turning
the
others
But
bless
you
laughed
getting
and
waving
his
arms
give
will
take
Gildor
advice
the
danger
were
not
dark
should
dance
for
joy
Even
cannot
help
feeling
happy
happier
than
have
felt
for
long
time
had
dreaded
this
evening
Good
That
settled
Three
cheers
for
Captain
Frodo
and
com
pany
they
shouted
and
they
danced
round
him
Merry
and
Pippin
began
song
which
they
had
apparently
got
ready
for
the
occasion
was
made
the
model
the
dwarf
song
that
started
Bilbo
his
adventure
long
ago
and
went
the
same
tune
Farewell
call
hearth
and
hall
Though
wind
may
blow
and
rain
may
fall
must
away
ere
break
day
Far
over
wood
and
mountain
tall
Rivendell
where
Elves
yet
dwell
glades
beneath
the
misty
fell
Through
moor
and
waste
ride
haste
And
whither
then
cannot
tell
With
foes
ahead
behind
dread
Beneath
the
sky
shall
our
bed
Until
last
our
toil
passed
Our
journey
done
our
errand
sped
must
away
must
away
ride
before
the
break
day
Very
good
said
Frodo
But
that
case
there
are
lot
things
before
bed
under
roof
for
tonight
any
rate
That
was
poetry
said
Pippin
you
really
mean
start
before
the
break
day
don
know
answered
Frodo
fear
those
Black
Riders
and
sure
unsafe
stay
one
place
long
especially
place
which
known
was
going
Also
Gildor
advised
not
wait
But
should
very
much
like
see
Gandalf
could
see
that
even
Gildor
was
disturbed
when
heard
that
Gandalf
had
never
appeared
really
depends
two
things
How
soon
could
the
Riders
get
Bucklebury
And
how
soon
could
get
off
will
take
good
deal
preparation
The
answer
the
second
question
said
Merry
that
could
CONSPIRACY
UNMASKED
I07
get
off
hour
have
prepared
practically
everything
There
are
five
ponies
stable
across
the
fields
stores
and
tackle
are
all
packed
except
for
few
extra
clothes
and
the
perishable
food
seems
have
been
very
efficient
conspiracy
said
Frodo
But
what
about
the
Black
Riders
Would
safe
wait
one
day
for
Gandalf
That
all
depends
what
you
think
the
Riders
would
they
found
you
here
answered
Merry
They
could
have
reached
here
now
course
they
were
not
stopped
the
North
gate
where
the
Hedge
runs
down
the
river
bank
just
this
side
the
Bridge
The
gate
guards
would
not
let
them
through
night
though
they
might
break
through
Even
the
daylight
they
would
try
keep
them
out
think
any
rate
until
they
got
message
through
the
Master
the
Hall
for
they
would
not
like
the
look
the
Riders
and
would
certainly
frightened
them
But
course
Buckland
cannot
resist
determined
attack
for
long
And
possible
that
the
morning
even
Black
Rider
that
rode
and
asked
for
Baggins
would
let
through
pretty
generally
known
that
you
are
coming
back
live
Crickhollow
Frodo
sat
for
while
thought
have
made
mind
said
finally
starting
tomorrow
soon
light
But
not
going
road
would
safer
wait
here
than
that
through
the
North
gate
departure
from
Buckland
will
known
once
instead
being
secret
for
several
days
least
might
And
what
more
the
Bridge
and
the
East
Road
near
the
borders
will
certainly
watched
whether
any
Rider
gets
into
Buckland
not
don
know
how
many
there
are
but
there
are
least
two
and
possibly
more
The
only
thing
off
quite
unexpected
direction
But
that
can
only
mean
going
into
the
Old
Forest
said
Fredegar
horrified
You
can
thinking
doing
that
quite
dangerous
Black
Riders
Not
quite
said
Merry
sounds
very
desperate
but
believe
Frodo
right
the
only
way
getting
off
without
being
followed
once
With
luck
might
get
considerable
start
But
you
won
have
any
luck
the
Old
Forest
objected
Fredegar
one
ever
has
luck
there
You
get
lost
People
don
there
yes
they
said
Merry
The
Brandybucks
occasion
ally
when
the
fit
takes
them
have
private
entrance
Frodo
went
once
long
ago
have
been
several
times
usually
daylight
course
when
the
trees
are
sleepy
and
fairly
quiet
Well
you
think
best
said
Fredegar
more
afraid
the
Old
Forest
than
anything
know
about
the
stories
about
are
nightmare
but
vote
hardly
counts
not
going
108
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
the
journey
Still
very
glad
someone
stopping
behind
who
can
tell
Gandalf
what
you
have
done
when
turns
sure
will
before
long
Fond
was
Frodo
Fatty
Bolger
had
desire
leave
the
Shire
nor
see
what
lay
outside
His
family
came
from
the
Eastfarthing
from
Budgeford
Bridgefields
fact
but
had
never
been
over
the
Brandywine
Bridge
His
task
according
the
original
plans
the
conspirators
was
stay
behind
and
deal
with
inquisitive
folk
and
keep
long
possible
the
pretence
that
Baggins
was
still
living
Crickhollow
had
even
brought
along
some
old
clothes
Frodo
help
him
playing
the
part
They
little
thought
how
dangerous
that
part
might
prove
Excellent
said
Frodo
when
understood
the
plan
could
not
have
left
any
message
behind
for
Gandalf
otherwise
don
know
whether
these
Riders
can
read
not
course
but
should
not
have
dared
risk
written
message
case
they
got
and
searched
the
house
But
Fatty
willing
hold
the
fort
and
can
sure
Gandalf
knowing
the
way
have
gone
that
decides
going
into
the
Old
Forest
first
thing
tomorrow
Well
that
that
said
Pippin
the
whole
would
rather
have
our
job
than
Fatty
waiting
here
till
Black
Riders
come
You
wait
till
you
are
well
inside
the
Forest
said
Fredegar
You
wish
you
were
back
here
with
before
this
time
tomorrow
good
arguing
about
any
more
said
Merry
have
still
got
tidy
and
put
the
finishing
touches
the
packing
before
get
bed
shall
call
you
all
before
the
break
day
When
last
had
got
bed
Frodo
could
not
sleep
for
some
time
His
legs
ached
was
glad
that
was
riding
the
morning
Eventually
fell
into
vague
dream
which
seemed
looking
out
high
window
over
dark
sea
tangled
trees
Down
below
among
the
roots
there
was
the
sound
creatures
crawling
and
snuffling
felt
sure
they
would
smell
him
out
sooner
later
Then
heard
noise
the
distance
first
thought
was
great
wind
coming
over
the
leaves
the
forest
Then
knew
that
was
not
leaves
but
the
sound
the
Sea
far
off
sound
had
never
heard
waking
life
though
had
often
troubled
his
dreams
Suddenly
found
was
out
the
open
There
were
trees
after
all
was
dark
heath
and
there
was
strange
salt
smell
the
air
Looking
saw
before
him
tall
white
tower
standing
alone
high
ridge
great
desire
came
over
him
climb
the
tower
and
see
the
Sea
started
struggle
the
ridge
towards
the
tower
but
suddenly
light
came
the
sky
and
there
was
noise
thunder
Chapter
THE
OLD
FOREST
Frodo
woke
suddenly
was
still
dark
the
room
Merry
was
stand
ing
there
with
candle
one
hand
and
banging
the
door
with
the
other
All
right
What
said
Frodo
still
shaken
and
bewildered
What
cried
Merry
time
get
half
past
four
and
very
foggy
Come
Sam
already
getting
breakfast
ready
Even
Pippin
just
going
saddle
the
ponies
and
fetch
the
one
that
the
baggage
carrier
Wake
that
sluggard
Fatty
least
must
get
and
see
off
Soon
after
six
clock
the
five
hobbits
were
ready
start
Fatty
Bolger
was
still
yawning
They
stole
quietly
out
the
house
Merry
went
front
leading
laden
pony
and
took
his
way
along
path
that
went
through
spinney
behind
the
house
and
then
cut
across
several
fields
The
leaves
trees
were
glistening
and
every
twig
was
dripping
the
grass
was
grey
with
cold
dew
Everything
was
still
and
far
away
noises
seemed
near
and
clear
fowls
chattering
yard
someone
closing
door
distant
house
their
shed
they
found
the
ponies
sturdy
little
beasts
the
kind
loved
hobbits
not
speedy
but
good
for
long
day
work
They
mounted
and
soon
they
were
riding
off
into
the
mist
which
seemed
open
reluctantly
before
them
and
close
forbiddingly
behind
them
After
riding
for
about
hour
slowly
and
without
talking
they
saw
the
Hedge
looming
suddenly
ahead
was
tall
and
netted
over
with
silver
cobwebs
How
are
you
going
get
through
this
asked
Fredegar
Follow
said
Merry
and
you
will
see
turned
the
left
along
the
Hedge
and
soon
they
came
point
where
bent
inwards
running
along
the
lip
hollow
cutting
had
been
made
some
distance
from
the
Hedge
and
went
sloping
gently
down
into
the
ground
had
walls
brick
the
sides
which
rose
steadily
until
suddenly
they
arched
over
and
formed
tunnel
that
dived
deep
under
the
Hedge
and
came
out
the
hollow
the
other
side
Here
Fatty
Bolger
halted
Good
bye
Frodo
said
wish
you
were
not
going
into
the
Forest
only
hope
you
will
not
need
rescu
ing
before
the
day
out
But
good
luck
you
today
and
every
day
there
are
worse
things
ahead
than
the
Old
Forest
shall
lucky
said
Frodo
Tell
Gandalf
hurry
along
the
East
Road
shall
soon
back
and
going
fast
can
Good
bye
IIO
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
they
cried
and
rode
down
the
slope
and
disappeared
from
Fredegar
sight
into
the
tunnel
was
dark
and
damp
the
far
end
was
closed
gate
thick
set
iron
bars
Merry
got
down
and
unlocked
the
gate
and
when
they
had
all
passed
through
pushed
again
shut
with
clang
and
the
lock
clicked
The
sound
was
ominous
There
said
Merry
You
have
left
the
Shire
and
are
now
outside
and
the
edge
the
Old
Forest
Are
the
stories
about
true
asked
Pippin
don
know
what
stories
you
mean
Merry
answered
you
mean
the
old
bogey
stories
Fatty
nurses
used
tell
him
about
goblins
and
wolves
and
things
that
sort
should
say
any
rate
don
believe
them
But
the
Forest
queer
Everything
very
much
more
alive
more
aware
what
going
speak
than
things
are
the
Shire
And
the
trees
not
like
strangers
They
watch
you
They
are
usually
content
merely
watch
you
long
daylight
lasts
and
don
much
Occasionally
the
most
unfriendly
ones
may
drop
branch
stick
root
out
grasp
you
with
long
trailer
But
night
things
can
most
alarming
told
have
only
once
twice
been
here
after
dark
and
then
only
near
the
hedge
thought
all
the
trees
were
whispering
each
other
passing
news
and
plots
along
unintelligible
language
and
the
branches
swayed
and
groped
without
any
wind
They
say
the
trees
actually
move
and
can
surround
strangers
and
hem
them
fact
long
ago
they
attacked
the
Hedge
they
came
and
planted
them
selves
right
and
leaned
over
But
the
hobbits
came
and
cut
down
hundreds
trees
and
made
great
bonfire
the
Forest
and
burned
all
the
ground
long
strip
east
the
Hedge
After
that
the
trees
gave
the
attack
but
they
became
very
unfriendly
There
still
wide
bare
space
not
far
inside
where
the
bonfire
was
made
only
the
trees
that
are
dangerous
asked
Pippin
There
are
various
queer
things
living
deep
the
Forest
and
the
far
side
said
Merry
least
have
heard
but
have
never
seen
any
them
But
something
makes
paths
Whenever
one
comes
inside
one
finds
open
tracks
but
they
seem
shift
and
change
from
time
time
queer
fashion
Not
far
from
this
tunnel
there
was
for
long
time
the
beginning
quite
broad
path
leading
the
Bonfire
Glade
and
then
more
less
our
direction
east
and
little
north
That
the
path
going
try
and
find
The
hobbits
now
left
the
tunnel
gate
and
rode
across
the
wide
hollow
the
far
side
was
faint
path
leading
the
floor
the
Forest
hundred
yards
and
more
beyond
the
Hedge
but
vanished
soon
brought
them
under
the
trees
Looking
back
they
THE
OLD
FOREST
III
could
see
the
dark
line
the
Hedge
through
the
stems
trees
that
were
already
thick
about
them
Looking
ahead
they
could
see
only
tree
trunks
innumerable
sizes
and
shapes
straight
bent
twisted
leaning
squat
slender
smooth
gnarled
and
branched
and
all
the
stems
were
green
grey
with
moss
and
slimy
shaggy
growths
Merry
alone
seemed
fairly
cheerful
You
had
better
lead
and
find
that
path
Frodo
said
him
Don
let
lose
one
another
forget
which
way
the
Hedge
lies
They
picked
way
among
the
trees
and
their
ponies
plodded
along
carefully
avoiding
the
many
writhing
and
interlacing
roots
There
was
undergrowth
The
ground
was
rising
steadily
and
they
went
forward
seemed
that
the
trees
became
taller
darker
and
thicker
There
was
sound
except
occasional
drip
moisture
falling
through
the
still
leaves
For
the
moment
there
was
whisper
ing
movement
among
the
branches
but
they
all
got
uncomfort
able
feeling
that
they
were
being
watched
with
disapproval
deepening
dislike
and
even
enmity
The
feeling
steadily
grew
until
they
found
themselves
looking
quickly
glancing
back
over
their
shoulders
they
expected
sudden
blow
There
was
not
yet
any
sign
path
and
the
trees
seemed
constantly
bar
their
way
Pippin
suddenly
felt
that
could
not
bear
any
longer
and
without
warning
let
out
shout
cried
not
going
anything
Just
let
pass
through
will
you
The
others
halted
startled
but
the
cry
fell
muffled
heavy
curtain
There
was
echo
answer
though
the
wood
seemed
become
more
crowded
and
more
watchful
than
before
should
not
shout
were
you
said
Merry
does
more
harm
than
good
Frodo
began
wonder
were
possible
find
way
through
and
had
been
right
make
the
others
come
into
this
abominable
wood
Merry
was
looking
from
side
side
and
seemed
already
uncertain
which
way
Pippin
noticed
has
not
taken
you
long
lose
said
But
that
moment
Merry
gave
whistle
relief
and
pointed
ahead
Well
well
said
These
trees
shift
There
the
Bonfire
Glade
front
hope
but
the
path
seems
have
moved
away
The
light
grew
clearer
they
went
forward
Suddenly
they
came
out
the
trees
and
found
themselves
wide
circular
space
There
was
sky
above
them
blue
and
clear
their
surprise
for
down
under
the
Forest
roof
they
had
not
been
able
see
the
rising
morning
and
the
lifting
the
mist
The
sun
was
not
however
high
enough
yet
II2
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
shine
down
into
the
clearing
though
its
light
was
the
tree
tops
The
leaves
were
all
thicker
and
greener
about
the
edges
the
glade
enclosing
with
almost
solid
wall
tree
grew
there
only
rough
grass
and
many
tall
plants
stalky
and
faded
hemlocks
and
wood
parsley
fire
weed
seeding
into
fluffy
ashes
and
rampant
nettles
and
thistles
dreary
place
but
seemed
charming
and
cheerful
garden
after
the
close
Forest
The
hobbits
felt
encouraged
and
looked
hopefully
the
broad
ening
daylight
the
sky
the
far
side
the
glade
there
was
break
the
wall
trees
and
clear
path
beyond
They
could
see
running
into
the
wood
wide
places
and
open
above
though
every
now
and
again
the
trees
drew
and
overshadowed
with
their
dark
boughs
this
path
they
rode
They
were
still
climbing
gently
but
they
now
went
much
quicker
and
with
better
heart
for
seemed
them
that
the
Forest
had
relented
and
was
going
let
them
pass
unhindered
after
all
But
after
while
the
air
began
get
hot
and
stuffy
The
trees
drew
close
again
either
side
and
they
could
longer
see
far
ahead
Now
stronger
than
ever
they
felt
again
the
ill
will
the
wood
pressing
them
silent
was
that
the
fall
their
ponies
hoofs
rustling
dead
leaves
and
occasionally
stumbling
hidden
roots
seemed
thud
their
ears
Frodo
tried
sing
song
encourage
them
but
his
voice
sank
murmur
Wanderers
the
shadowed
land
despair
not
For
though
dark
they
stand
all
woods
there
must
end
last
and
see
the
open
sun
past
the
setting
sun
the
rising
sun
the
day
end
the
day
begun
For
east
west
all
woods
must
fail
Fail
even
said
the
word
his
voice
faded
into
silence
The
air
seemed
heavy
and
the
making
words
wearisome
Just
behind
them
large
branch
fell
from
old
overhanging
tree
with
crash
into
the
path
The
trees
seemed
close
before
them
They
not
like
all
that
about
ending
and
failing
said
Merry
should
not
sing
any
more
present
Wait
till
get
the
edge
and
then
turn
and
give
them
rousing
chorus
spoke
cheerfully
and
felt
any
great
anxiety
did
not
show
The
others
did
not
answer
They
were
depressed
heavy
weight
was
settling
steadily
Frodo
heart
and
regretted
now
with
every
step
forward
that
had
ever
thought
challenging
the
menace
the
trees
was
indeed
just
about
stop
and
propose
THE
OLD
FOREST
II3
going
back
that
was
still
possible
when
things
took
new
turn
The
path
stopped
climbing
and
became
for
while
nearly
level
The
dark
trees
drew
aside
and
ahead
they
could
see
the
path
going
almost
straight
forward
Before
them
but
some
distance
off
there
stood
green
hill
top
treeless
rising
like
bald
head
out
the
encircling
wood
The
path
seemed
making
directly
for
They
now
hurried
forward
again
delighted
with
the
thought
climbing
out
for
while
above
the
roof
the
Forest
The
path
dipped
and
then
again
began
climb
upwards
leading
them
last
the
foot
the
steep
hillside
There
left
the
trees
and
faded
into
the
turf
The
wood
stood
all
round
the
hill
like
thick
hair
that
ended
sharply
circle
round
shaven
crown
The
hobbits
led
their
ponies
winding
round
and
round
until
they
reached
the
top
There
they
stood
and
gazed
about
them
The
air
was
gleaming
and
sunlit
but
hazy
and
they
could
not
see
any
great
distance
Near
hand
the
mist
was
now
almost
gone
though
here
and
there
lay
hollows
the
wood
and
the
south
them
out
deep
fold
cutting
right
across
the
Forest
the
fog
still
rose
like
steam
wisps
white
smoke
That
said
Merry
pointing
with
his
hand
that
the
line
the
Withywindle
comes
down
out
the
Downs
and
flows
south
west
through
the
midst
the
Forest
join
the
Brandywine
below
Haysend
don
want
that
way
The
Withywindle
valley
said
the
queerest
part
the
whole
wood
the
centre
from
which
all
the
queerness
comes
were
The
others
looked
the
direction
that
Merry
pointed
out
but
they
could
see
little
but
mists
over
the
damp
and
deep
cut
valley
and
beyond
the
southern
half
the
Forest
faded
from
view
The
sun
the
hill
top
was
now
getting
hot
must
have
been
about
eleven
clock
but
the
autumn
haze
still
prevented
them
from
seeing
much
other
directions
the
west
they
could
not
make
out
either
the
line
the
Hedge
the
valley
the
Brandywine
beyond
Northward
where
they
looked
most
hopefully
they
could
see
nothing
that
might
the
line
the
great
East
Road
for
which
they
were
making
They
were
island
sea
trees
and
the
horizon
was
veiled
the
south
eastern
side
the
ground
fell
very
steeply
the
slopes
the
hill
were
continued
far
down
under
the
trees
like
island
shores
that
really
are
the
sides
mountain
rising
out
deep
waters
They
sat
the
green
edge
and
looked
out
over
the
woods
below
them
while
they
ate
their
mid
day
meal
the
sun
rose
and
passed
noon
they
glimpsed
far
off
the
east
the
grey
green
lines
the
Downs
that
lay
beyond
the
Old
Forest
that
side
That
cheered
II4
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
them
greatly
for
was
good
see
sight
anything
beyond
the
wood
borders
though
they
did
not
mean
that
way
they
could
help
the
Barrow
downs
had
sinister
reputation
hobbit
legend
the
Forest
itself
length
they
made
their
minds
again
The
path
that
had
brought
them
the
hill
reappeared
the
northward
side
but
they
had
not
followed
far
before
they
became
aware
that
was
bending
steadily
the
right
Soon
began
descend
rapidly
and
they
guessed
that
must
actually
heading
towards
the
Withy
windle
valley
not
all
the
direction
they
wished
take
After
some
discussion
they
decided
leave
this
misleading
path
and
strike
north
ward
for
although
they
had
not
been
able
see
from
the
hill
top
the
Road
must
lie
that
way
and
could
not
many
miles
off
Also
northward
and
the
left
the
path
the
land
seemed
drier
and
more
open
climbing
slopes
where
the
trees
were
thinner
and
pines
and
firs
replaced
the
oaks
and
ashes
and
other
strange
and
nameless
trees
the
denser
wood
first
their
choice
seemed
good
they
got
along
fair
speed
though
whenever
they
got
glimpse
the
sun
open
glade
they
seemed
unaccountably
have
veered
eastwards
But
after
time
the
trees
began
close
again
just
where
they
had
appeared
from
distance
thinner
and
less
tangled
Then
deep
folds
the
ground
were
discovered
unexpectedly
like
the
ruts
great
giant
wheels
wide
moats
and
sunken
roads
long
disused
and
choked
with
brambles
These
lay
usually
right
across
their
line
march
and
could
only
crossed
scrambling
down
and
out
again
which
was
troublesome
and
difficult
with
their
ponies
Each
time
they
climbed
down
they
found
the
hollow
filled
with
thick
bushes
and
matted
undergrowth
which
somehow
would
not
yield
the
left
but
only
gave
way
when
they
turned
the
right
and
they
had
some
distance
along
the
bottom
before
they
could
find
way
the
further
bank
Each
time
they
clambered
out
the
trees
seemed
deeper
and
darker
and
always
the
left
and
upwards
was
most
difficult
find
way
and
they
were
forced
the
right
and
downwards
After
hour
two
they
had
lost
all
clear
sense
direction
though
they
knew
well
enough
that
they
had
long
ceased
north
ward
all
They
were
being
headed
off
and
were
simply
following
course
chosen
for
them
eastwards
and
southwards
into
the
heart
the
Forest
and
not
out
The
afternoon
was
wearing
away
when
they
scrambled
and
stumbled
into
fold
that
was
wider
and
deeper
than
any
they
had
THE
OLD
FOREST
II5
yet
met
was
steep
and
overhung
that
proved
impossible
climb
out
again
either
forwards
backwards
without
leaving
their
ponies
and
their
baggage
behind
All
they
could
was
follow
the
fold
downwards
The
ground
grew
soft
and
places
boggy
springs
appeared
the
banks
and
soon
they
found
themselves
fol
lowing
brook
that
trickled
and
babbled
through
weedy
bed
Then
the
ground
began
fall
rapidly
and
the
brook
growing
strong
and
noisy
flowed
and
leaped
swiftly
downhill
They
were
deep
dim
lit
gully
over
arched
trees
high
above
them
After
stumbling
along
for
some
way
along
the
stream
they
came
quite
suddenly
out
the
gloom
through
gate
they
saw
the
sunlight
before
them
Coming
the
opening
they
found
that
they
had
made
their
way
down
through
cleft
high
steep
bank
almost
cliff
its
feet
was
wide
space
grass
and
reeds
and
the
distance
could
glimpsed
another
bank
almost
steep
golden
afternoon
late
sunshine
lay
warm
and
drowsy
upon
the
hidden
land
between
the
midst
there
wound
lazily
dark
river
brown
water
bordered
with
ancient
willows
arched
over
with
willows
blocked
with
fallen
willows
and
flecked
with
thousands
faded
willow
leaves
The
air
was
thick
with
them
fluttering
yellow
from
the
branches
for
there
was
warm
and
gentle
breeze
blowing
softly
the
valley
and
the
reeds
were
rustling
and
the
willow
boughs
were
creaking
Well
now
have
least
some
notion
where
are
said
Merry
have
come
almost
the
opposite
direction
which
intended
This
the
River
Withywindle
will
and
explore
passed
out
into
the
sunshine
and
disappeared
into
the
long
grasses
After
while
reappeared
and
reported
that
there
was
fairly
solid
ground
between
the
cliff
foot
and
the
river
some
places
firm
turf
went
down
the
water
edge
What
more
said
there
seems
something
like
footpath
winding
along
this
side
the
river
turn
left
and
follow
shall
bound
come
out
the
east
side
the
Forest
eventually
dare
say
said
Pippin
That
the
track
goes
far
and
does
not
simply
lead
into
bog
and
leave
there
Who
made
the
track
you
suppose
and
why
sure
was
not
for
our
benefit
getting
very
suspicious
this
Forest
and
everything
and
begin
believe
all
the
stories
about
And
have
you
any
idea
how
far
eastward
should
have
said
Merry
haven
don
know
the
least
how
far
down
the
Withywindle
are
who
could
possibly
come
here
often
enough
make
path
along
But
there
other
way
out
that
can
see
think
There
being
nothing
else
for
they
filed
out
and
Merry
led
them
116
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
the
path
that
had
discovered
Everywhere
the
reeds
and
grasses
were
lush
and
tall
places
far
above
their
heads
but
once
found
the
path
was
easy
follow
turned
and
twisted
picking
out
the
sounder
ground
among
the
bogs
and
pools
Here
and
there
passed
over
other
rills
running
down
gullies
into
the
Withywindle
out
the
higher
forest
lands
and
these
points
there
were
tree
trunks
bundles
brushwood
laid
carefully
across
The
hobbits
began
feel
very
hot
There
were
armies
flies
all
kinds
buzzing
round
their
ears
and
the
afternoon
sun
was
burning
their
backs
last
they
came
suddenly
into
thin
shade
great
grey
branches
reached
across
the
path
Each
step
forward
became
more
reluctant
than
the
last
Sleepiness
seemed
creeping
out
the
ground
and
their
legs
and
falling
softly
out
the
air
upon
their
heads
and
eyes
Frodo
felt
his
chin
down
and
his
head
nod
Just
front
him
Pippin
fell
forward
his
knees
Frodo
halted
good
heard
Merry
saying
Can
another
step
without
rest
Must
have
nap
cool
under
the
willows
Less
flies
Frodo
did
not
like
the
sound
this
Come
cried
can
have
nap
yet
must
get
clear
the
Forest
first
But
the
others
were
too
far
gone
care
Beside
them
Sam
stood
yawning
and
blinking
stupidly
Suddenly
Frodo
himself
felt
sleep
overwhelming
him
His
head
swam
There
now
seemed
hardly
sound
the
air
The
flies
had
stopped
buzzing
Only
gentle
noise
the
edge
hearing
soft
fluttering
song
half
whispered
seemed
stir
the
boughs
above
lifted
his
heavy
eyes
and
saw
leaning
over
him
huge
willow
tree
old
and
hoary
Enormous
looked
its
sprawling
branches
going
like
reaching
arms
with
many
long
fingered
hands
its
knotted
and
twisted
trunk
gaping
wide
fissures
that
creaked
faintly
the
boughs
moved
The
leaves
fluttering
against
the
bright
sky
dazzled
him
and
toppled
over
lying
where
fell
upon
the
grass
Merry
and
Pippin
dragged
themselves
forward
and
lay
down
with
their
backs
the
willow
trunk
Behind
them
the
great
cracks
gaped
wide
receive
them
the
tree
swayed
and
creaked
They
looked
the
grey
and
yellow
leaves
moving
softly
against
the
light
and
singing
They
shut
their
eyes
and
then
seemed
that
they
could
almost
hear
words
cool
words
saying
something
about
water
and
sleep
They
gave
themselves
the
spell
and
fell
fast
asleep
the
foot
the
great
grey
willow
Frodo
lay
for
while
fighting
with
the
sleep
that
was
overpowering
him
then
with
effort
struggled
his
feet
again
felt
THE
OLD
FOREST
compelling
desire
for
cool
water
Wait
for
Sam
stammered
Must
bathe
feet
minute
Half
dream
wandered
forward
the
riverward
side
the
tree
where
great
winding
roots
grew
out
into
the
stream
like
gnarled
dragonets
straining
down
drink
straddled
one
these
and
paddled
his
hot
feet
the
cool
brown
water
and
there
too
suddenly
fell
asleep
with
his
back
against
the
tree
Sam
sat
down
and
scratched
his
head
and
yawned
like
cavern
was
worried
The
afternoon
was
getting
late
and
thought
this
sudden
sleepiness
uncanny
There
more
behind
this
than
sun
and
warm
air
muttered
himself
don
like
this
great
big
tree
don
trust
Hark
singing
about
sleep
now
This
won
all
pulled
himself
his
feet
and
staggered
off
see
what
had
become
the
ponies
found
that
two
had
wandered
good
way
along
the
path
and
had
just
caught
them
and
brought
them
back
towards
the
others
when
heard
two
noises
one
loud
and
the
other
soft
but
very
clear
One
was
the
splash
something
heavy
falling
into
the
water
the
other
was
noise
like
the
snick
lock
when
door
quietly
closes
fast
rushed
back
the
bank
Frodo
was
the
water
close
the
edge
and
great
tree
root
seemed
over
him
and
holding
him
down
but
was
not
struggling
Sam
gripped
him
the
jacket
and
dragged
him
from
under
the
root
and
then
with
difficulty
hauled
him
the
bank
Almost
once
woke
and
coughed
and
spluttered
you
know
Sam
said
length
the
beastly
tree
threw
felt
The
big
root
just
twisted
round
and
tipped
You
were
dreaming
expect
Frodo
said
Sam
You
shouldn
sit
such
place
you
feel
sleepy
What
about
the
others
Frodo
asked
wonder
what
sort
dreams
they
are
having
They
went
round
the
other
side
the
tree
and
then
Sam
understood
the
click
that
had
heard
Pippin
had
vanished
The
crack
which
had
laid
himself
had
closed
together
that
not
chink
could
seen
Merry
was
trapped
another
crack
had
closed
about
his
waist
his
legs
lay
outside
but
the
rest
him
was
inside
dark
opening
the
edges
which
gripped
like
pair
pincers
Frodo
and
Sam
beat
first
upon
the
tree
trunk
where
Pippin
had
lain
They
then
struggled
frantically
pull
open
the
jaws
the
crack
that
held
poor
Merry
was
quite
useless
What
foul
thing
happen
cried
Frodo
wildly
Why
did
ever
come
into
this
dreadful
Forest
wish
were
all
back

THE

RINGS
Crickhollow
kicked
the
tree
with
all
his
strength
heedless
his
own
feet
hardly
perceptible
shiver
ran
through
the
stem
and
into
the
branches
the
leaves
rustled
and
whispered
but
with
sound
now
faint
and
far
off
laughter

got

among
our

Frodo
asked
Sam
brought
little
hatchet
for
chopping

said
Frodo
That
wouldn

use
Wait

cried
Sam
struck
idea
suggested

Frodo
doubtfully
might

Sam
fiercely
don

them
Ill
have

gnaw
ran
the
ponies
and
before
long
came
back
with
two
tinder
boxes
and
hatchet
Quickly
they
gathered
dry
grass
and
leaves
and
bits
bark
and
made
pile
broken
twigs
and
chopped
sticks
These
they
heaped
against
the
trunk
the
far
side
the
tree
from
the
prisoners
soon
Sam
had
struck
spark
into
the
tinder
kindled
the
dry
grass
and
flurry
flame
and
smoke
went
The
twigs
crackled
Little
fingers
fire
licked
against
the
dry
scored
rind
the
ancient
tree
and
scorched
tremor
ran
through
the
whole
willow
The
leaves
seemed
hiss
above
their
heads
with
sound
pain
and
anger
loud
scream
came
from
Merry
and
from
far
inside
the
tree
they
heard
Pippin
give
muffled
yell
Put
out
Put
out
cried
Merry
squeeze
two
you
don
says
Who
What
shouted
Frodo
rushing
round
the
other
side
the
tree
Put
out
Put
out
begged
Merry
The
branches
the
willow
began
sway
violently
There
was
sound
wind
rising
and
spreading
outwards
the
branches
all
the
other
trees
round
about
though
they
had
dropped
stone
into
the
quiet
slumber
the
river
valley
and
set
ripples
anger
that
ran
out
over
the
whole
Forest
Sam
kicked
the
little
fire
and
stamped
out
the
sparks
But
Frodo
without
any
clear
idea
why
did
what
hoped
for
ran
along
the
path
crying
help
help
help
seemed
him
that
could
hardly
hear
the
sound
his
own
shrill
voice
was
blown
away
from
him
the
willow
wind
and
drowned
clamour
leaves
soon
the
words
left
his
mouth
felt
desperate
lost
and
witless
Suddenly
stopped
There
was
answer
thought
but
seemed
come
from
behind
him
away
down
the
path
further
THE
OLD

back
the
Forest
turned
round
and
listened
and
soon
there
could
doubt
someone
was
singing
song
deep
glad
voice
was
singing
carelessly
and
happily
but
was
singing
nonsense
Hey

Half
hopeful
and
half
afraid
some
new
danger
Frodo
and
Sam
now
both
stood
still
Suddenly
out
long
string
nonsense
words
they
seemed
the
voice
rose
loud
and
clear
and
burst
into
this
song
Hey
Come

Light

Hey

Can

Frodo
and
Sam
stood
enchanted
The
wind
puffed
out
The
leaves
hung
silently
again
stiff
branches
There
was
another
burst
song
and
then
suddenly
hopping
and
dancing
along
the
path
there
appeared
above
the
reeds
old
battered
hat
with
tall
crown
and
long
blue
feather
stuck
the
band
With
another
hop
and
bound
there
came
into
view
man
seemed
any

was
too
large
and
heavy
for

not
quite
tall
enough
for

the
Big

though
made
noise
enough
for

stumping
along
with
great
yellow
boots
his
thick
legs
and
charging
through
grass
and
rushes
like
cow
going
down
drink
had
blue
coat
and
long
brown
beard
his
eyes
were
blue
and
bright
and
his

was

creased
into
hundred
wrinkles

his

carried
large

Frodo
and
Sam
running
towards
him
with
their

stretched

cried
the

holding

and
they
stopped
short
they
had
been
struck
stiff
Now

where

going
puffing
like

What

Tom

Naught

Old
Man
Willow
Setting
down
his
lilies
carefully
the
grass
ran
the
tree
There
saw
Merry
feet
still
sticking
out
the
rest
had
already
been
drawn
further
inside
Tom
put
his
mouth
the
crack
and
began
singing
into
low
voice
They
could
not
catch
the
words
but
evidently
Merry
was
aroused
His
legs
began
kick
Tom
sprang
away
and
breaking
off
hanging
branch
smote
the
side
the
willow
with
You
let
them
out
again
Old
Man
Willow
said
What
you
thinking
You
should
not
waking
Eat

Dig

Drink

Bombadil
talking
then
seized
Merry
feet
and
drew
him
out
the
suddenly
widening
crack
There
was
tearing
creak
and
the
other
crack
split
open
and
out
Pippin
sprang
had
been
kicked
Then
with
loud
snap
both
cracks
closed
fast
again
shudder
ran
through
the
tree
from
root
tip
and
complete
silence
fell
Thank
you
said
the
hobbits
one
after
the
other
Tom
Bombadil
burst
out
laughing
Well
little
fellows
said
stooping
that
peered
into
their
faces
You
shall
come
home
with
The

all
laden
with

and

Goldberry
waiting
Time
enough
for

tions
around
the
supper
table
You
follow
after
quick
you
are
able
With
that
picked
his
lilies
and
then
with
beckoning
wave
his
hand
went
hopping
and
dancing
along
the
path
eastward
still
singing
loudly
and
nonsensically
Too
surprised
and
too
relieved
talk
the
hobbits
followed
after
him
fast
they
could
But
that
was
not
fast
enough
Tom
soon
disappeared
front
them
and
the
noise
his
singing
got
fainter
and
further
away
Suddenly
his
voice
came
floating
back
them
loud
halloo

Hey
now
merry

waiting
for
you
After
that
the
hobbits
heard
more
Almost
once
the
sun
seemed
sink
into
the
trees
behind
them
They
thought
the
slanting
light
evening
glittering
the
Brandywine
River
and
the
windows
Bucklebury
beginning
gleam
with
hundreds
lights
Great
shadows
fell
across
them
trunks
and
branches
trees
hung
dark
and
threatening
over
the
path
White
mists
began
rise
and
curl
the
surface
the
river
and
stray
about
the
roots
the
trees
upon
its
borders
Out
the
very
ground
their
feet
shadowy
steam
arose
and
mingled
with
the
swiftly
falling
dusk
became
difficult
follow
the
path
and
they
were
very
tired
Their
legs
seemed
leaden
Strange
furtive
noises
ran
among
the
bushes
and
reeds
either
side
them
and
they
looked
the
pale
sky
they
caught
sight
queer
gnarled
and
knobbly
faces
that
gloomed
dark
against
the
twilight
and
leered
down
them
from
the
high
bank
and
the
edges
the
wood
They
began
feel
that
all
this
country
was
unreal
and
that
they
were
stumbling
through
ominous
dream
that
led
awakening
Just
they
felt
their
feet
slowing
down
standstill
they
noticed
that
the
ground
was
gently
rising
The
water
began
murmur
the
darkness
they
caught
the
white
glimmer
foam
where
the
river
flowed
over
short
fall
Then
suddenly
the
trees
came
end
and
the
mists
were
left
behind
They
stepped
out
from
the
Forest
and
found
wide
sweep
grass
welling
before
them
The
river
now
small
and
swift
was
leaping
merrily
down
meet
them
glinting
here
and
there
the
light
the
stars
which
were
already
shining
the
sky
The
grass
under
their
feet
was
smooth
and
short
had
been
mown
shaven
The
eaves
the
Forest
behind
were
clipped
and
trim
hedge
The
path
was
now
plain
before
them
well
tended
and
bordered
with
stone
wound
the
top
grassy
knoll
now
grey
under
the
pale
starry
night
and
there
still
high
above
them
further
slope
they
saw
the
twinkling
lights
house
Down
again
the
path
went
and
then
again
long
smooth
hillside
turf
towards
the
light
Suddenly
wide
yellow
beam
flowed
out
brightly
from
door
that
was
opened
There
was
Tom
Bombadil
I22
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
house
before
them
down
under
hill
Behind
steep
shoulder
the
land
lay
grey
and
bare
and
beyond
that
the
dark
shapes
the
Barrow
downs
stalked
away
into
the
eastern
night
They
all
hurried
forward
hobbits
and
ponies
Already
half
their
weariness
and
all
their
fears
had
fallen
from
them
Hey
Come
merry

rolled
out
the
song
greet
them
Hey
Come
derry

Hop
along

Hobbits
Ponies
all
are

Now
let
the
fun
begin
Let
sing
together
Then
another
clear
voice
young
and
ancient
Spring
like
the
song
glad
water
flowing
down
into
the
night
from
bright
morning
the
hills
came
falling
like
silver
meet
them
Now
let
the
song
begin
Let
sing
together
sun

moon
and
mist
rain
and
cloudy
weather
Light
the
budding

Wind
the

Reeds
the

Old
Tom

And
with
that
song
the
hobbits
stood
upon
the
threshold
and
golden
light
was
all
about
them

THE
HOUSE
TOM
BOMBADIL
The
four
hobbits
stepped
over
the
wide
stone
threshold
and
stood
still
blinking
They
were
long
low
room
filled
with
the
light
lamps
swinging
from
the
beams
the
roof
and
the
table
dark
polished
wood
stood
many
candles
tall
and
yellow
burning
brightly
chair
the
far
side
the
room
facing
the
outer
door
sat
woman
Her
long
yellow
hair
rippled
down
her
shoulders
her
gown
was
green
green
young
reeds
shot
with
silver
like
beads
dew
and
her
belt
was
gold
shaped
like
chain
flag
lilies
set
with
the
pale
blue
eyes
forget
nots
About
her
feet
wide
vessels
green
and
brown
earthenware
white
water
lilies
were
floating
that
she
seemed
enthroned
the
midst
pool
Enter
good
guests
she
said
and
she
spoke
they
knew
that
was
her
clear
voice
they
had
heard
singing
They
came
few
timid
steps
further
into
the
room
and
began
bow
low
feeling
strangely
surprised
and
awkward
like
folk
that
knocking
cottage
door
beg
for
drink
water
have
been
answered
fair
young
elf
queen
clad
living
flowers
But
before
they
could
say
anything
she
sprang
lightly
and
over
the
lily
bowls
and
ran
laughing
towards
them
and
she
ran
her
gown
rustled
softly
like
the
wind
the
flowering
borders
river
Come
dear
folk
she
said
taking
Frodo
the
hand
Laugh
and
merry
Goldberry
daughter
the
River
Then
lightly
she
passed
them
and
closing
the
door
she
turned
her
back
with
her
white
arms
spread
out
across
Let
shut
out
the
night
she
said
For
you
are
still
afraid
perhaps
mist
and
tree
shadows
and
deep
water
and
untame
things
Fear
nothing
For
tonight
you
are
under
the
roof
Tom
Bombadil
The
hobbits
looked
her
wonder
and
she
looked
each
them
and
smiled
Fair
lady
Goldberry
said
Frodo
last
feeling
his
heart
moved
with
joy
that
did
not
understand
stood
had
times
stood
enchanted
fair
elven
voices
but
the
spell
that
was
now
laid
upon
him
was
different
less
keen
and
lofty
was
the
delight
but
deeper
and
nearer
mortal
heart
marvellous
and
yet
not
strange
Fair
lady
Goldberry
said
again
Now
the
joy
that
was
hidden
the
songs
heard
made
plain

Suddenly
stopped
and
stammered
overcome
with
surprise
hear
himself
saying
such
things
But
Goldberry
laughed
Welcome
she
said
had
not
heard
that

the

were
sweet
tongued
But
see
that
you
are

tells
This
merry
meeting
Sit
now
and

Master

not
long
tending
your
tired

The
hobbits
sat
down
gladly
low
rush
seated
chairs
while
Gold

busied
herself
about
the
table
and
their
eyes
followed
her
for
the
slender
grace
her
movement
filled
them
with
quiet
delight
From
somewhere
behind
the
house
came
the
sound
singing
Every
now
and
again
they
caught
among
many

Frodo
again
after
while
Tell

not
seem
foolish
who
Tom
Bombadil
said
Goldberry
staying
her
swift
movements
and
smiling
Frodo
looked
her
questioningly
you

him
she
said
answer

Then
all
this

indeed
she
answered
and
her

faded
That
would
indeed

she
added
low
voice
herself
The

all

his
thick
brown
hair
was
crowned
with
autumn
leaves
laughed
and
going
Goldberry
took
her
hand
Here
pretty
lady
said
bowing
the
hobbits
Here
Goldberry
clothed
all
silver
green
with
flowers
her
girdle
the
table
laden
see
yellow
cream
and
honeycomb
and
white
bread
and
butter
milk
cheese
and
green
herbs
and
ripe
berries
gathered
that
enough
for
the
supper
ready
THE
HOUSE
TOM
BOMBADIL
I25
said
Goldberry
but
the
guests
perhaps
are
not
Tom
clapped
his
hands
and
cried
Tom
Tom
your
guests
are
tired
and
you
had
near
forgotten
Come
now
merry
friends
and
Tom
will
refresh
you
You
shall
clean
grimy
hands
and
wash
your
weary
faces
cast
off
your
muddy
cloaks
and
comb
out
your
tangles
opened
the
door
and
they
followed
him
down
short
passage
and
round
sharp
turn
They
came
low
room
with
sloping
roof
penthouse
seemed
built
the
north
end
the
house
Its
walls
were
clean
stone
but
they
were
mostly
covered
with
green
hanging
mats
and
yellow
curtains
The
floor
was
flagged
and
strewn
with
fresh
green
rushes
There
were
four
deep
mattresses
each
piled
with
white
blankets
laid
the
floor
along
one
side
Against
the
opposite
wall
was
long
bench
laden
with
wide
earthenware
basins
and
beside
stood
brown
ewers
filled
with
water
some
cold
some
steaming
hot
There
were
soft
green
slippers
set
ready
beside
each
bed
Before
long
washed
and
refreshed
the
hobbits
were
seated
the
table
two
each
side
while
either
end
sat
Goldberry
and
the
Master
was
long
and
merry
meal
Though
the
hobbits
ate
only
famished
hobbits
can
eat
there
was
lack
The
drink
their
drinking
bowls
seemed
clear
cold
water
yet
went
their
hearts
like
wine
and
set
free
their
voices
The
guests
became
suddenly
aware
that
they
were
singing
merrily
was
easier
and
more
natural
than
talking
last
Tom
and
Goldberry
rose
and
cleared
the
table
swiftly
The
guests
were
commanded
sit
quiet
and
were
set
chairs
each
with
footstool
his
tired
feet
There
was
fire
the
wide
hearth
before
them
and
was
burning
with
sweet
smell
were
built
apple
wood
When
everything
was
set
order
all
the
lights
the
room
were
put
out
except
one
lamp
and
pair
candles
each
end
the
chimney
shelf
Then
Goldberry
came
and
stood
before
them
holding
candle
and
she
wished
them
each
good
night
and
deep
sleep
Have
peace
now
she
said
until
the
morning
Heed
nightly
noises
For
nothing
passes
door
and
window
here
save
moonlight
and
starlight
and
the
wind
off
the
hill
top
Good
night
She
passed
out
the
room
with
glimmer
and
rustle
The
sound
her
footsteps
was
like
stream
falling
gently
away
downhill
over
cool
stones
the
quiet
night
Tom
sat
while
beside
them
silence
while
each
them
tried
muster
the
courage
ask
one
the
many
questions
had
meant
ask
supper
Sleep
gathered
their
eyelids
last
Frodo
spoke
126
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Did
you
hear
calling
Master
was
just
chance
that
brought
you
that
moment
Tom
stirred
like
man
shaken
out
pleasant
dream
what
said
Did
hear
you
calling
Nay
did
not
hear
was
busy
singing
Just
chance
brought
then
chance
you
call
was
plan
mine
though
was
waiting
for
you
heard
news
you
and
learned
that
you
were
wandering
guessed
you
come
ere
long
down
the
water
all
paths

that
way
down
Withy
windle
Old
grey
Willow

mighty
singer
and
hard
for
little
folk
escape
his
cunning
mazes
But
Tom
had
errand
there
that
dared
not
hinder
Tom
nodded
sleep
was
taking
him
again
but
went
soft
singing
voice
had
errand
there
gathering
water
lilies
green
leaves
and
lilies

pretty
lady
the
last

pretty
feet
till

Each

her
wide
pool
deep
and
clear
far
down
Withywindle
there
they
open
first
spring
and
there
they
linger
latest
that
pool
long
ago
found
the
River
daughter
fair
young
Goldberry
sitting
the
rushes
Sweet
was
her
singing
then
and
her
heart
was
beating
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
them
with
sudden
glint
blue
And
that
proved
well
for
you
for
now
shall
longer
down
deep
again
along
the
forest

not
till
the
merry
spring
when
the
River
daughter
dances
down
the
withy
path
bathe
the
water
fell
silent
again
but
Frodo
could
not
help
asking
one
more
question
the
one
most
desired
have
answered
Tell
Master
said
about
the
Willow
man
What
have
never
heard
him
before
don
said
Merry
and
Pippin
together
sitting
suddenly
upright
Not
now
Not
until
the
morning
That
right
said
the
old
man
Now
the
time
for
resting
Some
things
are
ill
hear
when
the
world
shadow
Sleep
till
the
morning
light
rest
the
pillow
Heed
nightly
noise
Fear
grey
willow
And
with
that
took
down
the
lamp
and
blew
out
and
grasping
candle
either
hand
led
them
out
the
room
THE
HOUSE
TOM
BOMBADIL
I27
Their
mattresses
and
pillows
were
soft
down
and
the
blankets
were
white
wool
They
had
hardly
laid
themselves
the
deep
beds
and
drawn
the
light
covers
over
them
before
they
were
asleep
the
dead
night
Frodo
lay
dream
without
light
Then
saw
the
young
moon
rising
under
its
thin
light
there
loomed
before
him
black
wall
rock
pierced
dark
arch
like
great
gate
seemed
Frodo
that
was
lifted
and
passing
over
saw
that
the
rock
wall
was
circle
hills
and
that
within
was
plain
and
the
midst
the
plain
stood
pinnacle
stone
like
vast
tower
but
not
made
hands
its
top
stood
the
figure
man
The
moon
rose
seemed
hang
for
moment
above
his
head
and
glistened
his
white
hair
the
wind
stirred
from
the
dark
plain
below
came
the
crying
fell
voices
and
the
howling
many
wolves
Suddenly
shadow
like
the
shape
great
wings
passed
across
the
moon
The
figure
lifted
his
arms
and
light
flashed
from
the
staff
that
wielded
mighty
eagle
swept
down
and
bore
him
away
The
voices
wailed
and
the
wolves
yammered
There
was
noise
like
strong
wind
blowing
and
was
borne
the
sound
hoofs
galloping
galloping
galloping
from
the
East
Black
Riders
thought
Frodo
wakened
with
the
sound
the
hoofs
still
echo
ing
his
mind
wondered
would
ever
again
have
the
courage
leave
the
safety
these
stone
walls
lay
motionless
still
listen
ing
but
all
was
now
silent
and
last
turned
and
fell
asleep
again
wandered
into
some
other
unremembered
dream
his
side
Pippin
lay
dreaming
pleasantly
but
change
came
over
his
dreams
and
turned
and
groaned
Suddenly
woke
thought
had
waked
and
yet
still
heard
the
darkness
the
sound
that
had
disturbed
his
dream
tip
tap
squeak
the
noise
was
like
branches
fretting
the
wind
twig
fingers
scraping
wall
and
window
creak
creak
creak
wondered
there
were
willow
trees
close
the
house
and
then
suddenly
had
dreadful
feeling
that
was
not
ordinary
house
all
but
inside
the
willow
and
listening
that
horrible
dry
creaking
voice
laughing
him
again
sat
and
felt
the
soft
pillows
yield
his
hands
and
lay
down
again
relieved
seemed
hear
the
echo
words
his
ears
Fear
nothing
Have
peace
until
the
morning
Heed
nightly
noises
Then
went
sleep
again
was
the
sound
water
that
Merry
heard
falling
into
his
quiet
sleep
water
streaming
down
gently
and
then
spreading
spreading
irresistibly
all
round
the
house
into
dark
shoreless
pool
gurgled
under
the
walls
and
was
rising
slowly
but
surely
shall
drowned
thought
will
find
its
way
and
then
shall
drown
felt
that
was
lying
soft
slimy
bog
and
springing
set
his
foot
128
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
the
corner
cold
hard
flagstone
Then
remembered
where
was
and
lay
down
again
seemed
hear
remember
hearing
Nothing
passes
doors
windows
save
moonlight
and
starlight
and
the
wind
off
the
hill
top
little
breath
sweet
air
moved
the
curtain
breathed
deep
and
fell
asleep
again
far
could
remember
Sam
slept
through
the
night
deep
content
logs
are
contented
They
woke
all
four
once
the
morning
light
Tom
was
moving
about
the
room
whistling
like
starling
When
heard
them
stir
clapped
his
hands
and
cried
Hey
Come
merry
dol
derry
dol
hearties
drew
back
the
yellow
curtains
and
the
hobbits
saw
that
these
had
covered
the
windows
either
end
the
room
one
looking
east
and
the
other
looking
west
They
leapt
refreshed
Frodo
ran
the
eastern
window
and
found
himself
looking
into
kitchen
garden
grey
with
dew
had
half
expected
see
turf
right
the
walls
turf
all
pocked
with
hoof
prints
Actually
his
view
was
screened
tall
line
beans
poles
but
above
and
far
beyond
them
the
grey
top
the
hill
loomed
against
the
sunrise
was
pale
morning
the
East
behind
long
clouds
like
lines
soiled
wool
stained
red
the
edges
lay
glimmering
deeps
yellow
The
sky
spoke
rain
come
but
the
light
was
broadening
quickly
and
the
red
flowers
the
beans
began
glow
against
the
wet
green
leaves
Pippin
looked
out
the
western
window
down
into
pool
mist
The
Forest
was
hidden
under
fog
was
like
looking
down
sloping
cloud
roof
from
above
There
was
fold
channel
where
the
mist
was
broken
into
many
plumes
and
billows
the
valley
the
Withywindle
The
stream
ran
down
the
hill
the
left
and
vanished
into
the
white
shadows
Near
hand
was
flower
garden
and
clipped
hedge
silver
netted
and
beyond
that
grey
shaven
grass
pale
with
dew
drops
There
was
willow
tree
seen
Good
morning
merry
friends
cried
Tom
opening
the
eastern
window
wide
cool
air
flowed
had
rainy
smell
Sun
won
show
her
face
much
today
thinking
have
been
walking
wide
leaping
the
hill
tops
since
the
grey
dawn
began
nosing
wind
and
weather
wet
grass
underfoot
wet
sky
above
wakened
Goldberry
singing
under
window
but
naught
wakes
hobbit
folk
the
early
morning
the
night
little
folk
wake
the
darkness
and
sleep
after
light
has
come
Ring

Wake
now
merry
friends
Forget
the
nightly
noises
Ring

del
hearties
you
come
soon
you
find
breakfast
the
table
you

and
rain

Needless
say
not
that
Tom
threat
sounded
very
serious
THE
HOUSE
TOM
BOMBADIL
129
the
hobbits
came
soon
and
left
the
table
late
and
only
when
was
beginning
look
rather
empty
Neither
Tom
nor
Goldberry
were
there
Tom
could
heard
about
the
house
clattering
the
kitchen
and
and
down
the
stairs
and
singing
here
and
there
outside
The
room
looked
westward
over
the
mist
clouded
valley
and
the
window
was
open
Water
dripped
down
from
the
thatched
eaves
above
Before
they
had
finished
breakfast
the
clouds
had
joined
into
unbroken
roof
and
straight
grey
rain
came
softly
and
steadily
down
Behind
its
deep
curtain
the
Forest
was
completely
veiled
they
looked
out
the
window
there
came
falling
gently
was
flowing
down
the
rain
out
the
sky
the
clear
voice
Gold
berry
singing
above
them
They
could
hear
few
words
but
seemed
plain
them
that
the
song
was
rain
song
sweet
showers
dry
hills
that
told
the
tale
river
from
the
spring
the
highlands
the
Sea
far
below
The
hobbits
listened
with
delight
and
Frodo
was
glad
his
heart
and
blessed
the
kindly
weather
because
delayed
them
from
departing
The
thought
going
had
been
heavy
upon
him
from
the
moment
awoke
but
guessed
now
that
they
would
not
further
that
day
The
upper
wind
settled
the
West
and
deeper
and
wetter
clouds
rolled
spill
their
laden
rain
the
bare
heads
the
Downs
Nothing
could
seen
all
round
the
house
but
falling
water
Frodo
stood
near
the
open
door
and
watched
the
white
chalky
path
turn
into
little
river
milk
and
bubbling
away
down
into
the
valley
Tom
Bombadil
came
trotting
round
the
corner
the
house
waving
his
arms
was
warding
off
the
rain
and
indeed
when
sprang
over
the
threshold
seemed
quite
dry
except
for
his
boots
These
took
off
and
put
the
chimney
corner
Then
sat
the
largest
chair
and
called
the
hobbits
gather
round
him
This
Goldberry
washing
day
said
and
her
autumn
cleaning
Too
wet
for
hobbit
folk
let
them
rest
while
they
are
able
good
day
for
long
tales
for
questions
and
for
answers
Tom
will
start
the
talking
then
told
them
many
remarkable
stories
sometimes
half
speaking
himself
sometimes
looking
them
suddenly
with
bright
blue
eye
under
his
deep
brows
Often
his
voice
would
turn
song
and
would
get
out
his
chair
and
dance
about
told
them
tales
bees
and
flowers
the
ways
trees
and
the
strange
creatures
the
Forest
about
the
evil
things
and
good
things
things
friendly
and
things
unfriendly
cruel
things
and
kind
things
and
secrets
hidden
under
brambles
they
listened
they
began
understand
the
lives
the
Forest
apart
from
themselves
indeed
feel
themselves
the
strangers
130
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
where
all
other
things
were
home
Moving
constantly
and
out
his
talk
was
Old
Man
Willow
and
Frodo
learned
now
enough
content
him
indeed
more
than
enough
for
was
not
comfortable
lore
Tom
words
laid
bare
the
hearts
trees
and
their
thoughts
which
were
often
dark
and
strange
and
filled
with
hatred
things
that
free
upon
the
earth
gnawing
biting
breaking
hacking
burn
ing
destroyers
and
usurpers
was
not
called
the
Old
Forest
without
reason
for
was
indeed
ancient
survivor
vast
forgotten
woods
and
there
lived
yet
ageing
quicker
than
the
hills
the
fathers
the
fathers
trees
remembering
times
when
they
were
lords
The
countless
years
had
filled
them
with
pride
and
rooted
wisdom
and
with
malice
But
none
were
more
dangerous
than
the
Great
Willow
his
heart
was
rotten
but
his
strength
was
green
and
was
cunning
and
master
winds
and
his
song
and
thought
ran
through
the
woods
both
sides
the
river
His
grey
thirsty
spirit
drew
power
out
the
earth
and
spread
like
fine
root
threads
the
ground
and
invisible
twig
fingers
the
air
till
had
under
its
dominion
nearly
all
the
trees
the
Forest
from
the
Hedge
the
Downs
Suddenly
Tom
talk
left
the
woods
and
went
leaping
the
young
stream
over
bubbling
waterfalls
over
pebbles
and
worn
rocks
and
among
small
flowers
close
grass
and
wet
crannies
wandering
last
the
Downs
They
heard
the
Great
Barrows
and
the
green
mounds
and
the
stone
rings
upon
the
hills
and
the
hollows
among
the
hills
Sheep
were
bleating
flocks
Green
walls
and
white
walls
rose
There
were
fortresses
the
heights
Kings
little
king
doms
fought
together
and
the
young
Sun
shone
like
fire
the
red
metal
their
new
and
greedy
swords
There
was
victory
and
defeat
and
towers
fell
fortresses
were
burned
and
flames
went
into
the
sky
Gold
was
piled
the
biers
dead
kings
and
queens
and
mounds
covered
them
and
the
stone
doors
were
shut
and
the
grass
grew
over
all
Sheep
walked
for
while
biting
the
grass
but
soon
the
hills
were
empty
again
shadow
came
out
dark
places
far
away
and
the
bones
were
stirred
the
mounds
Barrow
wights
walked
the
hollow
places
with
clink
rings
cold
fingers
and
gold
chains
the
wind
Stone
rings
grinned
out
the
ground
like
broken
teeth
the
moonlight
The
hobbits
shuddered
Even
the
Shire
the
rumour
the
Barrow
wights
the
Barrow
downs
beyond
the
Forest
had
been
heard
But
was
not
tale
that
any
hobbit
liked
listen
even
comfortable
fireside
far
away
These
four
now
suddenly
membered
what
the
joy
this
house
had
driven
from
their
minds
the
house
Tom
Bombadil
nestled
under
the
very
shoulder
those
dreaded
hills
They
lost
the
thread
his
tale
and
shifted
uneasily
looking
aside
one
another
THE
HOUSE
TOM
BOMBADIL
I3I
When
they
caught
his
words
again
they
found
that
had
now
wandered
into
strange
regions
beyond
their
memory
and
beyond
their
waking
thought
into
times
when
the
world
was
wider
and
the
seas
flowed
straight
the
western
Shore
and
still
and
back
Tom
went
singing
out
into
ancient
starlight
when
only
the
Elf
sires
were
awake
Then
suddenly
stopped
and
they
saw
that
nodded
was
falling
asleep
The
hobbits
sat
still
before
him
enchanted
and
seemed
under
the
spell
his
words
the
wind
had
gone
and
the
clouds
had
dried
and
the
day
had
been
withdrawn
and
darkness
had
come
from
East
and
West
and
all
the
sky
was
filled
with
the
light
white
stars
Whether
the
morning
and
evening
one
day
many
days
had
passed
Frodo
could
not
tell
did
not
feel
either
hungry
tired
only
filled
with
wonder
The
stars
shone
through
the
window
and
the
silence
the
heavens
seemed
round
him
spoke
last
out
his
wonder
and
sudden
fear
that
silence
Who
are
you
Master
asked
what
said
Tom
sitting
and
his
eyes
glinting
the
gloom
Don
you
know
name
yet
That
the
only
answer
Tell
who
are
you
alone
yourself
and
nameless
But
you
are
young
and
Tam
old
Eldest
that
what
Mark

friends
Tom
was
here
before
the
river
and
the
trees
Tom
remembers
the
first
raindrop
and
the
first
acorn
made
paths
before
the
Big
People
and
saw
the
little
People
arriving
was
here
before
the
Kings
and
the
graves
and
the
Barrow
wights
When
the
Elves
passed
westward
Tom
was
here
already
before
the
seas
were
bent
knew
the
dark
under
the
stars
when
was
fearless
before
the
Dark
Lord
came
from
Outside
shadow
seemed
pass
the
window
and
the
hobbits
glanced
hastily
through
the
panes
When
they
turned
again
Goldberry
stood
the
door
behind
framed
light
She
held
candle
shielding
its
flame
from
the
draught
with
her
hand
and
the
light
flowed
through
like
sunlight
through
white
shell
The
rain
has
ended
she
said
and
new
waters
are
running
down
hill
under
the
stars
Let
now
laugh
and
glad
And
let
have
food
and
drink
cried
Tom
Long
tales
are
thirsty
And
long
listening
hungry
work
morning
noon
and
evening
With
that
jumped
out
his
chair
and
with
bound
took
candle
from
the
chimney
shelf
and
lit
the
flame
that
Goldberry
held
then
danced
about
the
table
Suddenly
hopped
through
the
door
and
disappeared
Quickly
returned
bearing
large
and
laden
tray
Then
Tom
and
Goldberry
set
the
table
and
the
hobbits
sat
half
wonder
and
half
laughter
fair
was
the
grace
Goldberry
and
merry
and

odd
the

Tom
Yet
some
fashion
they
seemed
weave
single
dance
neither
hindering
the
other
and
out
the
room
and
round
about
the
table
and
with
great
speed
food
and
vessels
and
lights
were
set
order
The
boards
blazed
with
candles
white
and
yellow
Tom
bowed
his
guests
Supper
ready
said
Goldberry
and
now
the
hobbits
saw
that
she
was
clothed
all
silver
with
white
girdle
and
her
shoes
were
like
fishes
mail
But
Tom
was
all
clean

may
have
missed
one

many
but
when
the
food
was
before

since

had

They
did
not

for

business
But
after
time
their
hearts
and
spirits
rose
high
again
and
their
voices
rang
out
mirth
and
laughter
After
they
had
eaten
Goldberry
sang
many
songs
for
them
songs
that
began
merrily
the
hills
and
fell
softly
down
into
silence
and
the
silences
they
saw
their
minds
pools
and
waters
wider
than
any
they
had
known
and
looking
into
them
they
saw
the
sky
below
them
and
the
stars
like
jewels
the
depths
Then
once
more
she
wished
them
each
good
night
and
left
them
the
fireside
But
Tom
now
seemed
wide
awake
and
plied
them
with
questions
appeared
already
know
much
about
them
and
all
their
families
and
indeed
know
much
all
the
history
and
doings
the
Shire
down
from
days
hardly
remembered
among
the
hobbits
themselves
longer
surprised
them
but
made
secret
that
owed
his
recent
knowledge
largely
Farmer
Maggot
whom
seemed
regard
person
more
importance
than
they
had
imagined
There
earth
under
his
old
feet
and
clay
his
fingers
wisdom
his
bones
and
both
his
eyes
are
open
said
Tom
was
also
clear
that
Tom
had
dealings
with
the
Elves
and
seemed
that
some
fashion
news
had
reached
him
from
Gildor
concerning
the
flight
Frodo
Indeed
much
did
Tom
know
and
cunning
was
his
question
ing
that
Frodo
found
himself
telling
him
more
about
Bilbo
and
his
own
hopes
and
fears
than
had
told
before
even
Gandalf
Tom
wagged
his
head
and
down
and
there
was
glint
his
eyes
when
heard
the
Riders
Show
the
precious
Ring
said
suddenly
the
midst
the
story
and
Frodo
his
own
astonishment
drew
out
the
chain
from
his
pocket
and
unfastening
the
Ring
handed
once
Tom
seemed
grow
larger
lay
for
moment
his
big
brown
skinned
hand
Then
suddenly
put
his
eye
and
laughed

second
the
hobbits
had
vision
both
comical
and
alarming
his
bright
blue
eye
gleaming
through
circle
gold
Then
Tom
put
the
Ring
round
the
end
his
little
finger
and
held
the
candlelight
For
moment
the
hobbits
noticed
nothing
strange
about
this
Then
they
gasped
There
was
sign
Tom
disappearing
Tom
laughed
again
and
then
spun
the
Ring
the
air
and
vanished
with
flash
Frodo
gave
cry
and
Tom
leaned
forward
and
handed
back
him
with
smile
Frodo
looked
closely
and
rather
suspiciously
like
one
who
has
lent
trinket
juggler
was
the
same
Ring
looked
the
same
and
weighed
the
same
for
that
Ring
had
always
seemed
Frodo
weigh
strangely
heavy
the
hand
But
something
prompted
him
make
sure
was
perhaps
trifle
annoyed
with
Tom
for
seeming
make
light
what
even
Gandalf
thought
perilously
important
waited
for
opportunity
when
the
talk
was
going
again
and
Tom
was
telling
absurd
story
about
badgers
and
their
queer
ways
then
slipped
the
Ring
Merry
turned
towards
him
say
something
and
gave
start
and
checked
exclamation
Frodo
was
delighted
way
was
his
own
ring
all
right
for
Merry
was
staring
blankly
his
chair
and
obviously
could
not
see
him
got
and
crept
quietly
away
from
the
fireside
towards
the
outer
door
Hey
there
cried
Tom
glancing
towards
him
with
most
seeing
look
his
shining
eyes
Hey
Come

Frodo
laughed
trying
feel
pleased
and
taking
off
the
Ring
came
and
sat
down
again
Tom
now
told
them
that
reckoned
the
Sun

shine

and

But
they

Chapter
FOG
THE
BARROW
DOWNS
That
night
they
heard
noises
But
either
his
dreams
out
them
could
not
tell
which
Frodo
heard
sweet
singing
running
his
mind
song
that
seemed
come
like
pale
light
behind
grey
rain
curtain
and
growing
stronger
turn
the
veil
all
glass
and
silver
until
last
was
rolled
back
and
far
green
country
opened
before
him
under
swift
sunrise
The
vision
melted
into
waking
and
there
was
Tom
whistling
like
tree
full
birds
and
the
sun
was
already
slanting
down
the
hill
and
through
the
open
window
Outside
everything
was
green
and
pale
gold
After
breakfast
which
they
again
ate
alone
they
made
ready
say
farewell
nearly
heavy
heart
was
possible
such
morn
ing
cool
bright
and
clean
under
washed
autumn
sky
thin
blue
The
air
came
fresh
from
the
North
west
Their
quiet
ponies
were
almost
frisky
sniffing
and
moving
restlessly
Tom
came
out
the
house
and
waved
his
hat
and
danced
upon
the
doorstep
bidding
the
hobbits
get
and
off
and
with
good
speed
They
rode
off
along
path
that
wound
away
from
behind
the
house
and
went
slanting
towards
the
north
end
the
hill
brow
under
which
sheltered
They
had
just
dismounted
lead
their
ponies
the
last
steep
slope
when
suddenly
Frodo
stopped
Goldberry
cried
fair
lady
clad
all
silver
green
have
never
said
farewell
her
nor
seen
her
since
the
evening
was
distressed
that
turned
back
but
that
moment
clear
call
came
rippling
down
There
the
hill
brow
she
stood
beckoning
them
her
hair
was
flying
loose
and
caught
the
sun
shone
and
shimmered
light
like
the
glint
water
dewy
grass
flashed
from
under
her
feet
she
danced
They
hastened
the
last
slope
and
stood
breathless
beside
her
They
bowed
but
with
wave
her
arm
she
bade
them
look
round
and
they
looked
out
from
the
hill
top
over
lands
under
the
morning
was
now
clear
and
far
seen
had
been
veiled
and
misty
when
they
stood
upon
the
knoll
the
Forest
which
could
now
seen
rising
pale
and
green
out
the
dark
trees
the
West
that
direction
the
land
rose
wooded
ridges
green
yellow
russet
under
the
sun
beyond
which
lay
hidden
the
valley
the
Brandywine
the
South
over
the
line
the
Withywindle
there
was
distant
glint
like
pale
glass
where
the
Brandywine
River
made
great
loop

the

and
flowed
away
out
the

the

Northward
beyond
the
dwindling
downs
the
land
ran
away
flats
and
swellings
grey
and
green
and
pale

colours
until
faded
into
featureless
and
shadowy
distance
Eastward
the
Barrow
downs
rose
ridge
behind

into
the
morning
and
vanished
out
eye
sight
into
guess
was
more
than
guess
blue
and
remote
white
glimmer
blending
with
the
hem
the
sky
but
spoke
them
out
memory
and
old
tales
the
high
and
distant
mountains
They
took
deep
draught
the
air
and
felt
that
skip
and
few
stout
strides
would
bear
them
wherever
they
wished
seemed
fainthearted
jogging
aside
over
the
crumpled
skirts
the
downs
towards
the
Road
when
they
should
leaping
lusty
Tom
over
the
stepping
stones
the
hills
straight
towards
the
Mountains
Goldberry
spoke
them
and
recalled
their
eyes
and
thoughts
Speed
now
fair
guests
she
said
And
hold
your
purpose
North
with
the
wind
the
left
eye
and
blessing
your
footsteps
Make
haste
while
the
Sun
shines
And
Frodo
she
said
Farewell
Elf
friend
was
merry
meeting
But
Frodo
found
words
answer
bowed
low
and
mounted
his
pony
and
followed
his
friends
jogged
slowly
down
the
gentle
slope
behind
the
hill
Tom
Bombadil
house
and
the
valley
and
the
Forest
were
lost
view
The
air
grew
warmer
between
the
green
walls
hillside
and
hillside
and
the
scent
turf
rose
strong
and
sweet
they
breathed
Turning
back
when
they
reached
the
bottom
the
green
hollow
they
saw
Goldberry
now
small
and
slender
like
sunlit
flower
against
the
sky
she
was
standing
still
watching
them
and
her
hands
were
stretched
out
towards
them
they
looked
she
gave
clear
call
and
lifting
her
hand
she
turned
and
vanished
behind
the
hill
Their
way
wound
along
the
floor
the
hollow
and
round
the
green
feet
steep
hill
into
another
deeper
and
broader
valley
and
then
over
the
shoulders
further
hills
and
down
their
long
limbs
and
their
smooth
sides
again
new
hill
tops
and
down
into
new
valleys
There
was
tree
nor
any
visible
water
was
country
grass
and
short
springy
turf
silent
except
for
the
whisper
the
air
over
the
edges
the
land
and
high
lonely
cries
strange
birds
they
journeyed
the
sun
mounted
and
grew
hot
Each
time
they
climbed
ridge
the
breeze
seemed
have
grown
less
When
they
caught
glimpse
the
country
westward
the
distant
Forest
seemed
smoking
the
fallen
rain
was
steaming
again
from
leaf
and
root
and
mould
shadow
now
lay
round
the
edge
sight
dark
haze
above
which
the
upper
sky
was
like

hot
and
heavy
FOG
THE
BARROW
DOWNS
137
About
mid
day
they
came
hill
whose
top
was
wide
and
flat
tened
like
shallow
saucer
with
green
mounded
rim
Inside
there
was
air
stirring
and
the
sky
seemed
near
their
heads
They
rode
across
and
looked
northwards
Then
their
hearts
rose
for
seemed
plain
that
they
had
come
further
already
than
they
had
expected
Certainly
the
distances
had
now
all
become
hazy
and
deceptive
but
there
could
doubt
that
the
Downs
were
coming
end
long
valley
lay
below
them
winding
away
northwards
until
came
opening
between
two
steep
shoulders
Beyond
there
seemed
more
hills
Due
north
they
faintly
glimpsed
long
dark
line
That
line
trees
said
Merry
and
that
must
mark
the
Road
All
along
for
many
leagues
east
the
Bridge
there
are
trees
growing
Some
say
they
were
planted
the
old
days
Splendid
said
Frodo
make
good
going
this
afternoon
have
done
this
morning
shall
have
left
the
Downs
before
the
Sun
sets
and
jogging
search
camping
place
But
even
spoke
turned
his
glance
eastwards
and
saw
that
that
side
the
hills
were
higher
and
looked
down
upon
them
and
all
those
hills
were
crowned
with
green
mounds
and
some
were
standing
stones
pointing
upwards
like
jagged
teeth
out
green
gums
That
view
was
somehow
disquieting
they
turned
from
the
sight
and
went
down
into
the
hollow
circle
the
midst
there
stood
single
stone
standing
tall
under
the
sun
above
and
this
hour
casting
shadow
was
shapeless
and
yet
significant
like
land
mark
guarding
finger
more
like
warning
But
they
were
now
hungry
and
the
sun
was
still
the
fearless
noon
they
set
their
backs
against
the
east
side
the
stone
was
cool
the
sun
had
had
power
warm
but
that
time
this
seemed
pleasant
There
they
took
food
and
drink
and
made
good
noon
meal
under
the
open
sky
anyone
could
wish
for
the
food
came
from
down
under
Hill
Tom
had
provided
them
with
plenty
for
the
comfort
the
day
Their
ponies
unburdened
strayed
upon
the
grass
Riding
over
the
hills
and
eating
their
fill
the
warm
sun
and
the
scent
turf
lying
little
too
long
stretching
out
their
legs
and
looking
the
sky
above
their
noses
these
things
are
perhaps
enough
explain
what
happened
However
that
may
they
woke
suddenly
and
uncomfortably
from
sleep
they
had
never
meant
take
The
standing
stone
was
cold
and
cast
long
pale
shadow
that
stretched
eastward
over
them
The
sun
pale
and
watery
yellow
was
gleaming
through
the
mist
just
above
the
west
wall
the
hollow
which
they
lay
north
south
and
east
beyond
the
wall
the
fog
was
thick
cold
and
white
The
air
was
silent
heavy
and
chill
Their
ponies
were
standing
crowded
together
with
their
heads
down

They
found
that

Even
they
looked
out
dismay
towards
the

sank
before
their
eyes
into

cold

sprang
the

The

the

They
still
remembered
the
hopeful

they
had
had

they
still
knew
which
direction
lay
any
case
they
now
had
great
dislike
for
that
hollow
place
about
the
stone
that
thought
remaining
there
was
their
minds
They
packed
quickly
their
chilled
fingers
would
work
Soon
they
were
leading
their
ponies
single
file
over
the
rim
and
down
the
long
northward
slope
the
hill
down
into
foggy
sea
they
went
down
the
mist
became
colder
and
damper
and
their
hair
hung
lank
and
dripping
their
foreheads
When
they
reached
the
bottom
was
chill
that
they
halted
and
got
out
cloaks
and
hoods
which
soon
became
bedewed
with
grey
drops
Then
mounting
their
ponies
they
went
slowly
again
feeling
their
way
the
rise
and
fall
the
ground
They
were
steering
well
they
could
guess
for
the
gate
like
opening
the
far
northward
end
the
long
valley
which
they
had
seen
the
morning
Once
they
were
through
the
gap
they
had
only
keep
anything
like
straight
line
and
they
were
bound
the
end
strike
the
Road
Their
thoughts
did
not
beyond
that
except
for
vague
hope
that
perhaps
away
beyond
the
Downs
there
might
fog
Their
going
was
very
slow
prevent
their
getting
separated
and
wandering
different
directions
they
went
file
with
Frodo
leading
Sam
was
behind
him
and
after
him
came
Pippin
and
then
Merry
The
valley
seemed
stretch
endlessly
Suddenly
Frodo
saw
hopeful
sign
either
side
ahead
darkness
began
loom
through
the
mist
and
guessed
that
they
were
last
approaching
the
gap
the
hills
the
north
gate
the
Barrow
downs
they
could
pass
that
they
would
free
Come
Follow
called
back
over
his
shoulder
and
hurried
forward
But
his
hope
soon
changed
bewilderment
and
alarm
The
dark
patches
grew
darker
but
they
shrank
and
suddenly
saw
towering
ominous
before
him
and
leaning
slightly
towards
one
another
like
the
pillars
headless
door
two
huge
standing
stones
could
not
remember
having
seen
any
sign
these

valley
when
looked
out
from
the
hill
the
morning
had
passed
between
them
almost
before
was
aware
and
even
did
darkness
seemed
fall
round
him
His
pony
reared
and
snorted
and
fell
off
When
looked
back
found
that
was
alone
the
others
had
not
followed
him
Sam
called
Pippin
Merry
Come
along
Why
don
you
keep
There
was
answer
Fear
took
him
and
ran
back
past
the
stones
shouting
wildly
Sam
Sam
Merry
Pippin
The
pony
bolted
into
the
mist
and
vanished
From
some
way
off
seemed
thought
heard
cry
Hoy
Frodo
Hoy
was
away
eastward
his
left
stood
under
the
great
stones
staring
and
straining
into
the
gloom
plunged
off
the
direction
the
call
and
found
himself
going
steeply
uphill
struggled
called
again
and
kept
calling
more
and
more
frantically
but
heard
answer
for
some
time
and
then
seemed
faint
and
far
ahead
and
high
above
him
Frodo
Hoy
came
the
thin
voices
out
the
mist
and
then
cry
that
sounded
like
help
help
often
repeated
ending
with
last
help
that
trailed
off
into
long
wail
suddenly
cut
short
stumbled
forward
with
all
the
speed
could
towards
the
cries
but
the
light
was
now
gone
and
clinging
night
had
closed
about
him
that
was
impossible
sure
any
direction
seemed
all
the
time
climbing
and
Only
the
change
the
level
the
ground
his
feet
told
him
when
last
came
the
top
ridge
hill
was
weary
sweating
and
yet
chilled
was
wholly
dark
Where
are
you
cried
out
miserably
There
was
reply
stood
listening
was
suddenly
aware
that
was
getting
very
cold
and
that
here
wind
was
beginning
blow
icy
wind
change
was
coming
the
weather
The
mist
was
flowing
past
him
now
shreds
and
tatters
His
breath
was
smoking
and
the
darkness
was
less
near
and
thick
looked
and
saw
with
surprise
that
faint
stars
were
appearing
overhead
amid
the
strands
hurrying
cloud
and
fog
The
wind
began
hiss
over
the
grass
imagined
suddenly
that
caught
muffled
cry
and
made
towards
and
even
went
forward
the
mist
was
rolled
and
thrust
aside
and
the
starry
sky
was
unveiled
glance
showed
him
that
was
now
facing
southwards
and
was
round
hill
top
which
must
have
climbed
from
the
north
Out
the
east
the
biting
wind
was
blowing
his
right
there
loomed
against
the
west
ward

dark
black
shape
great

stood
there
Where
are
you
cried
again
both
angry
and
afraid

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Here
said
voice
deep
and
cold
that
seemed
come
out
the
ground
waiting
for
you
said
Frodo
but
did
not
run
away
His
knees
gave
and
fell
the
ground
Nothing
happened
and
there
was
sound
Trembling
looked
time
see
tall
dark
figure
like
shadow
against
the
stars
leaned
over
him
thought
there
were
two
eyes
very
cold
though
lit
with
pale
light
that
seemed
come
from
some
remote
distance
Then
grip
stronger
and
colder
than
iron
seized
him
The
icy
touch
froze
his
bones
and
remembered
more
When
came
himself
again
for
moment
could
recall
nothing
except
sense
dread
Then
suddenly
knew
that
was
imprisoned
caught
hopelessly
was
barrow
Barrow
wight
had
taken
him
and
was
probably
already
under
the
dreadful
spells
the
Barrow
wights
about
which
whispered
tales
spoke
dared
not
move
but
lay
found
himself
flat
his
back
upon
cold
stone
with
his
hands
his
breast
But
though
his
fear
was
great
that
seemed
part
the
very
darkness
that
was
round
him
found
himself
lay
thinking
about
Bilbo
Baggins
and
his
stories
their
jogging
along
together
the
lanes
the
Shire
and
talking
about
roads
and
adventures
There
seed
courage
hidden
often
deeply
true
the
heart
the
fattest
and
most
timid
hobbit
waiting
for
some
final
and
desperate
danger
make
grow
Frodo
was
neither
very
fat
nor
very
timid
indeed
though
did
not
know
Bilbo
and
Gandalf
had
thought
him
the
best
hobbit
the
Shire
thought
had
come
the
end
his
adventure
and
terrible
end
but
the
thought
hardened
him
found
himself
stiffening
for
final
spring
longer
felt
limp
like
helpless
prey
lay
there
thinking
and
getting
hold
himself
noticed
all
once
that
the
darkness
was
slowly
giving
way
pale
greenish
light
was
growing
round
him
did
not
first
show
him
what
kind
place
was
for
the
light
seemed
coming
out
himself
and
from
the
floor
beside
him
and
had
not
yet
reached
the
roof
wall
turned
and
there
the
cold
glow
saw
lying
beside
him
Sam
Pippin
and
Merry
They
were
their
backs
and
their
faces
looked
deathly
pale
and
they
were
clad
white
About
them
lay
many
treasures
gold
maybe
though
that
light
they
looked
cold
and
unlovely
their
heads
were
circlets
gold
chains
were
about
their
waists
and
their
fingers
were
many
rings
Swords
lay
their
sides
and
shields
were
their
feet
But
across
their
three
necks
lay
one
long
naked
sword

Suddenly
song
began
cold
murmur
rising
and
falling
The
voice
seemed
far
away
and
immeasurably
dreary
sometimes
high
the
air
and
thin
sometimes
like
low
moan
from
the
ground
Out
the
formless
stream
sad
but
horrible
sounds
strings
words
would
now
and
again
shape
themselves
grim
hard
cold
words
heartless
and
miserable
The
night
was
railing
against
the
morning
which
was
bereaved
and
the
cold
was
cursing
the
warmth
for
which
hungered
Frodo
was
chilled
the
marrow
After
while
the
song
became
clearer
and
with
dread
his
heart
perceived
that
had
changed
into
incantation
Cold
hand
and
heart
and
bone
and
cold
sleep
under
stone
never
more
wake
stony
bed
never
till
the
Sun
fails
and
the
Moon
dead
the
black
wind
the
stars
shall
die
and
still
gold
here
let
them
lie
till
the
dark
lord
lifts
his
hand
over
dead
sea
and
withered
land
heard
behind
his
head
creaking
and
scraping
sound
Raising
himself
one
arm
looked
and
saw
now
the
pale
light
that
they
were
kind
passage
which
behind
them
turned
corner
Round
the
corner
long
arm
was
groping
walking
its
fingers
towards
Sam
who
was
lying
nearest
and
towards
the
hilt
the
sword
that
lay
upon
him
first
Frodo
felt
had
indeed
been
turned
into
stone
the
incantation
Then
wild
thought
escape
came
him
wondered
put
the
Ring
whether
the
Barrow
wight
would
miss
him
and
might
find
some
way
out
thought
himself
running
free
over
the
grass
grieving
for
Merry
and
Sam
and
Pippin
but
free
and
alive
himself
Gandalf
would
admit
that
there
had
been
nothing
else
could
But
the
courage
that
had
been
awakened
him
was
now
too
strong
could
not
leave
his
friends
easily
wavered
groping
his
pocket
and
then
fought
with
himself
again
and
did
the
arm
crept
nearer
Suddenly
resolve
hardened
him
and
seized
short
sword
that
lay
beside
him
and
kneeling
stooped
low
over
the
bodies
his
companions
With
what
strength
had
hewed
the
crawling
arm
near
the
wrist
and
the
hand
broke
off
but
the
same
moment
the
sword
splintered
the
hilt
There
was
shriek
and
the
light
vanished
the
dark
there
was
snarling
noise
Frodo
fell
forward
over
Merry
and
Merry
face
felt
cold

THE

once
back
into
his
mind
from
which
had
disappeared
with
the
first
coming
the
fog
came
the
memory
the
house
down
under
the
Hill
and
Tom
singing
remembered
the
rhyme
that
Tom
had
taught
them
small
desperate
voice
began
Tom
Bombadil
and
with
that
name
his
voice
seemed
grow
strong
had
full
and
lively
sound
and
the
dark
chamber
echoed
drum
and
trumpet

Come
Tom

for
our
need
near
There
was
sudden
deep
silence
which
Frodo
could
hear
his
heart
beating
After
long
slow
moment
heard
plain
but
far
away
was
coming
down
through
the
ground
through
thick
walls
answering
voice
singing
Old
Tom
Bombadil
merry
fellow
Bright
blue
his
jacket
and
his
boots
are
yellow
None
has
ever
caught
him
yet
for
Tom
the
master
His
songs
are
stronger
songs
and
his
feet
are
faster
There
was
loud
rumbling
sound
stones
rolling
and
falling
and
suddenly
light
streamed
real
light
the
plain
light
day
low
door
like
opening
appeared
the
end
the
chamber
beyond
Frodo
feet
and
there
was
Tom
head
hat
feather
and
all
framed
against
the
light
the
sun
rising
red
behind
him
The
light
fell
upon
the
floor
and
upon
the
faces
the
three
hobbits
lying
beside
Frodo
They
did
not
stir
but
the
sickly
hue
had
left
them
They
looked
now
they
were
only
very
deeply
asleep
Tom
stooped
removed
his
hat
and
came
into
the
dark
chamber
singing
Get
out
you
old
Wight
Vanish
the
sunlight
Shrivel
like
the
cold
mist
like
the
winds
wailing
Out
into
the
barren
lands
far
beyond
the
mountains
Come
never
here
again
Leave
your
barrow
empty
Lost
and
forgotten
darker
than
the
darkness
Where
gates
stand
for
ever
shut
till
the
world
mended
these
words
there
was
cry
and
part
the
inner
end
the
chamber
fell
with
crash
Then
there
was
long
trailing
shriek
fading
away
into
unguessable
distance
and
after
that
silence

Come
friend
Frodo
said
Tom
Let
get
out
clean
grass
You
must
help
bear
them
Together
they
carried
out
Merry
Pippin
and
Sam
Frodo
left
the
barrow
for
the
last
time
thought
saw
severed
hand

gling
still
like

Tom
went
back
again
and
there
was
sound
much
thumping
and
stamp
ing
When
came
out
was
bearing
his
arms
great
load
treasure
things
gold
silver
copper
and
bronze
many
beads
and
chains
and
jewelled
ornaments
climbed
the
green
barrow
and
laid
them
all
top
the
sunshine
There
stood
with
his
hat
his
hand
and
the
wind
his
hair
and
looked
down
upon
the
three
hobbits
that
had
been
laid
their
backs
upon
the
grass
the
west
side
the
mound
Raising
his
right
hand
said
clear
and

Wake

the

stirred
stretched
their

rubbed
their

then
suddenly
sprang
They
looked

first
Frodo

then
Tom
standing

the

above
them
and
then
themselves
their
thin

crowned
and
belted
with
pale

and
jingling
with
trinkets
What
the

wonder
began
Merry
feeling
the
golden
circlet
that
had
slipped
over
one
eye
Then
stopped
and
shadow
came
over
his
face
and
closed
his
eyes

You

said
Tom
bounding
down
from
the
mound
and
laughing
danced
round
them
the
sunlight
One
would
have
thought
that
nothing
dangerous
dreadful
had
happened
and
indeed
the
horror
faded
out
their
hearts
they
looked
him
and
saw
the
merry
glint
his
eyes

THE
LORD

What
you
mean
asked
Pippin
looking
him
half
puzzled
and
half
amused
Why
not
But
Tom
shook
his
head
saying
You
found
yourselves
again
out
the
deep
water
Clothes
are
but
little
loss
you
escape
from
drowning

and

Cast
off
these

Run
naked

while
Tom
goes
hunting
sprang
away
down
hill
whistling
and
calling
Looking
down
after
him
Frodo
saw
him
running
away
southwards
along
the
green
hollow
between
their
hill
and
the
next
still
whistling
and
crying
Hey

Come

Whither

Sharp

Wise

for
some
time
his
hey

now
came
floating
back
down
the
wind
which
had
shifted
round
towards
the
south
The
air
was
growing
very
warm
again
The
hobbits
ran
about
for
while
the
grass
told
them
Then
they
lay
basking

Merry
whom
the

belonged
had
not

given
them
any
such
names
but
they
answered
the
new
names
that
Tom
had
given
them
for
the
rest
their
lives
Tom
called
them
one
one
and
they
climbed
over
the
brow
and
stood

Then
Tom
bowed
the
hobbits
Here
are
your
ponies
now
said
They
more
sense
some
ways
than
you
wandering
hobbits
have
more
sense

For
they
sniff

ahead
which
you
walk

from

they
soon
felt
too
hot

your
ponies
stayed
with
they
got
know
Lumpkin
and
they
smelt
him
the
night
and
quickly
ran
meet
him
thought
look
for
them
and
with
his
words
wisdom
take
all
their
fear
away
But
now
jolly
Lumpkin
old
Tom
going
ride
Hey
coming
with
you
just
set
you
the
road
needs
pony
For
you
cannot
easily
talk
hobbits
that
are
riding
when
you
your
own
legs
trying
trot
beside
them
The
hobbits
were
delighted
hear
this
and
thanked
Tom
many
times
but
laughed
and
said
that
they
were
good
losing
themselves
that
would
not
feel
happy
till
had
seen
them
safe
over
the
borders
his
land
got
things
said
making
and
singing
talking
and
walking
and
watching
the
country
Tom
can
always
near
open
doors
and
willow
cracks
Tom
has
his
house
mind
and
Goldberry
waiting
was
still
fairly
early
the
sun
something
between
nine
and
ten
and
the
hobbits
turned
their
minds
food
Their
last
meal
had
been
lunch
beside
the
standing
stone
the
day
before
They
breakfasted
now
off
the
remainder
Tom
provisions
meant
for
their
supper
with
additions
that
Tom
had
brought
with
him
was
not
large
meal
considering
hobbits
and
the
circumstances
but
they
felt
much
better
for
While
they
were
eating
Tom
went
the
mound
and
looked
through
the
treasures
Most
these
made
into
pile
that
glistered
and
sparkled
the
grass
bade
them
lie
there
free
all
finders
birds
beasts
Elves
Men
and
all
kindly
creatures
for
the
spell
the
mound
should
broken
and
scattered
and
Wight
ever
come
back
chose
for
himself
from
the
pile
brooch
set
with
blue
stones
many
shaded
like
flax
flowers
the
wings
blue
butterflies
looked
long
stirred
some
memory
shaking
his
head
and
saying
last
Here
pretty
toy
for
Tom
and
for
his
lady
Fair
was
she
who
long
ago
wore
this
her
shoulder
Goldberry
shall
wear
now
and
will
not
forget
her
For
each
the
hobbits
chose
dagger
long
leaf
shaped
and
keen
marvellous
workmanship
damasked
with
serpent
forms
red
and
gold
They
gleamed
drew
them
from
their
black
sheaths
wrought
some
strange
metal
light
and
strong
and
set
with
many

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
fiery
stones
Whether
some
virtue
these
sheaths
because
the
spell
that
lay
the
mound
the
blades
seemed
untouched
time
unrusted
sharp
glittering
the
sun
Old
knives
are
long
enough
swords
for
hobbit
people
said
Sharp
blades
are
good
have
Shire
folk
walking
east
south
far
away
into
dark
and
danger
Then
told
them
that
these
blades
were
forged
many
long
years
ago
Men
Westernesse
they
were
foes
the
Dark
Lord
but
they
were
overcome
the
evil
king
Carn
Dim
the
Land
Angmar
Few
now
remember
them
Tom
murmured
yet
still
some
wandering
sons
forgotten
kings
walking
loneliness
guarding
from
evil
things
folk
that
are
heedless
The
hobbits
did
not
understand
his
words
but
spoke
they
had
vision
were
great
expanse
years
behind
them
like
vast
shadowy
plain
over
which
there
strode
shapes
Men
tall
and
grim
with
bright
swords
and
last
came
one
with
star
his
brow
Then
the
vision
faded
and
they
were
back
the
sunlit
world
was
time
start
again
They
made
ready
packing
their
bags
and
lading
their
ponies
Their
new
weapons
they
hung
their
leather
belts
under
their
jackets
feeling
them
very
awkward
and
wondering
they
would
any
use
Fighting
had
not
before
occurred
any
them
one
the
adventures
which
their
flight
would
land
them
last
they
set
off
They
led
their
ponies
down
the
hill
and
then
mounting
they
trotted
quickly
along
the
valley
They
looked
back
and
saw
the
top
the
old
mound
the
hill
and
from
the
sunlight
the
gold
went
like
yellow
flame
Then
they
turned
shoulder
the
Downs
and
was
hidden
from
view
Though
Frodo
looked
about
him
every
side
saw
sign
the
great
stones
standing
like
gate
and
before
long
they
came
the
northern
gap
and
rode
swiftly
through
and
the
land
fell
away
before
them
was
merry
journey
with
Tom
Bombadil
trotting
gaily
beside
them
before
them
Fatty
Lumpkin
who
could
move
much
faster
than
his
girth
promised
Tom
sang
most
the
time
but
was
chiefly
nonsense
else
perhaps
strange
language
unknown
the
hobbits
ancient
language
whose
words
were
mainly
those
wonder
and
delight
They
went
forward
steadily
but
they
soon
saw
that
the
Road
was
further
away
than
they
had
imagined
Even
without
fog
their
sleep
mid
day
would
have
prevented
them
from
reaching
until
after
nightfall
the
day
before
The
dark
line
they
had
seen
was
not
line
trees
but
line
bushes
growing
the
edge
deep
dike
with
steep
wall
the
further
side
Tom
said
that
had
once
been
FOG
THE
BARROW
DOWNS
147
the
boundary
kingdom
but
very
long
time
ago
seemed
remember
something
sad
about
and
would
not
say
much
They
climbed
down
and
out
the
dike
and
through
gap
the
wall
and
then
Tom
turned
due
north
for
they
had
been
bearing
somewhat
the
west
The
land
was
now
open
and
fairly
level
and
they
quickened
their
pace
but
the
sun
was
already
sinking
low
when
last
they
saw
line
tall
trees
ahead
and
they
knew
that
they
had
come
back
the
Road
after
many
unexpected
adventures
They
galloped
their
ponies
over
the
last
furlongs
and
halted
under
the
long
shadows
the
trees
They
were
the
top
sloping
bank
and
the
Road
now
dim
evening
drew
wound
away
below
them
this
point
ran
nearly
from
South
west
North
east
and
their
right
fell
quickly
down
into
wide
hollow
was
rutted
and
bore
many
signs
the
recent
heavy
rain
there
were
pools
and
pot
holes
full
water
They
rode
down
the
bank
and
looked
and
down
There
was
nothing
seen
Well
here
are
again
last
said
Frodo
suppose
haven
lost
more
than
two
days
short
cut
through
the
Forest
But
perhaps
the
delay
will
prove
useful
may
have
put
them
off
our
trail
The
others
looked
him
The
shadow
the
fear
the
Black
Riders
came
suddenly
over
them
again
Ever
since
they
had
entered
the
Forest
they
had
thought
chiefly
getting
back
the
Road
only
now
when
lay
beneath
their
feet
did
they
remember
the
danger
which
pursued
them
and
was
more
than
likely
lying
wait
for
them
upon
the
Road
itself
They
looked
anxiously
back
towards
the
setting
sun
but
the
Road
was
brown
and
empty
you
think
asked
Pippin
hesitatingly
you
think
may
pursued
tonight
hope
not
tonight
answered
Tom
Bombadil
nor
perhaps
the
next
day
But
not
trust
guess
for
cannot
tell
for
certain
Out
east
knowledge
fails
Tom
not
master
Riders
from
the
Black
Land
far
beyond
his
country
All
the
same
the
hobbits
wished
was
coming
with
them
They
felt
that
would
know
how
deal
with
Black
Riders
anyone
did
They
would
soon
now
going
forward
into
lands
wholly
strange
them
and
beyond
all
but
the
most
vague
and
distant
legends
the
Shire
and
the
gathering
twilight
they
longed
for
home
deep
loneliness
and
sense
loss
was
them
They
stood
silent
reluctant
make
the
final
parting
and
only
slowly
became
aware
that
Tom
was
wishing
them
farewell
and
telling
them
have
good
heart
and
ride
till
dark
without
halting
Tom
will
give
you
good
advice
till
this
day
over
after
that
your
own
luck
must
with
you
and
guide
you
four
miles
along
148
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
the
Road
you
come
upon
village
Bree
under
Bree
hill
with
doors
looking
westward
There
you
find
old
inn
that
called
The
Prancing
Pony
Barliman
Butterbur
the
worthy
keeper
There
you
can
stay
the
night
and
afterwards
the
morning
will
speed
you
upon
your
way
bold
but
wary
Keep
your
merry
hearts
and
ride
meet
your
fortune
They
begged
him
come
least
far
the
inn
and
drink
once
more
with
them
but
laughed
and
refused
saying
Tom
country
ends
here
will
not
pass
the
borders
Tom
has
his
house
mind
and
Goldberry
waiting
Then
turned
tossed
his
hat
leaped
Lumpkin
back
and
rode
over
the
bank
and
away
singing
into
the
dusk
The
hobbits
climbed
and
watched
him
until
was
out
sight
sorry
take
leave
Master
Bombadil
said
Sam
caution
and
mistake
reckon
may
good
deal
further
and
see
naught
better
nor
queerer
But
won
deny
glad
see
this
Prancing
Pony
spoke
hope
like
The
Green
Dragon
away
back
home
What
sort
folk
are
they
Bree
There
are
hobbits
Bree
said
Merry
well
Big
Folk
daresay
will
homelike
enough
The
Pony
good
inn
all
accounts
people
ride
out
there
now
and
again
may
all
could
wish
said
Frodo
but
outside
the
Shire
all
the
same
Don
make
yourselves
too
much
home
Please
remember
all
you
that
the
name
Baggins
must
NOT
mentioned
Underhill
any
name
must
given
They
now
mounted
their
ponies
and
rode
off
silently
into
the
evening
Darkness
came
down
quickly
they
plodded
slowly
down
hill
and
again
until
last
they
saw
lights
twinkling
some
distance
ahead
Before
them
rose
Bree
hill
barring
the
way
dark
mass
against
misty
stars
and
under
its
western
flank
nestled
large
village
Towards
they
now
hurried
desiring
only
find
fire
and
door
between
them
and
the
night
Chapter
THE
SIGN
THE
PRANCING
PONY
Bree
was
the
chief
village
the
Bree
land
small
inhabited
region
like
island
the
empty
lands
round
about
Besides
Bree
itself
there
was
Staddle
the
other
side
the
hill
Combe
deep
valley
little
further
eastward
and
Archet
the
edge
the
Chet
wood
Lying
round
Bree
hill
and
the
villages
was
small
country
fields
and
tamed
woodland
only
few
miles
broad
The
Men
Bree
were
brown
haired
broad
and
rather
short
cheerful
and
independent
they
belonged
nobody
but
themselves
but
they
were
more
friendly
and
familiar
with
Hobbits
Dwarves
Elves
and
other
inhabitants
the
world
about
them
than
was
usual
with
Big
People
According
their
own
tales
they
were
the
original
inhabitants
and
were
the
descendants
the
first
Men
that
ever
wandered
into
the
West
the
middle
world
Few
had
survived
the
turmoils
the
Elder
Days
but
when
the
Kings
returned
again
over
the
Great
Sea
they
had
found
the
Bree
men
still
there
and
they
were
still
there
now
when
the
memory
the
old
Kings
had
faded
into
the
grass
those
days
other
Men
had
settled
dwellings
far
west
within
hundred
leagues
the
Shire
But
the
wild
lands
beyond
Bree
there
were
mysterious
wanderers
The
Bree
folk
called
them
Rangers
and
knew
nothing
their
origin
They
were
taller
and
darker
than
the
Men
Bree
and
were
believed
have
strange
powers
sight
and
hearing
and
understand
the
languages
beasts
and
birds
They
roamed
will
southwards
and
eastwards
even
far
the
Misty
Mountains
but
they
were
now
few
and
rarely
seen
When
they
appeared
they
brought
news
from
afar
and
told
strange
forgotten
tales
which
were
eagerly
listened
but
the
Bree
folk
did
not
make
friends
them
There
were
also
many
families
hobbits
the
Bree
land
and
they
claimed
the
oldest
settlement
Hobbits
the
world
one
that
was
founded
long
before
even
the
Brandywine
was
crossed
and
the
Shire
colonized
They
lived
mostly
Staddle
though
there
were
some
Bree
itself
especially
the
higher
slopes
the
hill
above
the
houses
the
Men
The
Big
Folk
and
the
Little
Folk
they
called
one
another
were
friendly
terms
minding
their
own
affairs
their
own
ways
but
both
rightly
regarding
themselves
necessary

THE
LORD
THE

parts
the
Bree
folk
Nowhere
else
the
world
was
this
peculiar
but
excellent
arrangement
found
The
Bree
folk
Big
and
Little
did
not
themselves
travel
much
and
the
affairs
the
four
villages
were
their
chief
concern
Occasion
ally
the
Hobbits
Bree
went
far
Buckland
the
Eastfarthing
but
though
their
little
land
was
not
much
further
than
day
riding
east
the
Brandywine
Bridge
the
Hobbits
the
Shire
now
seldom
visited
occasional
Bucklander
adventurous
Took
would
come
out
the
Inn
for
night
two
but
even
that
was
becoming
less
and
less
usual
The
Shire
hobbits
referred
those
Bree
and
any
others
that
lived
beyond
the
borders
Outsiders
and
took
very
little
interest
them
considering
them
dull
and
uncouth
There
were
probably
many
more
Outsiders
scattered
about
the
West
the
World
those
days
than
the
people
the
Shire
imagined
Some
doubtless
were
better
than
tramps
ready
dig
hole
any
bank
and
stay
only
long
suited
them
But
the
Bree
land
any
rate
the
hobbits
were
decent
and
prosperous
and
more
rustic
than
most
their
distant
relatives
Inside
was
not
yet
forgot
ten
that
there
had
been
time
when
there
was
much
coming
and
going
between
the
Shire
and
Bree
There
was
Bree
blood
the
Brandybucks
all
accounts
The
village
Bree
had
some
hundred
stone
houses
the
Big
Folk
mostly
above
the
Road
nestling
the
hillside
with
windows
looking
west
that
side
running
more
than
half
circle
from
the
hill
and
back
there
was
deep
dike
with
thick
hedge
the
inner
side
Over
this
the
Road
crossed
causeway
but
where
pierced
the
hedge
was
barred
great
gate
There
was
another
gate
the
southern
corner
where
the
Road
ran
out
the
village
The
gates
were
closed
nightfall
but
just
inside
them
were
small
lodges
for
the
gatekeepers
Down
the
Road
where
swept
the
right
round
the
foot
the
hill
there
was
large
inn
had
been
built
long
ago
when
the
traffic
the
roads
had
been
far
greater
For
Bree
stood
old
meeting
ways
another
ancient
road
crossed
the
East
Road
just
outside
the
dike
the
western
end
the
village
and
former
days
Men
and
other
folk
various
sorts
had
travelled
much
Strange
News
from
Bree
was
still
saying
the
Eastfarthing
descending
from
those
days
when
news
from
North
South
and
East
could
heard
the
inn
and
when
the
Shire
hobbits
used
more
often
hear
But
the
Northern
Lands
had
long
been
desolate
and
the
North
Road
was
now
seldom
used
was
grass
grown
and
the
Bree
folk
called
the
Greenway
The
Inn
Bree
was
still
there
however
and
the
innkeeper
was
THE
SIGN
THE
PRANCING
PONY
ISI
important
person
His
house
was
meeting
place
for
the
idle
talkative
and
inquisitive
among
the
inhabitants
large
and
small
the
four
villages
and
resort
Rangers
and
other
wanderers
and
for
such
travellers
mostly
dwarves
still
journeyed
the
East
Road
and
from
the
Mountains
was
dark
and
white
stars
were
shining
when
Frodo
and
his
companions
came
last
the
Greenway
crossing
and
drew
near
the
village
They
came
the
West
gate
and
found
shut
but
the
door
the
lodge
beyond
there
was
man
sitting
jumped
and
fetched
lantern
and
looked
over
the
gate
them
surprise
What
you
want
and
where
you
come
from
asked
gruffly
are
making
for
the
inn
here
answered
Frodo
are
jour
neying
east
and
cannot
further
tonight
Hobbits
Four
hobbits
And
what
more
out
the
Shire
their
talk
said
the
gatekeeper
softly
speaking
himself
stared
them
darkly
for
moment
and
then
slowly
opened
the
gate
and
let
them
ride
through
don
often
see
Shire
folk
riding
the
Road
night
went
they
halted
moment
his
door
You
pardon
wondering
what
business
takes
you
away
east
Bree
What
may
your
names
might
ask
Our
names
and
our
business
are
our
own
and
this
does
not
seem
good
place
discuss
them
said
Frodo
not
liking
the
look
the
man
the
tone
his
voice
Your
business
your
own
doubt
said
the
man
but
business
ask
questions
after
nightfall
are
hobbits
from
Buckland
and
have
fancy
travel
and
stay
the
inn
here
put
Merry
Brandybuck
that
enough
for
you
The
Bree
folk
used
fair
spoken
travellers
had
heard
All
right
all
right
said
the
man
meant
offence
But
you
find
maybe
that
more
folk
than
old
Harry
the
gate
will
asking
you
questions
There
queer
folk
about
you
The
Pony
you
find
you
not
the
only
guests
wished
them
good
night
and
they
said
more
but
Frodo
could
see
the
lantern
light
that
the
man
was
still
eyeing
them
curiously
was
glad
hear
the
gate
clang
behind
them
they
rode
forward
wondered
why
the
man
was
suspicious
and
whether
anyone
had
been
asking
for
news
party
hobbits
Could
have
been
Gandalf
might
have
arrived
while
they
were
delayed
the
Forest
and
the
Downs
But
there
was
something
the
look
and
the
voice

THE
LORD

RINGS
The
man
stared
after
the
hobbits
for
moment
and
then
went
back
his
house
soon
his
back
was
turned
dark
figure
climbed
quickly
over
the
gate
and
melted
into
the
shadows
the
village
street
The
hobbits
rode
gentle
slope
passing
few
detached
houses
and
drew
outside
the
inn
The
houses
looked
large
and
strange
them
Sam
stared
the
inn
with
its
three
storeys
and
many
windows
and
felt
his
heart
sink
had
imagined
himself
meeting
giants
taller
than
trees
and
other
creatures
even
more
terrify
ing
some
time
other
the
course
his
journey
but
the
moment
was
finding
his
first
sight
Men
and
their
tall
houses
quite
enough
indeed
too
much
for
the
dark
end
tiring
day
pictured
black
horses
standing
all
saddled
the
shadows
the
inn
yard
and
Black
Riders
peering
out
dark
upper
windows
surely
aren
going
stay
here
for
the
night
are
sir
exclaimed
there
are
hobbit
folk
these
parts
why
don
look
for
some
that

more

What
wrong
with
the

said
Frodo
Tom

mended

Even
from
the
outside
the
inn
looked
pleasant
house
familiar
eyes
had
front
the
Road
and
two
wings
running
back
land
partly
cut
out
the
lower
slopes
the
hill
that
the
rear
the
second
floor
windows
were
level
with
the
ground
There
was
wide
arch
leading
courtyard
between
the
two
wings
and
the
left
under
the
arch
there
was
large
doorway
reached
few
broad
steps
The
door
was
open
and
light
streamed
out
Above
the
arch
there
was
lamp
and
beneath
swung
large
signboard
fat
white
pony
reared
its
hind
legs
Over
the
door
was
painted
white
letters
THE

Many
the
lower
windows
showed
lights
behind
thick
curtains
they
hesitated
outside
the
gloom
someone
began
singing
merry
song
inside
and
many
cheerful
voices
joined
loudly
the
chorus
They
listened
this
encouraging
sound
for
moment
and
then
got
off
their
ponies
The
song
ended
and
there
was
burst
laughter
and
clapping
They
led
their
ponies
under
the
arch
and
leaving
them
standing
the
yard
they
climbed
the
steps
Frodo
went
forward
and
nearly
bumped
into
short
fat
man
with
bald
head
and
red
face
had
white

and
was
bustling
out

through

vanished
into

voices
and

was
out
again
wiping
his

Good

Off
went

and
left
them
feeling
rather
breathless
seemed
capable
endless
stream
talk
however
busy
might
They
found
themselves
small
and
cosy
room
There
was
bit
bright
fire
burning
the
hearth
and
front
were
some
low
and
comfortable
chairs
There
was
round
table
already
spread
with
white

and
was
large

But
Nob
the

bustling

full

They
were

and
the

when
Butterbur

the

was

There
was

The

they

Frodo

Mind

All

Pippin
Mind

The

The

This

from

sitting
chattering
together
few
more
dwarves
and
other
vague
figures
difficult
make
out
away
the
shadows
and
corners
soon
the
Shire
hobbits
entered
there
was
chorus
wel
come
from
the
Bree
landers
The
strangers
especially
those
that
had
come
the
Greenway
stared
them
curiously
The
landlord
intro
duced
the
newcomers
the
Bree
folk
quickly
that
though
they
caught
many
names
they
were
seldom
sure
who
the
names
belonged
The
Men
Bree
seemed
all
have
rather
botanical
and
the
Shire
folk
rather
odd
names
like
Rushlight
Goatleaf
Heathertoes
Appledore
Thistlewool
and
Ferny
not
mention
Butterbur
Some
the
hobbits
had
similar
names
The
Mugworts
for
instance
seemed
numerous
But
most
them
had
natural
names
such
Banks
Brockhouse
Longholes
Sandheaver
and
Tunnelly
many
which
were
used
the
Shire
There
were
several
Underhills
from
Staddle
and
they
could
not
imagine
sharing
name
without
being
related
they
took
Frodo
their
hearts
long
lost
cousin
The
Bree
hobbits
were
fact
friendly
and
inquisitive
and
Frodo
soon
found
that
some
explanation
what
was
doing
would
have
given
gave
out
that
was
interested
history
and
geogra
phy
which
there
was
much
wagging
heads
although
neither
these
words
were
much
used
the
Bree
dialect
said
was
thinking
writing
book
which
there
was
silent
astonishment
and
that
and
his
friends
wanted
collect
information
about
hobbits
living
outside
the
Shire
especially
the
eastern
lands
this
chorus
voices
broke
out
Frodo
had
really
wanted
write
book
and
had
had
many
ears
would
have
learned
enough
for
several
chapters
few
minutes
And
that
was
not
enough
was
given
whole
list
names
beginning
with
Old
Barliman
here
whom
could
for
further
information
But
after
time
Frodo
did
not
show
any
sign
writing
book
the
spot
the
hobbits
returned
their
questions
about
doings
the
Shire
Frodo
did
not
prove
very
communicative
and
soon
found
himself
sitting
alone
corner
listening
and
looking
around
The
Men
and
Dwarves
were
mostly
talking
distant
events
and
telling
news
kind
that
was
becoming
only
too
familiar
There
was
trouble
away
the
South
and
seemed
that
the
Men
who
had
come
the
Greenway
were
the
move
looking
for
lands
where
they
could
find
some
peace
The
Bree
folk
were
sympathetic
but
plainly
not
very
ready
take
large
number
strangers
into
their
little
land
One
the
travellers
squint
eyed
ill
favoured
fellow
was
foretelling
that
more
and
more
people
would
coming
north
the
near
future
room
isn
found
for
them
they
find
for
themselves
They
right

said
loudly
The
local
inhabitants
did
not
look
pleased
the
prospect
156
THE
LORD

RINGS
The
hobbits
did
not
pay
much
attention
all
this
did
not
the
moment
seem
concern
hobbits
Big
Folk
could
hardly
beg
for
lodgings
hobbit
holes
They
were
more
interested
Sam
and
Pippin
who
were
now
feeling
quite
home
and
were
chatting
gaily
about
events
the
Shire
Pippin
roused
good
deal
laughter
with
account
the
collapse
the
roof
the
Town
Hole
Michel
Delving
Will
Whitfoot
the
Mayor
and
the
fattest
hobbit
the
Westfarthing
had
been
buried
chalk
and
came
out
like
floured
dumpling
But
there
were
several
questions
asked
that
made
Frodo
little
uneasy
One
the
Bree
landers
who
seemed
have
been
the
Shire
several
times
wanted
know
where
the
Underhills
lived
and
who
they
were
related
Suddenly
Frodo
noticed
that
strange
looking
weather
beaten
man
sitting
the
shadows
near
the
wall
was
also
listening
intently
the
hobbit
talk
had
tall
tankard
front
him
and
was
smoking
long
stemmed
pipe
curiously
carved
His
legs
were
stretched
out
before
him
showing
high
boots
supple
leather
that
fitted
him
well
but
had
seen
much
wear
and
were
now
caked
with
mud
travel
stained
cloak
heavy
dark
green
cloth
was
drawn
close
about
him
and
spite
the
heat
the
room
wore
hood
that
overshadowed
his
face
but
the
gleam
his
eyes
could
seen
watched
the
hobbits
Who
that
Frodo
asked
when
got
chance

think

him

Bree

begging
your
pardon
Funny
you
should
ask
about
him
But
that
moment
Butterbur
was
called
away
demand
for
more
ale
and
his
last
remark
remained
unexplained
Frodo
found
that
Strider
was
now
looking
him
had
heard
guessed
all
that
had
been
said
Presently
with
wave
his
hand
and
nod
invited
Frodo
come
over
and
sit
him
Frodo
drew
near

and

Butterbur

Frodo
stiffly
felt
far
from
comfortable
under
the

those
keen

Well
Master
Underhill
said
Strider
were

your

with

And
there
have

stranger
travellers

went
watching
Frodo

Frodo
returned
his
gaze
but
said
nothing
and
Strider
made
further
sign
His
attention
seemed
suddenly
fixed
Pippin
his
alarm
Frodo
became
aware
that
the
ridiculous
young
Took
encouraged
his
success
with
the
fat
Mayor
Michel
Delving
was
now
actually
giving
comic
account
Bilbo
farewell
party
was
already
giving
imitation
the
Speech
and
was
drawing
near
the
astonishing
Disappearance
Frodo
was
annoyed
was
harmless
enough
tale
for
most
the
local
hobbits
doubt
just
funny
story
about
those
funny
people
away
beyond
the
River
but
some
old
Butterbur
for
instance
knew
thing
two
and
had
probably
heard
rumours
long
ago
about
Bilbo
vanishing
would
bring
the
name
Baggins
their
minds
especially
there
had
been
inquiries
Bree
after
that
name
Frodo
fidgeted
wondering
what
Pippin
was
evidently
much
enjoying
the
attention
was
getting
and
had
become
quite
forgetful
their
danger
Frodo
had
sudden
fear
that
his
present
mood
might
even
mention
the
Ring
and
that
might
well
disastrous
You
had
better
something
quick
whispered
Strider
his
ear
Frodo
jumped
and
stood
table
and
began
talk
The
attention
Pippin
audience
was
disturbed
Some
the
hobbits
looked
Frodo
and
laughed
and
clapped
thinking
that
Underhill
had
taken
much
ale
was
good
for
him
Frodo
suddenly
felt
very
foolish
and
found
himself
was
his
habit
when
making
speech
fingering
the
things
his
pocket
felt
the
Ring
its
chain
and
quite
unaccountably
the
desire
came
over
him
slip
and
vanish
out
the
silly
situation
seemed
him
somehow
the
suggestion
came
him
from
outside
from
someone
something
the
room
resisted
the
temptation
firmly
and
clasped
the
Ring
his
hand
keep
hold
and
prevent
from
escaping
doing
any
mischief
any

gave
him

The
Man
the
Moon
was
drinking
deep
and
the
cat
began
wail
dish
and
spoon
the
table
danced
The
cow
the
garden
madly
pranced
and
the
little
dog
chased
his
tail
The
Man
the
Moon
took
another
mug
and
then
rolled
beneath
his
chair
And
there
dozed
and
dreamed
ale
Till
the
sky
the
stars
were
pale
and
dawn
was
the
air
Then
the
ostler
said
his
tipsy
cat
The
white
horses
the
Moon
They
neigh
and
champ
their
silver
bits
But
their
master
been
and
drowned
his
wits
and
the
Sun
rising
soon
the
cat
his
fiddle
played
hey
diddle
diddle
jig
that
would
wake
the
dead
squeaked
and
sawed
and
quickened
the
tune
While
the
landlord
shook
the
Man
the
Moon
after
three
said
They
rolled
the
Man
slowly
the
hill
and
bundled
him
into
the
Moon
While
his
horses
galloped
rear
And
the
cow
came
capering
like
deer
and
dish
ran
with
the
spoon
Now
quicker
the
fiddle
went
deedle
dum
diddle
the
dog
began
roar
The
cow
and
the
horses
stood
their
heads
The
guests
all
bounded
from
their
beds
and
danced
upon
the
floor
With
ping
and
pong
the
fiddle
strings
broke
the
cow
jumped
over
the
Moon
And
the
little
dog
laughed
see
such
fun
And
the
Saturday
dish
went
off
run
with
the
silver
Sunday
spoon

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
The
round
Moon
rolled
behind
the
hill
the
Sun
ratsed
her
head
She
hardly
believed
her
fiery
eyes
For
though
was
day
her
surprise
they
all
went
back
bed
There
was
loud
and
long
applause
Frodo
had
good
voice
and
the
song
tickled
their
fancy
Where
old
Barley
they
cried
ought
hear
this
Bob
ought
learn
his
cat
the
fiddle
and
then
have
dance
They
called
for
more
ale
and
began
shout
Let
have
again
master
Come
now
Once
more
They
made
Frodo
have
another
drink
and
then
begin
his
song
again
while
many
them
joined
for
the
tune
was
well
known
and
they
were
quick
picking
words
was
now
Frodo
turn
feel
pleased
with
himself
capered
about
the
table
and
when
came
second
time
the
cow
jumped
over
the
Moon
leaped
the
air
Much
too
vigorously
for
came
down
bang
into
tray
full
mugs
and
slipped
and
rolled
off
the
table
with
crash
clatter
and
bump
The
audience
all
opened
their
mouths
wide
for
laughter
and
stopped
short
gaping
silence
for
the
singer
dis
appeared
simply
vanished
had
gone
slap
through
the
floor
without
leaving
hole
The
local
hobbits
stared
amazement
and
then
sprang
their
feet
and
shouted
for
Barliman
All
the
company
drew
away
from
Pippin
and
Sam
who
found
themselves
left
alone
corner
and
eyed
darkly
and
doubtfully
from
distance
was
plain
that
many
people
regarded
them
now
the
companions
travelling
magician
unknown
powers
and
purpose
But
there
was
one
swarthy
Bree
lander
who
stood
looking
them
with
knowing
and
half
mocking
expression
that
made
them
feel
very
uncomfortable
Presently
slipped
out
the
door
followed
the
squint
eyed
southerner
the
two
had
been
whispering
together
good
deal
during
the
evening
Frodo
felt
fool
Not
knowing
what
else
crawled
away
under
the
tables
the
dark
corner
Strider
who
sat
unmoved
giving
sign
his
thoughts
Frodo
leaned
back
against
the
wall
and
took
off
the
Ring
How
came
his
finger
could
not
tell
could
only
suppose
that
had
been
handling
his
pocket
while
sang
and
that
somehow
had
slipped
when
stuck
out
his
hand
with
jerk
save
his
fall
For
moment
wondered
the
Ring
itself
had
not
played
him
trick
perhaps
had
tried
reveal
itself
response
some
wish
command
that
was
felt
the
room
did
not
like
the
looks
the
men
that
had
gone
out
Elves
and
Hobbits
always
refer

Well
said
Strider
when
reappeared
Why
did
you
that
Worse
than
anything
your
friends
could
have
said
You
have
put
your
foot
should
say
your
finger
don
know
what
you
mean
said
Frodo
annoyed
and
alarmed
yes
you
answered
Strider
but
had
better
wait
until
the
uproar
has
died
down
Then
you
please
Baggins
should
like
quiet
word
with
you
What
about
asked
Frodo
ignoring
the
sudden
use
his
proper
name
matter
some
importance
both
answered
Strider
looking
Frodo
the
eye
You
may
hear
something
your
advantage
Very
well
said
Frodo
trying
appear
unconcerned
talk
you
later
Meanwhile
argument
was
going
the
fireplace
Butterbur
had
come
trotting
and
was
now
trying
listen
several
conflicting
accounts
the
event
the
same
time
saw
him
Butterbur
said
hobbit
leastways
didn
see
him
you
take
meaning
just
vanished
into
thin
air
manner
speaking
You
don
say
Mugwort
said
the
landlord
looking
puzzled
Yes
replied
Mugwort
And
mean
what
say
what
more
There
some
mistake
somewhere
said
Butterbur
shaking
his
head
There
was
too
much
that
Underhill
vanishing
into
thin
air
into
thick
air
more
likely
this
room
Well
where
now
cried
several
voices
How
should
know
welcome
where
will
long
pays
the
morning
There
Took
now
not
vanished
Well
saw
what
saw
and
saw
what
didn
said
Mugwort
obstinately
And
say
there
some
mistake
repeated
Butterbur
picking
the
tray
and
gathering
the
broken
crockery
course
there
mistake
said
Frodo
haven
vanished
Here
just
been
having
few
words
with
Strider
the
corner
came
forward
into
the
firelight
but
most
the
company
backed
away
even
more
perturbed
than
before
They
were
not
the
least
satisfied
his
explanation
that
had
crawled
away
quickly
under
the
tables
after
had
fallen
Most
the
Hobbits
and
the
Men
Bree
went
off
then
and
there
huff
having
fancy
for
further
entertainment
that
evening
One
two
gave
Frodo
black
look
and
departed
muttering
among
themselves
The
Dwarves
and
the
two
three
strange
Men
that
still
remained
got
and
said
good
night
the
landlord
but
not
Frodo
and
his
friends
Before
162
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
long
one
was
left
but
Strider
who
sat
unnoticed
the
wall
Butterbur
did
not
seem
much
put
out
reckoned
very
probably
that
his
house
would
full
again
many
future
nights
until
the
present
mystery
had
been
thoroughly
discussed
Now
what
have
you
been
doing
Underhill
asked
Frightening
customers
and
breaking
crocks
with
your
acrobatics
very
sorry
have
caused
any
trouble
said
Frodo
was
quite
unintentional
assure
you
most
unfortunate
accident
All
right
Underhill
But
you
going
any
more
tumbling
conjuring
whatever
was
you
best
warn
folk
beforehand
and
warn
bit
suspicious
round
here
anything
out
the
way
uncanny
you
understand
and
don
take
all
sudden
shan
doing
anything
the
sort
again
Butterbur
promise
you
And
now
think
getting
bed
shall
making
early
start
Will
you
see
that
our
ponies
are
ready
eight
clock
Very
good
But
before
you
should
like
word
with
you
private
Underhill
Something
has
just
come
back
mind
that
ought
tell
you
hope
that
you
not
take
amiss
When
seen
thing
two
Ill
come
along
your
room
you
willing
Certainly
said
Frodo
but
his
heart
sank
wondered
how
many
private
talks
would
have
before
got
bed
and
what
they
would
reveal
Were
these
people
all
league
against
him
began
suspect
even
old
Butterbur
fat
face
concealing
dark
designs

STRIDER
Frodo
Pippin
and
Sam
made
their
way
back
the
parlour
There
was
light
Merry
was
not
there
and
the
fire
had
burned
low
was
not
until
they
had
puffed
the
embers
into
blaze
and
thrown
couple
faggots
that
they
discovered
Strider
had
come
with
them
There
was
calmly
sitting
chair
the
door
Hallo
said
Pippin
Who
are
you
and
what
you
want
called
Strider
answered
and
though
may
have
for
gotten
your
friend
promised
have
quiet
talk
with
You
said
might
hear
something
advantage
believe
said
Frodo
What
have
you
say
Several
things
answered
Strider
But
course
have
price
What
you
mean
asked
Frodo
sharply
Don
alarmed
mean
just
this
will
tell
you
what
know
and
give
you
some
good
advice
but
shall
want
reward
And
what
will
that
pray
said
Frodo
suspected
now
that
had
fallen
with
rascal
and
thought
uncomfortably
that
had
brought
only
little
money
with
him
All
would
hardly
satisfy
rogue
and
could
not
spare
any
more
than
you
can
afford
answered
Strider
with
slow
smile
guessed
Frodo
thoughts
Just
this
you
must
take
along
with
you
until
wish
leave
you
indeed
replied
Frodo
surprised
but
not
much
relieved
Even
wanted
another
companion
should
not
agree
any
such
thing
until
knew
good
deal
more
about
you
and
your
business
Excellent
exclaimed
Strider
crossing
his
legs
and
sitting
back
comfortably
You
seem
coming
your
senses
again
and
that
all
the
good
You
have
been
much
too
careless
far
Very
well
will
tell
you
what
know
and
leave
the
reward
you
You
may
glad
grant
when
you
have
heard
then
said
Frodo
What
you
know
Too
much
too
many
dark
things
said
Strider
grimly
But
for
your
business
got
and
went
the
door
opened
quickly
and
looked
out
Then
shut
quietly
and
sat
down
again
have
quick
ears
went
lowering
his
voice
and
though
cannot
disappear
have
hunted
many
wild
and
wary
things
and
can
usually
avoid
being
seen
wish
Now
was
behind
the
hedge
this
evening
the
Road
west
Bree
when
four
hobbits
came
out
the
Downlands
need
not
repeat
all
that
they
said
old
Bombadil
164
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
one
another
but
one
thing
interested
Please
remember
said
one
them
that
the
name
Baggins
must
not
mentioned
Underhill
any
name
must
given
That
interested
much
that
followed
them
here
slipped
over
the
gate
just
behind
them
Maybe
Baggins
has
honest
reason
for
leaving
his
name
behind
but
should
advise
him
and
his
friends
more
careful
don
see
what
interest
name
has
for
anyone
Bree
said
Frodo
angrily
and
have
still
learn
why
interests
you
Strider
may
have
honest
reason
for
spying
and
eavesdropping
but
should
advise
him
explain
Well
answered
said
Strider
laughing
But
the
explanation
simple
was
looking
for
Hobbit
called
Frodo
Baggins
wanted
find
him
quickly
had
learned
that
was
carrying
out
the
Shire
well
secret
that
concerned
and
friends
Now
don
mistake
cried
Frodo
rose
from
his
seat
and
Sam
jumped
with
scowl
shall
take
more
care
the
secret
than
you
And
care
needed
leaned
forward
and
looked
them
Watch
every
shadow
said
low
voice
Black
horse
men
have
passed
through
Bree
Monday
one
came
down
the
Greenway
they
say
and
another
appeared
later
coming
the
Greenway
from
the
south
There
was
silence
last
Frodo
spoke
Pippin
and
Sam
ought
have
guessed
from
the
way
the
gatekeeper
greeted
said
And
the
landlord
seems
have
heard
something
Why
did
press
join
the
company
And
why
earth
did
behave
foolishly
ought
have
stayed
quiet
here
would
have
been
better
said
Strider
would
have
stopped
your
going
into
the
common
room
could
but
the
innkeeper
would
not
let
see
you
take
message
you
think
began
Frodo
don
think
any
harm
old
Butterbur
Only
does
not
altogether
like
mysterious
vagabonds
sort
Frodo
gave
him
puzzled
look
Well
have
rather
rascally
look
have
not
said
Strider
with
curl
his
lip
and
queer
gleam
his
eye
But
hope
shall
get
know
one
another
better
When
hope
you
will
explain
what
happened
the
end
your
song
For
that
little
prank
was
sheer
accident
interrupted
Frodo
wonder
said
Strider
Accident
then
That
accident
has
made
your
position
dangerous
Hardly
more
than
was
already
said
Frodo
knew
these
horse
men
were
pursuing
but
now
any
rate
they
seem
have
missed
and
have
gone
away
STRIDER
165
You
must
not
count
that
said
Strider
sharply
They
will
return
And
more
are
coming
There
are
others
know
their
number
know
these
Riders
paused
and
his
eyes
were
cold
and
hard
And
there
are
some
folk
Bree
who
are
not
trusted
went
Bill
Ferny
for
instance
has
evil
name
the
Bree
land
and
queer
folk
call
his
house
You
must
have
noticed
him
among
the
company
swarthy
sneering
fellow
was
very
close
with
one
the
Southern
strangers
and
they
slipped
out
together
just
after
your
accident
Not
all
those
Southerners
mean
well
and
for
Ferny
would
sell
anything
anybody
make
mischief
for
amusement
What
will
Ferny
sell
and
what
has
accident
got
with
him
said
Frodo
still
determined
not
understand
Strider
hints
News
you
course
answered
Strider
account
your
performance
would
very
interesting
certain
people
After
that
they
would
hardly
need
told
your
real
name
seems
only
too
likely
that
they
will
hear
before
this
night
over
that
enough
You
can
you
like
about
reward
take
guide
not
But
may
say
that
know
all
the
lands
between
the
Shire
and
the
Misty
Mountains
for
have
wandered
over
them
for
many
years
older
than
look
might
prove
useful
You
will
have
leave
the
open
road
after
tonight
for
the
horsemen
will
watch
night
and
day
You
may
escape
from
Bree
and
allowed
forward
while
the
Sun
but
you
won
far
They
will
come
you
the
wild
some
dark
place
where
there
help
you
wish
them
find
you
They
are
terrible
The
hobbits
looked
him
and
saw
with
surprise
that
his
face
was
drawn
with
pain
and
his
hands
clenched
the
arms
his
chair
The
room
was
very
quiet
and
still
and
the
light
seemed
have
grown
dim
For
while
sat
with
unseeing
eyes
walking
distant
memory
listening
sounds
the
Night
far
away
There
cried
after
moment
drawing
his
hand
across
his
brow
Perhaps
know
more
about
these
pursuers
than
you
You
fear
them
but
you
not
fear
them
enough
yet
Tomorrow
you
will
have
escape
you
can
Strider
can
take
you
paths
that
are
seldom
trodden
Will
you
have
him
There
was
heavy
silence
Frodo
made
answer
his
mind
was
confused
with
doubt
and
fear
Sam
frowned
and
looked
his
master
and
last
broke
out
With
your
leave
Frodo
say
This
Strider
here
warns
and
says
take
care
and
say
yes
that
and
let
begin
with
him
comes
out
the
Wild
and
never
heard
good
such
folk
knows
something
that
plain
and
more
than
like
166
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
but
reason
why
should
let
him
leading
out
into
some
dark
place
far
from
help
puts
Pippin
fidgeted
and
looked
uncomfortable
Strider
did
not
reply
Sam
but
turned
his
keen
eyes
Frodo
Frodo
caught
his
glance
and
looked
away
said
slowly
don
agree
think
think
you
are
not
really
you
choose
look
You
began
talk
like
the
Bree
folk
but
your
voice
has
changed
Still
Sam
seems
right
this
don
see
why
you
should
warn
take
care
and
yet
ask
take
you
trust
Why
the
disguise
Who
are
you
What
you
really
know
about
about
business
and
how
you
know
The
lesson
caution
has
been
well
learned
said
Strider
with
grim
smile
But
caution
one
thing
and
wavering
another
You
will
never
get
Rivendell
now
your
own
and
trust
your
only
chance
You
must
make
your
mind
will
answer
some
your
questions
that
will
help
you
But
why
should
you
believe
story
you
not
trust
already
Still
here
that
moment
there
came
knock
the
door
Butterbur
had
arrived
with
candles
and
behind
him
was
Nob
with
cans
hot
water
Strider
withdrew
into
dark
corner
come
bid
you
good
night
said
the
landlord
putting
the
candles
the
table
Nob
Take
the
water
the
rooms
came
and
shut
the
door
like
this
began
hesitating
and
looking
troubled
done
any
harm
sorry
indeed
But
one
thing
drives
out
another
you
admit
and
busy
man
But
first
one
thing
and
then
another
this
week
have
jogged
memory
the
saying
goes
and
not
too
late
hope
You
see
was
asked
look
out
for
hobbits
the
Shire
and
for
one
the
name
Baggins
particular
And
what
has
that
got
with
asked
Frodo
you
know
best
said
the
landlord
knowingly
won
give
you
away
but
was
told
that
this
Baggins
would
going
the
name
Underhill
and
was
given
description
that
fits
you
well
enough
may
say
Indeed
Let
have
then
said
Frodo
unwisely
interrupting
stout
little
fellow
with
red
cheeks
said
Butterbur
solemnly
Pippin
chuckled
but
Sam
looked
indignant
That
won
help
you
much
goes
for
most
hobbits
Barley

continued
Butterbur
with
glance
Pippin
But
this
one
taller
than

and
fairer
than
most
and
has
cleft
his
chin
perky
chap
with
bright
eye
Begging
your
pardon
but

And
who

asked
Frodo
eagerly
STRIDER

That

But
now

sour
into
block
wood
shouldn
wonder
bit
hasty
Still
what
done
can

Well
what
have
you
done
said
Frodo
getting
impatient
with
the
slow
unravelling
Butterbur
thoughts
Where
was
said
the
landlord
pausing
and
snapping
his
fingers
yes
Old
Gandalf
Three

says
and
then
gave
letter

Butterbur
producing
letter
from
his
pocket
and
reading

and
proudly

man

Gandalf
cried
Frodo
said
Butterbur
Then

Frodo
and
you
had
better
give
that
letter
once
and
explain
why
you
never

That
what

came
tell
suppose
though
you
taken
long
time

Poor
Butterbur
looked
troubled
You

master
said
and
beg
your
pardon
And
mortal
afraid
what
Gandalf
will
say
harm

But
didn
keep

put
safe
Then
couldn
find
nobody
willing

The
landlord
jumped
with
surprise
You

You

What

said
Frodo
came
offer
his
help
Well

said
Butterbur
looking
suspiciously
Strider
But

Ranger
Then
who
would
you
take
with
asked
Strider
fat
innkeeper
who
only
remembers
his
own
name
because
people
shout
him
all
day
They
cannot
stay
The
Pony
for

and
they

They

Will

Butterbur
looking
really
scared
But
why

for
bit
Underhill
What

queer
goings
What

Frodo
tired

But

These

Strider
low
voice
From

cried
Butterbur
turning
pale
the

evidently
was
known
him
That
the
worst
news
that
has
come
Bree

said
Frodo
Are

said
Butterbur
More
than

Though

Against

Strider
quietly
Not

STRIDER

Underhill

that
said
Butterbur
But
they
find
out
here
without
help
from
afraid
pity
Baggins
drew
attention
himself
this
evening
say
more
The
story
that
Bilbo
going
off
has
been
heard
before
tonight
Bree
Even
our
Nob
has
been
doing
some
guessing
his
slow

and
there

others
Bree
quicker
the
uptake
than
Well

Frodo
hope

said
Butterbur
But
spooks

Don

Good

Where

said
Frodo
with
sudden
anxiety
They
had
forgot
ten
all
about
Merry
and
was
getting
late
afraid
out
said
something
about
going
for
breath
air
Well

Butterbur

Good

Butterbur
went
out
with
another
doubtful
look
Strider
and
shake
his
head
His
footsteps
retreated
down
the
passage
Well
said
Strider
When
are
you
going
open
that
letter
Frodo
looked
carefully
the
seal
before
broke
seemed
cer
tainly
Gandalf
Inside
written
the
wizard
strong
but
graceful
script
was
the
following
message

His

All

Not

Butterbur
sends
this
promptly
worthy
man
but
his
memory
like
lumber
room
thing
wanted
always
buried
forgets
shall
roast

Fare
Well
Frodo
read
the
letter
himself
and
then
passed
Pippin
and
Sam
Really
old
Butterbur
has
made
mess
things
said
deserves
roasting
had
got
this
once
might
all
have
been
safe
Rivendell
now
But
what
can
have
happened
Gandalf
writes
was
going
into
great
danger
has
been
doing
that
for
many
years
said
Strider
Frodo
turned
and
looked
him
thoughtfully
wondering
about
Gandalf
second
postscript
Why
didn
you
tell
that
you
were
Gandalf
friend
once
asked
would
have
saved
time
Would
Would
any
you
have
believed
till
now
said
Strider
knew
nothing
this
letter
For
all
knew
had
persuade
you
trust
without
proofs
was
help
you
any
case
did
not
intend
tell
you
all
about
myself
once
had
study
you
first
and
make
sure
you
The
Enemy
has
set
traps
for
before
now
soon
had
made
mind
was
ready
tell
you
whatever
you
asked
But
must
admit
added
with
queer
laugh
that
hoped
you
would
take
for
own
sake
hunted
man
sometimes
wearies
distrust
and
longs
for
friendship
But
there
believe
looks
are
against
They
are
first
sight
any
rate
laughed
Pippin
with
sudden
STRIDER
I7I
relief
after
reading
Gandalf
letter
But
handsome
handsome
does
say
the
Shire
and
daresay
shall
all
look
much
the
same
after
lying
for
days
hedges
and
ditches
would
take
more
than
few
days
weeks
years
wander
ing
the
Wild
make
you
look
like
Strider
answered
And
you
would
die
first
unless
you
are
made
sterner
stuff
than
you
look
Pippin
subsided
but
Sam
was
not
daunted
and
still
eyed
Strider
dubiously
How
know
you
are
the
Strider
that
Gandalf
speaks
about
demanded
You
never
mentioned
Gandalf
till
this
letter
came
out
You
might
play
acting
spy
for
all
can
see
trying
get
with
you
You
might
have
done
the
real
Strider
and
took
his
clothes
What
have
you
say
that
That
you
are
stout
fellow
answered
Strider
but
afraid
only
answer
you
Sam
Gamgee
this
had
killed
the
real
Strider
could
kill
you
And
should
have
killed
you
already
without
much
talk
was
after
the
Ring
could
have
Now
stood
and
seemed
suddenly
grow
taller
his
eyes
gleamed
light
keen
and
commanding
Throwing
back
his
cloak
laid
his
hand
the
hilt
sword
that
had
hung
concealed
his
side
They
did
not
dare
move
Sam
sat
wide
mouthed
staring
him
dumbly
But
the
real
Strider
fortunately
said
looking
down
them
with
his
face
softened
sudden
smile
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
and
life
death
can
save
you
will
There
was
long
silence
last
Frodo
spoke
with
hesitation
believed
that
you
were
friend
before
the
letter
came
said
least
wished
You
have
frightened
several
times
tonight
but
never
the
way
that
servants
the
Enemy
would
imagine
think
one
his
spies
would
well
seem
fairer
and
feel
fouler
you
understand
see
laughed
Strider
look
foul
and
feel
fair
that
that
gold
does
not
glitter
not
all
those
who
wander
are
lost
Did
the
verses
apply
you
then
asked
Frodo
could
not
make
out
what
they
were
about
But
how
did
you
know
that
they
were
Gandalf
letter
you
have
never
seen
did
not
know
answered
But
Iam
Aragorn
and
those
verses
with
that
name
drew
out
his
sword
and
they
saw
that
the
blade
was
indeed
broken
foot
below
the
hilt
Not
much
use
Sam
said
Strider
But
the
time
near
when
shall
forged
anew
Sam
said
nothing
Well
said
Strider
with
Sam
permission
will
call
that
settled
172
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Strider
shall
your
guide
And
now
think
time
you
went
bed
and
took
what
rest
you
can
shall
have
rough
road
morrow
Even
are
allowed
leave
Bree
unhindered
can
hardly
hope
now
leave
unnoticed
But
shall
try
get
lost
soon
possible
know
one
two
ways
out
Bree
land
other
than
the
main
road
once
shake
off
the
pursuit
shall
make
for
Weathertop
Weathertop
said
Sam
What
that
hill
just
the
north
the
Road
about
half
way
from
here
Rivendell
commands
wide
view
all
round
and
there
shall
have
chance
look
about
Gandalf
will
make
for
that
point
follows
After
Weathertop
our
journey
will
become
more
difficult
and
shall
have
choose
between
various
dangers
When
did
you
last
see
Gandalf
asked
Frodo
you
know
where
what
doing
Strider
looked
grave
not
know
said
came
west
with
him
the
spring
have
often
kept
watch
the
borders
the
Shire
the
last
few
years
when
was
busy
elsewhere
seldom
left
unguarded
last
met
the
first
May
Sarn
Ford
down
the
Brandywine
told
that
his
business
with
you
had
gone
well
and
that
you
would
starting
for
Rivendell
the
last
week
September
knew
was
your
side
went
away
journey
own
And
that
has
proved
ill
for
plainly
some
news
reached
him
and
was
not
hand
help
troubled
for
the
first
time
since
have
known
him
should
have
had
messages
even
could
not
come
himself
When
returned
many
days
ago
heard
the
ill
news
The
tidings
had
gone
far
and
wide
that
Gandalf
was
missing
and
the
horsemen
had
been
seen
was
the
Elven
folk
Gildor
that
told
this
and
later
they
told
that
you
had
left
your
home
but
there
was
news
your
leaving
Buckland
have
been
watching
the
East
Road
anxiously
you
think
the
Black
Riders
have
anything
with
with
Gandalf
absence
mean
asked
Frodo
not
know
anything
else
that
could
have
hindered
him
except
the
Enemy
himself
said
Strider
But
not
give
hope
Gandalf
greater
than
you
Shire
folk
know
rule
you
can
only
see
his
jokes
and
toys
But
this
business
ours
will
his
greatest
task
Pippin
yawned
sorry
said
but
dead
tired
spite
all
the
danger
and
worry
must
bed
sleep
where
sit
Where
that
silly
fellow
Merry
would
the
last
straw
had
out
the
dark
look
for
him
STRIDER
173
that
moment
they
heard
door
slam
then
feet
came
running
along
the
passage
Merry
came
with
rush
followed
Nob
shut
the
door
hastily
and
leaned
against
was
out
breath
They
stared
him
alarm
for
moment
before
gasped
have
seen
them
Frodo
have
seen
them
Black
Riders
Black
Riders
cried
Frodo
Where
Here
the
village
stayed
indoors
for
hour
Then
you
did
not
come
back
went
out
for
stroll
had
come
back
again
and
was
standing
just
outside
the
light
the
lamp
looking
the
stars
Suddenly
shivered
and
felt
that
something
horrible
was
creep
ing
near
there
was
sort
deeper
shade
among
the
shadows
across
the
road
just
beyond
the
edge
the
lamplight
slid
away
once
into
the
dark
without
sound
There
was
horse
Which
way
did
asked
Strider
suddenly
and
sharply
Merry
started
noticing
the
stranger
for
the
first
time
onl
said
Frodo
This
friend
Gandalf
will
explain
later
seemed
make
off
the
Road
eastward
continued
Merry
tried
follow
course
vanished
almost
once
but
went
round
the
corner
and
far
the
last
house
the
Road
Strider
looked
Merry
with
wonder
You
have
stout
heart
said
but
was
foolish
don
know
said
Merry
Neither
brave
nor
silly
think
could
hardly
help
myself
seemed
drawn
somehow
Anyway
went
and
suddenly
heard
voices
the
hedge
One
was
muttering
and
the
other
was
whispering
hissing
couldn
hear
word
that
was
said
did
not
creep
any
closer
because
began
tremble
all
over
Then
felt
terrified
and
turned
back
and
was
just
going
bolt
home
when
something
came
behind
and
fell
over
found
him
sir
put
Nob
Butterbur
sent
out
with
lantern
went
down
West
gate
and
then
back
towards
South
gate
Just
nigh
Bill
Ferny
house
thought
could
see
some
thing
the
Road
couldn
swear
but
looked
two
men
was
stooping
over
something
lifting
gave
shout
but
when
got
the
spot
there
was
signs
them
and
only
Brandybuck
lying
the
roadside
seemed
asleep
thought
Thad
fallen
into
deep
water
says
when
shook
him
Very
queer
was
and
soon
had
roused
him
got
and
ran
back
here
like
hare
afraid
that
true
said
Merry
though
don
know
what
said
had
ugly
dream
which
can
remember
went
pieces
don
know
what
came
over
said
Strider
The
Black
Breath
The
Riders
must
have
left
their
horses
outside
and
passed
back
through
the
South
gate
secret
They
will
know
all
the
news
now
for
they
have
visited
Bill
174
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Ferny
and
probably
that
Southerner
was
spy
well
Something
may
happen
the
night
before
leave
Bree
What
will
happen
said
Merry
Will
they
attack
the
inn
think
not
said
Strider
They
are
not
all
here
yet
And
any
case
that
not
their
way
dark
and
loneliness
they
are
strong
est
they
will
not
openly
attack
house
where
there
are
lights
and
many
people
not
until
they
are
desperate
not
while
all
the
long
leagues
Eriador
still
lie
before
But
their
power
terror
and
already
some
Bree
are
their
clutch
They
will
drive
these
wretches
some
evil
work
Ferny
and
some
the
strangers
and
maybe
the
gatekeeper
too
They
had
words
with
Harry
West
gate
Monday
was
watching
them
was
white
and
shaking
when
they
left
him
seem
have
enemies
all
round
said
Frodo
What
are
Stay
here
and
not
your
rooms
They
are
sure
have
found
out
which
those
are
The
hobbit
rooms
have
windows
looking
north
and
close
the
ground
will
all
remain
together
and
bar
this
window
and
the
door
But
first
Nob
and
will
fetch
your
luggage
While
Strider
was
gone
Frodo
gave
Merry
rapid
account
all
that
had
happened
since
supper
Merry
was
still
reading
and
pondering
Gandalf
letter
when
Strider
and
Nob
returned
Well
Masters
said
Nob
ruffled
the
clothes
and
put
bolster
down
the
middle
each
bed
And
made
nice
imitation
your
head
with
brown
woollen
mat
Bag
Underhill
sir
added
with
grin
Pippin
laughed
Very
life
like
said
But
what
will
happen
when
they
have
penetrated
the
disguise
shall
see
said
Strider
Let
hope
hold
the
fort
till
morning
Good
night
you
said
Nob
and
went
off
take
his
part
the
watch
the
doors
Their
bags
and
gear
they
piled
the
parlour
floor
They
pushed
low
chair
against
the
door
and
shut
the
window
Peering
out
Frodo
saw
that
the
night
was
still
clear
The
Sickle
was
swinging
bright
above
the
shoulders
Bree
hill
then
closed
and
barred
the
heavy
inside
shutters
and
drew
the
curtains
together
Strider
built
the
fire
and
blew
out
all
the
candles
The
hobbits
lay
down
their
blankets
with
their
feet
towards
the
hearth
but
Strider
settled
himself
the
chair
against
the
door
They
talked
for
little
for
Merry
still
had
several
questions
ask
Jumped
over
the
Moon
chuckled
Merry
rolled
himself
The
Hobbits
name
for
the
Plough
Great
Bear
STRIDER

his
blanket
Very
ridiculous
you
Frodo
But
wish
had
been
there
see
The
worthies
Bree
will
discussing
hundred
years
hence
hope
said
Strider
Then
they
all
fell
silent
and
one
one
the
hobbits
dropped
off
sleep
Chapter
KNIFE
THE
DARK
they
prepared
for
sleep
the
inn
Bree
darkness
lay
Buck
land
mist
strayed
the
dells
and
along
the
river
bank
The
house
Crickhollow
stood
silent
Fatty
Bolger
opened
the
door
cautiously
and
peered
out
feeling
fear
had
been
growing
him
all
day
and
was
unable
rest
bed
there
was
brooding
threat
the
breathless
night
air
stared
out
into
the
gloom
black
shadow
moved
under
the
trees
the
gate
seemed
open
its
own
accord
and
close
again
without
sound
Terror
seized
him
shrank
back
and
for
moment
stood
trembling
the
hall
Then
shut
and
locked
the
door
The
night
deepened
There
came
the
soft
sound
horses
led
with
stealth
along
the
lane
Outside
the
gate
they
stopped
and
three
black
figures
entered
like
shades
night
creeping
across
the
ground
One
went
the
door
one
the
corner
the
house
either
side
and
there
they
stood
still
the
shadows
stones
while
night
went
slowly
The
house
and
the
quiet
trees
seemed
waiting
breathlessly
There
was
faint
stir
the
leaves
and
cock
crowed
far
away
The
cold
hour
before
dawn
was
passing
The
figure
the
door
moved
the
dark
without
moon
stars
drawn
blade
gleamed
chill
light
had
been
unsheathed
There
was
blow
soft
but
heavy
and
the
door
shuddered
Open
the
name
Mordor
said
voice
thin
and
menacing
second
blow
the
door
yielded
and
fell
back
with
timbers
burst
and
lock
broken
The
black
figures
passed
swiftly
that
moment
among
the
trees
nearby
horn
rang
out
rent
the
night
like
fire
hill
top
AWAKE
FEAR
FIRE
FOES
AWAKE
Fatty
Bolger
had
not
been
idle
soon
saw
the
dark
shapes
creep
from
the
garden
knew
that
must
run
for
perish
And
run
did
out
the
back
door
through
the
garden
and
over
the
fields
When
reached
the
nearest
house
more
than
mile
away
collapsed
the
doorstep
was
crying
not
haven
got
was
some
time
before
anyone
could
make
out
what
was
babbling
about
last
they
got
the
idea
that
enemies
KNIFE
THE
DARK
177
were
Buckland
some
strange
invasion
from
the
Old
Forest
And
then
they
lost
more
time
FEAR
FIRE
FOES
The
Brandybucks
were
blowing
the
Horn
call
Buckland
that
had
not
been
sounded
for
hundred
years
not
since
the
white
wolves
came
the
Fell
Winter
when
the
Brandywine
was
frozen
over
AWAKE
AWAKE
Far
away
answering
horns
were
heard
The
alarm
was
spreading
The
black
figures
fled
from
the
house
One
them
let
fall
hobbit
cloak
the
step
ran
the
lane
the
noise
hoofs
broke
out
and
gathering
gallop
went
hammering
away
into
the
darkness
All
about
Crickhollow
there
was
the
sound
horns
blow
ing
and
voices
crying
and
feet
running
But
the
Black
Riders
rode
like
gale
the
North
gate
Let
the
little
people
blow
Sauron
would
deal
with
them
later
Meanwhile
they
had
another
errand
they
knew
now
that
the
house
was
empty
and
the
Ring
had
gone
They
rode
down
the
guards
the
gate
and
vanished
from
the
Shire
the
early
night
Frodo
woke
from
deep
sleep
suddenly
some
sound
presence
had
disturbed
him
saw
that
Strider
was
sitting
alert
his
chair
his
eyes
gleamed
the
light
the
fire
which
had
been
tended
and
was
burning
brightly
but
made
sign
movement
Frodo
soon
went
sleep
again
but
his
dreams
were
again
troubled
with
the
noise
wind
and
galloping
hoofs
The
wind
seemed
curling
round
the
house
and
shaking
and
far
off
heard
horn
blowing
wildly
opened
his
eyes
and
heard
cock
crowing
lustily
the
inn
yard
Strider
had
drawn
the
curtains
and
pushed
back
the
shutters
with
clang
The
first
grey
light
day
was
the
room
and
cold
air
was
coming
through
the
open
window
soon
Strider
had
roused
them
all
led
the
way
their
bedrooms
When
they
saw
them
they
were
glad
that
they
had
taken
his
advice
the
windows
had
been
forced
open
and
were
swinging
and
the
curtains
were
flapping
the
beds
were
tossed
about
and
the
bolsters
slashed
and
flung
upon
the
floor
the
brown
mat
was
torn
pieces
Strider
immediately
went
fetch
the
landlord
Poor
Butterbur
looked
sleepy
and
frightened
had
hardly
closed
his
eyes
all
night
said
but
had
never
heard
sound
178
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Never
has
such
thing
happened
time
cried
raising
his
hands
horror
Guests
unable
sleep
their
beds
and
good
bolsters
ruined
and
all
What
are
coming
Dark
times
said
Strider
But
for
the
present
you
may
left
peace
when
you
have
got
rid
will
leave
once
Never
mind
about
breakfast
drink
and
bite
standing
will
have
shall
packed
few
minutes
Butterbur
hurried
off
see
that
their
ponies
were
got
ready
and
fetch
them
bite
But
very
soon
came
back
dismay
The
ponies
had
vanished
The
stable
doors
had
all
been
opened
the
night
and
they
were
gone
not
only
Merry
ponies
but
every
other
horse
and
beast
the
place
Frodo
was
crushed
the
news
How
could
they
hope
reach
Rivendell
foot
pursued
mounted
enemies
They
might
well
set
out
for
the
Moon
Strider
sat
silent
for
while
looking
the
hobbits
was
weighing
their
strength
and
courage
Ponies
would
not
help
escape

said
last
thoughtfully
guessed
what
Frodo
had
mind
should
not

slower

going
walk

case
the
food
and

and
Rivendell
except
what

ought
take

delayed
forced
round
about
far
out
the
direct
way
How
much
are
you
prepared
carry
your
backs
much
must
said
Pippin
with
sinking
heart
but
trying
show
that
was
tougher
than
looked
felt
can
carry
enough
for
two
said
Sam
defiantly
Can
anything
done
Butterbur
asked
Frodo
Can
get
couple
ponies
the
village
even
one
just
for
the
baggage
don
suppose
could
hire
them
but
might
able
buy
them
added
doubtfully
wondering
could
afford
doubt
said
the
landlord
unhappily
The
two
three
riding
ponies
that
there
were
Bree
were
stabled
yard
and
they
gone
for
other
animals
horses
ponies
for
draught
what
not
there
are
very
few
them
Bree
and
they
won
for
sale
But
what
can
Pll
rout
out
Bob
and
send
him
round
soon
may
Yes
said
Strider
reluctantly
you
had
better
that
afraid
shall
have
try
get
one
pony
least
But
ends
all
hope
starting
early
and
slipping
away
quietly
might
well
have
blown
horn
announce
our
departure
That
was
part
their
plan
doubt
There
one
crumb
comfort
said
Merry
and
more
than
KNIFE
THE
DARK
179
crumb
hope
can
have
breakfast
while
wait
and
sit
down
Let
get
hold
Nob
the
end
there
was
more
than
three
hours
delay
Bob
came
back
with
the
report
that
horse
pony
was
got
for
love
money
the
neighbourhood
except
one
Bill
Ferny
had
one
that
might
possibly
sell
poor
old
half
starved
creature
said
Bob
but
won
part
with
for
less
than
thrice
its
worth
seeing
how
you
placed
not
knows
Bill
Ferny
Bill
Ferny
said
Frodo
Isn
there
some
trick
Wouldn
the
beast
bolt
back
him
with
all
our
stuff
help
tracking
something
wonder
said
Strider
But
cannot
imagine
any
animal
running
home
him
once
got
away
fancy
this
only
afterthought
kind
Master
Ferny
just
way
increasing
his
profits
from
the
affair
The
chief
danger
that
the
poor
beast
probably
death
door
But
there
does
not
seem
any
choice
What
does
want
for
Bill
Ferny
price
was
twelve
silver
pennies
and
that
was
indeed
least
three
times
the
pony
value
those
parts
proved
bony
underfed
and
dispirited
animal
but
did
not
look
like
dying
just
yet
Butterbur
paid
for
himself
and
offered
Merry
another
eighteen
pence
some
compensation
for
the
lost
animals
was
honest
man
and
well
off
things
were
reckoned
Bree
but
thirty
silver
pennies
was
sore
blow
him
and
being
cheated
Bill
Ferny
made
harder
bear
matter
fact
came
out
the
right
side
the
end
turned
out
later
that
only
one
horse
had
been
actually
stolen
The
others
had
been
driven
off
had
bolted
terror
and
were
found
wandering
different
corners
the
Bree
land
Merry
ponies
had
escaped
altogether
and
eventually
having
good
deal
sense
they
made
their
way
the
Downs
search
Fatty
Lumpkin
they
came
under
the
care
Tom
Bombadil
for
while
and
were
well
off
But
when
news
the
events
Bree
came
Tom
ears
sent
them
Butterbur
who
thus
got
five
good
beasts
very
fair
price
They
had
work
harder
Bree
but
Bob
treated
them
well
the
whole
they
were
lucky
they
missed
dark
and
dangerous
journey
But
they
never
came
Rivendell
However
the
meanwhile
for
all
Butterbur
knew
his
money
was
gone
for
good
for
bad
And
had
other
troubles
For
there
was
great
commotion
soon
the
remaining
guests
were
astir
and
heard
news
the
raid
the
inn
The
southern
travellers
had
lost
several
horses
and
blamed
the
innkeeper
loudly
until
became
known
that
one
their
own
number
had
also
disappeared
the
180
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
night
none
other
than
Bill
Ferny
squint
eyed
companion
Suspicion
fell
him
once
you
pick
with
horse
thief
and
bring
him
house
said
Butterbur
angrily
you
ought
pay
for
all
the
damage
yourselves
and
not
come
shouting
and
ask
Ferny
where
your
hand
some
friend
But
appeared
that
was
nobody
friend
and
nobody
could
recollect
when
had
joined
their
party
After
their
breakfast
the
hobbits
had
pack
and
get
together
further
supplies
for
the
longer
journey
they
were
now
expecting
was
close
ten
clock
before
they
last
got
off
that
time
the
whole
Bree
was
buzzing
with
excitement
Frodo
vanishing
trick
the
appearance
the
black
horsemen
the
robbing
the
stables
and
not
least
the
news
that
Strider
the
Ranger
had
joined
the
mysterious
hobbits
made
such
tale
would
last
for
many
uneventful
years
Most
the
inhabitants
Bree
and
Staddle
and
many
even
from
Combe
and
Archet
were
crowded
the
road
see
the
travellers
start
The
other
guests
the
inn
were
the
doors
hanging
out
the
windows
Strider
had
changed
his
mind
and
had
decided
leave
Bree
the
main
road
Any
attempt
set
off
across
country
once
would
only
make
matters
worse
half
the
inhabitants
would
follow
them
see
what
they
were
and
prevent
them
from
trespassing
They
said
farewell
Nob
and
Bob
and
took
leave
Butterbur
with
many
thanks
hope
shall
meet
again
some
day
when
things
are
merry
once
more
said
Frodo
should
like
nothing
better
than
stay
your
house
peace
for
while
They
tramped
off
anxious
and
downhearted
under
the
eyes
the
crowd
Not
all
the
faces
were
friendly
nor
all
the
words
that
were
shouted
But
Strider
seemed
held
awe
most
the
Bree
landers
and
those
that
stared
shut
their
mouths
and
drew
away
walked
front
with
Frodo
next
came
Merry
and
Pippin
and
last
came
Sam
leading
the
pony
which
was
laden
with
much
their
baggage
they
had
the
heart
give
but
already
looked
less
dejected
approved
the
change
its
fortunes
Sam
was
chewing
apple
thoughtfully
had
pocket
full
them
parting
present
from
Nob
and
Bob
Apples
for
walking
and
pipe
for
sitting
said
But
reckon
Ill
miss
them
both
before
long
The
hobbits
took
notice
the
inquisitive
heads
that
peeped
out
doors
popped
over
walls
and
fences
they
passed
But
they
drew
near
the
further
gate
Frodo
saw
dark
ill
kept
house
behind
thick
hedge
the
last
house
the
village
one
the
windows
caught
glimpse
sallow
face
with
sly
slanting
eyes
but
vanished
once
KNIFE
THE
DARK
I8I
that
where
that
southerner
hiding
thought
looks
more
than
half
like
goblin
Over
the
hedge
another
man
was
staring
boldly
had
heavy
black
brows
and
dark
scornful
eyes
his
large
mouth
curled
sneer
was
smoking
short
black
pipe
they
approached
took
out
his
mouth
and
spat
Morning
Longshanks
said
Off
early
Found
some
friends
last
Strider
nodded
but
did
not
answer
Morning
little
friends
said
the
others
suppose
you
know
who
you
taken
with
That
Stick
naught
Strider
that
Though
heard
other
names
not
pretty
Watch
out
tonight
And
you
Sammie
don
ill
treating
poor
old
pony
Pah
spat
again
Sam
turned
quickly
And
you
Ferny
said
put
your
ugly
face
out
sight
will
get
hurt
With
sudden
flick
quick
lightning
apple
left
his
hand
and
hit
Bill
square
the
nose
ducked
too
late
and
curses
came
from
behind
the
hedge
Waste
good
apple
said
Sam
regretfully
and
strode
last
they
left
the
village
behind
The
escort
children
and
stragglers
that
had
followed
them
got
tired
and
turned
back
the
South
gate
Passing
through
they
kept
along
the
Road
for
some
miles
bent
the
left
curving
back
into
its
eastward
line
rounded
the
feet
Bree
hill
and
then
began
run
swiftly
down
wards
into
wooded
country
their
left
they
could
see
some
the
houses
and
hobbit
holes
Staddle
the
gentler
south
eastern
slopes
the
hill
down
deep
hollow
away
north
the
Road
there
were
wisps
rising
smoke
that
showed
where
Combe
lay
Archet
was
hidden
the
trees
beyond
After
the
Road
had
run
down
some
way
and
had
left
Bree
hill
standing
tall
and
brown
behind
they
came
narrow
track
that
led
off
towards
the
North
This
where
leave
the
open
and
take
cover
said
Strider
Not
short
cut
hope
said
Pippin
Our
last
short
cut
through
woods
nearly
ended
disaster
but
you
had
not
got
with
you
then
laughed
Strider
cuts
short
long
don
wrong
took
look
and
down
the
Road
one
was
sight
and
led
the
way
quickly
down
towards
the
wooded
valley
His
plan
far
they
could
understand
without
knowing
the
country
was
towards
Archet
first
but
bear
right
and
pass
the
east
and
then
steer
straight
could
over
the
wild
lands
Weathertop
Hill
that
way
they
would
all
went
well
cut
off
great
loop
the
Road
which

bent
southwards

themselves
and
Strider
description
them
was
not
encouraging
However
the
meanwhile
walking
was
not
unpleasant
Indeed
had
not
been
for
the
disturbing
events
the
night
before
they
would
have
enjoyed
this
part
the
journey
better
than
any
that
time
The
sun
was
shining
clear
but
not
too
hot
The
woods
the
valley
were
still
leafy
and
full
colour
and
seemed
peaceful
and
wholesome
Strider
guided
them
confidently
among
the
many
crossing
paths
although
left
themselves
they
would
soon
have
been

what

they

Whether

for
some

they
saw

any
other
living
thing
all
that
day
neither
two
footed
except
birds
nor
four
footed
except
one
fox
and
few
squirrels
The
next
day
they
began
steer
steady
course
eastwards
and
still
all
was
quiet
and
peaceful
the
third
day
out
from
Bree
they
came
out
the
Chetwood
The
land
had
been
falling
steadily
ever
since
they
turned
aside
from
the
Road
and
they
now
entered
wide
flat
expanse
country
much
more
difficult
man
age
They
were
far
beyond
the
borders
the
Bree
land
out
the
pathless
wilderness
and
drawing
near
the
Midgewater
Marshes
The
ground
now
became
damp
and
places
boggy
and
here
and
there
they
came
upon
pools
and
wide
stretches
reeds
and
rushes
filled
with
the
warbling
little
hidden
birds
They
had
pick
their
way
carefully
keep
both
dry
footed
and
their
proper
course
first
they
made
fair
progress
but
they
went
their
passage
became
slower
and
more
dangerous
The
marshes
were
bewildering
and
treacherous
and
there
was
permanent
trail
even
for
Rangers
find
through
their
shifting
quagmires
The
flies
began
torment
them
and
the
air
was
full
clouds
tiny
midges
that
crept
their
sleeves
and
breeches
and
into
their
hair
being
eaten
alive
cried
Pippin
Midgewater
There
are
more
midges
than
water
What
they
live
when
they
can
get

asked
Sam
scratching
his
neck
They
spent
miserable
day
this
lonely
and
unpleasant
country
KNIFE
THE
DARK
183
Their
camping
place
was
damp
cold
and
uncomfortable
and
the
biting
insects
would
not
let
them
sleep
There
were
also
abominable
creatures
haunting
the
reeds
and
tussocks
that
from
the
sound
them
were
evil
relatives
the
cricket
There
were
thousands
them
and
they
squeaked
all
round
neek
breek
breek
neek
unceasingly
all
the
night
until
the
hobbits
were
nearly
frantic
The
next
day
the
fourth
was
little
better
and
the
night
almost
comfortless
Though
the
Neekerbreekers
Sam
called
them
had
been
left
behind
the
midges
still
pursued
them
Frodo
lay
tired
but
unable
close
his
eyes
seemed
him
that
far
away
there
came
light
the
eastern
sky
flashed
and
faded
many
times
was
not
the
dawn
for
that
was
still
some
hours
off
What
the
light
said
Strider
who
had
risen
and
was
standing
gazing
ahead
into
the
night
not
know
Strider
answered
too
distant
make
out
like
lightning
that
leaps
from
the
hill
tops
Frodo
lay
down
again
but
for
long
while
could
still
see
the
white
flashes
and
against
them
the
tall
dark
figure
Strider
standing
silent
and
watchful
last
passed
into
uneasy
sleep
They
had
not
gone
far
the
fifth
day
when
they
left
the
last
straggling
pools
and
reed
beds
the
marshes
behind
them
The
land
before
them
began
steadily
rise
again
Away
the
distance
east
ward
they
could
now
see
line
hills
The
highest
them
was
the
right
the
line
and
little
separated
from
the
others
had
conical
top
slightly
flattened
the
summit
That
Weathertop

Strider
The
Old

away

What

asked
Frodo

when

not
certain
what

find
close
the
Road
But
surely
were
hoping
find
Gandalf
there
Yes
but
the
hope
faint
comes
this
way
all
may
not
pass
through
Bree
and
may
not
know
what
are
doing
And
anyway
unless

Indeed
there
are
many

this

Not

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
The
hobbits
looked
anxiously
the
distant
hills
Sam
looked
into
the
pale
sky
fearing
see
hawks
eagles
hovering
over
them
with
bright
unfriendly
eyes
You
make
feel
uncomfortable
and
lonesome
Strider
said
What
you
advise
asked
Frodo
think
answered
Strider
slowly
was
not
quite
sure
think
the
best
thing
straight
eastward
from
here
can
make
for
the
line
hills
not
for
Weathertop
There
can
strike
path
know
that
runs
their
feet
will
bring
Weathertop
from
the
north
and
less
openly
Then
shall
see
what
shall
see
All
that
day
they
plodded
along
until
the
cold
and
early
evening
came
down
The
land
became
drier
and
more
barren
but
mists
and
vapours
lay
behind
them
the
marshes
few
melancholy
birds
were
piping
and
wailing
until
the
round
red
sun
sank
slowly
into
the
western
shadows
then
empty
silence
fell
The
hobbits
thought
the
soft
light
sunset
glancing
through
the
cheerful
windows
Bag
End
far
away
the
day
end
they
came
stream
that
wandered
down
from
the
hills
lose
itself
the
stagnant
marshland
and
they
went
along
its
banks
while
the
light
lasted
was
already
night
when
last
they
halted
and
made
their
camp
under
some
stunted
alder
trees
the
shores
the
stream
Ahead
there
loomed
now
against
the
dusky
sky
the
bleak
and
treeless
backs
the
hills
That
night
they
set
watch
and
Strider
seemed
did
not
sleep
all
The
moon
was
waxing
and
the
early
night
hours
cold
grey
light
lay
the
land
Next
morning
they
set
out
again
soon
after
sunrise
There
was
frost
the
air
and
the
sky
was
pale
clear
blue
The
hobbits
felt
refreshed
they
had
had
night
unbroken
sleep
Already
they
were
getting
used
much
walking
short
commons
shorter
any
rate
than
what
the
Shire
they
would
have
thought
barely
enough
keep
them
their
legs
Pippin
declared
that
Frodo
was
looking
twice
the
hobbit
that
had
been
Very
odd
said
Frodo
tightening
his
belt
considering
that
there
actually
good
deal
less
hope
the
thinning
process
will
not
indefinitely
shall
become
wraith
not
speak
such
things
said
Strider
quickly
and
with
sur
prising
earnestness
The
hills
drew
nearer
They
made
undulating
ridge
often
rising
almost
thousand
feet
and
here
and
there
falling
again
low
clefts
passes
leading
into
the
eastern
land
beyond
Along
the
crest
the
ridge
the
hobbits
could
see
what
looked
the
remains
green
grown
walls
and
dikes
and
the
clefts
there
still
stood

night
they
had
reached

the

and
there
they
camped
was
the
night
the
fifth
October
and
they
were
six
days
out
from
Bree
the
morning
they
found
for
the
first
time
since
they
had

They
turned

and
followed
southwards
ran
cunningly
taking

that
seemed

from
the
view
both
the

the

the

dived
into
dells

hugged
steep
banks
and
where
passed
over
flatter
and
more

ground
either
side
there
were
lines
large
boulders
and
hewn
stones
that
screened
the
travellers
almost
like

wonder
who
made
this
path
and
what
for
said
Merry
they
walked
along
one
these
avenues
where
the
stones
were
unusually
large
and
closely
set
not

There

Strider
The
Men
the
West
did
not
live
here
though
their
latter
days
they
defended
the
hills
for
while
against
the
evil
that
came
out
Angmar
This
path
was
made
serve
the
forts
along
the
walls
But
long
before
the
first
days
the
North
Kingdom
they
built
great
watch

Weathertop
Amon
Sil
they
called
was
burned
and
broken
and
nothing

now
but
tumbled

like
rough
crown
the
old

head
Yet
once
was
tall
and
fair
told
that
Elendil
stood
there
watching
for
the
coming
Gil
galad
out
the
West
the
days
the
Last
Alliance
The
hobbits
gazed
Strider
seemed
that
was
learned
old
lore
well
the
ways
the
wild
Who
was
Gil
galad
asked
Merry
but
Strider
did
not
answer
and
seemed
lost
thought
Suddenly
low
voice
murmured
Gil
galad
was
Elven
king
him
the
harpers
sadly
sing
the
last
whose
realm
was
fair
and
free
between
the

His

was
long
his
lance
was
keen
his
shining
helm
afar
was
seen

countless
stars

were
mirrored

silver
shield
But
long
ago

away
and
where

fell

Mordor

THE
LORD
THE

The
others
turned
amazement
for
the
voice
was
Sam
Don
stop
said
Merry
That
all
know
stammered
Sam
blushing
learned
from
Bilbo
when
was
lad
used
tell
tales
like
that
knowing
how
was
always
one
for
hearing
about
Elves
was
Bilbo
taught
letters
was
mighty
book

was
dear
old
Bilbo
And
wrote

wrote
what
have
just
said
did
not
make
said
Strider
part
the
lay
that
called
The
Fall
Gil
galad
which
ancient
tongue
Bilbo
must
have
translated
never
knew
that
There
was
lot
more
said
Sam
all
about
Mordor
didn
learn
that
part
gave
the
shivers
never
thought
should
going
that
way
myself
Going
Mordor
cried
Pippin
hope
won
come
that
not
speak
that
name
loudly
said
Strider
was
already
mid
day
when
they
drew
near
the
southern
end
the
path
and
saw
before
them
the
pale
clear
light
the
October
sun
grey
green
bank
leading
like
bridge
the
northward
slope
the
hill
They
decided
make
for
the
top
once
while
the
daylight
was
broad
Concealment
was
longer
possible
and
they
could
only
hope
that
enemy
spy
was
observing
them
Nothing
was
seen
moving
the
hill
Gandalf
was
anywhere
about
there
was
sign
him
the
western
flank
Weathertop
they
found
sheltered
hollow
the
bottom
which
there
was
bowl
shaped
dell
with
grassy
sides
There
they
left
Sam
and
Pippin
with
the
pony
and
their
packs
and
luggage
The
other
three
went
After
half
hour
plodding
climb
Strider
reached
the
crown
the
hill
Frodo
and
Merry
fol
lowed
tired
and
breathless
The
last
slope
had
been
steep
and
rocky
the
top
they
found
Strider
had
said
wide
ring
ancient
stone
work
now
crumbling
covered
with
age
long
grass
But
the
centre
cairn
broken
stones
had
been
piled
They
were
black
ened
with
fire
About
them
the
turf
was
burned
the
roots
and
all
within
the
ring
the
grass
was
scorched
and
shrivelled
flames
had
swept
the
hill
top
but
there
was
sign
any
living
thing
Standing
upon
the
rim
the
ruined
circle
they
saw
all
round
below
them
wide
prospect
for
the
most
part
lands
empty
and
featureless
except
for
patches
woodland
away
the
south
beyond
which
they
caught
here
and
there
the
glint
distant
water
Beneath
them
this
southern
side
there
ran
like
ribbon
the
Old
Road
coming
out
the
West
and
winding
and
down
until
faded
behind
ridge
dark
land
the
east
Nothing
was
moving
Following
its
line
eastward
with
their
eyes
they
saw
the
Mountains
KNIFE
THE
DARK
187
the
nearer
foothills
were
brown
and
sombre
behind
them
stood
taller
shapes
grey
and
behind
those
again
were
high
white
peaks
glim
mering
among
the
clouds
Well
here
are
said
Merry
And
very
cheerless
and
uninviting
looks
There
water
and
shelter
And
sign
Gandalf
But
don
blame
him
for
not
waiting
ever
came
here
wonder
said
Strider
looking
round
thoughtfully
Even
was
day
two
behind
Bree
could
have
arrived
here
first
can
ride
very
swiftly
when
need
presses
Suddenly
stooped
and
looked
the
stone
the
top
the
cairn
was
flatter
than
the
others
and
whiter
had
escaped
the
fire
picked
and
examined
turning
his
fingers
This
has
been
handled
recently
said
What
you
think
these
marks
the
flat
under
side
Frodo
saw
some
scratches
There
seems
stroke
dot
and
three
more
strokes
said
The
stroke
the
left
might
rune
with
thin
branches
said
Strider
might
sign
left
Gandalf
though
one
cannot
sure
The
scratches
are
fine
and
they
certainly
look
fresh
But
the
marks
might
mean
something
quite
different
and
have
nothing
with
Rangers
use
runes
and
they
come
here
sometimes
What
could
they
mean
even
Gandalf
made
them
asked
Merry
should
say
answered
Strider
that
they
stood
for
and
were
sign
that
Gandalf
was
here
October
the
third
that
three
days
ago
now
would
also
show
that
was
hurry
and
danger
was

that

did
not
dare
write
anything
longer
plainer
that
must
wary
wish
could
feel
sure
that
made
the
marks
whatever
they
may
mean
said
Frodo
would
great
comfort
know
that
was
the
way
front
behind
Perhaps
said
Strider
For
myself
believe
that
was
here
and
was
danger
There
have
been
scorching
flames
here
and
now
the
light
that
saw
three
nights
ago
the
eastern
sky
comes
back
mind
guess
that
was
attacked
this
hill
top
but
with
what
result
cannot
tell
here
longer
and
must
now
look
after
ourselves
and
make
our
own
way
Rivendell
best
can
How
far
Rivendell
asked
Merry
gazing
round
wearily
The
world
looked
wild
and
wide
from
Weathertop
don
know
the
Road
has
ever
been
measured
miles
beyond
the
Forsaken
Inn
day
journey
east
Bree
answered
Strider
Some
say
far
and
some
say
otherwise
strange
road
and
folk
are
glad
reach
their
journey

whether

But

said
Frodo
lot
may
happen
that
time
may
said
Strider
They
stood
for
while
silent
the
hill
top
near
its
southward
edge
that
lonely
place
Frodo
for
the
first
time
fully
realized
his
homelessness
and
danger
wished
bitterly
that
his
fortune
had
left
him
the
quiet
and
beloved
Shire
stared
down
the
hateful
Road
leading
back
westward
his
home
Suddenly
was
aware
that
two
black
specks
were
moving
slowly
along
going
westward
and
looking
again
saw
that
three
others
were
creeping
eastward
meet
them
gave
cry
and
clutched
Strider
arm
Look
said
pointing
downwards
once
Strider
flung
himself
the
ground
behind
the
ruined
circle
pulling
Frodo
down
beside
him
Merry
threw
himself
along
side
What
whispered
not
know
but
fear
the
worst
answered
Strider
Slowly
they
crawled
the
edge
the
ring
again
and
peered
through
cleft
between
two
jagged
stones
The
light
was
longer
bright
for
the
clear
morning
had
faded
and
clouds
creeping
out
the
East
had
now
overtaken
the
sun
began
down
They
could
all
see
the
black
specks
but
neither
Frodo
nor
Merry
could
make
out
their
shapes
for
certain
yet
something
told
them
that
there
far
below
were
Black
Riders
assembling
the
Road
beyond
the
foot
the
hill
Yes
said
Strider
whose
keener
sight
left
him
doubt
The
enemy
here
Hastily
they
crept
away
and
slipped
down
the
north
side
the
hill
find
their
companions
Sam
and
Peregrin
had
not
been
idle
They
had
explored
the
small
dell
and
the
surrounding
slopes
Not
far
away
they
found
spring
clear

Who

Strider

when
came

Sam
and
Pippin
have

the

the

are

Rangers
have
been
here
lately

who

But
there
are
also
several

that

only

two

heavy

one
cannot

but

there
were
many
booted

paused
and
stood

Each
the
hobbits
saw

the
cloaked
and
booted
Riders
the
horsemen
had
already
found
the
dell
the
sooner
Strider
led
them
somewhere
else
the
better
Sam
viewed
the
hollow
with
great
dislike
now
that
had
heard
news
their
enemies
the
Road
only
few
miles
away
Hadn
better
clear
out
quick
Strider
asked
patiently
getting
late
and
don
like
this
hole
makes
heart
sink
somehow
Yes
certainly
must
decide
what
once
answered
Strider
looking
and
considering
the
time
and
the
weather
Well
Sam
said
last
not
like
this
place
either
but
cannot
think
anywhere
better
that
could
reach
before
nightfall
least
are
out
sight
for
the
moment
and

much
more

All
could

out

the

away
the

the
north
side
the

beyond
the

the
country
bare
and
flat
for
miles
Can
the
Riders
see
asked
Merry
mean
they
seem
usually
have
used
their
noses
rather
than
their
eyes
smelling

the

But
you
made

when
you

down

and
now
you

move
was
too
careless
the
hill
top
answered
Strider
was
very
anxious
find
some
sign
Gandalf
but
was
mistake
for
three
and
stand
there
long
For
the
black
horses
can
see
and
the
Riders
can
use
men
and
other
creatures
spies
found
Bree
They
themselves
not
see
the
world
light
but
our
shapes
cast
shadows
their
minds
which
only
the
noon
sun
destroys
and
the
dark
they
perceive
many
signs
and
forms
that
are
hidden
from
then
they
are
most
feared
And
all
times
they
smell
the
blood
living
things
desiring
and
hating
Senses
too
there
are
other
than
sight
smell
can
feel
their
presence
troubled
our
hearts
soon
came
here
and
before
saw
them
they
feel
ours
more
keenly

Frodo
looking
round
wildly

Strider
laid
his
hand
his
shoulder
There
still
hope
said
You
are
not
alone
Let
take
this
wood
that
set
ready
for
the

There
little

defence
here
but
fire
shall
serve
for

Sauron

his

Fire

Maybe
muttered
Sam
also
good
way
saying
here
are
can

bar
shouting
Down
the
lowest
and
most
sheltered
corner
the
dell
they
lit
fire
and
prepared
meal
The
shades
evening
began
fall
and
grew
cold
They
were
suddenly
aware
great
hunger
for
they
had
not
eaten
anything
since
breakfast
but
they
dared
not
make
more
than
frugal
supper
The
lands
ahead
were
empty
all
save
birds
and
beasts
unfriendly
places
deserted
all
the
races
the
world
Rangers
passed
times
beyond
the
hills
but
they
were
few
and
did
not
stay
Other
wanderers
were
rare
and
evil
sort

might
stray
down

Only

You

But

The
cold
increased
darkness
came
Peering
out
from
the
edge
the
dell
they
could
see
nothing
but
grey
land
now
vanishing
quickly
into
shadow
The
sky
above
had
cleared
again
and
was
slowly
filled
with
twinkling
stars
Frodo
and
his
companions
huddled
round
the
fire
wrapped
every
garment
and
blanket
they
possessed
but
Strider
was
content
with
single
cloak
and
sat
little
apart
drawing
thoughtfully
his
pipe
night
fell
and
the
light
the
fire
began
shine
out
brightly
began
tell
them

their

from

They
wondered
how

where

when
paused

Merry

through
the
house
Elrond
you
may

Then
tell
some
other

the
old

begged
Sam

about
the
Elves
before
the
fading

would
dearly
like
hear
more
about
Elves
the

press
round
close
will
tell
you
the
tale
Tintviel
said
Strider
brief
for
long
tale
which
the

not

and
there
are
none
now
except
Elrond

and
yet
may
lift
your

was
silent
for
some
time
and
then
began
not
speak
but
chant
softly
The
leaves
were
long
the
grass
was
green
The
hemlock
umbels
tall
and
fair
And
the
glade

was
seen
stars

Tinuviel
was
dancing
there

And
light
stars
was
her

And
her
raiment
glimmering
There
Beren
came
from
mountains
cold
And
lost
wandered
under
leaves
And
where
the
Elven
river
rolled
walked
alone
and
sorrowing
peered
between
the
hemlock
leaves
And
saw
wonder
flowers
gold
Upon
her
mantle
and
her
sleeves
And
her
hair
like
shadow
following

THE

Enchantment
healed
his
weary
feet
That
over
hills
were
doomed
roam
And
forth
hastened
strong
and
fleet
And
grasped
moonbeams
glistening
Through
woven
woods
Elvenhome
She
lightly
fled
dancing
feet
And
left
him
lonely
still
roam
the
silent
forest
listening
heard
there
oft
the
flying
sound
feet
light
linden
leaves
music
welling
underground
hidden
hollows
quavering
Now
withered
lay
the
hemlock
sheaves
And
one
one
with
sighing
sound
Whispering
fell
the
beechen
leaves
the
wintry
woodland
wavering
sought
her
ever
wandering
far
Where
leaves
years
were
thickly
strewn
light
moon
and
ray

frosty
heavens
shivering
Her
mantle
glinted
the
moon
hill
top
high
and
far
She
danced
and
her
feet
was
strewn
must
silver
quivering
When
winter
passed
she
came
again
And
her
song
released
the
sudden
spring
Like
rising
lark
and
falling
rain
And
melting
water
bubbling
saw
the
elven
flowers
spring
About
her
feet
and
healed
again
longed
her
dance
and
sing
Upon
the
grass
untroubling
Again
she
fled
but
swift
came
Tinuviel
Tinuviel
called
her
her
Elvish
name
And
there
she
halted
listening
One
moment
stood
she
and
spell
His
voice
laid
her
Beren
came
And
doom
fell
Tinuviel
That
his
arms
lay
glistening

Beren
looked
into
her
eyes
Within
the
shadows
her

The
trembling
starlight
the

saw
there
mirrored
shimmering
Tinuviel
the
elven
fair
Immortal
maiden
elven
wise
About
him
cast
her
shadowy
hair
And
arms
like
silver
glimmering
Long
was
the
way
that
fate
them
bore
stony
mountains
cold
and
grey
Through
halls
tron
and
darkling
door
And
woods
nightshade
morrowless
The
Sundering
Seas
between
them
lay
And
yet
last
they
met
once
more
And
long
ago
they
passed
away
the
forest
singing
sorrowless
Strider
sighed
and
paused
before
spoke
again
That
song
said
the
mode
that
called
ann
thennath
among
the
Elves
but
hard
render
our
Common
Speech
and
this
but
rough
echo
tells
the
meeting
Beren
son
Barahir
and
Luthien
Tinuviel
Beren
was
mortal
man
but
Luthien
was
the
daughter
Thingol
King
Elves
upon
Middle
earth
when
the
world
was
young
and
she
was
the
fairest
maiden
that
has
ever
been
among
all
the
children
this
world
the
stars
above
the
mists
the
Northern
lands
was
her
loveliness
and
her
face
was
shining
light
those
days
the
Great
Enemy
whom
Sauron
Mordor
was
but
servant
dwelt
Angband
the
North
and
the
Elves
the
West
coming
back
Middle
earth
made
war
upon
him
regain
the
Silmarils
which
had
stolen
and
the
fathers
Men
aided
the
Elves
But
the
Enemy
was
victorious
and
Barahir
was
slain
and
Beren
escaping
through
great
peril
came
over
the
Mountains
Terror
into
the
hidden
Kingdom
Thingol
the
forest
Neldoreth
There
beheld
Luthien
singing
and
dancing
glade
beside
the
enchanted
river
Esgalduin
and
named
her
Tintviel
that
Nightingale
the
language
old
Many
sorrows
befell
them
afterwards
and
they
were
parted
long
Tintviel
rescued
Beren
from
the
dungeons
Sauron
and
together
they
passed
through
great
dangers
and
cast
down
even
the
Great
Enemy
from
his
throne
and
took
from
his
iron
crown
one
the
three
Silmarils
brightest
all

the
bride
price
Luthien
Thingol
her
father
Yet
the
last
Beren
was
slain
the
Wolf
that
came
from
the
gates
Angband
and
died
the
arms
Tinuviel
But
she
chose
mortality
and
die

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
from
the
world
that
she
might
follow
him
and
sung
that
they
met
again
beyond
the
Sundering
Seas
and
after
brief
time
walking
alive
once
more
the
green
woods
together
they
passed
long
ago
beyond
the
confines
this
world
that
Luthien
Tinuviel
alone
the
Elf
kindred
has
died
indeed
and
left
the
world
and
they
have
lost
her
whom
they
most
loved
But
from
her
the
lineage
the
Elf
lords
old
descended
among
Men
There
live
still
those
whom
Luthien
was
the
foremother
and
said
that
her
line
shall
never
fail
Elrond
Rivendell
that
Kin
For
Beren
and

wedded
that
sailed
his
ship
out
the

the

into
the
seas
heaven
with
the
Silmaril
upon
his
brow
And
Earendil
came
the
Kings
Numenor
that
Westernesse
Strider
was
speaking
they
watched
his
strange
eager
face
dimly
lit
the
red
glow
the
wood
fire
His
eyes
shone
and
his
voice
was
rich
and
deep
Above
him
was
black
starry
sky
Suddenly
pale
light
appeared
over
the
crown
Weathertop
behind
him
The
waxing
moon
was
climbing
slowly
above
the
hill
that
overshadowed
them
and
the
stars
above
the
hill
top
faded
The
story
ended
The
hobbits
moved
and
stretched
Look
said
Merry
The
Moon
rising
must
getting
late
The
others
looked
Even
they
did
they
saw
the
top
the
hill
something
small
and
dark
against
the
glimmer
the
moon
rise
was
perhaps
only
large
stone
jutting
rock
shown
the
pale
light
Sam
and
Merry
got
and
walked
away
from
the
fire
Frodo
and
Pippin
remained
seated
silence
Strider
was
watching
the
moon
light
the
hill
intently
All
seemed
quiet
and
still
but
Frodo
felt
cold
dread
creeping
over
his
heart
now
that
Strider
was
longer
speaking
huddled
closer
the
fire
that
moment
Sam
came
running
back
from
the
edge
the
dell
don
know
what
said
but
suddenly
felt
afraid
durstn
outside
this
dell
for
any
money
felt
that
something
was
creeping
the
slope
Did
you
see
anything
asked
Frodo
springing
his
feet
sir
saw
nothing
but
didn
stop
look
saw
something
said
Merry
thought
did
away
westwards
where
the
moonlight
was
falling
the
flats
beyond
the
shadow
the
hill
tops
thought
there
were
two
three
black
shapes
They
seemed
moving
this
way
Keep
close
the
fire
with
your
faces
outward
cried
Strider
Get
some
the
longer
sticks
ready
your
hands
For
breathless
time
they
sat
there
silent
and
alert
with
their
backs
turned
the
wood
fire
each
gazing
into
the
shadows
that
KNIFE
THE
DARK
195
encircled
them
Nothing
happened
There
was
sound
move
ment
the
night
Frodo
stirred
feeling
that
must
break
the
silence
longed
shout
out
aloud
Hush
whispered
Strider
What
that
gasped
Pippin
the
same
moment
Over
the
lip
the
little
dell
the
side
away
from
the
hill
they
felt
rather
than
saw
shadow
rise
one
shadow
more
than
one
They
strained
their
eyes
and
the
shadows
seemed
grow
Soon
there
could
doubt
three
four
tall
black
figures
were
standing
there
the
slope
looking
down
them
black
were
they
that
they
seemed
like
black
holes
the
deep
shade
behind
them
Frodo
thought
that
heard
faint
hiss
venomous
breath
and
felt
thin
piercing
chill
Then
the
shapes
slowly
advanced
Terror
overcame
Pippin
and
Merry
and
they
threw
themselves
flat
the
ground
Sam
shrank
Frodo
side
Frodo
was
hardly
less
terrified
than
his
companions
was
quaking
was
bitter
cold
but
his
terror
was
swallowed
sudden
temptation
put
the
Ring
The
desire
this
laid
hold
him
and
could
think
nothing
else
did
not
forget
the
Barrow
nor
the
message
Gandalf
but
something
seemed
compelling
him
disregard
all
warnings
and
longed
yield
Not
with
the
hope
escape
doing
anything
either
good
bad
simply
felt
that
must
take
the
Ring
and
put
his
finger
could
not
speak
felt
Sam
looking
him
knew
that
his
master
was
some
great
trouble
but
could
not
turn
towards
him
shut
his
eyes
and
struggled
for
while
but
resistance
became
unbearable
and
last
slowly
drew
out
the
chain
and
slipped
the
Ring
the
forefinger
his
left
hand
Immediately
though
everything
else
remained
before
dim
and
dark
the
shapes
became
terribly
clear
was
able
see
beneath
their
black
wrappings
There
were
five
tall
figures
two
standing
the
lip
the
dell
three
advancing
their
white
faces
burned
keen
and
merciless
eyes
under
their
mantles
were
long
grey
robes
upon
their
grey
hairs
were
helms
silver
their
haggard
hands
were
swords
steel
Their
eyes
fell
him
and
pierced
him
they
rushed
towards
him
Desperate
drew
his
own
sword
and
seemed
him
that
flickered
red
was
firebrand
Two
the
figures
halted
The
third
was
taller
than
the
others
his
hair
was
long
and
gleaming
and
his
helm
was
crown
one
hand
held
long
sword
and
the
other
knife
both
the
knife
and
the
hand
that
held
glowed
with
pale
light
sprang
forward
and
bore
down
Frodo
that
moment
Frodo
threw
himself
forward
the
ground
and
heard
himself
crying
aloud
Elbereth
Gilthoniel
the
same
196
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
time
struck
the
feet
his
enemy
shrill
cry
rang
out
the
night
and
felt
pain
like
dart
poisoned
ice
pierce
his
left
shoulder
Even
swooned
caught
through
swirling
mist
glimpse
Strider
leaping
out
the
darkness
with
flaming
brand
wood
either
hand
With
last
effort
Frodo
dropping
his
sword
slipped
the
Ring
from
his

FLIGHT
THE
FORD
When
Frodo
came
himself
was
still
clutching
the
Ring
desper
ately
was
lying
the
fire
which
was
now
piled
high
and
burning
brightly
His
three
companions
were
bending
over
him
What
has
happened
Where
the
pale
king
asked
wildly
They
were
too
overjoyed
hear
him
speak
answer
for
while
nor
did
they
understand
his
question
length
gathered
from
Sam
that
they
had
seen
nothing
but
the
vague
shadowy
shapes
coming
towards
them
Suddenly
his
horror
Sam
found
that
his
master
had
vanished
and
that
moment
black
shadow
rushed
past
him
and
fell
heard
Frodo
voice
but
seemed
come
from
great
distance
from
under
the
earth
crying
out
strange
words
They
saw
nothing
more
until
they
stumbled
over
the
body
Frodo
lying
dead
face
downwards
the
grass
with
his
sword
beneath
him
Strider
ordered
them
pick
him
and
lay
him
near
the
fire
and
then
disappeared
That
was
now
good
while
ago
Sam
plainly
was
beginning
have
doubts
again
about
Strider
but
while
they
were
talking
returned
appearing
suddenly
out
the
shadows
They
started
and
Sam
drew
his
sword
and
stood
over
Frodo
but
Strider
knelt
down
swiftly
his
side
not
Black
Rider
Sam
said
gently
nor
league
with
them
have
been
trying
discover
something
their
movements
but
have
found
nothing
cannot
think
why
they
have
gone
and
not
attack
again
But
there
feeling
their
presence
anywhere
hand
When
heard
what
Frodo
had
tell
became
full
concern
and
shook
his
head
and
sighed
Then
ordered
Pippin
and
Merry
heat
much
water
they
could
their
small
kettles
and
bathe
the
wound
with
Keep
the
fire
going
well
and
keep
Frodo
warm
said
Then
got
and
walked
away
and
called
Sam
him
think
understand
things
better
now
said
low
voice
There
seem
only
have
been
five
the
enemy
Why
they
were
not
all
here
don
know
but
don
think
they
expected
resisted
They
have
drawn
off
for
the
time
being
But
not
far
fear
They
will
come
again
another
night
cannot
escape
They
are
only
waiting
because
they
think
that
their
purpose
almost
accomplished
and
that
the
Ring
cannot
fly
much
further
fear
Sam
that
they
believe
your
master
has
deadly
wound
that
will
subdue
him

will

THE
LORD

RINGS
Sam
choked
with
tears
Don
despair
said
Strider
You
must
trust
now
Your
Frodo
made
sterner
stuff
than
had
guessed
though
Gandalf
hinted
that
might
prove
not
slain
and
think
will
resist
the
evil
power
the
wound
longer
than
his
enemies
expect
will
all
can
help
and
heal
him
Guard
him
well
while
away
hurried
off
and
disappeared
again
into
the
darkness
Frodo
dozed
though
the
pain
his
wound
was
slowly
growing
and
deadly
chill
was
spreading
from
his
shoulder
his
arm
and
side
His
friends
watched
over
him
warming
him
and
bathing
his
wound
The
night
passed
slowly
and
wearily
Dawn
was
growing
the
sky
and
the
dell
was
filling
with
grey
light
when
Strider
last
returned
Look
cried
and
stooping
lifted
from
the
ground
black
cloak
that
had
lain
there
hidden
the
darkness
foot
above
the
lower
hem
there
was
slash
This
was
the
stroke
Frodo
sword
said
The
only
hurt
that
did
his
enemy
fear
for
unharmed
but
all
blades
perish
that
pierce
that
dreadful
King
More
deadly
him
was
the
name
Elbereth
And
more
deadly
Frodo
was
this
stooped
again
and
lifted
long
thin
knife
There
was
cold
gleam
Strider
raised
they
saw
that
near
the
end
its
edge
was
notched
and
the
point
was
broken
off
But
even
held
the
growing
light
they
gazed
astonishment
for
the
blade
seemed
melt
and
vanished
like
smoke
the
air
leaving
only
the
hilt
Strider
hand
Alas
cried
was
this
accursed
knife
that
gave
the
wound
Few
now
have
the
skill
healing
match
such
evil
weapons
But
will
what
can
sat
down
the
ground
and
taking
the
dagger
hilt
laid
his
knees
and
sang
over
slow
song
strange
tongue
Then
setting
aside
turned
Frodo
and
soft
tone
spoke
words
the
others
could
not
catch
From
the
pouch
his
belt
drew
out
the
long
leaves
plant
These
leaves
said
have
walked
far
find
for
this
plant
does
not
grow
the
bare
hills
but
the
thickets
away
south
the
Road
found
the
dark
the
scent
its
leaves
crushed
leaf
his
fingers
and
gave
out
sweet
and
pungent
fragrance
fortunate
that
could
find
for
healing

that
the
Men

West
brought
Middle

they
named
and
grows
now
sparsely
and
only
near
places
where
they
dwelt
camped
old
and
not

the

except
some
those
who

the
Wild
has
great
virtues
but
over
such
wound
this
its
healing
powers
may
small
threw
the
leaves
into
boiling
water
and
bathed

The
fragrance
the

was
refreshing

unhurt
felt
their
minds
calmed
and
cleared
The
herb
had
also
some
power
over
the
wound
for
Frodo
felt
the
pain
and
also
the
sense
frozen
cold
lessen
his
side
but
the
life
did
not
return
his
arm
and
could
not
raise
use
his
hand
bitterly
regretted
his
foolishness
and
reproached
himself
for
weakness
will
for
now
perceived
that
putting
the
Ring
obeyed
not
his
own
desire
but
the
commanding
wish
his
enemies
wondered
would
remain
maimed
for
life
and
how
they
would
now
manage
continue
their
journey
felt
too
weak
stand
The
others
were
discussing
this
very
question
They
quickly
decided
leave
Weathertop
soon
possible
think
now
said
Strider
that
the
enemy
has
been
watching
this
place
for
some
days
Gandalf
ever
came
here
then
must
have
been
forced
ride
away
and
will
not
return
any
case
are
great
peril
here
after
dark
since
the
attack
last
night
and
can
hardly
meet
greater
danger
wherever
soon
the
daylight
was
full
they
had
some
hurried
food
and
packed
was
impossible
for
Frodo
walk
they
divided
the
greater
part
their
baggage
among
the
four
them
and
put
Frodo
the
pony
the
last
few
days
the
poor
beast
had
improved
wonder
fully
already
seemed
fatter
and
stronger
and
had
begun
show
affection
for
its
new
masters
especially
for
Sam
Bill
Ferny
treatment
must
have
been
very
hard
for
the
journey
the
wild
seem
much
better
than
its
former
life
They
started
off
southerly
direction
This
would
mean
crossing
the
Road
but
was
the
quickest
way
more
wooded
country
And
they
needed
fuel
for
Strider
said
that
Frodo
must
kept
warm
especially
night
while
fire
would
some
protection
for
them
all
was
also
his
plan
shorten
their
journey
cutting
across
another
great
loop
the
Road
east
beyond
Weathertop
changed
its
course
and
took
wide
bend
northwards
They
made
their
way
slowly
and
cautiously
round
the
south
western
slopes
the
hill
and
came
little
while
the
edge
the
Road
There
was
sign
the
Riders
But
even
they
were
hurrying
across
they
heard
far
away
two
cries
cold
voice
calling
and
cold
voice
answering
Trembling
they
sprang
forward
and
made
for
the
thickets
that
lay
ahead
The
land
before
them
sloped
away
southwards
but
was
wild
and
pathless
bushes
and
stunted
trees
grew
dense
patches
with
wide
barren
spaces
between
The
grass
was
scanty
coarse
and
grey
and
the
leaves
the
thickets
were
faded
and
falling
was
cheerless
land
and
their
journey
was
slow
and
gloomy
They
spoke
little
they
trudged
along
Frodo
heart
was
grieved
watched
them
walking
beside
him
with
their
heads

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
down
and
their
backs
bowed
under
their
burdens
Even
Strider
seemed
tired
and
heavy
hearted
Before
the
first
day
march
was
over
Frodo
pain
began
grow
again
but
did
not
speak
for
long
time
Four
days
passed
without
the
ground
the
scene
changing
much
except
that
behind
them
Weathertop
slowly
sank
and
before
them
the
distant
mountains
loomed
little
nearer
Yet
since
that
far
cry
they
had
seen
and
heard
sign
that
the
enemy
had
marked
their
flight
followed
them
They
dreaded
the
dark
hours
and
kept
watch
pairs
night
expecting
any
time
see
black
shapes
stalking
the
grey
night
dimly
lit
the
cloud
veiled
moon
but
they
saw
nothing
and
heard
sound
but
the
sigh
withered
leaves
and
grass
Not
once
did
they
feel
the
sense
present
evil
that
had
assailed
them
before
the
attack
the
dell
seemed
too
much
hope
that
the
Riders
had
already
lost
their
trail
again
Perhaps
they
were
waiting
make
some
ambush
narrow
place
the
end
the
fifth
day
the
ground
began
once
more
rise
slowly
out
the
wide
shallow
valley
into
which
they
had
descended
Strider
now
turned
their
course
again
north
eastwards
and
the
sixth
day
they
reached
the
top
long
slow
climbing
slope
and
saw
far
ahead
huddle
wooded
hills
Away
below
them
they
could
see
the
Road
sweeping
round
the
feet
the
hills
and
their
right
grey
river
gleamed
pale
the
thin
sunshine
the
distance
they
glimpsed
yet
another
river
stony
valley
half
veiled
mist
afraid
must
back
the
Road
here
for
while
said
Strider
have
now
come
the
River
Hoarwell
that
the
Elves
call
Mitheithel
flows
down
out
the
Ettenmoors
the
troll
fells
north
Rivendell
and
joins
the
Loudwater
away
the
South
Some
call
the
Greyflood
after
that
great
water
before
finds
the
Sea
There
way
over
below
its
sources
the
Ettenmoors
except
the
Last
Bridge
which
the
Road
crosses
What
that
other
river
can
see
far
away
there
asked
Merry
That
Loudwater
the
Bruinen
Rivendell
answered
Strider
The
Road
runs
along
the
edge
the
hills
for
many
miles
from
the
Bridge
the
Ford
Bruinen
But
have
not
yet
thought
how
shall
cross
that
water
One
river
time
shall
fortunate
indeed

find
the
Last
Bridge
held
against
Next
day
early
the
morning
they
came
down
again
the
borders
the
Road
Sam
and
Strider
went
forward
but
they
found
sign
any
travellers
riders
Here
under
the
shadow
the
hills
there
had
been
some
rain
Strider
judged
that
had
fallen
two
days
before
and
had
washed
away
all
footprints
horseman
had
passed
since
then
far
could
see
FLIGHT
THE
FORD
201
They
hurried
along
with
all
the
speed
they
could
make
and
after
mile
two
they
saw
the
Last
Bridge
ahead
the
bottom
short
steep
slope
They
dreaded
see
black
figures
waiting
there
but
they
saw
none
Strider
made
them
take
cover
thicket
the
side
the
Road
while
went
forward
explore
Before
long
came
hurrying
back
can
see
sign
the
enemy
said
and
wonder
very
much
what
that
means
But
have
found
something
very
strange
held
out
his
hand
and
showed
single
pale
green
jewel
found
the
mud
the
middle
the
Bridge
said
beryl
elf
stone
Whether
was
set
there
let
fall
chance
cannot
say
but
brings
hope
will
take
sign
that
may
pass
the
Bridge
but
beyond
that
dare
not
keep
the
Road
without
some
clearer
token
once
they
went
again
They
crossed
the
Bridge
safety
hearing
sound
but
the
water
swirling
against
its
three
great
arches
mile
further
they
came
narrow
ravine
that
led
away
north
wards
through
the
steep
lands
the
left
the
Road
Here
Strider
turned
aside
and
soon
they
were
lost
sombre
country
dark
trees
winding
among
the
feet
sullen
hills
The
hobbits
were
glad
leave
the
cheerless
lands
and
the
perilous
Road
behind
them
but
this
new
country
seemed
threatening
and
unfriendly
they
went
forward
the
hills
about
them
steadily
rose
Here
and
there
upon
heights
and
ridges
they
caught
glimpses
ancient
walls
stone
and
the
ruins
towers
they
had
ominous
look
Frodo
who
was
not
walking
had
time
gaze
ahead
and
think
recalled
Bilbo
account
his
journey
and
the
threatening
towers
the
hills
north
the
Road
the
country
near
the
Trolls
wood
where
his
first
serious
adventure
had
happened
Frodo
guessed
that
they
were
now
the
same
region
and
wondered
chance
they
would
pass
near
the
spot
Who
lives
this
land
asked
And
who
built
these
towers
this
troll
country
said
Strider
Trolls
not
build
one
lives
this
land
Men
once
dwelt
here
ages
ago
but
none
remain
now
They
became
evil
people
legends
tell
for
they
fell
under
the
shadow
Angmar
But
all
were
destroyed
the
war
that
brought
the
North
Kingdom
its
end
But
that
now
long
ago
that
the
hills
have
forgotten
them
though
shadow
still
lies
the
land
Where
did
you
learn
such
tales
all
the
land
empty
and
forget
ful
asked
Peregrin
The
birds
and
beasts
not
tell
tales
that
sort
The
heirs
Elendil
not
forget
all
things
past
said
Strider
202
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
and
many
more
things
than
can
tell
are
remembered
Rivendell
Have
you
often
been
Rivendell
said
Frodo
have
said
Strider
dwelt
there
once
and
still
return
when
may
There
heart
but
not
fate
sit
peace
even
the
fair
house
Elrond
The
hills
now
began
shut
them
The
Road
behind
held
its
way
the
River
Bruinen
but
both
were
now
hidden
from
view
The
travellers
came
into
long
valley
narrow
deeply
cloven
dark
and
silent
Trees
with
old
and
twisted
roots
hung
over
cliffs
and
piled
behind
into
mounting
slopes
pine
wood
The
hobbits
grew
very
weary
They
advanced
slowly
for
they
had
pick
their
way
through
pathless
country
encumbered
fallen
trees
and
tumbled
rocks
long
they
could
they
avoided
climbing
for
Frodo
sake
and
because
was
fact
difficult
find
any
way
out
the
narrow
dales
They
had
been
two
days
this
country
when
the
weather
turned
wet
The
wind
began
blow
steadily
out
the
West
and
pour
the
water
the
distant
seas
the
dark
heads
the
hills
fine
drenching
rain
nightfall
they
were
all
soaked
and
their
camp
was
cheerless
for
they
could
not
get
any
fire
burn
The
next
day
the
hills
rose
still
higher
and
steeper
before
them
and
they
were
forced
turn
away
northwards
out
their
course
Strider
seemed
getting
anxious
they
were
nearly
ten
days
out
from
Weathertop
and
their
stock
provisions
was
beginning
run
low
went
raining
That
night
they
camped
stony
shelf
with
rock
wall
behind
them
which
there
was
shallow
cave
mere
scoop
the
cliff
Frodo
was
restless
The
cold
and
wet
had
made
his
wound
more
painful
than
ever
and
the
ache
and
sense
deadly
chill
took
away
all
sleep
lay
tossing
and
turning
and
listening
fearfully
the
stealthy
night
noises
wind
chinks
rock
water
dripping
crack
the
sudden
rattling
fall
loosened
stone
felt
that
black
shapes
were
advancing
smother
him
but
when
sat
saw
nothing
but
the
back
Strider
sitting
hunched
smoking
his
pipe
and
watching
lay
down
again
and
passed
into
uneasy
dream
which
walked
the
grass
his
garden
the
Shire
but
seemed
faint
and
dim
less
clear
than
the
tall
black
shadows
that
stood
looking
over
the
hedge
the
morning
woke
find
that
the
rain
had
stopped
The
clouds
were
still
thick
but
they
were
breaking
and
pale
strips
blue
appeared
between
them
The
wind
was
shifting
again
They
did
not
start
early
Immediately
after
their
cold
and
comfortless
breakfast
Strider
went
off
alone
telling
the
others
remain
under
the
shelter

When
returned
was
not
reassuring

Rivendell
That

country
and
little
known
could
perhaps
find
our
way
through
and
come
round
Rivendell
from
the
north
but
would
take
too
long
for
not

the

and
our
food
would
not
last
somehow
other
must
find
the

The
rest
that
day
they
spent
scrambling
over
rocky
ground
They
found
passage
between
two
hills
that
led
them
into
valley
running
south
east
the
direction
that
they
wished
take
but
towards
the
end
the
day
they
found
their
road
again
barred
ridge
high
land
its
dark
edge
against
the
sky
was
broken
into
many
bare
points
like
teeth
blunted
saw
They
had
choice
between
going
back
climbing
over
They
decided
attempt
the
climb
but
proved
very
difficult
Before
long
Frodo
was
obliged
dismount
and
struggle
along
foot
Even
they
often
despaired
getting
their
pony
indeed
finding
path
for
themselves
burdened
they
were
The
light
was
nearly
gone
and
they
were
all
exhausted
when
last
they
reached
the
top
They
had
climbed
narrow
saddle
between
two
higher
points
and
the
land
fell
steeply
away
again
only
short
distance
ahead
Frodo
threw
himself
down
and
lay
the
ground
shivering
His
left
arm
was
lifeless
and
his
side
and
shoulder
felt
icy
claws
were
laid
upon
them
The
trees
and
rocks
about
him
seemed
shadowy
and
dim
cannot
any
further
said
Merry
Strider
afraid
this
has
been
too
much
for
Frodo
dreadfully
anxious
about
him
What
are
you
think
they
will
able
cure
him
Rivendell
ever
get
there
shall
see
answered
Strider
There
nothing
more
that
can
the
wilderness
and
chiefly
because
his
wound
that
anxious
press
But
agree
that
can
further
tonight
What
the
matter
with
master
asked
Sam
low
voice
looking
appealingly
Strider
His
wound
was
small
and
already
closed
There
nothing
seen
but
cold
white
mark
his
shoulder
Frodo
has
been
touched
the
weapons
the
Enemy
said
Strider
and
there
some
poison
evil
work
that
beyond
skill
drive
out
But
not
give
hope

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Night
was
cold
the
high
ridge
They
lit
small
fire
down
under
the
gnarled
roots
old
pine
that
hung
over
shallow
pit
looked
stone
had
once
been
quarried
there
They
sat
huddled
together
The
wind
blew
chill
through
the
pass
and
they
heard
the
tree
tops
lower
down
moaning
and
sighing
Frodo
lay
half
dream
imagining
that
endless
dark
wings
were
sweeping
above
him
and
that
the
wings
rode
pursuers
that
sought
him
all
the
hollows
the
hills
The
morning
dawned
bright
and
fair
the
air
was
clean
and
the
light
pale
and
clear
rain
washed
sky
Their
hearts
were
encour
aged
but
they
longed
for
the
sun
warm
their
cold
stiff
limbs
soon
was
light
Strider
took
Merry
with
him
and
went
survey
the
country
from
the
height
the
east
the
pass
The
sun
had
risen
and
was
shining
brightly
when
returned
with
more
comforting
news
They
were
now
going
more
less
the
right
direction
they
went
down
the
further
side
the
ridge
they
would
have
the
Mountains
their
left
Some
way
ahead
Strider
had
caught
glimpse
the
Loudwater
again
and
knew
that
though
was
hidden
from
view
the
Road
the
Ford
was
not
far
from
the
River
and
lay
the
side
nearest
them
must
make
for
the
Road
again
said
cannot
hope
find
path
through
these
hills
Whatever
danger
may
beset
the
Road
our
only
way
the
Ford
soon
they
had
eaten
they
set
out
again
They
climbed
slowly
down
the
southern
side
the
ridge
but
the
way
was
much
easier
than
they
had
expected
for
the
slope
was
far
less
steep
this
side
and
before
long
Frodo
was
able
ride
again
Bill
Ferny
poor
old
pony
was
developing
unexpected
talent
for
picking
out
path
and
for
sparing
its
rider
many
jolts
possible
The
spirits
the
party
rose
again
Even
Frodo
felt
better
the
morning
light
but
every
now
and
again
mist
seemed
obscure
his
sight
and
passed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
Pippin
was
little
ahead
the
others
Suddenly
turned
round
and
called
them
There
path
here
cried
When
they
came
with
him
they
saw
that
had
made
mistake
there
were
clearly
the
beginnings
path
that
climbed
with
many
windings
out
the
woods
below
and
faded
away
the
hill
top
behind
places
was
now
faint
and
overgrown
choked
with
fallen
stones
and
trees
but
one
time
seemed
have
been
much
used
was
path
made
strong
arms
and
heavy
feet
Here
and
there
old
trees
had
been
cut
broken
down
and
large
rocks
cloven
heaved
aside
make
way
They
followed
the
track
for
some
while
for
offered
much
the
FLIGHT
THE
FORD
205
easiest
way
down
but
they
went
cautiously
and
their
anxiety
increased
they
came
into
the
dark
woods
and
the
path
grew
plainer
and
broader
Suddenly
coming
out
belt
fir
trees
ran
steeply
down
slope
and
turned
sharply
the
left
round
the
corner
rocky
shoulder
the
hill
When
they
came
the
corner
they
looked
round
and
saw
that
the
path
ran
over
level
strip
under
the
face
low
cliff
overhung
with
trees
the
stony
wall
there
was
door
hanging
crookedly
ajar
upon
one
great
hinge
Outside
the
door
they
all
halted
There
was
cave
rock
chamber
behind
but
the
gloom
inside
nothing
could
seen
Strider
Sam
and
Merry
pushing
with
all
their
strength
managed
open
the
door
little
wider
and
then
Strider
and
Merry
went
They
did
not
far
for
the
floor
lay
many
old
bones
and
nothing
else
was
seen
near
the
entrance
except
some
great
empty
jars
and
broken
pots
Surely
this
troll
hole
ever
there
was
one
said
Pippin
Come
out
you
two
and
let
get
away
Now
know
who
made
the
path
and
had
better
get
off
quick
There
need
think
said
Strider
coming
out
certainly
troll
hole
but
seems
have
been
long
forsaken
don
think
need
afraid
But
let
down
warily
and
shall
see
The
path
went
again
from
the
door
and
turning
the
right
again
across
the
level
space
plunged
down
thick
wooded
slope
Pippin
not
liking
show
Strider
that
was
still
afraid
went
ahead
with
Merry
Sam
and
Strider
came
behind
one
each
side
Frodo
pony
for
the
path
was
now
broad
enough
for
four
five
hobbits
walk
abreast
But
they
had
not
gone
very
far
before
Pippin
came
running
back
followed
Merry
They
both
looked
terrified
There
are
trolls
Pippin
panted
Down
clearing
the
woods
not
far
below
got
sight
them
through
the
tree
trunks
They
are
very
large
will
come
and
look
them
said
Strider
picking
stick
Frodo
said
nothing
but
Sam
looked
scared
The
sun
was
now
high
and
shone
down
through
the
half
stripped
branches
the
trees
and
lit
the
clearing
with
bright
patches
light
They
halted
suddenly
the
edge
and
peered
through
the
tree
trunks
holding
their
breath
There
stood
the
trolls
three
large
trolls
One
was
stooping
and
the
other
two
stood
staring
him
Strider
walked
forward
unconcernedly
Get
old
stone
said
and
broke
his
stick
upon
the
stooping
troll
Nothing
happened
There
was
gasp
astonishment
from
the
hobbits
and
then
even
Frodo
laughed
Well
said
are
forget
ting
our
family
history
These
must
the
very
three
that
were
caught

the
right
way

thirteen
dwarves
and
one
hobbit
had
idea
were
anywhere
near
the
place
said
Pippin
knew
the
story
well
Bilbo
and
Frodo
had
told
often
but
matter
fact
had
never
more
than
half
believed
Even
now
looked
the
stone
trolls
with
suspicion
wondering
some
magic
might
not
suddenly
bring
them
life
again
You
are
forgetting
not
only
your
family
history
but
all
you
ever
knew
about
trolls
said
Strider
broad
daylight
with
bright
sun
and
yet
you
come
back
trying
scare
with
tale
live
trolls
waiting
for
this
glade
any
case
you
might
have
noticed
that
one
them
has
old
bird
nest
behind
his
ear
That
would
most
unusual
ornament
for
live
troll
They
all
laughed
Frodo
felt
his
spirits
reviving
the
reminder
Bilbo
first
successful
adventure
was
heartening
The
sun
too
was
warm
and
comforting
and
the
mist
before
his
eyes
seemed
lifting
little
They
rested
for
some
time
the
glade
and
took
their
mid
day
meal
right
under
the
shadow
the
trolls
large
legs
Won
somebody
give
bit
song
while
the
sun
high
said
Merry
when
they
had
finished
haven
had
song

for
days
Not
since
Weathertop
said
Frodo
The
others
looked
him
Don
worry
about
added
feel
much
better
but
don
think
could
sing
Perhaps
Sam
could
dig
something
out
his
memory
Come
Sam
said
Merry
There
more
stored
your

said
Sam
But
how
would
this

what

But

Standing

the
afternoon
they
went
down
the
woods
They
were
prob
ably
following
the
very
track
that
Gandalf
Bilbo
and
the
dwarves
had
used
many
years
before
After
few
miles
they
came
out
the
top
high
bank
above
the
Road
this
point
the
Road
had
left
the
Hoarwell
far
behind
its
narrow
valley
and
now
clung
close
the
feet
the
hills
rolling
and
winding
eastward
among
woods
and
heather
covered
slopes
towards
the
Ford
and
the
Mountains
Not
far
down
the
bank
Strider
pointed
out
stone
the
grass
roughly
cut
and
now
much
weathered
could
still
seen
dwarf
runes
and
secret
marks
There
said
Merry
That

the
stone
that
marked
the
place
where
the
trolls
gold
was
hidden
How
much
left
Bilbo

Frodo
looked
the
stone
and
wished
that

Bilbo

from

The
Road
lay
quiet
under
the
long
shadows
early
evening
There
was

any
other
travellers
seen
there
was
now

possible
course
for
them

they
climbed
down
the
bank
and

the
hills

off
the
light
the
fast
westering

wind
flowed
down

them
from
the

ahead
They
were
beginning
look
out
for
place
off
the
Road
where
they
could
camp
for
the
night
when
they
heard
sound
that
brought

FORD
209
sudden
fear
back
into
their
hearts
the
noise
hoofs
behind
them
They
looked
back
but
they
could
not
see
far
because
the
many
windings
and
rollings
the
Road
quickly
they
could
they
scrambled
off
the
beaten
way
and
into
the
deep
heather
and
bilberry
brushwood
the
slopes
above
until
they
came
small
patch
thick
growing
hazels
they
peered
out
from
among
the
bushes
they
could
see
the
Road
faint
and
grey
the
failing
light
some
thirty
feet
below
them
The
sound
hoofs
drew
nearer
They
were
going
fast
with
light
clippety
clippety
clip
Then
faintly
was
blown
away
from
them
the
breeze
they
seemed
catch
dim
ringing
small
bells
tinkling
That
does
not
sound
like
Black
Rider
horse
said
Frodo
listening
intently
The
other
hobbits
agreed
hopefully
that
did
not
but
they
all
remained
full
suspicion
They
had
been
fear
pursuit
for
long
that
any
sound
from
behind
seemed
ominous
and
unfriendly
But
Strider
was
now
leaning
forward
stooped
the
ground
with
hand
his
ear
and
look
joy
his
face
The
light
faded
and
the
leaves
the
bushes
rustled
softly
Clearer
and
nearer
now
the
bells
jingled
and
clippety
clip
came
the
quick
trotting
feet
Suddenly
into
view
below
came
white
horse
gleaming
the
shadows
running
swiftly
the
dusk
its
headstall
flickered
and
flashed
were
studded
with
gems
like
living
stars
The
rider
cloak
streamed
behind
him
and
his
hood
was
thrown
back
his
golden
hair
flowed
shimmering
the
wind
his
speed
Frodo
appeared
that
white
light
was
shining
through
the
form
and
raiment
the
rider
through
thin
veil
Strider
sprang
from
hiding
and
dashed
down
towards
the
Road
leaping
with
cry
through
the
heather
but
even
before
had
moved
called
the
rider
had
reined
his
horse
and
halted
looking
towards
the
thicket
where
they
stood
When
saw
Strider
dis
mounted
and
ran
meet
him
calling
out
vedui
Dunadan
Mae
govannen
His
speech
and
clear
ringing
voice
left
doubt
their
hearts
the
rider
was
the
Elven
folk
others
that
dwelt
the
wide
world
had
voices
fair
hear
But
there
seemed
note
haste
fear
his
call
and
they
saw
that
was
now
speaking
quickly
and
urgently
Strider
Soon
Strider
beckoned
them
and
the
hobbits
left
the
bushes
and
hurried
down
the
Road
This
Glorfindel
who
dwells
the
house
Elrond
said
Strider
Hail
and
well
met
last
said
the
Elf
lord
Frodo
was
sent
from
Rivendell
look
for
you
feared
that
you
were
danger
upon
the
road
Then
Gandalf
has
reached
Rivendell
cried
Frodo
joyfully
had
not
when
departed
but
that
was
nine
days
ago

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
answered
Glorfindel
Elrond
received
news
that
troubled
him
Some
kindred
journeying
your
land
beyond
the
Baranduin
learned
that
things
were
amiss
and
sent
messages
swiftly
they
could
They
said
that
the
Nine
were
abroad
and
that
you
were
astray
bearing
great
burden
without
guidance
for
Gandalf
had
not
returned
There
are
few
even
Rivendell
that
can
ride
openly
against
the
Nine
but
such
there
were
Elrond
sent
out
north
west
and
south
was
thought
that
you
might
turn
far
aside
avoid
pursuit
and
become
lost
the
Wilderness
was
lot
take
the
Road
and
came
the
Bridge
Mitheithel
and
left
token
there
nigh
seven
days
ago
Three
the
servants
Sauron
were
upon
the
Bridge
but
they
withdrew
and
pursued
them
westward
came
also
upon
two
others
but
they
turned
away
southward
Since
then
have
searched
for
your
trail
Two
days
ago
found
and
followed
over
the
Bridge
and
today
marked
where
you
descended
from
the
hills
again
But
come
There
time
for
further
news
Since
you
are
here
must
risk
the
peril
the
Road
and
There
are
five
behind
and
when
they
find
your
trail
upon
the
Road
they
will
ride
after
like
the
wind
And
they
are
not
all
Where
the
other
four
may
not
know
fear
that
may
find
the
Ford
already
held
against
While
Glorfindel
was
speaking
the
shades
evening
deepened
Frodo
felt
great
weariness
come
over
him
Ever
since
the
sun
began
sink
the
mist
before
his
eyes
had
darkened
and
felt
that
shadow
was
coming
between
him
and
the
faces
his
friends
Now
pain
assailed
him
and

the

taking
him
gently
his

looked
his

with
grave
anxiety
Briefly
Strider
told
the
attack
their

under
Weathertop
and
the
deadly
knife
drew
out
the
hilt
which
had
kept
and
handed

Glorfindel
shuddered

looked
intently

his
face
grew
graver
what
learned
disquieted
him
But
Frodo
felt
the
chill
lessen
his
side
and
arm
little
warmth
crept
down
from
his
shoulder
his
hand
and
the
pain
grew
easier
The
dusk
evening
seemed
grow
lighter
about
him

saw
his

Frodo
had

and
was
persuaded
mount
Glorfindel
white
horse
The
pony
was
laden
instead
with
great
part
the
others
burdens
that
they
now
marched
lighter
and
for
time
made
good
speed
but
the
hobbits
began
find
hard
keep
with
the
swift
tireless
feet
the
Elf
led
them
into
the
mouth
darkness
and
still
under
the
deep
clouded
night
There
was
neither
star
nor
moon
Not
until
the
grey
dawn
did
allow
them
halt
Pippin
Merry
and
Sam
were
that
time
nearly
asleep
their
stumbling
legs
and
even
Strider
seemed
the
sag
his
shoulders
weary
Frodo
sat
upon
the
horse
dark
dream
They
cast
themselves
down
the
heather
few
yards
from
the
road
side
and
fell
asleep
immediately
They
seemed
hardly
have
closed
their
eyes
when
Glorfindel
who
had
set
himself
watch
while
they
slept
awoke
them
again
The
sun
had
now
climbed
far
into
the
morning
and
the
clouds
and
mists
the
night
were
gone
Drink
this
said
Glorfindel
them
pouring
for
each
turn
little
liquor
from
his
silver
studded
flask
leather
was
clear
spring
water
and
had
taste
and
did
not
feel
either
cool
warm
the
mouth
but
strength
and
vigour
seemed
flow
into
all
their
limbs
they
drank
Eaten
after
that
draught
the
stale
bread
and
dried
fruit
which
was
now
all
that
they
had
left
seemed
satisfy
their
hunger
better
than
many
good
breakfast
the
Shire
had
done

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
They
had
rested
rather
less
than
five
hours
when
they
took
the
Road
again
Glorfindel
still
urged
them
and
only
allowed
two
brief
halts
during
the
day
march
this
way
they
covered
almost
twenty
miles
before
nightfall
and
came
point
where
the
Road
bent
right
and
ran
down
towards
the
bottom
the
valley
now
making
straight
for
the
Bruinen
far
there
had
been
sign
sound
pursuit
that
the
hobbits
could
see
hear
but
often
Glorfindel
would
halt
and
listen
for
moment
they
lagged
behind
and
look
anxiety
clouded
his
face
Once
twice
spoke
Strider
the
elf
tongue
But
however
anxious
their
guides
might
was
plain
that
the
hobbits
could
further
that
night
They
were
stumbling
along
dizzy
with
weariness
and
unable
think
anything
but
their
feet
and
legs
Frodo
pain
had
redoubled
and
during
the
day
things
about
him
faded
shadows
ghostly
grey
almost
welcomed
the
coming
night
for
then
the
world
seemed
less
pale
and
empty
The
hobbits
were
still
weary
when
they
set
out
again
early
next
morning
There
were
many
miles
yet
between
them
and
the
Ford
and
they
hobbled
forward
the
best
pace
they
could
manage
Our
peril
will
greatest
just
ere

the
river
said
Glorfin
del
for
heart
warns
that
the
pursuit
now
swift
behind
and
other
danger
may
waiting
the
Ford
The
Road
was
still
running
steadily
downhill
and
there
was
now
places
much
grass
either
side
which
the
hobbits
walked
when
they
could
ease
their
tired
feet
the
late
afternoon
they
came
place
where
the
Road
went
suddenly
under
the
dark
shadow
tall
pine
trees
and
then
plunged
into
deep
cutting
with
steep
moist
walls
red
stone
Echoes
ran
along
they
hurried
forward
and
there
seemed
sound
many
footfalls
following
their
own
All
once
through
gate
light
the
Road
ran
out
again
from
the
end
the
tunnel
into
the
open
There
the
bottom
sharp
incline
they
saw
before
them
long
flat
mile
and
beyond
that
the
Ford
Rivendell
the
further
side
was
steep
brown
bank
threaded
winding
path
and
behind
that
the
tall
mountains
climbed
shoulder

and
peak

into
the
fading
sky
There
was
still
echo
following

the
cutting
behind
them
rushing
noise
wind
were
rising
and
pouring
through
the
branches
the
pines
One
moment
Glorfindel
turned
and
listened
then
sprang
forward
with
loud
cry
Fly

suddenly
there
was
noise
horses

ing
Out
the

the
trees
that
they
had
just
left
rode
Black
Rider
reined
his
horse
and
halted
swaying
his
saddle
Another
followed
him
and
then
another
then
again

more
Ride
forward

cried
Glorfindel
Frodo
did
not
obey
once
for
strange
reluctance
seized
him
Checking
the
horse
walk
turned
and
looked
back
The
Riders
seemed
sit
upon
their
great
steeds
like
threatening
statues
upon
hill
dark
and
solid
while
all
the
woods
and
land
about
them
receded
into
mist
Suddenly
knew
his
heart
that
they
were
silently
commanding
him
wait
Then
once
fear
and
hatred
awoke
him
His
hand
left
the
bridle
and
gripped
the
hilt
his
sword
and
with
red
flash
drew

cried
Glorfindel
and
then
loud
and
clear
called

once
the
white
horse
sprang
away
and
sped
like
the
wind
along
the
last
lap
the
Road
the
same
moment
the
black
horses
leaped
down
the
hill
pursuit
and
from
the
Riders
came
terrible
cry
such
Frodo
had
heard
filling
the
woods
with
horror
the
Eastfar
thing
far
away
was
answered
and
the
dismay
Frodo
and
his
friends

from

trees
and
rocks
away
the

four
other
Riders
came
flying
Two
rode
towards
Frodo
two
galloped
madly
towards
the
Ford
cut
off
his
escape
They
seemed
him
run
like
the
wind
and
grow
swiftly
larger
and
darker
their
courses
converged
with
his
Frodo
looked
back
for
moment
over
his
shoulder
could
longer
see
his
friends
The
Riders
behind
were
falling
back
even
their
great
steeds
were
match
speed
for
the
white
elf
horse
Glorfindel
looked
forward
again
and
hope
faded
There
seemed
chance
reaching
the
Ford
before
was
cut
off
the
others
that
had
lain
ambush
could
see
them
clearly
now
they
appeared
have
cast
aside
their
hoods
and
black
cloaks
and
they
were
robed
white
and
grey
Swords
were
naked
their
pale
hands
helms
were
their
heads
Their
cold
eyes
glittered
and
they
called

with
fell
voices
Fear
now
filled

longer
his

came
from

shut
his

and
clung
the

The
wind
whistled
his
ears
and
the
bells
upon
the
harness
rang
wild
and
shrill
breath
deadly
cold
pierced
him
like
spear
with
last
spurt
like

the

Frodo
heard
the

about

the

left

and
struggled

THE

the
stony
path
was
climbing
the
steep
bank
was
across
the
Ford
But
the
pursuers
were
close
behind
the
top
the
bank
the
horse
halted
and
turned
about
neighing
fiercely
There
were
Nine
Riders
the
water
edge
below
and
Frodo
spirit
quailed
before
the
threat
their
uplifted
faces
knew
nothing
that
would
prevent
them
from
crossing
easily
had
done
and
felt
that
was
useless
try
escape
over
the
long
uncertain
path
from
the
Ford
the
edge
Rivendell
once
the
Riders
crossed
any
case
felt
that
was
commanded
urgently
halt
Hatred
again
stirred
him
but
had
longer
the
strength
refuse
Suddenly
the
foremost
Rider
spurred
his
horse
forward
checked
the
water
and
reared
With
great
effort
Frodo
sat
upright
and
brandished
his
sword
back
cried
back

His
voice
sounded
thin
and
shrill
his
own
ears
The
Riders
halted
but
Frodo
had
not
the

His
enemies
laughed
him
with
harsh
and
chilling
laughter

Then
the
leader
who
was
now
half
across
the
Ford
stood
menacing
his
stirrups
and
raised
his
hand
Frodo
was
stricken
dumb
felt
his
tongue
cleave
his
mouth
and
his
heart
labouring
His
sword
broke
and
fell
out
his
shaking
hand
The
elf
horse
reared
and
snorted
The
foremost
the
black
horses
had
almost
set
foot
upon
the
shore
that
moment
there
came
roaring
and
rushing
noise
loud
waters
rolling
many
stones
Dimly
Frodo
saw
the
river
below
him
rise
and
down
along
its
course
there
came
plumed
cavalry
waves
White
flames
seemed
Frodo
flicker
their
crests
and
half
fancied
that
saw
amid
the
water
white
riders
upon
white
horses
with
frothing
manes
The
three
Riders
that
were
still
the
midst
the
Ford
were
overwhelmed
they
disappeared
buried
suddenly
under
angry
foam
Those
that
were
behind
drew
back
dismay
With
his
last
failing
senses
Frodo
heard
cries
and
seemed
him
that
saw
beyond
the
Riders
that
hesitated
the
shore
shining
figure
white
light
and
behind
ran
small
shadowy
forms
waving
flames
that
flared

grey
mist

was

The

were

with
madness
and
leaping

terror
they
bore
their
riders
into
the
rushing
flood
Their
piercing
cries
were
drowned
the
roaring
the
river
carried
them
away
Then
Frodo
felt
himself
falling

the
roaring
and
confusion
seemed

Frodo
woke
and
found
himself
lying

first
thought
that
had
slept
late
after
long
unpleasant
dream
that
still
hovered
the
edge
memory
perhaps
had
been

But
the
ceiling
looked
strange
was
flat
and
had
dark
beams
richly
carved
lay

while

looking

Yes
said
here
And
you
are
lucky
here
too
after

the
absurd
things
you
have
done
since
you
left

Frodo

down
again

too
comfortable
and
peaceful

and
any

did
not
think

the
better
argument

fully
awake
now
and
the
memory
his

was
returning

disastrous
short
cut
through
the
Old
Forest
the
accident
The
Prancing
Pony
and
his
madness
put
ting
the
Ring
the
dell
under
Weathertop
While
was
thinking
all
these
things
and
trying
vain
bring
his
memory
down
his
arriving
Rivendell
there
was
long
silence
broken
only
the
soft
puffs
Gandalf
pipe
blew
white

out

Where
Sam
Frodo
asked

And
are
the

all

Yes
they
are
all
safe

answered
Gandalf
Sam
was
here
until
sent
him
off

some
rest
about
half
hour
ago
What
happened

said
Frodo
all
seemed

still

Gandalf
The

was
overcoming
you

few
more
hours
and
you
would
have
been
beyond
our
aid
But
you
have
some
strength
you
dear

you
showed
the

That
was

and
perhaps
the
most
dangerous
moment
all
wish

THE
LORD
THE

and
afterwards
there
were
other
things
think
about
How
you
know
about
You
have
talked
long
your
sleep
Frodo
said
Gandalf
gently
and
has
not
been
hard
for
read
your
mind
and
memory
not
worry
Though
said
absurd
just
now
did
not
mean
think
well
you
and
the
others
small
feat
have
come
far
and
through
such
dangers
still
bearing
the

should
never
have
done
without
Strider
said
Frodo
But
needed
you
did
not
know
what
without
you
was
delayed
said
Gandalf
and
that
nearly
proved
our
ruin
And
yet
not
sure
may
have
been
better
wish
you
would
tell
what
happened
All
good
time
You
are
not
supposed
talk
worry
about
anything
today
Elrond
orders
But
talking
would
stop
thinking
and
wondering
which
are
quite
tiring
said
Frodo
wide
awake
now
and
remember
many
things
that
want
explaining
Why
were
you
delayed
You
ought
tell
that
least
You
will
soon
hear
all
you
wish
know
said
Gandalf
shall
have
Council
soon
you
are
well
enough
the
moment
will
only
say
that
was
held
captive
You
cried
Frodo
Yes
Gandalf
the

said
the
wizard
solemnly
There
are
many
powers
the

for
good
for
evil
Some
are
greater
than
Against
some
have
not
yet
been
measured
But
time
coming
The
Morgul
lord
and
his
Black

have
come
forth

Then
you
knew
the

already
before
met
them
Yes
knew
them
Indeed
spoke
them
once
you
for
the
Black

are
the

the

the

But
did

must

the

have
been

from

Aragorn
Yes
said
Frodo
was
Strider
that
saved
Yet
was
afraid
him
first
Sam
never
quite
trusted
him

not

Strider
Well
fond
not
the
right
word

dear
though

and
grim
times

reminds
often
you
didn

that
any

Only

Gandalf

Frodo

They

You
have
talked
and
reckoned
more
than
good
for
you
said
Gandalf
How
the
side
and
shoulder
feel
now
don
know
Frodo
answered
They
don
feel
all
which
improvement
but
made
effort
can
move

Yes

Good
said
Gandalf

fast
You
will
soon
sound
again
Elrond
has
cured
you
has
tended
you
for
days
ever
since
you
were
brought
Days
said
Frodo
Well
four
nights
and
three
days
exact
The
Elves
brought
you
from
the
Ford
the
night
the
twentieth
and
that
where
you
lost
count
have
been
terribly
anxious
and
Sam
has
hardly
left
your
side
day
night
except
run
messages
Elrond
master
healing
but
the
weapons
our
Enemy
are
deadly
tell
you
the
truth
had
very
little
hope
for
suspected
that
there
was
some
fragment
the
blade
still
the
closed
wound
But
could
not
found
until
last
night
Then
Elrond
removed
splinter
was
deeply
buried
and
was
working
inwards
222
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Frodo
shuddered
remembering
the
cruel
knife
with
notched
blade
that
had
vanished
Strider
hands
Don
alarmed
said
Gandalf
gone
now
has
been
melted
And
seems
that
Hobbits
fade
very
reluctantly
have
known
strong
warriors
the
Big
People
who
would
quickly
have
been
overcome
that
splinter
which
you
bore
for
seventeen
days
What
would
they
have
done
asked
Frodo
What
were
the
Riders
trying
They
tried
pierce
your
heart
with
Morgul
knife
which
remains
the
wound
they
had
succeeded
you
would
have
become
like
they
are
only
weaker
and
under
their
command
You
would
have
become
wraith
under
the
dominion
the
Dark
Lord
and
would
have
tormented
you
for
trying
keep
his
Ring
any
greater
torment
were
possible
than
being
robbed
and
seeing
his
hand
Thank
goodness
did
not
realize
the
horrible
danger
said
Frodo
faintly
was
mortally
afraid
course
but
had
known
more
should
not
have
dared
even
move
marvel
that
escaped
Yes
fortune
fate
have
helped
you
said
Gandalf
not
men
tion
courage
For
your
heart
was
not
touched
and
only
your
shoulder
was
pierced
and
that
was
because
you
resisted
the
last
But
was
terribly
narrow
shave
speak
You
were
gravest
peril
while
you
wore
the
Ring
for
then
you
were
half
the
wraith
world
yourself
and
they
might
have
seized
you
You
could
see
them
and
they
could
see
you
know
said
Frodo
They
were
terrible
behold
But
why
could
all
see
their
horses
Because
they
are
real
horses
just
the
black
robes
are
real
robes
that
they
wear
give
shape
their
nothingness
when
they
have
dealings
with
the
living
Then
why
these
black
horses
endure
such
riders
All
other
animals
are
terrified
when
they
draw
near
even
the
elf
horse
Glorfindel
The
dogs
howl
and
the
geese
scream
them
Because
these
horses
are
born
and
bred
the
service
the
Dark
Lord
Mordor
Not
all
his
servants
and
chattels
are
wraiths
There
are
orcs
and
trolls
there
are
wargs
and
werewolves
and
there
have
been
and
still
are
many
Men
warriors
and
kings
that
walk
alive
under
the
Sun
and
yet
are
under
his
sway
And
their
number
growing
daily
What
about
Rivendell
and
the
Elves
Rivendell
safe
Yes
present
until
all
else
conquered
The
Elves
may
fear
the
Dark
Lord
and
they
may
fly
before
him
but
never
again
will
they
listen
him
serve
him
And
here
Rivendell
there
live
still
some
his
chief
foes
the
Elven
wise
lords
the
Eldar
from
beyond
the
furthest
seas
They
not
fear
the
Ringwraiths
for
those
who
MANY
MEETINGS
223
have
dwelt
the
Blessed
Realm
live
once
both
worlds
and
against
both
the
Seen
and
the
Unseen
they
have
great
power
thought
that
saw
white
figure
that
shone
and
did
not
grow
dim
like
the
others
Was
that
Glorfindel
then
Yes
you
saw
him
for
moment
upon
the
other
side
one
the
mighty
the
Firstborn
Elf
lord
house
princes
Indeed
there
power
Rivendell
withstand
the
might
Mordor
for
while
and
elsewhere
other
powers
still
dwell
There
power
too
another
kind
the
Shire
But
all
such
places
will
soon
become
islands
under
siege
things
they
are
going
The
Dark
Lord
putting
forth
all
his
strength
Still
said
standing
suddenly
and
sticking
out
his
chin
while
his
beard
went
stiff
and
straight
like
bristling
wire
must
keep
our
courage
You
will
soon
well
not
talk
you
death
You
are
Rivendell
and
you
need
not
worry
about
anything
for
the
present
haven
any
courage
keep
said
Frodo
but
not
worried
the
moment
Just
give
news
friends
and
tell
the
end
the
affair
the
Ford
keep
asking
and
shall
content
for
the
present
After
that
shall
have
another
sleep
think
but
shan
able
close
eyes
until
you
have
finished
the
story
for
Gandalf
moved
his
chair
the
bedside
and
took
good
look
Frodo
The
colour
had
come
back
his
face
and
his
eyes
were
clear
and
fully
awake
and
aware
was
smiling
and
there
seemed
little
wrong
with
him
But
the
wizard
eye
there
was
faint
change
just
hint
were
transparency
about
him
and
especi
ally
about
the
left
hand
that
lay
outside
upon
the
coverlet
Still
that
must
expected
said
Gandalf
himself
not
half
through
yet
and
what
will
come
the
end
not
even
Elrond
can
foretell
Not
evil
think
may
become
like
glass
filled
with
clear
light
for
eyes
see
that
can
You
look
splendid
said
aloud
will
risk
brief
tale
without
consulting
Elrond
But
quite
brief
mind
you
and
then
you
must
sleep
again
This
what
happened
far
can
gather
The
Riders
made
straight
for
you
soon
you
fled
They
did
not
need
the
guidance
their
horses
any
longer
you
had
become
visible
them
being
already
the
threshold
their
world
And
also
the
Ring
drew
them
Your
friends
sprang
aside
off
the
road
they
would
have
been
ridden
down
They
knew
that
nothing
could
save
you
the
white
horse
could
not
The
Riders
were
too
swift
overtake
and
too
many
oppose
foot
even
Glorfindel
and
Aragorn
together
could
not
withstand
all
the
Nine
once
When
the
Ringwraiths
swept
your
friends
ran
behind
224
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Close
the
Ford
there
small
hollow
beside
the
road
masked
few
stunted
trees
There
they
hastily
kindled
fire
for
Glorfindel
knew
that
flood
would
come
down
the
Riders
tried
cross
and
then
would
have
deal
with
any
that
were
left
his
side
the
river
The
moment
the
flood
appeared
rushed
out
followed
Aragorn
and
the
others
with
flaming
brands
Caught
between
fire
and
water
and
seeing
Elf
lord
revealed
his
wrath
they
were
dismayed
and
their
horses
were
stricken
with
madness
Three
were
carried
away
the
first
assault
the
flood
the
others
were
now
hurled
into
the
water
their
horses
and
overwhelmed
And
that
the
end
the
Black
Riders
asked
Frodo
said
Gandalf
Their
horses
must
have
perished
and
without
them
they
are
crippled
But
the
Ringwraiths
themselves
cannot
easily
destroyed
However
there
nothing
more
fear
from
them
present
Your
friends
crossed
after
the
flood
had
passed
and
they
found
you
lying
your
face
the
top
the
bank
with
broken
sword
under
you
The
horse
was
standing
guard
beside
you
You
were
pale
and
cold
and
they
feared
that
you
were
dead
worse
Elrond
folk
met
them
carrying
you
slowly
towards
Rivendell
Who
made
the
flood
asked
Frodo
Elrond
commanded
answered
Gandalf
The
river
this
valley
under
his
power
and
will
rise
anger
when
has
great
need
bar
the
Ford
soon
the
captain
the
Ringwraiths
rode
into
the
water
the
flood
was
released
may
say
added
few
touches
own
you
may
not
have
noticed
but
some
the
waves
took
the
form
great
white
horses
with
shining
white
riders
and
there
were
many
rolling
and
grinding
boulders
For
moment
was
afraid
that
had
let
loose
too
fierce
wrath
and
the
flood
would
get
out
hand
and
wash
you
all
away
There
great
vigour
the
waters
that
come
down
from
the
snows
the
Misty
Mountains
Yes
all
comes
back
now
said
Frodo
the
tremendous
roaring
thought
was
drowning
with
friends
and
enemies
and
all
But
now
are
safe
Gandalf
looked
quickly
Frodo
but
had
shut
his
eyes
Yes
you
are
all
safe
for
the
present
Soon
there
will
feasting
and
merry
making
celebrate
the
victory
the
Ford
Bruinen
and
you
will
all
there
places
honour
Splendid
said
Frodo
wonderful
that
Elrond
and
Glorfindel
and
such
great
lords
not
mention
Strider
should
take
much
trouble
and
show
much
kindness
Well
there
are
many
reasons
why
they
should
said
Gandalf
smiling
one
good
reason
The
Ring
another
you
are
the
Ring
bearer
And
you
are
the
heir
Bilbo
the
Ring
finder
Dear
Bilbo
said
Frodo
sleepily
wonder
where
wish
MANY
MEETINGS
225
was
here
and
could
hear
all
about
would
have
made
him
laugh
The
cow
jumped
over
the
Moon
And
the
poor
old
troll
With
that
fell
fast
asleep
Frodo
was
now
safe
the
Last
Homely
House
east
the
Sea
That
house
was
Bilbo
had
long
ago
reported
perfect
house
whether
you
like
food
sleep
story
telling
singing
just
sitting
and
thinking
best
pleasant
mixture
them
all
Merely
there
was
cure
for
weariness
fear
and
sadness
the
evening
drew
Frodo
woke
again
and
found
that
longer
felt
need
rest
sleep
but
had
mind
for
food
and
drink
and
probably
for
singing
and
story
telling
afterwards
got
out
bed
and
discovered
that
his
arm
was
already
nearly
useful
again
ever
had
been
found
laid
ready
clean
garments
green
cloth
that
fitted
him
excellently
Looking
mirror
was
startled
see
much
thinner
reflection
himself
than
remembered
looked
remarkably
like
the
young
nephew
Bilbo
who
used
tramping
with
his
uncle
the
Shire
but
the
eyes
looked
out
him
thoughtfully
Yes
you
have
seen
thing
two
since
you
last
peeped
out
looking
glass
said
his
reflection
But
now
for
merry
meeting
stretched
out
his
arms
and
whistled
tune
that
moment
there
was
knock
the
door
and
Sam
came
ran
Frodo
and
took
his
left
hand
awkwardly
and
shyly
stroked
gently
and
then
blushed
and
turned
hastily
away
Hullo
Sam
said
Frodo
warm
said
Sam
Meaning
your
hand
Frodo
has
felt
cold
through
the
long
nights
But

cried

and

Gandalf

Sam

Always

And
Elves

Elves

Some

And
the

and
the

here
But
getting

said
Frodo
taking
his

But
you
shall
merry
tonight
and
listen

Come

Frodo

THE
LORD

RINGS
Sam
led
him
along
several
passages
and
down
many
steps
and
out
into
high
garden
above
the
steep
bank
the
river
found
his
friends
sitting
porch
the
side
the
house
looking
east
Shadows
had
fallen
the
valley
below
but
there
was
still
light
the
faces
the
mountains
far
above
The
air
was
warm
The
sound
running
and
falling
water
was
loud
and
the
evening
was
filled
with
faint
scent
trees
and
flowers
summer
still
lingered
Elrond
gardens
Hurray
cried
Pippin
springing
Here
our
noble
cousin
Make
way
for
Frodo
Lord
the
Ring
Hush
said
Gandalf
from
the
shadows
the
back
the
porch
Evil
things
not
come
into
this
valley
but
all
the
same
should
not
name
them
The
Lord

Ring
not
Frodo
but
the
master
the
Dark
Tower
Mordor
whose
power
again
stretching
out
over
the
world
are
sitting
fortress
Outside
getting
dark
Gandalf
has
been
saying
many
cheerful
things
like
that
said
Pippin
thinks
need
keeping
order
But
seems
impossible
somehow
feel
gloomy
depressed
this
place
feel
could
sing
knew
the
right
song
for
the
occasion
feel
like
singing
myself
laughed
Frodo
Though
the
moment
feel
more
like
eating
and
drinking
That
will
soon
cured
said
Pippin
You
have
shown
your
usual
cunning
getting
just
time
for
meal
More
than
meal
feast
said
Merry
soon
Gandalf
reported
that
you
were
recovered
the
preparations
began
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
they
were
summoned
the
hall
the
ringing
many
bells
The
hall
Elrond
house
was
filled
with
folk
Elves
for
the
most
part
though
there
were
few
guests
other
sorts
Elrond
was
his
custom
sat
great
chair
the
end
the
long
table
upon
the
dais
and
next
him
the
one
side
sat
Glorfindel
the
other
side
sat
Gandalf
Frodo
looked
them
wonder
for
had
never
before
seen
Elrond
whom
many
tales
spoke
and
they
sat
upon
his
right
hand
and
his
left
Glorfindel
and
even
Gandalf
whom
thought
knew
well
were
revealed
lords
dignity
and
power
Gandalf
was
shorter
stature
than
the
other
two
but
his
long
white
hair
his
sweeping
silver
beard
and
his
broad
shoulders
made
him
look
like
some
wise
king
ancient
legend
his
aged
face
under
great
snowy
brows
his
dark
eyes
were
set
like
coals
that
could
leap
suddenly
into
fire
Glorfindel
was
tall
and
straight
his
hair
was
shining
gold
his
face
fair
and
young
and
fearless
and
full
joy
his
eyes
were
bright

and
keen
and
his
voice
like
music
his
brow
sat
wisdom
and
his
hand
was
strength
The
face
Elrond
was
ageless
neither
old
nor
young
though
was
written
the
memory
many
things
both
glad
and
sorrowful
His
hair
was
dark
the
shadows
twilight
and
upon
was
set
circlet
silver
his
eyes
were
grey
clear
evening
and
them
was
light
like
the
light
stars
Venerable
seemed
king
crowned
with
many
winters
and

and
Men

the
table
against
the
woven
cloths
upon
the
wall
there
was
chair
under
canopy
and
there
sat
lady
fair
look
upon
and
like
was
she
form
womanhood
Elrond
that
Frodo
guessed
that
she
was
one
his
close
kindred
Young
she
was
and
yet
not
The
braids
her
dark
hair
were
touched
frost
her
white
arms
and
clear
face
were
flawless
and
smooth
and
the
light
stars
was
her
bright
eyes
grey
cloudless
night
yet
queenly
she
looked
and
thought
and
knowledge
were
her
glance
one
who
has
known
many
things
that
the
years
bring
Above
her
brow
her
head
was
covered
with
cap
silver

netted
with
small
gems
glittering
white
but
her
soft
grey
raiment
had
ornament
save

was
that
Frodo
saw
her
whom
few
mortals
had
yet
seen
Arwen
daughter
Elrond
whom
was
said
that
the
likeness
Luthien
had
come
earth
again
and
she
was
called
Undomiel
for
she
was
the
Evenstar
her
people
Long
she
had
been
the

her
mother

Lorien
beyond
the
mountains
and
was
but
lately
returned
Rivendell
her
father

But
her
brothers
Elladan
and
Elrohir
were
out
upon
errantry
for
they
rode
often
far
afield
with
the
Rangers
the
North
forgetting
never
their
mother
torment
the
dens
the
orcs
Such
loveliness
living
thing
Frodo
had
never
seen
before
nor
imagined
his
mind
and
was
both
surprised
and
abashed
find
that
had
seat
Elrond
table
among
all
these
folk
high
and
fair
Though
had
suitable
chair
and
was
raised
upon
several
cushions
felt
very
small
and
rather
out
place
but
that
feeling
quickly
passed
The
feast
was
merry
and
the
food
all
that
his
hunger
could
desire
was
some
time
before
looked
about
him
again
even
turned
his
neighbours
looked
first
for
his
friends
Sam
had
begged
allowed
wait
his
master
but
had
been
told
that
for
this
time
was
guest
honour
Frodo
could
see
him
now
sitting
with
Pippin
and
Merry
the
upper
end
one
the
side
tables
close
the
dais
could
see

THE
LORD

RINGS
Next
Frodo
his
right
sat
dwarf
important
appearance
richly
dressed
His
beard
very
long
and
forked
was
white
nearly
white
the
snow
white
cloth
his
garments
wore
silver
belt
and
round
his
neck
hung
chain
silver
and
diamonds
Frodo
stopped
eating
look
him
Welcome
and
well
met
said
the
dwarf
turning
towards
him
Then
actually
rose
from
his
seat
and
bowed
Gloin
your
service
said
and
bowed
still
lower
Frodo
Baggins
your
service
and
your
family
said
Frodo
correctly
rising
surprise
and
scattering
his
cushions
right
guessing
that
you
are
the
Gloin
one
the
twelve
companions
the
great
Thorin
Oakenshield
Quite
right
answered
the
dwarf
gathering
the
cushions
and
courteously
assisting
Frodo
back
into
his
seat
And
not
ask
for
have
already
been
told
that
you
are
the
kinsman
and
adopted
heir
our
friend
Bilbo
the
renowned
Allow
congratulate
you
your
recovery
Thank
you
very
much
said
Frodo
You
have
had
some
very
strange
adventures
hear
said
Gloin
wonder
greatly
what
brings
four
hobbits
long
journey
Nothing
like
has
happened
since
Bilbo
came
with
But
perhaps
should
not
inquire
too
closely
since
Elrond
and
Gandalf
not
seem
disposed
talk
this
think
will
not
speak
least
not
yet
said
Frodo
politely
guessed
that
even
Elrond
house
the
matter
the
Ring
was
not
one
for
casual
talk
and
any
case
wished
forget
his
troubles
for
time
But
equally
curious
added
learn
what
brings
important
dwarf
far
from
the
Lonely
Mountain
Gloin
looked
him
you
have
not
heard
think
will
not
speak
yet
that
either
Master
Elrond
will
summon
all
ere
long
believe
and
then
shall
all
hear
many
things
But
there
much
else
that
may
told
Throughout
the
rest
the
meal
they
talked
together
but
Frodo
listened
more
than
spoke
for
the
news
the
Shire
apart
from
the
Ring
seemed
small
and
far
away
and
unimportant
while
Gldoin
had
much
tell
events
the
northern
regions
Wilderland
Frodo
learned
that
Grimbeorn
the
Old
son
Beorn
was
now
the
lord
many
sturdy
men
and
their
land
between
the
Mountains
and
Mirkwood
neither
orc
nor
wolf
dared
Indeed
said
Gloin
were
not
for
the
Beornings
the
passage
from
Dale
Rivendell
would
long
ago
have
become
impossible
They
are
valiant
men
and
keep
open
the
High
Pass
and
the
Ford
Carrock
But
their
tolls
are
high
added
with
shake
his
head
and
like
Beorn
old
they
are
not
over
fond
dwarves
Still
they
MANY
MEETINGS
229
are
trusty
and
that
much
these
days
Nowhere
are
there
any
men
friendly
the
Men
Dale
They
are
good
folk
the
Bardings
The
grandson
Bard
the
Bowman
rules
them
Brand
son
Bain
son
Bard
strong
king
and
his
realm
now
reaches
far
south
and
east
Esgaroth
And
what
your
own
people
asked
Frodo
There
much
tell
good
and
bad
said
Gloin
yet
mostly
good
have
far
been
fortunate
though
not
escape
the
shadow
these
times
you
really
wish
hear
will
tell
you
tidings
gladly
But
stop
when
you
are
weary
Dwarves
tongues
run
when
speaking
their
handiwork
they
say
And
with
that
Gloin
embarked
long
account
the
doings
the
Dwarf
kingdom
was
delighted
have
found
polite
listener
for
Frodo
showed
sign
weariness
and
made
attempt
change
the
subject
though
actually
soon
got
rather
lost
among
the
strange
names
people
and
places
that
had
never
heard
before
was
interested
however
hear
that
Dain
was
still
King
under
the
Mountain
and
was
now
old
having
passed
his
two
hundred
and
fiftieth
year
venerable
and
fabulously
rich
the
ten
companions
who
had
survived
the
Battle
Five
Armies
seven
were
still
with
him
Dwalin
Gloin
Dori
Nori
Bifur
Bofur
and
Bombur
Bombur
was
now
fat
that
could
not
move
himself
from
his
couch
his
chair
table
and
took
six
young
dwarves
lift
him
And
what
has
become
Balin
and
Ori
and
Oin
asked
Frodo
shadow
passed
over
Gldin
face
not
know
answered
largely
account
Balin
that
have
come
ask
the
advice
those
that
dwell
Rivendell
But
tonight
let
speak
merrier
things
Gloin
began
then
talk
the
works
his
people
telling
Frodo
about
their
great
labours
Dale
and
under
the
Mountain
have
done
well
said
But
metal
work
cannot
rival
our
fathers
many
whose
secrets
are
lost
make
good
armour
and
keen
swords
but
cannot
again
make
mail
blade
match
those
that
were
made
before
the
dragon
came
Only
mining
and
building
have
surpassed
the
old
days
You
should
see
the
waterways
Dale
Frodo
and
the
fountains
and
the
pools
You
should
see
the
stone
paved
roads
many
colours
And
the
halls
and
cavernous
streets
under
the
earth
with
arches
carved
like
trees
and
the
terraces
and
towers
upon
the
Mountain
sides
Then
you
would
see
that
have
not
been
idle
will
come
and
see
them
ever
can
said
Frodo
How
surprised
Bilbo
would
have
been
see
all
the
changes
the
Desolation
Smaug
230
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Gloin
looked
Frodo
and
smiled
You
were
very
fond
Bilbo
were
you
not
asked
Yes
answered
Frodo
would
rather
see
him
than
all
the
towers
and
palaces
the
world
length
the
feast
came
end
Elrond
and
Arwen
rose
and
went
down
the
hall
and
the
company
followed
them
due
order
The
doors
were
thrown
open
and
they
went
across
wide
passage
and
through
other
doors
and
came
into
further
hall
were
tables
but
bright
fire
was
burning
great
hearth
between
the
carven
pillars
upon
either
side
Frodo
found
himself
walking
with
Gandalf
This
the
Hall
Fire
said
the
wizard
Here
you
will
hear
many
songs
and
tales
you
can
keep
awake
But
except
high
days
usually
stands
empty
and
quiet
and
people
come
here
who
wish
for
peace
and
thought
There
always
fire
here
all
the
year
round
but
there
little
other
light
Elrond
entered
and
went
towards
the
seat
prepared
for
him
Elvish
minstrels
began
make
sweet
music
Slowly
the
hall
filled
and
Frodo
looked
with
delight
upon
the
many
fair
faces
that
were
gathered
together
the
golden
firelight
played
upon
them
and
shim
mered
their
hair
Suddenly
noticed
not
far
from
the
further
end
the
fire
small
dark
figure
seated
stool
with
his
back
propped
against
pillar
Beside
him
the
ground
was
drinking
cup
and
some
bread
Frodo
wondered
whether
was
ill
people
were
ever
ill
Rivendell
and
had
been
unable
come
the
feast
His
head
seemed
sunk
sleep
his
breast
and
fold
his
dark
cloak
was
drawn
over
his
face
Elrond
went
forward
and
stood
beside
the
silent
figure
Awake
little
master
said
with
smile
Then
turning
Frodo
beckoned
him
Now
last
the
hour
has
come
that
you
have
wished
for
Frodo
said
Here
friend
that
you
have
long
missed
The
dark
figure
raised
its
head
and
uncovered
its
face
Bilbo
cried
Frodo
with
sudden
recognition
and
sprang
forward
Hullo
Frodo
lad
said
Bilbo
you
have
got
here
last
hoped
you
would
manage
Well
well
all
this
feasting
your
honour
hear
hope
you
enjoyed
yourself
Why
weren
you
there
cried
Frodo
And
why
haven
been
allowed
see
you
before
Because
you
were
asleep
have
seen
good
deal
you
have
sat
your
side
with
Sam
each
day
But
for
the
feast
don
for
such
things
much
now
And
had
something
else
MANY
MEETINGS
231
What
were
you
doing
Why
sitting
and
thinking
lot
that
nowadays
and
this
the
best
place
rule
Wake
indeed
said
cocking
eye
Elrond
There
was
bright
twinkle
and
sign
sleepiness
that
Frodo
could
see
Wake
was
not
asleep
Master
Elrond
you
want
know
you
have
all
come
out
from
your
feast
too
soon
and
you
have
disturbed
the
middle
making
song
was
stuck
over
line
two
and
was
thinking
about
them
but
now
don
suppose
shall
ever
get
them
right
There
will
such
deal
singing
that
the
ideas
will
driven
clean
out
head
shall
have
get
friend
the
Dunadan
help
Where
Elrond
laughed
shall
found
said
Then
you
two
shall
into
corner
and
finish
your
task
and
will
hear
and
judge
before
end
our
merrymaking
Messengers
were
sent
find
Bilbo
friend
though
none
knew
where
was
why
had
not
been
present
the
feast
the
meanwhile
Frodo
and
Bilbo
sat
side
side
and
Sam
came
quickly
and
placed
himself
near
them
They
talked
together
soft
voices
oblivious
the
mirth
and
music
the
hall
about
them
Bilbo
had
not
much
say
himself
When
had
left
Hobbiton
had
wandered
off
aimlessly
along
the
Road
the
country
either
side
but
somehow
had
steered
all
the
time
towards
Rivendell
got
here
without
much
adventure
said
and
after
rest
went
with
the
dwarves
Dale
last
journey
shan
travel
again
Old
Balin
had
gone
away
Then
came
back
here
and
here
have
been
have
done
this
and
that
have
written
some
more
book
And
course
make
few
songs
They
sing
them
occasionally
just
please
think
for
course
they
aren
really
good
enough
for
Rivendell
And
listen
and
think
Time
doesn
seem
pass
here
just
remarkable
place
altogether
hear
all
kinds
news
from
over
the
Mountains
and
out
the
South
but
hardly
anything
from
the
Shire
heard
about
the
Ring
course
Gandalf
has
been
here
often
Not
that
has
told
great
deal
has
become
closer
than
ever
these
last
few
years
The
Dunadan
has
told
more
Fancy
that
ring
mine
causing
such
disturbance
pity
that
Gandalf
did
not
find
out
more
sooner
could
have
brought
the
thing
here
myself
long
ago
without
much
trouble
have
thought
several
times
going
back
Hobbiton
for
but
getting
old
and
they
would
not
let
Gandalf
and
Elrond
mean
They
seemed
think
that
the
Enemy
was
looking
high
and
low
for
and
would
make
mincemeat
caught
tottering
about
the
Wild
232
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
And
Gandalf
said
The
Ring
has
passed
Bilbo
would
good
you
others
you
tried
meddle
with
again
Odd
sort
remark
just
like
Gandalf
But
said
was
looking
after
you
let
things
frightfully
glad
see
you
safe
and
sound
paused
and
looked
Frodo
doubtfully
Have
you
got
here
asked
whisper
can
help
feeling
curious
you
know
after
all
heard
should
very
much
like
just
peep
again
Yes
got
answered
Frodo
feeling
strange
reluctance
looks
just
the
same
ever
did
Well
should
just
like
see
for
moment
said
Bilbo
When
had
dressed
Frodo
found
that
while
slept
the
Ring
had
been
hung
about
his
neck
new
chain
light
but
strong
Slowly
drew
out
Bilbo
put
out
his
hand
But
Frodo
quickly
drew
back
the
Ring
his
distress
and
amazement
found
that
was
longer
looking
Bilbo
shadow
seemed
have
fallen
between
them
and
through
found
himself
eyeing
little
wrinkled
creature
with
hungry
face
and
bony
groping
hands
felt
desire
strike
him
The
music
and
singing
round
them
seemed
falter
and
silence
fell
Bilbo
looked
quickly
Frodo
face
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
understand
now
said
Put
away
sorry
sorry
you
have
come
for
this
burden
sorry
about
everything
Don
adventures
ever
have
end
suppose
not
Someone
else
always
has
carry
the
story
Well
can
helped
wonder
any
good
trying
finish
book
But
don
let
worry
about
now
let
have
some
real
News
Tell
all
about
the
Shire
Frodo
hid
the
Ring
away
and
the
shadow
passed
leaving
hardly
shred
memory
The
light
and
music
Rivendell
was
about
him
again
Bilbo
smiled
and
laughed
happily
Every
item
news
from
the
Shire
that
Frodo
could
tell
aided
and
corrected
now
and
again
Sam
was
the
greatest
interest
him
from
the
felling
the
least
tree
the
pranks
the
smallest
child
Hobbiton
They
were
deep
the
doings
the
Four
Farthings
that
they
did
not
notice
the
arrival
man
clad
dark
green
cloth
For
many
minutes
stood
looking
down
them
with
smile
Suddenly
Bilbo
looked
there
you
are
last
Dunadan
cried
Strider
said
Frodo
You
seem
have
lot
names
Well
Strider
one
that
haven
heard
before
anyway
said
Bilbo
What
you
call
him
that
for
They
call
that
Bree
said
Strider
laughing
and
that
how
was
introduced
him
MANY
MEETINGS
233
And
why
you
call
him
Dunadan
asked
Frodo
The
Dunadan
said
Bilbo
often
called
that
here
But
thought
you
knew
enough
Elvish
least
know
dun
adan
Man
the
West
Numenorean
But
this
not
the
time
for
lessons
turned
Strider
Where
have
you
been
friend
Why
weren
you
the
feast
The
Lady
Arwen
was
there
Strider
looked
down
Bilbo
gravely
know
said
But
often
must
put
mirth
aside
Elladan
and
Elrohir
have
returned
out
the
Wild
unlooked
for
and
they
had
tidings
that
wished
hear
once
Well
dear
fellow
said
Bilbo
now
you
heard
the
news
can
you
spare
moment
want
your
help
something
urgent
Elrond
says
this
song
mine
finished
before
the
end
the
evening
and
stuck
Let
off
into
corner
and
polish
Strider
smiled
Come
then
said
Let
hear
Frodo
was
left
himself
for
while
for
Sam
had
fallen
asleep
was
alone
and
felt
rather
forlorn
although
all
about
him
the
folk
Rivendell
were
gathered
But
those
near
him
were
silent
intent
upon
the
music
the
voices
and
the
instruments
and
they
gave
heed
anything
else
Frodo
began
listen
first
the
beauty
the
melodies
and
the
interwoven
words
elven
tongues
even
though
understood
them
little
held
him
spell
soon
began
attend
them
Almost
seemed
that
the
words
took
shape
and
visions
far
lands
and
bright
things
that
had
never
yet
imagined
opened
out
before
him
and
the
firelit
hall
became
like
golden
mist
above
seas
foam
that
sighed
upon
the
margins
the
world
Then
the
enchantment
became
more
and
more
dreamlike
until
felt
that
endless
river
swelling
gold
and
silver
was
flowing
over
him
too
multitudinous
for
its
pattern
comprehended
became
part
the
throbbing
air
about
him
and
drenched
and
drowned
him
Swiftly
sank
under
its
shining
weight
into
deep
realm
sleep
There
wandered
long
dream
music
that
turned
into
running
water
and
then
suddenly
into
voice
seemed
the
voice
Bilbo
chanting
verses
Faint
first
and
then
clearer
ran
the
words
Edrendil
was
mariner
that
tarried

MANY

Now
had
better

said

Bilbo
got
and
bowed
flattered
Lindir
said
But
would
too
tiring
repeat
all
Not
too
tiring
for
you
the
Elves
answered
laughing
You
know
you
are
never
tired
reciting
your
own
verses
But
really
cannot
answer
your
question
one
hearing
What
cried
Bilbo
You
can
tell
which
parts
were
mine
and
which
were
the
Dunadan
not
easy
for
tell
the
difference
between
two
mortals
said
the
Elf
Nonsense
Lindir
snorted
Bilbo
you
can
distinguish

Man
and
Hobbit
your
judgement
poorer
than
imagined
They
different
peas
and

Maybe

other

Lindir

But

you
said
Bilbo
sleepy
after

and
singing

you

you

got
and
came
towards
Frodo
Well
that
over
said
low
voice
went
off
better
than
expected
don
often
get
asked
for
second
hearing
What
did
you
think
not
going

and

said
Frodo
smiling
You
needn
said
Bilbo
matter
fact
was
all
mine
Except
that
Aragorn
insisted
putting
green
stone
seemed
think
important
don
know
why
Otherwise
obvi
ously
thought
the
whole
thing
rather
above
head
and
said
that
had
the
cheek
make
verses
about
Earendil
the

Elrond
was

was
right
don

said
Frodo
seemed
fit
somehow
though
can
explain
was
half
asleep
when
you
began
and
seemed
follow
from
something
that
was
dreaming
about
didn
understand
that
was
really
you
speaking
until
near
the
end
difficult
keep
awake
here
until
you
get
used
said
Bilbo
Not
that
hobbits
would
ever
acquire
quite
the
Elvish
appetite
for
music
and
poetry
and
tales
They
seem
like
them
much
food
more
They
will
going
for
long
time
yet
What
you
say

off
for
some
more
quiet

Can

This

not

Come
and
you
like

you
don
make
noise
They
got
and
withdrew
quietly
into
the
shadows
and
made
for
the
doors
Sam
they
left
behind

Frodo
halted
for
moment
looking
back
Elrond
was
his
chair
and
the
fire
was
his
face
like
summer
light
upon
the
trees
Near
him
sat
the
Lady
Arwen
his
surprise
Frodo
saw
that
Aragorn
stood
beside
her
his
dark
cloak
was
thrown
back
and
seemed
clad
elven
mail
and
star
shone
his
breast
They
spoke
together
and
then
suddenly
seemed
Frodo
that
Arwen
turned
towards
him
and
the
light
her
eyes
fell
him
from
afar
and
pierced
his
heart
stood
still
enchanted
while
the
sweet
syllables
the
Elvish
song
fell
like

blended

and

Elbereth
said
Bilbo
They
will

and

Blessed
Realm
many
times
tonight
Come
led
Frodo
back
his
own
little
room
opened
the
gardens
and
looked
south
across
the
ravine
the
Bruinen
There
they
sat
for
some
while
looking
through
the
window
the
bright
stars
above
the
steep
climbing
woods
and
talking
softly
They
spoke
more
the
small
news
the
Shire
far
away
nor
the
dark
shadows
and
perils
that
encompassed
them
but
the
fair
things
they
had
seen
the
world
together
the
Elves
the
stars
trees
and
the
gentle
fall
the
bright
year
the
woods
last
there
came
knock
the
door
Begging
your
pardon
said
Sam
putting
his
head
but
was
just
wondering
you
would
wanting
anything
And
begging
yours
Sam
Gamgee
replied
Bilbo
guess
you
mean
that
time
your
master
went
bed
Well
sir
there
Council

tomorrow
hear
and
only
got
today
for
the
first
time
Quite

Sam
laughed
Bilbo
You
can
trot
off
and
tell
Gandalf
that
has
gone
bed
Good
night
Frodo
Bless
but
has
been
good
see
you
again
There
are
folk
like
hobbits
after
all
for
real
good

getting
very
old
and
began

THE
COUNCIL
ELROND
Next
day
Frodo
woke
early
feeling
refreshed
and
well
walked
along
the
terraces
above
the
loud
flowing
Bruinen
and
watched
the
pale
cool
sun
rise
above
the
far
mountains
and
shine
down
slanting
through
the
thin
silver
mist
the
dew
upon
the
yellow
leaves
was
glimmering
and
the
woven
nets
gossamer
twinkled
every
bush
Sam
walked
beside
him
saying
nothing
but
sniffing
the
air
and
looking
every
now
and
again
with
wonder
his
eyes
the
great
heights
the
East
The
snow
was
white
upon
their
peaks
seat
cut
the
stone
beside
turn
the
path
they
came
upon
Gandalf
and
Bilbo
deep
talk
Hullo
Good
morning
said
Bilbo
Feel
ready
for
the
great
council
feel
ready
for
anything
answered
Frodo
But
most
all
should
like
walking
today
and
explore
the
valley
should
like
get
into
those
pine
woods
there
pointed
away
far
the
side
Rivendell
the
north
You
may
have
chance
later
said
Gandalf
But
cannot
make
any
plans
yet
There
much
hear
and
decide
today
Suddenly
they
were
talking
single
clear
bell
rang
out
That
the
warning
bell
for
the
Council
Elrond
cried
Gandalf
Come
along
now
Both
you
and
Bilbo
are
wanted
Frodo
and
Bilbo
followed
the
wizard
quickly
along
the
winding
path
back
the
house
behind
them
uninvited
and
for
the
moment
forgotten
trotted
Sam
Gandalf
led
them
the
porch
where
Frodo
had
found
his
friends
the
evening
before
The
light
the
clear
autumn
morning
was
now
glowing
the
valley
The
noise
bubbling
waters
came
from
the
foaming
river
bed
Birds
were
singing
and
wholesome
peace
lay
the
land
Frodo
his
dangerous
flight
and
the
rumours
the
darkness
growing
the
world
outside
already
seemed
only
the
memories
troubled
dream
but
the
faces
that
were
turned
meet
them
they
entered
were
grave
Elrond
was
there
and
several
others
were
seated
silence
about
him
Frodo
saw
Glorfindel
and
Gloin
and
corner
alone
Strider
was
sitting
clad
his
old
travel
worn
clothes
again
Elrond
drew
Frodo
seat
his
side
and
presented
him
the
company
saying
Here
friends
the
hobbit
Frodo
son
Drogo
Few
have
240
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
ever
come
hither
through
greater
peril
errand
more
urgent
then
pointed
out
and
named
those
whom
Frodo
had
not
met
before
There
was
younger
dwarf
Gloin
side
his
son
Gimli
Beside
Glorfindel
there
were
several
other
counsellors
Elrond
household
whom
Erestor
was
the
chief
and
with
him
was
Galdor
Elf
from
the
Grey
Havens
who
had
come
errand
from
Cirdan
the
Shipwright
There
was
also
strange
Elf
clad
green
and
brown
Legolas
messenger
from
his
father
Thranduil
the
King
the
Elves
Northern
Mirkwood
And
seated
little
apart
was
tall
man
with
fair
and
noble
face
dark
haired
and
grey
eyed
proud
and
stern
glance
was
cloaked
and
booted
for
journey
horseback
and
indeed
though
his
garments
were
rich
and
his
cloak
was
lined
with
fur
they
were
stained
with
long
travel
had
collar
silver
which
single
white
stone
was
set
his
locks
were
shorn
about
his
shoulders
baldric
wore
great
horn
tipped
with
silver
that
now
was
laid
upon
his
knees
gazed
Frodo
and
Bilbo
with
sudden
wonder
Here
said
Elrond
turning
Gandalf
Boromir
man
from
the
South
arrived
the
grey
morning
and
seeks
for
counsel
have
bidden
him
present
for
here
his
questions
will
answered
Not
all
that
was
spoken
and
debated
the
Council
need
now
told
Much
was
said
events
the
world
outside
especially
the
South
and
the
wide
lands
east
the
Mountains
these
things
Frodo
had
already
heard
many
rumours
but
the
tale
Gloin
was
new
him
and
when
the
dwarf
spoke
listened
attentively
appeared
that
amid
the
splendour
their
works
hand
the
hearts
the
Dwarves
the
Lonely
Mountain
were
troubled
now
many
years
ago
said
Gloin
that
shadow
disquiet
fell
upon
our
people
Whence
came
did
not
first
perceive
Words
began
whispered
secret
was
said
that
were
hemmed
narrow
place
and
that
greater
wealth
and
splendour
would
found
wider
world
Some
spoke
Moria
the
mighty
works
our
fathers
that
are
called
our
own
tongue
Khazad
dim
and
they
declared
that
now
last
had
the
power
and
numbers
return
Gloin
sighed
Moria
Moria
Wonder
the
Northern
world
Too
deep
delved
there
and
woke
the
nameless
fear
Long
have
its
vast
mansions
lain
empty
since
the
children
Durin
fled
But
now
spoke
again
with
longing
and
yet
with
dread
for
dwarf
has
dared
pass
the
doors
Khazad

for
many
lives
kings
save
Thror
only
and
perished
last
however
Balin
listened
the
THE
COUNCIL
ELROND
241
whispers
and
resolved
and
though
Dain
did
not
give
leave
willingly
took
with
him
Ori
and
Oin
and
many
our
folk
and
they
went
away
south
That
was
nigh
thirty
years
ago
For
while
had
news
and
seemed
good
messages
reported
that
Moria
had
been
entered
and
great
work
begun
there
Then
there
was
silence
and
word
has
ever
come
from
Moria
since
Then
about
year
ago
messenger
came
Dain
but
not
from
Moria
from
Mordor
horseman
the
night
who
called
Dain
his
gate
The
Lord
Sauron
the
Great
said
wished
for
our
friendship
Rings
would
give
for
such
gave
old
And
asked
urgently
concerning
hobbits
what
kind
they
were
and
where
they
dwelt
For
Sauron
knows
said
that
one
these
was
known
you
time
this
were
greatly
troubled
and
gave
answer
And
then
his
fell
voice
was
lowered
and
would
have
sweetened
could
small
token
only
your
friendship
Sauron
asks
this
said
that
you
should
find
this
thief
such
was
his
word
and
get
from
him
willing
little
ring
the
least
rings
that
once
stole
but
trifle
that
Sauron
fancies
and
earnest
your
good
will
Find
and
three
rings
that
the
Dwarf
sires
possessed
old
shall
returned
you
and
the
realm
Moria
shall
yours
for
ever
Find
only
news
the
thief
whether
still
lives
and
where
and
you
shall
have
great
reward
and
lasting
friendship
from
the
Lord
Refuse
and
things
will
not
seem
well
you
refuse
that
his
breath
came
like
the
hiss
snakes
and
all
who
stood
shuddered
but
Dain
said
say
neither
yea
nor
nay
must
consider
this
message
and
what
means
under
its
fair
cloak
Consider
well
but
not
too
long
said
The
time
thought
own
spend
answered
Dain
Ror
the
present
said
and
rode
into
the
darkness
Heavy
have
the
hearts
our
chieftains
been
since
that
night
needed
not
the
fell
voice
the
messenger
warn
that
his
words
held
both
menace
and
deceit
for
knew
already
that
the
power
that
has
entered
Mordor
has
not
changed
and
ever
betrayed
old
Twice
the
messenger
has
returned
and
has
gone
unanswered
The
third
and
last
time
says
soon
come
before
the
ending
the
year
And
have
been
sent
last
Dain
warn
Bilbo
that
sought
the
Enemy
and
learn
may
why
desires
this
ring
this
least
rings
Also
crave
the
advice
Elrond
For
the
Shadow
grows
and
draws
nearer
discover
that
messengers
have
come
also
King
Brand
Dale
and
that

fear

Already

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
make
answer
the
Enemy
may
move
Men
his
rule
assail
King
Brand
and
Dain
also
You
have
done
well
come
said
Elrond
You
will
hear
today
all
that
you
need
order
understand
the
purposes
the
Enemy
There
naught
that
you
can
other
than
resist
with
hope
without
But
you
not
stand
alone
You
will
learn
that
your
trouble
but
part
the
trouble
all
the
western
world
The
Ring
What
shall
with
the
Ring
the
least
rings
the
trifle
that
Sauron
fancies
That
the
doom
that
must
deem
That
the
purpose
for
which
you
are
called
hither
Called
say
though
have
not
called
you
strangers
from
distant
lands
You
have
come
and
are
here
met
this
very
nick
time
chance
may
seem
Yet
not
Believe
rather
that
ordered
that
who
sit
here
and
none
others
must
now
find
counsel
for
the
peril
the
world
Now
therefore
things
shall
openly
spoken
that
have
been
hidden
from
all
but
few
until
this
day
And
first
that
all
may
understand
what
the
peril
the
Tale
the
Ring
shall
told
from
the
beginning
even
this
present
And
will
begin
that
tale
though
others
shall
end
Then
all
listened
while
Elrond
his
clear
voice
spoke
Sauron
and
the
Rings
Power
and
their
forging
the
Second
Age
the
world
long
ago
part
his
tale
was
known
some
there
but
the
full
tale
none
and
many
eyes
were
turned
Elrond
fear
and
wonder
told
the
Elven
smiths
Eregion
and
their
friendship
with
Moria
and
their
eagerness
for
knowledge
which
Sauron
ensnared
them
For
that
time
was
not
yet
evil
behold
and
they
received
his
aid
and
grew
mighty
craft
whereas
learned
all
their
secrets
and
betrayed
them
and
forged
secretly
the
Moun
tain
Fire
the
One
Ring
their
master
But
Celebrimbor
was
aware
him
and
hid
the
Three
which
had
made
and
there
was
war
and
the
land
was
laid
waste
and
the
gate
Moria
was
shut
Then

For

though

the

Last

Elves

and
the
hosts
Gil

and
Elendil
were
mustered
Arnor
Thereupon
Elrond
paused
while
and
sighed
remember
well
the
splendour
their
banners
said
recalled
the
glory
the
Elder
Days
and
the
hosts
Beleriand
many
great
princes
and
captains
were
assembled
And
yet
not
many
nor
fair
when
Thangorodrim
was
broken
and
the
Elves
deemed
that
evil
was
ended
for
ever
and
was
not
You
remember
said
Frodo
speaking
his
thought
aloud
his
astonishment
But
thought
stammered
Elrond
turned
towards
him
thought
that
the
fall
Gil

long
age
ago
was
indeed
answered
Elrond
gravely
But
memory
reaches
back
even
the
Elder
Days
Earendil
was
sire
who
was
born
Gondolin
before
its
fall
and
mother
was
Elwing
daughter
Dior

seen
three
ages

and
many
defeats
and
many
fruitless

was
the
herald
Gil
galad
and
marched
with
his
host
was
the
Battle
Dagorlad
before
the
Black
Gate
Mordor
where
had
the
mastery
for
the
Spear
Gil
galad
and
the
Sword
Elendil
Aeglos
and
Narsil
none
could
withstand
beheld
the
last
combat
the
slopes
Orodruin
where
Gil
galad
died
and
Elendil
fell
and
Narsil
broke
beneath
him
but
Sauron
himself
was
overthrown
and
Isildur
cut
the
Ring
from
his
hand
with
the
hilt
shard
his
father
sword
and
took
for
his
own
this
the
stranger
Boromir
broke
that
what
became
the
Ring
cried
ever
such
tale
was
told
the
South
has
long
been
forgotten
have
heard
the
Great

him
that
not
name
but
believed
that
perished
from
the

the
ruin
his
first

Isildur
took
That
tidings
indeed
Alas
yes
said
Elrond
Isildur
took
should
not
have

should
have
been
cast
then
into
Orodruin
fire
nigh

But
few
marked
what
Isildur
did
alone
stood
his

only
Cirdan
stood

But
Isildur
would
not
listen
our

This
will
have
weregild
for

said
and
therefore
whether
would
took
treasure
But
soon
was
betrayed
his
death
and
named
the
North
Isildur
Bane
Yet
death
maybe
was
better
than
what
else
might
have
befallen
him
Only
the
North
did
these

come
and
only
few
Small
wonder
that
you
have
not
heard
them
Boromir
From
the
ruin
the
Gladden
Fields
where
Isildur
perished
three
men
only
came
ever
back
over

these
was
Ohtar

But
Narsil
was
broken
and
its

extinguished

not

been

again
Fruitless
did
call
the
victory
the
Last

Not
wholly
yet
did
not
achieve
its
end
Sauron
was
diminished
but
not
destroyed
His
Ring
was
lost
but
not
unmade
The
Dark
Tower
was
broken
but
its
foundations
were
not
removed
for
they
were
made
with
the
power
the
Ring
and
while
remains
they
will
endure
Many
Elves
and
many
mighty
Men
and
many
their
friends
had
perished
the
war
Anarion
was
slain
and
Isildur
was
slain
and
Gil
galad
and
Elendil
were
more
Never
again
shall
there
any
such
league
Elves
and
Men
for
Men
multiply
and
the
Firstborn
decrease
and
the
two
kindreds
are
estranged
And
ever
since
that
day
the
race
Numenor
has
decayed
and
the
span
their
years
has
lessened
the
North
after
the
war
and
the
slaughter
the
Gladden
Fields
the
Men
Westernesse
were
diminished
and
their

Annuminas
beside

into
ruin

and
that
now
too
desolate
Men
call

Dike
and
they
fear
tread
there
For
the

Arnor
dwindled
and
their
foes
devoured
them
and
their
lordship
passed
leaving
only
green
mounds
the
grassy
hills
the
South
the
realm
Gondor
long
endured
and
for
while
its
splendour
grew
recalling
somewhat
the
might
Numenor
ere
fell
High
towers
that
people
built
and
strong
places
and
havens
many
ships
and
the
winged
crown
the
Kings

was
held
awe
folk
many

Their
chief
city
was
Osgili
ath
Citadel
the
Stars
through
the
midst
which
the
River
flowed
And
Minas
Ithil
they
built
Tower
the
Rising

eastward
upon
shoulder
the
Mountains
Shadow
and
westward
the
feet
the
White
Mountains
Minas

they
made

There
the
courts
the
King
grew
white
tree
from
the
seed
that
tree
which
Isildur
brought
over
the
deep
waters
and
the
seed
that
tree
before
came
from
Eresséa
and
before
that

But
the

Then
the

slept
and

called

Then
Minas

was
named
anew
Minas

and
these
two

were
ever

the
Lords
Minas

still
fight
defying
our
enemies
keeping
the
passage
the

from
Argonath

And
now
that
part
the
tale
that
shall
tell
drawn
its
close
For
the
days
Isildur
the
Ruling
Ring
passed
out
all
knowledge
and
the
Three
were
released
from
its
dominion
But
now
this
latter
day
they
are

more
for
our
sorrow
the
One

been
found
Others
shall
speak
its

that

small
part
ceased
but
once
Boromir
stood
tall
and
proud
before
them
Give
leave
Master
Elrond
said
first
say
more
Gondor
for
verily
from
the
land
Gondor
come
And
would
well
for
all
know
what
passes
there
For
few
deem
know
our
deeds
and
therefore
guess
little
their
peril
should
fail
last
Believe
not
that
the
land
Gondor
the
blood
Numenor
spent
nor
all
its
pride
and
dignity
forgotten
our
valour
the
wild
folk
the
East
are
still
restrained
and
the
terror
Morgul
kept
bay
and
thus
alone
are
peace
and
freedom
maintained
the
lands
behind
bulwark
the
West
But
the
passages
the
River
should
won
what
then
Yet
that
hour
maybe
not
now
far
away
The
Nameless
Enemy
has
arisen
again
Smoke
rises
once
more
from
Orodruin
that
call
Mount
Doom
The
power
the
Black
Land
grows
and
are
hard
beset
When
the
Enemy
returned
our
folk
were
driven
from
Ithilien
our
fair
domain
east
the
River
though
kept
foothold
there
and
strength
arms
But
this
very
year
the
days
June
sudden
war
came
upon
out
Mordor
and
were
swept
away
were
outnumbered
for
Mordor
has
allied
itself
with
the
Easterlings
and
the
cruel
Haradrim
but
was
not
numbers
that
were
defeated
power
was
there
that
have
not
felt
before
Some
said
that
could
seen
like
great
black
horseman
dark
shadow
under
the
moon
Wherever
came
madness
filled
our
foes
but
fear
fell
our
boldest
that
horse
and
man
gave
way
and
fled
Only
remnant
our
eastern
force
came
back
destroying
the
last
bridge
that
still
stood
amid
the
ruins
Osgiliath
was
the
company
that
held
the
bridge
until
was
cast
down
behind
Four
only
were
saved
swimming

and
myself
and

But
still

THE

Only

But
not

The

said
come
ask
for
counsel
and
the
unravelling
hard
words
For
the
eve
the
sudden
assault
dream
came
brother
troubled
sleep
and
afterwards
like
dream
came
oft
him
again
and
once
that
dream
thought
the
eastern
sky
grew
dark
and
there
was
growing
thunder
but
the
West
pale
light
lingered
and
out
heard
voice
remote
but
clear
crying
Seek
for
the
Sword
that
was
broken
Imladris
dwells
There
shall
counsels
taken
Stronger
than
Morgul
spells
There
shall
shown

That

For

shall
waken
And
the
Halfling
forth
shall
stand
these
words
could
understand
little
and
spoke
our
father
Denethor
Lord
Minas
Tirith
wise
the
lore
Gondor
This
only
would
say
that
Imladris
was
old
the
name
among
the
Elves
far
northern
dale
where
Elrond
the
Halfelven
dwelt
greatest
lore
masters
Therefore
brother
seeing
how
desperate
was
our
need
was
eager
heed
the
dream
and
seek
for
Imladris
but
since
the
way
was
full
doubt
and
danger
took
the
journey
upon
myself
Loth
was
father
give
leave
and
long
have
wandered
roads
forgotten
seeking
the
house
Elrond
which
many
had
heard
but
few
knew
where
lay
And
here
the
house
Elrond
more
shall
made
clear
you
said
Aragorn
standing
cast
his
sword
upon
the
table
that
stood
before
Elrond
and
the
blade
was
two
pieces
Here
the
Sword
that
was
Broken
said
And
who
are
you
and
what
have
you
with
Minas
Tirith
asked
Boromir
looking
wonder
the
lean
face
the
Ranger
and
his
weather
stained
cloak
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
said
Elrond
and
descended
through
many
fathers
from
Isildur
Elendil
son
Minas
Ithil
the
Chief
the
Dunedain
the
North
and
few
are
now
left

Then
belongs
you
and
not
all
cried
Frodo
amazement
springing
his
feet
expected
the
Ring
demanded
once
does
not
belong
either
said
Aragorn
but
has
been
ordained
that
you
should
hold
for
while
Bring
out
the
Ring
Frodo
said
Gandalf
solemnly
The
time
has
come
Hold
and
then
Boromir
will
understand
the
remainder
his
riddle
There
was
hush
and
all
turned
their
eyes
Frodo
was
shaken
sudden
shame
and
fear
and
felt
great
reluctance
reveal
the
Ring
and
loathing
its
touch
wished
was
far
away
The
Ring
gleamed
and
flickered
held
before
them
his
trembling
hand
Behold
Isildur
Bane
said
Elrond
Boromir
eyes
glinted
gazed
the
golden
thing
The
Halfling
muttered
then
the
doom
Minas
Tirith
come
last
But
why
then
should
seek
broken
sword
The
words
were
not
the
doom
Minas
Tinith
said
Aragorn
But
doom
and
great
deeds
are
indeed
hand
For
the
Sword
that
was
Broken
the
Sword
Elendil
that
broke
beneath
him
when
fell
has
been
treasured
his
heirs
when
all
other
heirlooms
were
lost
for
was
spoken
old
among
that
should
made
again
when
the
Ring
Isildur
Bane
was
found
Now
you
have
seen
the
sword
that
you
have
sought
what
would
you
ask
you
wish
for
the
House
Elendil
return
the
Land
Gondor
was
not
sent
beg
any
boon
but
seek
only
the
meaning
riddle
answered
Boromir
proudly
Yet
are
hard
pressed
and
the
Sword
Elendil
would
help
beyond
our
hope
such
thing
could
indeed
return
out
the
shadows
the
past
looked
again
Aragorn
and
doubt
was
his
eyes
Frodo
felt
Bilbo
stir
impatiently
his
side
Evidently
was
annoyed
his
friend
behalf
Standing
suddenly
burst
out
All
that
gold
does
not
glitter
Not
all
those
who
wander
are
lost
The
old
that
strong
does
not
wither
Deep
roots
are
not
reached
the
frost
From
the
ashes

shall
woken

from
the
shadows
shall
spring
Renewed
shall

broken
The

THE

Not
very
good
perhaps
but
the
point
you
need
more
beyond

word
Elrond
that
was
worth

hundred
and
ten
days
hear
you
had
best

sat
down
with
snort
made
that
myself
whispered
Frodo
for
the
Dunadan
long
time
ago
when
first
told
about
himself
almost
wish
that
adventures
were
not
over
and
that
could
with
him
when
his
day
comes
Aragorn
smiled
him
then
turned
Boromir
again
For
part
forgive
your
doubt
said
Little
resemble
the
figures
Elendil
and
Isildur
they
stand
carven
their
majesty
the
halls
Denethor
but
the
heir
Isildur
not
Isildur
himself
have
had
hard
life
and
long
and
the

that
lie
between
here
and
Gondor
are
small

the

have
crossed
many
mountains
and
many
rivers
and
trodden
many
plains
even
into
the
far
countries
Rhtin
and
Harad
where
the
stars
are
strange
But
home
such
have
the
North
For
here
the
heirs
Valandil
have
ever
dwelt
long
line
unbroken
from
father
unto
son
for
many
generations
Our
days
have
darkened
and
have
dwindled
but
ever
the
Sword
has
passed

And
this
will
say
you
Boromir
ere

Lonely

You

Peace

you
say
The

would
have

Fear
would
have

But
when

things
little
better
now
Anyway
this
what
happened
some
there
Bilbo
tale
was
wholly
new
and
they
listened
with
amazement
while
the
old
hobbit
actually
not
all
displeased
recounted
his
adventure
with
Gollum
full
length
did
not
omit
single
riddle
would
have
given
also
account
his
party
and
disappearance
from
the
Shire
had
been
allowed
but
Elrond
raised
his
hand
Well
told
friend
said
but
that
enough
this
time
For
the
moment
suffices
know
that
the
Ring
passed
Frodo
your
heir
Let
him
now
speak
Then
less
willingly
than
Bilbo
Frodo
told
all
his
dealings
with
the
Ring
from
the
day
that
passed
into
his
keeping
Every
step
his
journey
from
Hobbiton
the
Ford
Bruinen
was
questioned
and
considered
and
everything
that
could
recall
concerning
the
Black
Riders
was
examined
last
sat
down
again
Not
bad
Bilbo
said
him
You
would
have
made
good
story
they
hadn
kept
interrupting
tried
make
few
notes
but
shall
have
over
all
again
together
some
time
write
There
are
whole
chapters
stuff
before
you
ever
got
here
Yes
made
quite
long
tale
answered
Frodo
But
the
story
still
does
not
seem
complete
still
want
know
good
deal
especially
about
Gandalf
Galdor
the
Havens
who
sat
nearby
overheard
him
You
speak
for
also
cried
and
turning
Elrond
said
The
Wise
may
have
good
reason
believe
that
the
halfling
trove
indeed
the

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Great
Ring
long
debate
unlikely
though
that
may
seem
those
who
know
less
But
may
not
hear
the
proofs
And
would
ask
this
also
What
Saruman
learned
the
lore
the
Rings
yet
not
among
What
his
counsel
knows
the
things
that
have
heard
The
questions
that
you
ask
Galdor
are
bound
together
said
Elrond
had
not
overlooked
them
and
they
shall
answered
But
these
things
the
part
Gandalf
make
clear
and
call
upon
him
last
for
the
place
honour
and
all
this
matter
has
been
the
chief
Some
Galdor
said
Gandalf
would
think
the
tidings
Gloin
and
the
pursuit
Frodo
proof
enough
that
the
halfling
trove
thing
great
worth
the
Enemy
Yet
ring
What
then
The
Nine
the
Nazgtl
keep
The
Seven
are
taken
destroyed
this
Gloin
stirred
but
did
not
speak
The
Three
know
What
then
this
one
that
desires
much
There
indeed
wide
waste
time
between
the
River
and
the
Mountain
between
the
loss
and
the
finding
But
the
gap
the
know
ledge
the
Wise
has
been
filled
last
Yet
too
slowly
For
the
Enemy
has
been
close
behind
closer
even
than
feared
And
well
that
not
until
this
year
this
very
summer
seems
did
learn
the
full
truth
Some
here
will
remember
that
many
years
ago
myself
dared
pass
the
doors
the
Necromancer
Dol
Guldur
and
secretly
explored
his
ways
and
found
thus
that
our
fears
were
true
was
none
other
than
Sauron
our
Enemy
old
length
taking
shape
and
power
again
Some
too
will
remember
also
that
Saruman
dis
suaded
from
open
deeds
against
him
and
for
long
watched
him
only
Yet
last
his
shadow
grew
Saruman
yielded
and
the
Council
put
forth
its
strength
and
drove
the
evil
out
Mirkwood
and
that
was
the
very
year
the
finding
this
Ring
strange
chance
chance
was
But
were
too
late
Elrond
foresaw
Sauron
also
had
watched
and
had
long
prepared
against
our
stroke
governing
Mordor
from
afar
through
Minas
Morgul
where
his
Nine
servants
dwelt
until
all
was
ready
Then
gave
way
before
but
only
feigned
flee
and
soon
after
came
the
Dark
Tower
and
openly
declared
himself
Then
for
the
last
time
the
Council
met
for
now
learned
that
was
seeking
ever
more
eagerly
for
the
One
feared
then
that
had
some
news
that
knew
nothing
But
Saruman
said
nay
and
repeated
what
had
said
before
that
the
One
would
never
again
found
Middle
earth
the
worst
said
our
Enemy
knows
that
have
not
and
that
still
lost
But
what
was
lost
may
yet
found
thinks
THE
COUNCIL
ELROND
251
Fear
not
His
hope
will
cheat
him
Have
not
earnestly
studied
this
matter
Into
Anduin
the
Great
fell
and
long
ago
while
Sauron
slept
was
rolled
down
the
River
the
Sea
There
let
lie
until
the
End
Gandalf
fell
silent
gazing
eastward
from
the
porch
the
far
peaks
the
Misty
Mountains
whose
great
roots
the
peril
the
world
had
long
lain
hidden
sighed
There
was
fault
said
was
lulled
the
words
Saruman
the
Wise
but
should
have
sought
for
the
truth
sooner
and
our
peril
would
now
less
were
all
fault
said
Elrond
and
but
for
your
vigilance
the
Darkness
maybe
would
already
upon
But
say
From
the
first
heart
misgave
against
all
reason
that
knew
said
Gandalf
and
desired
know
how
this
thing
came
Gollum
and
how
long
had
possessed
set
watch
for
him
guessing
that
would
ere
long
come
forth
from
his
darkness
seek
for
his
treasure
came
but
escaped
and
was
not
found
And
then
alas
let
the
matter
rest
watching
and
waiting
only
have
too
often
done
Time
passed
with
many
cares
until
doubts
were
awakened
again
sudden
fear
Whence
came
the
hobbit
ring
What
fear
was
true
should
done
with
Those
things
must
decide
But
spoke
yet
dread
none
knowing
the
peril
untimely
whisper
went
astray
all
the
long
wars
with
the
Dark
Tower
treason
has
ever
been
our
greatest
foe
That
was
seventeen
years
ago
Soon
became
aware
that
spies
many
sorts
even
beasts
and
birds
were
gathered
round
the
Shire
and
fear
grew
called
for
the
help
the
Dunedain
and
their
watch
was
doubled
and
opened
heart
Aragorn
the
heir
Isildur
And
said
Aragorn
counselled
that
should
hunt
for
Gollum
too
late
though
may
seem
And
since
seemed
fit
that
Isildur
heir
should
labour
repair
Isildur
fault
went
with
Gandalf
the
long
and
hopeless
search
Then
Gandalf
told
how
they
had
explored
the
whole
length
Wilderland
down
even
the
Mountains
Shadow
and
the
fences
Mordor
There
had
rumour
him
and
guess
that
dwelt
there
long
the
dark
hills
but
never
found
him
and
last
despaired
And
then
despair
thought
again
test
that
might
make
the
finding
Gollum
unneeded
The
ring
itself
might
tell
were
the
One
The
memory
words
the
Council
came
back
words
Saruman
half
heeded
the
time
heard
them
now

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
The
Nine
the
Seven
and
the
Three
said
chad
each
their
proper
gem
Not
the
One
was
round
and
unadorned
were
one
the
lesser
rings
but
its
maker
set
marks
upon
that
the
skilled
maybe
could
still
see
and
read
What
those
marks
were
had
not
said
Who
now
would
know
The
maker
And
Saruman
But
great
though
his
lore
may
must
have
source
What
hand
save
Sauron
ever
held
this
thing
ere
was
lost
The
hand
Isildur
alone
With
that
thought
forsook
the
chase
and
passed
swiftly
Gondor
former
days
the
members
order
had
been
well
received
there
but
Saruman
most
all
Often
had
been
for
long
the
guest
the
Lords
the
City
Less
welcome
did
the
Lord
Denethor
show
then
than
old
and
grudgingly
permitted
search
among
his
hoarded
scrolls
and
books
indeed
you
look
only
you
say
for
records
ancient
days
and
the
beginnings
the
City
read
said
For
what
was
less
dark
than
what
come
and
that
care
But
unless
you
have
more
skill
even
than
Saruman
who
has
studied
here
long
you
will
find
naught
that
not
well
known
who
master
the
lore
this
City
said
Denethor
And
yet
there
lie
his
hoards
many
records
that
few
even
the
lore
masters
now
can
read
for
their
scripts
and
tongues
have
become
dark

And
Boromir
there

still
unread

and

that
Isildur
made
himself
For
Isildur
did
not
march
away
straight
from
the
war
Mordor
some
have
told
the
tale
Some
the
North
maybe
Boromir
broke
All
know
Gondor
that
went
first
Minas
Anor
and
dwelt
while
with
his
nephew
Meneldil
instructing
him
before
committed
him
the
rule
the
South
Kingdom
that
time
planted
there
the
last
sapling
the
White
Tree
memory
his
brother
But
that
time
also
made
this
scroll
said
Gandalf
and
that
not
remembered
Gondor
would
seem
For
this
scroll
concerns
the
Ring
and
thus
wrote
Isildur
therein
The
Great
Ring
shall
now
heirloom
the
North
Kingdom
but
records
shall
left
Gondor
where
also
dwell
the
heirs
Elendil
lest
time
come
when
the
memory
these
great
matters
shall
grow
dim
And
after
these
words
Isildur
described
the
Ring
such
found
was
hot
when
first
took
hot
glede
and
hand
was
scorched
that
doubt
ever
again
shall
free
the
pain
Yet
THE

253
even
write
cooled
and
seemeth
shrink
though
loseth
neither
its
beauty
nor
its
shape
Already
the
writing
upon
which
first
was
clear
red
flame
fadeth
and
now
only
barely
read
fashioned
elven
script
Eregion
for
they
have
letters

for
such
subtle
work
but
the
language
unknown
deem

the
Black
Land
since
foul
and
uncouth
What
evil
saith
not
know
but
trace
here

lest
fade
beyond
recall
The
Ring
misseth
maybe
the
heat
Sauron
hand
which
was
black
and
yet
burned
lItke
fire
and
Gil

was
destroyed
and
maybe
were

the

But
for
part
will
risk
hurt
this
thing
all
the
works
Sauron
the
only
fair
precious
though
buy
with
great
pain
When
read
these
words
quest
was
ended
For
the
traced
writing
was
indeed
Isildur
guessed
the
tongue
Mordor
and
the
servants
the
Tower
And
what
was
said
therein
was
already
known
For
the
day
that
Sauron
first
put
the
One
Celebrimbor
maker
the
Three
was
aware
him
and
from
afar
heard
him
speak
these
words
and
his
evil
purposes
were
revealed
once
took
leave
Denethor
but
even
went
north
wards
messages
came
out
Lorien
that
Aragorn
had
passed
that
way
and
that
had
found
the
creature
called
Gollum
There
fore
went
first
meet
him
and
hear
his
tale
Into
what
deadly
perils
had
gone
alone
dared
not
guess
There
little
need
tell
them
said
Aragorn
man
must
needs
walk
sight
the
Black
Gate
tread
the
deadly
flowers
Morgul
Vale
then
perils
will
have
too
despaired
last
and
began
homeward
journey
And
then
fortune
came
sud
denly
what
sought
the
marks
soft
feet
beside
muddy
pool
But
now
the
trail
was
fresh
and
swift
and
led
not
Mordor
but
away
Along
the
skirts
the
Dead
Marshes
followed
and
then
had
him
Lurking
stagnant
mere
peering
the
water
the
dark
eve
fell
caught
him
Gollum
was
covered
with
green
slime
will
never
love
fear
for
bit
and
was
not
gentle
Nothing
more
did
ever
get
from
his
mouth
than
the
marks
his
teeth
deemed
the
worst
part
all
journey
the
road
back
watching
him
day
and
night
making
him
walk
before
with
halter
his
neck
gagged
until
was
tamed
lack
drink
and
food
driving
him
ever
towards
Mirkwood
brought
him
there
last
and
gave
him
the
Elves
for
had
agreed
that
this
should
done
and
was
glad
rid
his
company
for
stank
For
part
hope
never
look
upon
him
again
but
Gandalf
came
and
endured
long
speech
with
him
Yes
long
and
weary
said
Gandalf
but
not
without
profit
For
254
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
one
thing
the
tale
told
his
loss
agreed
with
that
which
Bilbo
has
now
told
openly
for
the
first
time
but
that
mattered
little
since
had
already
guessed
But
learned
then
first
that
Gollum
ring
came
out
the
Great
River
nigh
the
Gladden
Fields
And
learned
also
that
had
possessed
long
Many
lives
his
small
kind
The
power
the
ring
had
lengthened
his
years
far
beyond
their
span
but
that
power
only
the
Great
Rings
wield
And
that
not
proof
enough
Galdor
there
the
other
test
that
spoke
Upon
this
very
ring
which
you
have
here
seen
held
aloft
round
and
unadorned
the
letters
that
Isildur
reported
may
still
read
one
has
the
strength
will
set
the
golden
thing
the
fire
while
That
have
done
and
this
have
read
Ash
nazg
durbatuliik
ash
nazg
gimbatul
ash
nazg
thrakatulik
agh
burzum
ishi
krimpatul
The
change
the
wizard
voice
was
astounding
Suddenly
became
menacing
powerful
harsh
stone
shadow
seemed
pass
over
the
high
sun
and
the
porch
for
moment
grew
dark
All
trembled
and
the
Elves
stopped
their
ears
Never
before
has
any
voice
dared
utter
words
that
tongue
Imladris
Gandalf
the
Grey
said
Elrond
the
shadow
passed
and
the
company
breathed
once
more
And
let
hope
that
none
will
ever
speak
here
again
answered
Gandalf
Nonetheless
not
ask
your
pardon
Master
Elrond
For
that
tongue
not
soon
heard
every
corner
the
West
then
let
all
put
doubt
aside
that
this
thing
indeed
what
the
Wise
have
declared
the
treasure
the
Enemy
fraught
with
all
his
malice
and
lies
great
part
his
strength
old
Out
the
Black
Years
come
the
words
that
the
Smiths
Eregion
heard
and
knew
that
they
had
been
betrayed
One
Ring
rule
them
all
One
Ring
find
them
One
Ring
bring
them
all
and
the
Darkness
bind
them
Know
also
friends
that
learned
more
yet
from
Gollum
was
loth
speak
and
his
tale
was
unclear
but
beyond
all
doubt
that
went
Mordor
and
there
all
that
knew
was
forced
from
him
Thus
the
Enemy
knows
now
that
the
One
found
that
was
long
the
Shire
and
since
his
servants
have
pursued
almost
our
door
soon
will
know
already
may
know
even
speak
that
have
here
THE
COUNCIL
ELROND
255
All
sat
silent
for
while
until
length
Boromir
spoke
small
thing
you
say
this
Gollum
Small
but
great
mischief
What
became
him
what
doom
did
you
put
him
prison
but
worse
said
Aragorn
had
suffered
much
There
doubt
that
was
tormented
and
the
fear
Sauron
lies
black
his
heart
Still
for
one
glad
that
safely
kept
the
watchful
Elves
Mirkwood
His
malice
great
and
gives
him
strength
hardly
believed
one
lean
and
withered
could
work
much
mischief
still
were
free
And
not
doubt
that
was
allowed
leave
Mordor
some
evil
errand
Alas
alas
cried
Legolas
and
his
fair
Elvish
face
there
was
great
distress
The
tidings
that
was
sent
bring
must
now
told
They
are
not
good
but
only
here
have
learned
how
evil
they
may
seem
this
company
Sméagol
who
now
called
Gollum
has
escaped
Escaped
cried
Aragorn
That
ill
news
indeed
shall
all
rue
bitterly
fear
How
came
the
folk
Thranduil
fail
their
trust
Not
through
lack
watchfulness
said
Legolas
but
perhaps
through
over
kindliness
And
fear
that
the
prisoner
had
aid
from
others
and
that
more
known
our
doings
than
could
wish
guarded
this
creature
day
and
night
Gandalf
bidding
much
though
wearied
the
task
But
Gandalf
bade
hope
still
for
his
cure
and
had
not
the
heart
keep
him
ever
dungeons
under
the
earth
where
would
fall
back
into
his
old
black
thoughts
You
were
less
tender
said
Gldin
with
flash
his
eyes
old
memories
were
stirred
his
imprisonment
the
deep
places
the
Elven
king
halls
Now
come
said
Gandalf
Pray
not
interrupt
good
Gloin
That
was
regrettable
misunderstanding
long
set
right
all
the
grievances
that
stand
between
Elves
and
Dwarves
are
brought
here
may
well
abandon
this
Council
Gloin
rose
and
bowed
and
Legolas
continued
the
days
fair
weather
led
Gollum
through
the
woods
and
there
was
high
tree
standing
alone
far
from
the
others
which
liked
climb
Often
let
him
mount
the
highest
branches
until
felt
the
free
wind
but
set
guard
the
tree
foot
One
day
refused
come
down
and
the
guards
had
mind
climb
after
him
had
learned
the
trick
clinging
boughs
with
his
feet
well
with
his
hands
they
sat
the
tree
far
into
the
night
was
that
very
night
summer
yet
moonless
and
starless
that
Orcs
came
unawares

off

the
woods
When
the
battle
was
over
found
that
Gollum
was
gone
and
his
guards
were
slain
taken
then
seemed
plain
that
the
attack
had
been
made
for
his
rescue
and
that
knew
beforehand
How
that
was
contrived
cannot
guess
but
Gollum
cunning
and
the
spies
the
Enemy
are
many
The
dark
things
that
were
driven
out
the
year
the
Dragon
fall
have
returned
greater
numbers
and
Mirkwood
again
evil
place
save
where
our
realm
maintained
have
failed
recapture
Gollum
came
his
trail
among
those
many
Orcs
and
plunged
deep
into
the
Forest
going
south
But
ere
long
escaped
our
skill
and
dared
not
continue
the
hunt
for
were
drawing
nigh
Dol
Guldur
and
that
still
very
evil
place
not
that
way
Well
well
gone
said
Gandalf
have
time
seek
for
him
again
must
what
will
But
may
play
part
yet
that
neither
nor
Sauron
have
foreseen
And
now
will
answer
Galdor
other
questions
What
Saruman
What
are
his
counsels
this
need
This
tale
must
tell
full
for
only
Elrond
has
heard
yet
and
that
brief
but
will
bear
all
that
must
resolve
the
last
chapter
the
Tale
the
Ring
far
has
yet
gone
the
end
June
was
the
Shire
but
cloud
anxiety
was
mind
and
rode
the
southern
borders
the
little
land
for
had
foreboding
some
danger
still
hidden
from
but
drawing
near
There
messages
reached
telling
war
and
defeat
Gondor
and
when
heard
the
Black
Shadow
chill
smote
heart
But
found
nothing
save
few
fugitives
from
the
South
yet
seemed
that
them
sat
fear
which
they
would
not
speak
turned
then
east
and
north
and
journeyed
along
the
Greenway
and
not
far
from
Bree
came
upon
traveller
sitting
bank
beside
the
road
with
his
grazing
horse
beside
him
was
Radagast
the
Brown
who
one
time
dwelt
Rhosgobel
near
the
borders
Mirkwood
one
order
but
had
not
seen
him
for
many
year
Gandalf
cried
was
seeking
you
But
stranger
these
parts
All
knew
was
that
you
might
found
wild
region
with
the
uncouth
name
Shire
Your
information
was
correct
said
But
not
put
that
way
you
meet
any
the
inhabitants
You
are
near
the
borders
the
Shire
now
And
what
you
want
with
must
pressing
You
were
never
traveller
unless
driven
great
need
have
urgent
errand
said
news
evil
Then
looked
about
him
the
hedges

have

Nazgtl
THE
COUNCIL
ELROND
257
whispered
The
Nine
are
abroad
again
They
have
crossed
the
River
secretly
and
are
moving
westward
They
have
taken
the
guise
riders
black
knew
then
what
had
dreaded
without
knowing
The
Enemy
must
have
some
great
need
purpose
said
Rada
gast
but
what
that
makes
him
look
these
distant
and
desolate
parts
cannot
guess
What
you
mean
said
have
been
told
that
wherever
they
the
Riders
ask
for
news
land
called
Shire
The
Shire
said
but
heart
sank
For
even
the
Wise
might
fear
withstand
the
Nine
when
they
are
gathered
together
under
their
fell
chieftain
great
king
and
sorcerer
was
old
and
now
wields
deadly
fear
Who
told
you
and
who
sent
you
asked
Saruman
the
White
answered
Radagast
And
told
say
that
you
feel
the
need
will
help
but
you
must
seek
his
aid
once
will
too
late
And
that
message
brought
hope
For
Saruman
the
White
the
greatest
order
Radagast
course
worthy
Wizard
master
shapes
and
changes
hue
and
has
much
lore
herbs
and
beasts
and
birds
are
especially
his
friends
But
Saruman
has
long
studied
the
arts
the
Enemy
himself
and
thus
have
often
been
able
forestall
him
was
the
devices
Saruman
that
drove
him
from
Dol
Guldur
might
that
had
found
some
weapons
that
would
drive
back
the
Nine
will
Saruman
said
Then
you
must
now
said
Radagast
for
have
wasted
time
looking
for
you
and
the
days
are
running
short
was
told
find
you
before
Midsummer
and
that
now
here
Even
you
set
out
from
this
spot
you
will
hardly
reach
him
before
the
Nine
discover
the
land
that
they
seek
myself
shall
turn
back
once
And
with
that
mounted
and
would
have
ridden
straight
off
Stay
moment
said
shall
need
your
help
and
the
help
all
things
that
will
give
Send
out
messages
all
the
beasts
and
birds
that
are
your
friends
Tell
them
bring
news
anything
that
bears
this
matter
Saruman
and
Gandalf
Let
messages
sent
Orthanc
will
that
said
and
rode
off
the
Nine
were
after
him
could
not
follow
him
then
and
there
had
ridden
very
far
already
that
day
and
was
weary
horse
and
needed
consider
matters
stayed
the
night
Bree
and
decided
that
had
time
return
the
Shire
Never
did
make
greater
mistake

THE
LORD

However
wrote
message
Frodo
and
trusted
friend

him
rode
away
dawn
and
came
long
last
the
dwelling
Saruman
That
far
south
Isengard
the
end
the
Misty
Mountains
not
far
from
the
Gap
Rohan
And
Boromir
will
tell
you
that
that
great
open
vale
that
lies
between
the
Misty
Mountains
and
the
northmost
foothills
Ered
Nimrais

Mountains

But
Isengard

sheer

that

with

and
the
midst
that

tower

called
Orthanc
was
not

but
the

Numenor
long
ago
and
very
tall
and
has
many
secrets
yet
looks
not
work
craft
cannot
reached
save
passing
the
circle
Isengard
and
that
circle
there
only
one
gate
Late
one
evening
came
the
gate
like
great
arch
the
wall
rock
and
was
strongly
guarded
But
the
keepers
the
gate
were
the
watch
for
and
told
that
Saruman
awaited
rode
under
the
arch
and
the
gate
closed
silently
behind
and
suddenly
was
afraid
though
knew
reason
for
But
rode
the
foot
Orthanc
and
came
the
stair
Saruman
and
there
met
and
led
his
high
chamber
wore
ring
his
finger
you
have
come
Gandalf
said
gravely
but
his
eyes
there
seemed
white
light
cold
laughter
was
his
heart
Yes
have
come
said
have
come
for
your
aid
Saruman
the
White
And
that
title
seemed
anger
him
Have
you
indeed
Gandalf
the
Grey
scoffed
For
aid
has
seldom
been
heard
that
Gandalf
the
Grey
sought
for
aid
one
cunning
and
wise
wandering
about
the
lands
and
concerning
himself
every
business
whether
belongs
him
not
looked
him
and
wondered
But
not
deceived
said
things
are
now
moving
which
will
require
the
union
all
our
strength
That
may
said
but
the
thought
late
coming
you
How
long
wonder
have
you
concealed
from
the
head
the
Council
matter
greatest
import
What
brings
you
now
from
your
lurking
place
the
Shire
The
Nine
have
come
forth
again
answered
They
have
crossed
the
River
Radagast
said
Radagast
the
Brown
laughed
Saruman
and
longer
con
cealed
his
scorn
Radagast
the
Bird
tamer
Radagast
the
Simple
Radagast
the
Fool
Yet
had
just
the
wit
play
the
part
that
set
him
For
you
have
come
and
that
was
all
the
purpose

And
here
you
will
stay
Gandalf

and
rest
from

that

had
seemed
white
were
not

were
woven

the
ignorant
cannot
think
that
you

only

sidelong
and

Well

that

And

260
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Gandalf
whispered
Why
not
The
Ruling
Ring
could
command
that
then
the
Power
would
pass
That
truth
why
brought
you
here
For
have
many
eyes
service
and
believe
that
you
know
where
this
precious
thing
now
lies
not
why
the
Nine
ask
for
the
Shire
and
what
your
business
there
said
this
lust
which
could
not
conceal
shone
suddenly
his
eyes
Saruman
said
standing
away
from
him
only
one
hand
time
can
wield
the
One
and
you
know
that
well
not
trouble
say
But
would
not
give
nay
would
not
give
even
news
you
now
that
learn
your
mind
You
were
head
the
Council
but
you
have
unmasked
yourself
last
Well
the
choices
are
seems
submit
Sauron
yourself
will
take
neither
Have
you
others
offer
was
cold
now
and
perilous
Yes
said
did
not
expect
you
show
wisdom
even
your
own
behalf
but
gave
you
the
chance
aiding
willingly
and
saving
yourself
much
trouble
and
pain
The
third
choice
stay
here
until
the
end
Until
what
end
Until
you
reveal
where
the
One
may
found
may
find
means
persuade
you
until
found
your
despite
and
the
Ruler
has
time
turn
lighter
matters
devise
say
fitting
reward
for
the
hindrance
and
insolence
Gandalf
the
Grey
That
may
not
prove
one
the
lighter
matters
said
laughed
for
words
were
empty
and
knew
They
took
and
they
set
alone
the
pinnacle
Orthanc
the
place
where
Saruman
was
accustomed
watch
the
stars
There
descent
save
narrow
stair
many
thousand
steps
and
the
valley
below
seems
far
away
looked
and
saw
that
whereas
had
once
been
green
and
fair
was
now
filled
with
pits
and
forges
Wolves
and
orcs
were
housed
Isengard
for
Saruman
was
mustering
great
force
his
own
account
rivalry
Sauron
and
not
his
service
yet
Over
all
his
works
dark
smoke
hung
and
wrapped
itself
about
the
sides
Orthanc
stood
alone
island
the
clouds
and
had
chance
escape
and
days
were
bitter
was
pierced
with
cold
and
had
but
little
room
which
pace
and
fro
brooding
the
coming
the
Riders
the
North
That
the
Nine
had
indeed
arisen
felt
assured
apart
from
the
words
Saruman
which
might
lies
Long
ere
came
Isengard
had
heard
tidings
the
way
that
could
not
mistaken
Fear
was
ever
heart
for
friends
the
Shire
but
still
had
some
hope
hoped
that
Frodo
had
set
forth
once
letter
had
urged
and
that
had
reached
Rivendell
before
the
deadly
pursuit
THE
COUNCIL
ELROND
261
began
And
both
fear
and
hope
proved
ill
founded
For
hope
was
founded
fat
man
Bree
and
fear
was
founded
the
cunning
Sauron
But
fat
men
who
sell
ale
have
many
calls
answer
and
the
power
Sauron
still
less
than
fear
makes
But
the
circle
Isengard
trapped
and
alone
was
not
easy
think
that
the
hunters
before
whom
all
have
fled
fallen
would
falter
the
Shire
far
away
saw
you
cried
Frodo
You
were
walking
backwards
and
for
wards
The
moon
shone
your
hair
Gandalf
paused
astonished
and
looked
him
was
only
dream
said
Frodo
but
suddenly
came
back
had
quite
forgotten
came
some
time
ago
after
left
the
Shire
think
Then
was
late
coming
said
Gandalf
you
will
see
was
evil
plight
And
those
who
know
will
agree
that
have
seldom
been
such
need
and
not
bear
such
misfortune
well
Gandalf
the
Grey
caught
like
fly
spider
treacherous
web
Yet
even
the
most
subtle
spiders
may
leave
weak
thread
first
feared
Saruman
doubt
intended
that
Radagast
had
also
fallen
Yet
had
caught
hint
anything
wrong
his
voice
his
eye
our
meeting
had
should
never
have
gone
Isengard
should
have
gone
more
warily
Saruman
guessed
and
had
concealed
his
mind
and
deceived
his
messenger
would
have
been
useless
any
case
try
and
win
over
the
honest
Radagast
treachery
sought
good
faith
and
persuaded
That
was
the
undoing
Saruman
plot
For
Radagast
knew
reason
why
should
not
asked
and
rode
away
towards
Mirkwood
where
had
many
friends
old
And
the
Eagles
the
Mountains
went
far
and
wide
and
they
saw
many
things
the
gather
ing
wolves
and
the
mustering
Orcs
and
the
Nine
Riders
going
hither
and
thither
the
lands
and
they
heard
news
the
escape
Gollum
And
they
sent
messenger
bring
these
tidings
was
that
when
summer
waned
there
came
night
moon
and
Gwaihir
the
Windlord
swiftest
the
Great
Eagles
came
unlooked
for
Orthanc
and
found
standing
the
pinnacle
Then
spoke
him
and
bore
away
before
Saruman
was
aware
was
far
from
Isengard
ere
the
wolves
and
orcs
issued
from
the
gate
pursue
How
far
can
you
bear
said
Gwaihir
Many
leagues
said
but
not
the
ends
the
earth
was
sent
bear
tidings
not
burdens
Then
must
have
steed
land
said
cand
steed
surpass
ingly
swift
for
have
never
had
such
need
haste
before
Then
will
bear
you

Lord

And

said
Gwaihir
for

faith
They

answered
cand

many
yearly
Mordor
said
but
they

But
Saruman

become
evil
you
say
then
their
doom
cannot
long
delayed
set
down
the
land
Rohan
ere
dawn
and
now
have
lengthened
tale
over
long
The
rest

brief
Rohan

work
the

Saruman
and
the

not

and
chose
one

little
his
took
the
best
horse

never

Then

Aragorn

grieves
more
than
many

seem
worse
learn
that
Sauron

Nor

Not

Boromir
that

They

And
not
without

for

from

from

Never

THE

remained
the

not
far
from
the
Greenway
and
some
invaded
the
Shire
from
the
south
came
Hobbiton
and
Frodo
had
gone
but
had
words
with
old
Gamgee
Many
words
and
few
the
point
had
much
say
about
the
shortcomings

new
owners

Changes
for

repeated
many
times
Worst
bad
word
said
him
and
hope
you
not
live

But
amidst
his
talk
gathered
last
that
Frodo
had
left
Hobbiton
less
than
week
before
and
that
black
horseman
had
come
the
Hill
the
same
evening
Then
rode
fear
came
Buckland
and
found
uproar
busy
hive
ants
that
has
been
stirred
with
stick
came
the
house
Crickhollow
and
was
broken
open
and
empty
but
the
threshold
there
lay
cloak
that
had
been
Frodo
Then
for
while
hope
left
and
did
not
wait
gather
news
might
have
been
comforted
but
rode
the
trail
the
Riders
was
hard
follow
for
went
many
ways
and
was
loss
But
seemed
that
one
two
had
ridden
towards
Bree
and
that
way
went
for
thought
words
that
might
said
the
innkeeper
Butterbur
they
call
him
thought
this
delay
was
his
fault
will
melt
all
the
butter
him
will
roast
the
old
fool
over
slow
fire
expected
less
and
when
saw
face
fell
down
flat
and
began
melt
the
spot
What
did
you
him
cried
Frodo
alarm
was
really
very
kind
and
did
all
that
could
Gandalf
laughed
Don
afraid
said
did
not
bite
and
barked
very
little
overjoyed
was
the
news
that
got
out
him
when
stopped
quaking
that
embraced
the
old
fellow
How
had
happened
could
not
then
guess
but
learned
that
you
had
been
Bree
the
night
before
and
had
gone
off
that
morning
with
Strider
Strider
cried
shouting
for
joy
Yes
sir
afraid
sir
said
Butterbur
mistaking
got
them
spite
all
that
could
and
they
took
with
him
They
behaved
very
queer
all
the
time
they
were
here

might
say
Ass

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
stayed
there
that
night
wondering
much
what
had
become
the
Riders
for
only
two
had
there
yet
been
any
news
Bree
seemed
But
the
night
heard
more
Five
least
came
from
the
west
and
they
threw
down
the
gates
and
passed
through
Bree
like
howling
wind
and
the
Bree
folk
are
still
shivering
and
pecting
the
end
the
world
got
before
dawn
and
went
after
them
not
know
but
seems
clear
that
this
what
happened
Their
Captain
remained
secret
away
south
Bree
while
two
rode
ahead
through
the
village
and
four
more
invaded
the
Shire
But
when
these
were
foiled
Bree
and
Crickhollow
they
returned
their
Captain
with
tidings
and
left
the
Road
unguarded
for
while
except
their
spies
The
Captain
then
sent
some
eastward
straight
across
country
and
himself
with
the
rest
rode
along
the
Road
great
wrath
galloped
Weathertop
like
gale
and
reached
before
sundown
second
day
from
Bree
and
they
were
there
before
They
drew
away
from
for
they
felt
the
coming
anger
and
they
dared
not
face
while
the
Sun
was
the
sky
But
they
closed
round
night
and
was
besieged
the
hill
top
the
old
ring
Amon
Stl
was
hard
put
indeed
such
light
and
flame
cannot
have
been
seen
Weathertop
since
the
war
beacons
old
sunrise
escaped
and
fled
towards
the
north
could
not
hope
more
was
impossible
find
you
Frodo
the
wilderness
and
would
have
been
folly
try
with
all
the
Nine
heels
had
trust
Aragorn
But
hoped
draw
some
them
off
and
yet
reach
Rivendell
ahead
you
and
send
out
help
Four
Riders
did
indeed
follow
but
they
turned
back
after
while
and
made
for
the
Ford
seems
That
helped
little
for
there
were
only
five
not
nine
when
your
camp
was
attacked
reached
here
last
long
hard
road
the
Hoarwell
and
through
the
Ettenmoors
and
down
from
the
north
took
nearly
fifteen
days
from
Weathertop
for
could
not
ride
among
the
rocks
the
troll
fells
and
Shadowfax
departed
sent
him
back
his
master
but
great
friendship
has
grown
between
and
have
need
will
come
call
But
was
that
came
Rivendell
only
two
days
before
the
Ring
and
news
its
peril
had
already
been
brought
here
which
proved
well
indeed
And
that
Frodo
the
end
account
May
Elrond
and
the
others
forgive
the
length
But
such
thing
has
not
happened
before
that
Gandalf
broke
tryst
and
did
not
come
when
promised
account
the
Ring
bearer
strange
event
was
required
think
Well
the
Tale
now
told
from
first
last
Here
all
are
and
THE
COUNCIL
ELROND
265
here
the
Ring
But
have
not
yet
come
any
nearer
our
purpose
What
shall
with
There
was
silence
last
Elrond
spoke
again
This
grievous
news
concerning
Saruman
said
for
trusted
him
and
deep
all
our
counsels
perilous
study
too
deeply
the
arts
the
Enemy
for
good
for
ill
But
such
falls
and
betrayals
alas
have
happened
before
the
tales
that
have
heard
this
day
the
tale
Frodo
was
most
strange
have
known
few
hobbits
save
Bilbo
here
and
seems
that
perhaps
not
alone
and
singular
had
thought
him
The
world
has
changed
much
since
last
was
the
westward
roads
The
Barrow
wights
know
many
names
and
the
Old
Forest
many
tales
have
been
told
all
that
now
remains
but
outlier
its
northern
march
Time
was
when
squirrel
could
from
tree
tree
from
what
now
the
Shire
Dunland
west
Isengard
those
lands
journeyed
once
and
many
things
wild
and
strange
knew
But
had
forgotten
Bombadil
indeed
this
still
the
same
that
walked
the
woods
and
hills
long
ago
and
even
then
was
older
than
the
old
That
was
not
then
his
name
Iarwain
Ben
adar
called
him
oldest
and
fatherless
But
many
another
name
has
since
been
given
other
folk
Forn
the
Dwarves
Orald
Northern
Men
and
other
names
beside
strange
creature
but
maybe
should
have
summoned
him
our
Council
would
not
have
come
said
Gandalf
Could
not
still
send
messages
him
and
obtain
his
help
asked
Erestor
seems
that
has
power
even
over
the
Ring
should
not
put
said
Gandalf
Say
rather
that
the
Ring
has
power
over
him
his
own
master
But
cannot
alter
the
Ring
itself
nor
break
its
power
over
others
And
now
withdrawn
into
little
land
within
bounds
that
has
set
though
none
can
see
them
waiting
perhaps
for
change
days
and
will
not
step
beyond
them
But
within
those
bounds
nothing
seems
dismay
him
said
Erestor
Would
not
take
the
Ring
and
keep
there
for
ever
harmless
said
Gandalf
not
willingly
might
all
the
free
folk
the
world
begged
him
but
would
not
understand
the
need
And
were
given
the
Ring
would
soon
forget
most
likely
throw
away
Such
things
have
hold
his
mind
would
most
unsafe
guardian
and
that
alone
answer
enough
But
any
case
said
Glorfindel
send
the
Ring
him
would
only
postpone
the
day
evil
far
away
could
not
now
take
back
him
unguessed
unmarked
any
spy
And
even
266
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
could
soon
late
the
Lord
the
Rings
would
learn
its
hiding
place
and
would
bend
all
his
power
towards
Could
that
power
defied
Bombadil
alone
think
not
think
that
the
end
all
else
conquered
Bombadil
will
fall
Last
was
First
and
then
Night
will
come
know
little
Iarwain
save
the
name
said
Galdor
but
Glorfin
del
think
right
Power
defy
our
Enemy
not
him
unless
such
power
the
earth
itself
And
yet
see
that
Sauron
can
torture
and
destroy
the
very
hills
What
power
still
remains
lies
with
here
Imladris
with
Cirdan
the
Havens
Lorien
But
have
they
the
strength
have
here
the
strength
withstand
the
Enemy
the
coming
Sauron
the
last
when
all
else
overthrown
have
not
the
strength
said
Elrond
neither
have
they
Then
the
Ring
cannot
kept
from
him
for
ever
strength
said
Glorfindel
two
things
only
remain
for
attempt
send
over
the
Sea
destroy
But
Gandalf
has
revealed
that
cannot
destroy
any
craft
that
here
possess
said
Elrond
And
they
who
dwell
beyond
the
Sea
would
not
receive
for
good
ill
belongs
Middle
earth
for
who
still
dwell
here
deal
with
Then
said
Glorfindel
let
cast
into
the
deeps
and
make
the
lies
Saruman
come
true
For
clear
now
that
even
the
Council
his
feet
were
already
crooked
path
knew
that
the
Ring
was
not
lost
for
ever
but
wished
think
for
began
lust
for
for
himself
Yet
oft
lies
truth
hidden
the
Sea
would
safe
Not
safe
for
ever
said
Gandalf
There
are
many
things
the
deep
waters
and
seas
and
lands
may
change
And
not
our
part
here
take
thought
only
for
season
for
few
lives
Men
for
passing
age
the
world
should
seek
final
end
this
menace
even
not
hope
make
one
And
that
shall
not
find
the
roads
the
Sea
said
Galdor
the
return
Iarwain
thought
too
dangerous
then
flight
the
Sea
now
fraught
with
gravest
peril
heart
tells
that
Sauron
will
expect
take
the
western
way
when
learns
what
has
befallen
soon
will
The
Nine
have
been
unhorsed
indeed
but
that
but
respite
ere
they
find
new
steeds
and
swifter
Only
the
waning
might
Gondor
stands
now
between
him
and
march
power
along
the
coasts
into
the
North
and
comes
assailing
the
White
Towers
and
the
Havens
hereafter
the
Elves
may
have
escape
from
the
lengthening
shadows
Middle
earth
Long
yet
will
that
march
delayed
said
Boromir
Gondor
wanes
you
say
But
Gondor
stands
and
even
the
end
its
strength
still
very
strong
THE
COUNCIL
ELROND
267
And
yet
its
vigilance
can
longer
keep
back
the
Nine
said
Galdor
And
other
roads
may
find
that
Gondor
does
not
guard
Then
said
Erestor
there
are
but
two
courses
Glorfindel
already
has
declared
hide
the
Ring
for
ever
unmake
But
both
are
beyond
our
power
Who
will
read
this
riddle
for
None
here
can
said
Elrond
gravely
least
none
can
foretell
what
will
come
pass
take
this
road
that
But
seems
now
clear
which
the
road
that
must
take
The
westward
road
seems
easiest
Therefore
must
shunned
will
watched
Too
often
the
Elves
have
fled
that
way
Now
this
last
must
take
hard
road
road
unforeseen
There
lies
our
hope
hope
walk
into
peril
Mordor
must
send
the
Ring
the
Fire
Silence
fell
again
Frodo
even
that
fair
house
looking
out
upon
sunlit
valley
filled
with
the
noise
clear
waters
felt
dead
darkness
his
heart
Boromir
stirred
and
Frodo
looked
him
was
fingering
his
great
horn
and
frowning
length
spoke
not
understand
all
this
said
Saruman
traitor
but
did
not
have
glimpse
wisdom
Why
you
speak
ever
hiding
and
destroying
Why
should
not
think
that
the
Great
Ring
has
come
into
our
hands
serve
the
very
hour
need
Wielding
the
Free
Lords
the
Free
may
surely
defeat
the
Enemy
That
what
most
fears
deem
The
Men
Gondor
are
valiant
and
they
will
never
submit
but
they
may
beaten
down
Valour
needs
first
strength
and
then
weapon
Let
the
Ring
your
weapon
has
such
power
you
say
Take
and
forth
victory
Alas
said
Elrond
cannot
use
the
Ruling
Ring
That
now
know
too
well
belongs
Sauron
and
was
made
him
alone
and
altogether
evil
Its
strength
Boromir
too
great
for
anyone
wield
will
save
only
those
who
have
already
great
power
their
own
But
for
them
holds
even
deadlier
peril
The
very
desire
corrupts
the
heart
Consider
Saruman
any
the
Wise
should
with
this
Ring
overthrow
the
Lord
Mordor
using
his
own
arts
would
then
set
himself
Sauron
throne
and
yet
another
Dark
Lord
would
appear
And
that
another
reason
why
the
Ring
should
destroyed
long
the
world
will
danger
even
the
Wise
For
nothing
evil
the
beginning
Even
Sauron
was
not
fear
take
the
Ring
hide
will
not
take
the
Ring
wield
Nor
said
Gandalf
Boromir
looked
them
doubtfully
but
bowed
his
head
said
Then
Gondor
must
trust
such
weapons
268
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
have
And
the
least
while
the
Wise
ones
guard
this
Ring
will
fight
Mayhap
the
Sword
that
was
Broken
may
still
stem
the
tide
the
hand
that
wields
has
inherited
not
heirloom
only
but
the
sinews
the
Kings
Men
Who
can
tell
said
Aragorn
But
will
put
the
test
one
day
May
the
day
not
too
long
delayed
said
Boromir
For
though
not
ask
for
aid
need
would
comfort
know
that
others
fought
also
with
all
the
means
that
they
have
Then
comforted
said
Elrond
For
there
are
other
powers
and
realms
that
you
know
not
and
they
are
hidden
from
you
Anduin
the
Great
flows
past
many
shores
ere
comes
Argonath
and
the
Gates
Gondor
Still
might
well
for
all
said
Gloin
the
Dwarf
all
these
strengths
were
joined
and
the
powers
each
were
used
league
Other
rings
there
may
less
treacherous
that
might
used
our
need
The
Seven
are
lost
Balin
has
not
found
the
ring
Thror
which
was
the
last
naught
has
been
heard
since
Thror
perished
Moria
Indeed
may
now
reveal
that
was
partly
hope
find
that
ring
that
Balin
went
away
Balin
will
find
ring
Moria
said
Gandalf
Thror
gave
Thrain
his
son
but
not
Thrain
Thorin
was
taken
with
torment
from
Thrain
the
dungeons
Dol
Guldur
came
too
late
alas
cried
Gloin
When
will
the
day
come
our
revenge
But
still
there
are
the
Three
What
the
Three
Rings
the
Elves
Very
mighty
Rings
said
not
the
Elf
lords
keep
them
Yet
they
too
were
made
the
Dark
Lord
long
ago
Are
they
idle
see
Elf
lords
here
Will
they
not
say
The
Elves
returned
answer
Did
you
not
hear
Gloin
said
Elrond
The
Three
were
not
made
Sauron
nor
did
ever
touch
them
But
them
not
permitted
speak
much
only
this
hour
doubt
may
now
say
They
are
not
idle
But
they
were
not
made
weapons
war
conquest
that
not
their
power
Those
who
made
them
did
not
desire
strength
domination
hoarded
wealth
but
understanding
making
and
healing
preserve
all
things
unstained
These
things
the
Elves
Middle
earth
have
some
measure
gained
though
with
sorrow
But
all
that
has
been
wrought
those
who
wield
the
Three
will
turn
their
undoing
and
their
minds
and
hearts
will
become
revealed
Sauron
regains
the
One
would
better
the
Three
had
never
been
That
his
purpose
But
what
then
would
happen
the
Ruling
Ring
were
destroyed
you
counsel
asked
Gloin
know
not
for
certain
answered
Elrond
sadly
Some
hope
THE
COUNCIL
ELROND
269
that
the
Three
Rings
which
Sauron
has
never
touched
would
then
become
free
and
their
rulers
might
heal
the
hurts
the
world
that
has
wrought
But
maybe
when
the
One
has
gone
the
Three
will
fail
and
many
fair
things
will
fade
and
forgotten
That
belief
Yet
all
the
Elves
are
willing
endure
this
chance
said
Glorfindel
the
power
Sauron
may
broken
and
the
fear
his
dominion
taken
away
for
ever
Thus
return
once
more
the
destroying
the
Ring
said
Erestor
and
yet
come
nearer
What
strength
have
for
the
finding
the
Fire
which
was
made
That
the
path
despair
folly
would
say
the
long
wisdom
Elrond
did
not
forbid
Despair
folly
said
Gandalf
not
despair
for
despair
only
for
those
who
see
the
end
beyond
all
doubt
not
wisdom
recognize
necessity
when
all
other
courses
have
been
weighed
though
folly
may
appear
those
who
cling
false
hope
Well
let
folly
our
cloak
veil
before
the
eyes
the
Enemy
For
very
wise
and
weighs
all
things
nicety
the
scales
his
malice
But
the
only
measure
that
knows
desire
desire
for
power
and
judges
all
hearts
Into
his
heart
the
thought
will
not
enter
that
any
will
refuse
that
having
the
Ring
may
seek
destroy
seek
this
shall
put
him
out
reckoning
least
for
while
said
Elrond
The
road
must
trod
but
will
very
hard
And
neither
strength
nor
wisdom
will
carry
far
upon
This
quest
may
attempted
the
weak
with
much
hope
the
strong
Yet
such
oft
the
course
deeds
that
move
the
wheels
the
world
small
hands
them
because
they
must
while
the
eyes
the
great
are

Very
well
very
well
Master
Elrond
said
Bilbo
suddenly
Say
more
plain
enough
what
you
are
pointing
Bilbo
the
silly
hobbit
started
this
affair
and
Bilbo
had
better
finish
himself
was
very
comfortable
here
and
getting
with
book
you
want
know
just
writing
ending
for
had
thought
putting
and
lived
happily
ever
afterwards
the
end
his
days
good
ending
and
none
the
worse
for
having
been
used
before
Now
shall
have
alter
that
does
not
look
like
coming
true
and
anyway
there
will
evidently
have
several
more
chapters
live
write
them
frightful
nuisance
When
ought
start
Boromir
looked
surprise
Bilbo
but
the
laughter
died
his
lips
when
saw
that
all
the
others
regarded
the
old
hobbit
with
grave
respect
Only
Gloin
smiled
but
his
smile
came
from
old
memories
course
dear
Bilbo
said
Gandalf
you
had
really
started
270
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
this
affair
you
might
expected
finish
But
you
know
well
enough
now
that
starting
too
great
claim
for
any
and
that
only
small
part
played
great
deeds
any
hero
You
need
not
bow
Though
the
word
was
meant
and
not
doubt
that
under
jest
you
are
making
valiant
offer
But
one
beyond
your
strength
Bilbo
You
cannot
take
this
thing
back
has
passed
you
need
advice
any
longer
should
say
that
your
part
ended
unless
recorder
Finish
your
book
and
leave
the
ending
unaltered
There
still
hope
for
But
get
ready
write
sequel
when
they
come
back
Bilbo
laughed
have
never
known
you
give
pleasant
advice
before
said
all
your
unpleasant
advice
has
been
good

this
advice
not

Still
don

not
But
tell
what
you

The

who

with

Exactly
And
who
are
they
That
seems
what
this

All
the

sat
with

that

But
you
won

off

surely
Master
cried
Sam
unable
contain
himself
any
longer
and
jumping
from
the
corner
where
had
been
quietly
sitting
the
floor
indeed
said
Elrond
turning
towards
him
with
smile
You
least
shall
with
him
hardly
possible
separate
you
from
him
even
when
summoned
secret

and

Sam
sat
down

and
muttering

Frodo
said
shaking

head
Chapter
THE
RING
GOES
SOUTH
Later
that
day
the
hobbits
held
meeting
their
own
Bilbo
room
Merry
and
Pippin
were
indignant
when
they
heard
that
Sam
had
crept
into
the
Council
and
had
been
chosen
Frodo
com
panion
most
unfair
said
Pippin
Instead
throwing
him
out
and
clapping
him
chains
Elrond
goes
and
rewards
him
for
his
cheek
Rewards
said
Frodo
can
imagine
more
severe
punishment
You
are
not
thinking
what
you
are
saying
condemned
this
hopeless
journey
reward
Yesterday
dreamed
that
task
was
done
and
could
rest
here
long
while
perhaps
for
good
don
wonder
said
Merry
and
wish
you
could
But
are
envying
Sam
not
you
you
have
then
will
punishment
for
any
left
behind
even
Rivendell
have
come
long
way
with
you
and
been
through
some
stiff
times
want
That
what
meant
said
Pippin
hobbits
ought
stick
together
and
will
shall
unless
they
chain
There
must
someone
with
intelligence
the
party
Then
you
certainly
will
not
chosen
Peregrin
Took
said
Gandalf
looking
through
the
window
which
was
near
the
ground
But
you
are
all
worrying
yourselves
unnecessarily
Nothing
decided
yet
Nothing
decided
cried
Pippin
Then
what
were
you
all
doing
You
were
shut
for
hours
Talking
said
Bilbo
There
was
deal
talk
and
everyone
had
eye
opener
Even
old
Gandalf
think
Legolas
bit
news
about
Gollum
caught
even
him
the
hop
though
passed
off
You
were
wrong
said
Gandalf
You
were
inattentive
had
already
heard
from
Gwaihir
you
want
know
the
only
real
eye
openers
you
put
were
you
and
Frodo
and
was
the
only
one
that
was
not
surprised
Well
anyway
said
Bilbo
nothing
was
decided
beyond
choosing
poor
Frodo
and
Sam
was
afraid
all
the
time
that
might
come
that
was
let
off
But
you
ask
Elrond
will
send
out
fair
number
when
the
reports
come
Have
they
started
yet
Gandalf
Yes
said
the
wizard
Some
the
scouts
have
been
sent
out
already
More
will
tomorrow
Elrond
sending
Elves
and
they
will
get
touch
with
the
Rangers
and
maybe
with
Thranduil
folk
THE

And
Aragorn

gone
with
Elrond
sons
shall
have
scour
the
lands
all
round
for
many
long
leagues
before
any
move
made
cheer
Frodo
You
will
probably
make
quite
long
stay
here
said
Sam
gloomily
just
wait
long
enough
for
winter
come
That
can
helped
said
Bilbo
your
fault
partly
Frodo
lad
insisting
waiting
for
birthday
funny
way
honouring
can
help
thinking
Not
the
day
should
have
chosen
for
letting
the
into
Bag
End
But
there
you
can
wait
now
till
spring
and
you
can
till
the
reports
come
back
When
winter
first
begins
bite
and
stones
crack
the
frosty
night
when
pools
are
black
and
trees
are
bare
ris
evil
the
Wild
fare
But
that
afraid
will
just
your
luck
afraid
will
said
Gandalf
can
start
until
have
found
out
about
the
Riders
thought
they
were
all
destroyed
the
flood
said
Merry
You
cannot
destroy
Ringwraiths
like
that
said
Gandalf
The
power
their
master
them
and
they
stand
fall
him
hope
that
they
were
all
unhorsed
and
unmasked
and
made
for
while
less
dangerous
but
must
find
out
for
certain
the
mean
time
you
should
try
and
forget
your
troubles
Frodo
not
know
can
anything
help
you
but
will
whisper
this
your
ears
Someone
said
that
intelligence
would
needed
the
party
was
right
think
shall
come
with
you
great
was
Frodo
delight
this
announcement
that
Gandalf
left
the
window
sill
where
had
been
sitting
and
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
only
said
think
shall
come
not
count
anything
yet
this
matter
Elrond
will
have
much
say
and
your
friend
the
Strider
Which
reminds
want
see
Elrond
must
off
How
long
you
think
shall
have
here
said
Frodo
Bilbo
when
Gandalf
had
gone
don
know
can
count
days
Rivendell
said
Bilbo
But
quite
long
should
think
can
have
many
good
talk
What
about
helping
with
book
and
making
start
the
next
Have
you
thought
ending
Yes
several
and
all
are
dark
and
unpleasant
said
Frodo
that
won
said
Bilbo
Books
ought
have
good
endings
How
would
this
and
they
all
settled
down
and
lived
together
happily
ever
after
274
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
will
well
ever
comes
that
said
Frodo
said
Sam
And
where
will
they
live
That
what
often
wonder
For
while
the
hobbits
continued
talk
and
think
the
past
journey
and
the
perils
that
lay
ahead
but
such
was
the
virtue
the
land
Rivendell
that
soon
all
fear
and
anxiety
was
lifted
from
their
minds
The
future
good
ill
was
not
forgotten
but
ceased
have
any
power
over
the
present
Health
and
hope
grew
strong
them
and
they
were
content
with
each
good
day
came
taking
pleasure
every
meal
and
every
word
and
song
the
days
slipped
away
each
morning
dawned
bright
and
fair
and
each
evening
followed
cool
and
clear
But
autumn
was
waning
fast
slowly
the
golden
light
faded
pale
silver
and
the
lingering
leaves
fell
from
the
naked
trees
wind
began
blow
chill
from
the
Misty
Mountains
the
east
The
Hunter
Moon
waxed
round
the
night
sky
and
put
flight
all
the
lesser
stars
But
low
the
South
one
star
shone
red
Every
night
the
Moon
waned
again
shone
brighter
and
brighter
Frodo
could
see
from
his
window
deep
the
heavens
burning
like
watchful
eye
that
glared
above
the
trees
the
brink
the
valley
The
hobbits
had
been
nearly
two
months
the
house
Elrond
and
November
had
gone
with
the
last
shreds
autumn
and
December
was
passing
when
the
scouts
began
return
Some
had
gone
north
beyond
the
springs
the
Hoarwell
into
the
Ettenmoors
and
others
had
gone
west
and
with
the
help
Aragorn
and
the
Rangers
had
searched
the
lands
far
down
the
Greyflood
far
Tharbad
where
the
old
North
Road
crossed
the
river
ruined
town
Many
had
gone
east
and
south
and
some
these
had
crossed
the
Mountains
and
entered
Mirkwood
while
others
had
climbed
the
pass
the
sources
the
Gladden
River
and
had
come
down
into
Wilderland
and
over
the
Gladden
Fields
and
length
had
reached
the
old
home
Radagast
Rhosgobel
Radagast
was
not
there
and
they
had
returned
over
the
high
pass
that
was
called
the
Redhorn
Gate
The
sons
Elrond
Elladan
and
Elrohir
were
the
last
return
they
had
made
great
journey
passing
down
the
Silverlode
into
strange
country
but
their
errand
they
would
not
speak
any
save
Elrond
region
had
the
messengers
discovered
any
signs
tidings
the
Riders
other
servants
the
Enemy
Even
from
the
Eagles
the
Misty
Mountains
they
had
learned
fresh
news
Nothing
had
been
seen
heard
Gollum
but
the
wild
wolves
were
still
gathering
and
were
hunting
again

from

North
Eight
out
the
Nine
are
accounted
for
least
said
Gandalf
rash
too
sure
yet
think
that
may
hope
now
that
the
Ringwraiths
were
scattered
and
have
been
obliged
return
best
they
could
their
Master
Mordor
empty
and
shapeless
that
will
some
time
before
they
can
begin
the
hunt
again
course
the
Enemy
has
other
servants
but
they
will
have
journey
all
the
way
the
borders
Rivendell
before
they
can
pick
our
trail
And
are
careful
that
will
hard
find
But
must
delay
longer
Elrond
summoned
the
hobbits
him
looked
gravely
Frodo
The
time
has
come
said
the
Ring
set
out
must
soon
But
those
who
with
must
not
count
their
errand
being
aided
war
force
They
must
pass
into
the
domain
the
Enemy
far
from
aid
you
still
hold
your
word
Frodo
that
you
will
the
Ring
bearer
said
Frodo
will
with
Sam
Then
cannot
help
you
much
not
even
with
counsel
said
Elrond
can
foresee
very
little
your
road
and
how
your
task
achieved
not
know
The
Shadow
has
crept
now
the
feet
the
Mountains
and
draws
nigh
even
the
borders
the
Grey
flood
and
under
the
Shadow
all
dark
You
will
meet
many
foes
some
open
and
some
disguised
and
you
may
find
friends
upon
your
way
when
you
least
look
for
will
send
out
messages
such
can
contrive
those
whom
know
the
wide
world
but
perilous
are
the
lands
now
become
that
some
may
well
miscarry
come
quicker
than
you
yourself
And
will
choose
you
companions
with
you
far
they
will
fortune
allows
The
number
must
few
since
your
hope
speed

Had

Mordor
The

With

Strider
cried
Frodo
Yes
said
with
smile
ask
leave
once
again
your
companion
Frodo
would
have
begged
you
come
said
Frodo
only
thought
you
were
going
Minas

with
Boromir
said
Aragorn
And
the
Sword
that
was
Broken
shall
forged
ere
set
out
war
But
your
road
and
our
road
lie
together
for
many
hundreds
miles
Therefore
Boromir
will
also
the
Company
valiant
man
There
remain
two
more
found
said
Elrond
These
will
consider
household
may
find
some
that
seems
good
send
But
that
will
leave
place
for
cried
Pippin
dismay
don
want
left
behind
want
with
Frodo
That
because
you
not
understand
and
cannot
imagine
what
lies
ahead
said
Elrond
Neither
does
Frodo
said
Gandalf
unexpectedly
supporting
Pippin
Nor
any
see
clearly
true
that
these
hobbits
understood
the
danger
they
would
not
dare
But
they
would
still
wish
wish
that
they
dared
and
shamed
and
happy
think
Elrond
that
this
matter
would
well
trust
rather
their
friendship
than
great
wisdom
Even
you
chose
for
Elf
lord
such
Glorfindel
could
not
storm
the
Dark
Tower
nor
open
the
road
the
Fire
the
power
that
him
You
speak
gravely
said
Elrond
but
doubt
The
Shire
forebode
not
free
now
from
peril
and
these
two
had
thought
send
back
there
messengers
what
they
could
according
the
fashion
their
country
warn
the
people
their
danger
any
case
judge
that
the
younger
these
two
Peregrin
Took
should
remain
heart
against
his
going
Then
Master
Elrond
you
will
have
lock
prison
send
home
tied
sack
said
Pippin
For
otherwise
shall
follow
the
Company
Let
then
You
shall
said
Elrond
and
sighed
Now
the
tale
Nine
filled
seven
days
the
Company
must
depart
The
Sword

marches
Mordor
Very
bright
was
that
sword
when
was
made
whole
again
the
light
the
sun
shone
redly
and
the
light
the
moon
shone
cold
and
its
edge
was
hard
and
keen
And
Aragorn
gave
new
name
and
called
Anduril
Flame
the
West
Aragorn
and
Gandalf
walked
together
sat
speaking
their
road
and
the
perils
they
would
meet
and
they
pondered
the
storied
and
figured
maps
and
books
lore
that
were
the
house
Elrond
Sometimes
Frodo
was
with
them
but
was
content
lean
their
guidance
and
spent
much
time
could
with
Bilbo
those
last
days
the
hobbits
sat
together
the
evening
the
Hall
Fire
and
there
among
many
tales
they
heard
told
full
the
lay
Beren
and
Luthien
and
the
winning
the
Great
Jewel
but
the
day
while
Merry
and
Pippin
were
out
and
about
Frodo
and
Sam
were
found
with
Bilbo
his
own
small
room
Then
Bilbo
would
read
passages
from
his
book
which
still
seemed
very
incomplete
scraps
his
verses
would
take
notes
Frodo
adventures
the
morning
the
last
day
Frodo
was
alone
with
Bilbo
and
the
old
hobbit
pulled
out
from
under
his
bed
wooden
box
lifted
the
lid
and
fumbled
inside
Here
your
sword
said
But
was
broken
you
know
took
keep
safe
but
forgotten
ask
the
smiths
could
mend
time
now
thought
perhaps
you
would
care
have
this
don
you
know
took
from
the
box
small
sword
old
shabby
leathern
scabbard
Then
drew
and
its
polished
and
well
tended
blade
glittered
suddenly
cold
and
bright
This
Sting
said
and
thrust
with
little
effort
deep
into
wooden
beam
Take
you
like
shan
want
again
expect
Frodo
accepted
gratefully
Also
there
this
said
Bilbo
bringing
out
parcel
which
seemed
rather
heavy
for
its
size
unwound
several
folds
old
cloth
and
held
small
shirt
mail
was
close
woven
many
rings
supple
almost
linen
cold
ice
and
harder
than
steel
shone
like
moonlit
silver
and
was
studded
with
white
gems
With
was
belt
pearl
and
crystal
pretty
thing
isn
said
Bilbo
moving
the
light
And
useful
dwarf
mail
that
Thorin
gave
got
back
from
Michel
Delving
before
started
and
packed
with
luggage
brought
all
the
mementoes
Journey
away
with
except
the
Ring
But
did
not
expect
use
this
and
don
need
now
except
look
sometimes
You
hardly
feel
any
weight
when
you
put

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
should
look
well
don
think
should
look
right
said
Frodo
Just
what
said
myself
said
Bilbo
But
never
mind
about
looks
You
can
wear
under
your
outer
clothes
Come
You
must
share
this
secret
with
Don
tell
anybody
else
But
should
feel
happier
knew
you
were
wearing
have
fancy
would
turn
even
the
knives
the
Black
Riders
ended
low
voice
Very
well
will
take
said
Frodo
Bilbo
put
him
and
fastened
Sting
upon
the
glittering
belt
and
then
Frodo
put
over
the
top
his
old
weather
stained
breeches
tunic
and
jacket
Just
plain
hobbit
you
look
said
Bilbo
But
there
more
about
you
now
than
appears
the
surface
Good
luck
you
turned
away
and
looked
out
the
window
trying
hum
tune
cannot
thank
you
should
Bilbo
for
this
and
for
all
your
past
kindnesses
said
Frodo
Don
try
said
the
old
hobbit
turning
round
and
slapping
him
the
back
cried
You
are
too
hard
now
slap
But
there
you
are
Hobbits
must
stick
together
and
especially
Bagginses
All
ask
return
take
much
care
yourself
you
can
and
bring
back
all
the
news
you
can
and
any
old
songs
and
tales
you
can
come
Pll
best
finish
book
before
you
return
should
like
write
the
second
book
spared
broke
off
and
turned
the
window
again
singing
softly
sit
beside
the
fire
and
think
all
that
have
seen
meadow
flowers
and
butterflies
summers
that
have
been
yellow
leaves
and
gossamer
autumns
that
there
were
with
morning
mist
and
silver
sun
and
wind
upon
hair
sit
beside
the
fire
and
think
how
the
world
will
when
winter
comes
without
spring
that
shall
ever
see
For
still
there
are
many
things
that
have
never
seen
every
wood
every
spring
there

sit
beside
the
fire
and
think
people
long
ago
and
people
who
will
see
world
that
shall
never
know
But
all
the
while
sit
and
think
times
there
were
before
listen
for
returning
feet
and
voices
the
door
was
cold
grey
day
near
the
end
December
The
East
Wind
was
streaming
through
the
bare
branches
the
trees
and
seething
the
dark
pines
the
hills
Ragged
clouds
were
hurrying
overhead
dark
and
low
the
cheerless
shadows
the
early
evening
began
fall
the
Company
made
ready
set
out
They
were
start
dusk
for
Elrond
counselled
them
journey
under
cover
night
often
they
could
until
they
were
far
from
Rivendell
You
should
fear
the
many
eyes
the
servants
Sauron
said
not
doubt
that
news
the
discomfiture
the
Riders
has
already
reached
him
and
will
filled
with
wrath
Soon
now
his
spies
foot
and
wing
will
abroad
the
northern
lands
Even
the
sky
above
you
must
beware
you
your
way
The
Company
took
little
gear
war
for
their
hope
was
secrecy
not
battle
Aragorn
had
Anduril
but
other
weapon
and
went
forth
clad
only
rusty
green
and
brown
Ranger
the
wilder
ness
Boromir
had
long
sword
fashion
like
Anduril
but
less
lineage
and
bore
also
shield
and
his
war
horn
Loud
and
clear
sounds
the
valleys
the
hills
said
and
then
let
all
the
foes
Gondor
flee
Putting
his
lips
blew
blast
and
the
echoes
leapt
from
rock
rock
and
all
that
heard
that
voice
Rivendell
sprang
their
feet
Slow
should
you
wind
that
horn
again
Boromir
said
Elrond
until
you
stand
once
more
the
borders
your
land
and
dire
need
you
Maybe
said
Boromir
But
always
have
let
horn
cry
setting
forth
and
though
thereafter
may
walk
the
shadows
will
not
forth
thief
the
night
Gimli
the
dwarf
alone
wore
openly
short
shirt
steel
rings
for
dwarves
make
light
burdens
and
his
belt
was
broad
bladed
axe
Legolas
had
bow
and
quiver
and
his
belt
long
white
knife
The
younger
hobbits
wore
the
swords
that
they
had
taken
from
the
barrow
but
Frodo
took
only
Sting
and
his
mail
coat
Bilbo
wished
remained
hidden
Gandalf
bore
his
staff
but
girt
his
side

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
was
the
elven
sword
Glamdring
the
mate
Orcrist
that
lay
now
upon
the
breast
Thorin
under
the
Lonely
Mountain
All
were
well
furnished
Elrond
with
thick
warm
clothes
and
they
had
jackets
and
cloaks
lined
with
fur
Spare
food
and
clothes
and
blankets
and
other
needs
were
laden
pony
none
other
than
the
poor
beast
that
they
had
brought
from
Bree
The
stay
Rivendell
had
worked
great
wonder
change
him
was
glossy
and
seemed
have
the
vigour
youth
was
Sam
who
had
insisted
choosing
him
declaring
that
Bill
called
him
would
pine
did
not
come
That
animal
can
nearly
talk
said
and
would
talk
stayed
here
much
longer
gave
look
plain
Pippin
could
speak
you
don
let
with
you
Sam
follow
own
Bill
was
going
the
beast
burden
yet
was
the
only
member
the
Company
that
did
not
seem
depressed
Their
farewells
had
been
said
the
great
hall
the
fire
and
they
were
only
waiting
now
for
Gandalf
who
had
not
yet
come
out
the
house
gleam
firelight
came
from
the
open
doors
and
soft
lights
were
glowing
many
windows
Bilbo
huddled
cloak
stood
silent
the
doorstep
beside
Frodo
Aragorn
sat
with
his
head
bowed
his
knees
only
Elrond
knew
fully
what
this
hour
meant
him
The
others
could
seen
grey
shapes
the
darkness
Sam
was
standing
the
pony
sucking
his
teeth
and
staring
moodily
into
the
gloom
where
the
river
roared
stonily
below
his
desire
for
adventure
was
its
lowest
ebb
Bill
lad
said
you
oughtn
have
took
with
You
could
have
stayed
here
and
the
best
hay
till
the
new
grass
comes
Bill
swished
his
tail
and
said
nothing
Sam
eased
the
pack
his
shoulders
and
went
over
anxiously
his
mind
all
the
things
that
had
stowed
wondering
had
forgotten
anything
his
chief
treasure
his
cooking
gear
and
the
little
box
salt
that
always
carried
and
refilled
when
could
good
supply
pipe
weed
but
not
near
enough
Pll
warrant
flint
and
tinder
woollen
hose
linen
various
small
belongings
his
master
that
Frodo
had
forgotten
and
Sam
had
stowed
bring
them
out
triumph
when
they
were
called
for
went
through
them
all
Rope
muttered
rope
And
only
last
night
you
said
yourself
Sam
what
about
bit
rope
You
want
you
haven
got
Well
Pll
want
can
get
now
that
moment
Elrond
came
out
with
Gandalf
and
called
the
Company
him
This
last
word
said
low
voice
The
Ring
bearer
setting
out
the
Quest
Mount
Doom
him
THE
RING
GOES

alone
any
charge
laid
neither
cast
away
the
Ring
nor
deliver
any
servant
the
Enemy
nor
indeed
let
any

save
members
the
Company
and
the
Council
and
only
then
gravest

The
others
with
him
free
companions
help
him
his
way
You
may
tarry
come
back
turn
aside
into
other
paths
chance
allows
The
further
you
the
less
easy
will
withdraw
yet
oath
bond
laid
you
further
than
you
will
For
you
not
yet
know
the
strength
your
hearts
and
you
cannot
foresee
what
each
may
meet
upon
the
road
Faithless
that
says
farewell
when
the
road
darkens
said
Gimli
Maybe
said
Elrond
but
let
him
not
vow
walk
the
dark
who
has
not
seen
the
nightfall
Yet
sworn
word
may
strengthen
quaking

said
Gimli
break
said
Elrond
Look
not
too
far
ahead
But
now
with
good
hearts
Farewell
and
may
the
blessing
Elves
and
Men
and
all
Free
Folk
with
you
May
the
stars
shine
upon
your
faces
Good
good
luck
cried
Bilbo
stuttering
with
the
cold
don
suppose
you
will
able
keep
diary
Frodo
lad
but
shall
expect
full
account
when
you
get
back
And
don
too
long
Farewell
Many
others
Elrond
household
stood
the
shadows
and
watched
them
bidding
them
farewell
with
soft
voices
There
was
laughter
and
song
music
last
they
turned
away
and
faded
silently
into
the
dusk
They
crossed
the
bridge
and
wound
slowly
the
long
steep
paths
that
led
out
the
cloven
vale
Rivendell
and
they
came
length
the
high
moor
where
the
wind
hissed
through
the
heather
Then
with
one
glance
the
Last
Homely
House
twinkling
below
them
they
strode
away
far
into
the
night
the
Ford
Bruinen
they
left
the
Road
and
turning
southwards
went
narrow
paths
among
the
folded
lands
Their
purpose
was
hold
this
course
west
the
Mountains
for
many
miles
and
days
The
country
was
much
rougher
and
more
barren
than
the
green
vale
the
Great
River
Wilderland
the
other
side
the
range
and
their
going
would
slow
but
they
hoped
this
way
escape
the
notice
unfriendly
eyes
The
spies
Sauron
had
hitherto
seldom
been
seen
this
empty
country
and
the
paths
were
little
known
except
the
people
Rivendell
Gandalf
walked
front
and
with
him
went
Aragorn
who
knew
this
land
even
the
dark
The
others
were
file
behind
and
Legolas
whose
eyes
were
keen
was
the
rearguard
The
first
part
their
journey
282
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
was
hard
and
dreary
and
Frodo
remembered
little
save
the
wind
For
many
sunless
days
icy
blast
came
from
the
Mountains
the
east
and
garment
seemed
able
keep
out
its
searching
fingers
Though
the
Company
was
well
clad
they
seldom
felt
warm
either
moving
rest
They
slept
uneasily
during
the
middle
the
day
some
hollow
the
land
hidden
under
the
tangled
thorn
bushes
that
grew
thickets
many
places
the
late
after
noon
they
were
roused
the
watch
and
took
their
chief
meal
cold
and
cheerless
rule
for
they
could
seldom
risk
the
lighting
fire
the
evening
they
went
again
always
nearly
southward
they
could
find
way
first
seemed
the
hobbits
that
although
they
walked
and
stumbled
until
they
were
weary
they
were
creeping
forward
like
snails
and
getting
nowhere
Each
day
the
land
looked
much
the
same
had
the
day
before
Yet
steadily
the
mountains
were
drawing
nearer
South
Rivendell
they
rose
ever
higher
and
bent
westwards
and
about
the
feet
the
main
range
there
was
tumbled
ever
wider
land
bleak
hills
and
deep
valleys
filled
with
turbulent
waters
Paths
were
few
and
winding
and
led
them
often
only
the
edge
some
sheer
fall
down
into
treacherous
swamps
They
had
been
fortnight
the
way
when
the
weather
changed
The
wind
suddenly
fell
and
then
veered
round
the
south
The
swift
flowing
clouds
lifted
and
melted
away
and
the
sun
came
out
pale
and
bright
There
came
cold
clear
dawn
the
end
long
stumbling
night
march
The
travellers
reached
low
ridge
crowned
with
ancient
holly
trees
whose
grey
green
trunks
seemed
have
been
built
out
the
very
stone
the
hills
Their
dark
leaves
shone
and
their
berries
glowed
red
the
light
the
rising
sun
Away
the
south
Frodo
could
see
the
dim
shapes
lofty
moun
tains
that
seemed
now
stand
across
the
path
that
the
Company
was
taking
the
left
this
high
range
rose
three
peaks
the
tallest
and
nearest
stood
like
tooth
tipped
with
snow
its
great
bare
northern
precipice
was
still
largely
the
shadow
but
where
the
sunlight
slanted
upon
glowed
red
Gandalf
stood
Frodo
side
and
looked
out
under
his
hand
have
done
well
said
have
reached
the
borders
the
country
that
Men
call
Hollin
many
Elves
lived
here
happier
days
when
Eregion
was
its
name
Five
and
forty
leagues
the
crow
flies
have
come
though
many
long
miles
further
our
feet
have
walked
The
land
and
the
weather
will
milder
now
but
perhaps
all
the
more
dangerous
Dangerous
not
real
sunrise
mighty
welcome
said
Frodo
throwing
back
his
hood
and
letting
the
morning
light
fall
his
face
THE
RING
GOES
SOUTH
283
But
the
mountains
are
ahead
said
Pippin
must
have
turned
eastwards
the
night
said
Gandalf
But
you
see
further
ahead
the
clear
light
Beyond
those
peaks
the
range
bends
round
south
west
There
are
many
maps
Elrond
house
but
suppose
you
never
thought
look
them
Yes
did
sometimes
said
Pippin
but
don
remember
them
Frodo
has
better
head
for
that
sort
thing
need
map
said
Gimli
who
had
come
with
Legolas
and
was
gazing
out
before
him
with
strange
light
his
deep
eyes
There
the
land
where
our
fathers
worked
old
and
have
wrought
the
image
those
mountains
into
many
works
metal
and
stone
and
into
many
songs
and
tales
They
stand
tall
our
dreams
Baraz
Zirak
Shathtr
Only
once
before
have
seen
them
from
afar
waking
life
but
know
them
and
their
names
for
under
them
lies
Khazad
dtim
the
Dwarrowdelf
that
now
called
the
Black
Pit
Moria
the
Elvish
tongue
Yonder
stands
Barazinbar
the
Redhorn
cruel
Caradhras
and
beyond
him
are
Silvertine
and
Cloudyhead
Celebdil
the
White
and
Fanuidhol
the
Grey
that
call
Zirakzigil
and
Bundushathtr
There
the
Misty
Mountains
divide
and
between
their
arms
lies
the
deep
shadowed
valley
which
cannot
forget
Azanulbizar
the
Dimrill
Dale
which
the
Elves
call
Nanduhirion
for
the
Dimrill
Dale
that
are
making
said
Gandalf
climb
the
pass
that
called
the
Redhorn
Gate
under
the
far
side
Caradhras
shall
come
down
the
Dimrill
Stair
into
the
deep
vale
the
Dwarves
There
lies
the
Mirrormere
and
there
the
River
Silverlode
rises
its
icy
springs
Dark
the
water
Kheled
zaram
said
Gimli
and
cold
are
the
springs
Kibil
nala
heart
trembles
the
thought
that
may
see
them
soon
May
you
have
joy
the
sight
good
dwarf
said
Gandalf
But
whatever
you
may
least
cannot
stay
that
valley
must
down
the
Silverlode
into
the
secret
woods
and
the
Great
River
and
then
paused
Yes
and
where
then
asked
Merry
the
end
the
journey
the
end
said
Gandalf
cannot
look
too
far
ahead
Let
glad
that
the
first
stage
safely
over
think
will
rest
here
not
only
today
but
tonight
well
There
wholesome
air
about
Hollin
Much
evil

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
not
now
remember
them
Only
hear
the
stones
lament
them
deep
they
delved
fair
they
wrought
high
they
builded
but
they
are
gone
They
are
gone
They
sought
the
Havens
long
ago
That
morning
they
lit
fire
deep
hollow
shrouded
great
bushes
holly
and
their
supper
breakfast
was
merrier
than
had
been
since
they
set
out
They
did
not
hurry
bed
afterwards
for
they
expected
have
all
the
night
sleep
and
they
did
not
mean
again
until
the
evening
the
next
day
Only
Aragorn
was
silent
and
restless
After
while
left
the
Company
and
wandered
the
ridge
there
stood
the
shadow
tree
looking
out
southwards
and
westwards
with
his
head
posed
was
listening
Then
returned
the
brink
the
dell
and
looked
down
the
others
laughing
and
talking
What
the
matter
Strider
Merry
called
What
are
you
looking
for
you
miss
the
East
Wind
indeed
answered
But
miss
something
have
been
the
country
Hollin
many
seasons
folk
dwell
here
now
but
many
other
creatures
live
here
all
times
especially
birds
Yet
now
all
things
but
you
are
silent
can
feel
There
sound
for
miles
about
and
your
voices
seem
make
the
ground
echo
not
understand
Gandalf
looked
with
sudden
interest
But
what
you
guess
the
reason
asked
there
more
than
surprise
seeing
four
hobbits
not
mention
the
rest
where
people
are
seldom
seen
heard
hope
that
answered
Aragorn
But
have
sense
watch
fulness
and
fear
that
have
never
had
here
before
Then
must
more
careful
said
Gandalf
you
bring
Ranger
with
you
well
pay
attention
him
especially
the
Ranger
Aragorn
must
stop
talking
aloud
rest
quietly
and
set
the
watch
was
Sam
turn
that
day
take
the
first
watch
but
Aragorn
joined
him
The
others
fell
asleep
Then
the
silence
grew
until
even
Sam
felt
The
breathing
the
sleepers
could
plainly
heard
The
swish
the
pony
tail
and
the
occasional
movements
his
feet
became
loud
noises
Sam
could
hear
his
own
joints
creaking
stirred
Dead
silence
was
around
him
and
over
all
hung
clear
blue
sky
the
Sun
rode
from
the
East
Away
the
South
dark
patch
appeared
and
grew
and
drove
north
like
flying
smoke
the
wind
What
that
Strider
don
look
like
cloud
said
Sam
whisper
Aragorn
made
answer
was
gazing
intently
the
THE
RING
GOES

sky
but
before
long
Sam
could
see
for
himself
what
was
approaching
Flocks
birds
flying
great
speed
were
wheeling
and
circling
and
traversing
all
the
land
they
were
searching
for
something
and
they
were
steadily
drawing
nearer
Lie
flat
and
still
hissed
Aragorn
pulling
Sam
down
into
the
shade
holly
bush
for
whole
regiment
birds
had
broken
away
suddenly
from
the
main
host
and
came
flying
low
straight
towards
the
ridge
Sam
thought
they
were
kind
crow
large
size
they
passed
overhead
dense
throng
that
their
shadow
followed
them
darkly
over
the
ground
below
one
harsh
croak
was
heard
Not
until
they
had
dwindled
into
the
distance
north
and
west
and
the
sky
was
again
clear
would
Aragorn
rise
Then
sprang
and
went
and
wakened
Gandalf
Regiments
black
crows
are
flying
over
all
the
land
between
the
Mountains
and
the
Greyflood
said
and
they
have
passed
over
Hollin
They
are
not
natives
here
they
are
crebain
out
Fangorn
and
Dunland
not
know
what
they
are
about
possibly
there
some
trouble
away
south
from
which
they
are
fleeing
but
think
they
are
spying
out
the
land
have
also
glimpsed
many
hawks
flying
high
the
sky
think
ought
move
again
this
evening
Hollin
longer
wholesome
for
being
watched
And
that
case
the
Redhorn
Gate
said
Gandalf
and
how
can
get
over
that
without
being
seen
cannot
imagine
But
will
think
that
when
must
for
moving
soon
dark
afraid
that
you
are
right
Luckily
our
fire
made
little
smoke
and
had
burned
low
before
the
crebain
came
said
Aragorn
must
put
out
and
not
lit
again
Well
that
isn
plague
and
nuisance
said
Pippin
The
news
fire
and
move
again
night
had
been
broken
him
soon
woke
the
late
afternoon
All
because
pack
crows
had
looked
forward
real
good
meal
tonight
something
hot
Well
you
can
looking
forward
said
Gandalf
There
may
many
unexpected
feasts
ahead
for
you
For
myself
should
like
pipe
smoke
comfort
and
warmer
feet
However
are
certain
one
thing
any
rate
will
get
warmer
get
south
Too
warm
shouldn
wonder
muttered
Sam
Frodo
But
beginning
think
time
got
sight
that
Fiery
Mountain
and
saw
the
end
the
Road
speak
thought
first
that
this
here
Redhorn
whatever
its
name
might
till
Gimli
spoke
his
piece
fair
jaw
cracker
dwarf
language
must
Maps
conveyed
nothing
Sam
mind
and
all
distances
these
strange
lands
seemed
vast
that
was
quite
out
his
reckoning
All
that
day
the
Company
remained
hiding
The
dark
birds
286
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
passed
over
now
and
again
but
the
westering
Sun
grew
red
they
disappeared
southwards
dusk
the
Company
set
out
and
turning
now
half
east
they
steered
their
course
towards
Caradhras
which
far
away
still
glowed
faintly
red
the
last
light
the
vanished
Sun
One
one
white
stars
sprang
forth
the
sky
faded
Guided
Aragorn
they
struck
good
path
looked
Frodo
like
the
remains
ancient
road
that
had
once
been
broad
and
well
planned
from
Hollin
the
mountain
pass
The
Moon
now
the
full
rose
over
the
mountains
and
cast
pale
light
which
the
shadows
stones
were
black
Many
them
looked
have
been
worked
hands
though
now
they
lay
tumbled
and
ruinous
bleak
barren
land
was
the
cold
chill
hour
before
the
first
stir
dawn
and
the
moon
was
low
Frodo
looked
the
sky
Suddenly
saw
felt
shadow
pass
over
the
high
stars
for
moment
they
faded
and
then
flashed
out
again
shivered
Did
you
see
anything
pass
over
whispered
Gandalf
who
was
just
ahead
but
felt
whatever
was
answered
may
nothing
only
wisp
thin
cloud
was
moving
fast
then
muttered
Aragorn
and
not
with
the
wind
Nothing
further
happened
that
night
The
next
morning
dawned
even
brighter
than
before
But
the
air
was
chill
again
already
the
wind
was
turning
back
towards
the
east
For
two
more
nights
they
marched
climbing
steadily
but
ever
more
slowly
their
road
wound
into
the
hills
and
the
mountains
towered
nearer
and
nearer
the
third
morning
Caradhras
rose
before
them
mighty
peak
tipped
with
snow
like
silver
but
with
sheer
naked
sides
dull
red
stained
with
blood
There
was
black
look
the
sky
and
the
sun
was
wan
The
wind
had
gone
now
round
the
north
east
Gandalf
snuffed
the
air
and
looked
back
Winter
deepens
behind
said
quietly
Aragorn
The
heights
away
north
are
whiter
than
they
were
snow
lying
far
down
their
shoulders
Tonight
shall
our
way
high
towards
the
Redhorn
Gate
may
well
seen
watchers
that
narrow
path
and
waylaid
some
evil
but
the
weather
may
prove
more
deadly
enemy
than
any
What
you
think
your
course
now
Aragorn
Frodo
overheard
these
words
and
understood
that
Gandalf
and
Aragorn
were
continuing
some
debate
that
had
begun
long
before
listened
anxiously
THE
RING
GOES
SOUTH
287
think
good
our
course
from
beginning
end
you
know
well
Gandalf
answered
Aragorn
And
perils
known
and
unknown
will
grow
But
must
and
good
our
delaying
the
passage
the
mountains
Further
south
there
are
passes
till
one
comes
the
Gap
Rohan
not
trust
that
way
since
your
news
Saruman
Who
knows
which
side
now
the
marshals
the
Horse
lords
serve
Who
knows
indeed
said
Gandalf
But
there
another
way
and
not
the
pass
Caradhras
the
dark
and
secret
way
that
have
spoken
But
let
not
speak
again
Not
yet
Say
nothing
the
others
beg
not
until
plain
that
there
other
way
must
decide
before
further
answered
Gandalf
Then
let
weigh
the
matter
our
minds
while
the
others
rest
and
sleep
said
Aragorn
the
late
afternoon
while
the
others
were
finishing
their
break
fast
Gandalf
and
Aragorn
went
aside
together
and
stood
looking
Caradhras
Its
sides
were
now
dark
and
sullen
and
its
head
was
grey
cloud
Frodo
watched
them
wondering
which
way
the
debate
would
When
they
returned
the
Company
Gandalf
spoke
and
then
knew
that
had
been
decided
face
the
weather
and
the
high
pass
was
relieved
could
not
guess
what
was
the
other
dark
and
secret
way
but
the
very
mention
had
seemed
fill
Aragorn
with
dismay
and
Frodo
was
glad
that
had
been
abandoned
From
signs
that
have
seen
lately
said
Gandalf
fear
that
the
Redhorn
Gate
may
watched
and
also
have
doubts
the
weather
that
coming
behind
Snow
may
come
must
with
all
the
speed
that
can
Even
will
take
more
than
two
marches
before
reach
the
top
the
pass
Dark
will
come
early
this
evening
must
leave
soon
you
can
get
ready
will
add
word
advice
may
said
Boromir
was
born
under
the
shadow
the
White
Mountains
and
know
something
journeys
the
high
places
shall
meet
bitter
cold
worse
before
come
down
the
other
side
will
not
help
keep
secret
that
are
frozen
death
When
leave
here
where
there
are
still
few
trees
and
bushes
each
should
carry
faggot
wood
large
can
bear
And
Bill
could
take
bit
more
couldn
you
lad
said
Sam
The
pony
looked
him
mournfully
Very
well
said
Gandalf
But
must
not
use
the
wood
not
unless
choice
between
fire
and
death
288
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
The
Company
set
out
again
with
good
speed
first
but
soon
their
way
became
steep
and
difficult
The
twisting
and
climbing
road
had
many
places
almost
disappeared
and
was
blocked
with
many
fallen
stones
The
night
grew
deadly
dark
under
great
clouds
bitter
wind
swirled
among
the
rocks
midnight
they
had
climbed
the
knees
the
great
mountains
The
narrow
path
now
wound
under
sheer
wall
cliffs
the
left
above
which
the
grim
flanks
Caradhras
towered
invisible
the
gloom
the
right
was
gulf
darkness
where
the
land
fell
suddenly
into
deep
ravine
Laboriously
they
climbed
sharp
slope
and
halted
for
moment
the
top
Frodo
felt
soft
touch
his
face
put
out
his
arm
and
saw
the
dim
white
flakes
snow
settling
his
sleeve
They
went
But
before
long
the
snow
was
falling
fast
filling
all
the
air
and
swirling
into
Frodo
eyes
The
dark
bent
shapes
Gandalf
and
Aragorn
only
pace
two
ahead
could
hardly
seen
don
like
this
all
panted
Sam
just
behind
Snow
all
right
fine
morning
but
like
bed
while
falling
wish
this
lot
would
off
Hobbiton
Folk
might
welcome
there
Except
the
high
moors
the
Northfarthing
heavy
fall
was
rare
the
Shire
and
was
regarded
pleasant
event
and
chance
for
fun
living
hobbit
save
Bilbo
could
remember
the
Fell
Winter
1311
when
white
wolves
invaded
the
Shire
over
the
frozen
Brandywine
Gandalf
halted
Snow
was
thick
his
hood
and
shoulders
was
already
ankle
deep
about
his
boots
This
what
feared
said
What
you
say
now
Aragorn
That
feared
too
Aragorn
answered
but
less
than
other
things
knew
the
risk
snow
though
seldom
falls
heavily
far
south
save
high
the
mountains
But
are
not
high
yet
are
still
far
down
where
the
paths
are
usually
open
all
the
winter
wonder
this
contrivance
the
Enemy
said
Boromir
They
say
land
that
can
govern
the
storms
the
Mountains
Shadow
that
stand
upon
the
borders
Mordor
has
strange
powers
and
many
allies
His
arm
has
grown
long
indeed
said
Gimli
can
draw
snow
down
from
the
North
trouble
here
three
hundred
leagues
away
His
arm
has
grown
long
said
Gandalf
While
they
were
halted
the
wind
died
down
and
the
snow
slack
ened
until
almost
ceased
They
tramped
again
But
they
had
not
gone
more
than
furlong
when
the
storm
returned
with
fresh
fury
The
wind
whistled
and
the
snow
became
blinding
blizzard
Soon
even
Boromir
found
hard
keep
going
The
hobbits
bent
nearly
double
toiled
along
behind
the
taller
folk
but
was
plain
THE
RING
GOES
SOUTH
289
that
they
could
not
much
further
the
snow
continued
Frodo
feet
felt
like
lead
Pippin
was
dragging
behind
Even
Gimli
stout
any
dwarf
could
was
grumbling
trudged
The
Company
halted
suddenly
they
had
come
agree
ment
without
any
words
being
spoken
They
heard
eerie
noises
the
darkness
round
them
may
have
been
only
trick
the
wind
the
cracks
and
gullies
the
rocky
wall
but
the
sounds
were
those
shrill
cries
and
wild
howls
laughter
Stones
began
fall
from
the
mountain
side
whistling
over
their
heads
crashing
the
path
beside
them
Every
now
and
again
they
heard
dull
rumble
great
boulder
rolled
down
from
hidden
heights
above
cannot
further
tonight
said
Boromir
Let
those
call
the
wind
who
will
there
are
fell
voices
the
air
and
these
stones
are
aimed
call
the
wind
said
Aragorn
But
that
does
not
make
what
you
say
untrue
There
are
many
evil
and
unfriendly
things
the
world
that
have
little
love
for
those
that
two
legs
and
yet
are
not
league
with
Sauron
but
have
purposes
their
own
Some
have
been
this
world
longer
than
Caradhras
was
called
the
Cruel
and
had
ill
name
said
Gimli
long
years
ago
when
rumour
Sauron
had
not
been
heard
these
lands
matters
little
who
the
enemy
cannot
beat
off
his
attack
said
Gandalf
But
what
can
cried
Pippin
miserably
was
leaning
Merry
and
Frodo
and
was
shivering
Either
stop
where
are
back
said
Gandalf
good
going
Only
little
higher
remember
rightly
this
path
leaves
the
cliff
and
runs
into
wide
shallow
trough
the
bottom
long
hard
slope
should
have
shelter
there
from
snow
stones
anything
else
And
good
going
back
while
the
storm
holds
said
Aragorn
have
passed
place
the
way
that
offered
more
shelter
than
this
cliff
wall
are
under
now
Shelter
muttered
Sam
this
shelter
then
one
wall
and
roof
make
house
The
Company
now
gathered
together
close
the
cliff
they
could
faced
southwards
and
near
the
bottom
leaned
out
little
that
they
hoped
would
give
them
some
protection
from
the
northerly
wind
and
from
the
falling
stones
But
eddying
blasts
swirled
round
them
from
every
side
and
the
snow
flowed
down
ever
denser
clouds
They
huddled
together
with
their
backs
the
wall
Bill
the
pony

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
stood
patiently
but
dejectedly
front
the
hobbits
and
screened
them
little
but
before
long
the
drifting
snow
was
above
his
hocks
and
went
mounting
they
had
had
larger
companions
the
hobbits
would
soon
have
been
entirely
buried
great
sleepiness
came
over
Frodo
felt
himself
sinking
fast
into
warm
and
hazy
dream
thought
fire
was
heating
his
toes
and
out
the
shadows
the
other
side
the
hearth
heard
Bilbo
voice
speaking
don
think
much
your

said
Snowstorms
Fanuary
the
twelfth
there
was
need
come
back
report
that
But
wanted
rest
and
sleep
Bilbo
Frodo
answered
with
effort
when
felt
himself
shaken
and
came
back
painfully
wakeful
ness
Boromir
had
lifted
him
off
the
ground
out
nest
snow
This
will
the
death
the
halflings
Gandalf
said
Boromir
useless
sit
here
until
the
snow
goes
over
our
heads
must
something
save
ourselves
Give
them
this
said
Gandalf
searching
his
pack
and
drawing
out
leathern
flask
Just
mouthful
each
for
all
very
precious
miruvor
the
cordial
Imladris
Elrond
gave
our
parting
Pass
round
soon
Frodo
had
swallowed
little
the
warm
and
fragrant
liquor
felt
new
strength
heart
and
the
heavy
drowsiness
left
his
limbs
The
others
also
revived
and
found
fresh
hope
and
vigour
But
the
snow
did
not
relent
whirled
about
them
thicker
than
ever
and
the
wind
blew
louder
What
you
say
fire
asked
Boromir
suddenly
The
choice
seems
near
now
between
fire
and
death
Gandalf
Doubtless
shall
hidden
from
all
unfriendly
eyes
when
the
snow
has
covered
but
that
will
not
help
You
may
make
fire
you
can
answered
Gandalf
there
are
any
watchers
that
can
endure
this
storm
then
they
can
see
fire
But
though
they
had
brought
wood
and
kindlings
the
advice
Boromir
passed
the
skill
Elf
even
Dwarf
strike
flame
that
would
hold
amid
the
swirling
wind
catch
the
wet
fuel
last
reluctantly
Gandalf
himself
took
hand
Picking
faggot
held
aloft
for
moment
and
then
with
word
command
naur
edraith
ammen
thrust
the
end
his
staff
into
the
midst
once
great
spout
green
and
blue
flame
sprang
out
and
the
wood
flared
and
sputtered
there
are
any

then
least
revealed
them
said
have
written
Gandalf
here
signs
that
all
can
read
from
Rivendell
the
mouths
Anduin
But
the
Company
cared
longer
for
watchers
unfriendly
eyes
Their
hearts
were
rejoiced
see
the
light
the
fire
The
wood
THE
RING
GOES
SOUTH
291
burned
merrily
and
though
all
round
the
snow
hissed
and
pools
slush
crept
under
their
feet
they
warmed
their
hands
gladly
the
blaze
There
they
stood
stooping
circle
round
the
little
dancing
and
blowing
flames
red
light
was
their
tired
and
anxious
faces
behind
them
the
night
was
like
black
wall
But
the
wood
was
burning
fast
and
the
snow
still
fell
The
fire
burned
low
and
the
last
faggot
was
thrown
The
night
getting
old
said
Aragorn
The
dawn
not
far
off
any
dawn
can
pierce
these
clouds
said
Gimli
Boromir
stepped
out
the
circle
and
stared
into
the
blackness
The
snow
growing
less
said
and
the
wind
quieter
Frodo
gazed
wearily
the
flakes
still
falling
out
the
dark
revealed
white
for
moment
the
light
the
dying
fire
but
for
long
time
could
see
sign
their
slackening
Then
suddenly
sleep
was
beginning
creep
over
him
again
was
aware
that
the
wind
had
indeed
fallen
and
the
flakes
were
becoming
larger
and
fewer
Very
slowly
dim
light
began
grow
last
the
snow
stopped
altogether
the
light
grew
stronger
showed
silent
shrouded
world
Below
their
refuge
were
white
humps
and
domes
and
shapeless
deeps
beneath
which
the
path
that
they
had
trodden
was
altogether
lost
but
the
heights
above
were
hidden
great
clouds
still
heavy
with
the
threat
snow
Gimli
looked
and
shook
his
head
Caradhras
has
not
forgiven
said
has
more
snow
yet
fling
The
sooner
back
and
down
the
better
this
all
agreed
but
their
retreat
was
now
difficult
might
well
prove
impossible
Only
few
paces
from
the
ashes
their
fire
the
snow
lay
many
feet
deep
higher
than
the
heads
the
hobbits
places
had
been
scooped
and
piled
the
wind
into
great
drifts
against
the
cliff
Gandalf
would
before
with
bright
flame
might
melt
path
for
you
said
Legolas
The
storm
had
troubled
him
little
and
alone
the
Company
remained
still
light
heart
Elves
could
fly
over
mountains
they
might
fetch
the
Sun
save
answered
Gandalf
But
must
have
something
work
cannot
burn
snow
Well
said
Boromir
when
heads
are
loss
bodies
must
serve
say
country
The
strongest
must
seek
way
See
Though
all
now
snow
clad
our
path
came
turned
about
that
shoulder
rock
down
yonder
was
there
that
the
snow
first
began
burden
could
reach
that
point
maybe
would
prove
easier
beyond
more
than
furlong
off
guess
292
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Then
let
force
path
thither
you
and
said
Aragorn
Aragorn
was
the
tallest
the
Company
but
Boromir
little
less
height
was
broader
and
heavier
build
led
the
way
and
Aragorn
followed
him
Slowly
they
moved
off
and
were
soon
toiling
heavily
places
the
snow
was
breast
high
and
often
Boromir
seemed
swimming
burrowing
with
his
great
arms
rather
than
walking
Legolas
watched
them
for
while
with
smile
upon
his
lips
and
then
turned
the
others
The
strongest
must
seek
way
say
your
But
say
let
ploughman
plough
but
choose
otter
for
swimming
and
for
running
light
over
grass
and
leaf
over
snow
Elf
With
that
sprang
forth
nimbly
and
then
Frodo
noticed
for
the
first
time
though
had
long
known
that
the
Elf
had
boots
but
wore
only
light
shoes
always
did
and
his
feet
made
little
imprint
the
snow
Farewell
said
Gandalf
find
the
Sun
Then
swift
runner
over
firm
sand
shot
away
and
quickly
overtaking
the
toiling
men
with
wave
his
hand
passed
them
and
sped
into
the
distance
and
vanished
round
the
rocky
turn
The
others
waited
huddled
together
watching
until
Boromir
and
Aragorn
dwindled
into
black
specks
the
whiteness
length
they
too
passed
from
sight
The
time
dragged
The
clouds
lowered
and
now
few
flakes
snow
came
curling
down
again
hour
maybe
went
though
seemed
far
longer
and
then
last
they
saw
Legolas
coming
back
the
same
time
Boromir
and
Aragorn
reappeared
round
the
bend
far
behind
him
and
came
labouring
the
slope
Well
cried
Legolas
ran

not
brought

She

feet
There
the
greatest
wind
drift
all
just
beyond
the
turn
and
there
our
Strong
Men
were
almost
buried
They
despaired
until
returned
and
told
them
that
the
drift
was
little
wider
than
wall
And
the
other
side
the
snow
suddenly
grows
less
while
further
down
more
than

said
growled
Gimli
was
ordinary
storm
the
ill
will
Caradhras
does
not
love
Elves
and
Dwarves
and
that
drift
was
laid
cut
off
our
escape
But
happily
your
Caradhras
has
forgotten
that
you
have
Men
with
you
said
Boromir
who
came
that
moment
And
doughty
Men
too
may
say
though
lesser
men
with

might
have
THE

served
you
better
Still
have
thrust

through
the

and
for
that

grateful

Elves
But
how
are
get
down
there
even
you
have
cut
through
the
drift
said
Pippin
voicing
the
thought
all
the
hobbits
Have
hope
said
Boromir
weary
but
still
have
some
strength
left
and
Aragorn
too
will
bear
the
little
folk
The
others
doubt
will
make
shift
tread
the
path
behind
Come
Master
Peregrin
will
begin
with
you
lifted
the
hobbit
Cling
back
shall
need
arms
said
and
strode
forward
Aragorn
with
Merry
came
behind
Pippin
marvelled
his
strength
seeing
the
passage
that
had
already
forced
with
other
tool
than
his
great
limbs
Even
now
burdened
was
was
widening
the
track
for
those
who
followed
thrusting
the
snow
aside
went
They
came
length
the
great
drift
was
flung
across
the
mountain
path
like
sheer
and
sudden
wall
and
its
crest
sharp
shaped
with
knives
reared
more
than
twice
the
height
Boro
mir
but
through
the
middle
passage
had
been
beaten
rising
and
falling
like
bridge
the
far
side
Merry
and
Pippin
were
set
down
and
there
they
waited
with
Legolas
for
the
rest
the
Company
arrive
After
while
Boromir
returned
carrying
Sam
Behind
the
narrow
but
now
well
trodden
track
came
Gandalf
leading
Bill
with
Gimli
perched
among
the
baggage
Last
came
Aragorn
carrying
Frodo
They
passed
through
the
lane
but
hardly
had
Frodo
touched
the
ground
when
with
deep
rumble
there
rolled
down
fall
stones
and
slithering
snow
The
spray
half
blinded
the
Company
they
crouched
against
the
cliff
and
when
the
air
cleared
again
they
saw
that
the
path
was
blocked
behind
them
Enough
enough
cried
Gimli
are
departing
quickly
may
And
indeed
with
that
last
stroke
the
malice
the
mountain
seemed
expended
Caradhras
was
satisfied
that
the
invaders
had
been
beaten
off
and
would
not
dare
return
The
threat
snow
lifted
the
clouds
began
break
and
the
light
grew
broader
Legolas
had
reported
they
found
that
the
snow
became
steadily
more
shallow
they
went
down
that
even
the
hobbits
could
trudge
along
Soon
they
all
stood
once
more
the
flat
shelf
the
head
the
steep
slope
where
they
had
felt
the
first
flakes
snow
the
night
before
The
morning
was
now
far
advanced
From
the
high
place
they
looked
back
westwards
over
the
lower
lands
Far
away
the
tumble
country
that
lay
the
foot
the
mountain
was
the
dell
from
which
they
had
started
climb
the
pass
Frodo
legs
ached
was
chilled
the
bone
and
hungry
and
294
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
his
head
was
dizzy
thought
the
long
and
painful
march
downhill
Black
specks
swam
before
his
eyes
rubbed
them
but
the
black
specks
remained
the
distance
below
him
but
still
high
above
the
lower
foothills
dark
dots
were
circling
the
air
The
birds
again
said
Aragorn
pointing
down
That
cannot
helped
now
said
Gandalf
Whether
they
are
good
evil
have
nothing
with
all
must
down
once
Not
even
the
knees
Caradhras
will
wait
for
another
night
fall
cold
wind
flowed
down
behind
them
they
turned
their
backs
the
Redhorn
Gate
and
stumbled
wearily
down
the
slope
Caradhras
had
defeated
them
Chapter
JOURNEY
THE
DARK
was
evening
and
the
grey
light
was
again
waning
fast
when
they
halted
for
the
night
They
were
very
weary
The
mountains
were
veiled
deepening
dusk
and
the
wind
was
cold
Gandalf
spared
them
one
more
mouthful
each
the
miruvor
Rivendell
When
they
had
eaten
some
food
called
council
cannot
course
again
tonight
said
The
attack
the
Redhorn
Gate
has
tired
out
and
must
rest
here
for
while
And
then
where
are
asked
Frodo
still
have
our
journey
and
our
errand
before
answered
Gandalf
have
choice
but
return
Rivendell
Pippin
face
brightened
visibly
the
mere
mention
return
Rivendell
Merry
and
Sam
looked
hopefully
But
Aragorn
and
Boromir
made
sign
Frodo
looked
troubled
wish
was
back
there
said
But
how
can
return
without
shame
unless
there
indeed
other
way
and
are
already
defeated
You
are
right
Frodo
said
Gandalf
back
admit
defeat
and
face
worse
defeat
come
back
now
then
the
Ring
must
remain
there
shall
not
able
set
out
again
Then
sooner
later
Rivendell
will
besieged
and
after
brief
and
bitter
time
will
destroyed
The
Ringwraiths
are
deadly
enemies
but
they
are
only
shadows
yet
the
power
and
terror
they
would
possess
the
Ruling
Ring
was
their
master
hand
again
Then
must
there
way
said
Frodo
with
sigh
Sam
sank
back
into
gloom
There
way
that
may
attempt
said
Gandalf
thought
from
the
beginning
when
first
considered
this
journey
that
should
try
But
not
pleasant
way
and
have
not
spoken
the
Company
before
Aragorn
was
against
until
the
pass
over
the
mountains
had
least
been
tried
worse
road
than
the
Redhorn
Gate
then
must
evil
indeed
said
Merry
But
you
had
better
tell
about
and
let
know
the
worst
once
The
road
that
speak
leads
the
Mines
Moria
said
Gandalf
Only
Gimli
lifted
his
head
smouldering
fire
was
his
eyes
all
the
others
dread
fell
the
mention
that
name
Even
the
hobbits
was
legend
vague
fear
296
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
The
road
may
lead
Moria
but
how
can
hope
that
will
lead
through
Moria
said
Aragorn
darkly
name
ill
omen
said
Boromir
Nor
see
the
need
there
cannot
cross
the
mountains
let
journey
south
wards
until
come
the
Gap
Rohan
where
men
are
friendly
people
taking
the
road
that
followed
way
hither
might
pass
and
cross
the
Isen
into
Langstrand
and
Lebennin
and
come
Gondor
from
the
regions
nigh
the
sea
Things
have
changed
since
you
came
north
Boromir
answered
Gandalf
Did
you
not
hear
what
told
you
Saruman
With
him
may
have
business
own
ere
all
over
But
the
Ring
must
not
come
near
Isengard
that
can
any
means
prevented
The
Gap
Rohan
closed
while
with
the
Bearer
for
the
longer
road
cannot
afford
the
time
might
spend
year
such
journey
and
should
pass
through
many
lands
that
are
empty
and
harbourless
Yet
they
would
not
safe
The
watchful
eyes
both
Saruman
and
the
Enemy
are
them
When
you
came
north
Boromir
you
were
the
Enemy
eyes
only
one
stray
wanderer
from
the
South
and
matter
small
concern
him
his
mind
was
busy
with
the
pursuit
the
Ring
But
you
return
now
member
the
Ring
Company
and
you
are
peril
long
you
remain
with
The
danger
will
increase
with
every
league
that
south
under
the
naked
sky
Since
our
open
attempt
the
mountain
pass
our
plight
has
become
more
desperate
fear
see
now
little
hope
not
soon
vanish
from
sight
for
while
and
cover
our
trail
Therefore
advise
that
should
neither
over
the
mountains
nor
round
them
but
under
them
That
road
any
rate
that
the
Enemy
will
least
expect
take
not

what
expects
said
Boromir
may
watch
all
roads
likely
and
unlikely
that
case

Moria

hardly
better
than
knocking
the

The

You

what

when
you

you

Those

The

And

Gandalf

You

Frodo

neither

the

Gandalf
beg
that

Gandalf

the

How
the

howls
these
words
all
fell
into
silent
thought
They
heard
the
wind
hissing
among
the
rocks
and
trees
and
there
was
howling
and
wailing
round
them
the
empty
spaces
the

Suddenly
Aragorn
leapt

How

howling
with

The

For
their
defence
the
night
the
Company
climbed
the
top
the
small
hill
under
which
they
had
been
sheltering
was
crowned
with
knot
old
and
twisted
trees
about
which
lay
broken
circle
boulder
stones
the
midst
this
they
lit
fire
for
there
was
hope
that
darkness
and
silence
would
keep
their
trail
from
dis
covery
the
hunting
packs
Round
the
fire
they
sat
and
those
that
were
not
guard
dozed
uneasily
Poor
Bill
the
pony
trembled
and
sweated
where
stood
The
howling
the
wolves
was
now
all
round
them
sometimes
nearer
and
sometimes
further
off
the
dead
night
many
shining
eyes
were
seen
peering
over
the
brow
the
hill
Some
advanced
almost
the
ring
stones
gap
the
circle
great
dark
wolf
shape
could
seen
halted
gazing
them
shuddering
howl
broke
from
him
were
captain
summoning
his
pack
the
assault
Gandalf
stood
and
strode
forward
holding
his
staff
aloft
Listen
Hound
Sauron
cried
Gandalf
here
Fly
you
value
your
foul
skin
will
shrivel
you
from
tail
snout
you
come
within
this
ring
The
wolf
snarled
and
sprang
towards
them
with
great
leap
that
moment
there
was
sharp
twang
Legolas
had
loosed
his
bow
There
was
hideous
yell
and
the
leaping
shape
thudded
the
ground
the
Elvish
arrow
had
pierced
its
throat
The
watching
eyes
were
suddenly
extinguished
Gandalf
and
Aragorn
strode
forward
but
the
hill
was
deserted
the
hunting
packs
had
fled
All
about
them
the
darkness
grew
silent
and
cry
came
the
sighing
wind
The
night
was
old
and
westward
the
waning
moon
was
setting
gleaming
fitfully
through
the
breaking
clouds
Suddenly
Frodo
started
JOURNEY
THE
DARK
299
from
sleep
Without
warning
storm
howls
broke
out
fierce
and
wild
all
about
the
camp
great
host
Wargs
had
gathered
silently
and
was
now
attacking
them
from
every
side
once
Fling
fuel
the
fire
cried
Gandalf
the
hobbits
Draw
your
blades
and
stand
back
back
the
leaping
light
the
fresh
wood
blazed
Frodo
saw
many
grey
shapes
spring
over
the
ring
stones
More
and
more
followed
Through
the
throat
one
huge
leader
Aragorn
passed
his
sword
with
thrust
with
great
sweep
Boromir
hewed
the
head
off
another
Beside
them
Gimli
stood
with
his
stout
legs
apart
wielding
his
dwarf
axe
The
bow
Legolas
was
singing
the
wavering
firelight
Gandalf
seemed
suddenly
grow
rose
great
menacing
shape
like
the
monument
some
ancient
king
stone
set
upon
hill
Stooping
like
cloud
lifted
burning
branch
and
strode
meet
the
wolves
They
gave
back
before
him
High
the
air
tossed
the
blazing
brand
flared
with
sudden
white
radiance
like
lightning
and
his
voice
rolled
like
thunder
Naur
edraith
ammen
Naur
dan
ngaurhoth
cried
There
was
roar
and
crackle
and
the
tree
above
him
burst
into
leaf
and
bloom
blinding
flame
The
fire
leapt
from
tree
top
tree
top
The
whole
hill
was
crowned
with
dazzling
light
The
swords
and
knives
the
defenders
shone
and
flickered
The
last
arrow
Legolas
kindled
the
air
flew
and
plunged
burning
into
the
heart
great
wolf
chieftain
All
the
others
fled
Slowly
the
fire
died
till
nothing
was
left
but
falling
ash
and
sparks
bitter
smoke
curled
above
the
burned
tree
stumps
and
blew
darkly
from
the
hill
the
first
light
dawn
came
dimly
the
sky
Their
enemies
were
routed
and
did
not
return
What
did
tell
you
Pippin
said
Sam
sheathing
his
sword
Wolves
won
get
him
That
was
eye
opener
and
mistake
Nearly
singed
the
hair
off
head
When
the
full
light
the
morning
came
signs
the
wolves
were
found
and
they
looked
vain
for
the
bodies
the
dead
trace
the
fight
remained
but
the
charred
trees
and
the
arrows
Legolas
lying
the
hill
top
All
were
undamaged
save
one
which
only
the
point
was
left
feared
said
Gandalf
These
were
ordinary
wolves
hunting
for
food
the
wilderness
Let
eat
quickly
and
That
day
the
weather
changed
again
almost
was
the
command
some
power
that
had
longer
any
use
for
snow
since
they
had
retreated
from
the
pass
power
that
wished
now
have
clear
light
which
things
that
moved
the
wild
could
seen
from
far
away
The
wind
had
been
turning
through
north

THE
LORD

north
west
during
the
night
and
now
failed
The
clouds
vanished
southwards
and
the
sky
was
opened
high
and
blue
they
stood
upon
the
hillside
ready
depart
pale
sunlight
gleamed
over
the
mountain
tops
must
reach
the
doors
before
sunset
said
Gandalf
fear
shall
not
reach
them
all
not
far
but
our
path
may
winding
for
here
Aragorn
cannot
guide
has
seldom
walked
this
country
and
only
once
have
been
under
the
west
wall
Moria
and
that
was
long
ago
There
lies
said
pointing
away
south
eastwards
where
the
mountains
sides
fell
sheer
into
the
shadows
their
feet
the
distance
could
dimly
seen
line
bare
cliffs
and
their
midst
taller
than
the
rest
one
great
grey
wall
When
left
the
pass
led
you
southwards
and
not
back
our
starting
point
some
you
may
have
noticed
well
that
did
for
now
have
several
miles
less
cross
and
haste
needed
Let
not
know
which
hope
said
Boromir
grimly
that
Gandalf
will
find
what
seeks
that
coming
the
cliff
shall
find
the
gates
lost
for
ever
All
choices
seem
ill
and
caught
between
wolves
and
the
wall
the
likeliest
chance
Lead
Gimli
now
walked
ahead
the
wizard
side
eager
was
come
Moria
Together
they
led
the
Company
back
towards
the
mountains
The
only
road
old
Moria
from
the
west
had
lain
along
the
course
stream
the
Sirannon
that
ran
out
from
the
feet
the
cliffs
near
where
the
doors
had
stood
But
either
Gandalf
was
astray
else
the
land
had
changed
recent
years
for
did
not
strike
the
stream
where
looked
find
only
few
miles
southwards
from
their
start
The
morning
was
passing
towards
noon
and
still
the
Company
wandered
and
scrambled
barren
country
red
stones
Nowhere
could
they
see
any
gleam
water
hear
any
sound
All
was
bleak
and
dry
Their
hearts
sank
They
saw
living
thing
and
not
bird
was
the
sky
but
what
the
night
would
bring
caught
them
that
lost
land
none
them
cared
think
Suddenly
Gimli
who
had
pressed
ahead
called
back
them
was
standing
knoll
and
pointing
the
right
Hurrying
they
saw
below
them
deep
and
narrow
channel
was
empty
and
silent
and
hardly
trickle
water
flowed
among
the
brown
and
red
stained
stones
its
bed
but
the
near
side
there
was
path
much
broken
and
decayed
that
wound
its
way
among
the
ruined
walls
and
paving
stones
ancient
highroad
Here
last
said
Gandalf
This
where
the
stream
ran
Sirannon
the
Gate
stream
they
used
call
But
what
has
JOURNEY
THE
DARK
301
happened
the
water
cannot
guess
used
swift
and
noisy
Come
must
hurry
are
late
The
Company
were
footsore
and
tired
but
they
trudged
doggedly
along
the
rough
and
winding
track
for
many
miles
The
sun
turned
from
the
noon
and
began
west
After
brief
halt
and
hasty
meal
they
went
again
Before
them
the
mountains
frowned
but
their
path
lay
deep
trough
land
and
they
could
see
only
the
higher
shoulders
and
the
far
eastward
peaks
length
they
came
sharp
bend
There
the
road
which
had
been
veering
southwards
between
the
brink
the
channel
and
steep
fall
the
land
the
left
turned
and
went
due
east
again
Rounding
the
corner
they
saw
before
them
low
cliff
some
five
fathoms
high
with
broken
and
jagged
top
Over
trickling
water
dripped
through
wide
cleft
that
seemed
have
been
carved
out
fall
that
had
once
been
strong
and
full
Indeed
things
have
changed
said
Gandalf
But
there
mis
taking
the
place
There
all
that
remains
the
Stair
Falls
remember
right
there
was
flight
steps
cut
the
rock
their
side
but
the
main
road
wound
away
left
and
climbed
with
several
loops
the
level
ground
the
top
There
used
shallow
valley
beyond
the
falls
right
the
Walls
Moria
and
the
Siran
non
flowed
through
with
the
road
beside
Let
and
see
what
things
are
like
now
They
found
the
stone
steps
without
difficulty
and
Gimli
sprang
swiftly
them
followed
Gandalf
and
Frodo
When
they
reached
the
top
they
saw
that
they
could
further
that
way
and
the
reason
for
the
drying
the
Gate
stream
was
revealed
Behind
them
the
sinking
Sun
filled
the
cool
western
sky
with
glimmering
gold
Before
them
stretched
dark
still
lake
Neither
sky
nor
sunset
was
reflected
its
sullen
surface
The
Sirannon
had
been
dammed
and
had
filled
all
the
valley
Beyond
the
ominous
water
were
reared
vast
cliffs
their
stern
faces
pallid
the
fading
light
final
and
impass
able
sign
gate
entrance
not
fissure
crack
could
Frodo
see
the
frowning
stone
There
are
the
Walls
Moria
said
Gandalf
pointing
across
the
water
And
there
the
Gate
stood
once
upon
time
the
Elven
Door
the
end
the
road
from
Hollin
which
have
come
But
this
way
blocked
None
the
Company
guess
will
wish
swim
this
gloomy
water
the
end
the
day
has
unwholesome
look
must
find
way
round
the
northern
edge
said
Gimli
The
first
thing
for
the
Company
climb
the
main
path
and
see
where
that
will
lead
Even
there
were
lake
could
not
get

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
But
any
case
cannot
take
the
poor
beast
into
the
Mines
said
Gandalf
The
road
under
the
mountains
dark
road
and
there
are
places
narrow
and
steep
which
cannot
tread
even
can
Poor
old
Bill
said
Frodo
had
not
thought
that
And
poor
Sam
wonder
what
will
say
sorry
said
Gandalf
Poor
Bill
has
been
useful
companion
and
goes
heart
turn
him
adrift
now
would
have
travelled
lighter
and
brought
animal
least
all
this
one
that
Sam
fond
had
had
way
feared
all
along
that
should
obliged
take
this
road
The
day
was
drawing
its
end
and
cold
stars
were
glinting
the
sky
high
above
the
sunset
when
the
Company
with
all
the
speed
they
could
climbed
the
slopes
and
reached
the
side
the
lake
breadth
looked
more
than
two
three
furlongs
the
widest
point
How
far
stretched
away
southward
they
could
not
see
the
failing
light
but
its
northern
end
was
more
than
half
mile
from
where
they
stood
and
between
the
stony
ridges
that
enclosed
the
valley
and
the
water
edge
there
was
rim
open
ground
They
hurried
forward
for
they
had
still
mile
two
before
they
could
reach
the
point
the
far
shore
that
Gandalf
was
making
for
and
then
had
still
find
the
doors
When
they
came
the
northernmost
corner
the
lake
they
found
narrow
creek
that
barred
their
way
was
green
and
stagnant
thrust
out
like
slimy
arm
towards
the
enclosing
hills
Gimli
strode
forward
undeterred
and
found
that
the
water
was
shallow
more
than
ankle
deep
the
edge
Behind
him
they
walked
file
threading
their
way
with
care
for
under
the
weedy
pools
were
sliding
and
greasy
stones
and
footing
was
treacherous
Frodo
shuddered
with
disgust
the
touch
the
dark
unclean
water
his
feet
Sam
the
last
the
Company
led
Bill
the
dry
ground
the
far
side
there
came
soft
sound
swish
followed
plop
fish
had
disturbed
the
still
surface
the
water
Turning
quickly
they
saw
ripples
black
edged
with
shadow
the
waning
light
great
rings
were
widening
outwards
from
point
far
out
the
lake
There
was
bubbling
noise
and
then
silence
The
dusk
deepened
and
the
last
gleams
the
sunset
were
veiled
cloud
Gandalf
now
pressed
great
pace
and
the
others
followed
quickly
they
could
They
reached
the
strip
dry
land
between
the
lake
and
the
cliffs
was
narrow
often
hardly
dozen
yards
across
and
encumbered
with
fallen
rock
and
stones
but
they
found
way
hugging
the
cliff
and
keeping
far
from
the
dark
water
they
might
mile
southwards
along
the
shore
they
came
upon
holly
trees
Stumps
and
dead
boughs
were
rotting
the
shallows
the

remains
seemed
old
thickets
hedge
that
had
once
lined
the
road
across
the
drowned
valley
But
close
under
the
cliff
there
stood
still
strong
and
living
two
tall
trees
larger
than
any
trees
holly
that
Frodo
had
ever
seen
imagined
Their
great
roots
spread
from
the
wall
the
water
Under
the
looming
cliffs
they
had
looked
like
mere
bushes
when
seen
far
off
from
the
top
the
Stair
but
now
they
towered
overhead
stiff
dark
and
silent
throwing
deep
night
shadows
about
their
feet
standing
like
sentinel
pillars
the
end
the
road
Well
here
are
last
said
Gandalf
Here
the
Elven
way
from
Hollin
ended
Holly
was
the
token
the
people
that
land
and
they
planted
here
mark
the
end
their
domain
for
the
West
door
was
made
chiefly
for
their
use
their
traffic
with
the
Lords
Moria
Those
were
happier
days
when
there
was
still
close
friendship
times
between
folk
different
race
even
between
Dwarves
and
Elves
was
not
the
fault
the
Dwarves
that
the
friendship
waned
said
Gimli

not
heard
that

the
Elves

But

Turning
the

said
While
searching
will
you
each
make
ready
enter
the

For
here
fear

say
farewell
our
good

You
must
lay
aside
much
the

that

you

not

nor
hope
when

Instead
each
must
take
share
what
the

carried
especially
the

and
the

But
you
can
leave
poor

Gandalf
cried
Sam
angry

After

Sam
said
the

But
when

you

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
There
Sam
will
have
quite
much
chance
escaping
wolves
and
getting
home
have
Sam
stood
sullenly
the
pony
and
returned
answer
Bill
seeming
understand
well
what
was
going
nuzzled
him
putting
his
nose
Sam
ear
Sam
burst
into
tears
and
fumbled
with
the
straps
unlading
all
the
pony
packs
and
throwing
them
the
ground
The
others
sorted
out
the
goods
making
pile
all
that
could
left
behind
and
dividing
the
rest
When
this
was
done
they
turned
watch
Gandalf
appeared
have
done
nothing
was
standing
between
the
two
trees
gazing
the
blank
wall
the
cliff
would
bore
hole
into
with
his
eyes
Gimli
was
wandering
about
tapping
the
stone
here
and
there
with
his
axe
Legolas
was
pressed
against
the
rock
listening
Well
here
are
and
all
ready
said
Merry
but
where
are
the
Doors
can
see
any
sign
them
Dwarf
doors
are
not
made
seen
when
shut
said
Gimli
They
are
invisible
and
their
own
makers
cannot
find
them
open
them
their
secret
forgotten
But
this
Door
was
not
made
secret
known
only
Dwarves
said
Gandalf
coming
suddenly
life
and
turning
round
Unless
things
are
altogether
changed
eyes
that
know
what
look
for
may
discover
the
signs
walked
forward
the
wall
Right
between
the
shadow
the
trees
there
was
smooth
space
and
over
this
passed
his
hands
and
fro
muttering
words
under
his
breath
Then
stepped
back
Look
said
Can
you
see
anything
now
The
Moon
now
shone
upon
the
grey
face
the
rock
but
they
could
see
nothing
else
for
while
Then
slowly
the
surface
where
the
wizard
hands
had
passed
faint
lines
appeared
like
slender
veins
silver
running
the
stone
first
they
were
more
than
pale
gossamer

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
sleeps
until
touched
one
who
speaks
words
now
long
forgotten
Middle
earth
long
since
heard
them
and
thought
deeply
before
could
recall
them
mind
What
does
the
writing
say
asked
Frodo
who
was
trying
decipher
the
inscription
the
arch
thought
knew
the
elf
letters
but
cannot
read
these
The
words
are
the
elven
tongue
the
West
Middle
earth
the
Elder
Days
answered
Gandalf
But
they
not
say
anything
importance
They
say
only
The
Doors
Durin
Lord
Moria
Speak
friend
and
enter
And
underneath
small
and
faint
written
Narvi
made
them
Celebrimbor
Hollin
drew
these
signs
What
does
mean
speak
friend
and
enter
asked
Merry
That
plain
enough
said
Gimli
you
are
friend
speak
the
password
and
the
doors
will
open
and
you
can
enter
Yes
said
Gandalf
these
doors
are
probably
governed
words
Some
dwarf
gates
will
open
only
special
times
for
particular
persons
and
some
have
locks
and
keys
that
are
still
needed
when
all
necessary
times
and
words
are
known
These
doors
have
key
the
days
Durin
they
were
not
secret
They
usually
stood
open
and
doorwards
sat
here
But
they
were
shut
any
who
knew
the
opening
word
could
speak
and
pass
least
recorded
not
Gimli
said
the
dwarf
But
what
the
word
was
not
remembered
Narvi
and
his
craft
and
all
his
kindred
have
vanished
from
the
earth
But
not
you
know
the
word
Gandalf
asked
Boromir
surprise
said
the
wizard
The
others
looked
dismayed
only
Aragorn
who
knew
Gandalf
well
remained
silent
and
unmoved
Then
what
was
the
use
bringing
this
accursed
spot
cried
Boromir
glancing
back
with
shudder
the
dark
water
You
told
that
you
had
once
passed
through
the
Mines
How
could
that
you
did
not
know
how
enter
The
answer
your
first
question
Boromir
said
the
wizard
that
not
know
the
word
yet
But
shall
soon
see
And
added
with
glint
his
eyes
under
their
bristling
brows
you
may
ask
what
the
use
deeds
when
they
are
proved
useless
for
your
other
question
you
doubt
tale
have
you
wits
left
did
not
enter
this
way
came
from
the
East
you
wish
know
will
tell
you
that
these
doors
open
outwards
From
the
inside
you
may
thrust
them
open
with
your
hands
From
the
outside
nothing
will
move
them
save
the
spell
command
They
cannot
forced
inwards
What
are
you
going
then
asked
Pippin
undaunted
the
wizard
bristling
brows
JOURNEY
THE
DARK
307
Knock
the
doors
with
your
head
Peregrin
Took
said
Gandalf
But
that
does
not
shatter
them
and
allowed
little
peace
from
foolish
questions
will
seek
for
the
opening
words
once
knew
every
spell
all
the
tongues
Elves
Men
Orcs
that
was
ever
used
for
such
purpose
can
still
remember
ten
score
them
without
searching
mind
But
only
few
trials
think
will
needed
and
shall
not
have
call
Gimli
for
words
the
secret
dwarf
tongue
that
they
teach
none
The
opening
words
were
Elvish
like
the
writing
the
arch
that
seems
certain
stepped
the
rock
again
and
lightly
touched
with
his
staff
the
silver
star
the
middle
beneath
the
sign
the
anvil
Annon
edhellen
edro
ammen
Fennas
nogothrim
lasto
beth
lammen
said
commanding
voice
The
silver
lines
faded
but
the
blank
grey
stone
did
not
stir
Many
times
repeated
these
words
different
order
varied
them
Then
tried
other
spells
one
after
another
speaking
now
faster
and
louder
now
soft
and
slow
Then
spoke
many
single
words
Elvish
speech
Nothing
happened
The
cliff
towered
into
the
night
the
countless
stars
were
kindled
the
wind
blew
cold
and
the
doors
stood
fast
Again
Gandalf
approached
the
wall
and
lifting
his
arms
spoke
tones
command
and
rising
wrath
Edro
edro
cried
and
struck
the
rock
with
his
staff
Open
open
shouted
and
followed
with
the
same
command
every
language
that
had
ever
been
spoken
the
West
Middle
earth
Then
threw
his
staff
the
ground
and
sat
down
silence
that
moment
from
far
off
the
wind
bore
their
listening
ears
the
howling
wolves
Bill
the
pony
started
fear
and
Sam
sprang
his
side
and
whispered
softly
him
not
let
him
run
away
said
Boromir
seems
that
shall
need
him
still
the
wolves
not
find
How
hate
this
foul
pool
stooped
and
picking
large
stone
cast
far
into
the
dark
water
The
stone
vanished
with
soft
slap
but
the
same
instant
there
was
swish
and
bubble
Great
rippling
rings
formed
the
surface
out
beyond
where
the
stone
had
fallen
and
they
moved
slowly
towards
the
foot
the
cliff
Why
did
you
that
Boromir
said
Frodo
hate
this
place
too
and
afraid

what
not

behind

but
something

the

Don

said
Merry
Why
doesn
Gandalf
something
quick
said
Pippin
Gandalf
took
notice
them
sat
with
his
head
bowed
either
despair
anxious
thought
The
mournful
howling
the
wolves
was
heard
again
The
ripples
the
water
grew
and
came
closer
some
were
already
lapping
the
shore
With
suddenness
that
startled
them
all
the
wizard
sprang
his
feet
was
laughing
have
cried
course
course
Absurdly
simple
like
most
riddles
when
you
see
the
answer
Picking
his
staff
stood
before
the
rock
and
said
clear
voice
Mellon
The
star
shone
out
briefly
and
faded
again
Then
silently
great
doorway
was
outlined
though
not
crack
joint
had
been
visible
before
Slowly
divided
the
middle
and
swung
outwards
inch
inch
until
both
doors
lay
back
against
the
wall
Through
the
opening
shadowy
stair
could
seen
climbing
steeply
but
beyond
the
lower
steps
the
darkness
was
deeper
than
the
night
The
Company
stared
wonder
was
wrong
after
all
said
Gandalf
and
Gimli
too
Merry
all
people
was
the
right
track
The
opening
word
was
inscribed
the
archway
all
the
time
The
translation
should
have
been
Say
Friend
and
enter
had
only
speak
the
Elvish
word
for
friend
and
the
doors
opened
Quite
simple
Too
simple
for
learned
lore
master
these
suspicious
days
Those
were
happier
times
Now
let
strode
forward
and
set
his
foot
the
lowest
step
But
that
moment
several
things
happened
Frodo
felt
something
seize
him
the
ankle
and
fell
with
cry
Bill
the
pony
gave
wild
neigh
fear
and
turned
tail
and
dashed
away
along
the
lakeside
into
the
darkness
Sam
leaped
after
him
and
then
hearing
Frodo
cry
ran
back
again
weeping
and
cursing
The
others
swung
round
and
saw
the
waters
the
lake
seething
host
snakes
were
swimming
from
the
southern
end
Out
from
the
water
long
sinuous
tentacle
had
crawled
was
pale
green
and
luminous
and
wet
Its
fingered
end
had
hold
Frodo
foot
and
was
dragging
him
into
the
water
Sam
his
knees
was
now
slashing
with
knife
The
arm
let
Frodo
and
Sam
pulled
him
away
crying
out
for
help
Twenty
other
arms
came
rippling
out
The
dark
water
boiled
and
there
was
hideous
stench
Into
the
gateway
the
stairs
Quick
shouted
Gandalf
leaping
JOURNEY

DARK
309
back
Rousing
them
from
the
horror
that
seemed
have
rooted
all
but
Sam
the
ground
where
they
stood
drove
them
forward
They
were
just
time
Sam
and
Frodo
were
only
few
steps
and
Gandalf
had
just
begun
climb
when
the
groping
tentacles
writhed
across
the
narrow
shore
and
fingered
the
cliff
wall
and
the
doors
One
came
wriggling
over
the
threshold
glistening
the
star
light
Gandalf
turned
and
paused
was
considering
what
word
would
close
the
gate
again
from
within
there
was
need
Many
coiling
arms
seized
the
doors
either
side
and
with
horrible
strength
swung
them
round
With
shattering
echo
they
slammed
and
all
light
was
lost
noise
rending
and
crashing
came
dully
through
the
ponderous
stone
Sam
clinging
Frodo
arm
collapsed
step
the
black
darkness
Poor
old
Bill
said
choking
voice
Poor
old
Bill
Wolves
and
snakes
But
the
snakes
were
too
much
for
him
had
choose
Frodo
had
come
with
you
They
heard
Gandalf
back
down
the
steps
and
thrust
his
staff
against
the
doors
There
was
quiver
the
stone
and
the
stairs
trembled
but
the
doors
did
not
open
Well
well
said
the
wizard
The
passage
blocked
behind
now
and
there
only
one
way
out
the
other
side
the
moun
tains
fear
from
the
sounds
that
boulders
have
been
piled
and
the
trees
uprooted
and
thrown
across
the
gate
sorry
for
the
trees
were
beautiful
and
had
stood
long
felt
that
something
horrible
was
near
from
the
moment
that
foot
first
touched
the
water
said
Frodo
What
was
the
thing
were
there
many
them
not
know
answered
Gandalf
but
the
arms
were
all
guided
one
purpose
Something
has
crept
has
been
driven
out
dark
waters
under
the
mountains
There
are
older
and
fouler
things
than
Orcs
the
deep
places
the
world
did
not
speak
aloud
his
thought
that
whatever
was
that
dwelt
the
lake
had
seized
Frodo
first
among
all
the
Company
Boromir
muttered
under
his
breath
but
the
echoing
stone
magni
fied
the
sound
hoarse
whisper
that
all
could
hear
the
deep
places
the
world
And
thither
are
going
against
wish
Who
will
lead
now
this
deadly
dark
will
said
Gandalf
and
Gimli
shall
walk
with
Follow
staff
the
wizard
passed
ahead
the
great
steps
held
his
staff
aloft
and
from
its
tip
there
came
faint
radiance
The
wide
stairway
was
sound
and
undamaged
Two
hundred
steps
they
counted
broad
310
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
and
shallow
and
the
top
they
found
arched
passage
with
level
floor
leading
into
the
dark
Let
sit
and
rest
and
have
something
eat

the

room
said
Frodo
had
begun
shake
off
the
terror
the
clutching
arm
and
suddenly
felt
extremely
hungry
The
proposal
was
welcomed
all
and
they
sat
down
the
upper
steps
dim
figures
the
gloom
After
they
had
eaten
Gandalf
gave
them
each
third
sip
the
miruvor
Rivendell
will
not
last
much
longer
afraid
said
but
think
need
after
that
horror
the
gate
And
unless
have
great
luck
shall
need
all
that
left
before
see
the
other
side
carefully
with
the
water
too
There
are
many
streams
and
wells
the
Mines
but
they
should
not
touched
may
not
have
chance
filling
our
skins
and
bottles
till
come
down
into
Dimrill
Dale
How
long
that
going
take
asked
Frodo
cannot
say
answered
Gandalf
depends
many
chances
But
going
straight
without
mishap
losing
our
way
shall
take
three
four
marches
expect
cannot
less
than
forty
miles
from
West
door
East
gate
direct
line
and
the
road
may
wind
much
After
only
brief
rest
they
started
their
way
again
All
were
eager
get
the
journey
over
quickly
possible
and
were
willing
tired
they
were
marching
still
for
several
hours
Gandalf
walked
front
before
his
left
hand
held
his
glimmering
staff
the
light
which
just
showed
the
ground
before
his
feet
his
right
held
his
sword
Glamdring
Behind
him
came
Gimli
his
eyes
glinting
the
dim
light
turned
his
head
from
side
side
Behind
the
dwarf
walked
Frodo
and
had
drawn
the
short
sword
Sting
gleam
came
from
the
blades
Sting
Glamdring
and
that
was
some
comfort
for
being
the
work
Elvish
smiths
the
Elder
Days
these
swords
shone
with
cold
light
any
Orcs
were
near
hand
Behind
Frodo
went
Sam
and
after
him
Legolas
and
the
young
hobbits
and
Boromir
the
dark
the
rear
grim
and
silent
walked
Aragorn
The
passage
twisted
round
few
turns
and
then
began
descend
went
steadily
down
for
long
while
before
became
level
once
again
The
air
grew
hot
and
stifling
but
was
not
foul
and
times
they
felt
currents
cooler
air
upon
their
faces
issuing
from
half
guessed
openings
the
walls
There
were
many
these
the
pale
ray
the
wizard
staff
Frodo
caught
glimpses
stairs
and
arches
and
other
passages
and
tunnels
sloping
running
steeply
down
opening
blankly
dark
either
side
was
bewilder
ing
beyond
hope
remembering

311
Gimli
aided
Gandalf
very
little
except
his
stout
courage
least
was
not
were
most
the
others
troubled
the
mere
darkness
itself
Often
the
wizard
consulted
him
points
where
the
choice
way
was
doubtful
but
was
always
Gandalf
who
had
the
final
word
The
Mines
Moria
were
vast
and
intricate
beyond
the
imagination
Gimli
Gloin
son
dwarf
the
mountain
race
though
was
Gandalf
the
far
off
memories
journey
long
before
were
now
little
help
but
even
the
gloom
and
despite
all
windings
the
road
knew
whither
wished
and
did
not
falter
long
there
was
path
that
led
towards
his
goal
not
afraid
said
Aragorn
There
was
pause
longer
than
usual
and
Gandalf
and
Gimli
were
whispering
together
the
others
were
crowded
behind
waiting
anxiously
not
afraid
have
been
with
him
many
journey
never
one
dark
and
there
are
tales
Rivendell
greater
deeds
his
than
any
that
have
seen
will
not
astray
there
any
path
find
has
led
here
against
our
fears
but
will
lead
out
again
whatever
cost
himself
surer
finding
the
way
home
blind
night
than
the
cats
Queen
Bertthiel
was
well
for
the
Company
that
they
had
such
guide
They
had
fuel
nor
any
means
making
torches
the
desperate
scramble
the
doors
many
things
had
been
left
behind
But
without
any
light
they
would
soon
have
come
grief
There
were
not
only
many
roads
choose
from
there
were
also
many
places
holes
and
pitfalls
and
dark
wells
beside
the
path
which
their
passing
feet
echoed
There
were
fissures
and
chasms
the
walls
and
floor
and
every
now
and
then
crack
would
open
right
before
their
feet
The
widest
was
more
than
seven
feet
across
and
was
long
before
Pippin
could
summon
enough
courage
leap
over
the
dreadful
gap
The
noise
churning
water
came
from
far
below
some
great
mill
wheel
was
turning
the
depths
Rope
muttered
Sam
knew
want
hadn
got
these
dangers
became
more
frequent
their
march
became
slower
Already
they
seemed
have
been
tramping
endlessly
the
mountains
roots
They
were
more
than
weary
and
yet
there
seemed
comfort
the
thought
halting
anywhere
Frodo
spirits
had
risen
for
while
after
his
escape
and
after
food
and
draught
the
cordial
but
now
deep
uneasiness
growing
dread
crept
over
him
again
Though
had
been
healed
Rivendell
the
knife
stroke
that
grim
wound
had
not
been
without
effect
His
senses
were
sharper
and
more
aware
things
that
could
not
seen
One
sign
change
that
soon
had
noticed
was
that
could
see
more
312
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
the
dark
than
any
his
companions
save
perhaps
Gandalf
And
was
any
case
the
bearer
the
Ring
hung
upon
its
chain
against
his
breast
and
whiles
seemed
heavy
weight
felt
the
certainty
evil
ahead
and
evil
following
but
said
nothing
gripped
tighter
the
hilt
his
sword
and
went
doggedly
The
Company
behind
him
spoke
seldom
and
then
only
hurried
whispers
There
was
sound
but
the
sound
their
own
feet
the
dull
stump
Gimli
dwarf
boots
the
heavy
tread
Boromir
the
light
step
Legolas
the
soft
scarce
heard
patter
hobbit
feet
and
the
rear
the
slow
firm
footfalls
Aragorn
with
his
long
stride
When
they
halted
for
moment
they
heard
nothing
all
unless
were
occasion
ally
faint
trickle
and
drip
unseen
water
Yet
Frodo
began
hear
imagine
that
heard
something
else
like
the
faint
fall
soft

But

for

was
after
nightfall

Mines
They
had
been
going
for
several
hours
with
only
brief
halts
when
Gandalf
came
his

serious
check
Before
him
stood
wide
dark
arch
opening
into
three
passages
all
led
the
same
general
direction
eastwards
but
the
left
hand
passage
plunged
down
while
the
right
hand
climbed
and
the
middle
way
seemed
run
smooth
and
level
but
very
narrow
have
memory
this
place
all
said
Gandalf
standing
uncertainly
under
the
arch
held
his
staff
the
hope
finding
some
marks

that
might
help
his
choice
but
nothing
the
kind
was
seen
too
weary

said
shaking
his
head
And
expect
that
you
are
all
weary
wearier
had
better
halt
here
for
what
left
the
night
You
know
what
mean
here
ever
dark
but
outside
the
late
Moon
riding
westward
and
the

the

Beyond

they
saw
large
round
hole
like
the
mouth
well
Broken
and
rusty
chains
lay
the
edge
and
trailed
down
into
the
black
pit
Fragments
stone
lay
near
One
you
might
have
fallen
and
still
wondering
when
you
were

the

Aragorn
Merry
Let

This

for

Gimli
That

was

covered
with
stone
lid
But
the
lid
broken
and
must
all
take
care
the
dark
Pippin
felt
curiously
attracted
the
well
While
the
others
were
unrolling
blankets
and
making
beds
against
the
walls
the
chamber
far
possible
from
the
hole
the
floor
crept
the
edge
and
peered
over
chill
air

his
face
rising
from
invisible
depths
Moved
sudden
impulse
groped
for
loose
stone
and
let
drop
felt
his
heart
beat
many
times
before
there
was
any
sound
Then
far
below
the
stone
had
fallen
into
deep
water
some
cavernous
place
there
came
plunk
very
distant
but
magnified
and
repeated
the
hollow
shaft
What
that
cried
Gandalf
was
relieved
when
Pippin
con
fessed
what
had
done
but
was
angry
and
Pippin
could
see
his
eye
glinting
Fool
Took
growled
This

Throw
yourself
next
time
and
then

nuisance
Now
quiet
Nothing
more
was
heard
for
several
minutes
but
then
there
came
out
the
depths
faint
knocks

They
stopped
and
when
the
echoes
had
died
away
they
were
repeated

They
sounded
disquietingly

Gandalf

Let

Pippin
sat
miserably

kept
turning
round
fearing
that
some
unknown

would
crawl
out
the

wished
could
cover
the

only
with

but
dared
not

Actually

was
dark
glimpse
the
old
wizard
huddled
the

shielding
glowing
chip
his
gnarled
hands
between

The
flicker
for

showed
his

nose
and
the

was
Gandalf
who
roused
them
all
from
sleep
had
sat
and
watched
all
alone
for
about
six
hours
and
had
let
the
others
rest
And
the
watches
have
made

again
For
eight
dark
hours
not
counting
two
brief
halts
they
marched
and
they
met
danger
and
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
but
the
faint
gleam
the
wizard
light
bobbing
like
will
the
wisp
front
them
The
passage
they
had
chosen
wound
steadily
upwards
far
they
could
judge
went
great
mounting
curves
and
rose
grew
loftier
and
wider
There
were
now
openings
other
galleries
tunnels
either
side
and
the
floor
was
level
and
sound
without
pits
cracks
Evidently
they
had
struck
what
once
had
been
important
road
and
they
went
forward
quicker
than
they
had
done
their
first
march
this
way
they
advanced
some
fifteen

they
must
have
actually
walked
twenty
miles

Frodo

rose

still
felt
oppressed
and
still
times

beyond

and
patter
their
feet
following
footstep
that
was

They
had
marched
far
the
hobbits
could
endure
without
rest
and
all
were
thinking
place
where
they
could
sleep
when
suddenly
the
walls
right
and
left
vanished
They
seemed
have
passed
through
some
arched
doorway
into
black
and
empty
space
There
was
great
draught
warmer
air
behind
them
and
before
them
the
darkness
was
cold
their
faces
They
halted
and
crowded
anxiously
together

raised
his
staff
and
for
brief
instant
there
was
blaze
like
flash
lightning
Great
shadows
sprang
and
fled
and
for
second
they
saw
vast
roof
far
above
their
heads
upheld
many
mighty
pillars
hewn
stone
Before
them
and
either
side
stretched
huge
empty
hall
its
black
walls
polished
and
smooth
glass
flashed
and
glittered
Three
other
entrances
they
saw
dark
black
arches
one
straight
before
them
eastwards
and
one
either
side
Then
the
light
went
out
That
all
that
shall
venture
for

Gandalf
There

Things
have
gone

the
greater

dark
road
over
But
are
not

long

the

close

escape
the

there
seemed
steady

chill
air
through
the
eastern
archway
All
about
them
they
lay
hung
the
darkness
hollow
and
immense
and
they
were
oppressed
the
loneliness
and
vastness
the
dolven
halls
and
endlessly
branching
stairs
and
passages
The
wildest
imaginings
that
dark
rumour
had
ever
suggested
the
hobbits
fell
altogether
short
the
actual

and
standing

There

Till

wakes
again
from

But
makes
the

thinking
all

still
Gimli
was
silent
Having
sung
his

would
say

Piles
jewels
said
Gandalf
The
Orcs
have
often
plundered
Moria
there
nothing
left
the
upper

And
since
the
dwarves
fled
one
dares
seek
the

down

places
they
are

Then
what
the
dwarves
want
come
back
for
asked
Sam
For
mithril
answered
Gandalf
The
wealth
Moria
was
not
gold
and
jewels
the
toys
the
Dwarves
nor
iron
their
servant
Such
things
they
found
here
true
especially
iron
but
they
did
not
need
delve
for
them
all
things
that
they
desired
they
could
obtain
traffic
For
here
alone
the
world
was
found
Moria
silver
true
silver
some
have
called
mithril
the
Elvish
name
The
Dwarves
have
name
which
they
not
tell
Its
worth
was
ten
times
that
gold
and
now
beyond
price
for
little
left
above
ground
and
even
the
Orcs
dare
not
delve
here
for
The
lodes
lead
away
north
towards
Caradhras
and
down
darkness
The
Dwarves
tell
tale
but
even
muithril
was
the
foundation
their
wealth
also
was
their
destruction
they
delved
too
greedily
and
too
deep
and
disturbed
that
from
which
they
fled
Durin
Bane
what
they
brought
light
the
Orcs
have
gathered
nearly
all
and
given
tribute
Sauron
who
covets
Mithril
All
folk
desired
could
beaten
like
copper
and
polished

and
the

Its
beauty
was
like
that
common
silver
but
the

not

its

everything
Frodo
said
nothing
but
put
his

under

and
touched

his

that

His

All
his

was
given
listening
and
nothing
else
for
two
slow
hours
but
heard
sound
not
even
the
imagined

footfall
His
watch
was
nearly
over
when
far
off
where
guessed
that
the
western
archway
stood
fancied
that
could
see
two
pale
points

almost
like

started
His

When
lay
down
quickly
went

but
seemed
him
that
the
dream
went
heard
whispers
and
saw
the
two
pale
points

approaching
slowly
woke
and
found
that
the
others
were
speaking
softly
near
him
and
that
dim
light
was
falling
his
face
High
above
the
eastern
archway
through
shaft
near
the

came
long
pale
gleam
and
across
the
hall
through
the
northern

light
also
glimmered
faint
and
distantly
Frodo
sat

north
the

and
may
not
easy
find
the
right
road
down
them
The
eastern
arch
will
probably
prove
the
way
that
must
take
but
before
make
our
minds
ought
look
about
Let
towards

the

but
fear
that
the
light
comes
only
down
deep
shafts
Following
his
lead
the
Company
passed
under
the
northern
arch
They
found
themselves
wide
corridor
they
went
along
the
glimmer
grew
stronger
and
they
saw
that
came
through
doorway
their
right
was
high
and
flat
topped
and
the
stone
door
was
still
upon
its
hinges
standing
half
open
Beyond
was
large
square
chamber
was
dimly
lit
but
their
eyes
after
long
time
the
dark
seemed
dazzlingly
bright
and
they
blinked
they
entered
Their
feet
disturbed
deep
dust
upon
the
floor
and
stumbled
among
things
lying
the
doorway
whose
shapes
they
could
not
first
make
out
The
chamber
was
lit
wide
shaft
high
the
further
eastern
wall
slanted
upwards
and
far
above
small
square
patch

sky

the

for
anything

There
was

now
see
that
many
bones
were

and
among
them
were
broken
swords
and

and
cloven

and
helms
Some
the
swords
were

There
were

The

But

This

the

Back
the

Gandalf
had
hardly
spoken
these
words
when
there
came
great
noise
rolling
Boom
that
seemed
come
from
depths
far
below
and
tremble
the
stone
their
feet
They
sprang
towards
the
door
alarm
Doom

rolled
again
huge
hands
were
turning
the
very
caverns
Moria
into
vast
drum
Then
there
came
echoing
blast
great
horn
was
blown
the
hall
and
answering
horns
and
harsh
cries
were
heard
further
off
There
was
hurrying
sound
many
feet
They
are
coming
cried
Legolas
cannot
get
out
said
Gimli
Trapped
cried
Gandalf
Why
did
delay
Here
are
caught
just
they
were
before
But
was
not
here
then
will
see
what
Doom
doom
came
the
drum
beat
and
the
walls
shook
Slam
the
doors
and

them
shouted
Aragorn
And
keep
your
packs
long
you
can
may
get

cut
our
way

said
Gandalf
must
not
get
shut
Keep
the

door
ajar
will
that
way
get
chance
Another
harsh
horn
call
and
shrill
cries
rang
out
Feet
were
coming
down
the
corridor
There
was
ring
and
clatter
the
Company
drew
their
swords
Glamdring
shone
with
pale
light
and
Sting
glinted
the
edges
Boromir
set
his
shoulder
against
the
western
door
Wait

Gandalf
sprang
forward
Boromir

and
drew
himself
his
full
height

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Who
comes
hither
disturb
the
rest
Balin
Lord
Moria
cried
loud
voice
There
was
rush
hoarse
laughter
like
the
fall
sliding
stones
into
pit
amid
the
clamour
deep
voice
was
raised
command
Doom
boom
doom
went
the
drums
the
deep
With
quick
movement
Gandalf
stepped
before
the
narrow
open
ing
the
door
and
thrust
forward
his
staff
There
was
dazzling
flash
that
lit
the
chamber
and
the
passage
outside
For
instant
the
wizard
looked
out
Arrows
whined
and
whistled
down
the
corridor
sprang
back
There
are
Orcs
very
many
them
said
And
some
are
large
and
evil
black
Uruks
Mordor
For
the
moment
they
are
hanging
back
but
there
something
else
there
great
cave
troll
think
more
than
one
There
hope
escape
that
way
And
hope
all
they
come
the
other
door
well
said
Boromir
There
sound
outside
here
yet
said
Aragorn
who
was
stand
ing
the
eastern
door
listening
The
passage
this
side
plunges
straight
down
stair
plainly
does
not
lead
back
towards
the
hall
But
good
flying
blindly
this
way
with
the
pursuit
just
behind
cannot
block
the
door
Its
key
gone
and
the
lock
broken
and
opens
inwards
must
something
delay
the
enemy
first
will
make
them
fear
the
Chamber
Mazarbul
said
grimly
feeling
the
edge
his
sword
Anduril
Heavy
feet
were
heard
the
corridor
Boromir
flung
himself
against
the
door
and
heaved
then
wedged
with
broken
sword
blades
and
splinters
wood
The
Company
retreated
the
other
side
the
chamber
But
they
had
chance
fly
yet
There
was
blow
the
door
that
made
quiver
and
then
began
grind
slowly
open
driving
back
the
wedges
huge
arm
and
shoulder
with
dark
skin
greenish
scales
was
thrust
through
the
widening
gap
Then
great
flat
toeless
foot
was
forced
through
below
There
was
dead
silence
outside
Boromir
leaped
forward
and
hewed
the
arm
with
all
his
might
but
his
sword
rang
glanced
aside
and
fell
from
his
shaken
hand
The
blade
was
notched
Suddenly
and
his
own
surprise
Frodo
felt
hot
wrath
blaze
his
heart
The
Shire
cried
and
springing
beside
Boromir
stooped
and
stabbed
with
Sting
the
hideous
foot
There
was
bellow
and
the
foot
jerked
back
nearly
wrenching
Sting
from
Frodo
arm
Black
drops
dripped
from
the
blade
and
smoked
the
floor
Boromir
hurled
himself
against
the
door
and
slammed
again
THE

One

Aragorn
The

You

Frodo

Drogo
There
was
crash
the
door
followed
crash
after
crash
Rams
and
hammers
were
beating
against
cracked
and
staggered
back
and
the
opening
grew
suddenly
wide
Arrows
came
whistling
but
struck
the
northern
wall
and
fell
harmlessly
the
floor
There
was
horn
blast
and
rush
feet
and
orcs
one
after
another
leaped
into
the
chamber
How
many
there
were
the
Company
could
not
count
The
affray
was
sharp
but
the
orcs
were
dismayed
the
fierceness
the
defence
Legolas
shot
two
through
the
throat
Gimli
hewed
the
legs
from
under
another
that
had
sprung
Balin
tomb
Boromir
and
Aragorn
slew
many
When
thirteen
had
fallen
the
rest
fled
shrieking
leaving
the
defenders
unharmed
except
for
Sam
who
had
scratch
along
the
scalp
quick
duck
had
saved
him
and
had
felled

with
his

Now
the
time
cried
Gandalf
Let
before
the
troll
returns
But
even
they
retreated
and
before
Pippin
and
Merry
had
reached
the
stair
outside
huge
orc
chieftain
almost
man
high
clad
black
mail
from
head
foot
leaped
into
the
chamber
behind
him
his
followers
clustered
the
doorway
His
broad
flat
face
was
swart
his
eyes
were
like
coals
and
his
tongue
was
red
wielded
great
spear
With
thrust
his
huge
hide
shield
turned
Boromir
sword
and
bore
him
backwards
throwing
him
the
ground
Diving
under
Aragorn
blow
with
the
speed
striking
snake
charged
into
the
Company
and
thrust
with
his
spear
straight
Frodo
The
blow
caught
him
the
right
side
and
Frodo
was
hurled
against
the
wall
and
pinned
Sam
with
cry
hacked
the
spear
shaft
and
broke
But
even
the
orc
flung
down
the
truncheon
and
swept
out
his
scimitar
Anduril
came
down
upon
his
helm
There
was
flash
like
flame
and
the
helm
burst
asunder
The
orc
fell
with
cloven
head
His
followers
fled
howling
Boromir
and
Aragorn
sprang
them
Doom
doom
went
the
drums
the
deep
The
great
voice
rolled
out
again
Now
shouted
Gandalf
Now
the
last
chance
Run
for
Aragorn
picked
Frodo
where
lay
the
wall
and
made
for
the
stair
pushing
Merry
and
Pippin
front
him
The
others
followed
but
Gimli
had
dragged
away
Legolas

the
peril
lingered

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
hauled
the
eastern
door
grinding
upon
its
hinges
had
great
iron
rings
either
side
but
could
not
fastened
all
right
gasped
Frodo
can
walk
Put
down
Aragorn
nearly
dropped
him
his
amazement
thought
you
were
dead
cried
Not
yet
said
Gandalf
But
there
time
for
wonder
Off
you
all
you
down
the
stairs
Wait
few
minutes
for
the
bottom
but
not
come
soon
quickly
and
choose
paths
leading
right
and
downwards
cannot
leave
you
hold
the
door
alone
said
Aragorn
say
said
Gandalf
fiercely
Swords
are
more
use
here
The
passage
was
lit
shaft
and
was
utterly
dark
They
groped
their
way
down
long
flight
steps
and
then
looked
back
but
they
could
see
nothing
except
high
above
them
the
faint
glimmer
the
wizard
staff
seemed
still
standing
guard
the
closed
door
Frodo
breathed
heavily
and
leaned
against
Sam
who
put
his
arms
about
him
They
stood
peering
the
stairs
into
the
darkness
Frodo
thought
could
hear
the
voice
Gandalf
above
muttering
words
that
ran
down
the
sloping
roof
with
sighing
echo
could
not
catch
what
was
said
The
walls
seemed
trembling
Every
now
and
again
the
drum
beats
throbbed
and
rolled
doom
doom
Suddenly
the
top
the
stair
there
was
stab
white
light
Then
there
was
dull
rumble
and
heavy
thud
The
drum
beats
broke
out
wildly
doom
boom
doom
boom
and
then
stopped
Gandalf
came
flying
down
the
steps
and
fell
the
ground
the
midst
the
Company
Well
well
That
over
said
the
wizard
struggling
his
feet
have
done
all
that
could
But
have
met
match
and
have
nearly
been
destroyed
But
don
stand
here
You
will
have
without
light
for
while
rather
shaken
Where
are
you
Gimli
Come
ahead
with
Keep
close
behind
all
you
They
stumbled
after
him
wondering
what
had
happened
Doom
doom
went
the
drum
beats
again
they
now
sounded
muffled
and
far
away
but
they
were
following
There
was
other
sound
pursuit
neither
tramp
feet
nor
any
voice
Gandalf
took
turns
right
left
for
the
passage
seemed
going
the
direction
that
desired
Every
now
and
again
descended
flight
steps
fifty
more
lower
level
the
moment
that
was
their
chief
danger
for
the
dark
they
could
not
see
descent
until
they
came
and
put
their
feet
out
into
emptiness
Gandalf
felt
the
ground
with
his
staff
like
blind
man
THE

327
the
end
hour
they
had
gone
mile
maybe
little
more
and
had
descended
many
flights
stairs
There
was
still
sound
pursuit
Almost
they
began
hope
that
they
would
escape
the
bottom
the
seventh
flight
Gandalf
halted
getting
hot
gasped
ought
down
least
the
level
the
Gates
now
Soon
think
should
look
for
left
hand
turn
take
east
hope
not
far
very
weary
must
rest
here
moment
even
all
the
orcs
ever
spawned
are
after
Gimli
took
his
arm
and
helped
him
down
seat
the
step
What
happened
away
there
the
door
asked
Did
you
meet
the
beater
the
drums
not
know
answered
Gandalf
But
found
myself
suddenly
faced
something
that
have
not
met
before
could
think
nothing
but
try
and
put
shutting
spell
the
door
know
many
but
things
that
kind
rightly
requires
time
and
even
then
the
door
can
broken
strength
stood
there
could
hear
orc
voices
the
other
side
any
moment
thought
they
would
burst
open
could
not
hear
what
was
said
they
seemed
talking
their
own
hideous
language
All
caught
was
ghdsh
that
fire
Then
something
came
into
the
chamber
felt
through
the
door
and
the
orcs
themselves
were
afraid
and
fell
silent
laid
hold
the
iron
ring
and
then
perceived
and
spell
What
was
cannot
guess
but
have
never
felt
such
challenge
The
counter
spell
was
terrible
nearly
broke
For
instant
the
door
left
control
and
began
open
had
speak
word
Command
That
proved
too
great
strain
The
door
burst
pieces
Something
dark
cloud
was
blocking
out
all
the
light
inside
and
was
thrown
backwards
down
the
stairs
All
the
wall
gave
way
and
the
roof
the
chamber
well
think
afraid
Balin
buried
deep
and
maybe
something
else
buried
there
too
cannot
say
But
least
the
passage
behind
was
completely
blocked
have
never
felt
spent
but
passing
And
now
what
about
you
Frodo
There
was
not
time
say
but
have
never
been
more
delighted
life
than
when
you
spoke
feared
that
was
brave
but
dead
hobbit
that
Aragorn
was
carrying
What
about
said
Frodo
alive
and
whole
think
bruised
and
pain
but
not
too
bad
Well
said
Aragorn
can
only
say
that
hobbits
are
made
stuff
tough
that
have
never
met
the
like
Had
known
would
have
spoken
softer
the
Inn
Bree
That
spear
thrust
would
have
skewered
wild
boar
Well
did
not
skewer
glad
say
said
Frodo
though
328
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
feel
had
been
caught
between
hammer
and
anvil
said
more
found
breathing
painful
You
take
after
Bilbo
said
Gandalf
There
more
about
you
than
meets
the
eye
said
him
long
ago
Frodo
wondered
the
remark
meant
more
than
said
They
now
went
again
Before
long
Gimli
spoke
had
keen
eyes
the
dark
think
said
that
there
light
ahead
But
not
daylight
red
What
can
GhashP
muttered
Gandalf
wonder
that
what
they
meant
that
the
lower
levels
are
fire
Still
can
only
Soon
the
light
became
unmistakable
and
could
seen
all
was
flickering
and
glowing
the
walls
away
down
the
passage
before
them
They
could
now
see
their
way
front
the
road
sloped
down
swiftly
and
some
way
ahead
there
stood
low
archway
through
the
growing
light
came
The
air
became
very
hot
When
they
came
the
arch
Gandalf
went
through
signing
them
wait
stood
just
beyond
the
opening
they
saw
his
face
lit
red
glow
Quickly
stepped
back
There
some
new
devilry
here
said
devised
for
our
welcome
doubt
But
know
now
where
are
have
reached
the
First
Deep
the
level
immediately
below
the
Gates
This
the
Second
Hall
Old
Moria
and
the
Gates
are
near
away
beyond
the
eastern
end
the
left
not
more
than
quarter
mile
Across
the
Bridge
broad
stair
along
wide
road
through
the
First
Hall
and
out
But
come
and
look
They
peered
out
Before
them
was
another
cavernous
hall
was
loftier
and
far
longer
than
the
one
which
they
had
slept
They
were
near
its
eastern
end
westward
ran
away
into
darkness
Down
the
centre
stalked
double
line
towering
pillars
They
were
carved
like
boles
mighty
trees
whose
boughs
upheld
the
roof
with
branch
ing
tracery
stone
Their
stems
were
smooth
and
black
but
red
glow
was
darkly
mirrored
their
sides
Right
across
the
floor
close
the
feet
two
huge
pillars
great
fissure
had
opened
Out
fierce
red
light
came
and
now
and
again
flames
licked
the
brink
and
curled
about
the
bases
the
columns
Wisps
dark
smoke
wavered
the
hot
air
had
come
the
main
road
down
from
the
upper
halls
should
have
been
trapped
here
said
Gandalf
Let
hope
that
the
fire
now
lies
between
and
pursuit
Come
There
time
lose
Even
spoke
they
heard
again
the
pursuing
drum
beat
Doom
doom
doom
Away
beyond
the
shadows
the
western
end
the
hall
there
came
cries
and
horn
calls
Doom
doom
the
pillars
seemed
tremble
and
the
flames
quiver
THE
BRIDGE
KHAZAD
DUM
329
Now
for
the
last
race
said
Gandalf
the
sun
shining
outside
may
still
escape
After
turned
left
and
sped
across
the
smooth
floor
the
hall
The
distance
was
greater
than
had
looked
they
ran
they
heard
the
beat
and
echo
many
hurrying
feet
behind
shrill
yell
went
they
had
been
seen
There
was
ring
and
clash
steel
arrow
whistled
over
Frodo
head
Boromir
laughed
They
did
not
expect
this
said
The
fire
has
cut
them
off
are
the
wrong
side
Look
ahead
called
Gandalf
The
Bridge
near
dangerous
and
narrow
Suddenly
Frodo
saw
before
him
black
chasm
the
end
the
hall
the
floor
vanished
and
fell
unknown
depth
The
outer
door
could
only
reached
slender
bridge
stone
without
kerb
rail
that
spanned
the
chasm
with
one
curving
spring
fifty
feet
was
ancient
defence
the
Dwarves
against
any
enemy
that
might
capture
the
First
Hall
and
the
outer
passages
They
could
only
pass
across
single
file
the
brink
Gandalf
halted
and
the
others
came
pack
behind
Lead
the
way
Gimli
said
Pippin
and
Merry
next
Straight
and
the
stair
beyond
the
door
Arrows
fell
among
them
One
struck
Frodo
and
sprang
back
Another
pierced
Gandalf
hat
and
stuck
there
like
black
feather
Frodo
looked
behind
Beyond
the
fire
saw
swarming
black
figures
there
seemed
hundreds
orcs
They
brandished
spears
and
scimitars
which
shone
red
blood
the
firelight
Doom
doom
rolled
the
drum
beats
growing
louder
and
louder
doom
doom
Legolas
turned
and
set
arrow
the
string
though
was
long
shot
for
his
small
bow
drew
but
his
hand
fell
and
the
arrow
slipped
the
ground
gave
cry
dismay
and
fear
Two
great
trolls
appeared
they
bore
great
slabs
stone
and
flung
them
down
serve
gangways
over
the
fire
But
was
not
the
trolls
that
had
filled
the
Elf
with
terror
The
ranks
the
orcs
had
opened
and
they
crowded
away
they
themselves
were
afraid
Something
was
coming
behind
them
What
was
could
not
seen
was
like
great
shadow
the
middle
which
was
dark
form
man
shape
maybe
yet
greater
and
power
and
terror
seemed
and
before
came
the
edge
the
fire
and
the
light
faded
cloud
had
bent
over
Then
with
rush
leaped
across
the
fissure
The
flames
roared
greet
and
wreathed
about
and
black
smoke
swirled
the
air
Its
streaming
mane
kindled
and
blazed
behind
its
right
hand
was
blade
like
stabbing
tongue
fire
its
left
held
whip
many
thongs
330
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
wailed
Legolas
Balrog
Balrog
come
Gimli
stared
with
wide
eyes
Durin
Bane
cried
and
letting
his
axe
fall
covered
his
face
Balrog
muttered
Gandalf
Now
understand
faltered
and
leaned
heavily
his
staff
What
evil
fortune
And
already
weary
The
dark
figure
streaming
with
fire
raced
towards
them
The
orcs
yelled
and
poured
over
the
stone
gangways
Then
Boromir
raised
his
horn
and
blew
Loud
the
challenge
rang
and
bellowed
like
the
shout
many
throats
under
the
cavernous
roof
For
moment
the
orcs
quailed
and
the
fiery
shadow
halted
Then
the
echoes
died
sud
denly
flame
blown
out
dark
wind
and
the
enemy
advanced
again
Over
the
bridge
cried
Gandalf
recalling
his
strength
Fly
This
foe
beyond
any
you
must
hold
the
narrow
way
Fly
Aragorn
and
Boromir
did
not
heed
the
command
but
still
held
their
ground
side
side
behind
Gandalf
the
far
end
the
bridge
The
others
halted
just
within
the
doorway
the
hall
end
and
turned
unable
leave
their
leader
face
the
enemy
alone
The
Balrog
reached
the
bridge
Gandalf
stood
the
middle
the
span
leaning
the
staff
his
left
hand
but
his
other
hand
Glamdring
gleamed
cold
and
white
His
enemy
halted
again
facing
him
and
the
shadow
about
reached
out
like
two
vast
wings
raised
the
whip
and
the
thongs
whined
and
cracked
Fire
came
from
its
nostrils
But
Gandalf
stood
firm
You
cannot
pass
said
The
orcs
stood
still
and
dead
silence
fell
servant
the
Secret
Fire
wielder
the
flame
Anor
You
cannot
pass
The
dark
fire
will
not
avail
you
flame
Udtn
back
the
Shadow
You
cannot
pass
The
Balrog
made
answer
The
fire
seemed
die
but
the
darkness
grew
stepped
forward
slowly
the
bridge
and
sud
denly
drew
itself
great
height
and
its
wings
were
spread
from
wall
wall
but
still
Gandalf
could
seen
glimmering
the
gloom
seemed
small
and
altogether
alone
grey
and
bent
like
wizened
tree
before
the
onset
storm
From
out
the
shadow
red
sword
leaped
flaming
Glamdring
glittered
white
answer
There
was
ringing
clash
and
stab
white
fire
The
Balrog
fell
back
and
its
sword
flew
molten
fragments
The
wizard
swayed
the
bridge
stepped
back
pace
and
then
again
stood
still
You
cannot
pass
said
With
bound
the
Balrog
leaped
full
upon
the
bridge
Its
whip
whirled
and
hissed
THE
BRIDGE
KHAZAD
DUM
331
cannot
stand
alone
cried
Aragorn
suddenly
and
ran
back
along
the
bridge
Elendil
shouted
with
you
Gandalf
Gondor
cried
Boromir
and
leaped
after
him
that
moment
Gandalf
lifted
his
staff
and
crying
aloud
smote
the
bridge
before
him
The
staff
broke
asunder
and
fell
from
his
hand
blinding
sheet
white
flame
sprang
The
bridge
cracked
Right
the
Balrog
feet
broke
and
the
stone
upon
which
stood
crashed
into
the
gulf
while
the
rest
remained
poised
quivering
like
tongue
rock
thrust
out
into
emptiness
With
terrible
cry
the
Balrog
fell
forward
and
its
shadow
plunged
down
and
vanished
But
even
fell
swung
its
whip
and
the
thongs
lashed
and
curled
about
the
wizard
knees
dragging
him
the
brink
staggered
and
fell
grasped
vainly
the
stone
and
slid
into
the
abyss
Fly
you
fools
cried
and
was
gone
The
fires
went
out
and
blank
darkness
fell
The
Company
stood
rooted
with
horror
staring
into
the
pit
Even
Aragorn
and
Boromir
came
flying
back
the
rest
the
bridge
cracked
and
fell
With
cry
Aragorn
roused
them
Come
will
lead
you
now
called
must
obey
his
last
command
Follow
They
stumbled
wildly
the
great
stairs
beyond
the
door
Aragorn
leading
Boromir
the
rear
the
top
was
wide
echoing
passage
Along
this
they
fled
Frodo
heard
Sam
his
side
weeping
and
then
found
that
himself
was
weeping
ran
Doom
doom
doom
the
drum
beats
rolled
behind
mournful
now
and
slow
doom
They
ran
The
light
grew
before
them
great
shafts
pierced
the
roof
They
ran
swifter
They
passed
into
hall
bright
with
daylight
from
its
high
windows
the
east
They
fled
across
Through
its
huge
broken
doors
they
passed
and
suddenly
before
them
the
Great
Gates
opened
arch
blazing
light
There
was
guard
orcs
crouching
the
shadows
behind
the
great
door
posts
towering
either
side
but
the
gates
were
shattered
and
cast
down
Aragorn
smote
the
ground
the
captain
that
stood
his
path
and
the
rest
fled
terror
his
wrath
The
Company
swept
past
them
and
took
heed
them
Out
the
Gates
they
ran
and
sprang
down
the
huge
and
age
worn
steps
the
threshold
Moria
Thus
last
they
came
beyond
hope
under
the
sky
and
felt
the
wind
their
faces
They
did
not
halt
until
they
were
out
bowshot
from
the
walls
Dimrill
Dale
lay
about
them
The
shadow
the
Misty
Mountains
lay
upon
but
eastwards
there
was
golden
light
the
land
was
but
one
hour
after
noon
The
sun
was
shining
the
clouds
were
white
and
high
332
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
They
looked
back
Dark
yawned
the
archway
the
Gates
under
the
mountain
shadow
Faint
and
far
beneath
the
earth
rolled
the
slow
drum
beats
doom
thin
black
smoke
trailed
out
Nothing
else
was
seen
the
dale
all
around
was
empty
Doom
Grief
last
wholly
overcame
them
and
they
wept
long
some
standing
and
silent
some
cast
upon
the
ground
Doom
doom
The
drum
beats
faded
Chapter
LOTHLORIEN
Alas
fear
cannot
stay
here
longer
said
Aragorn
looked
towards
the
mountains
and
held
his
sword
Farewell
Gandalf
cried
Did
not
say
you
you
pass
the
doors
Moria
beware
Alas
that
spoke
true
What
hope
have
without
you
turned
the
Company
must
without
hope
said
least
may
yet
avenged
Let
gird
ourselves
and
weep
more
Come
have
long
road
and
much
They
rose
and
looked
about
them
Northward
the
dale
ran
into
glen
shadows
between
two
great
arms
the
mountains
above
which
three
white
peaks
were
shining
Celebdil

flowed
like

over
endless

short
falls
and

about

Yonder
the

said
Aragorn
pointing
the

Down
the
deep
cloven
way
that
climbs
beside
the

should
have
come
fortune
had
been
kinder
Caradhras

said
Gimli
There
stands
smiling
the
sun
shook
his
fist
the
furthest
the
snow
capped
peaks
and
turned
away
the
east
the
outflung
arm
the
mountains
marched
sudden
end
and
far
lands
could
descried
beyond
them
wide
and
vague
the
south
the
Misty
Mountains
receded
endlessly
far
sight
could
reach
Less
than
mile
away
and
little
below
them
for
they
still
stood
high
the
west
side
the
dale
there
lay
mere
was
long
and
oval
shaped
like
great
spear
head
thrust
deep
into
the
northern
glen
but
its
southern
end
was
beyond
the
shadows
under
the
sunlit
sky
Yet
its
waters
were
dark
deep
blue
like
clear
evening
sky
seen
from
lamp
lit
room
Its
face
was
still
and
unruffled
About
lay
smooth
sward
shelving
down
all
sides
its
bare
unbroken
rim
There
lies
the
Mirrormere
deep
Kheled
zaram
said
Gimli
sadly
remember
that
said
May
you
have
joy
the
sight
But
cannot
linger
there
Now
long
shall
journey
ere
have
joy
again
that
must
hasten
away
and
that
must
remain
The
Company
now
went
down
the
road
from
the
Gates
was
rough
and
broken
fading
winding
track
between
heather
and
whin
that
thrust
amid
the
cracking
stones
But
still
could
seen
334
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
that
once
long
ago
great
paved
way
had
wound
upwards
from
the
lowlands
the
Dwarf
kingdom
places
there
were
ruined
works
stone
beside
the
path
and
mounds
green
topped
with
slender
birches
fir
trees
sighing
the
wind
eastward
bend
led
them
hard
the
sward
Mirrormere
and
there
not
far
from
the
roadside
stood
single
column
broken
the
top
That
Durin
Stone
cried
Gimli
cannot
pass
without
turning
aside
for
moment
look
the
wonder
the
dale
swift
then
said
Aragorn
looking
back
towards
the
Gates
The
Sun
sinks
early
The
Orcs
will
not
maybe
come
out
till
after
dusk
but
must
far
away
before
nightfall
The
Moon
almost
spent
and
will
dark
tonight
Come
with
Frodo
cried
the
dwarf
springing
from
the
road
would
not
have
you
without
seeing
Kheled
zaram
ran
down
the
long
green
slope
Frodo
followed
slowly
drawn
the
still
blue
water
spite
hurt
and
weariness
Sam
came
behind
Beside
the
standing
stone
Gimli
halted
and
looked
was
cracked
and
weather
worn
and
the
faint
runes
upon
its
side
could
not
read
This
pillar
marks
the
spot
where
Durin
first
looked
the
Mirrormere
said
the
dwarf
Let
look
ourselves
once
ere
They
stooped
over
the
dark
water
first
they
could
see
nothing
Then
slowly
they
saw
the
forms
the
encircling
mountains
mirrored
profound
blue
and
the
peaks
were
like
plumes
white
flame
above
them
beyond
there
was
space
sky
There
like
jewels
sunk
the
deep
shone
glinting
stars
though
sunlight
was
the
sky
above
their
own
stooping
forms
shadow
could
seen
Kheled
zaram
fair
and
wonderful
said
Gimli
There
lies
the
Crown
Durin
till
wakes
Farewell
bowed
and
turned
away
and
hastened
back
the
greensward
the
road
again
What
did
you
see
said
Pippin
Sam
but
Sam
was
too
deep
thought
answer
The
road
now
turned
south
and
went
quickly
downwards
running
out
from
between
the
arms
the
dale
Some
way
below
the
mere
they
came
deep
well
water
clear
crystal
from
which
freshet
fell
over
stone
lip
and
ran
glistening
and
gurgling
down
steep
rocky
channel
Here
the
spring
from
which
the
Silverlode
rises
said
Gimli
not
drink
icy
cold
Soon
becomes
swift
river
and
gathers
water
from
many
other
mountain
streams
said
Aragorn
Our
road
leads
beside
for
many
miles
For
shall
take
you
the
road
that
Gandalf
chose
and
first
hope
come
the
woods
where
the
Silverlode
flows
into
the
LOTHLORIEN
335
Great
River
out
yonder
They
looked
pointed
and
before
them
they
could
see
the
stream
leaping
down
the
trough
the
valley
and
then
running
and
away
into
the
lower
lands
until
was
lost
golden
haze
There
lie
the
woods
Lothlorien
said
Legolas
That
the
fairest
all
the
dwellings
people
There
are
trees
like
the
trees
that
land
For
the
autumn
their
leaves
fall
not
but
turn
gold
Not
till
the
spring
comes
and
the
new
green
opens
they
fall
and
then
the
boughs
are
laden
with
yellow
flowers
and
the
floor
the
wood
golden
and
golden
the
roof
and
its
pillars
are
silver
for
the
bark
the
trees
smooth
and
grey
still
our
songs
Mirkwood
say
heart
would
glad
were
beneath
the
eaves
that
wood
and
were
springtime
heart
will
glad
even
the
winter
said
Aragorn
But
lies
many
miles
away
Let
hasten
For
some
time
Frodo
and
Sam
managed
keep
with
the
others
but
Aragorn
was
leading
them
great
pace
and
after
while
they
lagged
behind
They
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
early
morning
Sam
cut
was
burning
like
fire
and
his
head
felt
light
spite
the
shining
sun
the
wind
seemed
chill
after
the
warm
darkness
Moria
shivered
Frodo
felt
every
step
more
painful
and
gasped
for
breath
last
Legolas
turned
and
seeing
them
now
far
behind
spoke
Aragorn
The
others
halted
and
Aragorn
ran
back
calling
Boromir
come
with
him
sorry
Frodo
cried
full
concern
much
has
hap
pened
this
day
and
have
such
need
haste
that
have
forgotten
that
you
were
hurt
and
Sam
too
You
should
have
spoken
have
done
nothing
ease
you
ought
though
all
the
orcs
Moria
were
after
Come
now
little
further
there
place
where
can
rest
for
little
There
will
what
can
for
you
Come
Boromir
will
carry
them
Soon
afterwards
they
came
upon
another
stream
that
ran
down
from
the
west
and
joined
its
bubbling
water
with
the
hurrying
Silverlode
Together
they
plunged
over
fall
green
hued
stone
and
foamed
down
into
dell
About
stood
fir
trees
short
and
bent
and
its
sides
were
steep
and
clothed
with
harts
tongue
and
shrubs
whortle
berry
the
bottom
there
was
level
space
through
which
the
stream
flowed
noisily
over
shining
pebbles
Here
they
rested
was
now
nearly
three
hours
after
noon
and
they
had
come
only
few
miles
from
the
Gates
Already
the
sun
was
westering
While
Gimli
and
the
two
younger
hobbits
kindled
fire
brush
and
fir
wood
and
drew
water
Aragorn
tended
Sam
and
Frodo
Sam
336
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
wound
was
not
deep
but
looked
ugly
and
Aragorn
face
was
grave
examined
After
moment
looked
with
relief
Good
luck
Sam
said
Many
have
received
worse
than
this
payment
for
the
slaying
their
first
orc
The
cut
not
poisoned
the
wounds
orc
blades
too
often
are
should
heal
well
when
have
tended
Bathe
when
Gimli
has
heated
water
opened
his
pouch
and
drew
out
some
withered
leaves
They
are
dry
and
some
their
virtue
has
gone
said
but
here
have
still
some
the
leaves
athelas
that
gathered
near
Weathertop
Crush
one
the
water
and
wash
the
wound
clean
and
will
bind
Now
your
turn
Frodo
all
right
said
Frodo
reluctant
have
his
garments
touched
All
needed
was
some
food
and
little
rest
said
Aragorn
must
have
look
and
see
what
the
hammer
and
the
anvil
have
done
you
still
marvel
that
you
are
alive
all
Gently
stripped
off
Frodo
old
jacket
and
worn
tunic
and
gave
gasp
wonder
Then
laughed
The
silver
corslet
shim
mered
before
his
eyes
like
the
light
upon
rippling
sea
Carefully
took
off
and
held
and
the
gems
glittered
like
stars
and
the
sound
the
shaken
rings
was
like
the
tinkle
rain
pool
Look
friends
called
Here
pretty
hobbit
skin
wrap
elven
princeling
were
known
that
hobbits
had
such
hides
all
the
hunters
Middle
earth
would
riding
the
Shire
And
all
the
arrows
all
the
hunters
the
world
would
vain
said
Gimli
gazing
the
mail
wonder
mithril
coat
Mithril
have
never
seen
heard
tell
one
fair
this
the
coat
that
Gandalf
spoke
Then
undervalued
But
was
well
given
have
often
wondered
what
you
and
Bilbo
were
doing
close
his
little
room
said
Merry
Bless
the
old
hobbit
love
him
more
than
ever
hope
get
chance
telling
him
about
There
was
dark
and
blackened
bruise
Frodo
right
side
and
breast
Under
the
mail
there
was
shirt
soft
leather
but
one
point
the
rings
had
been
driven
through
into
the
flesh
Frodo
left
side
also
was
scored
and
bruised
where
had
been
hurled
against
the
wall
While
the
others
set
the
food
ready
Aragorn
bathed
the
hurts
with
water
which
athelas
was
steeped
The
pungent
fragrance
filled
the
dell
and
all
those
who
stooped
over
the
steaming
water
felt
refreshed
and
strengthened
Soon
Frodo
felt
the
pain
leave
him
and
his
breath
grew
easy
though
was
stiff
and
sore
the
touch
for
many
days
Aragorn
bound
some
soft
pads
cloth
his
side
The
mail
marvellously
light
said
Put
again
you
can
bear
heart
glad
know
that
you
have
such
coat
LOTHLORIEN
337
not
lay
aside
even
sleep
unless
fortune
brings
you
where
you
are
safe
for
while
and
that
will
seldom
chance
while
your
quest
lasts
When
they
had
eaten
the
Company
got
ready
They
put
out
the
fire
and
hid
all
traces
Then
climbing
out
the
dell
they
took
the
road
again
They
had
not
gone
far
before
the
sun
sank
behind
the
westward
heights
and
great
shadows
crept
down
the
mountain
sides
Dusk
veiled
their
feet
and
mist
rose
the
hollows
Away
the
east
the
evening
light
lay
pale
upon
the
dim
lands
distant
plain
and
wood
Sam
and
Frodo
now
feeling
eased
and
greatly
refreshed
were
able
fair
pace
and
with
only
one
brief
halt
Aragorn
led
the
Company
for
nearly
three
more
hours
was
dark
Deep
night
had
fallen
There
were
many
clear
stars
but
the
fast
waning
moon
would
not
seen
till
late
Gimli
and
Frodo
were
the
rear
walking
softly
and
not
speaking
listening
for
any
sound
upon
the
road
behind
length
Gimli
broke
the
silence
Not
sound
but
the
wind
said
There
are
goblins
near
ears
are
made
wood
hoped
that
the
Orcs
will
content
with
driving
from
Moria
And
maybe
that
was
all
their
purpose
and
they
had
nothing
else
with
with
the
Ring
Though
Orcs
will
often
pursue
foes
for
many
leagues
into
the
plain
they
have
fallen
captain
avenge
Frodo
did
not
answer
looked
Sting
and
the
blade
was
dull
Yet
had
heard
something
thought
had
soon
the
shadows
had
fallen
about
them
and
the
road
behind
was
dim
had
heard
again
the
quick
patter
feet
Even
now
heard
turned
swiftly
There
were
two
tiny
gleams
light
behind
for
moment
thought
saw
them
but
once
they
slipped
aside
and
vanished
What
said
the
dwarf
don
know
answered
Frodo
thought
heard
feet
and
thought
saw
light
like
eyes
have
thought
often
since
first
entered
Moria
Gimli
halted
and
stooped
the
ground
hear
nothing
but
the
night
speech
plant
and
stone
said
Come
Let
hurry
The
others
are
out
sight
The
night
wind
blew
chill
the
valley
meet
them
Before
them
wide
grey
shadow
loomed
and
they
heard
endless
rustle
leaves
like
poplars
the
breeze
Lothlorien
cried
Legolas
Lothlorien
have
come
the
eaves
the
Golden
Wood
Alas
that
winter
Under
the
night
the
trees
stood
tall
before
them
arched
over
the
road
and
stream
that
ran
suddenly
beneath
their
spreading
boughs
338
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
the
dim
light
the
stars
their
stems
were
grey
and
their
quivering
leaves
hint
fallow
gold
Lothlorien
said
Aragorn
Glad
hear
again
the
wind
the
trees
are
still
little
more
than
five
leagues
from
the
Gates
but
can
further
Here
let
hope
that
the
virtue
the
Elves
will
keep
tonight
from
the
peril
that
comes
behind
Elves
indeed
still
dwell
here
the
darkening
world
said
Gimli
long
since
any
own
folk
journeyed
hither
back
the
land
whence
wandered
ages
long
ago
said
Legolas
but
hear
that
Lorien
not
yet
deserted
for
there
secret
power
here
that
holds
evil
from
the
land
Nevertheless
its
folk
are
seldom
seen
and
maybe
they
dwell
now
deep
the
woods
and
far
from
the
northern
border
Indeed
deep
the
wood
they
dwell
said
Aragorn
and
sighed
some
memory
stirred
him
must
fend
for
ourselves
tonight
will
forward
short
way
until
the
trees
are
all
about
and
then
will
turn
aside
from
the
path
and
seek
place
rest
stepped
forward
but
Boromir
stood
irresolute
and
did
not
follow
there
other
way
said
What
other
fairer
way
would
you
desire
said
Aragorn
plain
road
though
led
through
hedge
swords
said
Boromir
strange
paths
has
this
Company
been
led
and
far
evil
fortune
Against
will
passed
under
the
shades
Moria
our
loss
And
now
must
enter
the
Golden
Wood
you
say
But
that
perilous
land
have
heard
Gondor
and
said
that
few
come
out
who
once
and
that
few
none
have
escaped
unscathed
Say
not
unscathed
but
you
say
unchanged
then
maybe
you
will
speak
the
truth
said
Aragorn
But
lore
wanes
Gondor
Boromir
the
city
those
who
once
were
wise
they
now
speak
evil
Lothlorien
Believe
what
you
will
there
other
way
for
unless
you
would
back
Moria
gate
scale
the
pathless
mountains
swim
the
Great
River
all
alone
Then
lead
said
Boromir
But
perilous
Perilous
indeed
said
Aragorn
fair
and
perilous
but
only
evil
need
fear
those
who
bring
some
evil
with
them
Follow
They
had
gone
little
more
than
mile
into
the
forest
when
they
came
upon
another
stream
flowing
down
swiftly
from
the
tree
clad
slopes
that
climbed
back
westward
towards
the
mountains
They
heard
splashing
over
fall
away
among
the
shadows
their
right
Its
dark
hurrying
waters
ran
across
the
path
before
them
and
joined
the
Silverlode
swirl
dim
pools
among
the
roots
trees
Here
Nimrodel
said
Legolas
this
stream
the
Silvan
Elves
LOTHLORIEN
339
made
many
songs
long
ago
and
still
sing
them
the
North
remembering
the
rainbow
its
falls
and
the
golden
flowers
that
floated
its
foam
All
dark
now
and
the
Bridge
Nimrodel
broken
down
will
bathe
feet
for
said
that
the
water
healing
the
weary
went
forward
and
climbed
down
the
deep
cloven
bank
and
stepped
into
the
stream
Follow
cried
The
water
not
deep
Let
wade
across
the
further
bank
can
rest
and
the
sound
the
falling
water
may
bring
sleep
and
forgetfulness
grief
One
one
they
climbed
down
and
followed
Legolas
For
moment
Frodo
stood
near
the
brink
and
let
the
water
flow
over
his
tired
feet
was
cold
but
its
touch
was
clean
and
went
and
mounted
his
knees
felt
that
the
stain
travel
and
all
weariness
was
washed
from
his
limbs
When
all
the
Company
had
crossed
they
sat
and
rested
and
ate
little
food
and
Legolas
told
them
tales
Lothldorien
that
the
Elves
Mirkwood
still
kept
their
hearts
sunlight
and
starlight
upon
the
meadows
the
Great
River
before
the
world
was
grey
length
silence
fell
and
they
heard
the
music
the
waterfall
running
sweetly
the
shadows
Almost
Frodo
fancied
that
could
hear
voice
singing
mingled
with
the
sound
the
water
you
hear
the
voice
Nimrodel
asked
Legolas
will
sing
you
song
the
maiden
Nimrodel
who
bore
the
same
name
the
stream
beside
which
she
lived
long
ago
fair
song
our
wood
land
tongue
but
this
how
runs
the
Westron
Speech
some
Rivendell
now
sing
soft
voice
hardly
heard
amid
the
rustle
the
leaves
above
them
began
Elven
maid
there
was
old
shining
star
day
Her
mantle
white
was
hemmed
with
gold
Her
shoes
silver
grey
star
was
bound
upon
her
brows
light
was
her
hair
sun
upon
the
golden
boughs
Lorien
the
fair
Her
hair
was
long
her
limbs
were
white
And
fair
she
was
and
free
And
the
wind
she
went
light

linden
tree
340
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Beside
the
falls
Nimrodel
water
clear
and
cool
Her
voice
falling
silver
fell
Into
the
shining
pool
Where
now
she
wanders
none
can
tell
sunlight
shade
For
lost
yore
was
Nimrodel
And
the
mountains
strayed
The
elven
ship
haven
grey
Beneath
the
mountain
lee
Awaited
her
for
many
day
Beside
the
roaring
sea
wind
night
Northern
lands
Arose
and
loud
cried
And
drove
the
ship
from
elven
strands
Across
the
streaming
tide
When
dawn
came
dim
the
land
was
lost
The
mountains
sinking
grey
Beyond
the
heaving
waves
that
tossed
Their
plumes
blinding
spray
Amroth
beheld
the
fading
shore
Now
low
beyond
the
swell
And
cursed
the
faithless

that
bore
Him

When
golden

From

sea
they
saw
him
leap
arrow
from
the
string
And
dive
into
the
water
deep
mew
upon
the
wing
The
wind
was
his
flowing
hair
The
foam
about
him
shone
Afar
they
saw
him
strong
and
fair
riding
like
swan
LOTHLORIEN
341
But
from
the
West
has
come
word
And
the
Hither
Shore
tidings
Elven
folk
have
heard
Amroth
evermore
The
voice
Legolas
faltered
and
the
song
ceased
cannot
sing
any
more
said
That
but
part
for
have
forgotten
much
long
and
sad
for
tells
how
sorrow
came
upon
Lothlorien
Lorien
the
Blossom
when
the
Dwarves
awakened
evil
the
mountains
But
the
Dwarves
did
not
make
the
evil
said
Gimli
said
not
yet
evil
came
answered
Legolas
sadly
Then
many
the
Elves
Nimrodel
kindred
left
their
dwellings
and
departed
and
she
was
lost
far
the
South
the
passes
the
White
Moun
tains
and
she
came
not
the
ship
where
Amroth
her
lover
waited
for
her
But
the
spring
when
the
wind
the
new
leaves
the
echo
her
voice
may
still
heard
the
falls
that
bear
her
name
And
when
the
wind
the
South
the
voice
Amroth
comes
from
the
sea
for
Nimrodel
flows
into
Silverlode
that
Elves
call
Celebrant
and
Celebrant
into
Anduin
the
Great
and
Anduin
flows
into
the
Bay
Belfalas
whence
the
Elves
Lorien
set
sail
But
neither
Nimrodel
nor
Amroth
came
ever
back
told
that
she
had
house
built
the
branches
tree
that
grew
near
the
falls
for
that
was
the
custom
the
Elves
Lorien
dwell
the
trees
and
maybe
still
Therefore
they
were
called
the
Galadhrim
the
Tree
people
Deep
their
forest
the
trees
are
very
great
The
people
the
woods
did
not
delve
the
ground
like
Dwarves
nor
build
strong
places
stone
before
the
Shadow
came
And
even
these
latter
days
dwelling
the
trees
might
thought
safer
than
sitting
the
ground
said
Gimli
looked
across
the
stream
the
road
that
led
back
Dimrill
Dale
and
then
into
the
roof
dark
boughs
above
Your
words
bring
good
counsel
Gimli
said
Aragorn
cannot
build
house
but
tonight
will
the
Galadhrim
and
seek
refuge
the
tree
tops
can
have
sat
here
beside
the
road
already
longer
than
was
wise
The
Company
now
turned
aside
from
the
path
and
went
into
the
shadow
the
deeper
woods
westward
along
the
mountain
stream
away
from
Silverlode
Not
far
from
the
falls
Nimrodel
they
found
cluster
trees
some
which
overhung
the
stream
Their
great
grey
trunks
were
mighty
girth
but
their
height
could
not
guessed
will
climb
said
Legolas
home
among
trees
root
bough
though
these
trees
are
kind
strange
save

name

Mellyrn
they
are
called
and
are
those
that
bear
the

but

see
now
what
their

and

Whatever
may
said
Pippin
they
will
marvellous

indeed
they
can
offer
any

except

Then
dig

the

said
Legolas
that

after
the
fashion

But
you
must
dig

and
deep

wish
hide
from
Orcs
sprang
lightly
from
the
ground
and
caught
branch
that
grew
from
the
trunk
high
above
his
head
But
even
swung
there
for
moment
voice
spoke
suddenly
from
the
tree
shadows
above
him
Daro
said
commanding
tone
and
Legolas
dropped
back
earth
surprise
and
fear
shrank
against
the
bole
the
tree
Stand
still
whispered
the
others
not
move
speak
There
was
sound
soft
laughter
over
their
heads
and
then
another
clear
voice
spoke
elven
tongue
Frodo
could
understand
little
what
was
said
for
the
speech
that
the
Silvan
folk
east
the
mountains
used
among
themselves
was
unlike
that
the
West
Legolas
looked
and
answered
the
same
language
Who
are
they
and
what
they
say
asked
Merry
They
Elves
said
Sam
Can
you
hear
their
voices
Yes
they
are
Elves
said
Legolas
and
they
say
that
you
breathe
loud
that
they
could
shoot
you
the
dark
Sam
hastily
put
his
hand
over
his
mouth
But
they
say
also
that
you
need
have
fear
They
have
been
aware
for
long
while
They
heard
voice
across
the
Nimrodel
and
knew
that
was
one
their
Northern
kindred
and
therefore
they
did
not
hinder
our
crossing
and
after
wards
they
heard
song
Now
they
bid
climb
with
Frodo
for
they
seem
have
had
some
tidings
him
and
our
journey
The
others
they
ask
wait
little
and
keep
watch
the
foot
the
tree
until
they
have
decided
what
done
Out
the
shadows
ladder
was
let
down
was
made
rope
silver
grey
and
glimmering
the
dark
and
though
looked
slender
proved
strong
enough
bear
many
men
Legolas
ran
lightly
and
Frodo
followed
slowly
behind
came
Sam
trying
not
breathe
loudly
The
branches
the
mallorn
tree
grew
out
nearly
straight
from
the
trunk
and
then
swept
upward
but
near
the
top
the
main
stem
divided
into
crown
many
boughs
and
among
these
they
found
that
there
had
been
built
wooden
platform
flet
such
things
were
called
those
days
the
Elves
called

reached
round
hole
the
centre
through
which
the
ladder
passed
When
Frodo
came
last
the
flet
found
Legolas
seated
with
three
other
Elves
They
were
clad
shadowy
grey
and
could
not
seen
among
the
tree
stems
unless
they
moved
suddenly
They
stood
and
one
them
uncovered
small
lamp
that
gave
out
slender
silver
beam
held
looking
Frodo
face
and
Sam
Then
shut
off
the
light
again
and
spoke
words
welcome
his
elven
tongue
Frodo
spoke
haltingly
return
Welcome
the
Elf
then
said
again
the
Common

Even
our

North

sundered
from
But
there
are
some
still
who
abroad
for
the
gathering
news
and
the
watching
our
enemies
and
they

one
Haldir

Rumil

But
have
heard
rumours
your
coming
for
the

Elrond
passed
Lorien
their
way
home
the
Dimrill
Stair
had
not

halflings
for
many
long
year
and
did
not

that
any

Middle
earth
You
not
look
evil
And
since
you
come
with
Elf
our
kindred
are
willing
befriend
you
Elrond
asked
though
not
our
custom
lead
strangers
through
our
land
But
you
must
stay
here
tonight
How
many
are
you
Eight

Legolas

All

But

Haldir
That

They

Elrond

Frodo
Elrond
himself
chose
him
one
our
companions
and
has
been
brave
and
faithful
The
Elves
spoke
together
soft
voices
and
questioned
Legolas
their
own
tongue
Very
good
said
Haldir
last
will
this
though
against
our
liking
Aragorn
and
Legolas
will
guard
him
and
answer
for
him
shall
pass
but
must
blindfold
through
Lothlorien
But
now
must
debate
longer
Your

must
not

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
saw
great
troop
Orcs
going
north
towards
Moria
along
the
skirts
the
mountains
many
days
ago
Wolves
are
howling
the
wood
borders
you
have
indeed
come
from
Moria
the
peril
cannot
far
behind
Tomorrow
early
you
must
The
four
hobbits
shall
climb
here
and
stay
with
not
fear
them
There
another
talan
the
next
tree
There
the
others
must
take
refuge
You
Legolas
must
answer
for
them
Call
anything
amiss
And
have
eye
that
dwarf
Legolas
once
went
down
the
ladder
take
Haldir
message
and
soon
afterwards
Merry
and
Pippin
clambered
the
high
flet
They
were
out
breath
and
seemed
rather
scared
There
said
Merry
panting
have
lugged
your
blankets
well
our
own
Strider
has
hidden
all

You

Haldir

you
that

and
have

and
cloaks

The
hobbits
accepted
this
second
and
far
better
supper
very
gladly
Then
they
wrapped
themselves
warmly
not
only
the
fur
cloaks
the
Elves
but
their
own
blankets
well
and
tried
sleep
But
weary
they
were
only
Sam
found
that
easy
Hobbits
not
like
heights
and
not
sleep
upstairs
even
when
they
have
any
stairs
The
flet
was
not
all
their
liking
bedroom
had
walls
not
even

only
one
side
was
there
light
plaited

could

and

Pippin
went
talking

Once

Sam

And
the

said
the
sooner
drop
off
you
take
meaning
Frodo
lay
for
some
time
awake
and
looked
the
stars
glinting
through
the
pale
roof
quivering
leaves
Sam
was
snoring
his
side
long
before
himself
closed
his
eyes
could
dimly
see
the
grey
forms
two
elves
sitting
motionless
with
their
arms
about
their
knees
speaking
whispers
The
other
had
gone
down
take
his
watch
one
the
lower
branches
last
lulled
the
wind
the
boughs
above
and
the
sweet
murmur
the
falls
Nimrodel
below
Frodo
fell
asleep
with
the
song
Legolas
running
his
mind
Late
the
night
woke
The
other
hobbits
were
asleep
The
Elves
were
gone
The
sickle
Moon
was
gleaming
dimly
among
the
LOTHLORIEN
345
leaves
The
wind
was
still
little
way
off
heard
harsh
laugh
and
the
tread
many
feet
the
ground
below
There
was
ring
metal
The
sounds
died
slowly
away
and
seemed
southward
into
the
wood
head
appeared
suddenly
through
the
hole
the
flet
Frodo
sat
alarm
and
saw
that
was
grey
hooded
Elf
looked
towards
the
hobbits
What
said
Frodo
Yrch
said
the
Elf
hissing
whisper
and
cast
the
flet
the
rope
ladder
rolled
Orcs
said
Frodo
What
are
they
doing
But
the
Elf
had
gone
There
were
more
sounds
Even
the
leaves
were
silent
and
the
very
falls
seemed
hushed
Frodo
sat
and
shivered
his
wraps
was
thankful
that
they
had
not
been
caught
the
ground
but
felt
that
the
trees
offered
little
protection
except
concealment
Orcs
were
keen
hounds
scent
was
said
but
they
could
also
climb
drew
out
Sting
flashed
and
glittered
like
blue
flame
and
then
slowly
faded
again
and
grew
dull
spite
the
fading
his
sword
the
feeling
immediate
danger
did
not
leave
Frodo
rather
grew
stronger
got
and
crawled
the
opening
and
peered
down
was
almost
certain
that
could
hear
stealthy
movements
the
tree
foot
far
below
Not
Elves
for
the
woodland
folk
were
altogether
noiseless
their
movements
Then
heard
faintly
sound
like
sniffing
and
some
thing
seemed
scrabbling
the
bark
the
tree
trunk
stared
down
into
the
dark
holding
his
breath
Something
was
now
climbing
slowly
and
its
breath
came
like
soft
hissing
through
closed
teeth
Then
coming
close
the
stem
Frodo
saw
two
pale
eyes
They
stopped
and
gazed
upward
unwinking
Suddenly
they
turned
away
and
shadowy
figure
slipped
round
the
trunk
the
tree
and
vanished
Immediately
afterwards
Haldir
came
climbing
swiftly
through
the
branches
There
was
something
this
tree
that
have
never
seen
before
said
was
not
orc
fled
soon
touched
the
tree
stem
seemed
wary
and
have
some
skill
trees
might
have
thought
that
was
one
you
hobbits
did
not
shoot
for
dared
not
arouse
any
cries
cannot
risk
battle
strong
company
Orcs
has
passed
They
crossed
the
Nimrodel
curse
their
foul
feet
its
clean
water
and
went
down
the
old
road
beside
the
river
They
seemed
pick
some
scent
and
they
searched
the
ground
for
while
near
the
place
where
you
halted
The
three
could
not
challenge
hundred
went
ahead
and
spoke
with
feigned
voices
leading
them
into
the
wood
346
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Orophin
has
now
gone
haste
back
our
dwellings
warn
our
people
None
the
Orcs
will
ever
return
out
Lorien
And
there
will
many
Elves
hidden
the
northern
border
before
another
night
falls
But
you
must
take
the
road
south
soon
fully
light
Day
came
pale
from
the
East
the
light
grew
filtered
through
the
yellow
leaves
the
mallorn
and
seemed
the
hobbits
that
the
early
sun
cool
summer
morning
was
shining
Pale
blue
sky
peeped
among
the
moving
branches
Looking
through
opening
the
south
side
the
flet
Frodo
saw
all
the
valley
the
Silverlode
lying
like
sea
fallow
gold
tossing
gently
the
breeze
The
morning
was
still
young
and
cold
when
the
Company
set
out
again
guided
now
Haldir
and
his
brother
Rumil
Farewell
sweet
Nimrodel
cried
Legolas
Frodo
looked
back
and
caught
gleam
white
foam
among
the
grey
tree
stems
Farewell
said
seemed
him
that
would
never
hear
again
running
water
beautiful
for
ever
blending
its
innumerable
notes
endless
changeful
music
They
went
back
the
path
that
still
went
along
the
west
side
the
Silverlode
and
for
some
way
they
followed
southward
There
were
the
prints
orc
feet
the
earth
But
soon
Haldir
turned
aside
into
the
trees
and
halted
the
bank
the
river
under
their
shadows
There
one
people
yonder
across
the
stream
said
though
you
may
not
see
him
gave
call
like
the
low
whistle
bird
and
out
thicket
young
trees
Elf
stepped
clad
grey
but
with
his
hood
thrown
back
his
hair
glinted
like
gold
the
morning
sun
Haldir
skilfully
cast
over
the
stream
coil
grey
rope
and
caught
and
bound
the
end
about
tree
near
the
bank
Celebrant
already

stream
here
you
see
said
Haldir
and
runs
both
swift
and
deep
and
very
cold
not
set
foot
far
north
unless
must
But
these
days
watchfulness
not
make
bridges
This
how
cross
Follow
made
his
end
the
rope
fast
about
another
tree
and
then
ran
lightly
along
over
the
river
and
back
again
were
road
can
walk
this
path
said
Legolas
but
the
others
have
not
this
skill
Must
they
swim
said
Haldir
have
two
more
ropes
will
fasten
them
above
the
other
one
shoulder
high
and
another
half
high
and
hold
ing
these
the
strangers
should
able
cross
with
care
When
this
slender
bridge
had
been
made
the
Company
passed
over
some
cautiously
and
slowly
others
more
easily
the
hobbits
Pippin
proved
the
best
for
was
sure
footed
and
walked
over
quickly
holding
only
with
one
hand
but
kept
his
eyes
the
bank
ahead
and
did
not
look
down
Sam
shuffled
along

hard
and
looking
down
into
the
pale
eddying
water
was
chasm
the
mountains
breathed
with
relief
when
was
safely
across
Live
and
learn
gaffer
used
say
Though
was
thinking
gardening
not
roosting
like
bird
nor
trying
walk
like
spider
Not
even
uncle
Andy
ever
did
trick
like
that
When
length
all
the
Company
was
gathered
the
east
bank
the
Silverlode
the
Elves
untied
the
ropes
and
coiled
two
them
Rumil
who
had
remained
the
other
side
drew
back
the
last
one
slung
his
shoulder
and
with
wave
his
hand
went
away
back
Nimrodel
keep
watch
Now
friends
said
Haldir
you
have
entered
the
Naith
Lorien
the
Gore
you
would
say
for
the
land
that
lies
like
spearhead
between
the
arms
Silverlode
and
Anduin
the
Great
allow
strangers

out
the
secrets
the
Naith
Few
indeed
are
permitted
even
set
foot
there
was
agreed
shall
here
blindfold
the
eyes
Gimli
the
Dwarf
The
others
may
walk
free
for
while
until
come
nearer
our
dwellings
down
Egladil
the
Angle
between
the
waters
This
was
not
all
the
liking
Gimli
The
agreement
was
made
without
consent
said
will
not
walk
blindfold
like
beggar
prisoner
And
spy
folk
have
never
had
dealings
with
any
the
servants
the
Enemy
Neither
have
done
harm
the
Elves
more
likely
betray
you
than
Legolas
any
other
companions
not
doubt
you
said
Haldir
Yet
this
our
law
not
the
master
the
law
and
cannot
set
aside
have
done
much
letting
you
set
foot
over
Celebrant
Gimli
was
obstinate
planted
his
feet
firmly
apart
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
haft
his
axe
will
forward
free
said
will
back
and
seek
own
land
where
known
true
word
though
perish
alone
the
wilderness
You
cannot
back
said
Haldir
sternly
Now
you
have
come
thus
far
you
must
brought
before
the
Lord
and
the
Lady
They
shall
judge
you
hold
you
give
you
leave
they
will
You
cannot
cross
the
rivers
again
and
behind
you
there
are
now
secret
sentinels
that
you
cannot
pass
You
would
slain
before
you
saw
them
Gimli
drew
his
axe
from
his
belt
Haldir
and
his
companion
bent
their
bows
plague
Dwarves
and
their
stiff
necks
said
Legolas
Come
said
Aragorn
still
lead
this
Company
you
must
bid
hard
upon
the
Dwarf
thus
singled
out
will
all
blindfold
even
Legolas
That
will
best

will
make
the

slow
and
dull
348
THE

Gimli
laughed
suddenly

Will
Haldir
lead
all
string
like
many
blind
beggars
with

dog
But
will
content
only
Legolas
here
shares
blindness
Elf
and

here
said
Legolas
becoming
angry
his
turn
Now
let
cry
plague
the
stiff
necks
Elves
said
Aragorn
But
the
Company
shall
all
fare
alike
Come
bind
our

Haldir
shall
claim
full
amends
for
every
fall
and
stubbed
toe
you
not

said
Gimli
they
bound
cloth
about
his
eyes
You
will
have

said
Haldir
shall
lead
you
well
and
the
paths
are
smooth
and
straight
Alas
for
the
folly
these
days
said
Legolas
Here
all
are
enemies
the
one
Enemy
and
yet
must
walk
blind
while
the
sun

the
woodland
under

Folly
may
seem
said
Haldir
Indeed
nothing
the
power
the
Dark
Lord
more
clearly
shown
than
the
estrangement
that
divides
all
those
who
still
oppose
him
Yet
little
faith
and
trust
find
now
the
world
beyond
Lothlorien
unless
maybe
Riven

dare
not
our
own
trust
endanger
our
land
live
now
upon
island
amid
many
perils
and
our

often
upon
the

than
upon
the

The

defended
but
they
are
sure
guard
more
for
the
Shadow
has
crept
northward
all
about
Some
speak
departing
yet
for
that
already
seems
too
late
The
mountains
the
west
are
growing
evil
the
east
the
lands
are
waste
and
full
Sauron
creatures
and
rumoured
that
cannot
now
safely
pass
southward
through
Rohan
and
the
mouths
the
Great
River
are
watched
the
Enemy
Even
could
come
the

any

said
that
there
are
still

the
High
Elves
but
they
are
far
north
and

beyond

the
Halflings
But
where
that

You

Happy

Tell

Merry

Some

Yet
not

that

For

the
Company
filed
slowly
along
the
paths
the
wood
led
Haldir
while
the
other
Elf
walked
behind
They
felt
the
ground
beneath
their
feet
smooth
and
soft
and
after
while
they
walked
more
freely
without
fear

Being
deprived

Frodo
found
his
hearing
and
other
senses
sharpened
could
smell
the
trees
and
the
trodden
grass
could
hear
many
different
notes

set

upon
the
far
bank

strange
feeling
had
come
upon
him
and
deepened
walked
into

him
that
had
stepped
over

into

the

and
was

Rivendell
there
was

ancient

the
ancient

still
lived
the

Evil
had
been

sorrow

the
Elves
feared

distrusted
the

outside
wolves
were
howling

lay
All
that
day
the
Company
marched
until
they
felt
the
cool
evening
come
and
heard
the
early
night
wind
whispering
among
many
leaves
Then
they
rested
and
slept
without
fear
upon
the
ground
for
their
guides
would
not
permit
them
unbind
their
eyes
and
they
could
not
climb
the
morning
they
went
again
walking
without
haste
noon
they
halted
and
Frodo
was
aware
that
they
had
passed
out
under
the
shining
Sun
Suddenly
heard
the
sound
many
voices
all
around
him
marching
host
Elves
had
come
silently
they
were
hastening
towards
the
northern
borders
guard
against
any
attack
from
Moria
and
they
brought
news
some
which
Haldir
reported
The
maraud
ing
orcs
had
been
waylaid
and
almost
all
destroyed
the
remnant
had
fled
westward
towards
the
mountains
and
were
being
pursued

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
strange
creature
also
had
been
seen
running
with
bent
back
and
with
hands
near
the
ground
like
beast
and
yet
not
beast
shape
had
eluded
capture
and
they
had
not
shot
not
knowing
whether
was
good
ill
and
had
vanished
down
the
Silverlode
southward
Also
said
Haldir
they
bring

from
the

and
Lady
the
Galadhrim
You

even
the

Gimli
seems
that
the

New

When
his
eyes
were

uncovered
Frodo
looked
and
caught
his
breath
They
were
standing
open

the
left
stood
great
mound
covered
with
sward
grass
green
Springtime
the

Upon

grew
two

and
were
leafless

their

the

were

still
arrayed

gold
High
amid
the
branches

that
stood
the
centre
all
there
gleamed
white
flet
the
feet
the
trees
and
all
about
the
green
hillsides
the
grass
was
studded
with
small
golden
flowers
shaped
like
stars
Among
them
nodding
slender
stalks
were
other
flowers
white
and
palest
green
they
glimmered
mist
amid
the
rich
hue
the
grass
Over
all
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
sun
afternoon
glowed
upon
the
hill
and
cast
long
green
shadows
beneath
the
trees
Behold
You

Cerin

said
Haldir
For
this
the
heart
the
ancient
realm

long

and
here
the

Here

Here

stay
awhile
and

The
others
cast
themselves
down
upon
the
fragrant
grass
but
Frodo
stood
awhile
still

him
that

Haldir

thought
and

smiled
You

the
Lady

said
Would

They
followed
him
stepped
lightly
the
grass
clad
slopes
Though
walked
and
breathed
and
about
him
living
leaves
and
flowers
were
stirred
the
same
cool
wind
fanned
his
face
Frodo
felt
that
was
timeless
land
that
did
not
fade
change
fall
into
forgetfulness
When
had
gone
and
passed
again
into
the
outer
world
still
Frodo
the
wanderer
from
the
Shire
would
walk
there
upon
the

They
entered

Wind

Frodo
stood
still

far
off

seas
upon
beaches
that
had
long
ago
been
washed
away
and
sea
birds
crying
whose

now

Frodo

upon

the

Haldir
took
his

and
turned
him

that
the

longed
suddenly
fly
like

Then
looked
eastward
and
saw
all

running
down
the
pale

Anduin
the
Great

lifted
his

across
the

and
all

went
out

was

Beyond
the

the

appeared
flat

empty
formless
and
vague
until
far
away

The

THE
MIRROR
GALADRIEL
The
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
mountains
and
the
shadows
were
deepening
the
woods
when
they
went
again
Their
paths
now
went
into
thickets
where
the
dusk
had
already
gathered
Night
came
beneath
the
trees
they
walked
and
the
Elves
uncovered
their
silver
lamps
Suddenly
they
came
out
into
the
open
again
and
found
themselves
under
pale
evening
sky
pricked
few
early
stars
There
was
wide
treeless
space
before
them
running
great
circle
and
bending
away
either
hand
Beyond
was
deep
fosse
lost
soft
shadow
but
the
grass
upon
its
brink
was
green
glowed
still
memory
the
sun
that
had
gone
Upon
the
further
side
there
rose
great
height
green
wall
encircling
green
hill
thronged
with
mallorn
trees
taller
than
any
they
had
yet
seen
all
the
land
Their
height
could
not
guessed
but
they
stood
the
twilight
like
living
towers
their
many
tiered
branches
and
amid
their
ever
moving
leaves
countless
lights
were
gleaming
green
and
gold
and
silver
Haldir
turned
towards
the
Company
Welcome
Caras
Galadhon
said
Here
the
city

round
the

and
the
way
not
short
for
the
city
great
There
was
road
paved
with
white
stone
running
the
outer
brink
the
fosse
Along
this
they
went
westward
with
the
city
ever
climbing
like
green
cloud
upon
their
left
and
the
night
deepened
more
lights
sprang
forth
until
all
the
hill
seemed
afire
with
stars
They
came
last
white
bridge
and
crossing
found
the
great
gates
the
city
they
faced
south
west
set
between
the
ends
the
encircling
wall
that
here
overlapped
and
they
were
tall
and
strong
and
hung
with
many
lamps
Haldir
knocked
and
spoke
and
the
gates
opened
soundlessly
but
guards
Frodo
could
see
sign
The
travellers
passed
within
and
the
gates
shut
behind
them
They
were
deep
lane
between
the
ends
the
wall
and
passing
quickly
through
they
entered
the
City
the
Trees
folk
could
they
see
nor
hear
any
feet
upon
the
paths
but
there
were
many
voices
about
them
and
the
air
above
354
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Far
away
the
hill
they
could
hear
the
sound
singing
falling
from
high
like
soft
rain
upon
leaves
They
went
along
many
paths
and
climbed
many
stairs
until
they
came
the
high
places
and
saw
before
them
amid
wide
lawn
fountain
shimmering
was
lit
silver
lamps
that
swung
from
the
boughs
trees
and
fell
into
basin
silver
from
which
white
stream
spilled
Upon
the
south
side
the
lawn
there
stood
the
mightiest
all
the
trees
its
great
smooth
bole
gleamed
like
grey
silk
and
towered
until
its
first
branches
far
above
opened
their
huge
limbs
under
shadowy
clouds
leaves
Beside
broad
white
ladder
stood
and
its
foot
three
Elves
were
seated
They
sprang
the
travellers
approached
and
Frodo
saw
that
they
were
tall
and
clad
grey
mail
and
from
their
shoulders
hung
long
white
cloaks
Here
dwell
Celeborn
and
Galadriel

Haldir
their

that
you
should
ascend
and
speak

blew

and
was
answered

times

Haldir
Let
Frodo
come
next
and

him
Legolas
The
others

for
those
that
are
not
accustomed
such

but
you
may
rest
upon
the
way
climbed
slowly
Frodo
passed
many
flets
some
one
side
some
another
and
some
set
about
the
bole
the
tree
that
the

passed
through
them

the
ground
came
wide

large
that
almost
would
have
served
for

Men
upon

entered
behind
Haldir
and
found
that
was
chamber

the
midst
which
grew
the
trunk
the
great
mallorn
now
tapering
towards
its
crown
and
yet
making
still

wide
girth
The
chamber
was
filled
with
soft
light
its
walls
were
green
and
silver
and
its
roof
gold
Many
Elves
were
seated
there
two
chairs
beneath
the
bole
the
tree
and
canopied

there
sat
side

Celeborn
and
Galadriel
They
stood
greet
their

after
the
manner
Elves
even
those
who
were
accounted
mighty
kings
Very
tall
they
were
and
the
Lady
less
tall
than
the
Lord
and
they
were
grave
and
beautiful
They
were
clad
wholly
white

was

When

the

looked

again

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Tell
now
the
full
tale
said
Celeborn
Then
Aragorn
recounted
all
that
had
happened
upon
the
pass
Caradhras
and
the
days
that
followed
and
spoke
Balin
and
his
book
and
the
fight
the
Chamber
Mazarbul
and
the
fire
and
the
narrow
bridge
and
the
coming
the
Terror
evil
the
Ancient
World
seemed
such
have
never
seen
before
said
Aragorn
was
both
shadow
and
flame
strong
and
terrible
was
Balrog
Morgoth
said
Legolas
all
elf
banes
the
most
deadly
save
the
One
who
sits
the
Dark
Tower
Indeed
saw
upon
the
bridge
that
which
haunts
our
darkest
dreams
saw
Durin
Bane
said
Gimli
low
voice
and
dread
was
his
eyes
Alas
said
Celeborn
long
have
feared
that
under
Caradhras
terror
slept
But
had
known
that
the
Dwarves
had
stirred
this
evil
Moria
again
would
have
forbidden
you
pass
the
northern
borders
you
and
all
that
went
with
you
And
were
possible
one
would
say
that
the
last
Gandalf
fell
from
wisdom
into
folly
going
needlessly
into
the
net
Moria
would
rash
indeed
that
said
that
thing
said
Galadriel
gravely
Needless
were
none
the
deeds
Gandalf
life
Those
that
followed
him
knew
not
his
mind
and
cannot
report
his
full
purpose
But
however
may
with
the
guide
the
followers
are
blameless
not
repent
your
welcome
the
Dwarf
our
folk
had
been
exiled
long
and
far
from
Lothlorien
who
the
Galadhrim
even
Celeborn
the
Wise
would
pass
nigh
and
would
not
wish
look
upon
their
ancient
home
though
had
become

Dark

before
the

beneath
the

She
looked
upon
Gimli
who
sat
glowering
and
sad
and
she
smiled
And
the
Dwarf
hearing
the
names
given
his
own
ancient
tongue
looked
and
met
her
eyes
and
seemed
him
that
looked
suddenly
into
the
heart
enemy
and
saw
there
love
and
understanding
Wonder
came
into
his
face
and
then
smiled
answer
rose
clumsily
and
bowed
dwarf
fashion
saying
Yet
more
fair
the
living
land
Lorien
and
the
Lady
Galadriel
above
all
the
jewels
that
lie
beneath

There
was
silence
length
Celeborn
spoke
again
did
not
know
that
your
plight
was
evil
said
Let
Gimli
forget
harsh
words
spoke
the
trouble
heart
will
what
can
aid
you
each
according
his
wish
and
need
but
especially
that
one
the
little
folk
who
bears
the
burden
Your
quest
known
said
Galadriel
looking
Frodo
But
THE
MIRROR
GALADRIEL
357
will
not
here
speak
more
openly
Yet
not
vain
will
prove
maybe
that
you
came
this
land
seeking
aid
Gandalf
himself
plainly
purposed
For
the
Lord
the
Galadhrim
accounted
the
wisest
the
Elves
Middle
earth
and
giver
gifts
beyond
the
power
kings
has
dwelt
the
West
since
the
days
dawn
and
have
dwelt
with
him
years
uncounted
for
ere
the
fall
Nargothrond
Gondolin
passed
over
the
mountains
and
together
through
ages
the
world
have
fought
the
long
defeat
was
who
first
summoned
the
White
Council
And
designs
had
not
gone
amiss
would
have
been
governed
Gandalf
the
Grey
and
then
mayhap
things
would
have
gone
otherwise
But
even
now
there
hope
left
will
not
give
you
counsel
saying
this
that
For
not
doing
contriving
nor
choosing
between
this
course
and
another
can
avail
but
only
knowing
what
was
and
and
part
also
what
shall
But
this
will
say
you
your
Quest
stands
upon
the
edge
knife
Stray
but
little
and
will
fail
the
ruin
all
Yet
hope
remains
while
all
the
Company
true
And
with
that
word
she
held
them
with
her
eyes
and
silence
looked
searchingly
each
them
turn
None
save
Legolas
and
Aragorn
could
long
endure
her
glance
Sam
quickly
blushed
and
hung
his
head
length
the
Lady
Galadriel
released
them
from
her
eyes
and
she
smiled
not
let
your
hearts
troubled
she
said
Tonight
you
shall
sleep
peace
Then
they
sighed
and
felt
suddenly
weary
those
who
have
been
questioned
long
and
deeply
though
words
had
been
spoken
openly
now
said
Celeborn
You
are
worn
with
sorrow
and
much
toil
Even
your
Quest
did
not
concern
closely
you
should
have
refuge
this
City
until
you
were
healed
and
refreshed
Now
you
shall
rest
and
will
not
speak
your
further
road
for
while
That
night
the
Company
slept
upon
the
ground
much
the
satisfaction
the
hobbits
The
Elves
spread
for
them
pavilion
among
the
trees
near
the
fountain
and
they
laid
soft
couches
then
speaking
words
peace
with
fair
Elvish
voices
they
left
them
For
little
while
the
travellers
talked
their
night
before
the
tree
tops
and
their
day
journey
and
the
Lord
and
Lady
for
they
had
not
yet
the
heart
look
further
back
What
did
you
blush
for
Sam
said
Pippin
You
soon
broke
down
Anyone
would
have
thought
you
had
guilty
conscience
hope
was
nothing
worse
than
wicked

never

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
didn
like
She
seemed
looking
inside
and
asking
what
would
she
gave
the
chance
flying
back
home
the
Shire
nice
little
hole
with
with
bit

own
That
funny
said
Merry
Almost
exactly
what
felt
myself
only
only
well
don
think
Pll
say
any
more
ended
lamely
All
them
seemed
had
fared
alike
each
had
felt
that
was
offered
choice
between
shadow
full
fear
that
lay
ahead
and
something
that
greatly
desired
clear
before
his
mind
lay
and
get
had
only
turn
aside
from
the
road
and
leave
the
Quest
and
the
war
against
Sauron
others
And
seemed
too
said
Gimli
that
choice
would
remain
secret
and
known
only
myself
seemed
exceedingly
strange
said
Boromir
Maybe
was
only
test
and
she
thought
read
our
thoughts
for
her
own
good
purpose
but
almost
should
have
said
that
she
was
tempting
and
offering
what
she
pretended
have
the
power
give
need
not
said
that
refused
listen
The
Men
Minas
Tirith
are
true
their
word
But
what
thought
that
the
Lady
had
offered
him
Boromir
did
not
tell
And
for
Frodo
would
not
speak
though
Boromir
pressed
him
with
questions
She
held
you
long
her
gaze
Ring
bearer
said
Yes
said
Frodo
but
whatever
came
into
mind
then
will
keep
there
Well
have
care
said
Boromir
not
feel
too
sure
this
Elvish
Lady
and
her
purposes
Speak
evil
the
Lady
Galadriel
said
Aragorn
sternly
You
know
not
what
you
say
There
her
and
this
land
evil
unless
man
bring
hither
himself
Then
let
him
beware
But
tonight
shall
sleep
without
fear
for
the
first
time
since
left
Rivendell
And
may
sleep
deep
and
forget
for
while
grief
weary
body
and
heart
cast
himself
down
upon
his
couch
and
fell
once
into
long
sleep
The
others
soon
did
the
same
and
sound
dream
disturbed
their
slumber
When
they
woke
they
found
that
the
light
day
was
broad
upon
the
lawn
before
the
pavilion
and
the
fountain
rose
and
fell
glittering
the
sun
They
remained
some
days
Lothlorien
far
they
could
tell
remember
All
the
while
that
they
dwelt
there
the
sun
shone
clear
save
for
gentle
rain
that
fell
times
and
passed
away
leaving
all
things
fresh
and
clean
The
air
was
cool
and
soft
were
early
spring
yet
they
felt
about
them
the
deep
and
thoughtful
quiet
winter
seemed
them
that
they
did
little
but
eat
and
drink
and
rest
and
walk
among
the
trees
and
was
enough
THE
MIRROR
GALADRIEL
359
They
had
not
seen
the
Lord
and
Lady
again
and
they
had
little
speech
with
the
Elven
folk
for
few
these
knew
would
use
the
Westron
tongue
Haldir
had
bidden
them
farewell
and
gone
back
again
the
fences
the
North
where
great
watch
was
now
kept
since
the
tidings
Moria
that
the
Company
had
brought
Legolas
was
away
much
among
the
Galadhrim
and
after
the
first
night
did
not
sleep
with
the
other
companions
though
returned
eat
and
talk
with
them
Often
took
Gimli
with
him
when
went
abroad
the
land
and
the
others
wondered
this
change
Now
the
companions
sat
walked
together
they
spoke
Gandalf
and
all
that
each
had
known
and
seen
him
came
clear
before
their
minds
they
were
healed
hurt
and
weariness
body
the
grief
their
loss
grew
more
keen
Often
they
heard
nearby
Elvish
voices
singing
and
knew
that
they
were
making
songs
lam
entation
for
his
fall
for
they
caught
his
name
among
the
sweet
sad
words
that
they
could
not
understand
Mithrandir
Mithrandir
sang
the
Elves
Pilgrim
Grey
For
they
loved
call
him
But
Legolas
was
with
the
Company
would
not
interpret
the
songs
for
them
saying
that
had
not
the
skill
and
that
for
him
the
grief
was
still
too
near
matter
for
tears
and
not
yet
for
song
was
Frodo
who
first
put
something
his
sorrow
into
halting
words
was
seldom
moved
make
song
rhyme
even
Riven
dell
had
listened
and
had
not
sung
himself
though
his
memory
was
stored
with
many
things
that
others
had
made
before
him
But
now
sat
beside
the
fountain
Lorien
and
heard
about
him
the
voices
the
Elves
his
thought
took
shape
song
that
seemed
fair
him
yet
when
tried
repeat
Sam
only
snatches
remained
faded
handful
withered
leaves
When
evening
the
Shire
was
grey
his
footsteps
the
Hill
were
heard
before
the
dawn
went
away

without

From

Frodo
But
that
the

can
yet
Well
Frodo
you
have
another
hope
you
say
word
about
his
fireworks
said
Sam
Something
like
this
The
finest
rockets
ever
seen
they
burst
stars
blue
and
green
after
thunder
golden
showers
came
falling
like

Though

Ill

Sam
perhaps
Bilbo
But

One
evening
Frodo
and
Sam
were
walking
together
the
cool
twilight
Both
them
felt
restless
again
Frodo
suddenly
the
shadow
parting
had
fallen
knew
somehow
that
the
time
was
very
near
when
must
leave
Lothlorien
What
you
think
Elves
now
Sam
said
asked
you
the
same
question
once
before
seems
very
long
while
ago
but
you
have
seen
more
them
since
then
have
indeed
said
Sam
And
reckon
there
Elves
and
Elves
They
all
Elvish
enough
but
they
not
all
the
same
Now
these
folk
aren
wanderers
homeless
and
seem
bit
nearer
the
likes
they
seem
belong
here
more
even
than
Hobbits
the
Shire
Whether
they
made
the
land
the
land
made
them
hard
say
you
take
meaning
wonderfully
quiet
here
THE

Nothing
seems
going
and
nobody
seems
want
there
any
magic
about
right
down
deep
where
can
lay
hands
manner
speaking
You
can
see
and
feel
everywhere
said
Frodo
Well
said
Sam
you
can
see
nobody
working
fireworks
like
poor
old
Gandalf
used
show
wonder
don
see
nothing
the
Lord
and
Lady
all
these
days
fancy
now
that
she
could
some
wonderful
things
she
had
mind
dearly
love
see
some
Elf
magic
Frodo
wouldn
said
Frodo
content
And
don
miss
Gandalf
fireworks
but
his
bushy
eyebrows
and
his
quick
temper
and
his
voice
You
right
said
Sam
And
don
think
finding
fault
often
wanted
see
bit
magic
like
what
tells
old
tales
but
never
heard
better
land
than
this
like
being
home
and
holiday
the
same
time
you
understand
don
want
leave
All
the
same
beginning
feel
that
got
then
best
get
over
the
job
that
never
started
takes
longest
finish
old
gaffer
used
say
And
don
reckon
that
these
folk
can
much
more
help
magic
when
leave
this
land
that
shall
miss
Gandalf
worse
thinking
afraid
that
only
too
true
Sam
said
Frodo
Yet
hope
very
much
that
before
leave
shall
see
the
Lady
the
Elves
again
Even
spoke
they
saw
she
came
answer
their
words
the
Lady
Galadriel
approaching
Tall
and
white
and
fair
she
walked
beneath
the
trees
She
spoke
word
but
beckoned
them
Turning
aside
she
led
them
towards
the
southern
slopes
the
hill
Caras
Galadhon
and
passing
through
high
green
hedge
they
came
into
enclosed
garden
trees
grew
there
and
lay
open
the
sky
The
evening
star
had
risen
and
was
shining
with
white
fire
above
the
western
woods
Down
long
flight
steps
the
Lady
went
into
the
deep
green
hollow
through
which
ran
murmuring
the
silver
stream
that
issued
from
the
fountain
the
hill
the
bottom
upon
low
pedestal
carved
like
branching
tree
stood
basin
silver
wide
and
shallow
and
beside
stood
silver
ewer
With
water
from
the
stream
Galadriel
filled
the
basin
the
brim
and
breathed
and
when
the
water
was
still
again
she
spoke
Here
the
Mirror
Galadriel
she
said
have
brought
you
here
that
you
may
look
you
will
The
air
was
very
still
and
the
dell
was
dark
and
the
Elf
lady
beside
him
was
tall
and
pale
What
shall
look
for
and
what
shall
see
asked
Frodo
filled
with
awe
362
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Many
things
can
command
the
Mirror
reveal
she
answered
and
some
can
show
what
they
desire
see
But
the
Mirror
will
also
show
things
unbidden
and
those
are
often
stranger
and
more
profitable
than
things
which
wish
behold
What
you
will
see
you
leave
the
Mirror
free
work
cannot
tell
For
shows
things
that
were
and
things
that
are
and
things
that
yet
may
But
which
that
sees
even
the
wisest
cannot
always
tell
you
wish
look
Frodo
did
not
answer
And
you
she
said
turning
Sam
For
this
what
your
folk
would
call
magic
believe
though
not
understand
clearly
what
they
mean
and
they
seem
use
the
same
word
the
deceits
the
Enemy
But
this
you
will
the
magic
Galadriel
Did
you
not
say
that
you
wished
see
Elf
magic
did
said
Sam
trembling
little
between
fear
and
curiosity
Pll
have
peep
Lady
you
willing
And
not
mind
glimpse
what
going
home
said
aside
Frodo
seems
terrible
long
time
that
been
away
But
there
like
not
only
see
the
stars
something
that
won
understand
Like
not
said
the
Lady
with
gentle
laugh
But
come
you
shall
look
and
see
what
you
may
not
touch
the
water
Sam
climbed
the
foot
the
pedestal
and
leaned
over
the
basin
The
water
looked
hard
and
dark
Stars
were
reflected
There
only
stars
thought
said
Then
gave
low
gasp
for
the
stars
went
out
dark
veil
had
been
withdrawn
the
Mirror
grew
grey
and
then
clear
There
was
sun
shining
and
the
branches
trees
were
waving
and
tossing
the
wind
But
before
Sam
could
make
his
mind
what
was
that
saw
the
light
faded
and
now
thought
saw
Frodo
with
pale
face
lying
fast
asleep
under
great
dark
cliff
Then
seemed
see
himself
going
along
dim
passage
and
climbing
endless
winding
stair
came
him
suddenly
that
was
looking
urgently
for
something
but
what
was
did
not
know
Like
dream
the
vision
shifted
and
went
back
and
saw
the
trees
again
But
this
time
they
were
not
close
and
could
see
what
was
going
they
were
not
waving
the
wind
they
were
falling
crashing
the
ground
cried
Sam
outraged
voice
There
that
Ted
Sandyman
cutting
down
trees
shouldn
They
didn
ought
felled
that
avenue
beyond
the
Mill
that
shades
the
road
Bywater
wish
could
get
Ted
and
fell
him
But
now
Sam
noticed
that
the
Old
Mill
had
vanished
and
large
red
brick
building
was
being
put
where
had
stood
Lots

were
busily
work
There
was
tall
red
chimney
nearby
Black
smoke
seemed
cloud
the
surface
the
Mirror
There
some
devilry
work
the
Shire
said
Elrond
knew
what
was
about
when
wanted
send
Merry
back
Then
suddenly
Sam
gave
cry
and
sprang
away
can
stay
here
said
wildly
must
home
They
dug
Bagshot
Row
and
there
the
poor
old
Gaffer
going
down
the
Hill
with
his
bits
things
barrow
must
home
You
cannot
home
alone
said
the
Lady
You
did
not
wish
home
without
your
master
before
you
looked
the
Mirror
and
yet
you
knew
that
evil
things
might
well
happening
the
Shire
Remember
that
the
Mirror
shows
many
things
and
not
all
have
yet
come
pass
Some
never
come
unless
those
that
behold
the
visions
turn
aside
from
their
path
prevent
them
The
Mirror
dangerous
guide

Sam
sat
the
ground
and
put
his
head
his
hands
wish
had
never
come
here
and
don
want
see
more
magic
said
and
fell
silent
After
moment
spoke
again
thickly
struggling
with
tears
Pll
home
the
long
road
with
Frodo
not
all
said
But
hope
get
back
some
day
what
seen
turns
out
true
somebody
going
catch
hot
you
now
wish
look
Frodo
said
the
Lady
Galadriel
You
did
not
wish
see
Elf
magic
and
were
content
you
advise
look
asked
Frodo
she
said
not
counsel
you
one
way
the
other
not
counsellor
You
may
learn
something
and
whether
what
you
see
fair
evil
that
may
profitable
and
yet
may
not
Seeing
both
good
and
perilous
Yet
think
Frodo
that
you
have
courage
and
wisdom
enough
for
the
venture
would
not
have
brought
you
here
you
will
will
look
said
Frodo
and
climbed
the
pedestal
and
bent
over
the
dark
water
once
the
Mirror
cleared
and
saw
twilit
land
Mountains
loomed
dark
the
distance
against
pale
sky
long
grey
road
wound
back
out
sight
Far
away
figure
came
slowly
down
the
road
faint
and
small
first
but
growing
larger
and
clearer
approached
Suddenly
Frodo
realized
that
reminded
him
Gandalf
almost
called
aloud
the
wizard
name
and
then
saw
that
the
figure
was
clothed
not
grey
but
white
white
that
shone
faintly
the
dusk
and
its
hand
there
was
white
staff
The
head
was
bowed
that
could
see
face
and
presently
the
figure
turned
aside
round
bend
the
road
and
went
out
the
Mirror
view
Doubt
came
into
Frodo
mind
was
this
vision
364
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Gandalf
one
his
many
lonely
journeys
long
ago
was
Saruman
The
vision
now
changed
Brief
and
small
but
very
vivid
caught
glimpse
Bilbo
walking
restlessly
about
his
room
The
table
was
littered
with
disordered
papers
rain
was
beating
the
windows
Then
there
was
pause
and
after
many
swift
scenes
followed
that
Frodo
some
way
knew
parts
great
history
which
had
become
involved
The
mist
cleared
and
saw
sight
which
had
never
seen
before
but
knew
once
the
Sea
Darkness
fell
The
sea
rose
and
raged
great
storm
Then
saw
against
the
Sun
sinking
blood
red
into
wrack
clouds
the
black
outline
tall
ship
with
torn
sails
riding
out
the
West
Then
wide
river
flowing
through
populous
city
Then
white
fortress
with
seven
towers
And
then
again
ship
with
black
sails
but
now
was
morning
again
and
the
water
rippled
with
light
and
banner
bearing
the
emblem
white
tree
shone
the
sun
smoke
fire
and
battle
arose
and
again
the
sun
went
down
burning
red
that
faded
into
grey
mist
and
into
the
mist
small
ship
passed
away
twinkling
with
lights
vanished
and
Frodo
sighed
and
prepared
draw
away
But
suddenly
the
Mirror
went
altogether
dark
dark
hole
had
opened
the
world
sight
and
Frodo
looked
into
emptiness
the
black
abyss
there
appeared
single
Eye
that
slowly
grew
until
filled
nearly
all
the
Mirror
terrible
was
that
Frodo
stood
rooted
unable
cry
out
withdraw
his
gaze
The
Eye
was
rimmed
with
fire
but
was
itself
glazed
yellow
cat
watchful
and
intent
and
the
black
slit
its
pupil
opened
pit
window
into
nothing
Then
the
Eye
began
rove
searching
this
way
and
that
and
Frodo
knew
with
certainty
and
horror
that
among
the
many
things
that
sought
himself
was
one
But
also
knew
that
could
not
see
him
not
yet
not
unless
willed
The
Ring
that
hung
upon
its
chain
about
his
neck
grew
heavy
heavier
than
great
stone
and
his
head
was
dragged
downwards
The
Mirror
seemed
growing
hot
and
curls
steam
were
rising
from
the
water
was
slipping
forward
not
touch
the
water
said
the
Lady
Galadriel
softly
The
vision
faded
and
Frodo
found
that
was
looking
the
cool
stars
twinkling
the
silver
basin
stepped
back
shaking
all
over
and
looked
the
Lady
know
what
was
that
you
last
saw
she
said
for
that
also
mind
not
afraid
But
not
think
that
only
singing
amid
the
trees
nor
even
the
slender
arrows
elven
bows
this
land
Lothlorien
maintained
and
defended
against
its
Enemy
say
you
Frodo
that
even
speak
you
perceive
the
Dark
Lord
THE
MIRROR
GALADRIEL
365
and
know
his
mind
all
his
mind
that
concerns
the
Elves
And
gropes
ever
see
and
thought
But
still
the
door
closed
She
lifted
her
white
arms
and
spread
out
her
hands
towards
the
East
gesture
rejection
and
denial
Eaérendil
the
Evening
Star
most
beloved
the
Elves
shone
clear
above
bright
was
that
the
figure
the
Elven
lady
cast
dim
shadow
the
ground
Its
rays
glanced
upon
ring
about
her
finger
glittered
like
polished
gold
overlaid
with
silver
light
and
white
stone
twinkled
the
Even
star
had
come
down
rest
upon
her
hand
Frodo
gazed
the
ring
with
awe
for
suddenly
seemed
him
that
understood
Yes
she
said
divining
his
thought
not
permitted
speak
and
Elrond
could
not
But
cannot
hidden
from
the
Ring
bearer
and
one
who
has
seen

Verily
the

upon
the

Galadriel
that
one
the

remains
This
Nenya

Adamant
and
its
keeper
suspects
but
does
not
know
not
yet
you
not
see
now
wherefore
your
coming
the
footstep
Doom
For
you
fail
then
are
laid
bare
the
Enemy
Yet
you
succeed
then
our
power
diminished
and
Lothlorien
will
fade
and
the
tides
Time
will
sweep
away
must
depart
into
the
West
dwindle
rustic
folk
dell
and
cave
slowly
forget
and
forgotten
Frodo
bent
his
head
And
what
you
wish
said
last
That
what
should
shall
she
answered
The
love
the
Elves
for
their
land
and
their
works
deeper
than
the
deeps
the
Sea
and
their
regret
undying
and
cannot
ever
wholly
assuaged
Yet
they
will
cast
all
away
rather
than
submit
Sauron
for
they
know
him
now
For
the
fate
Lothlorien
you
are
not
answerable
but
only
for
the
doing
your
own
task
Yet
could
wish
were
any
avail
that
the
One
Ring
had
never
been
wrought
had
remained
for
ever
lost
You
are
wise
and
fearless
and
fair
Lady
Galadriel
said
Frodo
will
give
you
the
One
Ring
you
ask
for
too
great
matter
for
Galadriel
laughed
with
sudden
clear
laugh
Wise
the
Lady
Galadriel
may
she
said
yet
here
she
has
met
her
match
courtesy
Gently
are
you
revenged
for
testing
your
heart
our
first
meeting
You
begin
see
with
keen
eye
not
deny
that
heart
has
greatly
desired
ask
what
you
offer
For
many
long
years
had
pondered
what
might
should
the
Great
Ring
come
into
hands
and
behold
was
brought
within
grasp
The
evil
that
was
devised
long
ago
works
many
ways
whether
Sauron
himself
stands
falls
Would
not
that
have
been
noble
deed
set
the
credit
his
Ring
had
taken
force
fear
from
guest
And
now
last
comes
You
will
give
the
Ring
freely

LORD

the
Dark
Lord
you
will
set
Queen
And
shall
not

but
beautiful

terrible

Morning
and
the
Night
Fair
the
Sea
and
the
Sun
and
the
Snow
upon
the
Mountain
Dreadful
the
Storm
and
the
Lightning
Stronger
than
the
foundations
the
earth
All
shall
love
and
despair
She
lifted
her
hand
and
from
the
ring
that
she
wore
there
issued
great
light
that
illumined
her
alone
and
left
all
else
dark
She
stood
before
Frodo
seeming
now
tall
beyond
measurement
and
beautiful
beyond
enduring
terrible
and
worshipful
Then
she
let
her
hand
fall
and
the
light
faded
and
suddenly
she
laughed
again
and
she
was
shrunken
slender
elf
woman
clad
simple
white
whose
gentle
voice
was
soft
and
sad
pass
the
test
she
said
will
diminish
and
into
the
West
and
remain
Galadriel
They
stood
for
long
while
silence
length
the
Lady
spoke
again
Let
return
she
said
the
morning
you
must
depart
for
now
have
chosen
and
the
tides
fate
are
flowing
would
ask
one
thing
before
said
Frodo
thing
which
often
meant
ask
Gandalf
Rivendell
permitted

the
One
Ring
why
cannot
see
all
the
others
and
know
the
thoughts
those
that
wear
them
You
have
not
tried
she
said
Only
thrice
have
you
set
the
Ring
upon
your
finger
since
you
knew
what
you
possessed
not
try
would
destroy
you
Did
not
Gandalf
tell
you
that
the
rings
give
power
according
the
measure
each
possessor
Before
you
could
use
that
power
you
would
need
become
far
stronger
and
train
your
will
the
domination

Yet

and
one
that

borne

and

that
which

You

more
clearly
than
many

You

And
did
you

asked
turning
again

Chapter
FAREWELL
LORIEN
That
night
the
Company
was
again
summoned
the
chamber
Celeborn
and
there
the
Lord
and
Lady
greeted
them
with
fair
words
length
Celeborn
spoke
their
departure
Now
the
time
said
when
those
who
wish
continue
the
Quest
must
harden
their
hearts
leave
this
land
Those
who
longer
wish
forward
may
remain
here
for
while
But
whether
they
stay
none
can
sure
peace
For
are
come
now
the
edge
doom
Here
those
who
wish
may
await
the
oncoming
the
hour
till
either
the
ways
the
world
lie
open
again
summon
them
the
last
need
Lorien
Then
they
may
return
their
own
lands
else
the
long
home
those
that
fall
battle
There
was
silence
They
all
resolved
forward
said
Galadriel
looking
their
eyes
for
said
Boromir
way
home
lies
onward
and
not
back
That
true
said
Celeborn
but
all
this
Company
going
with
you
Minas
Tirith
have
not
decided
our
course
said
Aragorn
Beyond
Lothlor
ien
not
know
what
Gandalf
intended
Indeed
not
think
that
even
had
any
clear
purpose
Maybe
not
said
Celeborn
yet
when
you
leave
this
land
you
can
longer
forget
the
Great
River
some
you
know
well
cannot
crossed
travellers
with
baggage
between
Lorien
and
Gondor
save
boat
And
are
not
the
bridges
Osgiliath
broken
down
and
all
the
landings
held
now
the
Enemy
which
side
will
you
journey
The
way
Minas
Tirith
lies
upon
this
side
upon
the
west
but
the
straight
road
the
Quest
lies
east
the
River
upon
the
darker
shore
Which
shore
will
you
now
take
advice
heeded
will
the
western
shore
and
the
way
Minas
Tirith
answered
Boromir
But
not
the
leader
the
Company
The
others
said
nothing
and
Aragorn
looked
doubtful
and
troubled
see
that
you
not
yet
know
what
said
Celeborn
not
part
choose
for
you
but
will
help
you
may
There
are
some
among
you
who
can
handle
boats
Legolas
whose
folk
know
the
swift
Forest
River
and
Boromir
Gondor
and
Aragorn
the
traveller
368
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
And
one
Hobbit
cried
Merry
Not
all
look
boats
wild
horses
people
live
the
banks
the
Brandywine
That
well
said
Celeborn
Then
will
furnish
your
Company
with
boats
They
must
small
and
light
for
you
far
water
there
are
places
where
you
will
forced
carry
them
You
will
come
the
rapids
Sarn
Gebir
and
maybe
last
the
great
falls
Rauros
where
the
River
thunders
down
from
Nen
Hithoel
and
there
are
other
perils
Boats
may
make
your
journey
less
toilsome
for
while
Yet
they
will
not
give
you
counsel
the
end
you
must
leave
them
and
the
River
and
turn
west
east
Aragorn
thanked
Celeborn
many
times
The
gift
boats
com
forted
him
much
not
least
because
there
would
now
need
decide
his
course
for
some
days
The
others
too
looked
more
hope
ful
Whatever
perils
lay
ahead
seemed
better
float
down
the
broad
tide
Anduin
meet
them
than
plod
forward
with
bent
backs
Only
Sam
was
doubtful
any
rate
still
thought
boats
bad
wild
horses
worse
and
not
all
the
dangers
that
had
survived
made
him
think
better
them
All
shall
prepared
for
you
and
await
you
the
haven
before
noon
tomorrow
said
Celeborn
will
send
people
you
the
morning
help
you
make
ready
for
the
journey
Now
will
wish
you
all
fair
night
and
untroubled
sleep
Good
night
friends
said
Galadriel
Sleep
peace
not
trouble
your
hearts
overmuch
with
thought
the
road
tonight
Maybe
the
paths
that
you
each
shall
tread
are
already
laid
before
your
feet
though
you
not
see
them
Good
night
The
Company
now
took
their
leave
and
returned
their
pavilion
Legolas
went
with
them
for
this
was
their
last
night
Loth
lorien
and
spite
the
words
Galadriel
they
wished
take
counsel
together
For
long
time
they
debated
what
they
should
and
how
would
best
attempt
the
fulfilling
their
purpose
with
the
Ring
but
they
came
decision
was
plain
that
most
them
desired
first
Minas
Tirith
and
escape
least
for
while
from
the
terror
the
Enemy
They
would
have
been
willing
follow
leader
over
the
River
and
into
the
shadow
Mordor
but
Frodo
spoke
word
and
Aragorn
was
still
divided
his
mind
His
own
plan
while
Gandalf
remained
with
them
had
been
with
Boromir
and
with
his
sword
help
deliver
Gondor
For
believed
that
the
message
the
dreams
was
summons
and
that
the
hour
had
come
last
when
the
heir
Elendil
should
come
forth
and
strive
with
Sauron
for
the
mastery
But
Moria
the
burden
Gandalf
had
been
laid
him
and
knew
that
could
not
now
FAREWELL
LORIEN
369
forsake
the
Ring
Frodo
refused
the
end
with
Boromir
And
yet
what
help
could
any
the
Company
give
Frodo
save
walk
blindly
with
him
into
the
darkness
shall
Minas
Tirith
alone
need
for
duty
said
Boromir
and
after
that
was
silent
for
while
sitting
with
his
eyes
fixed
Frodo
was
trying
read
the
Halfling
thoughts
length
spoke
again
softly
was
debating
with
himself
you
wish
only
destroy
the
Ring
said
then
there
little
use
war
and
weapons
and
the
Men
Minas
Tirith
cannot
help
But
you
wish
destroy
the
armed
might
the
Dark
Lord
then
folly
without
force
into
his
domain
and
folly
throw
away
paused
suddenly
had
become
aware
that
was
speaking
his
thoughts
aloud
would
folly
throw
lives
away
mean
ended
choice
between
defending
strong
place
and
walking
openly
into
the
arms
death
least
that
how
see
Frodo
caught
something
new
and
strange
Boromir
glance
and
looked
hard
him
Plainly
Boromir
thought
was
different
from
his
final
words
would
folly
throw
away
what
The
Ring
Power
had
said
something
like
this
the
Council
but
then
had
accepted
the
correction
Elrond
Frodo
looked
Aragorn
but
seemed
deep
his
own
thought
and
made
sign
that
had
heeded
Boromir
words
And
their
debate
ended
Merry
and
Pippin
were
already
asleep
and
Sam
was
nodding
The
night
was
growing
old
the
morning
they
were
beginning
pack
their
slender
goods
Elves
that
could
speak
their
tongue
came
them
and
brought
them
many
gifts
food
and
clothing
for
the
journey
The
food
was
mostly
the
form
very
thin
cakes
made
meal
that
was
baked
light
brown
the
outside
and
inside
was
the
colour
cream
Gimli
took
one
the
cakes
and
looked
with
doubtful
eye
Cram
said
under
his
breath
broke
off
crisp
corner
and
nibbled
His
expression
quickly
changed
and
ate
all
the
rest
the
cake
with
relish
more
more
cried
the
Elves
laughing
You
have
eaten
enough
already
for
long
day
march
thought
was
only
kind
cram
such
the
Dale
men
make
for
journeys
the
wild
said
the
Dwarf
they
answered
But
call
lembas
waybread
and
more
strengthening
than
any
food
made
Men
and
more
pleasant
than
cram
all
accounts
Indeed
said
Gimli
Why
better
than
the
honey
cakes
the
Beornings
and
that
great
praise
for
the
Beornings
are
the
370
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
best
bakers
that
know
but
they
are
none
too
willing
deal
out
their
cakes
travellers
these
days
You
are
kindly
hosts
All
the
same
bid
you
spare
the
food
they
said
Eat
little
time
and
only
need
For
these
things
are
given
serve
you
when
all
else
fails
The
cakes
will
keep
sweet
for
many
many
days
they
are
unbroken
and
left
their
leaf
wrappings
have
brought
them
One
will
keep
traveller
his
feet
for
day
long
labour
even
one
the
tall
Men
Minas
Tirith
The
Elves
next
unwrapped
and
gave
each
the
Company
the
clothes
they
had
brought
For
each
they
had
provided
hood
and
cloak
made
according
his
size
the
light
but
warm
silken
stuff
that
the
Galadhrim
wove
was
hard
say
what
colour
they
were
grey
with
the
hue
twilight
under
the
trees
they
seemed
and
yet
they
were
moved
set
another
light
they
were
green
shadowed
leaves
brown
fallow
fields
night
dusk
silver
water
under
the
stars
Each
cloak
was
fastened
about
the
neck
with
brooch
like
green
leaf
veined
with
silver
Are
these
magic
cloaks
asked
Pippin
looking
them
with
wonder
not
know
what
you
mean
that
answered
the
leader
the
Elves
They
are
fair
garments
and
the
web
good
for
was
made
this
land
They
are
Elvish
robes
certainly
that
what
you
mean
Leaf
and
branch
water
and
stone
they
have
the
hue
and
beauty
all
these
things
under
the
twilight
Lorien
that
love
for
put
the
thought
all
that
love
into
all
that
make
Yet
they
are
garments
not
armour
and
they
will
not
turn
shaft
blade
But
they
should
serve
you
well
they
are
light
wear
and
warm
enough
cool
enough
need
And
you
will
find
them
great
aid
keeping
out
the
sight
unfriendly
eyes
whether
you
walk
among
the
stones
the
trees
You
are
indeed
high
the
favour
the
Lady
For
she
herself
and
her
maidens
wove
this
stuff
and
never
before
have
clad
strangers
the
garb
our
own
people
After
their
morning
meal
the
Company
said
farewell
the
lawn
the
fountain
Their
hearts
were
heavy
for
was
fair
place
and
had
become
like
home
them
though
they
could
not
count
the
days
and
nights
that
they
had
passed
there
they
stood
for
moment
looking
the
white
water
the
sunlight
Haldir
came
walking
towards
them
over
the
green
grass
the
glade
Frodo
greeted
him
with
delight
have
returned
from
the
Northern
Fences
said
the
Elf
and
sent
now
your
guide
again
The
Dimrill
Dale
full
vapour
and
clouds
smoke
and
the
mountains
are
troubled
There
are
noises
the
deeps
the
earth
any
you
had
thought
FAREWELL
LORIEN
371
returning
northwards
your
homes
you
would
not
have
been
able
pass
that
way
But
come
Your
path
now
goes
south
they
walked
through
Caras
Galadhon
the
green
ways
were
empty
but
the
trees
above
them
many
voices
were
murmuring
and
singing
They
themselves
went
silently
last
Haldir
led
them
down
the
southward
slopes
the
hill
and
they
came
again
the
great
gate
hung
with
lamps
and
the
white
bridge
and
they
passed
out
and
left
the
city
the
Elves
Then
they
turned
away
from
the
paved
road
and
took
path
that
went
off
into
deep
thicket
mallorn
trees
and
passed
winding
through
rolling
woodlands
silver
shadow
leading
them
ever
down
southwards
and
eastwards
towards
the
shores
the
River
They
had
gone
some
ten
miles
and
noon
was
hand
when
they
came
high
green
wall
Passing
through
opening
they
came
suddenly
out
the
trees
Before
them
lay
long
lawn
shining
grass
studded
with
golden
edanor
that
glinted
the
sun
The
lawn
ran
out
into
narrow
tongue
between
bright
margins
the
right
and
west
the
Silverlode
flowed
glittering
the
left
and
east
the
Great
River
rolled
its
broad
waters
deep
and
dark
the
further
shores
the
woodlands
still
marched
southwards
far
eye
could
see
but
all
the
banks
were
bleak
and
bare
mallorn
lifted
its
gold
hung
boughs
beyond
the
Land
Lorien
the
bank
the
Silverlode
some
distance
from
the
meet
ing
the
streams
there
was
hythe
white
stones
and
white
wood
were
moored
many
boats
and
barges
Some
were
brightly
painted
and
shone
with
silver
and
gold
and
green
but
most
were
either
white
grey
Three
small
grey
boats
had
been
made
ready
for
the
travellers
and
these
the
Elves
stowed
their
goods
And
they
added
also
coils
rope
three
each
boat
Slender
they
looked
but
strong
silken
the
touch
grey
hue
like
the
elven
cloaks
What
are
these
asked
Sam
handling
one
that
lay
upon
the
greensward
Ropes
indeed
answered
Elf
from
the
boats
Never
travel
far
without
rope
And
one
that
long
and
strong
and
light
Such
are
these
They
may
help
many
needs
You
don
need
tell
that
said
Sam
came
without
any
and
been
worried
ever
since
But
was
wondering
what
these
were
made
knowing
bit
about
rope
making
the
family
you
might
say
They
are
made
hithlain
said
the
Elf
but
there
time
now
instruct
you
the
art
their
making
Had
known
that
this
craft
delighted
you
could
have
taught
you
much
But
now
alas
unless
you
should
some
time
return
hither
you
must
content
with
our
gift
May
serve
you
well
372
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Come
said
Haldir
All
now
ready
for
you
Enter
the
boats
But
take
care
first
Heed
the
words
said
the
other
Elves
These
boats
are
light
built
and
they
are
crafty
and
unlike
the
boats
other
folk
They
will
not
sink
lade
them
you
will
but
they
are
wayward
mishandled
would
wise
you
accustomed
yourselves
stepping
and
out
here
where
there
landing
place
before
you
set
off
downstream
The
Company
was
arranged
this
way
Aragorn
Frodo
and
Sam
were
one
boat
Boromir
Merry
and
Pippin
another
and
the
third
were
Legolas
and
Gimli
who
had
now
become
fast
friends
this
last
boat
most
the
goods
and
packs
were
stowed
The
boats
were
moved
and
steered
with
short
handled
paddles
that
had
broad
leaf
shaped
blades
When
all
was
ready
Aragorn
led
them
trial
the
Silverlode
The
current
was
swift
and
they
went
forward
slowly
Sam
sat
the
bows
clutching
the
sides
and
looking
back
wistfully
the
shore
The
sunlight
glittering
the
water
dazzled
his
eyes
they
passed
beyond
the
green
field
the
Tongue
the
trees
drew
down
the
river
brink
Here
and
there
golden
leaves
tossed
and
floated
the
rippling
stream
The
air
was
very
bright
and
still
and
there
was
silence
except
for
the
high
distant
song
larks
They
turned
sharp
bend
the
river
and
there
sailing
proudly
down
the
stream
towards
them
they
saw
swan
great
size
The
water
rippled
either
side
the
white
breast
beneath
its
curving
neck
Its
beak
shone
like
burnished
gold
and
its
eyes
glinted
like
jet
set
yellow
stones
its
huge
white
wings
were
half
lifted
music
came
down
the
river
drew
nearer
and
suddenly
they
perceived
that
was
ship
wrought
and
carved
with
elven
skill
the
likeness
bird
Two
elves
clad
white
steered
with
black
paddles
the
midst
the
vessel
sat
Celeborn
and
behind
him
stood
Galadriel
tall
and
white
circlet
golden
flowers
was
her
hair
and
her
hand
she
held
harp
and
she
sang
Sad
and
sweet
was
the
sound
her
voice
the
cool
clear
air
sang
leaves
leaves
gold
and
leaves
gold
there
grew
wind
sang
wind
there
came
and
the
branches
blew
Beyond
the
Sun
beyond
the
Moon
the
foam
was
the
Sea
And
the
strand
Ilmarin
there
grew
golden
Tree
Beneath
the
stars
Ever
eve
Eldamar
shone
Eldamar
beside
the
walls
Elven
Tirion
There
long
the
golden
leaves
have
grown
upon
the
branching
years
While
here
beyond
the
Sundering
Seas
now
fall
the
Elven
tears
FAREWELL
LORIEN
373
Lorien
The
Winter
comes
the
bare
and
leafless
Day
The
leaves
are
falling
the
stream
the
River
flows
away
Lorien
Too
long
have
dwelt
upon
this
Hither
Shore
And
fading
crown
have
twined
the
golden
elanor
But
ships
now
should
sing
what
ship
would
come
What
ship
would
bear
ever
back
across
wide
Sea
Aragorn
stayed
his
boat
the
Swan
ship
drew
alongside
The
Lady
ended
her
song
and
greeted
them
have
come
bid
our
last
farewell
she
said
and
speed
you
with
blessings
from
our
land
Though
you
have
been
our
guests
said
Celeborn
you
have
not
yet
eaten
with
and
bid
you
therefore
parting
feast
here
between
the
flowing
waters
that
will
bear
you
far
from
Lorien
The
Swan
passed
slowly
the
hythe
and
they
turned
their
boats
and
followed
There
the
last
end
Egladil
upon
the
green
grass
the
parting
feast
was
held
but
Frodo
ate
and
drank
little
heeding
only
the
beauty
the
Lady
and
her
voice
She
seemed
longer
perilous
terrible
nor
filled
with
hidden
power
Already
she
seemed
him
men
later
days
Elves
still
times
are
seen
present
and
yet
remote
living
vision
that
which
has
already
been
left
far
behind
the
flowing
streams
Time
After
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
sitting
upon
the
grass
Celeborn
spoke
them
again
their
journey
and
lifting
his
hand
pointed
south
the
woods
beyond
the
Tongue
you
down
the
water
said
you
will
find
that
the
trees
will
fail
and
you
will
come
barren
country
There
the
River
flows
stony
vales
amid
high
moors
until
last
after
many
leagues
comes
the
tall
island
the
Tindrock
that
call
Tol
Brandir
There
casts
its
arms
about
the
steep
shores
the
isle
and
falls
then
with
great
noise
and
smoke
over
the
cataracts
Rauros
down
into
the
Nindalf
the
Wetwang
called
your
tongue
That
wide
region
sluggish
fen
where
the
stream
becomes
tortuous
and
much
divided
There
the
Entwash
flows
many
mouths
from
the
Forest
Fangorn
the
west
About
that
stream
this
side
the
Great
River
lies
Rohan
the
further
side
are
the
bleak
hills
the
Emyn
Muil
The
wind
blows
from
the
East
there
for
they
look
out
over
the
Dead
Marshes
and
the
Noman
lands
Cirith
Gorgor
and
the
black
gates
Mordor
Boromir
and
any
that
with
him
seeking
Minas
Tirith
will
well
leave
the
Great
River
above
Rauros
and
cross
the
Entwash
before
finds
the
marshes
Yet
they
should
not
too
far
that
stream
nor
risk
becoming
entangled
the
Forest
Fangorn
That
374
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
strange
land
and
now
little
known
But
Boromir
and
Aragorn
doubtless
not
need
this
warning
Indeed
have
heard
Fangorn
Minas
Tirith
said
Boromir
But
what
have
heard
seems
for
the
most
part
old
wives
tales
such
tell
our
children
All
that
lies
north
Rohan
now
far
away
that
fancy
can
wander
freely
there
old
Fangorn
lay
upon
the
borders
our
realm
but
now
many
lives
men
since
any
visited
prove
disprove
the
legends
that
have
come
down
from
distant
years
have
myself
been
whiles
Rohan
but
have
never
crossed
northwards
When
was
sent
out
messenger
passed
through
the
Gap
the
skirts
the
White
Mountains
and
crossed
the
Isen
and
the
Greyflood
into
Northerland
long
and
wearisome
journey
Four
hundred
leagues
reckoned
and
took
many
months
for
lost
horse
Tharbad
the
fording
the
Greyflood
After
that
journey
and
the
road
have
trodden
with
this
Company
not
much
doubt
that
shall
find
way
through
Rohan
and
Fangorn
too
need
Then
need
say
more
said
Celeborn
But
not
despise
the
lore
that
has
come
down
from
distant
years
for
oft
may
chance
that
old
wives
keep
memory
word
things
that
once
were
needful
for
the
wise
know
Now
Galadriel
rose
from
the
grass
and
taking
cup
from
one
her
maidens
she
filled
with
white
mead
and
gave
Celeborn
Now
time
drink
the
cup
farewell
she
said
Drink
Lord
the
Galadhrim
And
let
not
your
heart
sad
though
night
must
follow
noon
and
already
our
evening
draweth
nigh
Then
she
brought
the
cup
each
the
Company
and
bade
them
drink
and
farewell
But
when
they
had
drunk
she
commanded
them
sit
again
the
grass
and
chairs
were
set
for
her
and
for
Celeborn
Her
maidens
stood
silent
about
her
and
while
she
looked
upon
her
guests
last
she
spoke
again
have
drunk
the
cup
parting
she
said
and
the
shadows
fall
between
But
before
you
have
brought
ship
gifts
which
the
Lord
and
Lady
the
Galadhrim
now
offer
you
memory
Lothlorien
Then
she
called
each
turn
Here
the
gift
Celeborn
and
Galadriel
the
leader
your
Company
she
said
Aragorn
and
she
gave
him
sheath
that
had
been
made
fit
his
sword
was
overlaid
with
tracery
flowers
and
leaves
wrought
silver
and
gold
and
were
set
elven
runes
formed
many
gems
the
name
Anduril
and
the
lineage
the
sword
The
blade
that
drawn
from
this
sheath
shall
not
stained
broken
even
defeat
she
said
But
there
aught
else
that
you
FAREWELL
LORIEN
375
desire
our
parting
For
darkness
will
flow
between
and
may
that
shall
not
meet
again
unless
far
hence
upon
road
that
has
returning
And
Aragorn
answered
Lady
you
know
all
desire
and
long
held
keeping
the
only
treasure
that
seek
Yet
not
yours
give
even
you
would
and
only
through
darkness
shall
come
Yet
maybe
this
will
lighten
your
heart
said
Galadriel
for
was
left
care
given
you
should
you
pass
through
this
land
Then
she
lifted
from
her
lap
great
stone
clear
green
set
silver
brooch
that
was
wrought
the
likeness
eagle
with
out
spread
wings
and
she
held
the
gem
flashed
like
the
sun
shining
through
the
leaves
spring
This
stone
gave
Celebrian
daughter
and
she
hers
and
now
comes
you
token
hope
this
hour
take
the
name
that
was
foretold
for
you
Elessar
the
Elfstone
the
House
Elendill
Then
Aragorn
took
the
stone
and
pinned
the
brooch
upon
his
breast
and
those
who
saw
him
wondered
for
they
had
not
marked
before
how
tall
and
kingly
stood
and
seemed
them
that
many
years
toil
had
fallen
from
his
shoulders
For
the
gifts
that
you
have
given
thank
you
said
Lady
Lorien
whom
were
sprung
Celebrian
and
Arwen
Evenstar
What
praise
could
say
more
The
Lady
bowed
her
head
and
she
turned
then
Boromir
and
him
she
gave
belt
gold
and
Merry
and
Pippin
she
gave
small
silver
belts
each
with
clasp
wrought
like
golden
flower
Legolas
she
gave
bow
such
the
Galadhrim
used
longer
and
stouter
than
the
bows
Mirkwood
and
strung
with
string
elf
hair
With
went
quiver
arrows
For
you
little
gardener
and
lover
trees
she
said
Sam
have
only
small
gift
She
put
into
his
hand
little
box
plain
grey
wood
unadorned
save
for
single
silver
rune
upon
the
lid
Here
set
for
Galadriel
she
said
but
also
may
stand

and
such
blessing
Galadriel
has
still
bestow
upon
will
not
keep
you
your
road
nor
defend
you
against
any
peril
but
you
keep
and
see
your
home
again
last
then
perhaps
may
reward
you
Though
you
should
find
all
barren
and
laid
waste
there
will
few
gardens
Middle
earth
that
will
bloom
like
your
garden
you
sprinkle
this

there
Then
you
may
remember
Galadriel
and
catch
glimpse
far
off
Lorien
that
you
have
seen
only
our
winter
For
our
Spring
and
our
Summer
are
gone
and
they
will
never
seen
earth
again
save
memory
Sam
went
red
the
ears
and
muttered
something
inaudible
clutched
the
box
and
bowed
well
could

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
And
what
gift
would
Dwarf
ask
the
Elves
said
Galadriel
turning
Gimli
None
Lady
answered
Gimli
enough
for
have
seen
the
Lady
the
Galadhrim
and
have
heard
her
gentle
words
Hear
all
Elves
she
cried
those
about
her
Let
none
say
again
that
Dwarves
are
grasping
and
ungracious
Yet
surely
Gimli
son
Gloin
you
desire
something
that
could
give
Name
bid
you
You
shall
not
the
only
guest
without

There

Lady
Galadriel
said
Gimli
bowing
low
and
stammering
Nothing
unless

unless

ask

name
single
strand
your
hair
which
surpasses
the
gold
the
earth
the

mine
not
ask
for
such
gift
But
you
commanded
name
desire
The
Elves
stirred
and
murmured
with
astonishment
and
Celeborn
gazed
the
Dwarf
wonder
but
the
Lady
smiled
said
that
the
skill
the
Dwarves
their
hands
rather
than
their
tongues
she
said
yet
that
not
true
Gimli
For
none
have
ever
made
request
bold
and
yet
courteous
And
how
shall
refuse
since
commanded
him
speak
But
tell
what
would
you
with
such
gift
Treasure
Lady
answered
memory
your
words
our
first
meeting
And
ever
return
the

home
shall
set
imperishable
crystal
heirloom
house
and
pledge
good
will
between
the
Mountain
and
the
Wood
until
the
end
days
Then
the
Lady
unbraided
one
her
long
tresses
and
cut
off
three
golden
hairs
and
laid
them
Gimli
hand
These
words
shall
with
the
gift
she
said
not
foretell
for
all
foretelling
now
vain
the
one
hand
lies
darkness
and
the
other
only
hope
But
hope
should
not
fail
then
say
you
Gimli
son
Gloin
that
your
hands
shall
flow
with
gold
and
yet
over
you
gold
shall
have
dominion
And
you
Ring
bearer
she
said
turning
Frodo
come
you
last
who
are
not
last
thoughts
For
you
have
prepared
this
She
held
small
crystal
phial
glittered
she
moved
and
rays
white
light
sprang
from
her
hand
this
phial
she
said
caught

will
shine
still
brighter
when
night
about
you
May
light
you

when
all
other
lights
out
Remember
Galadriel
and
her
Mirror
Frodo
took
the
phial
and
for
moment
shone
between
them
saw
her
again
standing
like
queen
great
and
beautiful
but
longer
terrible
bowed
but
found
words
say
FAREWELL
LORIEN
377
Now
the
Lady
arose
and
Celeborn
led
them
back
the
hythe
yellow
noon
lay
the
green
land
the
Tongue
and
the
water
glittered
with
silver
All
last
was
made
ready
The
Company
took
their
places
the
boats
before
Crying
farewell
the
Elves
Lorien
with
long
grey
poles
thrust
them
out
into
the
flowing
stream
and
the
rippling
waters
bore
them
slowly
away
The
travellers
sat
still
without
moving
speaking
the
green
bank
near
the
very
point
the
Tongue
the
Lady
Galadriel
stood
alone
and
silent
they
passed
her
they
turned
and
their
eyes
watched
her
slowly
floating
away
from
them
For
seemed
them
Lorien
was
slipping
backward
like
bright
ship
masted
with
enchanted
trees
sailing
forgotten
shores
while
they
sat
helpless
upon
the
margin
the
grey
and
leafless
world
Even
they
gazed
the
Silverlode
passed
out
into
the
currents
the
Great
River
and
their
boats
turned
and
began
speed
south
ward
Soon
the
white
form
the
Lady
was
small
and
distant
She
shone
like
window
glass
upon
far
hill
the
westering
sun
remote
lake
seen
from
mountain
crystal
fallen
the
lap
the
land
Then
seemed
Frodo
that
she
lifted
her
arms
final
farewell
and
far
but
piercing
clear
the
following
wind
came
the
sound
her
voice
singing
But
now
she
sang
the
ancient
tongue
the
Elves
beyond
the
Sea
and
did
not
understand
the
words
fair
was
the
music
but
did
not
comfort
him
Yet
the
way
Elvish
words
they
remained
graven
his
memory
and
long
afterwards
interpreted
them
well
could
the
language
was
that
Elven
song
and
spoke

Suddenly
the
River
swept
round
bend
and
the
banks
rose
upon
either
side
and
the
light
Lorien
was
hidden
that
fair
land
Frodo
never
came
again
The
travellers
now
turned
their
faces
the
journey
the
sun
was
before
them
and
their
eyes
were
dazzled
for
all
were
filled
with
tears
Gimli
wept
openly
have
looked
the
last
upon
that
which
was
fairest
said
Legolas
his
companion
Henceforward
will
call
nothing
fair
unless
her
gift
put
his
hand
his
breast
Tell
Legolas
why
did
come
this
Quest
Little
did
know
where
the
chief
peril
lay
Truly
Elrond
spoke
saying
that
could
not
foresee
what
might
meet
upon
our
road
Torment
the
dark
was
the
danger
that
feared
and
did
not
hold
back
But
would
not
have
come
had
known
the
danger
light
and
joy
Now
have
taken
worst
wound
this
parting
even
were
this
night
straight
the
Dark
Lord
Alas
for
Gimli
son
Gloin
Nay
said
Legolas
Alas
for
all
And
for
all
that
walk
the
world
these
after
days
For
such
the
way
find
and
lose
seems
those
whose
boat
the
running
stream
But
count
you
blessed
Gimli
son
Gloin
for
your
loss
you
suffer
your
own
free
will
and
you
might
have
chosen
otherwise
But
you
have
not
forsaken
your
companions
and
the
least
reward
that
you
shall
have
that
the
memory
Lothlorien
shall
remain
ever
clear
and
unstained
your
heart
and
shall
neither
fade
nor
grow
stale
Maybe
said
Gimli
and
thank
you
for
your
words
True
words
doubtless
yet
all
such
comfort
cold
Memory
not
what
the
heart
desires
That

says

Indeed
FAREWELL
LORIEN
379
have
heard
that
for
them
memory
more
like
the
waking
world
than
dream
Not
for
Dwarves
But
let
talk
more
Look
the
boat
She
too
low
the
water
with
all
this
baggage
and
the
Great
River
swift
not
wish
drown
grief
cold
water
took
paddle
and
steered
towards
the
western
bank
following
Aragorn
boat
ahead
which
had
already
moved
out
the
middle
stream
the
Company
went
their
long
way
down
the
wide
hurrying
waters
borne
ever
southwards
Bare
woods
stalked
along
either
bank
and
they
could
not
see
any
glimpse
the
lands
behind
The
breeze
died
away
and
the
River
flowed
without
sound
voice
bird
broke
the
silence
The
sun
grew
misty
the
day
grew
old
until
gleamed
pale
sky
like
high
white
pearl
Then
faded
into
the
West
and
dusk
came
early
followed
grey
and
starless
night
Far
into
the
dark
quiet
hours
they
floated
guiding
their
boats
under
the
overhanging
shadows
the
western
woods
Great
trees
passed
like
ghosts
thrusting
their
twisted
thirsty
roots
through
the
mist
down
into
the
water
was
dreary
and
cold
Frodo
sat
and
listened
the
faint
lap
and
gurgle
the
River
fretting
among
the
tree
roots
and
driftwood
near
the
shore
until
his
head
nodded
and
fell
into
uneasy
sleep
Chapter
THE
GREAT
RIVER
Frodo
was
roused
Sam
found
that
was
lying
well
wrapped
under
tall
grey
skinned
trees
quiet
corner
the
woodlands
the
west
bank
the
Great
River
Anduin
had
slept
the
night
away
and
the
grey
morning
was
dim
among
the
bare
branches
Gimli
was
busy
with
small
fire
near
hand
They
started
again
before
the
day
was
broad
Not
that
most
the
Company
were
eager
hurry
southwards
they
were
content
that
the
decision
which
they
must
make
latest
when
they
came
Rauros
and
the
Tindrock
Isle
still
lay
some
days
ahead
and
they
let
the
River
bear
them
its
own
pace
having
desire
hasten
towards
the
perils
that
lay
beyond
whichever
course
they
took
the
end
Aragorn
let
them
drift
with
the
stream
they
wished
hus
banding
their
strength
against
weariness
come
But
insisted
that
least
they
should
start
early
each
day
and
journey
far
into
the
evening
for
felt
his
heart
that
time
was
pressing
and
feared
that
the
Dark
Lord
had
not
been
idle
while
they
lingered
Lorien
Nonetheless
they
saw
sign
any
enemy
that
day
nor
the
next
The
dull
grey
hours
passed
without
event
the
third
day
their
voyage
wore
the
lands
changed
slowly
the
trees
thinned
and
then
failed
altogether
the
eastern
bank
their
left
they
saw
long
formless
slopes
stretching
and
away
towards
the
sky
brown
and
withered
they
looked
fire
had
passed
over
them
leaving
living
blade
green
unfriendly
waste
without
even
broken
tree
bold
stone
relieve
the
emptiness
They
had
come
the
Brown
Lands
that
lay
vast
and
desolate
between
Southern
Mirkwood
and
the
hills
the
Emyn
Muil
What
pestilence
war
evil
deed
the
Enemy
had
blasted
all
that
region
even
Aragorn
could
not
tell
Upon
the
west
their
right
the
land
was
treeless
also
but
was
flat
and
many
places
green
with
wide
plains
grass
this
side
the
River
they
passed
forests
great
reeds
tall
that
they
shut
out
all
view
the
west
the
little
boats
went
rustling
along
their
fluttering
borders
Their
dark
withered
plumes
bent
and
tossed
the
light
cold
airs
hissing
softly
and
sadly
Here
and
there
through
openings
Frodo
could
catch
sudden
glimpses
rolling
meads
and
far
beyond
them
hills
the
sunset
and
away
the
edge
sight
dark
line
where
marched
the
southernmost
ranks
the
Misty
Mountains
THE
GREAT
RIVER
381
There
was
sign
living
moving
things
save
birds
these
there
were
many
small
fowl
whistling
and
piping
the
reeds
but
they
were
seldom
seen
Once
twice
the
travellers
heard
the
rush
and
whine
swan
wings
and
looking
they
saw
great
phalanx
streaming
along
the
sky
Swans
said
Sam
And
mighty
big
ones
too
Yes
said
Aragorn
and
they
are
black
swans
How
wide
and
empty
and
mournful
all
this
country
looks
said
Frodo
always
imagined
that
one
journeyed
south
got
warmer
and
merrier
until
winter
was
left
behind
for
ever
But
have
not
journeyed
far
south
yet
answered
Aragorn
still
winter
and
are
far
from
the
sea
Here
the
world
cold
until
the
sudden
spring
and
may
yet
have
snow
again
Far
away
down
the
Bay
Belfalas
which
Anduin
runs
warm
and
merry
maybe
would
but
for
the
Enemy
But
here
are
not
above
sixty
leagues
guess
south
the
Southfarthing
away
your
Shire
hundreds
long
miles
yonder
You
are
looking
now
south
west
across
the
north
plains
the
Riddermark
Rohan
the
land
the
Horse
lords
Ere
long
shall
come
the
mouth
the
Limlight
that
runs
down
from
Fangorn
join
the
Great
River
That
the
north
boundary
Rohan
and
old
all
that
lay
between
Limlight
and
the
White
Mountains
belonged
the
Rohirrim
rich
and
pleasant
land
and
its
grass
has
rival
but
these
evil
days
folk
not
dwell
the
River
ride
often
its
shores
Anduin
wide
yet
the
orcs
can
shoot
their
arrows
far
across
the
stream
and
late
said
they
have
dared
cross
the
water
and
raid
the
herds
and
studs
Rohan
Sam
looked
from
bank
bank
uneasily
The
trees
had
seemed
hostile
before
they
harboured
secret
eyes
and
lurking
dangers
now
wished
that
the
trees
were
still
there
felt
that
the
Company
was
too
naked
afloat
little
open
boats
the
midst
shelterless
lands
and
river
that
was
the
frontier
war
the
next
day
two
they
went
borne
steadily
southwards
this
feeling
insecurity
grew
all
the
Company
For
whole
day
they
took
their
paddles
and
hastened
forward
The
banks
slid
Soon
the
River
broadened
and
grew
more
shallow
long
stony
beaches
lay
upon
the
east
and
there
were
gravel
shoals
the
water
that
careful
steering
was
needed
The
Brown
Lands
rose
into
bleak
wolds
over
which
flowed
chill
air
from
the
East
the
other
side
the
meads
had
become
rolling
downs
withered
grass
amidst
land
fen
and
tussock
Frodo
shivered
thinking
the
lawns
and
fountains
the
clear
sun
and
gentle
rains
Lothlorien
There
was
little
speech
and
laughter
any
the
boats
Each
member
the
Company
was
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
382
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
The
heart
Legolas
was
running
under
the
stars
summer
night
some
northern
glade
amid
the
beech
woods
Gimli
was
fingering
gold
his
mind
and
wondering
were
fit
wrought
into
the
housing
the
Lady
gift
Merry
and
Pippin
the
middle
boat
were
ill
ease
for
Boromir
sat
muttering
himself
sometimes
biting
his
nails
some
restlessness
doubt
consumed
him
some
times
seizing
paddle
and
driving
the
boat
close
behind
Aragorn
Then
Pippin
who
sat
the
bow
looking
back
caught
queer
gleam
his
eye
peered
forward
gazing
Frodo
Sam
had
long
ago
made
his
mind
that
though
boats
were
maybe
not
dangerous
had
been
brought
believe
they
were
far
more
uncomfort
able
than
even
had
imagined
was
cramped
and
miserable
having
nothing
but
stare
the
winter
lands
crawling
and
the
grey
water
either
side
him
Even
when
the
paddles
were
use
they
did
not
trust
Sam
with
one
dusk
drew
down
the
fourth
day
was
looking
back
over
the
bowed
heads
Frodo
and
Aragorn
and
the
following
boats
was
drowsy
and
longed
for
camp
and
the
feel
earth
under
his
toes
Suddenly
something
caught
his
sight
first
stared
listlessly
then
sat
and
rubbed
his
eyes
but
when
looked
again
could
not
see
any
more
That
night
they
camped
small
eyot
close
the
western
bank
Sam
lay
rolled
blankets
beside
Frodo
had
funny
dream
hour
two
before
stopped
Frodo
said
maybe
wasn
dream
Funny
was
anyway
Well
what
was
said
Frodo
knowing
that
Sam
would
not
settle
down
until
had
told
his
tale
whatever
was
haven
seen
thought
anything
make
smile
since
left
Lothlorien
wasn
funny
that
way
Frodo
was
queer
All
wrong
wasn
dream
And
you
had
best
hear
was
like
this
saw
log
with
eyes
The
log
all
right
said
Frodo
There
are
many
the
River
But
leave
out
the
eyes
That
won
said
Sam
was
the
eyes
made
sit
speak
saw
what
took
log
floating
along
the
half
light
behind
Gimli
boat
but
didn
give
much
heed
Then
seemed
the
log
was
slowly
catching
And
that
was
peculiar
you
might
say
seeing
were
all
floating
the
stream
together
Just
then
saw
the
eyes
two
pale
sort
points
shiny
like
hump
the
near
end
the
log
What
more
wasn
log
for
had
paddle
feet
like
swan
almost
only
they
seemed
bigger
and
kept
dipping
and
out
the
water
That
when
sat
right
and
rubbed
eyes
meaning
give
THE
GREAT
RIVER
383
shout
was
still
there
when
had
rubbed
the
drowse
out
head
For
the
whatever
was
was
coming
along
fast
now
and
getting
close
behind
Gimli
But
whether
those
two
lamps
spotted
moving
and
staring
whether
came
senses
don
know
When
looked
again
wasn
there
Yet
think
caught
glimpse
with
the
tail
eye
the
saying
something
dark
shooting
under
the
shadow
the
bank
couldn
see
more
eyes
though
said
myself
dreaming
again
Sam
Gamgee
said
and
said
more
just
then
But
been
thinking
since
and
now
not
sure
What
you
make
Frodo
should
make
nothing
but
log
and
the
dusk
and
sleep
your
eyes
Sam
said
Frodo
this
was
the
first
time
that
those
eyes
had
been
seen
But
isn
saw
them
away
back
north
before
reached
Lorien
And
saw
strange
creature
with
eyes
climbing
the
flet
that
night
Haldir
saw
too
And
you
remember
the
report
the
Elves
that
went
after
the
orc
band
said
Sam
and
remember
more
too
don
like
thoughts
but
thinking
one
thing
and
another
and
Bilbo
stories
and
all
fancy
could
put
name
the
creature
guess
nasty
name
Gollum
maybe
Yes
that
what
have
feared
for
some
time
said
Frodo
Ever
since
the
night
the
flet
suppose
was
lurking
Moria
and
picked
our
trail
then
but
hoped
that
our
stay
Lorien
would
throw
him
off
the
scent
again
The
miserable
creature
must
have
been
hiding
the
woods
the
Silverlode
watching
start
off
That
about
said
Sam
And
better
bit
more
watchful
ourselves
feel
some
nasty
fingers
round
our
necks
one
these
nights
ever
wake
feel
anything
And
that
what
was
leading
need
trouble
Strider
the
others
tonight
keep
watch
can
sleep
tomorrow
being
more
than
luggage
boat
you
might
say
might
said
Frodo
and
might
say
luggage
with
eyes
You
shall
watch
but
only
you
promise
wake
half
way
towards
morning
nothing
happens
before
then
the
dead
hours
Frodo
came
out
deep
dark
sleep
find
Sam
shaking
him
shame
wake
you
whispered
Sam
but
that
what
you
said
There
nothing
tell
not
much
thought
heard
some
soft
plashing
and
sniffing
noise
while
back
but
you
hear
lot
such
queer
sounds
river
night
lay
down
and
Frodo
sat
huddled
his
blankets
and
fought
off
his
sleep
Minutes
hours
passed
slowly
and
nothing
happened
Frodo
was
just
yielding
the
temptation
lie
down
again
when
dark
shape
hardly
visible
floated
close
one
the
384
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
moored
boats
long
whitish
hand
could
dimly
seen
shot
out
and
grabbed
the
gunwale
two
pale
lamplike
eyes
shone
coldly
they
peered
inside
and
then
they
lifted
and
gazed
Frodo
the
eyot
They
were
not
more
than
yard
two
away
and
Frodo
heard
the
soft
hiss
intaken
breath
stood
drawing
Sting
from
its
sheath
and
faced
the
eyes
Immediately
their
light
was
shut
off
There
was
another
hiss
and
splash
and
the
dark
log
shape
shot
away
downstream
into
the
night
Aragorn
stirred
his
sleep
turned
over
and
sat
What
whispered
springing
and
coming
Frodo
felt
something
sleep
Why
have
you
drawn
your
sword
Gollum
answered
Frodo
least
guess
said
Aragorn
you
know
about
our
little
footpad
you
padded
after
all
through
Moria
and
right
down
Nimrodel
Since
took
boats
has
been
lying
log
and
paddling
with
hands
and
feet
have
tried
catch
him
once
twice
night
but
slier
than
fox
and
slippery
fish
hoped
the
river
voyage
would
beat
him
but
too
clever
waterman
shall
have
try
going
faster
tomorrow
You
lie
down
now
and
will
keep
watch
for
what
left
the
night
wish
could
lay
hands
the
wretch
might
make
him
useful
But
cannot
shall
have
try
and
lose
him
very
dangerous
Quite
apart
from
murder
night
his
own
account
may
put
any
enemy
that
about
our
track
The
night
passed
without
Gollum
showing
much
shadow
again
After
that
the
Company
kept
sharp
look
out
but
they
saw
more
Gollum
while
the
voyage
lasted
was
still
following
was
very
wary
and
cunning
Aragorn
bidding
they
paddled
now
for
long
spells
and
the
banks
went
swiftly
But
they
saw
little
the
country
for
they
journeyed
mostly
night
and
twilight
resting
day
and
lying
hidden
the
land
allowed
this
way
the
time
passed
without
event
until
the
seventh
day
The
weather
was
still
grey
and
overcast
with
wind
from
the
East
but
evening
drew
into
night
the
sky
away
westward
cleared
and
pools
faint
light
yellow
and
pale
green
opened
under
the
grey
shores
cloud
There
the
white
rind
the
new
Moon
could
seen
glimmering
the
remote
lakes
Sam
looked
and
puckered
his
brows
The
next
day
the
country
either
side
began
change
rapidly
The
banks
began
rise
and
grow
stony
Soon
they
were
passing
through
hilly
rocky
land
and
both
shores
there
were
steep
slopes
buried
deep
brakes
thorn
and
sloe
tangled
with
brambles
and
creepers
Behind
them
stood
low
crumbling
cliffs
and
chimneys
THE
GREAT
RIVER
385
grey
weathered
stone
dark
with
ivy
and
beyond
these
again
there
rose
high
ridges
crowned
with
wind
writhen
firs
They
were
drawing
near
the
grey
hill
country
the
Emyn
Muil
the
southern
march
Wilderland
There
were
many
birds
about
the
cliffs
and
the
rock
chimneys
and
all
day
high
the
air
flocks
birds
had
been
circling
black
against
the
pale
sky
they
lay
their
camp
that
day
Aragorn
watched
the
flights
doubtfully
wondering
Gollum
had
been
doing
some
mischief
and
the
news
their
voyage
was
now
moving
the
wilderness
Later
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
Company
was
stir
ring
and
getting
ready
start
again
descried
dark
spot
against
the
fading
light
great
bird
high
and
far
off
now
wheeling
now
flying
slowly
southwards
What
that
Legolas
asked
pointing
the
northern
sky
think
eagle
Yes
said
Legolas
eagle
hunting
eagle
wonder
what
that
forebodes
far
from
the
mountains
will
not
start
until
fully
dark
said
Aragorn
The
eighth
night
their
journey
came
was
silent
and
windless
the
grey
east
wind
had
passed
away
The
thin
crescent
the
Moon
had
fallen
early
into
the
pale
sunset
but
the
sky
was
clear
above
and
though
far
away
the
South
there
were
great
ranges
cloud
that
still
shone
faintly
the
West
stars
glinted
bright
Come
said
Aragorn
will
venture
one
more
journey
night
are
coming
reaches
the
River
that
not
know
well
for
have
never
journeyed
water
these
parts
before
not
between
here
and
the
rapids
Sarn
Gebir
But
right
reckoning
those
are
still
many
miles
ahead
Still
there
are
dangerous
places
even
before
come
there
rocks
and
stony
eyots
the
stream
must
keep
sharp
watch
and
not
try
paddle
swiftly
Sam
the
leading
boat
was
given
the
task
watchman
lay
forward
peering
into
the
gloom
The
night
grew
dark
but
the
stars
above
were
strangely
bright
and
there
was
glimmer
the
face
the
River
was
close
midnight
and
they
had
been
drifting
for
some
while
hardly
using
the
paddles
when
suddenly
Sam
cried
out
Only
few
yards
ahead
dark
shapes
loomed
the
stream
and
heard
the
swirl
racing
water
There
was
swift
current
which
swung
left
towards
the
eastern
shore
where
the
channel
was
clear
they
were
swept
aside
the
travellers
could
see
now
very
close
the
pale
foam
the
River
lashing
against
sharp
rocks
that
were
thrust
out
far
into
the
stream
like
ridge
teeth
The
boats
were
all
huddled
together
Hoy
there
Aragorn
shouted
Boromir
his
boat
bumped
into
386
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
the
leader
This
madness
cannot
dare
the
Rapids
night
But
boat
can
live
Sarn
Gebir
night
day
Back
back
cried
Aragorn
Turn
Turn
you
can
drove
his
paddle
into
the
water
trying
hold
the
boat
and
bring
round
out
reckoning
said
Frodo
did
not
know
that
had
come
far
Anduin
flows
faster
than
thought
Sarn
Gebir
must
close
hand
already
With
great
efforts
they
checked
the
boats
and
slowly
brought
them
about
but
first
they
could
make
only
small
headway
against
the
current
and
all
the
time
they
were
carried
nearer
and
nearer
the
eastern
bank
Now
dark
and
ominous
loomed
the
night
All
together
paddle
shouted
Boromir
Paddle
shall
driven
the
shoals
Even
spoke
Frodo
felt
the
keel
beneath
him
grate
upon
stone
that
moment
there
was
twang
bowstrings
several
arrows
whistled
over
them
and
some
fell
among
them
One
smote
Frodo
between
the
shoulders
and
lurched
forward
with
cry
letting
his
paddle
but
the
arrow
fell
back
foiled
his
hidden
coat
mail
Another
passed
through
Aragorn
hood
and
third
stood
fast
the
gunwale
the
second
boat
close
Merry
hand
Sam
thought
could
glimpse
black
figures
running
and
fro
upon
the
long
shingle
banks
that
lay
under
the
eastern
shore
They
seemed
very
near
Yrch
said
Legolas
falling
into
his
own
tongue
Orcs
cried
Gimli
Gollum
doing
Pll
bound
said
Sam
Frodo
And
nice
place
choose
too
The
River
seems
set
taking
right
into
their
arms
They
all
leaned
forward
straining
the
paddles
even
Sam
took
hand
Every
moment
they
expected
feel
the
bite
black
feathered
arrows
Many
whined
overhead
struck
the
water
nearby
but
there
were
more
hits
was
dark
but
not
too
dark
for
the
night
eyes
Orcs
and
the
star
glimmer
they
must
have
offered
their
cunning
foes
some
mark
unless
was
that
the
grey
cloaks
Lorien
and
the
grey
timber
the
elf
wrought
boats
defeated
the
malice
the
archers
Mordor
Stroke
stroke
they
laboured
the
darkness
was
hard
sure
that
they
were
indeed
moving
all
but
slowly
the
swirl
the
water
grew
less
and
the
shadow
the
eastern
bank
faded
back
into
the
night
last
far
they
could
judge
they
had
reached
the
middle
the
stream
again
and
had
driven
their
boats
back
some
distance
above
the
jutting
rocks
Then
half
turning
they
thrust
them
with
all
their
strength
towards
the
western
shore
Under
the
THE
GREAT
RIVER
387
shadow
bushes
leaning
out
over
the
water
they
halted
and
drew
breath
Legolas
laid
down
his
paddle
and
took
the
bow
that
had
brought
from
Lorien
Then
sprang
ashore
and
climbed
few
paces
the
bank
Stringing
the
bow
and
fitting
arrow
turned
peering
back
over
the
River
into
the
darkness
Across
the
water
there
were
shrill
cries
but
nothing
could
seen
Frodo
looked
the
Elf
standing
tall
above
him
gazed
into
the
night
seeking
mark
shoot
His
head
was
dark
crowned
with
sharp
white
stars
that
glittered
the
black
pools
the
sky
behind
But
now
rising
and
sailing
from
the
South
the
great
clouds
advanced
sending
out
dark
outriders
into
the
starry
fields
sudden
dread
fell
the
Company
Elbereth
Gilthoniel
sighed
Legolas
looked
Even
did
dark
shape
like
cloud
and
yet
not
cloud
for
moved
far
more
swiftly
came
out
the
blackness
the
South
and
sped
towards
the
Company
blotting
out
all
light
approached
Soon
appeared
great
winged
creature
blacker
than
the
pits
the
night
Fierce
voices
rose
greet
from
across
the
water
Frodo
felt
sudden
chill
running
through
him
and
clutching
his
heart
there
was
deadly
cold
like
the
memory
old
wound
his
shoulder
crouched
down
hide
Suddenly
the
great
bow
Lorien
sang
Shrill
went
the
arrow
from
the
elven
string
Frodo
looked
Almost
above
him
the
winged
shape
swerved
There
was
harsh
croaking
scream
fell
out
the
air
vanishing
down
into
the
gloom
the
eastern
shore
The
sky
was
clean
again
There
was
tumult
many
voices
far
away
cursing
and
wailing
the
darkness
and
then
silence
Neither
shaft
nor
cry
came
again
from
the
east
that
night
After
while
Aragorn
led
the
boats
back
upstream
They
felt
their
way
along
the
water
edge
for
some
distance
until
they
found
small
shallow
bay
few
low
trees
grew
there
close
the
water
and
behind
them
rose
steep
rocky
bank
Here
the
Company
decided
stay
and
await
the
dawn
was
useless
attempt
move
further
night
They
made
camp
and
lit
fire
but
lay
huddled
the
boats
moored
close
together
Praised
the
bow
Galadriel
and
the
hand
and
eye
Legolas
said
Gimli
munched
wafer
embas
That
was
mighty
shot
the
dark
friend
But
who
can
say
what
hit
said
Legolas
cannot
said
Gimli
But
glad
that
the
shadow
came
nearer
liked
not
all
Too
much
reminded
the
shadow
Moria
the
shadow
the
Balrog
ended
whisper
388
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
was
not
Balrog
said
Frodo
still
shivering
with
the
chill
that
had
come
upon
him
was
something
colder
think
was
Then
paused
and
fell
silent
What
you
think
asked
Boromir
eagerly
leaning
from
his
boat
was
trying
catch
glimpse
Frodo
face
think
will
not
say
answered
Frodo
Whatever
was
its
fall
has
dismayed
our
enemies
seems
said
Aragorn
Yet
where
they
are
and
how
many
and
what
they
will
next
not
know
This
night
must
all
sleepless
Dark
hides
now
But
what
the
day
will
show
who
can
tell
Have
your
weapons
close
hand
Sam
sat
tapping
the
hilt
his
sword
were
counting
his
fingers
and
looking
the
sky
very
strange
mur
mured
The
Moon
the
same
the
Shire
and
Wilderland
ought
But
either
out
its
running
all
wrong
reckoning
You
remember
Frodo
the
Moon
was
waning
lay
the
flet
that
tree
week
from
the
full
reckon
And
been
week
the
way
last
night
when
pops
New
Moon
thin
nail
paring
had
never
stayed
time
the
Elvish
country
Well
can
remember
three
nights
there
for
certain
and
seem
remember
several
more
but
would
take
oath
was
never
whole
month
Anyone
would
think
that
time
did
not
count
there
And
perhaps
that
was
the
way
said
Frodo
that
land
maybe
were
time
that
has
elsewhere
long
gone
was
not
think
until
Silverlode
bore
back
Anduin
that
returned
the
time
that
flows
through
mortal
lands
the
Great
Sea
And
don
remember
any
moon
either
new
old
Caras
Galadhon
only
stars
night
and
sun
day
Legolas
stirred
his
boat
Nay
time
does
not
tarry
ever
said
but
change
and
growth
not
all
things
and
places
alike
For
the
Elves
the
world
moves
and
moves
both
very
swift
and
very
slow
Swift
because
they
themselves
change
little
and
all
else
fleets
grief
them
Slow
because
they
need
not
count
the
running
years
not
for
themselves
The
passing
seasons
are
but
ripples
ever
repeated
the
long
long
stream
Yet
beneath
the
Sun
all
things
must
wear
end
last
But
the
wearing
slow
Lorien
said
Frodo
The
power
the
Lady
Rich
are
the
hours
though
short
they
seem
Caras
Galadhon
where
Galadriel
wields
the
Elven
ring
That
should
not
have
been
said
outside
Lorien
not
even
said
Aragorn
Speak
more
But
Sam
that
land
you
lost
your
count
There
time
flowed
swiftly
for
the
Elves
THE
GREAT
RIVER
389
The
old
moon
passed
and
new
moon
waxed
and
waned
the
world
outside
while
tarried
there
And
yestereve
new
moon
came
again
Winter
nearly
gone
Time
flows
spring
little
hope
The
night
passed
silently
voice
call
was
heard
again
across
the
water
The
travellers
huddled
their
boats
felt
the
changing
the
weather
The
air
grew
warm
and
very
still
under
the
great
moist
clouds
that
had
floated
from
the
South
and
the
distant
seas
The
rushing
the
River
over
the
rocks
the
rapids
seemed
grow
louder
and
closer
The
twigs
the
trees
above
them
began
drip
When
the
day
came
the
mood
the
world
about
them
had
become
soft
and
sad
Slowly
the
dawn
grew
pale
light
diffused
and
shadowless
There
was
mist
the
River
and
white
fog
swathed
the
shore
the
far
bank
could
not
seen
can
abide
fog
said
Sam
but
this
seems
lucky
one
Now
perhaps
can
get
away
without
those
cursed
goblins
seeing
Perhaps
said
Aragorn
But
will
hard
find
the
path
unless
the
fog
lifts
little
later
And
must
find
the
path
are
pass
Sarn
Gebir
and
come
the
Emyn
Muil
not
see
why
should
pass
the
Rapids
follow
the
River
any
further

Aragorn

that

And
such

than

The

But
the

Boromir
And
even
you

and
come
unmolested
the

what
will
you
then
Leap
down
the
Falls

Aragorn
Say
rather
that
will
bear
our
boats

ancient

and
there
take
the

again

Boromir
held
out
long
against
this
choice

when
became

that

THE

There

The
day
was
now
growing
and
the
fog
had
lifted
little
was
decided
that
Aragorn
and
Legolas
should
once
forward
along
the
shore
while
the
others
remained
the
boats
Aragorn
hoped
find
some
way
which
they
could
carry
both
their
boats
and
their
baggage
the
smoother
water
beyond
the
Rapids
Boats
the
Elves
would
not

None

the
Men

for
even
their

not

where

have
perished
for

boats
used
journey
out
Wilderland
down
Osgiliath
and
still
did
until

years
ago
when
the

Mordor
began
multiply
Seldom
life
has
any

come
out
the
North
and
the
Orcs

said
Boromir
you

peril
will
grow
with
every
mile
even
you
find

Peril
lies
ahead
every
southward
road
answered
Aragorn
Wait
for
one
day
not
return
that
time
you
will
know
that
evil
has
indeed
befallen
Then
you
must
take
new
leader
and
follow
him
best
you
can
was
with
heavy
heart
that
Frodo
saw
Aragorn
and
Legolas
climb
the
steep
bank
and
vanish
into
the
mists
but
his
fears
proved
groundless
Only
two
three
hours
had
passed
and
was
barely
mid
day
when
the
shadowy
shapes
the
explorers
appeared
again
All
well
said
Aragorn
clambered
down
the
bank
There
track
and
leads
good
landing
that
still
serviceable
The
distance
not
great
the
head
the
Rapids
but
half
mile
below
and
they
are
little
more
than
mile
long
Not
far
beyond
them
the
stream
becomes
clear
and
smooth
again
though
runs
swiftly
Our
hardest
task
will
get
our
boats
and
baggage
the
old
portage
way
have
found
but
lies
well
back
from
the
water
side
here
and
runs
under
the
lee
rock
wall
furlong
more
from
the
shore
did
not
find
where
the
northward
landing
lies
still
remains
must
have
passed
yesterday
night
might
labour
far
upstream
and
yet
miss
the
fog
fear
must
leave
the
River
now
and
make
for
the
portage
way
best
can
from
here
THE
GREAT
RIVER
391
That
would
not
easy
even
were
all
Men
said
Boromir
Yet
such
are
will
try
said
Aragorn
Aye
will
said
Gimli
The
legs
Men
will
lag
rough
road
while
Dwarf
goes
the
burden
twice
his
own
weight
Master
Boromir
The
task
proved
hard
indeed
yet
the
end
was
done
The
goods
were
taken
out
the
boats
and
brought
the
top
the
bank
where
there
was
level
space
Then
the
boats
were
drawn
out
the
water
and
carried
They
were
far
less
heavy
than
any
had
expected
what
tree
growing
the
Elvish
country
they
were
made
not
even
Legolas
knew
but
the
wood
was
tough
and
yet
strangely
light
Merry
and
Pippin
alone
could
carry
their
boat
with
ease
along
the
flat
Nonetheless
needed
the
strength
the
two
Men
lift
and
haul
them
over
the
ground
that
the
Company
now
had
cross
sloped
away
from
the
River
tumbled
waste
grey
limestone
boulders
with
many
hidden
holes
shrouded
with
weeds
and
bushes
there
were
thickets
brambles
and
sheer
dells
and
here
and
there
boggy
pools
fed
waters
trickling
from
the
terraces
further
inland
One
one
Boromir
and
Aragorn
carried
the
boats
while
the
others
toiled
and
scrambled
after
them
with
the
baggage
last
all
was
removed
and
laid
the
portage
way
Then
with
little
further
hindrance
save
from
sprawling
briars
and
many
fallen
stones
they
moved
forward
all
together
Fog
still
hung
veils
upon
the
crumbling
rock
wall
and
their
left
mist
shrouded
the
River
they
could
hear
rushing
and
foaming
over
the
sharp
shelves
and
stony
teeth
Sarn
Gebir
but
they
could
not
see
Twice
they
made
the
journey
before
all
was
brought
safe
the
southern
landing
There
the
portage
way
turning
back
the
water
side
ran
gently
down
the
shallow
edge
little
pool
seemed
have
been
scooped
the
river
side
not
hand
but
the
water
swirling
down
from
Sarn
Gebir
against
low
pier
rock
that
jutted
out
some
way
into
the
stream
Beyond
the
shore
rose
sheer
into
grey
cliff
and
there
was
further
passage
for
those
foot
Already
the
short
afternoon
was
past
and
dim
cloudy
dusk
was
closing
They
sat
beside
the
water
listening
the
confused
rush
and
roar
the
Rapids
hidden
the
mist
they
were
tired
and
sleepy
and
their
hearts
were
gloomy
the
dying
day
Well
here
are
and
here
must
pass
another
night

Boromir

sleep
and
even
Aragorn

nodding

Let

Aragorn
Tomorrow
392
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
must
journey
day
again
Unless
the
weather
changes
once
more
and
cheats
shall
have
good
chance
slipping
through
unseen
any
eyes
the
eastern
shore
But
tonight
two
must
watch
together
turns
three
hours
off
and
one
guard
Nothing
happened
that
night
worse
than
brief
drizzle
rain
hour
before
dawn
soon
was
fully
light
they
started
Already
the
fog
was
thinning
They
kept
close
they
could
the
western
side
and
they
could
see
the
dim
shapes
the
low
cliffs
rising
ever
higher
shadowy
walls
with
their
feet
the
hurrying
river
the
mid
morning
the
clouds
drew
down
lower
and
began
rain
heavily
They
drew
the
skin
covers
over
their
boats
prevent
them
from
being
flooded
and
drifted
little
could
seen
before
them
about
them
through
the
grey
falling
curtains
The
rain
however
did
not
last
long
Slowly
the
sky
above
grew
lighter
and
then
suddenly
the
clouds
broke
and
their
draggled
fringes
trailed
away
northward
the
River
The
fogs
and
mists
were
gone
Before
the
travellers
lay
wide
ravine
with
great
rocky
sides
which
clung
upon
shelves
and
narrow
crevices
few
thrawn
trees
The
channel
grew
narrower
and
the
River
swifter
Now
they
were
speeding
along
with
little
hope
stopping
turning
whatever
they
might
meet
ahead
Over
them
was
lane
pale
blue
sky
around
them
the
dark
overshadowed
River
and
before
them
black
shutting
out
the
sun
the
hills
Emyn
Muil
which
opening
could
seen
Frodo
peering
forward
saw
the
distance
two
great
rocks
approaching
like
great
pinnacles
pillars
stone
they
seemed
Tall
and
sheer
and
ominous
they
stood
upon
either
side
the
stream
narrow
gap
appeared
between
them
and
the
River
swept
the
boats
towards
Behold
the
Argonath
the
Pillars
the
Kings
cried
Aragorn
shall
pass
them
soon
Keep
the
boats
line
and
far
apart
you
can
Hold
the
middle
the
stream
Frodo
was
borne
towards
them
the
great
pillars
rose
like
towers
meet
him
Giants
they
seemed
him
vast
grey
figures
silent
but
threatening
Then
saw
that
they
were
indeed
shaped
and
fashioned
the
craft
and
power
old
had
wrought
upon
them
and
still
they
preserved
through
the
suns
and
rains
forgotten
years
the
mighty
likenesses
which
they
had
been
hewn
Upon
great
pedestals
founded
the
deep
waters
stood
two
great
kings
stone
still
with
blurred
eyes
and
crannied
brows
they
frowned
upon
the
North
The
left
hand
each
was
raised
palm
outwards
gesture
warning
each
right
hand
there
was
axe
upon
each
head
there
was
crumb
ling
helm
and
crown
Great
power
and
majesty
they
still
wore
the
silent
wardens
long
vanished
kingdom
Awe
and
fear
fell
upon
THE
GREAT
RIVER
393
Frodo
and
cowered
down
shutting
his
eyes
and
not
daring
look
the
boat
drew
near
Even
Boromir
bowed
his
head
the
boats
whirled
frail
and
fleeting
little
leaves
under
the
enduring
shadow
the
sentinels
Numenor
they
passed
into
the
dark
chasm
the
Gates
Sheer
rose
the
dreadful
cliffs
unguessed
heights
either
side
Far
off
was
the
dim
sky
The
black
waters
roared
and
echoed
and
wind
screamed
over
them
Frodo
crouching
over
his
knees
heard
Sam
front
muttering
and
groaning
What
place
What
horrible
place
Just
let
get
out
this
boat
and
never
wet
toes
puddle
again
let
alone
river
Fear
not
said
strange
voice
behind
him
Frodo
turned
and
saw
Strider
and
yet
not
Strider
for
the
weatherworn
Ranger
was
longer
there
the
stern
sat
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
proud
and
erect
guiding
the
boat
with
skilful
strokes
his
hood
was
cast
back
and
his
dark
hair
was
blowing
the
wind
light
was

returning
from

Then
the
light
his

faded
and
spoke
himself
Would
that
Gandalf
were
here
How
heart
yearns
for
Minas
Anor
and
the
walls
own
city
But
whither
now
shall
The
chasm
was
long
and
dark
and
filled
with
the
noise
wind
and
rushing
water
and
echoing
stone
bent
somewhat
towards
the
west
that
first
all
was
dark
ahead
but
soon
Frodo
saw
tall
gap
light
before
him
ever
growing
Swiftly
drew
near
and
sud
denly
the
boats
shot
through
out
into
wide
clear
light
The
sun
already
long
fallen
from
the
noon
was
shining
windy
sky
The
pent
waters
spread
out
into
long
oval
lake
pale
Nen
Hithoel
fenced
steep
grey
hills
whose
sides
were
clad
with
trees
but
their
heads
were
bare
cold
gleaming
the
sunlight
the
far
southern
end
rose
three
peaks
The
midmost
stood
somewhat
forward
from
the
others
and
sundered
from
them
island
the
waters
about
which
the
flowing
River
flung
pale
shimmering
arms
Distant
but
deep
there
came
the
wind
roaring
sound
like
the
roll
thunder
heard
far
away
Behold
Tol
Brandir
said
Aragorn
pointing
south
the
tall
peak
Upon
the
left
stands
Amon
Lhaw
and
upon
the
right
Amon
Hen
the
Hills
Hearing
and
Sight
the
days
the
great
kings
there
were
high
seats
upon
them
and
watch
was
kept
there
But

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Ere
the
shade
night
falls
shall
come
them
hear
the
endless
voice
Rauros
calling
The
Company
rested
now
for
while
drifting
south
the
current
that
flowed
through
the
middle
the
lake
They
ate
some
food
and
then
they
took
their
paddles
and
hastened
their
way
The
sides
the
westward
hills
fell
into
shadow
and
the
Sun
grew
round
and
red
Here
and
there
misty
star
peered
out
The
three
peaks
loomed
before
them
darkling
the
twilight
Rauros
was
roaring
with
great
voice
Already
night
was
laid
the
flowing
waters
when
the
travellers
came
last
under
the
shadow
the
hills
The
tenth
day
their
journey
was
over
Wilderland
was
behind
them
They
could
further
without
choice
between
the
east
way
and
the
west
The
last
stage
the
Quest
was
before
them
Chapter
THE
BREAKING
THE
FELLOWSHIP
Aragorn
led
them
the
right
arm
the
River
Here
upon
its
western
side
under
the
shadow
Tol
Brandir
green
lawn
ran
down
the
water
from
the
feet
Amon
Hen
Behind
rose
the
first
gentle
slopes
the
hill
clad
with
trees
and
trees
marched
away
westward
along
the
curving
shores
the
lake
little
spring
fell
tumbling
down
and
fed
the
grass
Here
will
rest
tonight
said
Aragorn
This
the
lawn
Parth
Galen
fair
place
the
summer
days
old
Let
hope
that
evil
has
yet
come
here
They
drew
their
boats
the
green
banks
and
beside
them
they
made
their
camp
They
set
watch
but
had
sight
nor
sound
their
enemies
Gollum
had
contrived
follow
them
remained
unseen
and
unheard
Nonetheless
the
night
wore
Aragorn
grew
uneasy
tossing
often
his
sleep
and
waking
the
small
hours
got
and
came
Frodo
whose
turn
was
watch
Why
are
you
waking
asked
Frodo
not
your
watch
not
know
answered
Aragorn
but
shadow
and
threat
has
been
growing
sleep
would
well
draw
your
sword
Why
said
Frodo
Are
enemies
hand
Let
see
what
Sting
may
show
answered
Aragorn
Frodo
then
drew
the
elf
blade
from
its
sheath
his
dismay
the
edges
gleamed
dimly
the
night
Orcs
said
Not
very
near
and
yet
too
near
seems
feared
much
said
Aragorn
But
maybe
they
are
not
this
side
the
River
The
light
Sting
faint
and
may
point
more
than
spies
Mordor
roaming
the
slopes
Amon
Lhaw
have
never
heard
before
Orcs
upon
Amon
Hen
Yet
who
knows
what
may
happen
these
evil
days
now
that
Minas
Tirith
longer
holds
secure
the
passages
Anduin
must
warily
tomorrow
The
day
came
like
fire
and
smoke
Low
the
East
there
were
black
bars
cloud
like
the
fumes
great
burning
The
rising
sun
lit
them
from
beneath
with
flames
murky
red
but
soon
climbed
above
them
into
clear
sky
The
summit
Tol
Brandir
was
tipped
with
gold
Frodo
looked
out
eastward
and
gazed
the
tall
island
Its
sides
sprang
sheer
out
the
running
water
High
above
the
396
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
tall
cliffs
were
steep
slopes
upon
which
trees
climbed
mounting
one
head
above
another
and
above
them
again
were
grey
faces
inaccessible
rock
crowned
great
spire
stone
Many
birds
were
circling
about
but
sign
other
living
things
could
seen
When
they
had
eaten
Aragorn
called
the
Company
together
The
day
has
come
last
said
the
day
choice
which
have
long
delayed
What
shall
now
become
our
Company
that
has
travelled
far
fellowship
Shall
turn
west
with
Boromir
and
the
wars
Gondor
turn
east
the
Fear
and
Shadow
shall
break
our
fellowship
and
this
way
and
that
each
may
choose
Whatever
must
done
soon
cannot
long
halt
here
The
enemy
the
eastern
shore
know
but
fear
that
the
Orcs
may
already
this
side
the
water
There
was
long
silence
which
one
spoke
moved
Well
Frodo
said
Aragorn
last
fear
that
the
burden
laid
upon
you
You
are
the
Bearer
appointed
the
Council
Your
own
way
you
alone
can
choose
this
matter
cannot
advise
you
not
Gandalf
and
though
have
tried
bear
his
part
not
know
what
design
hope
had
for
this
hour
indeed
had
any
Most
likely
seems
that
were
here
now
the
choice
would
still
wait
you
Such
your
fate
Frodo
did
not
answer
once
Then
spoke
slowly
know
that
haste
needed
yet
cannot
choose
The
burden
heavy
Give
hour
longer
and
will
speak
Let
alone
Aragorn
looked
him
with
kindly
pity
Very
well
Frodo
son
Drogo
said
You
shall
have
hour
and
you
shall
alone
will
stay
here
for
while
But
not
stray
far
out
call
Frodo
sat
for
moment
with
his
head
bowed
Sam
who
had
been
watching
his
master
with
great
concern
shook
his
head
and
muttered
Plain
pikestaff
but

Sam
Gamgee
putting
his

just
now
Presently
Frodo
got
and
walked
away
and
Sam
saw
that
while
the
others
restrained
themselves
and
did
not
stare
him
the
eyes
Boromir
followed
Frodo
intently
until
passed
out

the
trees
the

Hen
Wandering
aimlessly
first
the

Frodo
found
that
his
feet
were
leading
him
towards
the
slopes
the

came
path
the
dwindling
ruins
road
long
ago
steep
places
stairs
stone
had
been
hewn
but
now
they
were
cracked
and
worn
and
split
the

trees
For
some
while
climbed
not
caring
which
way
went
until
came
grassy
place
Rowan
trees
grew
about
and
the
midst
was
wide
flat
stone
The
little
upland
lawn
was
open
upon
the
East
and
was
filled
now
with
the

sunlight
Frodo
halted
and
looked
out
over
the
River
far
below
him
Tol
Brandir
and
the
birds
wheeling
the
great
gulf
air
between
him
and
the
untrodden
isle
The
voice
Rauros
was
mighty
roaring
mingled
with
deep
throbbing
boom
sat
down
upon
the
stone
and
cupped
his
chin
his
hands
staring
eastwards
but
seeing
little
with
his
eyes
All
that
had
happened
since
Bilbo
left
the
Shire
was
passing
through
his
mind
and
called
and
pondered
everything
that
could
remember
Gandalf
words
Time
went
and
still
was
nearer
choice
Suddenly
awoke
from
his
thoughts
strange
feeling
came
him
that
something
was
behind
him
that
unfriendly
eyes
were
upon
him
sprang
and
turned
but
all
that
saw
his
surprise
was
Boromir
and
his
face
was
smiling
and
kind
was
afraid
for
you
Frodo
said
coming
forward
Aragorn
right
and
Orcs
are
near
then
none
should
wander
alone
and
you
least
all
much
depends
you
And
heart
too
heavy
May
stay
now
and
talk
for
while
since
have
found
you
would
comfort
Where
there
are
many
all
speech
becomes
debate
without
end
But
two
together
may
perhaps
find
wisdom
You
are
kind
answered
Frodo
But
not
think
that
any
speech
will
help
For
know
what
should
but
afraid
doing
Boromir
afraid
Boromir
stood
silent
Rauros
roared
endlessly
The
wind
mur
mured
the
branches
the
trees
Frodo
shivered
Suddenly
Boromir
came
and
sat
beside
him
Are
you
sure
that
you
not
suffer
needlessly
said
wish
help
you
You
need
counsel
your
hard
choice
Will
you
not
take
mine
think
know
already
what
counsel
you
would
give
Boromir
said
Frodo
And
would
seem
like
wisdom
but
for
the
warning
heart
Warning
Warning
against
what
said
Boromir
sharply
Against
delay
Against
the
way
that
seems
easier
Against
refusal
the
burden
that
laid
Against
well
must
said
against
trust
the
strength
and
truth
Men
Yet
that
strength
has
long
protected
you
far
away
your
little
country
though
you
knew
not
not
doubt
the
valour
your
people
But
the
world
chang
ing
The
walls
Minas
Tirith
may
strong
but
they
are
not
strong
enough
they
fail
what
then
shall
fall
battle
valiantly
Yet
there
still
hope
that
they
will
not
fail
hope
while
the
Ring
lasts
said
Frodo
The
Ring
said
Boromir
his
eyes
lighting
The
Ring
not
strange
fate
that
should
suffer
much
fear
and
doubt
for

small

small

And
have
seen
only
for
instant
the

Elrond
Could
not
have
sight
again
Frodo
looked
His
heart
went
suddenly
cold
caught
the
strange
gleam
Boromir
eyes
yet
his
face
was
still
kind
and
friendly
best
that
should
lie
hidden
answered
you
wish
care
not
said
Boromir
Yet
may
not
even
speak
For
you
seem
ever
think
only
its
power
the
hands
the
Enemy
its
evil
uses
not
its
good
The
world
changing
you
say
Minas
Tirith
will
fall
the
Ring
lasts
But
why
Certainly
the
Ring
were
with
the
Enemy
But
why
were
with
Were
you
not
the
Council
answered
Frodo
Because
cannot
use
and
what
done
with
turns
evil
Boromir
got
and
walked
about
impatiently
you
cried
Gandalf
Elrond
all
these
folk
have
taught
you
say
For
themselves
they
may
right
These
elves
and
half
elves
and
wizards
they
would
come
grief
perhaps
Yet
often
doubt
they
are
wise
and
not
merely
timid
But
each
his
own
kind
True
hearted
Men
they
will
not
corrupted
Minas

have
been
staunch
through
long
years

not
desire
the

only

And
behold
our
need

Power

say
gift
the
foes
Mordor
mad
not

use
the
power
the
Enemy
against
him
The
fearless
the
ruthless
these
alone
will
achieve
victory
What
could
not
warrior
this
hour
great
leader
What
could
not
Aragorn
refuses
why
not
Boromir
The
Ring
would
give
power
Command
How
would
drive
the
hosts
Mordor
and
all
men
would
flock
banner
Boromir
strode
and
down
speaking
ever
more
loudly
Almost
seemed
have
forgotten
Frodo
while
his
talk
dwelt
walls
and
weapons
and
the
mustering
men
and
drew
plans
for
great
alliances
and
glorious
victories
and
cast
down
Mordor
and
became
himself
mighty
king
benevolent
and
wise
Suddenly
stopped
and
waved
his
arms
And
they
tell
throw
away
cried
not
say
destroy
That
might
well
reason
could
show
any
hope
doing
does
not
The
only
plan
that
proposed
that
halfling
should
walk
blindly
into
Mordor
and
offer
the
Enemy
every
chance
recapturing
for
himself
Folly
Surely
you
see
friend
said
turning
now
suddenly
Frodo
again
You
say
that
you
are
afraid
the
boldest
should
pardon
you
But
not
really
your
good
sense
that
revolts
afraid
said
Frodo
Simply
afraid
But
glad
have
heard
you
speak
fully
mind
clearer
now
THE
BREAKING
THE
FELLOWSHIP
399
Then
you
will
come
Minas
Tirith
cried
Boromir
His
eyes
were
shining
and
his
face
eager
You
misunderstand
said
Frodo
But
you
will
come
least
for
while
Boromir
persisted
city
not
far
now
and
little
further
from
there
Mordor
than
from
here
have
been
long
the
wilderness
and
you
need
news
what
the
Enemy
doing
before
you
make
move
Come
with
Frodo
said
You
need
rest
before
your
venture
you
must
laid
his
hand
the
hobbit
shoulder
friendly
fashion
but
Frodo
felt
the
hand
trembling
with
suppressed
excitement
stepped
quickly
away
and
eyed
with
alarm
the
tall
Man
nearly
twice
his
height
and
many
times
his
match
strength
Why
are
you
unfriendly
said
Boromir
true
man
neither
thief
nor
tracker
need
your
Ring
that
you
know
now
but
give
you
word
that
not
desire
keep
Will
you
not
least
let
make
trial
plan
Lend
the
Ring
cried
Frodo
The
Council
laid
upon
bear
our
own
folly
that
the
Enemy
will
defeat
cried
Boromir
How
angers
Fool
Obstinate
fool
Running
wilfully
death
and
ruining
our
cause
any
mortals
have
claim
the
Ring
the
men
Numenor
and
not
Halflings
not
yours
save
unhappy
chance
might
have
been
mine
should
mine
Give
Frodo
did
not
answer
but
moved
away
till
the
great
flat
stone
stood
between
them
Come
come
friend
said
Boromir
softer
voice
Why
not
get
rid
Why
not
free
your
doubt
and
fear
You
can
lay
the
blame
you
will
You
can
say
that
was
too
strong
and
took
force
For
too
strong
for
you
halfling
cried
and
suddenly
sprang
over
the
stone
and
leaped
Frodo
His
fair
and
pleasant
face
was
hideously
changed
raging
fire
was
his
eyes
Frodo
dodged
aside
and
again
put
the
stone
between
them
There
was
only
one
thing
could
trembling
pulled
out
the
Ring
upon
its
chain
and
quickly
slipped
his
finger
even
Boromir
sprang
him
again
The
Man
gasped
stared
for
moment
amazed
and
then
ran
wildly
about
seeking
here
and
there
among
the
rocks
and
trees
Miserable
trickster
shouted
Let
get
hands
you
Now
see
your
mind
You
will
take
the
Ring
Sauron
and
sell
all
You
have
only
waited
your
chance
leave
the
lurch
Curse
you
and
all
halflings
death
and
darkness
Then
catching
his
foot
stone
fell
sprawling
and
lay
upon
his
face
For
while
was
still
his
own
curse
had
struck
him
down
then
suddenly
wept
400
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
rose
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
dashing
away
the
tears
What
have
said
cried
What
have
done
Frodo
Frodo
called
Come
back
madness
took
but
has
passed
Come
back
There
was
answer
Frodo
did
not
even
hear
his
cries
was
already
far
away
leaping
blindly
the
path
the
hill
top
Terror
and
grief
shook
him
seeing
his
thought
the
mad
fierce
face
Boromir
and
his
burning
eyes
Soon
came
out
alone
the
summit
Amon
Hen
and
halted
gasping
for
breath
saw
through
mist
wide
flat
circle
paved
with
mighty
flags
and
surrounded
with
crumbling
battlement
and
the
middle
set
upon
four
carven
pillars
was
high
seat
reached
stair
many
steps
went
and
sat
upon
the
ancient
chair
feeling
like
lost
child
that
had
clambered
upon
the
throne
mountain
kings
first
could
see
little
seemed
world
mist
which
there
were
only
shadows
the
Ring
was
upon
him
Then
here
and
there
the
mist
gave
way
and
saw
many
visions
small
and
clear
they
were
under
his
eyes
upon
table
and
yet
remote
There
was
sound
only
bright
living
images
The
world
seemed
have
shrunk
and
fallen
silent
was
sitting
upon
the
Seat
Seeing
Amon
Hen
the
Hill
the
Eye
the
Men
Numenor
Eastward
looked
into
wide
uncharted
lands
nameless
plains
and
forests
unexplored
Northward
looked
and
the
Great
River
lay
like
ribbon
beneath
him
and
the
Misty
Mountains
stood
small
and
hard
broken
teeth
Westward
looked
and
saw
the
broad
pastures
Rohan
and
Orthanc
the
pinnacle
Isengard
like
black
spike
Southward
looked
and
below
his
very
feet
the
Great
River
curled
like
toppling
wave
and
plunged
over
the
falls
Rauros
into
foaming
pit
glimmering
rainbow
played
upon
the
fume
And
Ethir
Anduin
saw
the
mighty
delta
the
River
and
myriads
sea
birds
whirling
like
white
dust
the
sun
and
beneath
them
green
and
silver
sea
rippling
endless
lines
But
everywhere
looked
saw
the
signs
war
The
Misty
Mountains
were
crawling
like
anthills
orcs
were
issuing
out
thousand
holes
Under
the
boughs
Mirkwood
there
was
deadly
strife
Elves
and
Men
and
fell
beasts
The
land
the
Beornings
was
aflame
cloud
was
over
Moria
smoke
rose
the
borders
Lorien
Horsemen
were
galloping
the
grass
Rohan
wolves
poured
from
Isengard
From
the
havens
Harad
ships
war
put
out
sea
and
out
the
East
Men
were
moving
endlessly
swordsmen
spearmen
bowmen
upon
horses
chariots
chieftains
and
laden
THE

401
wains
All
the
power
the
Dark
Lord
was
motion
Then
turning
south
again
beheld
Minas
Tirith
Far
away
seemed
and
beauti
ful
white
walled
many
towered
proud
and
fair
upon
its
mountain
seat
its
battlements
glittered
with
steel
and
its
turrets
were
bright
with
many
banners
Hope
leaped
his
heart
But
against
Minas
Tirith
was
set
another
fortress
greater
and
more
strong
Thither
eastward
unwilling
his
eye
was
drawn
passed
the
ruined
bridges
Osgiliath
the
grinning
gates
Minas
Morgul
and
the
haunted
Mountains
and
looked
upon
Gorgoroth
the
valley
terror
the
Land
Mordor
Darkness
lay
there
under
the
Sun
Fire
glowed
amid
the
smoke
Mount
Doom
was
burning
and
great
reek
rising
Then
last
his
gaze
was
held
wall
upon
wall
battlement
upon
battlement
black
immeasurably
strong
mountain
iron
gate
steel
tower
adamant
saw
Barad
dtir
Fortress
Sauron
All
hope
left
him
And
suddenly
felt
the
Eye
There
was
eye
the
Dark
Tower
that
did
not
sleep
knew
that
had
become
aware
his
gaze
fierce
eager
will
was
there
leaped
towards
him
almost
like
finger
felt
searching
for
him
Very
soon
would
nail
him
down
know
just
exactly
where
was
Amon
Lhaw
touched
glanced
upon
Tol
Brandir
threw
himself
from
the
seat
crouching
covering
his
head
with
his
grey
hood
heard
himself
crying
out
Never
never
was
Verily
come
come
you
could
not
tell
Then
flash
from
some
other
point
power
there
came
his
mind
another
thought
Take
off
Take
off
Fool
take
off
Take
off
the
Ring
The
two
powers
strove
him
For
moment
perfectly
balanced
between
their
piercing
points
writhed
tormented
Suddenly
was
aware
himself
again
Frodo
neither
the
Voice
nor
the
Eye
free
choose
and
with
one
remaining
instant
which
took
the
Ring
off
his
finger
was
kneeling
clear
sunlight
before
the
high
seat
black
shadow
seemed
pass
like
arm
above
him
missed
Amon
Hen
and
groped
out
west
and
faded
Then
all
the
sky
was
clean
and
blue
and
birds
sang
every
tree
Frodo
rose
his
feet
great
weariness
was
him
but
his
will
was
firm
and
his
heart
lighter
spoke
aloud
himself
will
now
what
must
said
This
least
plain
the
evil
the
Ring
already
work
even
the
Company
and
the
Ring
must
leave
them
before
does
more
harm
will
alone
Some
cannot
trust
and
those
can
trust
are
too
dear
poor
old
Sam
and
Merry
and
Pippin
Strider
too
his
heart
yearns
for
Minas
Tirith
and
will
needed
there
now
Boromir
has
fallen
into
evil
will
alone
once
went
quickly
down
the
path
and
came
back
the
lawn
where
402
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Boromir
had
found
him
Then
halted
listening
thought
could
hear
cries
and
calls
from
the
woods
near
the
shore
below
They
hunting
for
said
wonder
how
long
have
been
away
Hours
should
think
hesitated
What
can
muttered
must
now
shall
never
shan
get
chance
again
hate
leaving
them
and
like
this
without
any
explanation
But
surely
they
will
understand
Sam
will
And
what
else
can
Slowly
drew
out
the
Ring
and
put
once
more
vanished
and
passed
down
the
hill
less
than
rustle
the
wind
The
others
remained
long
the
river
side
For
some
time
they
had
been
silent
moving
restlessly
about
but
now
they
were
sitting
circle
and
they
were
talking
Every
now
and
again
they
made
efforts
speak
other
things
their
long
road
and
many
adven
tures
they
questioned
Aragorn
concerning
the
realm
Gondor
and
its
ancient
history
and
the
remnants
its
great
works
that
could
still
seen
this
strange
border
land
the
Emyn
Muil
the
stone
kings
and
the
seats
Lhaw
and
Hen
and
the
great
Stair
beside
the
falls
Rauros
But
always
their
thoughts
and
words
strayed
back
Frodo
and
the
Ring
What
would
Frodo
choose
Why
was
hesitating
debating
which
course
the
most
desperate
think
said
Aragorn
And
well
may
now
more
hopeless
than
ever
for
the
Company
east
since
have
been
tracked
Gollum
and
must
fear
that
the
secret
our
journey
already
betrayed
But
Minas
Tirith
nearer
the
Fire
and
the
destruction
the
Burden
may
remain
there
for
while
and
make
brave
stand
but
the
Lord
Denethor
and
all
his
men
cannot
hope
what
even
Elrond
said
was
beyond
his
power
either
keep
the
Burden
secret
hold
off
the
full
might
the
Enemy
when
comes
take
Which
way
would
any
choose
Frodo
place
not
know
Now
indeed
miss
Gandalf
most
Grievous
our
loss
said
Legolas
Yet
must
needs
make
our
minds
without
his
aid
Why
cannot
decide
and
help
Frodo
Let
call
him
back
and
then
vote
should
vote
for
Minas
Tirith
And
should
said
Gimli
course
were
only
sent
help
the
Bearer
along
the
road
further
than
wished
and
none
under
any
oath
command
seek
Mount
Doom
Hard
was
parting
from
Lothlorien
Yet
have
come
far
and
say
this
now
have
reached
the
last
choice
clear
that
cannot
leave
Frodo
would
choose
Minas
Tirith
but
does
not
then
follow
him
And
too
will
with
him
said
Legolas
would
faithless
now
say
farewell
THE

403
would
indeed
betrayal
all
left
him
said
Aragorn
But
goes
east
then
all
need
not
with
him
nor
think
that
all
should
That
venture
desperate
much
for
eight
for
three
two
one
alone
you
would
let
choose
then
should
appoint
three
companions
Sam
who
could
not
bear
other
wise
and
Gimli
and
myself
Boromir
will
return
his
own
city
where
his
father
and
his
people
need
him
and
with
him

said
Pippin
This

horrible
Surely
the

Yes
said
Aragorn
The
hour
long
passed
The
morning
wearing
away
must
call
for
him
that
moment
Boromir
reappeared
came
out
from
the
trees
and
walked
towards
them
without
speaking
His
face
looked
grim
and
sad
paused
counting
those
that
were
present
and
then
sat
down
aloof
with
his
eyes
the
ground
Where
have
you
been
Boromir
asked
Aragorn
Have
you
seen
Frodo
Boromir
hesitated
for
second
Yes
and
answered
slowly
Yes
found
him
some

the

and
spoke

urged
him

would
return

that
all
that

said
Aragorn
looking
hard
and
not
too
kindly
Boromir
Yes
answered

say
more
yet
This

Sam

Why

How

Half

for

They

Sam

Merry

Aragorn
Boromir
not
know
what
part
you
have
played
this
mischief
but
help
now
after
those
two
young
hobbits
and
guard
them
the

even
you

Frodo
Come
back
this
spot

him
any

return
soon
Aragorn
sprang
swiftly
away
and
went
pursuit
Sam
Just
reached
the
little
lawn
among
the
rowans
overtook
him
toiling
uphill
panting
and
calling
Frodo
Come

None

Follow

open
sped
the
path
Sam
did
his
best
but
could
not
keep
with
Strider
the
Ranger
and
soon
fell
behind
had
not
gone
far
before
Aragorn
was
out
sight
ahead
Sam
stopped
and
puffed
Suddenly
clapped
his
hand
his
head
Whoa
Sam
Gamgee
said
aloud
Your
legs
are
too
short
use
your
head
Let
see
now
Boromir
isn
lying
that
not
his
way
but
hasn
told
everything
Something
scared
Frodo
badly
screwed
himself
the
point
sudden
made
his
mind
last
Where
Off
East
Not
without
Sam
Yes
without
even
his
Sam
That
hard
cruel
hard
Sam
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
brushing
away
the
tears
Steady
Gamgee
said
Think

Back

Back

Sam
turned
and
bolted

and
cut

and
ran

Parth
Galen
the
shore
where
the

were
drawn
out
the
water
one
was
there
There
seemed
cries
the
woods
behind
but
did
not
heed
them
stood
gazing
for
moment
stock
still
gaping
boat
was
sliding
down
the
bank
all
itself
With
shout
Sam
raced
across
the
grass
The
boat
slipped
into
the
water
Coming
Frodo
Coming
called
Sam
and
flung
himself
from
the
bank
clutching
the
departing
boat
missed
yard
With
cry
and
splash
fell
face
downward
into
deep
swift
water
Gurgling
went
under
and
the
River
closed
over
his
curly
head
exclamation
dismay
came
from
the
empty
boat
paddle
swirled
and
the

put

THE

Fear

Sam

you
Tread

you
upset
the

There
now
get
hold
the
side
and
let
use
the
paddle
With
few
strokes
Frodo
brought
the
boat
back
the
bank
and
Sam
was
able
scramble
out
wet
water
rat
Frodo
took
off
the
Ring
and
stepped
ashore
again
all
the
confounded
nuisances
you
are
the
worst
Sam
said
Frodo
that
hard
said
Sam
shivering
That
hard
trying
without
and
all
hadn
guessed
right
where
would
you
now
Safely
way
Safely
said
Sam
All
alone
and
without
help
you
couldn
have
borne
have
been
the
death
would
the
death
you
come
with
Sam
said
Frodo
and
could
not
have
borne
that
Not
certain
being
left
behind
said
Sam
But
going
Mordor
know
that
well
enough
Frodo
course
you
are
And
coming
with
you
Now
Sam
said
Frodo
don
hinder
The
others
will
coming
back
any
minute
they
catch
here
shall
have
argue
and
explain
and
shall
never
have
the
heart
the
chance
get
off
But
must
once
the
only
way
course
answered
Sam
But
not
alone
coming
too
neither
isn
going
Ill
knock
holes
all
the
boats
first
Frodo
actually
laughed
sudden
warmth
and
gladness
touched
his
heart
Leave
one
said
need
But
you
can
come
like
this
without
your
gear
food
anything
Just
hold
moment
and
get
stuff
cried
Sam
eagerly
all
ready
thought
should
off
today
rushed
the
camping
place
fished
out
his
pack
from
the
pile
where
Frodo
had
laid
when
emptied
the
boat
his
companions
goods
grabbed
spare
blanket
and
some
extra
packages
food
and
ran
back
all
plan
spoilt
said
Frodo
good
trying
escape
you
But
glad
Sam
cannot
tell
you
how
glad
Come
along
plain
that
were
meant
together
will
and
may
the

find

Strider

Yet

407
Frodo
and
Sam
set
off
the
last
stage
the
Quest
together
Frodo
paddled
away
from
the
shore
and
the
River
bore
them
swiftly
away
down
the
western
arm
and
past
the
frowning
cliffs
Tol
Brandir
The
roar
the
great
falls
drew
nearer
Even
with
such
help
Sam
could
give
was
hard
work
pass
across
the
current
the
southward
end
the
island
and
drive
the
boat
eastward
towards
the
far
shore
length
they
came
land
again
upon
the
southern
slopes
Amon
Lhaw
There
they
found
shelving
shore
and
they
drew
the
boat
out
high
above
the
water
and
hid
well
they
could
behind
great
boulder
Then
shouldering
their
burdens
they
set
off
seeking
path
that
would
bring
them
over
the
grey
hills
the
Emyn
Muil
and
down
into
the
Land

THE

BOROMIR
Aragorn
sped
the
hill
Every
now
and
again
bent
the
ground
Hobbits
light
and
their
footprints
are
not
easy
even
for
Ranger
read
but
not
far
from
the
top
spring
crossed
the
path
and
the
wet
earth
saw
what
was
seeking
read
the
signs
aright
said
himself
Frodo
ran
the
hill
top
wonder
what
saw
there
But
returned
the
same
way
and
went
down
the
hill
again
Aragorn
hesitated
desired
the
high
seat
himself
hoping
see
there
something
that
would
guide
him
his
per
plexities
but
time
was
pressing
Suddenly
leaped
forward
and
ran
the
summit
across
the
great
flag
stones
and
the
steps
Then
sitting
the
high
seat
looked
out
But
the
sun
seemed
darkened
and
the
world
dim
and
remote
turned
from
the
North
back
again
North
and
saw
nothing
save
the
distant
hills
unless
were
that
far
away
could
see
again
great
bird
like
eagle
high
the
air
descending
slowly
wide
circles
down
towards
the
earth
Even
gazed
his
quick
ears
caught
sounds
the
woodlands
below
the
west
side
the
River
stiffened
There
were
cries
and
among
them
his
horror
could
distinguish
the
harsh
voices
Orcs
Then
suddenly
with
deep
throated
call
great
horn
blew
and
the
blasts
smote
the
hills
and
echoed
the
hollows
rising
mighty
shout
above
the
roaring
the
falls
The
horn
Boromir
cried
need
sprang
down
the
steps
and
away
leaping
down
the
path
Alas
ill
fate
this
day
and
all
that
goes
amiss
Where
Sam
ran
the
cries
came
louder
but
fainter
now
and
desperately
the
horn
was
blowing
Fierce
and
shrill
rose
the
yells
the
Orcs
and
suddenly
the
horn
calls
ceased
Aragorn
raced
down
the
last
slope
but
before
could
reach
the
hill
foot
the
sounds
died
away
and
turned
the
left
and
ran
towards
them
they
retreated
until
last
could
hear
them
more
Drawing
his
bright
sword
and
crying

from

Boromir
was
sitting
with
his
back
great
tree
was
resting
But
Aragorn
saw
that
was
pierced
with
many
black
feathered
arrows
his
sword
was
still
his
hand
but
was

THE

broken
near
the
hilt
his
horn
cloven
two
was
his
side
Many
Orcs
lay
slain
piled
all
about
him
and
his
feet
Aragorn
knelt
beside
him
Boromir
opened
his
eyes
and
strove
speak
last
slow
words
came
tried
take
the
Ring
from
Frodo
said
sorry
have
paid
His
glance
strayed
his
fallen
enemies

there
They
have
gone

Halflings
the
Orcs
have
taken
them

they
are

Orcs

them
paused
and
his
eyes
closed
wearily
After
moment
spoke
again
Farewell
Aragorn
Minas
Tirith
and
save
people
have
failed
said
Aragorn
taking
his
hand
and
kissing
his
brow
You
have
conquered
Few
have
gained
such
victory
peace
Minas
Tirith
shall
not
fall
Boromir
smiled
Which
way
did
they
Was
Frodo
there
said
Aragorn
But
Boromir
did
not
speak
again
Alas
said
Aragorn
Thus
passes
the
heir
Denethor
Lord
the
Tower
Guard
This
bitter
end
Now
the
Company
all
ruin
that
have
failed
Vain
was
Gandalf

What
shall
now
Boromir
has
laid
Minas
Tirith
and
heart
desires
but
where
are
the
Ring
and
the
Bearer
How
shall
find
them
and
save
the
Quest
from
disaster
knelt
for
while
bent
with
weeping
still
clasping
Boromir
hand
was
that
Legolas
and
Gimli
found
him
They
came
from
the
western
slopes
the
hill
silently
creeping
through
the
trees
they
were
hunting
Gimli
had
his
axe
hand
and
Legolas
his
long
knife
all
his
arrows
were
spent
When
they
came
into
the
glade
they
halted
amazement
and
then
they
stood
moment
with
heads
bowed
grief
for
seemed
them
plain
what
had
happened
Alas
said
Legolas
coming
Aragorn
side
have
hunted
and
slain
many
Orcs
the
woods
but
should
have
been
more
use
here
came
when
heard
the
horn
but
too
late
seems
fear
you
have
taken
deadly
hurt
Boromir
dead
said
Aragorn
unscathed
for
was
not
here
with
him
fell
defending
the
hobbits
while
was
away
upon
the
hill
The
hobbits
cried
Gimli
Where
are
they
then
Where
Frodo
not
know
answered
Aragorn
wearily
Before
died
Boromir
told
that
the
Orcs
had
bound
them
did
not
think
that
they
were
dead
sent
him
follow
Merry
and
Pippin
but
did
not
ask
him
Frodo
Sam
were
with
him
not
until
was
too
late
All
that
have
done
today
has
gone
amiss
What
done
now
First
must
tend
the
fallen
said
Legolas
cannot
leave
him
lying
like
carrion
among
these
foul
Orcs
THE
DEPARTURE
BOROMIR
AIS
But
must
swift
said
Gimli
would
not
wish
linger
must
follow
the
Orcs
there
hope
that
any
our
Company
are
living
prisoners
But
not
know
whether
the
Ring
bearer
with
them
not
said
Aragorn
Are
abandon
him
Must
not
seek
him
first
evil
choice
now
before
Then
let
first
what
must
said
Legolas
have
not
the
time
the
tools
bury
our
comrade
fitly
raise
mound
over
him
cairn
might
build
The
labour
would
hard
and
long
there
are
stones
that
could
use
nearer
than
the
water
side
said
Gimli
Then
let
lay
him
boat
with
his
weapons
and
the
weapons
his
vanquished
foes
said
Aragorn
will
send
him
the
Falls
Rauros
and
give
him
Anduin
The
River
Gondor
will
take
care
least
that
evil
creature
dishonours
his
bones
Quickly
they
searched
the
bodies
the
Orcs
gathering
their
swords
and
cloven
helms
and
shields
into
heap
See
cried
Aragorn
Here
find
tokens
picked
out
from
the
pile
grim
weapons
two
knives
leaf
bladed
damasked
gold
and
red
and
searching
further
found
also
the
sheaths
black
set
with
small
red
gems
orc
tools
these
said
They
were
borne
the
hobbits
Doubtless
the
Orcs
despoiled
them
but
feared
keep
the
knives
knowing
them
for
what
they
are
work
Wester
nesse
wound
about
with
spells
for
the
bane
Mordor
Well
now
they
still
live
our
friends
are
weaponless
will
take
these
things
hoping
against
hope
give
them
back
And
said
Legolas
will
take
all
the
arrows
that
can
find
for
quiver
empty
searched
the
pile
and
the
ground
about
and
found
not
few
that
were
undamaged
and
longer
the
shaft
than
such
arrows
the
Orcs
were
accustomed
use
looked
them
closely
And
Aragorn
looked
the
slain
and
said
Here
lie
many
that
are
not
folk
Mordor
Some
are
from
the
North
from
the
Misty
Mountains
know
anything
Orcs
and
their
kinds
And
here
are
others
strange
Their
gear
not
after
the
manner
Orcs
all
There
were
four
goblin
soldiers
greater
stature
swart
slant
eyed
with
thick
legs
and
large
hands
They
were
armed
with

THE
LORD
THE

have
not
seen
these
tokens
before
said
Aragorn
What
they
mean
for
Sauron
said
Gimli
That
easy
read
Nay
said
Legolas
Sauron
does
not
use
the
elf
runes
Neither
does
use
his
right
name
nor
permit
spelt
spoken
said
Aragorn
And
does
not
use

The

There

Isengard
and

Gandalf
feared
some

the

Saruman
has
had
news
our

likely
too
that

Pursuers
from

may
have
escaped
the
vigilance
Lorien
they
may
have
avoided
that
land
and
come
Isengard
other
paths
Orcs
travel
fast
But
Saruman
has
many
ways
learning
news
you
remember
the
birds
Well
have
time
ponder
riddles
said
Gimli
Let
bear
Boromir
away
But
after
that
must
guess
the
riddles
are
choose
our
course
rightly
answered
Aragorn
Maybe
there
right
choice
said
Gimli
Taking
his
axe
the
Dwarf
now
cut
several
branches
These
they
lashed
together
with
bowstrings
and
spread
their
cloaks
upon
the
frame
Upon
this
rough
bier
they
carried
the
body
their
companion
the
shore
together
with
such
trophies
his
last
battle
they
chose
send
forth
with
him
was
only
short
way
yet
they
found
easy
task
for
Boromir
was
man
both
tall
and
strong
the
water
side
Aragorn
remained
watching
the
bier
while
Legolas
and
Gimli
hastened
back
foot
Parth
Galen
was
mile
more
and
was
some
time
before
they
came
back
paddling
two
boats
swiftly
along
the
shore
There
strange
tale
tell
said
Legolas
There
are
only
two
boats
upon
the
bank
could
find
trace
the
other
Have
Orcs
been
there
asked
Aragorn
saw
signs
them
answered
Gimli
And
Orcs
would
have
taken
destroyed
all
the
boats
and
the
baggage
well
will
look
the
ground
when
come
there
said
Aragorn
Now
they
laid
Boromir
the
middle
the
boat
that
was
bear
him
away
The
grey
hood
and
elven
cloak
they
folded
and
placed
beneath
his
head
They
combed
his
long
dark
hair
and
arrayed
upon
his
shoulders
The
golden
belt
Lorien
gleamed
about
his
waist
His
helm
they
set
beside
him
and
across
his
lap
they
laid
the
cloven
horn
and
the
hilt
and
shards
his
sword
beneath
his
feet
THE
DEPARTURE
BOROMIR
417
they
put
the
swords
his
enemies
Then
fastening
the
prow
the
stern
the
other
boat
they
drew
him
out
into
the
water
They
rowed
sadly
along
the
shore
and
turning
into
the
swift
running
channel
they
passed
the
green
sward
Parth
Galen
The
steep
sides
Tol
Brandir
were
glowing
was
now
mid
afternoon
they
went
south
the
fume
Rauros
rose
and
shimmered
before
them
haze
gold
The
rush
and
thunder
the
falls
shook
the
windless
air
Sorrowfully
they
cast
loose
the
funeral
boat
there
Boromir
lay
restful
peaceful
gliding
upon
the
bosom
the
flowing
water
The
stream
took
him
while
they
held
their
own
boat
back
with
their
paddles
floated
them
and
slowly
his
boat
departed
waning
dark
spot
against
the
golden
light
and
then
suddenly
vanished
Rauros
roared
unchanging
The
River
had
taken
Boromir
son
Denethor
and
was
not
seen
again
Minas
Tirith
standing
used
stand
upon
the
White
Tower
the
morning
But
Gondor
after
days
long
was
said
that
the
elven
boat
rode
the
falls
and
the
foaming
pool
and
bore
him
down
through
Osgiliath
and
past
the
many
mouths
Anduin
out
into
the
Great
Sea
night
under
the
stars
For
while
the
three
companions
remained
silent
gazing
after
him
Then
Aragorn
spoke
They
will
look
for
him
from
the
White
Tower
said
but
will
not
return
from
mountain
from
sea
Then
slowly
began
sing
Through
Rohan
over
fen
and
field
where
the
long
grass
grows
The
West
Wind
comes
walking
and
about
the
walls
goes
What
news
from
the
West
wandering
wind
you
bring
tonight
Have
you
seen
Boromir
the
Tall
moon
starlight
saw
him
ride
over
seven
streams
over
waters
wide
and
grey
saw
him
walk
empty
lands
until
passed
away
Into
the
shadows
the
North
saw
him
then
more
The
North
Wind
may
have
heard
the
horn
the
son
Denethor
Boromir
From
the
high
walls
westward
looked
afar
But
you
came
not
from
the
empty
lands
where
men
are
Then
Legolas
sang
From
the
mouths
the
Sea
the
South
Wind
flies
from
the
sandhills
and
the
stones
The
wailing
the
gulls
bears
and
the
gate
moans
418
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
What
news
from
the
South
sighing
wind
you
bring
eve
Where
now
Boromir
the
Fair
tarries
and
grieve
Ask
not
where
doth
dwell
many
bones
there
lie
the
white
shores
and
the
dark
shores
under
the
stormy
sky
many
have
passed
down
Anduin
find
the
flowing
Sea
Ask
the
North
Wind
news
them
the
North
Wind
sends
Boromir
Beyond
the
gate
the
seaward
road
runs
south
But
you
came
not
with
the
wailing
gulls
from
the
grey
sea
mouth
Then
Aragorn
sang
again
From
the
Gate
Kings
the
North
Wind
rides
and
past
the
roaring
falls
And
clear
and
cold
about
the
tower
its
loud
horn
calls
What
news
from
the
North
mighty
wind
you
bring
today
What
news
Boromir
the
Bold
For
long
away
Beneath
Amon
Hen
heard
his
cry
There
many
foes
fought
His
cloven
shield
his
broken
sword
they
the
water
brought
His
head
proud
his
face
fair
his
limbs
they
laid
rest
And
Rauros
golden
Rauros
falls
bore
him
upon
its
breast
Boromir
The
Tower
Guard
shall
ever
northward
gaze
Rauros
golden
Rauros
falls
until
the
end
days
they
ended
Then
they
turned
their
boat
and
drove
with
all
the
speed
they
could
against
the
stream
back
Parth
Galen
You
left
the
East
Wind
said
Gimli
but
will
say
naught
That
should
said
Aragorn
Minas
Tirith
they
endure
the
East
Wind
but
they
not
ask
for
tidings
But
now
Boromir
has
taken
his
road
and
must
make
haste
choose
our
own
surveyed
the
green
lawn
quickly
but
thoroughly
stooping
often
the
earth
Orcs
have
been
this
ground
said
Otherwise
nothing
can
made
out
for
certain
All
our
footprints
are
here
crossing
and
crossing
cannot
tell
whether
any
the
hobbits
have
come
back
since
the
search
for
Frodo
began
returned
the
bank
close
where
the
rill
from
the
spring
trickled
out
into
the
River
There
are
some
clear
prints
here
said
hobbit
waded
out
into
the
water
and
back
but
cannot
say
how
long
ago
How
then
you
read
this
riddle
asked
Gimli
THE
DEPARTURE
BOROMIR
419
Aragorn
did
not
answer
once
but
went
back
the
camping
place
and
looked
the
baggage
packs
are
missing
said
and
one
certainly
Sam
was
rather
large
and
heavy
This
then
the
answer
Frodo
has
gone
boat
and
his
servant
has
gone
with
him
Frodo
must
have
returned
while
were
all
away
met
Sam
going
the
hill
and
told
him
follow
but
plainly
did
not
guessed
his
master
mind
and
came
back
here
before
Frodo
had
gone
did
not
find
easy
leave
Sam
behind
But
why
should
leave
behind
and
without
word
said
Gimli
That
was
strange
deed
And
brave
deed
said
Aragorn
Sam
was
right
think
Frodo
did
not
wish
lead
any
friend
death
with
him
Mordor
But
knew
that
must
himself
Something
happened
after
left
that
overcame
his
fear
and
doubt
Maybe
hunting
Orcs
came
him
and
fled
said
Legolas
fled
certainly
said
Aragorn
but
not
think
from
Orcs
What
thought
was
the
cause
Frodo
sudden
resolve
and
flight
Aragorn
did
not
say
The
last
words
Boromir
long
kept
secret
Well
much
least
now
clear
said
Legolas
Frodo
longer
this
side
the
River
only
can
have
taken
the
boat
And
Sam
with
him
only
would
have
taken
his
pack
Our
choice
then
said
Gimli
either
take
the
remaining
boat
and
follow
Frodo
else
follow
the
Orcs
foot
There
little
hope
either
way
have
already
lost
precious
hours
Let
think
said
Aragorn
And
now
may
make
right
choice
and
change
the
evil
fate
this
unhappy
day
stood
silent
for
moment
will
follow
the
Orcs
said
last
would
have
guided
Frodo
Mordor
and
gone
with
him
the
end
but
seek
him
now
the
wilderness
must
abandon
the
captives
torment
and
death
heart
speaks
clearly
last
the
fate
the
Bearer
hands
longer
The
Company
has
played
its
part
Yet
that
remain
cannot
forsake
our
companions
while
have
strength
left
Come
will
now
Leave
all
that
can
spared
behind
will
press
day
and
dark
They
drew
the
last
boat
and
carried
the
trees
They
laid
beneath
such
their
goods
they
did
not
need
and
could
not
carry
away
Then
they
left
Parth
Galen
The
afternoon
was
fading
they
came
back
the
glade
where
Boromir
had
fallen
There
they
picked
the
trail
the
Orcs
needed
little
skill
find
other
folk
make
such
trampling
said
Legolas
seems
their
delight
slash
and
beat
down
growing
things
that
are
not
even
their
way
But
they
with
great
speed
for
all
that
said
Aragorn
and
420
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
they
not
tire
And
later
may
have
search
for
our
path
hard
bare
lands
Well
after
them
said
Gimli
Dwarves
too
can
swiftly
and
they
not
tire
sooner
than
Orcs
But
will
long
chase
they
have
long
start
Yes
said
Aragorn
shall
all
need
the
endurance
Dwarves
But
come
With
hope
without
hope
will
follow
the
trail
our
enemies
And
woe
them
prove
the
swifter
will
make
such
chase
shall
accounted
marvel
among
the
Three
Kindreds
Elves
Dwarves
and
Men
Forth
the
Three
Hunters
Like
deer
sprang
away
Through
the
trees
sped
and
led
them
tireless
and
swift
now
that
his
mind
was
last
made
The
woods
about
the
lake
they
left
behind
Long
slopes
they
climbed
dark
hard
edged
against
the
sky
already
red
with
sunset
Dusk
came
They
passed
away
grey
shadows
stony
land
Chapter
THE
RIDERS
ROHAN
Dusk
deepened
Mist
lay
behind
them
among
the
trees
below
and
brooded
the
pale
margins
the
Anduin
but
the
sky
was
clear
Stars
came
out
The
waxing
moon
was
riding
the
West
and
the
shadows
the
rocks
were
black
They
had
come
the
feet
stony
hills
and
their
pace
was
slower
for
the
trail
was
longer
easy
follow
Here
the
highlands
the
Emyn
Muil
ran
from
North
South
two
long
tumbled
ridges
The
western
side
each
ridge
was
steep
and
difficult
but
the
eastward
slopes
were
gentler
furrowed
with
many
gullies
and
narrow
ravines
All
night
the
three
companions
scrambled
this
bony
land
climbing
the
crest
the
first
and
tallest
ridge
and
down
again
into
the
darkness
deep
winding
valley
the
other
side
There
the
still
cool
hour
before
dawn
they
rested
for
brief
space
The
moon
had
long
gone
down
before
them
the
stars
glittered
above
them
the
first
light
day
had
not
yet
come
over
the
dark
hills
behind
For
the
moment
Aragorn
was
loss
the
orc
trail
had
descended
into
the
valley
but
there
had
vanished
Which
way
would
they
turn
you
think
said
Legolas
North
ward
take
straighter
road
Isengard
Fangorn
that
their
aim
you
guess
southward
strike
the
Entwash
They
will
not
make
for
the
river
whatever
mark
they
aim
said
Aragorn
And
unless
there
much
amiss
Rohan
and
the
power
Saruman
greatly
increased
they
will
take
the
shortest
way
that
they
can
find
over
the
fields
the
Rohirrim
Let
search
northwards
The
dale
ran
like
stony
trough
between
the
ridged
hills
and
trickling
stream
flowed
among
the
boulders
the
bottom
cliff
frowned
upon
their
right
their
left
rose
grey
slopes
dim
and
shadowy
the
late
night
They
went
for
mile
more
north
wards
Aragorn
was
searching
bent
towards
the
ground
among
the
folds
and
gullies
leading
into
the
western
ridge
Legolas
was
some
way
ahead
Suddenly
the
Elf
gave
cry
and
the
others
came
running
towards
him
have
already
overtaken
some
those
that
are
hunting
said
Look
pointed
and
they
saw
that
what
they
had
first
taken
boulders
lying
the
foot
the
slope
were
huddled
bodies
Five
dead
Orcs
lay
there
They
had
been
hewn
with
many
422
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
cruel
strokes
and
two
had
been
beheaded
The
ground
was
wet
with
their
dark
blood
Here
another
riddle
said
Gimli
But
needs
the
light
day
and
for
that
cannot
wait
Yet
however
you
read
seems
not
unhopeful
said
Legolas
Enemies
the
Orcs
are
likely
our
friends
any
folk
dwell
these
hills
said
Aragorn
The
Rohirrim
seldom
come
here
and
far
from
Minas
Tirith
might
that
some
company
Men
were
hunting
here
for
reasons
that
not
know
Yet
think
not
What
you
think
said
Gimli
think
that
the
enemy
brought
his
own
enemy
with
him
answered
Aragorn
These
are
Northern
Orcs
from
far
away
Among
the
slain
are
none
the
great
Orcs
with
the
strange
badges
There
was
quarrel
guess
uncommon
thing
with
these
foul
folk
Maybe
there
was
some
dispute
about
the
road
about
the
captives
said
Gimli
Let
hope
that
they
too
did
not
meet
their
end
here
Aragorn
searched
the
ground
wide
circle
but
other
traces
the
fight
could
found
They
went
Already
the
eastward
sky
was
turning
pale
the
stars
were
fading
and
grey
light
was
slowly
growing
little
further
north
they
came
fold
which
tiny
stream
falling
and
winding
had
cut
stony
path
down
into
the
valley
some
bushes
grew
and
there
were
patches
grass
upon
its
sides
last
said
Aragorn
Here
are
the
tracks
that
seek
this
water
channel
this
the
way
that
the
Orcs
went
after
their
debate
Swiftly
now
the
pursuers
turned
and
followed
the
new
path
fresh
from
night
rest
they
sprang
from
stone
stone
last
they
reached
the
crest
the
grey
hill
and
sudden
breeze
blew
their
hair
and
stirred
their
cloaks
the
chill
wind
dawn
Turning
back
they
saw
across
the
River
the
far
hills
kindled
Day
leaped
into
the
sky
The
red
rim
the
sun
rose
over
the
shoulders
the
dark
land
Before
them
the
West
the
world
lay
still
formless
and
grey
but
even
they
looked
the
shadows
night
melted
the
colours
the
waking
earth
returned
green
flowed
over
the
wide
meads
Rohan
the
white
mists
shimmered
the
water
vales
and
far
off
the
left
thirty
leagues
more
blue
and
purple
stood
the
White
Mountains
rising
into
peaks
jet
tipped
with
glimmering
snows
flushed
with
the
rose

Now
let

drawing
his

away
from
the
South
and
looking
out
west
and
north
the
way
that
must
tread
The
ridge
upon
which
the
companions
stood
went
down
steeply
before
their
feet
Below
twenty
fathoms
more
there
was
wide
and
rugged
shelf
which
ended
suddenly
the
brink
sheer
cliff
the
East
Wall
Rohan
ended
the
Emyn

and
the

the
Rohirrim
stretched
away
before
them
the
edge
sight
Look
cried
Legolas
pointing
into
the
pale
sky
above
them
There
the
eagle
again
very
high
seems
flying
now
away
from
this
land
back
the
North
going
with
great
speed
Look
not
even
eyes
can
see
him
good
Legolas
said
Aragorn
must
far
aloft
indeed
wonder
what
his
errand
the
same
bird
that
have
seen
before
But
look
can
see
something
nearer
hand
and
more
urgent
there
something
moving
over
the
plain
Many
things
said

cannot

more
nor
see
what
kind

they
may
They
are
many

away
twelve
guess
but
the
flatness
the
plain
hard
measure
think
nonetheless
that
longer

any

tell
which
way
said
Gimli
Let
find
path
down
the
fields
quick
may
doubt
you
will
find
path
quicker
than
the
one
that
the
Orcs
chose
said
Aragorn
They
followed
their
enemies
now
the
clear
light
day
seemed
that
the
Orcs
had
pressed
with
all
possible
speed
Every
now
and
again
the
pursuers
found
things
that
had
been
dropped
cast
away
food
bags
the
rinds
and
crusts
hard
grey
bread
torn
black
cloak
heavy
iron
nailed

broken
the

The
trail
led
them
north
along
the
top
the
escarpment
and
length
they
came
deep
cleft

the
rock
stream
that
splashed
noisily
down
the
narrow
ravine
rough
path
descended
like
steep
stair
into
the
plain
the
bottom
they
came
with
strange
suddenness
the
grass
Rohan
swelled
like
green

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Muil
The
falling
stream
vanished
into
deep
growth
cresses
and
water
plants
and
they
could
hear
tinkling
away
green
tunnels
down
long
gentle
slopes
towards
the
fens
Entwash
Vale
far
away
They
seemed
have
left
winter
clinging
the
hills
behind
Here
the
air
was
softer
and
warmer
and
faintly
scented
spring
was
already
stirring
and
the
sap
was
flowing
again
herb
and
leaf
Legolas
took
deep
breath
like
one
that
drinks
great
draught
after
long
thirst
barren
places
the
green
smell
said
better
than
much
sleep
Let
run
Light
feet
may
run
swiftly
here
said
Aragorn
More
swiftly
maybe
than
iron
shod
Orcs
Now
have
chance
lessen
their
lead
They
went
single
file
running
like
hounds
strong
scent
and
eager
light
was
their
eyes
Nearly
due
west
the
broad
swath
the
marching
Orcs
tramped
its
ugly
slot
the
sweet
grass
Rohan
had
been
bruised
and
blackened
they
passed
Presently
Aragorn
gave
cry
and
turned
aside
Stay
shouted
not
follow
yet
ran
quickly
the
right
away
from
the
main
trail
for
had
seen
footprints
that
went
that
way
branching
off
from
the
others
the
marks
small
unshod
feet
These
however
did
not
far
before
they
were
crossed
orc
prints
also
coming
out
from
the
main
trail
behind
and
front
and
then
they
curved
sharply
back
again
and
were
lost
the
tramp
ling
the
furthest
point
Aragorn
stooped
and
picked
something
from
the
grass
then
ran
back
Yes
said
they
are
quite
plain
hobbit
footprints
Pippin
think
smaller
than
the
others
And
look
this
held
thing
that
glittered
the
sunlight
looked
like
the
new
opened
leaf
beech
tree
fair
and
strange
that
treeless
plain
The
brooch
elven
cloak
cried
Legolas
and
Gimli
together
Not
idly
the
leaves
Lorien
fall
said
Aragorn
This
did
not
drop
chance
was
cast
away
token
any
that
might
follow
think
Pippin
ran
away
from
the
trail
for
that
purpose
Then
least
was
alive
said
Gimli
And
had
the
use
his
wits
and
his
legs
too
That
heartening
not
pursue
vain
Let
hope
that
did
not
pay
too
dearly
for
his
boldness
said
Legolas
Come
Let
The
thought
those
merry
young
folk
driven
like
cattle
burns
heart
The
sun
climbed
the
noon
and
then
rode
slowly
down
the
sky
Light
clouds
came
out
the
sea
the
distant
South
and
were
THE
RIDERS
ROHAN
425
blown
away
upon
the
breeze
The
sun
sank
Shadows
rose
behind
and
reached
out
long
arms
from
the
East
Still
the
hunters
held
One
day
now
had
passed
since
Boromir
fell
and
the
Orcs
were
yet
far
ahead
longer
could
any
sight
them
seen
the
level
plains
nightshade
was
closing
about
them
Aragorn
halted
Only
twice
the
day
march
had
they
rested
for
brief
while
and
twelve
leagues
now
lay
between
them
and
the
eastern
wall
where
they
had
stood
dawn
have
come
last
hard
choice
said
Shall
rest
night
shall
while
our
will
and
strength
hold
Unless
our
enemies
rest
also
they
will
leave
far
behind
stay
sleep
said
Legolas
Surely
even
Orcs
must
pause
the
march
said
Gimli
Seldom
will
Orcs
journey
the
open
under
the
sun
yet
these
have
done
said
Legolas
Certainly
they
will
not
rest
night
But
walk
night
cannot
follow
their
trail
said
Gimli
The
trail
straight
and
turns
neither
right
nor
left
far
eyes
can
see
said
Legolas
Maybe
could
lead
you
guess
the
darkness
and
hold
the
line
said
Aragorn
but
strayed
they
turned
aside
then
when
light
came
there
might
long
delay
before
the
trail
was
found
again
And
there
this
also
said
Gimli
only
day
can
see
any
tracks
lead
away
prisoner
should
escape
one
should
carried
off
eastward
say
the
Great
River
towards
Mordor
might
pass
the
signs
and
never
know
That
true
said
Aragorn
But
read
the
signs
back
yonder
rightly
the
Orcs
the
White
Hand
prevailed
and
the
whole
company
now
bound
for
Isengard
Their
present
course
bears
out
Yet
would
rash
sure
their
counsels
said
Gimli
And
what
escape
the
dark
should
have
passed
the
signs
that
led
you
the
brooch
The
Orcs
will
doubly
their
guard
since
then
and
the
prisoners
even
wearier
said
Legolas
There
will
escape
again
not
contrive
How
that
done
cannot
guessed
but
first
must
overtake
them
And
yet
even
Dwarf
many
journeys
and
not
the
least
hardy
folk
cannot
run
all
the
way
Isengard
without
any
pause
said
Gimli
heart
burns
too
and
would
have
started
sooner
but
now
must
rest
little
run
the
better
And
rest
then
the
blind
night
the
time
said
that
was
hard
choice
said
Aragorn
How
shall
end
this
debate
426
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
You
are
our
guide
said
Gimli
and
you
are
skilled
the
chase
You
shall
choose
heart
bids
said
Legolas
But
must
hold
together
will
follow
your
counsel
You
give
the
choice
ill
chooser
said
Aragorn
Since
passed
through
the
Argonath
choices
have
gone
amiss
fell
silent
gazing
north
and
west
into
the
gathering
night
for
long
while
will
not
walk
the
dark
said
length
The
peril
missing
the
trail
signs
other
coming
and
going
seems
the
greater
the
Moon
gave
enough
light
would
use
but
alas
sets
early
and
yet
young
and
pale
And
tonight
shrouded
anyway
Gimli
murmured
Would
that
the
Lady
had
given
light
such
gift
she
gave
Frodo
will
more
needed
where
bestowed
said
Aragorn
With
him
lies
the
true
Quest
Ours
but
small
matter
the
great
deeds
this
time
vain
pursuit
from
its
beginning
maybe
which
choice
mine
can
mar
mend
Well
have
chosen
let
use
the
time
best
may
cast
himself
the
ground
and
fell
once
into
sleep
for
had
not
slept
since
their
night
under
the
shadow
Tol
Brandir
Before
dawn
was
the
sky
woke
and
rose
Gimli
was
still
deep
slumber
but
Legolas
was
standing
gazing
northwards
into
the
darkness
thoughtful
and
silent
young
tree
windless
night
They
are
far
far
away
said
sadly
turning
Aragorn
know
heart
that
they
have
not
rested
this
night
Only
eagle
could
overtake
them
now
Nonetheless
will
still
follow
may
said
Aragorn
Stooping
roused
the

The

But

Gimli

said
Legolas
Where

the
earth

bring
rumour
said
Aragorn
The
land
must
groan
under
their
hated
feet
stretched
himself
upon
the
ground
with
his
ear
pressed
against
the
turf
lay
there
motionless
for
long
time
that
Gimli
wondered
had
swooned
fallen
asleep
again
Dawn
came
glimmering
and
slowly
grey
light
grew
about
them
last
rose
and
now
his
friends
could
see
his
face
was
pale
and
drawn
and
his
look
was
troubled
The
rumour
the
earth
dim
and
confused
said
Nothing

upon
for
many
miles
about
Faint

But

that
heard
them
even
lay
the
ground
sleep
and
they
troubled
dreams
horses
galloping
passing
the
West
But
now
they
are
drawing
ever
further
from
riding
northward
wonder
what
happening
this
land
Let
said
Legolas
the
third
day
their
pursuit
began
During
all
its
long
hours
cloud
and
fitful
sun
they
hardly
paused
now
striding
now
running
weariness
could
quench
the
fire
that
burned
them
They
seldom
spoke
Over
the
wide
solitude
they
passed
and
their
elven
cloaks
faded
against
the
background
the
grey
green
fields
even
the
cool
sunlight
mid
day
few
but
Elvish
eyes
would
have
marked
them
until
they
were
close
hand
Often
their
hearts
they
thanked
the
Lady
Lorien
for
the
gift
lembas
for
they
could
eat
and
find
new
strength
even
they
ran
All
day
the
track
their
enemies
led
straight
going
north
west
without
break
turn
once
again
the
day
wore
its
end
they
came
long
treeless
slopes
where
the
land
rose
swelling
towards
line
low
humpbacked
downs
ahead
The
orc
trail
grew
fainter
bent
north
towards
them
for
the
ground
became
harder
and
the
grass
shorter
Far
away
the
left
the
river
Entwash
wound
silver
thread
green
floor
moving
thing
could
seen
Often
Aragorn
wondered
that
they
saw
sign
beast
man
The
dwell
ings
the
Rohirrim
were
for
the
most
part
many
leagues
away
the
South
under
the
wooded
eaves
the
White
Mountains
now
hidden
mist
and
cloud
yet
the
Horse
lords
had
formerly
kept
many
herds
and
studs
the
Eastemnet
this
easterly
region
their
realm
and
there
the
herdsmen
had
wandered
much
living
camp
and
tent
even
winter
time
But
now
all
the
land
was
empty
and
there
was
silence
that
did
not
seem
the
quiet
peace
dusk
they
halted
again
Now
twice
twelve
leagues
they
had
passed
over
the
plains
Rohan
and
the
wall
the
Emyn
Muil
was
lost
the
shadows
the
East
The
young
moon
was
glimmering
misty
sky
but
gave
small
light
and
the
stars
were
veiled
Now
most
grudge
time
rest
any
halt
our
chase
said
Legolas
The
Orcs
have
run
before
the
very
whips
Sauron
were
behind
them
fear
they
have
already
reached
the
forest
and
the
dark
hills
and
even
now
are
passing
into
the
shadows
the
trees
Gimli
ground
his
teeth
This
bitter
end
our
hope
and
all
our
toil
said
hope
maybe
but
not
toil
said
Aragorn
shall
not
turn
back
here
Yet
weary
gazed
back
along
the
way
that
428
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
they
had
come
towards
the
night
gathering
the
East
There
something
strange
work
this
land
distrust
the
silence
distrust
even
the
pale
Moon
The
stars
are
faint
and
weary
have
seldom
been
before
weary
Ranger
should
with
clear
trail
follow
There
some
will
that
lends
speed
our
foes
and
sets
unseen
barrier
before
weariness
that
the
heart
more
than
the
limb
Truly
said
Legolas
That
have
known
since
first
came
down
from
the
Emyn
Muil
For
the
will
not
behind
but
before
pointed
away
over
the
land
Rohan
into
the
darkling
West
under
the
sickle
moon
Saruman
muttered
Aragorn
But
shall
not
turn
back
Halt
must
once
more
for
see
even
the
Moon
falling
into
gathering
cloud
But
north
lies
our
road
between
down
and
fen
when
day
returns
before
Legolas
was
first
afoot
indeed
had
ever
slept
Awake
Awake
cried
red
dawn
Strange
things
await
the
eaves
the
forest
Good
evil
not
know
but
are
called
Awake
The
others
sprang
and
almost
once
they
set
off
again
Slowly
the
downs
drew
near
was
still
hour
before
noon
when
they
reached
them
green
slopes
rising
bare
ridges
that
ran
line
straight
towards
the
North
their
feet
the
ground
was
dry
and
the
turf
short
but
long
strip
sunken
land
some
ten
miles
wide
lay
between
them
and
the
river
wandering
deep
dim
thickets
reed
and
rush
Just
the
West
the
southernmost
slope
there
was
great
ring
where
the
turf
had
been
torn
and
beaten
many
trampling
feet
From
the
orc
trail
ran
out
again
turning
north
along
the
dry
skirts
the
hills
Aragorn
halted
and
examined
the
tracks
closely
They
rested
here
while
said
but
even
the
outward

already
old
fear
that
your
heart
spoke
truly
Legolas
thrice
twelve
hours
guess
since
the
Orcs
stood

now

they
held
their
pace
then

they
would

Fangorn
can
see
nothing

said
Gimli
Could

Aragorn

The
sun
was
sinking
when
last
they
drew
near
the
end
the
line
downs
For
many
hours
they
had
marched
without
rest
They
were
going
slowly
now
and
Gimli
back
was
bent
Stone
hard
are
the
Dwarves
labour
journey
but
this
endless
chase
began
tell
him
all
hope
failed
his
heart
Aragorn
walked
behind
him
grim
and
silent
stooping
now
and
again
scan
some
print
mark
upon
the
ground
Only
Legolas
still
stepped
lightly
ever
his
feet
hardly
seeming
press
the
grass
leaving
footprints
passed
but
the
waybread
the
Elves
found
all
the
sustenance
that
needed
and
could

sleep

resting
his
mind
the
strange

Elvish
dreams
even
walked
open
eyed
the
light
this

Let
this
green
hill
said
Wearily
they
followed
him
climbing
the
long
slope
until
they
came
out
upon
the
top
was
round
hill
smooth
and
bare
standing
itself
the
most
northerly
the
downs
The
sun
sank
and
the
shadows
evening
fell
like
curtain
They
were
alone
grey
formless
world
without
mark
measure
Only
far
away
north
west
there
was
deeper
darkness
against
the
dying
light
the
Mountains
Mist
and
the
forest
their
feet
Nothing
can
see
guide
here
said
Gimli
Well
now
must
halt
again
and
wear
the
night
away
growing
cold
The
wind
north
from
the
snows
said
Aragorn
And
ere
morning
will
the
East
said
Legolas
But
rest
you
must
Yet
not
cast
all
hope
away
Tomorrow
unknown
Rede
oft

Sun
Three
suns
already
have
risen
our
chase
and
brought
counsel
said
Gimli
The
night
grew
ever
colder
Aragorn
and
Gimli
slept
fitfully
and
whenever
they
awoke
they
saw
Legolas
standing
beside
them
walking
and
fro
singing
softly
himself
his
own
tongue
and
sang
the
white
stars
opened
the
hard
black
vault
above
the
night
passed
Together
they
watched
the
dawn
grow
slowly
the
sky
now
bare
and
cloudless
until
last
the
sunrise
came
was
pale
and
clear
The
wind
was
the
East
and
all
the
mists
had
rolled
away
wide
lands
lay
bleak
about
them
the
bitter
light
Ahead
and
eastward
they
saw
the
windy
uplands
the
Wold
Rohan
that
they
had
already
glimpsed
many
days
ago
from
the
Great
River
North
westward
stalked
the
dark
forest
Fangorn
still
ten
leagues
away
stood
its
shadowy
eaves
and
its
further
slopes
faded
into
the
distant
blue
Beyond
there
glimmered
far
away
floating
grey
cloud
the

Out
the

THE

them
its
stream
now
swift
and
narrow
and
its
banks
deep
cloven
The
orc
trail
turned
from
the
downs
towards
Following
with
his
keen
eyes
the
trail
the
river
and
then
the
river
back
towards
the
forest
Aragorn
saw
shadow
the
distant
green
dark
swift
moving
blur
cast
himself
upon
the
ground
and
listened
again
intently
But
Legolas
stood
beside
him
shading
his
bright
elven
eyes
with
his
long
slender
hand
and
saw
not
shadow
nor
blur
but
the
small
figures
horsemen
many
horse
men
and
the
glint
morning
the
tips
their
spears
was
like
the
twinkle
minute
stars
beyond
the
edge
mortal
sight
Far
behind
them
dark
smoke
rose
thin
curling
threads
There
was

Aragorn

There

Legolas
did
not
say
that

said
Aragorn
But

good
will

The
three
companions
now
left
the
hill
top
where
they
might
easy
mark
against
the
pale
sky
and
they
walked
slowly
down
the
northward
slope
little
above
the
hill
foot
they
halted
and
wrapping
their
cloaks
about
them
they
sat
huddled
together
upon
the
faded
grass
The
time
passed
slowly
and
heavily
The
wind
was
thin
and
searching
Gimli
was
uneasy
What
you
know
these
horsemen
Aragorn
said

Aragorn
They

though

them
was
for
gotten
years
long
ago
that
Eorl
the
Young
brought
them
out
the
North
and
their
kinship
rather
with
the

and
with

Beornings

among
whom
may
still

and

are

least
they
will
not
love
the
Orcs
But
Gandalf
spoke
rumour
that
they
pay
tribute
Mordor
said
Gimli
believe
more
than
did
Boromir
answered
Aragorn
You
will
soon
learn
the
truth
said
Legolas
Already
they
approach
length
even
Gimli
could
hear
the
distant
beat
galloping
hoofs
The
horsemen
following
the
trail
had
turned
from
the
river
and
were
drawing
near
the
downs
They
were
riding
like
the
wind
Now
the
cries
clear
strong
voices
came
ringing
over
the
fields
Suddenly
they
swept
with
noise
like
thunder
and
the
foremost
horseman
swerved
passing
the
foot
the
hill
and
leading
the
host
back
southward
along
the
western
skirts
the
downs
After
him
they
rode
long
line
mail
clad
men
swift
shining
fell
and
fair
look
upon
Their
horses
were
great
stature
strong
and
clean
limbed
their
grey
coats
glistened
their
long
tails
flowed
the
wind
their
manes
were
braided
their
proud
necks
The
Men
that
rode
them
matched
them
well
tall
and
long
limbed
their
hair
flaxen
pale
flowed
under
their
light
helms
and
streamed
long
braids
behind
them
their
faces
were
stern
and
keen
their
hands
were
tall
spears
ash
painted
shields
were
slung
their
backs
long
swords
were
their
belts
their
burnished
shirts
mail
hung
down
upon
their
knees
pairs
they
galloped
and
though
every
now
and
then
one
rose
his
stirrups
and
gazed
ahead
and
either
side
they
appeared
not
perceive
the
three
strangers
sitting
silently
and
watching
them
The
host
had
almost
passed
when
suddenly
Aragorn
stood
and
called
loud
voice
What
news
from
the
North
Riders
Rohan
With
astonishing
speed
and
skill
they
checked
their
steeds
wheeled
and
came
charging
round
Soon
the
three
companions
found
themselves
ring
horsemen
moving
running
circle
the
hill
slope
behind
them
and
down
round
and
round
them
and
drawing
ever
inwards
Aragorn
stood
silent
and
the
other
two
sat
without
moving
wondering
what
way
things
would
turn
Without
word
cry
suddenly
the
Riders
halted
thicket
spears
were
pointed
towards
the
strangers
and
some
the
horsemen
432
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
had
bows
hand
and
their
arrows
were
already
fitted
the
string
Then
one
rode
forward
tall
man
taller
than
all
the
rest
from
his
helm
crest
white
horsetail
flowed
advanced
until
the
point
his
spear
was
within
foot
Aragorn
breast
Aragorn
did
not
stir
Who
are
you
and
what
are
you
doing
this
land
said
the
Rider
using
the
Common
Speech
the
West
manner
and
tone
like
the
speech
Boromir
Man
Gondor
called
Strider
answered
Aragorn
came
out
the
North
hunting
Orcs
The
Rider
leaped
from
his
horse
Giving
his
spear
another
who
rode
and
dismounted
his
side
drew
his
sword
and
stood
face
face
with
Aragorn
surveying
him
keenly
and
not
without
wonder
length
spoke
again
first
thought
that
you
yourselves
were
Orcs
said
but
now
see
that
not
Indeed
you
know
little
Orcs
you
hunting
them
this
fashion
They
were
swift
and
well
armed
and
they
were
many
You
would
have
changed
from
hunters
prey
ever
you
had
overtaken
them
But
there
something
strange
about
you
Strider
bent
his
clear
bright
eyes
again
upon
the
Ranger
That
name
for
Man
that
you
give
And
strange
too
your
raiment
Have
you
sprung
out
the
grass
How
did
you
escape
our
sight
Are
you
Elvish
folk
said
Aragorn
One
only
Elf
Legolas
from
the
Woodland
Realm
distant
Mirkwood
But
have
passed
through
Lothlorien
and
the
gifts

Lady

The
Rider
looked
them
with
renewed
wonder
but
his
eyes
hardened
Then
there
Lady

Golden
Wood
old
tales
tell
said
Few
escape
her
nets
they
say
These
are
strange
days
But
you
have
her
favour
then
you
also
are
net
weavers
and
sorcerers
maybe
turned
cold
glance
suddenly
upon
Legolas
and
Gimli
Why
you
not
speak
silent
ones
demanded
Gimli
rose
and
planted
his
feet
firmly
apart
his
hand
gripped
the
handle
his
axe
and
his
dark
eyes
flashed
Give
your
name
horse
master
and
will
give
you
mine
and
more
besides
said
for
that
said
the
Rider
staring
down
the
Dwarf
the
stranger
should
declare
himself
first
Yet
named
Eomer
son
Eomund
and
called
the
Third
Marshal
Riddermark
Then
Eomer
son
Eomund
Third
Marshal
Riddermark
let
Gimli
the
Dwarf
Gloin
son
warn
you
against
foolish
words
You
speak
evil
that
which
fair
beyond
the
reach
your
thought
and
only
little
wit
can
excuse
you
Eomer
eyes
blazed
and
the
Men
Rohan
murmured
angrily
and

their
spears

little
higher

said
Eomer
stands
not
alone
said
Legolas
bending
his
bow
and
fitting
arrow
with
hands
that
moved
quicker
than
sight
You
would
die
before
your
stroke
fell
Eomer
raised
his
sword
and
things
might
have
gone
ill
but
Aragorn
sprang
between
them
and
raised
his
hand
Your
pardon
Eomer
cried
When
you
know
more
you
will
understand
why
you
have
angered
companions
intend
evil
Rohan
nor
any
its
folk
neither
man
nor

Will
you
not
hear
our
tale
before
you
strike

said
Eomer
lowering
his
blade
But
wanderers
the
Riddermark
would
wise
less
haughty
these
days
doubt
First
tell
your
right
name
First
tell
whom
you

Aragorn
Are

Sauron

Eomer

but
neither

open

with

and
you
are
fleeing

then
you
had

There

Come

said
Aragorn
but
the
servants
Sauron
pursue
into
whatever

they
may
There
are

Men
who

The

Nor

Aragorn
threw

The

and
the

Anduril
shone
like

swept

for
they
had
not
seen
him
this
mood
before

grown

while

had
shrunk

they

For

THE

moment
seemed
the
eyes
Legolas
that
white
flame
flickered
the
brows
Aragorn
like
shining
crown
Eomer
stepped
back
and
look
awe
was
his
face
cast
down
his
proud
eyes
These
are
indeed
strange
days
muttered
Dreams
and
legends
spring

out
the

Tell

what
brings
you

And
what
was
the
meaning
the
dark
words
Long
has
Boromir

Denethor
been
gone
seeking
answer
and
the
horse
that
lent
him
came
back
riderless
What
doom
you
bring
out
the
North
The
doom
choice
said
Aragorn
You
may
say
this
Théoden
son
Thengel
open
war
lies
before
him
with
Sauron
against
him
None
may
live

they
have

shall
keep

they
call
their
own
But
these
great
matters
will
speak
later

come
myself
the

Now
great
need
and
ask
for
help
least
for
tidings
You
heard
that
are
pursuing
orc
host
that
carried
off
our
friends
What
can
you
tell
That
you
need
not
pursue
them
further
said
Eomer
The
Orcs
are
destroyed
And
our
friends
found
none
but
Orcs
But
that
strange
indeed
said
Aragorn
Did
you
search
the
slain
Were
there
bodies
other
than
those
orc
kind
They
would
small
only
children
your
eyes
unshod
but
clad
grey
There
were
dwarves
nor
children
said
Eomer
counted
all
the
slain
and
despoiled
them
and
then
piled
the
carcases
and
burned
them
our
custom
The
ashes
are
smoking
still
not
speak
dwarves
children
said
Gimli
Our
friends
were
hobbits
Hobbits
said
Eomer
And
what
may
they

name
strange

said
Gimli
But
these
were
very
dear
seems
that
you
have
heard
Rohan
the
words
that
troubled
Minas

They
spoke
the
Halfling
These
hobbits
are
Halflings
Halflings
laughed
the

Let

Muttering
Eothain
retired
and
spoke
the
others
Soon
they
drew
off
and
left
Eomer
alone
with
the
three
companions
All
that
you
say
strange
Aragorn
said
Yet
you
speak
the
truth
that
plain
the
Men
the
Mark
not
lie
and
therefore
they
are
not
easily
deceived
But
you
have
not
told
all
Will
you
not
now
speak
more
fully
your
errand
that
may
judge
what
set
out
from
Imladris

Aragorn
With

But
the
Company
that

with
had
other
business
that
cannot
speak
now
Gandalf
the
Grey
was
our
leader
Gandalf
Eomer
exclaimed
Gandalf

but
his

you

bringer

some
now
say
Indeed
since
his
last
coming
the
summer
all
things
have
gone
amiss
that
time
our
trouble
with
Saruman
began
Until
then
counted
Saruman
our
friend
but
Gandalf
came
then
and
warned
that
sudden
war
was
preparing
Isengard
said
that
himself
had
been
prisoner
Orthanc
and
had
hardly
escaped
and
begged
for
help
But
Théoden
would
not
listen
him
and
went
away
Speak
not
the
name
Gandalf
loudly
Théoden
ears
wroth
For
Gandalf
took
the
horse
that
called
Shadowfax
the
most
precious
all
the
king
steeds
chief
the
Mearas
which
only
the
Lord

Mark
may
ride
For
the

the

Eorl
that
knew

Men
Seven

Shadowfax
returned
but
the

anger
not
less
for
now
the

wild
and
will
let

handle
him
Then
Shadowfax
has
found
his
way
alone
from

far
North
said
Aragorn
for
was
there
that
and
Gandalf
parted
But
alas
Gandalf
will
ride
longer
fell
into
darkness
the
Mines
Moria
and
comes
not
again
That
heavy

said
Eomer

and
many
though
not
all

find
you

grievous

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
though
may
touch
them
sorely
ere
the
year
much
older
said
Aragorn
But
when
the
great
fall
the
less
must
lead
part
has
been
guide
our
Company
the
long
road
from
Moria
Through
Lorien
came
which
were
well
that
you
should
learn
the
truth
ere
you
speak
again
and
thence
down
the
leagues
the
Great
River
the
falls
Rauros
There
Boromir
was
slain
the
same
Orcs
whom
you
destroyed
Your
news
all
woe
cried
Eomer
dismay
Great
harm
this
death
Minas
Tirith
and
all
That
was
worthy
man
All
spoke
his
praise
came
seldom
the
Mark
for
was
ever
the
wars
the
East
borders
but
have
seen
him
More
like
the
swift
sons
Eorl
than
the
grave
Men
Gondor
seemed
and
likely
prove
great
captain
his
people
when
his
time
came
But
have
had
word
this
grief
out
Gondor
When
did
fall
now
the
fourth
day
since
was
slain
answered
Aragorn
and
since
the
evening
that
day
have
journeyed
from
the
shadow
Tol
Brandir
foot
cried
Eomer
Yes
even
you
see
Wide
wonder
came
into
Eomer
eyes
Strider
too
poor
name
son
Arathorn
said
Wingfoot
name
you
This
deed
the
three
friends
should
sung
many
hall
Forty
leagues
and
five
you
have
measured
ere
the
fourth
day
ended
Hardy
the
race
Elendil
But
now
lord
what
would
you
have
must
return
haste
Théoden
spoke
warily
before
men
true
that
are
not
yet
open
war
with
the
Black
Land
and
there
are
some
close
the
king
ear
that
speak
craven
counsels
but
war
coming
shall
not
forsake
our
old
alliance
with
Gondor
and
while
they
fight
shall
aid
them
say
and
all
who
hold
with
The
East
mark
charge
the
ward
the
Third
Marshal
and
have
removed
all
our
herds
and
herdfolk
withdrawing
them
beyond
Entwash
and
leaving
none
here
but
guards
and
swift
scouts
Then
you
not
pay
tribute
Sauron
said
Gimli
not
and
never
have
said
Eomer
with
flash
his
eyes
though
comes
ears
that
that
lie
has
been
told
Some
years
ago
the
Lord
the
Black
Land
wished
purchase
horses
great
price
but
refused
him
for
puts
beasts
evil
use
Then
sent
plundering
Orcs
and
they
carry
off
what
they
can
choosing
always
the
black
horses
few
these
are
now
left
For
that
reason
our

Aragorn
There
was

wonder

many
dark
and
doubtful
glances
among
his
men
when
Eomer
gave
orders
that

Legolas
Then
all

you

neither

one
great
dark
grey
horse

brought
Aragorn

Eomer
May

better

Garulf
his

smaller

Legolas
Arod
was
his

But
Legolas
asked
them

off

them
not

and
leaped
lightly
and
their

Arod
was

and

him

with

spoken

was
the

Gimli
was

behind

and
clung
him
not

more
ease
than

Farewell

Eomer
Return
with

Aragorn
did
not
look
back
was
watching
the
trail
they
sped
their
way
bending
low
with
his
head
beside
the
neck
Hasufel
Before
long
they
came
the
borders
the
Entwash
and
there
they
met
the
other
trail
which
Eomer
had
spoken
coming
down
from
the
East
out
the
Wold
Aragorn
dismounted
and
surveyed
the
ground
then
leaping
back
into
the
saddle
rode
away
for
some
distance
eastward
keeping
one
side
and
taking
care
not
override
the
footprints
Then
again
dismounted
and
examined
the
ground
going
backwards
and
forwards

There
little
discover
said
when
returned
The
main
trail
all
confused
with
the
passage
the

the

back

Anduin
Now
must
ride
slower
and
make
sure
that

branches
off
either
side
The
Orcs
must
have
been
aware
from
this
point
that
they
were
pur
sued
they
may
have
made
some
attempt
get
their
captives
away
before
they
were
overtaken
they
rode
forward
the
day
was
overcast
Low
grey
clouds
came
over
the
Wold
mist
shrouded
the

Ever
nearer
the

Fangorn
loomed
slowly
darkling
the
sun

They
saw

here
and
there
they
passed
single
Orcs
fallen
their
tracks
they
ran
with
grey
feathered
arrows
sticking
back

last
the
afternoon
was
waning
they
came
the
eaves
the
forest
and
open
glade
among
the

they
found
the

Beside

Legolas
But
Gandalf

Gimli
His

failed
him
The
counsel
Gandalf
was
not

Aragorn
There
are
some

that

refuse
even
though
the
end

But
shall
not
depart
from
this

here
await
the

beyond

Gimli
and
they

Yet
they
passed
the
night
after
safely
here
when
their
labour
was
ended
They
were

said
Aragorn
and
they
not
heed
the
wrath
Fangorn
for
they

here
seldom
and
they
not

But
our

Cut

Gimli
The
Riders

enough
and
there
dead

lying
plenty
went
off
gather
fuel
and
busied
himself
with
building
and
kindling
fire
but
Aragorn
sat
silent
with
his
back
the
great
tree
deep
thought
and
Legolas
stood
alone
the
open
looking
towards
the
profound
shadow
the
wood
leaning
forward
one
who
listens
voices
calling
from
distance
When
the
Dwarf
had
small
bright
blaze
going
the
three
com
panions
drew
close
and
sat
together
shrouding
the
light
with
their
hooded
forms
Legolas
looked
the
boughs
the
tree
reaching
out
above
them
Look
said
The
tree
glad
the
fire
may
have
been
that
the
dancing
shadows
tricked
their
eyes
but

THE

each

the

ing
this

and
that

above
the
flames
while
the
upper
branches
were
stooping
down
the
brown
leaves
now
stood
out
stiff
and
rubbed
together
like
many
cold
cracked
hands
taking
comfort
the
warmth
There
was
silence
for
suddenly
the
dark
and
unknown
forest
near
hand
made
itself
felt
great
brooding
presence
full
secret
purpose
After
while
Legolas
spoke
again
Celeborn
warned
not
far
into
Fangorn
said
you
know
why
Aragorn
What
are
the
fables
the
forest
that
Boromir
had
heard
have
heard
many
tales
Gondor
and
elsewhere
said
Aragorn
but
were
not
for
the
words
Celeborn
should
deem
them
only
fables
that
Men
have
made
true
knowledge
fades
had
thought
asking
you
what
was
the
truth
the
matter
And
Elf
the
wood
does
not
know
how
shall
Man
answer
You
have
journeyed
further
than
said
Legolas
have
heard
nothing
this
own
land
save
only
songs
that
tell
how
the
Onodrim
that
Men
call
Ents
dwelt
there
long
ago
for
Fangorn
old
old
even
the
Elves
would
reckon
Yes
old
said
Aragorn
old
the
forest
the
Barrow
downs
and

Elrond
says
that
the
two
are
akin
the
last
strongholds
the
mighty
woods
the
Elder
Days
which
the
Firstborn
roamed
while
Men
still
slept
Yet
Fangorn
holds
some
secret
its
own
What
not
know
And
not
wish
know
said
Gimli
Let
nothing
that
dwells
Fangorn
troubled
account
They
now
drew
lots
for
the
watches
and
the
lot
for
the
first
watch
fell
Gimli
The
others
lay
down
Almost

Gimli

Aragorn
drowsily
Remember

But
not

Let

Call

With
that
fell
asleep
Legolas
already
lay
motionless
his
fair
hands
folded
upon
his
breast
his
eyes
unclosed
blending
living
night
and
deep
dream
the
way
with
Elves
Gimli
sat
hunched
the
fire
running
his
thumb
thoughtfully
along
the
edge
his
axe
The
tree
rustled
There
was
other
sound
Suddenly
Gimli
looked
and
there
just
the
edge
the
firelight
stood
old
bent
man
leaning
staff
and
wrapped
great
cloak
his
wide
brimmed
hat
was
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
Gimli
sprang
too
amazed
for
the
moment
cry
out
though
once
the
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
that
Saruman
had
caught
them
Both
Aragorn
and
Legolas
roused
his
sudden
movement
sat
and
stared
The
old
man
did
not
speak

Well

Aragorn

Come

strode
forward
but
the
old
man
was
gone
There
was
trace
him
found
near
hand
and
they
did
not
dare
wander
far
The
moon
had
set
and
the
night
was
very
dark
Suddenly
Legolas
gave
cry
The
horses
The
horses
The
horses
were
gone
They
had
dragged
their
pickets
and
dis
appeared
For
some
time
the
three
companions
stood
still
and
silent
troubled
this
new
stroke

fortune
They
were
under

Fangorn
and
endless
leagues
lay
between

this

and
dangerous
land
they
stood
seemed
them
that
they
heard
far
off
the
night
the
sound
horses
whinnying
and
neighing
Then
all
was
quiet
again
except
for
the
cold
rustle
the
wind
Well

Only

Legolas
You

Remember

Those

There

Aragorn
But
marked
also
that
this
old
man
had

not

Still
not

that
you

right

that

The
night
passed
slowly
Legolas
followed
Aragorn
and
Gimli
followed
Legolas
and
their
watches
wore
away
But
nothing
hap
pened
The
old
man
did
not
appear
again
and
the
horses
did
not
return
Chapter
THE
URUK
HAI
Pippin
lay
dark
and
troubled
dream
seemed
that
could
hear
his
own
small
voice
echoing
black
tunnels
calling
Frodo
Frodo
But
instead
Frodo
hundreds
hideous
orc
faces
grinned
him
out
the
shadows
hundreds
hideous
arms
grasped
him
from
every
side
Where
was
Merry
woke
Cold
air
blew
his
face
was
lying
his
back
Evening
was
coming
and
the
sky
above
was
growing
dim
turned
and
found
that
the
dream
was
little
worse
than
the
waking
His
wrists
legs
and
ankles
were
tied
with
cords
Beside
him
Merry
lay
white
faced
with
dirty
rag
bound
across
his
brows
All
about
them
sat
stood
great
company
Orcs
Slowly
Pippin
aching
head
memory
pieced
itself
together
and
became
separated
from
dream
shadows
course
and
Merry
had
run
off
into
the
woods
What
had
come
over
them
Why
had
they
dashed
off
like
that
taking
notice
old
Strider
They
had
run
long
way
shouting
could
not
remember
how
far
how
long
and
then
suddenly
they
had
crashed
right
into
group
Orcs
they
were
standing
listening
and
they
did
not
appear
see
Merry
and
Pippin
until
they
were
almost
their
arms
Then
they
yelled
and
dozens
other
goblins
had
sprung
out
the
trees
Merry
and
had
drawn
their
swords
but
the
Orcs
did
not
wish
fight
and
had
tried
only
lay
hold
them
even
when
Merry
had
cut
off
several
their
arms
and
hands
Good
old
Merry
Then
Boromir
had
come
leaping
through
the
trees
had
made
them
fight
slew
many
them
and
the
rest
fled
But
they
had
not
gone
far
the
way
back
when
they
were
attacked
again
hundred
Orcs
least
some
them
very
large
and
they
shot
rain
arrows
always
Boromir
Boromir
had
blown
his
great
horn
till
the
woods
rang
and
first
the
Orcs
had
been
dismayed
and
had
drawn
back
but
when
answer
but
the
echoes
came
they
had
attacked
more
fiercely
than
ever
Pippin
did
not
remember
much
more
His
last
memory
was
Boromir
leaning
against
tree
plucking
out
arrow
then
darkness
fell
suddenly
suppose
was
knocked
the
head
said
himself
wonder
poor
Merry
much
hurt
What
has
happened
Boromir
Why
didn
the
Orcs
kill
Where
are
and
where
are
going
could
not
answer
the
questions
felt
cold
and
sick
wish
Gandalf
had
never
persuaded
Elrond
let
come
thought
THE
URUK
HAI
445
What
good
have
been
Just
nuisance
passenger
piece
luggage
And
now
have
been
stolen
and
just
piece
luggage
for
the
Orcs
hope
Strider
someone
will
come
and
claim
But
ought
hope
for
Won
that
throw
out
all
the
plans
wish
could
get
free
struggled
little
quite
uselessly
One
the
Orcs
sitting
near
laughed
and
said
something
companion
their
abominable
tongue
Rest
while
you
can
little
fool
said
then
Pippin
the
Common
Speech
which
made
almost
hideous
his
own
language
Rest
while
you
can
find
use
for
your
legs
before
long
You
wish
you
had
got
none
before
get
home
had
way
you
wish
you
were
dead
now
said
the
other
make
you
squeak
you
miserable
rat
stooped
over
Pippin
bringing
his
yellow
fangs
close
his
face
had
black
knife
with
long
jagged
blade
his
hand
Lie
quiet
tickle
you
with
this
hissed
Don
draw

yourself
may
forget

Curse

Isengarders
Uglik
bagronk

Saruman
glob
bubhosh
skav
passed
into
long
angry
speech
his
own
tongue
that
slowly
died
away
into
muttering
and
snarling
Terrified
Pippin
lay
still
though
the
pain
his
wrists
and
ankles
was
growing
and
the
stones
beneath
him
were
boring
into
his
back
take
his
mind
off
himself
listened
intently
all
that
could
hear
There
were
many
voices
round
about
and
though
orc
speech
sounded
all
times
full
hate
and
anger
seemed
plain
that
something
like
quarrel
had
begun
and
was
getting
hotter
Pippin
surprise
found
that
much
the
talk
was
intelligible
many
the
Orcs
were
using
ordinary
language
Apparently
the
members
two
three
quite
different
tribes
were
present
and
they
could
not
understand
one
another
orc
speech
There
was
angry
debate
concerning
what
they
were
now
which
way
they
were
take
and
what
should
done
with
the
prisoners
There
time
kill
them
properly
said
one
time
for
play
this
trip
That
can
helped
said
another
But
why
not
kill
them
quick
kill
them
now
They
cursed
nuisance
and
hurry
Evening
coming
and
ought
get
move
Orders
said
third
voice
deep
growl
Kill
all
but
NOT
the
Halflings
they
are
brought
back
ALIVE
quickly
possible
That
orders
What
are
they
wanted
for
asked
several
voices
Why
alive
they
give
good
sport
heard
that
one
them
has
got
something
something
that
446
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
wanted
for
the
War
some
Elvish
plot
other
Anyway
they
both
questioned
that
all
you
know
Why
don
search
them
and
find
out
might
find
something
that
could
use
ourselves
That
very
interesting
remark
sneered
voice
softer
than
the
others
but
more
evil
may
have
report
that
The
prisoners
are
NOT
searched
plundered
those
are
orders
And
mine
too
said
the
deep
voice
Alive
and
captured
spoiling
That
orders
Not
our
orders
said
one
the
earlier
voices
have
come
all
the
way
from
the
Mines
kill
and
avenge
our
folk
wish
kill
and
then
back
north
Then
you

said
the
growling
voice
Ugluk
command
return
Isengard
the
shortest
road
Saruman
the
master
the
Great
Eye
said
the
evil
voice

back
once
Lugburz
could
cross
the
Great
River
might
said
another
voice
But
there
are
not
enough
venture
down
the
bridges
came
across
said
the
evil
voice
winged
Nazgtl
awaits
northward
the
east
bank
Maybe
maybe
Then
you
fly
off
with
our
prisoners
and
get
all
the
pay
and
praise
Lugburz
and
leave
foot
best
can
through
the
Horse
country
must
stick
together
These
lands
are
dangerous
full
foul
rebels
and
brigands
Aye
must
stick

growled
Ugluk
don
trust
you
little
swine
You
guts
outside
your
own
sties
But
for
you
all
have
run
away
are
the

Saruman

led
you
here
and
shall
lead
you
back
the
way

Ugluk
have
spoken
You
have
spoken
more
than
enough
Ugluk
sneered
the
evil
voice
wonder
how
they
would
like
Lugbtrz
They
might
think
that
Uglik
shoulders
needed
relieving
swollen
head
They
might
ask
where
his
strange
ideas
came
from
Did
they
come
from
Saruman
perhaps
Who
does
think
setting
his
own
with
his
filthy
white
badges
They
might
agree
with
with
Grish
nakh
their
trusted
messenger
and
Grishnakh
say
this
Saruman
fool
and
dirty
treacherous
fool
But
the
Great

Swine
How
you
folk

being
called

the
muck

dirty
little

orc
flesh

Pll
warrant
Many
loud
yells
orc
speech
answered
him
and
the
ringing
clash
weapons
being
drawn
Cautiously
Pippin
rolled
over
hoping
see
what
would
happen
His
guards
had
gone
join
the
fray
THE
URUK
HAI
447
the
twilight
saw
large
black
Orc
probably
Ugluk
standing
facing
Grishnakh
short
crook
legged
creature
very
broad
and
with
long
arms
that
hung
almost
the
ground
Round
them
were
many
smaller
goblins
Pippin
supposed
that
these
were
the
ones
from
the
North
They
had
drawn
their
knives
and
swords
but
hesitated
attack
Ugluk
Ugluk
shouted
and
number
other
Orcs
nearly
his
own
size
ran
Then
suddenly
without
warning
Ugluk
sprang
forwards
and
with
two
swift
strokes
swept
the
heads
off
two
his
opponents
Grishnakh
stepped
aside
and
vanished
into
the
shadows
The
others
gave
way
and
one
stepped
backwards
and
fell
over
Merry
prostrate
form
with
curse
Yet
that
probably
saved
his
life
for
Ugluk
fol
lowers
leaped
over
him
and
cut
down
another
with
their
broad
bladed
swords
was
the
yellow
fanged
guard
His
body
fell
right
top
Pippin
still
clutching
its
long
saw
edged
knife
Put
your
weapons
shouted
Ugluk
And
let
have
more
nonsense
straight
west
from
here
and
down
the
stair
From
there
straight
the
downs
then
along
the
river
the
forest
And
march
day
and
night
That
clear
Now
thought
Pippin
only
takes
that
ugly
fellow
little
while
get
his
troop
under
control
got
chance
gleam
hope
had
come
him
The
edge
the
black
knife
had
snicked
his
arm
and
then
slid
down
his
wrist
felt
the
blood
trickling
his
hand
but
also
felt
the
cold
touch
steel
against
his
skin
The
Orcs
were
getting
ready
march
again
but
some
the
Northerners
were
still
unwilling
and
the
Isengarders
slew
two
more
before
the
rest
were
cowed
There
was
much
cursing
and
confusion
For
the
moment
Pippin
was
unwatched
His
legs
were
securely
bound
but
his
arms
were
only
tied
about
the
wrists
and
his
hands
were
front
him
could
move
them
both
together
though
the
bonds
were
cruelly
tight
pushed
the
dead
Orc
one
side
then
hardly
daring
breathe
drew
the
knot
the
wrist
cord
and
down
against
the
blade
the
knife
was
sharp
and
the
dead
hand
held
fast
The
cord
was
cut
Quickly
Pippin
took
his
fingers
and
knotted
again
into
loose
bracelet
two
loops
and
slipped
over
his
hands
Then
lay
very
still
Pick
those
prisoners
shouted
Ugluk
Don
play
any
tricks
with
them
they
are
not
alive
when
get
back
someone
else
will
die
too
Orc
seized
Pippin
like
sack
put
its
head
between
his
tied
hands
grabbed
his
arms
and
dragged
them
down
until
Pippin
face
was
crushed
against
its
neck
then
jolted
off
with
him
Another
448
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
treated
Merry
the
same
way
The
Orc
clawlike
hand
gripped
Pippin
arms
like
iron
the
nails
bit
into
him
shut
his
eyes
and
slipped
back
into
evil
dreams
Suddenly
was
thrown
the
stony
floor
again
was
early
night
but
the
slim
moon
was
already
falling
westward
They
were
the
edge
cliff
that
seemed
look
out
over
sea
pale
mist
There
was
sound
water
falling
nearby
The
scouts
have
come
back
last
said
Orc
close
hand
Well
what
did
you
discover
growled
the
voice
Ugluk
Only
single
horseman
and
made
off
westwards
All
clear
now
Now
daresay
But
how
long
You
fools
You
should
have
shot
him
raise
the
alarm
The
cursed
horsebreeders
will
hear
morning
Now
have
leg
double
quick
shadow
bent
over
Pippin
was
Ugluk
Sit
said
the
Orc
lads
are
tired
lugging
you
about
have
got
climb
down
and
you
must
use
your
legs
helpful
now
crying
out
trying
escape
have
ways
paying
for
tricks
that
you
won
like
though
they
won
spoil
your
usefulness
for
the
Master
cut
the
thongs
round
Pippin
legs
and
ankles
picked
him
his
hair
and
stood
him
his
feet
Pippin
fell
down
and
Uglik
dragged
him
his
hair
again
Several
Orcs
laughed
Ugluk
thrust
flask
between
his
teeth
and
poured
some
burning
liquid
down
his
throat
felt
hot
fierce
glow
flow
through
him
The
pain
his
legs
and
ankles
vanished
could
stand
Now
for
the
other
said
Ugluk
Pippin
saw
him
Merry
who
was
lying
close
and
kick
him
Merry
groaned
Seizing
him
roughly
Ugluk
pulled
him
into
sitting
position
and
tore
the
bandage
off
his
head
Then
smeared
the
wound
with
some
dark
stuff
out
small
wooden
box
Merry
cried
out
and
struggled
wildly
The
Orcs
clapped
and
hooted
Can
take
his
medicine
they
jeered
Doesn
know
what
good
for
him
shall
have
some
fun
later
But
the
moment
Ugluk
was
not
engaged
sport
needed
speed
and
had
humour
unwilling
followers
was
healing
Merry
orc
fashion
and
his
treatment
worked
swiftly
When
had
forced
drink
from
his
flask
down
the
hobbit
throat
cut
his
leg
bonds
and
dragged
him
his
feet
Merry
stood
looking
pale
but
grim
and
defiant
and
very
much
alive
The
gash
his
forehead
gave
him
more
trouble
but
bore
brown
scar
the
end
his
days
Hullo
Pippin
said
you
come
this
little
expedition
too
Where
get
bed
and
breakfast
Now
then
said
Ugluk
None
that
Hold
your
tongues
THE
URUK
HAI
449
talk
one
another
Any
trouble
will
reported
the
other
end
and
know
how
pay
you
You
get
bed
and
breakfast
all
right
more
than
you
can
stomach
The
orc
band
began
descend
narrow
ravine
leading
down
into
the
misty
plain
below
Merry
and
Pippin
separated
dozen
Orcs
more
climbed
down
with
them
the
bottom
they
stepped
grass
and
the
hearts
the
hobbits
rose
Now
straight
shouted
Ugluk
West
and
little
north
Follow
Lugdush
But
what
are
going
sunrise
said
some
the
North
erners
running
said
Ugluk
What
you
think
Sit
the
grass
and
wait
for
the
Whiteskins
join
the
picnic
But
can
run
the
sunlight
You
run
with
behind
you
said
Ugluk
Run
you
never
see
your
beloved
holes
again
the
White
Hand
What
the
use
sending
out
mountain
maggots
trip
only
half
trained
Run
curse
you
Run
while
night
lasts
Then
the
whole
company
began
run
with
the
long
loping
strides
Orcs
They
kept
order
thrusting
jostling
and
cursing
yet
their
speed
was
very
great
Each
hobbit
had
guard
three
Pippin
was
far
back
the
line
wondered
how
long
would
able
this
pace
had
had
food
since
the
morning
One
his
guards
had
whip
But
present
the
orc
liquor
was
still
hot
him
His
wits
too
were
wide
awake
Every
now
and
again
there
came
into
his
mind
unbidden
vision
the
keen
face
Strider
bending
over
dark
trail
and
running
running
behind
But
what
could
even
Ranger
see
except
confused
trail
orc
feet
His
own
little
prints
and
Merry
were
overwhelmed
the
trampling
the
iron
shod
shoes
before
them
and
behind
them
and
about
them
They
had
gone
only
mile
from
the
cliff
when
the
land
sloped
down
into
wide
shallow
depression
where
the
ground
was
soft
and
wet
Mist
lay
there
pale
glimmering
the
last
rays
the
sickle
moon
The
dark
shapes
the
Orcs
front
grew
dim
and
then
were
swallowed
Steady
now
shouted
Ugluk
from
the
rear
sudden
thought
leaped
into
Pippin
mind
and
acted
once
swerved
aside
the
right
and
dived
out
the
reach
his
clutching
guard
headfirst
into
the
mist
landed
sprawling
the
grass
Halt
yelled
Ugluk
There
was
for
moment
turmoil
and
confusion
Pippin
sprang
450
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
and
ran
But
the
Orcs
were
after
him
Some
suddenly
loomed
right
front
him
hope
escape
thought
Pippin
But
there
hope
that
have
left
some
own
marks
unspoilt
the
wet
ground
groped
with
his
two
tied
hands
his
throat
and
unclasped
the
brooch
his
cloak
Just
long
arms
and
hard
claws
seized
him
let
fall
There
suppose
will
lie
until
the
end
time
thought
don
know
why
did
the
others
have
escaped
they
probably
all
gone
with
Frodo
whip
thong
curled
round
his
legs
and
stifled
cry
Enough
shouted
Ugluk
running
still
got
run
long
way
yet
Make
both
run
Just
use
the
whip
reminder
But
that
not
all
snarled
turning
Pippin
shan
forget
Payment
only
put
off
Leg
Neither
Pippin
nor
Merry
remembered
much
the
later
part
the
journey
Evil
dreams
and
evil
waking
were
blended
into
long
tunnel
misery
with
hope
growing
ever
fainter
behind
They
ran
and
they
ran
striving
keep
the
pace
set
the
Orcs
licked
every
now
and
again
with
cruel
thong
cunningly
handled
they
halted
stumbled
they
were
seized
and
dragged
for
some
distance
The
warmth
the
orc
draught
had
gone
Pippin
felt
cold
and
sick
again
Suddenly
fell
face
downward
the
turf
Hard
hands
with
rending
nails
gripped
and
lifted
him
was
carried
like
sack
once
more
and
darkness
grew
about
him
whether
the
darkness
another
night
blindness
his
eyes
could
not
tell
Dimly
became
aware
voices
clamouring
seemed
that
many
the
Orcs
were
demanding
halt
Ugluk
was
shouting
felt
himself
flung
the
ground
and
lay
fell
till
black
dreams
took
him
But
did
not
long
escape
from
pain
soon
the
iron
grip
merciless
hands
was
him
again
For
long
time
was
tossed
and
shaken
and
then
slowly
the
darkness
gave
way
and
came
back
the
waking
world
and
found
that
was
morning
Orders
were
shouted
and
was
thrown
roughly
the
grass
There
lay
for
while
fighting
with
despair
His
head
swam
but
from
the
heat
his
body
guessed
that
had
been
given
another
draught
Orc
stooped
over
him
and
flung
him
some
bread
and
strip
raw
dried
flesh
ate
the
stale
grey
bread
hungrily
but
not
the
meat
was
famished
but
not
yet
famished
eat
flesh
flung
him
Orc
the
flesh
dared
not
guess
what
creature
sat
and
looked
about
Merry
was
not
far
away
They
were
the
banks
swift
narrow
river
Ahead
mountains
loomed
tall
peak
was
catching
the
first
rays
the
sun
dark
smudge
forest
lay
the
lower
slopes
before
them
THE
URUK
HAI
451
There
was
much
shouting
and
debating
among
the
Orcs
quarrel
seemed
the
point
breaking
out
again
between
the
Northerners
and
the
Isengarders
Some
were
pointing
back
away
south
and
some
were
pointing
eastward
Very
well
said
Ugluk
Leave
them
then
killing
told
you
before
but
you
want
throw
away
what
come
all
the
way
get
throw
away
Ill
look
after
Let
the
fighting
Uruk
hai
the
work
usual
you
afraid
the
Whiteskins
run
Run
There
the
forest
shouted
pointing
ahead
Get
your
best
hope
Off
you
And
quick
before
knock
few
more
heads
off
put
some
sense
into
the
others
There
was
some
cursing
and
scuffling
and
then
most
the
North
erners
broke
away
and
dashed
off
over
hundred
them
running
wildly
along
the
river
towards
the
mountains
The
hobbits
were
left
with
the
Isengarders
grim
dark
band
four
score
least
large
swart
slant
eyed
Orcs
with
great
bows
and
short
broad
bladed
swords
few
the
larger
and
bolder
Northerners
remained
with
them
Now
deal
with
Grishnakh
said
Ugluk
but
some
even
his
own
followers
were
looking
uneasily
southwards
know
growled
Ugluk
The
cursed
horse
boys
have
got
wind
But
that
all
your
fault
Snaga
You
and
the
other
scouts
ought
have
your
ears
cut
off
But
are
the
fighters
feast
horseflesh
yet
something
better
that
moment
Pippin
saw
why
some
the
troop
had
been
pointing
eastward
From
that
direction
there
now
came
hoarse
cries
and
there
was
Grishnakh
again
and
his
back
couple
score
others
like
him
long
armed
crook
legged
Orcs
They
had
red
eye
painted
their
shields
Uglik
stepped
forward
meet
them
you
come
back
said
Thought
better
returned
see
that
Orders
are
carried
out
and
the
prisoners
safe
answered
Grishnakh
Indeed
said
Ugluk
Waste
effort
see
that
orders
are
carried
out
command
And
what
else
did
you
come
back
for
You
went
hurry
Did
you
leave
anything
behind
left
fool
snarled
Grishnakh
But
there
were
some
stout
fellows
with
him
that
are
too
good
lose
knew
you
lead
them
into
mess
Pve
come
help
them
Splendid
laughed
Ugluk
But
unless
you
got
some
guts
for
fighting
you
taken
the
wrong
way
Lugburz
was
your
road
The
Whiteskins
are
coming
What
happened
your
precious
Nazgtl
Has
had
another
mount
shot
under
him
Now
you
brought
him
along
that
might
have
been
useful
these
Nazgul
are
all
they
make
out
452
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Nazgiil
Nazgiil
said
Grishnakh
shivering
and
licking
his
lips
the
word
had
foul
taste
that
savoured
painfully
You
speak
what
deep
beyond
the
reach
your
muddy
dreams
Ugluk
said
Nazgil
All
that
they
make
out
One
day
you
wish
that
you
had
not
said
that
Ape
snarled
fiercely
You
ought
know
that
they
the
apple
the
Great
Eye
But
the
winged
Nazgil
not
yet
not
yet
won
let
them
show
themselves
across
the
Great
River
yet
not
too
soon
They
for
the
War
and
other
purposes
You
seem
know
lot
said
Ugluk
More
than
good
for
you
guess
Perhaps
those
Lugburz
might
wonder
how
and
why
But
the
meantime
the
Uruk
hai
Isengard
can
the
dirty
work
usual
Don
stand
slavering
there
Get
your
rabble
together
The
other
swine
are
legging
the
forest
You
better
follow
You
wouldn
get
back
the
Great
River
alive
Right
off
the
mark
Now
your
heels
The
Isengarders
seized
Merry
and
Pippin
again
and
slung
them
their
backs
Then
the
troop
started
off
Hour
after
hour
they
ran
pausing
now
and
again
only
sling
the
hobbits
fresh
carriers
Either
because
they
were
quicker
and
hardier
because
some
plan
Grishnakh
the
Isengarders
gradually
passed
through
the
Orcs
Mordor
and
Grishnakh
folk
closed
behind
Soon
they
were
gaining
also
the
Northerners
ahead
The
forest
began
draw
nearer
Pippin
was
bruised
and
torn
his
aching
head
was
grated
the
filthy
jowl
and
hairy
ear
the
Orc
that
held
him
Immediately
front
were
bowed
backs
and
tough
thick
legs
going
and
down
and
down
unresting
they
were
made
wire
and
horn
beating
out
the
nightmare
seconds
endless
time
the
afternoon
Ugluk
troop
overtook
the
Northerners
They
were
flagging
the
rays
the
bright
sun
winter
sun
shining
pale
cool
sky
though
was
their
heads
were
down
and
their
tongues
lolling
out
Maggots
jeered
the
Isengarders
You
cooked
The
Whiteskins
will
catch
you
and
eat
you
They
coming
cry
from
Grishnakh
showed
that
this
was
not
mere
jest
Horse
men
riding
very
swiftly
had
indeed
been
sighted
still
far
behind
but
gaining
the
Orcs
gaining
them
like
tide
over
the
flats
folk
straying
quicksand
The
Isengarders
began
run
with
redoubled
pace
that
aston
ished
Pippin
terrific
spurt
seemed
for
the
end
race
Then
saw
that
the
sun
was
sinking
falling
behind
the
Misty
Mountains
shadows
reached
over
the
land
The
soldiers
Mordor
lifted
their
THE
URUK
HAI
453
heads
and
also
began
put
speed
The
forest
was
dark
and
close
Already
they
had
passed
few
outlying
trees
The
land
was
beginning
slope
upwards
ever
more
steeply
but
the
Orcs
did
not
halt
Both
Uglik
and
Grishnakh
shouted
spurring
them
last
effort
They
will
make
yet
They
will
escape
thought
Pippin
And
then
managed
twist
his
neck
glance
back
with
one
eye
over
his
shoulder
saw
that
riders
away
eastward
were
already
level
with
the
Orcs
galloping
over
the
plain
The
sunset
gilded
their
spears
and
helmets
and
glinted
their
pale
flowing
hair
They
were
hemming
the
Orcs
preventing
them
from
scattering
and
driving
them
along
the
line
the
river
wondered
very
much
what
kind
folk
they
were
wished
now
that
had
learned
more
Rivendell
and
looked
more
maps
and
things
but
those
days
the
plans
for
the
journey
seemed
more
competent
hands
and
had
never
reckoned
with
being
cut
off
from
Gandalf
from
Strider
and
even
from
Frodo
All
that
could
remember
about
Rohan
was
that
Gandalf
horse
Shadowfax
had
come
from
that
land
That
sounded
hopeful
far
went
But
how
will
they
know
that
are
not
Orcs
thought
don
suppose
they
ever
heard
hobbits
down
here
suppose
ought
glad
that
the
beastly
Orcs
look
like
being
destroyed
but
would
rather
saved
myself
The
chances
were
that
and
Merry
would
killed
together
with
their
captors
before
ever
the
Men
Rohan
were
aware
them
few
the
riders
appeared
bowmen
skilled
shooting
from
running
horse
Riding
swiftly
into
range
they
shot
arrows
the
Orcs
that
straggled
behind
and
several
them
fell
then
the
riders
wheeled
away
out
the
range
the
answering
bows
their
enemies
who
shot
wildly
not
daring
halt
This
happened
many
times
and
one
occasion
arrows
fell
among
the
Isengarders
One
them
just
front
Pippin
stumbled
and
did
not
get
again
Night
came
down
without
the
Riders
closing
for
battle
Many
Orcs
had
fallen
but
fully
two
hundred
remained
the
early
darkness
the
Orcs
came
hillock
The
eaves
the
forest
were
very
near
prob
ably
more
than
three
furlongs
away
but
they
could
further
The
horsemen
had
encircled
them
small
band
disobeyed
Ugluk
command
and
ran
towards
the
forest
only
three
returned
Well
here
are
sneered
Grishnakh
Fine
leadership
hope
the
great
Ugluk
will
lead
out
again
Put
those
Halflings
down
ordered
Ugluk
taking
notice
Grishnakh
You
Lugdush
get
two
others
and
stand
guard
over
them
They
not
killed
unless
the
filthy
Whiteskins
break
454
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
through
Understand
long
alive
want
But
they
not
cry
out
and
they
not
rescued
Bind
their
legs
The
last
part
the
order
was
carried
out
mercilessly
But
Pippin
found
that
for
the
first
time
was
close
Merry
The
Orcs
were
making
great
deal
noise
shouting
and
clashing
their
weapons
and
the
hobbits
managed
whisper
together
for
while
don
think
much
this
said
Merry
feel
nearly
done
Don
think
could
crawl
away
far
even
was
free
Lembas
whispered
Pippin
Lembas
got
some
Have
you
don
think
they
taken
anything
but
our
swords
Yes
had
packet
pocket
answered
Merry
but
must
battered
crumbs
Anyway
can
put
mouth
pocket
You
won
have
but
just
then
savage
kick
warned
Pippin
that
the
noise
had
died
down
and
the
guards
were
watchful
The
night
was
cold
and
still
All
round
the
knoll
which
the
Orcs
were
gathered
little
watch
fires
sprang
golden
red
the
darkness
complete
ring
them
They
were
within
long
bowshot
but
the
riders
did
not
show
themselves
against
the
light
and
the
Orcs
wasted
many
arrows
shooting
the
fires
until
Uglik
stopped
them
The
riders
made
sound
Later
the
night
when
the
moon
came
out
the
mist
then
occasionally
they
could
seen
shadowy
shapes
that
glinted
now
and
again
the
white
light
they
moved
ceaseless
patrol
They
wait
for
the
Sun
curse
them
growled
one
the
guards
Why
don
get
together
and
charge
through
What
old
Uglik
think
doing
should
like
know
daresay
you
would
snarled
Ugluk
stepping
from
behind
Meaning
don
think
all
Curse
you
You
bad
the
other
rabble
the
maggots
and
the
apes
Lugburz
good
trying
charge
with
them
They
just
squeal
and
bolt
and
there
are
more
than
enough
these
filthy
horse
boys
mop
our
lot
the
flat
There
only
one
thing
those
maggots
can
they
can
see
like
gimlets
the
dark
But
these
Whiteskins
have
better
night
eyes
than
most
Men
from
all
heard
and
don
forget
their
horses
They
can
see
the
night
breeze
said
Still
there
one
thing
the
fine
fellows
don
know
Mauhur
and
his
lads
are
the
forest
and
they
should
turn
any
time
now
Ugluk
words
were
enough
apparently
satisfy
the
Isengarders
but
the
other
Orcs
were
both
dispirited
and
rebellious
They
posted
few
watchers
but
most
them
lay
the
ground
resting
the
pleasant
darkness
did
indeed
become
very
dark
again
for
the
moon
passed
westward
into
thick
cloud
and
Pippin
could
not
see
THE
URUK
HAI
455
anything
few
feet
away
The
fires
brought
light
the
hillock
The
riders
were
not
however
content
merely
wait
for
the
dawn
and
let
their
enemies
rest
sudden
outcry
the
east
side
the
knoll
showed
that
something
was
wrong
seemed
that
some
the
Men
had
ridden
close
slipped
off
their
horses
crawled
the
edge
the
camp
and
killed
several
Orcs
and
then
had
faded
away
again
Ugluk
dashed
off
stop
stampede
Pippin
and
Merry
sat
Their
guards
Isengarders
had
gone
with
Ugluk
But
the
hobbits
had
any
thought
escape
was
soon
dashed
long
hairy
arm
took
each
them
the
neck
and
drew
them
close
together
Dimly
they
were
aware
Grishnakh
great
head
and
hideous
face
between
them
his
foul
breath
was
their
cheeks
began
paw
them
and
feel
them
Pippin
shuddered
hard
cold
fingers
groped
down
his
back
Well
little
ones
said
Grishnakh
soft
whisper
Enjoying
your
nice
rest
not
little
awkwardly
placed
perhaps
swords
and
whips
one
side
and
nasty
spears
the
other
Little
people
should
not
meddle
affairs
that
are
too
big
for
them
His
fingers
continued
grope
There
was
light
like
pale
but
hot
fire
behind
his
eyes
The
thought
came
suddenly
into
Pippin
mind
caught
direct
from
the
urgent
thought
his
enemy
Grishnakh
knows
about
the
Ring
looking
for
while
Ugluk
busy
probably
wants
for
himself
Cold
fear
was
Pippin
heart
yet
the
same
time
was
wondering
what
use
could
make
Grishnakh
desire
don
think
you
will
find
that
way
whispered
isn
easy
find
Find
said
Grishnakh
his
fingers
stopped
crawling
and
gripped
Pippin
shoulder
Find
what
What
are
you
talking
about
little
one
For
moment
Pippin
was
silent
Then
suddenly
the
darkness
made
noise
his
throat
gollum
gollum
Nothing
precious
added
The
hobbits
felt
Grishnakh
fingers
twitch
hissed
the
goblin
softly
That
what
means
Very
danger
ous
little
ones
Perhaps
said
Merry
now
alert
and
aware
Pippin
guess
Perhaps
and
not
only
for
Still
you
know
your
own
business
best
you
want
not
And
what
would
you
give
for
want
want
said
Grishnakh
puzzled
but
his
arms
were
trembling
What
would
give
for
What
you
mean
mean
said
Pippin
choosing
his
words
carefully
that
good
groping
the
dark
could
save
you
time
and
trouble
But
456
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
you
must
untie
our
legs
first
nothing
and
say
nothing
dear
tender
little
fools
hissed
Grishnakh
everything
you
have
and
everything
you
know
will
got
out
you
due
time
everything
You
wish
there
was
more
that
you
could
tell
satisfy
the
Questioner
indeed
you
will
quite
soon
shan
hurry
the
enquiry
dear
What
you
think
you
been
kept
alive
for
dear
little
fellows
please
believe
when
say
that
was
not
out
kindness
that
not
even
one
Ugluk
faults
find
quite
easy
believe
said
Merry
But
you
haven
got
your
prey
home
yet
And
doesn
seem
going
your
way
whatever
happens
come
Isengard
won
the
great
Grishnakh
that
benefits
Saruman
will
take
all
that
can
find
you
want
anything
for
yourself
now
the
time
deal
Grishnakh
began
lose
his
temper
The
name
Sar
uman
seemed
specially
enrage
him
Time
was
passing
and
the
disturbance
was
dying
down
Ugluk
the
Isengarders
might
return
any
minute
Have
you
got
either
your
snarled
Gollum
gollum
said
Pippin
Untie
our
legs
said
Merry
They
felt
the
Orc
arms
trembling
violently
Curse
you
you
filthy
little
vermin
hissed
Untie
your
legs
untie
every
string
your
bodies
you
think
can
search
you
the
bones
Search
you
Pll
cut
you
both
quivering
shreds
don
need
the
help
your
legs
get
you
away
and
have
you
all
myself
Suddenly
seized
them
The
strength
his
long
arms
and
shoul
ders
was
terrifying
tucked
them
one
under
each
armpit
and
crushed
them
fiercely
his
sides
great
stifling
hand
was
clapped
over
each
their
mouths
Then
sprang
forward
stooping
low
Quickly
and
silently
went
until
came
the
edge
the
knoll
There
choosing
gap
between
the
watchers
passed
like
evil
shadow
out
into
the
night
down
the
slope
and
away
westward
towards
the
river
that
flowed
out
the
forest
that
direction
there
was
wide
open
space
with
only
one
fire
After
going
dozen
yards
halted
peering
and
listening
Nothing
could
seen
heard
crept
slowly
bent
almost
double
Then
squatted
and
listened
again
Then
stood
risk
sudden
dash
that
very
moment
the
dark
form
rider
loomed
right
front
him
horse
snorted

Grishnakh
flung
himself
the

the

under
him
then
drew
his
sword

meant
kill
his
captives
rather
than
allow
them

but
was
his
undoing
The
sword
rang
faintly
and
glinted

the
light
the
fire
away
his
left
arrow
came
whistling

gloom
was
aimed
with
skill
guided
fate
and
pierced
his
right
hand
dropped
the
sword
and
shrieked
There
was
quick
beat
hoofs
and
even
Grishnakh
leaped
and
ran
was
ridden
down
and
spear
passed
through
him
gave
hideous
shivering
cry
and
lay
still
The
hobbits
remained
flat
the
ground
Grishnakh
had
left
them
Another
horseman
came
riding
swiftly
his
comrade
aid
Whether
because
some
special
keenness
sight
because
some
other
sense
the
horse
lifted
and
sprang
lightly
over
them
but
its
rider
did
not
see
them
lying
covered
their
elven
cloaks
too
crushed
for
the
moment
and
too
afraid
move
last
Merry
stirred
and
whispered
softly
far
good
but
how
are
avoid
being
spitted
The
answer
came
almost
immediately
The
cries
Grishnakh
had
roused
the
Orcs
From
the
yells
and
screeches
that
came
from
the
knoll
the
hobbits
guessed
that
their
disappearance
had
been
dis
covered
Ugluk
was
probably
knocking
off
few
more
heads
Then
suddenly
the
answering
cries
orc
voices
came
from
the
right
out
side
the
circle
watch
fires
from
the
direction
the
forest
and
the
mountains
Mauhtr
had
apparently
arrived
and
was
attacking
the
besiegers
There
was
the
sound
galloping
horses
The
Riders
were
drawing
their
ring
close
round
the
knoll
risking
the
orc
arrows
prevent
any
sortie
while
company
rode
off
deal
with
the
newcomers
Suddenly
Merry
and
Pippin
realized
that
without
moving
they
were
now
outside
the
circle
there
was
nothing
between
them
and
escape
Now
said
Merry
only
had
our
legs
and
hands
free
might
get
away
But
can
touch
the
knots
and
can
bite
them
need
try
said
Pippin
was
going
tell
you
managed
free
hands
These
loops
are
only
left
for
show
You
better
have
bit
embas
first
slipped
the
cords
off
his
wrists
and
fished
out
packet
The
cakes
were
broken
but
good
still
their
leaf
wrappings
The
hobbits
each
ate
two
three
pieces
The
taste
brought
back
them
the
memory
fair
faces
and
laughter
and
wholesome
food
quiet
days
now
far
away
For
while
they
ate
thoughtfully
sitting
the
dark
heedless
the
cries
and
sounds
battle
nearby
Pippin
was
the
first
come
back
the
present
must
off
said
Half
moment
Grishnakh
sword
was
lying
close
hand
but
was
too
heavy
and
clumsy
for
him
use
crawled
forward
and
finding
the
body
the
goblin
drew
from
its
sheath
long
sharp
knife
With
this
quickly
cut
their
bonds

THE

Now
for
said
When
warmed
bit
perhaps
shall
able
stand
again
and
walk
But
any
case
had
better
start
crawling
They
crawled
The
turf
was
deep
and
yielding
and
that
helped
them
but
seemed
long
slow
business
They
gave
the
watch
fire
wide
berth
and
wormed
their
way
forward
bit
bit
until
they
came
the
edge
the
river
gurgling
away
the
black
shadows
under
its
deep
banks
Then
they
looked
back
The
sounds
had
died
away
Evidently
Mauhur
and
his
lads
had
been
killed
driven
off
The
Riders
had
returned
their
silent
ominous
vigil
would
not
last
very
much
longer
Already
the
night
was
old
the
East
which
had
remained
unclouded
the
sky
was
beginning
grow
pale
must
get
under
cover
said
Pippin
shall
seen
will
not
any
comfort
these
riders
discover
that
are
not
Orcs
after
are
dead
got
and
stamped
his
feet
Those
cords
have
cut
like
wires
but
feet
are
getting
warm
again
could
stagger
now
What
about
you
Merry
Merry
got
Yes
said

manage
Lembas
does
put
heart
into
you
more
wholesome
sort
feeling
too
than
the
heat
that

draught
wonder
what
was
made
Better
not

expect
Let
get

water
wash
away
the
thought
Not
here
the
banks
are
too
steep
said
Pippin
Forward
now
They
turned
and
walked
side
side
slowly
along
the
line
the
river
Behind
them
the
light
grew
the
East
they
walked
they
compared
notes
talking
lightly
hobbit
fashion
the
things
that
had
happened
since
their
capture
listener
would
have
guessed
from
their
words
that
they
had
suffered
cruelly
and
been
dire
peril
going
without
hope
towards
torment
and
death
that
even
now
they
knew
well
they
had
little
chance
ever
finding
friend
safety
again
You
seem
have
been
doing
well
Master
Took
said
Merry
You
will
get
almost
chapter
old
Bilbo
book
ever
get
chance
report
him
Good
work
especially
guessing
that
hairy
villain
little
game
and
playing
him
But
wonder
anyone
will
ever
pick
your
trail
and
find
that
brooch
should
hate
lose
mine
but
afraid
yours
gone
for
good
shall
have

with
you
Indeed
Cousin

now
This

you

THE

HAI
459
Even
spoke
the
dark
edge
the
forest
loomed
straight
before
them
Night
seemed
have
taken
refuge
under
its
great
trees
creeping
away
from
the
coming
Dawn
Lead
Master
Brandybuck
said
Pippin
lead
back
have
been
warned
against
Fangorn
But
one
knowing
will
not
have
forgotten
that
have
not
answered
Merry
but
the
forest
seems
better
all
the
same
than
turning
back
into
the
middle
battle
led
the
way
under
the
huge
branches
the
trees
Old
beyond
guessing
they
seemed
Great
trailing
beards
lichen
hung
from
them
blowing
and
swaying
the
breeze
Out
the
shadows
the
hobbits
peeped
gazing
back
down
the
slope
little
furtive
figures
that
the
dim
light
looked
like
elf
children
the
deeps
time
peering
out
the
Wild
Wood
wonder
their
first
Dawn
Far
over
the
Great
River
and
the
Brown
Lands
leagues
upon
grey
leagues
away
the
Dawn
came
red
flame
Loud
rang
the
hunting
horns
greet
The
Riders
Rohan
sprang
suddenly
life
Horn
answered
horn
again
Merry
and
Pippin
heard
clear
the
cold
air
the
neighing
war
horses
and
the
sudden
singing
many
men
The
Sun
limb
was
lifted
arc
fire
above
the
margin
the
world
Then
with
great
cry
the
Riders
charged
from
the
East
the
red
light
gleamed
mail
and
spear
The
Orcs
yelled
and
shot
all
the
arrows
that
remained
them
The
hobbits
saw
several
horsemen
fall
but
their
line
held
the
hill
and
over
and
wheeled
round
and
charged
again
Most
the
raiders
that
were
left
alive
then
broke
and
fled
this
way
and
that
pursued
one
one
the
death
But
one
band
holding
together
black
wedge
drove
forward
resolutely
the
direction
the
forest
Straight
the
slope
they
charged
towards
the
watchers
Now
they
were
drawing
near
and
seemed
certain
that
they
would
escape
they
had
already
hewn
down
three
Riders
that
barred
their
way
have
watched
too
long
said
Merry
There
Ugluk
don
want
meet
him
again
The
hobbits
turned
and
fled
deep
into
the
shadows
the
wood
was
that
they
did
not
see
the
last
stand
when
Ugluk
was
overtaken
and
brought
bay
the
very
edge
Fangorn
There
was
slain
last
Eomer
the
Third
Marshal
the
Mark
who
dismounted
and
fought
him
sword
sword
And
over
the
wide
fields
the
keen
eyed
Riders
hunted
down
the
few
Orcs
that
had
escaped
and
still
had
strength
fly
Then
when
they
had
laid
their
fallen
comrades
mound
and
had
sung
their
praises
the
Riders
made
great
fire
and
scattered
the

ashes
their

ended
the
raid
and
news
came

but
the
smoke
the

rose
high

and

Chapter
TREEBEARD
Meanwhile
the
hobbits
went
with
much
speed
the
dark
and
tangled
forest
allowed
following
the
line
the
running
stream
west
ward
and
towards
the
slopes
the
mountains
deeper
and
deeper
into
Fangorn
Slowly
their
fear
the
Orcs
died
away
and
their
pace
slackened
queer
stifling
feeling
came
over
them
the
air
were
too
thin
too
scanty
for
breathing
last
Merry
halted
can
like
this
panted
want
some
air
Let
have
drink
any
rate
said
Pippin
parched
clambered
great
tree
root
that
wound
down
into
the
stream
and
stooping
drew
some
water
his
cupped
hands
was
clear
and
cold
and
took
many
draughts
Merry
followed
him
The
water
refreshed
them
and
seemed
cheer
their
hearts
for
while
they
sat
together
the
brink
the
stream
dabbling
their
sore
feet
and
legs
and
peering
round
the
trees
that
stood
silently
about
them
rank
upon
rank
until
they
faded
away
into
grey
twilight
every
direction
suppose
you
haven
lost
already
said
Pippin
leaning
back
against
great
tree
trunk
can
least
follow
the
course
this
stream
the
Entwash
whatever
you
call
and
get
out
again
the
way
came
could
our
legs
would
said
Merry
and
could
breathe
properly
Yes
all
very
dim
and
stuffy
here
said
Pippin
reminds
somehow
the
old
room
the
Great
Place
the
Tooks
away
back
the
Smials
Tuckborough
huge
place
where
the
furniture
has
never
been
moved
changed
for
generations
They
say
the
Old
Took
lived
year
after
year
while
and
the
room
got
older
and
shabbier
together
and
has
never
been
changed
since
died
century
ago
And
Old
Gerontius
was
great
great
grandfather
that
puts
back
bit
But
that
nothing
the
old
feeling
this
wood
Look
all
those
weeping
trailing
beards
and
whiskers
lichen
And
most
the
trees
seem
half
covered
with
ragged
dry
leaves
that
have
never
fallen
Untidy
can
imagine
what
spring
would
look
like
here
ever
comes
still
less
spring
cleaning
But
the
Sun
any
rate
must
peep
sometimes
said
Merry
does
not
look
feel
all
like

THE

just

and

tree
ish
You
can
imagine
animals
living
here
all
staying
for
long
nor
hobbits
said
Pippin
And
don
like
the
thought
trying
get
through
either
Nothing
eat
for
hundred
miles
should
guess
How
are
our
supplies
Low
said
Merry
ran
off
with
nothing
but
couple
spare
packets
lembas
and
left
everything
else
behind
They
looked
what
remained
the
elven
cakes
broken
fragments
for
about
five
meagre
days
that
was
all
And
not
wrap
blanket
said
Merry
shall
cold
tonight
whichever
way
Well
better
decide
the
way
now
said
Pippin
The
morning
must
getting
Just
then
they
became
aware
yellow
light
that
had
appeared
some
way
further
into
the
wood
shafts
sunlight
seemed
sud
denly
have
pierced
the
forest
roof
Hullo
said
Merry
The
Sun
must
have
run
into
cloud
while
been
under
these
trees
and
now
she
has
run
out
again
else
she
has
climbed
high
enough
look
down
through
some
opening
isn
far
let
and
investigate
They
found
was
further
than
they
thought
The
ground
was
rising
steeply
still
and
was
becoming
increasingly
stony
The
light
grew
broader
they
went
and
soon
they
saw
that
there
was
rock
wall
before
them
the
side
hill
the
abrupt
end
some
long
root
thrust
out
the
distant
mountains
trees
grew
and
the
sun
was
falling
full
its
stony
face
The
twigs
the
trees
its
foot
were
stretched
out
stiff
and
still
reaching
out
the
warmth
Where
all
had
looked
shabby
and
grey
before
the
wood
now
gleamed
with
rich
browns
and
with
the
smooth
black
greys
bark
like
polished
leather
The
boles
the
trees
glowed
with
soft
green
like
young
grass
early
spring
fleeting
vision
was
about
them
the
face
the
stony
wall
there
was
something
like
stair
natural
perhaps
and
made
the
weathering
and
splitting
the
rock
for
was
rough
and
uneven
High
almost
level
with
the
tops
forest
trees
there
was
shelf
under
cliff
Nothing
grew
there
but
few
grasses
and
weeds
its
edge
and
one
old
stump
tree
with
only
two
bent
branches
left
looked
almost
like
the
figure
some
gnarled
old
man
standing
there
blinking
the
morning
light
said
Merry
joyfully
Now
for
breath
air
and
sight
the
land
They
climbed
and
scrambled
the
rock
the
stair
had
been
made
was
for
bigger
feet
and
longer
legs
than
theirs
They
were
too
eager
surprised
the
remarkable
way
which
the
cuts
TREEBEARD
463
and
sores
their
captivity
had
healed
and
their
vigour
had
returned
They
came
length
the
edge
the
shelf
almost
the
feet
the
old
stump
then
they
sprang
and
turned
round
with
their
backs
the
hill
breathing
deep
and
looking
out
eastward
They
saw
that
they
had
only
come
some
three
four
miles
into
the
forest
the
heads
the
trees
marched
down
the
slopes
towards
the
plain
There
near
the
fringe
the
forest
tall
spires
curling
black
smoke
went
wavering
and
floating
towards
them
The
wind
changing
said
Merry
turned
east
again
feels
cool
here
Yes
said
Pippin
afraid
this
only
passing
gleam
and
will
all
grey
again
What
pity
This
shaggy
old
forest
looked
different
the
sunlight
almost
felt
liked
the
place
Almost
felt
you
liked
the
Forest
That
good
That
uncommonly
kind
you
said
strange
voice
Turn
round
and
let
have
look
your
faces
almost
feel
that
dislike
you
both
but
not
let
hasty
Turn
around
large
knob
knuckled
hand
was
laid
each
their
shoulders
and
they
were
twisted
round
gently
but
irresistibly
then
two
great
arms
lifted
them
They
found
that
they
were
looking
most
extraordinary
face
belonged
large
Man
like
almost
Troll
like
figure
least
fourteen
foot
high
very
sturdy
with
tall
head
and
hardly
any
neck
Whether
was
clad
stuff
like
green
and
grey
bark
whether
that
was
its
hide
was
difficult
say
any
rate
the
arms
short
distance
from
the
trunk
were
not
wrinkled
but
covered
with
brown
smooth
skin
The
large
feet
had
seven
toes
each
The
lower
part
the
long
face
was
covered
with
sweeping
grey
beard
bushy
almost
twiggy
the
roots
thin
and
mossy
the
ends
But
the
moment
the
hobbits
noted
little
but
the
eyes
These
deep
eyes
were
now
surveying
them
slow
and
solemn
but
very
penetrating
They
were
brown
shot
with
green
light
Often
afterwards
Pippin
tried
describe
his
first
impression
them
One
felt
there
was
enormous
well
behind
them
filled
with
ages
memory
and
long
slow
steady
thinking
but
their
surface
was
sparkling
with
the
present
like
sun
shimmering
the
outer
leaves
vast
tree
the
ripples
very
deep
lake
don
know
but
felt
something
that
grew
the
ground
asleep
you
might
say
just
feeling
itself
something
between
root
tip
and
leaf
tip
between
deep
earth
and
sky
had
suddenly
waked
and
was
considering
you
with
the
same
slow
care
that
had
given
its
own
inside
affairs
for
endless
years
Hrum
Hoom
murmured
the
voice
deep
voice
like
very
deep
woodwind
instrument
Very
odd
indeed
not
hasty
that

Pippin
though
still
amazed
longer
felt
afraid
Under
those
eyes
felt
curious
suspense
but
not
fear
Please
said
who
are
you
And
what
are
you
queer
look
came
into
the

the

the

Half

Not

That

sounds
very
right
and
proper
Who
calls
you
hobbits
though
That
does
not
sound
Elvish
Elves
made
all
the
old
words
they
began
Nobody
else
calls
hobbits
call
ourselves
that
said
Pippin
Hoom
hmm
Come
now
Not
hasty
You
call
yourselves
hobbits
But
you
should
not
telling
just
anybody
You
letting

honoured
your

but
you
should
not

all
once
There
are

and
Ents
you

there

not

THE

And
these

down

like

But
not

now
There
quite
lot
going
said
Merry
and
even
tried
quick
would
take
long
time
tell
But
you
told
not
hasty
Ought
tell
you
anything
soon
Would
you
think
rude
asked
what
you
are
going
with
and
which
side
you
are
And
did
you
know
Gandalf
Yes
know
him
the
only
wizard
that
really
cares
about

said
Treebeard
you
know
him
Yes
said
Pippin
sadly
did
was
great
friend
and
was
our
guide
Then
can
answer
your
other
questions
said
Treebeard
not
going
anything
with
you
not
you
mean
that
something
you
without
your
leave
might
some
things
together
don
know
about
sides
own

but
your

may
along
with
mine
for

But
you
speak
Master
Gandalf
was
story
that
had
come
end
Yes
said
Pippin
sadly
The
story
seems
going
but
afraid
Gandalf
has
fallen
out
Hoo
come
now
said
Treebeard
Hoom
well
paused
looking
long
the
hobbits
Hoom
well
not
know
what
say
Come
now
you
would
like
hear
more
said
Merry
will
tell
you
But
will
take
some
time
Wouldn
you
like
put
down
Couldn
sit
here
together
the

while

You
must
getting

not

And
not

there

Merry
Treebeard
repeated
the

Hill
Yes
that

But

for

Never

Let

Where

asked
Merry

Treebeard

You
might

perhaps
But
what
does
that
matter
Well

You

Let
Holding
the
hobbits
gently
but
firmly
one
the
crook
each
arm
Treebeard
lifted
first
one
large
foot
and
then
the
other
and
moved
them
the
edge
the
shelf
The
rootlike
toes
grasped
the
rocks
Then
carefully
and
solemnly
stalked
down
from
step
step
and
reached
the
floor
the
Forest
once
set
off
with
long
deliberate
strides
through
the
trees
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
wood
never
far
from
the
stream
climbing
steadily
towards
the
slopes
the
mountains
Many
the
trees
seemed
asleep
unaware
him
any
other
creature
that
merely
passed
but
some
quivered
and
some
raised
their
branches
above
his
head
approached
All
the
while
walked
talked
himself
long
running
stream
musical
sounds
The
hobbits
were
silent
for
some
time
They
felt
oddly
enough
safe
and
comfortable
and
they
had
great
deal
think
and
wonder
about
last
Pippin
ventured
speak
again
Please
Treebeard
said
could
ask
you
something
Why
did
Celeborn
warn
against
your
forest
told
not
risk
getting
entangled
Hmm
did
now
rumbled
Treebeard
And
might
have
said
much
the
same
you
had
been
going
the
other
way
not
risk
getting
entangled
the
woods
Laurelindorenan
That
what
the
Elves
used
call
but
now
they
make
the
name
shorter
Lothlorien
they
call
Perhaps
they
are
right
maybe
fading
not
growing
Land

that

Now
the

well
But
queer
place
and
not
for

anyone
venture
surprised
that
you
ever
got

but
much
more
surprised
that
you
ever
got
that

And
this

Aye

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
What
you
mean
said
Pippin
What
true
The
trees
and
the
Ents
said
Treebeard
not
understand
all
that
goes
myself
cannot
explain
you
Some
are
still
true
Ents
and
lively
enough
our
fashion
but
many
are
growing
sleepy
going
tree
ish
you
might
say
Most
the
trees
are
just
trees
course
but
many
are
half
awake
Some
are
quite
wide
awake
and
few
are
well
well
getting
Entish
That
going
all
the
time
When
that
happens
tree
you
find
that
some
have
bad
hearts
Nothing
with
their
wood
not
mean
that
Why
knew
some
good
old
willows
down
the
Entwash
gone
long
ago
alas
They
were
quite
hollow
indeed
they
were
falling
all
pieces
but
quiet
and
sweet
spoken
young
leaf
And
then
there
are
some
trees
the
valleys
under
the
mountains
sound
bell
and
bad
right
through
That
sort
thing
seems
spread
There
used
some
very
dangerous
parts
this
country
There
are
still
some
very
black
patches
Like
the
Old
Forest
away
the
north
you
mean
asked
Merry
Aye
aye
something
like
but
much
worse
not
doubt
there
some
shadow
the
Great
Darkness
lying
there
still
away
north
and
bad
memories
are
handed
down
But
there
are
hollow
dales
this
land
where
the
Darkness
has
never
been
lifted
and
the
trees
are
older
than
Still
what
can
keep
off
strangers
and
the
foolhardy
and
train
and
teach
walk
and
weed
are
tree
herds
old
Ents
Few
enough
are
left
now
Sheep
get
like
shepherd
and
shepherds
like
sheep
said
but
slowly
and
neither
have
long
the
world
quicker
and
closer
with
trees
and
Ents
and
they
walk
down
the
ages
together
For
Ents
are
more
like
Elves
less
interested
themselves
than
Men
are
and
better
getting
inside
other
things
And
yet
again
Ents
are
more
like
Men
more
changeable
than
Elves
are
and
quicker
taking
the
colour
the
outside
you
might
say
better
than
both
for
they
are
steadier
and
keep
their
minds
things
longer
Some
kin
look
just
like
trees
now
and
need
something
great
rouse
them
and
they
speak
only
whispers
But
some
trees
are
limb
lithe
and
many
can
talk
Elves
began
course
waking
trees
and
teaching
them
speak
and
learning
their
tree
talk
They
always
wished
talk
everything
the
old
Elves
did
But
then
the
Great
Darkness
came
and
they
passed
away
over
the
Sea
fled
into
far
valleys
and
hid
themselves
and
made
songs
about
days
that
would
never
come
again
Never
again
Aye
aye
there
was
all
one
wood
once
upon
time
from
here
the
Mountains
Lune
and
this
was
just
the
East
End
TREEBEARD
469
Those
were
the
broad
days
Time
was
when
could
walk
and
sing
all
day
and
hear
more
than
the
echo
own
voice
the
hollow
hills
The
woods
were
like
the
woods
Lothlorien
only
thicker
stronger
younger
And
the
smell
the
air
used
spend
week
just
breathing
Treebeard
fell
silent
striding
along
and
yet
making
hardly
sound
with
his
great
feet
Then
began
hum
again
and
passed
into
murmuring
chant
Gradually
the
hobbits
became
aware
that
was
chanting
them
the

ended
and
strode
silently
and
all
the
wood

ear
could
reach
there
was
not
sound
The
day
waned
and
dusk
was
twined
about
the
boles

the

saw

them

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Treebeard
strode
the
slope
hardly
slackening
his
pace
Sud
denly
before
them
the
hobbits
saw
wide
opening
Two
great
trees
stood
there
one
either
side
like
living
gate
posts
but
there
was
gate
save
their
crossing
and
interwoven
boughs
the
old
Ent
approached
the
trees
lifted
their
branches
and
all
their
leaves
quivered
and
rustled
For
they
were
evergreen
trees
and
their
leaves
were
dark
and
polished
and
gleamed
the
twilight
Beyond
them
was
wide
level
space
though
the
floor
great
hall
had
been
cut
the
side
the
hill
either
hand
the
walls
sloped
upwards
until
they
were
fifty
feet
high
more
and
along
each
wall
stood
aisle
trees
that
also
increased
height
they
marched
inwards
the
far
end
the
rock
wall
was
sheer
but
the
bottom
had
been
hollowed
back
into
shallow
bay
with
arched
roof
the
only
roof
the
hall
save
the
branches
the
trees
which
the
inner
end
overshadowed
all
the
ground
leaving
only
broad
open
path
the
middle
little
stream
escaped
from
the
springs
above
and
leav
ing
the
main
water
fell
tinkling
down
the
sheer
face
the
wall
pouring
silver
drops
like
fine
curtain
front
the
arched
bay
The
water
was
gathered
again
into
stone
basin
the
floor
between
the
trees
and
thence
spilled
and
flowed
away
beside
the
open
path
out
rejoin
the
Entwash
its
journey
through
the
forest
Here
are
said
Treebeard
breaking
his
long
silence
have
brought
you
about
seventy
thousand
ent
strides
but
what
that
comes
the
measurement
your
land
not
know
Anyhow
are
near
the
roots
the
Last
Mountain
Part
the
name
this
place
might
Wellinghall
were
turned
into
your
language
like
will
stay
here
tonight
set
them
down
the
grass
between
the
aisles
the
trees
and
they
followed
him
towards
the
great
arch
The
hobbits
now
noticed
that
walked
his
knees
hardly
bent
but
his
legs
opened
great
stride
planted
his
big
toes
and
they
were
indeed
big
and
very
broad
the
ground
first
before
any
other
part
his
feet
For
moment
Treebeard
stood
under
the
rain
the
falling
spring
and
took
deep
breath
then
laughed
and
passed
inside
great
stone
table
stood
there
but
chairs
the
back
the
bay
was
already
quite
dark
Treebeard
lifted
two
great
vessels
and
stood
them
the
table
They
seemed
filled
with
water
but
held
his
hands
over
them
and
immediately
they
began
glow
one
with
golden
and
the
other
with
rich
green
light
and
the
blending
the
two
lights
lit
the
bay
the
sun
summer
was
shining
through
roof
young
leaves
Looking
back
the
hobbits
saw
that
the
trees
the
court
had
also
begun
glow
faintly
first
but
steadily
quicken
ing
until
every
leaf
was
edged
with
light
some
green
some
gold
TREEBEARD
471
some
red
copper
while
the
tree
trunks
looked
like
pillars
moulded
out
luminous
stone
Well
well
now
can
talk
again
said
Treebeard
You
are
thirsty
expect
Perhaps
you
are
also
tired
Drink
this
went
the
back
the
bay
and
then
they
saw
that
several
tall
stone
jars
stood
there
with
heavy
lids
removed
one
the
lids
and
dipped
great
ladle
and
with
filled
three
bowls
one
very
large
bowl
and
two
smaller
ones
This
ent
house
said
and
there
are
seats
fear
But
you
may
sit
the
table
Picking
the
hobbits
set
them
the
great
stone
slab
six
feet
above
the
ground
and
there
they
sat
dangling
their
legs
and
drinking
sips
The
drink
was
like
water
indeed
very
like
the
taste
the
draughts
they
had
drunk
from
the
Entwash
near
the
borders
the
forest
and
yet
there
was
some
scent
savour
which
they
could
not
describe
was
faint
but
reminded
them
the
smell
distant
wood
borne
from
afar
cool
breeze
night
The
effect
the
draught
began
the
toes
and
rose
steadily
through
every
limb
bringing
refreshment
and
vigour
coursed
upwards
right
the
tips
the
hair
Indeed
the
hobbits
felt
that
the
hair
their
heads
was
actually
standing
waving
and
curling
and
growing
for
Treebeard
first
laved
his
feet
the
basin
beyond
the
arch
and
then
drained
his
bowl
one
draught
one
long
slow
draught
The
hobbits
thought
would
never
stop
last
set
the
bowl
down
again
sighed
hoom
now
can
talk
easier
You
can
sit
the
floor
and
will
lie
down
that
will
prevent
this
drink
from
rising
head
and
sending
sleep
the
right
side
the
bay
there
was
great
bed
low
legs
not
more
than
couple
feet
high
covered
deep
dried
grass
and
bracken
Treebeard
lowered
himself
slowly
this
with
only
the
slightest
sign
bending
his
middle
until
lay
full
length
with
his
arms
behind
his
head
looking
the
ceiling
upon
which
lights
were
flickering
like
the
play
leaves
the
sunshine
Merry
and
Pippin
sat
beside
him
pillows
grass
Now
tell
your
tale
and
not
hurry
said
Treebeard
The
hobbits
began
tell
him
the
story
their
adventures
ever
since
they
left
Hobbiton
They
followed
very
clear
order
for
they
interrupted
one
another
continually
and
Treebeard
often
stopped
the
speaker
and
went
back
some
earlier
point
jumped
forward
asking
questions
about
later
events
They
said
nothing
whatever
about
the
Ring
and
did
not
tell
him
why
they
set
out
where
they
were
going
and
did
not
ask
for
any
reasons
472
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
was
immensely
interested
everything
the
Black
Riders
Elrond
and
Rivendell
the
Old
Forest
and
Tom
Bombadil
the
Mines
Moria
and
Lothlorien
and
Galadriel
made
them
describe
the
Shire
and
its
country
over
and
over
again
said
odd
thing
this
point
You
never
see
any
any
Ents
round
there
you
asked
Well
not
Ents
Entwives
should
really
say
Entwives
said
Pippin
Are
they
like
you
all
Yes
well
not
really
know
now
said
Treebeard
thoughtfully
But
they
would
like
your
country
just
wondered
Treebeard
was
however
especially
interested
everything
that
concerned
Gandalf
and
most
interested
all
Saruman
doings
The
hobbits
regretted
very
much
that
they
knew
little
about
them
only
rather
vague
report
Sam
what
Gandalf
had
told
the
Council
But
they
were
clear
any
rate
that
Ugluk
and
his
troop
came
from
Isengard
and
spoke
Saruman
their
master
hoom
said
Treebeard
when
last
their
story
had
wound
and
wandered
down
the
battle
the
Orcs
and
the
Riders
Rohan
Well
well
That
bundle
news
and
mistake
You
have
not
told
all
indeed
not
long
way
But
not
doubt
that
you
are
doing
Gandalf
would
wish
There
something
very
big
going
that
can
see
and
what
maybe
shall
learn
good
time
bad
time
root
and
twig
but
strange
business
sprout
little
folk
that
are
not
the
old
lists
and
behold
the
Nine
forgotten
Riders
reappear
hunt
them
and
Gandalf
takes
them
great
journey
and
Galadriel
harbours
them
Caras
Galadhon
and
Orcs
pursue
them
down
all
the
leagues
Wilderland
indeed
they
seem
caught
great
storm
hope
they
weather
And
what
about
yourself
asked
Merry
Hoom
have
not
troubled
about
the
Great
Wars
said
Treebeard
they
mostly
concern
Elves
and
Men
That
the
business
Wizards
Wizards
are
always
troubled
about
the
future
not
like
worrying
about
the
future
not
altogether
anybody
side
because
nobody
altogether
side
you
understand
nobody
cares
for
the
woods
care
for
them
not
even
Elves
now
adays
Still
take
more
kindly
Elves
than
others
was
the
Elves
that
cured
dumbness
long
ago
and
that
was
great
gift
that
cannot
forgotten
though
our
ways
have
parted
since
And
there
are
some
things
course
whose
side
altogether
against
them
altogether
these
burdrum
again
made
deep
rumble
disgust
these
Orcs
and
their
masters
used
anxious
when
the
shadow
lay
Mirkwood
but
when
removed
Mordor
did
not
trouble
for
while
Mordor

long
way
away
But
seems
that
the
wind
setting
East
and
the
withering
all
woods
may
drawing
near
There
naught
that
old
Ent
can
hold
back
that
storm
must
weather
crack
But
Saruman
now
Saruman
neighbour
cannot
overlook
him
must
something
suppose
have
often
wondered
lately
what
should
about
Saruman
Who
Saruman
asked
Pippin
you
know
anything
about
his
history
Saruman
Wizard
answered
Treebeard
More
than
that
cannot
say
not
know
the
history
Wizards
They
appeared
first
after
the
Great
Ships
came
over
the
Sea
but
they
came
with
the
Ships
never
can
tell
Saruman
was
reckoned
great
among
them
believe
gave
wandering
about
and
minding
the
affairs
Men
and
Elves
some
time
ago
you
would
call
very
long
time
ago
and
settled
down
Angrenost
Isengard
the
Men
Rohan
call
was
very
quiet
begin
with
but
his
fame
began
grow
was
chosen
the
head
the
White
Council
they
say
but
that
did
not
turn
out
too
well
wonder
now
even
then
Saruman
was
not
turning
evil
ways
But
any
rate
used
give
trouble
his
neighbours
used
talk
him
There
was
time
when
was
always
walking
about
woods
was
polite
those
days
always
asking
leave
least
when
met
and
always
eager
listen
told
him
many
things
that
would
never
have
found
out
himself
but
never
repaid
like
kind
cannot
remember
that
ever
told
anything
And
got
more
and
more
like
that
his
face
remember
have
not
seen
for
many
day
became
like
windows
stone
wall
windows
with
shutters
inside
think
that
now
understand
what
plotting
become
Power
has
mind
metal
and
wheels
and
does
not
care
for
growing
things
except
far
they
serve
him
for
the
moment
And
now
clear
that
black
traitor
has
taken
with
foul
folk
with
the
Orcs
Brm
hoom
Worse
than
that
has
been
doing
something
them
something
dangerous
For
these
Isengarders
are
more
like
wicked
Men
mark
evil
things
that
came
the
Great
Darkness
that
they
cannot
abide
the
Sun
but
Saruman
Orcs
can
endure
even
they
hate
wonder
what
has
done
Are
they
Men
has
ruined
has
blended
the
races
Orcs
and
Men
That
would
black
evil
Treebeard
rumbled
for
moment
were
pronouncing
some
deep
subterranean
Entish
malediction
Some
time
ago
began
wonder
how
Orcs
dared
pass
through
woods
freely
went
Only
lately
did
guess
that
Saruman
was
blame
and
474
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
that
long
ago
had
been
spying
out
all
the
ways
and
discovering
secrets
and
his
foul
folk
are
making
havoc
now
Down
the
borders
they
are
felling
trees
good
trees
Some
the
trees
they
just
cut
down
and
leave
rot
orc
mischief
that
but
most
are
hewn
and
carried
off
feed
the
fires
Orthanc
There
always
smoke
rising
from
Isengard
these
days
Curse
him
root
and
branch
Many
those
trees
were
friends
creatures
had
known
from
nut
and
acorn
many
had
voices
their
own
that
are
lost
for
ever
now
And
there
are
wastes
stump
and
bramble
where
once
there
were
singing
groves
have
been
idle
have
let
things
slip
must
stop
Treebeard
raised
himself
from
his
bed
with
jerk
stood
and
thumped
his
hand
the
table
The
vessels
light
trembled
and
sent
two
jets
flame
There
was
flicker
like
green
fire
his
eyes
and
his
beard
stood
out
stiff
great
besom
will
stop
boomed
And
you
shall
come
with
You
may
able
help
You
will
helping
your
own
friends
that
way
too
for
Saruman
not
checked
Rohan
and
Gondor
will
have
enemy
behind
well
front
Our
roads
together
Isengard
will
come
with
you
said
Merry
will
what
can
Yes
said
Pippin
should
like
see
the
White
Hand
overthrown
should
like
there
even
could
not
much
use
shall
never
forget
Ugluk
and
the
crossing
Rohan
Good
Good
said
Treebeard
But
spoke
hastily
must
not
hasty
have
become
too
hot
must
cool
myself
and
think
for
easier
shout
stop
than
strode
the
archway
and
stood
for
some
time
under
the
falling
rain
the
spring
Then
laughed
and
shook
himself
and
wherever
the
drops
water
fell
glittering
from
him
the
ground
they
glinted
like
red
and
green
sparks
came
back
and
laid
himself
the
bed
again
and
was
silent
After
some
time
the
hobbits
heard
him
murmuring
again
seemed
counting
his
fingers
Fangorn
Finglas
Fladrif
aye
aye
sighed
The
trouble
that
there
are
few
left
said
turning
towards
the
hobbits
Only
three
remain
the
first
Ents
that
walked
the
woods
before
the
Darkness
only
myself
Fangorn
and
Finglas
and
Fladrif
give
them
their
Elvish
names
you
may
call
them
Leaflock
and
Skinbark
you
like
that
better
And
three
Leaflock
and
Skinbark
are
not
much
use
for
this
business
Leaflock
has
grown
sleepy
almost
tree
ish
you
might
say
has
taken
standing
himself
half
asleep
all
through
the
summer
with
the
deep
grass
the
meadows
round
his
knees
Covered
with
leafy
TREEBEARD
475
hair
used
rouse
winter
but
late
has
been
too
drowsy
walk
far
even
then
Skinbark
lived
the
mountain
slopes
west
Isengard
That
where
the
worst
trouble
has
been
was
wounded
the
Orcs
and
many
his
folk
and
his
tree
herds
have
been
murdered
and
destroyed
has
gone
into
the
high
places
among
the
birches
that
loves
best
and
will
not
come
down
Still
daresay
could
get
together
fair
company
our
younger
folks
could
make
them
understand
the
need
could
rouse
them
are
not
hasty
folk
What
pity
there
are
few
Why
are
there
few
when
you
have
lived
this
country
long
asked
Pippin
Have
great
many
died
said
Treebeard
None
have
died
from
inside
you
might
say
Some
have
fallen
the
evil
chances
the
long
years
course
and
more
have
grown
tree
ish
But
there
were
never
many
and
have
not
increased
There
have
been
Entings
children
you
would
say
not
for
terrible
long
count
years
You
see
lost
the
Entwives
How
very
sad
said
Pippin
How
was
that
they
all
died
They
did
not
die
said
Treebeard
never
said
died
lost
them
said
lost
them
and
cannot
find
them
sighed
thought
most
folk
knew
that
There
were
songs
about
the
hunt
the
Ents
for
the
Entwives
sung
among
Elves
and
Men
from
Mirkwood
Gondor
They
cannot
quite
forgotten
Well
afraid
the
songs
have
not
come
west
over
the
Moun
tains
the
Shire
said
Merry
Won
you
tell
some
more
sing
one
the
songs
Yes
will
indeed
said
Treebeard
seeming
pleased
with
the
request
But
cannot
tell
properly
only
short
and
then
must
end
our
talk
tomorrow
have
councils
call
and
work
and
maybe
journey
begin
rather
strange
and
sad
story
went
after
pause
When
the
world
was
young
and
the
woods
were
wide
and
wild
the
Ents
and
the
Entwives
and
there
were
Entmaidens
then
the
loveliness
Fimbrethil
Wandlimb
the
lightfooted
the
days
our
youth
they
walked
together
and
they
housed
together
But
our
hearts
did
not
growing
the
same
way
the
Ents
gave
their
love
things
that
they
met
the
world
and
the
Entwives
gave
their
thought
other
things
for
the
Ents
loved
the
great
trees
and
the
wild
woods
and
the
slopes
the
high
hills
and
they
drank
the
mountain
streams
and
ate
only
such
fruit
the
trees
let
fall
their
path
and
they
learned
the
Elves
and
spoke
with
the
Trees
But
the
Entwives
gave
their
minds
the
lesser
trees
and
the
meads
the
sunshine
beyond
the
feet
the
forests
and
they
saw
the
sloe
476
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
the
thicket
and
the
wild
apple
and
the
cherry
blossoming
spring
and
the
green
herbs
the
waterlands
summer
and
the
seeding
grasses
the
autumn
fields
They
did
not
desire
speak
with
these
things
but
they
wished
them
hear
and
obey
what
was
said
them
The
Entwives
ordered
them
grow
according
their
wishes
and
bear
leaf
and
fruit
their
liking
for
the
Entwives
desired
order
and
plenty
and
peace
which
they
meant
that
things
should
remain
where
they
had
set
them
the
Entwives
made
gardens
live
But
Ents
went
wandering
and
only
came
the
gardens
now
and
again
Then
when
the
Darkness
came
the
North
the
Entwives
crossed
the
Great
River
and
made
new
gardens
and
tilled
new
fields
and
saw
them
more
seldom
After
the
Darkness
was
overthrown
the
land
the
Entwives
blossomed
richly
and
their
fields
were
full
corn
Many
men
learned
the
crafts
the
Entwives
and
honoured
them
greatly
but
were
only
legend
them
secret
the
heart
the
forest
Yet
here
still
are
while
all
the
gardens
the
Entwives
are
wasted
Men
call
them
the
Brown
Lands
now
remember
was
long
ago
the
time
the
war
between
Sauron
and
the
Men
the
Sea
desire
came
over
see
Fimbre
thil
again
Very
fair
she
was
still
eyes
when
had
last
seen
her
though
little
like
the
Entmaiden
old
For
the
Entwives
were
bent
and
browned
their
labour
their
hair
parched
the
sun
the
hue
ripe
corn
and
their
cheeks
like
red
apples
Yet
their
eyes
were
still
the
eyes
our
own
people
crossed
over
Anduin
and
came
their
land
but
found
desert
was
all
burned
and
uprooted
for
war
had
passed
over
But
the
Entwives
were
not
there
Long
called
and
long
searched
and
asked
all
folk
that
met
which
way
the
Entwives
had
gone
Some
said
they
had
never
seen
them
and
some
said
that
they
had
seen
them
walking
away
west
and
some
said
east
and
others
south
But
nowhere
that
went
could
find
them
Our
sorrow
was
very
great
Yet
the
wild
wood
called
and
returned
For
many
years
used
out
every
now
and
again
and
look
for
the
Entwives
walking
far
and
wide
and
calling
them
their
beautiful
names
But
time
passed
went
more
seldom
and
wandered
less
far
And
now
the
Entwives
are
only
memory
for
and
our
beards
are
long
and
grey
The
Elves
made
many
songs
concerning
the
Search
the
Ents
and
some
the
songs
passed
into
the
tongues
Men
But
made
songs
about
being
content
chant
their
beautiful
names
when
thought
the
Entwives
believe
that
may
meet
again
time
come
and
perhaps
shall
find
somewhere
land
where
can
live
together
and
both
content
But
foreboded
that
that
will
only
when
have
both
lost
all
that
now
have
And
may
well
that
that
time
drawing
near
last
For
Sauron
TREEBEARD
477
old
destroyed
the
gardens
the
Enemy
today
seems
likely
wither
all
the
woods
There
was
Elvish
song
that
spoke
this
least
understand
used
sung
and
down
the
Great
River
was
never
Entish
song
mark
you
would
have
been
very
long
song
Entish
But
know
heart
and

now
and
again
This

When

Together

Together

into
the
West
And
far
away
will
find
land
where
both
our
hearts
may
rest

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Treebeard
ended
his
song
That
how
goes
said
Elvish
course
lighthearted
quickworded
and
soon
over
daresay
fair
enough
But
the
Ents
could
say
more
their
side
they
had
time
But
now
going
stand
and
take
little
sleep
Where
will
you
stand
usually
lie
down
sleep
said
Merry
shall
all
right
where
are
Lie
down
sleep
said
Treebeard
Why
course
you
hoom
was
forgetting
singing
that
song
put
mind
old
times
almost
thought
that
was
talking
young
Entings
did
Well
you
can
lie
the
bed
going
stand
the
rain
Good
night
Merry
and
Pippin
climbed
the
bed
and
curled
the
soft
grass
and
fern
was
fresh
and
sweet
scented
and
warm
The
lights
died
down
and
the
glow
the
trees
faded
but
outside
under
the
arch
they
could
see
old
Treebeard
standing
motionless
with
his
arms
raised
above
his
head
The
bright
stars
peered
out
the
sky
and
lit
the
falling
water
spilled
his
fingers
and
head
and
dripped
dripped
hundreds
silver
drops
his
feet
Listening
the
tinkling
the
drops
the
hobbits
fell
asleep
They
woke
find
cool
sun
shining
into
the
great
court
and
the
floor
the
bay
Shreds
high
cloud
were
overhead
running
stiff
easterly
wind
Treebeard
was
not
seen
but
while
Merry
and
Pippin
were
bathing
the
basin
the
arch
they
heard
him
humming
and
singing
came
the
path
between
the
trees
Hoo
Good
morning
Merry
and
Pippin
boomed
when
saw
them
You
sleep
long
have
been
many
hundred
strides
already
today
Now
will
have
drink
and
Entmoot
poured
them
out
two
full
bowls
from
stone
jar
but
from
different
jar
The
taste
was
not
the
same
had
been
the
night
before
was
earthier
and
richer
more
sustaining
and
food
like
speak
While
the
hobbits
drank
sitting
the
edge
the
bed
and
nibbling
small
pieces
elf
cake
more
because
they
felt
that
eating
was
necessary
part
breakfast
than
because
they
felt
hungry
Treebeard
stood
humming
Entish
Elvish
some
strange
tongue
and
looking
the
sky
Where
Entmoot
Pippin
ventured
ask
Hoo
Entmoot
said
Treebeard
turning
round
not
place
gathering
Ents
which
does
not
often
happen
nowadays
But
have
managed
make
fair
number
promise
come
shall
meet
the
place
where
have
always
met
Derndingle
Men
call
away
south
from
here
must
there
before
noon
Before
long
they
set
off
Treebeard
carried
the
hobbits
his
arms
TREEBEARD
479
the
previous
day
the
entrance
the
court
turned
the
right
stepped
over
the
stream
and
strode
away
southwards
along
the
feet
great
tumbled
slopes
where
trees
were
scanty
Above
these
the
hobbits
saw
thickets
birch
and
rowan
and
beyond
them
dark
climbing
pinewoods
Soon
Treebeard
turned
little
away
from
the
hills
and
plunged
into
deep
groves
where
the
trees
were
larger
taller
and
thicker
than
any
that
the
hobbits
had
ever
seen
before
For
while
they
felt
faintly
the
sense
stifling
which
they
had
noticed
when
they
first
ventured
into
Fangorn
but
soon
passed
Treebeard
did
not
talk
them
hummed
himself
deeply
and
thoughtfully
but
Merry
and
Pippin
caught
proper
words
sounded
like
boom
boom
rumboom
boorar
boom
boom
dahrar
boom
boom
dahrar
boom
and
with
constant
change
note
and
rhythm
Now
and
again
they
thought
they
heard
answer
hum
quiver
sound
that
seemed
come
out
the
earth
from
boughs
above
their
heads
perhaps
from
the
boles
the
trees
but
Treebeard
did
not
stop
turn
his
head
either
side
They
had
been
going
for
long
while
Pippin
had
tried
keep
count
the
ent
strides
but
had
failed
getting
lost
about
three
thousand
when
Treebeard
began
slacken
his
pace
Suddenly
stopped
put
the
hobbits
down
and
raised
his
curled
hands
his
mouth
that
they
made
hollow
tube
then
blew
called
through
them
great
hoom
hom
rang
out
like
deep
throated
horn
the
woods
and
seemed
echo
from
the
trees
Far
off
there
came
from
several
directions
similar
hoom
hom
hoom
that
was
not
echo
but
answer
Treebeard
now
perched
Merry
and
Pippin
his
shoulders
and
strode
again
every
now
and
then
sending
out
another
horn
call
and
each
time
the
answers
came
louder
and
nearer
this
way
they
came
last
what
looked
like
impenetrable
wall
dark
ever
green
trees
trees
kind
that
the
hobbits
had
never
seen
before
they
branched
out
right
from
the
roots
and
were
densely
clad
dark
glossy
leaves
like
thornless
holly
and
they
bore
many
stiff
upright
flower
spikes
with
large
shining
olive
coloured
buds
Turning
the
left
and
skirting
this
huge
hedge
Treebeard
came
few
strides
narrow
entrance
Through
worn
path
passed
and
dived
suddenly
down
long
steep
slope
The
hobbits
saw
that
they
were
descending
into
great
dingle
almost
round
bowl
very
wide
and
deep
crowned
the
rim
with
the
high
dark
evergreen
hedge
was
smooth
and
grassclad
inside
and
there
were
trees
except
three
very
tall
and
beautiful
silver
birches
that
stood
the
bottom
the
bowl
Two
other
paths
led
down
into
the
dingle
from
the
west
and
from
the
east
480
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Several
Ents
had
already
arrived
More
were
coming
down
the
other
paths
and
some
were
now
following
Treebeard
they
drew
near
the
hobbits
gazed
them
They
had
expected
see
number
creatures
much
like
Treebeard
one
hobbit
like
another
any
rate
stranger
eye
and
they
were
very
much
surprised
see
nothing
the
kind
The
Ents
were
different
from
one
another
trees
from
trees
some
different
one
tree
from
another
the
same
name
but
quite
different
growth
and
history
and
some
different
one
tree
kind
from
another
birch
from
beech
oak
from
fir
There
were
few
older
Ents
bearded
and
gnarled
like
hale
but
ancient
trees
though
none
looked
ancient
Treebeard
and
there
were
tall
strong
Ents
clean
limbed
and
smooth
skinned
like
forest
trees
their
prime
but
there
were
young
Ents
saplings
Altogether
there
were
about
two
dozen
standing
the
wide
grassy
floor
the
dingle
and
many
more
were
marching
first
Merry
and
Pippin
were
struck
chiefly
the
variety
that
they
saw
the
many
shapes
and
colours
the
differences
girth
and
height
and
length
leg
and
arm
and
the
number
toes
and
fingers
anything
from
three
nine
few
seemed
more
less
related
Treebeard
and
reminded
them
beech
trees
oaks
But
there
were
other
kinds
Some
recalled
the
chestnut
brown
skinned
Ents
with
large
splayfingered
hands
and
short
thick
legs
Some
recalled
the
ash
tall
straight
grey
Ents
with
many
fingered
hands
and
long
legs
some
the
fir
the
tallest
Ents
and
others
the
birch
the
rowan
and
the
linden
But
when
the
Ents
all
gathered
round
Tree
beard
bowing
their
heads
slightly
murmuring
their
slow
musical
voices
and
looking
long
and
intently
the
strangers
then
the
hobbits
saw
that
they
were
all
the
same
kindred
and
all
had
the
same
eyes
not
all
old
deep
Treebeard
but
all
with
the
same
slow
steady
thoughtful
expression
and
the
same
green
flicker
soon
the
whole
company
was
assembled
standing
wide
circle
round
Treebeard
curious
and
unintelligible
conversation
began
The
Ents
began
murmur
slowly
first
one
joined
and
then
another
until
they
were
all
chanting
together
long
rising
and
falling
rhythm
now
louder
one
side
the
ring
now
dying
away
there
and
rising
great
boom
the
other
side
Though
could
not
catch
understand
any
the
words
supposed
the
language
was
Entish
Pippin
found
the
sound
very
pleasant
listen
first
but
gradually
his
attention
wavered
After
long
time
and
the
chant
showed
signs
slackening
found
himself
wondering
since
Entish
was
such
unhasty
language
whether
they
had
yet
got
further
than
Good
Morning
and
Treebeard
was
call
the
roll
how
many
days
would
take
sing
all
their
names
wonder
what
the
Entish
for
yes
thought
yawned
TREEBEARD
481
Treebeard
was
immediately
aware
him
hey
Pippin
said
and
the
other
Ents
all
stopped
their
chant
You
are
hasty
folk
was
forgetting
and
anyway
wearisome
listening
speech
you
not
understand
You
may
get
down
now
have
told
your
names
the
Entmoot
and
they
have
seen
you
and
they
have
agreed
that
you
are
not
Orcs
and
that
new
line
shall
put
the
old
lists
have
got
further
yet
but
that
quick
work
for
Entmoot
You
and
Merry
can
stroll
about
the
dingle
you
like
There
well
good
water
you
need
refreshing
away
yonder
the
north
bank
There
are
still
some
words
speak
before
the
Moot
really
begins
will
come
and
see
you
again
and
tell
you
how
things
are
going
put
the
hobbits
down
Before
they
walked
away
they
bowed
low
This
feat
seemed
amuse
the
Ents
very
much
judge
the
tone
their
murmurs
and
the
flicker
their
eyes
but
they
soon
turned
back
their
own
business
Merry
and
Pippin
climbed
the
path
that
came
from
the
west
and
looked
through
the
opening
the
great
hedge
Long
tree
clad
slopes
rose
from
the
lip
the
dingle
and
away
beyond
them
above
the
fir
trees
the
furthest
ridge
there
rose
sharp
and
white
the
peak
high
mountain
Southwards
their
left
they
could
see
the
forest
falling
away
down
into
the
grey
distance
There
far
away
there
was
pale
green
glimmer
that
Merry
guessed
glimpse
the
plains
Rohan
wonder
where
Isengard
said
Pippin
don
know
quite
where
are
said
Merry
but
that
peak
probably
Methedras
and
far
can
remember
the
ring
Isengard
lies
fork
deep
cleft
the
end
the
mountains
probably
down
behind
this
great
ridge
There
seems
smoke
haze
over
there
left
the
peak
don
you
think
What
Isengard
like
said
Pippin
wonder
what
Ents
can
about
anyway
said
Merry

and

the

running
through

out
the
mountains
and
flows
across
the
Gap
Rohan
does
not
seem
the
sort
place
for
Ents
tackle
But
have
odd
feeling
about
these
Ents
somehow
don
think
they
are
quite
safe
and
well
funny
they
seem
They
seem
slow
queer
and
patient
almost
sad
and
yet
believe
they
could
roused
that
happened
would
rather
not
the
other
side
Yes
said
Pippin

what
you

There

THE
LORD
THE

difference
between
old
cow
sitting
and
thoughtfully
chewing
and
bull
charging
and
the
change
might
come
suddenly
wonder
Treebeard
will
rouse
them
sure
means
try
But
they
don
like
being
roused
Treebeard
got
roused
himself
last
night
and
then
bottled
again
The
hobbits
turned
back
The
voices
the
Ents
were
still
rising
and
falling
their
conclave
The
sun
had
now
risen
high
enough
look
over
the
high
hedge
gleamed
the
tops
the
birches
and
lit
the
northward
side
the
dingle
with
cool
yellow
light
There
they
saw
little
glittering
fountain
They
walked
along
the
rim
the
great
bowl
the
feet
the
evergreens
was
pleasant
feel
cool
grass
about
their
toes
again
and
not
hurry
and
then
they
climbed
down
the
gushing
water
They
drank
little
clean
cold
sharp
draught
and
sat
down
mossy
stone
watching
the
patches
sun
the
grass
and
the
shadows
the
sailing
clouds
passing
over
the
floor
the
dingle
The
murmur
the
Ents
went
seemed
very
strange
and
remote
place
outside
their
world
and
far
from
everything
that
had
ever
happened
them
great
longing
came
over
them
for
the
faces
and
voices
their
companions
especially
for
Frodo
and
Sam
and
for
Strider
last
there
came
pause
the
Ent
voices
and
looking
they
saw
Treebeard
coming
towards
them
with
another
Ent
his
side
hoom
here
again
said
Treebeard
Are
you
getting
weary
feeling
impatient
hmm
Well
afraid
that
you
must
not
get
impatient
yet
have
finished
the
first
stage
now
but
have
still
got
explain
things
again
those
that
live
long
way
off
far
from
Isengard
and
those
that
could
not
get
round
before
the
Moot
and
after
that
shall
have
decide
what
However
deciding
what
does
not
take
Ents
long
going
over
all
the
facts
and
events
that
they
have
make
their
minds
about
Still
use
denying
shall
here
long
time
yet
couple
days
very
likely
have
brought
you
companion
has
ent
house
nearby
Bregalad
his
Elvish
name
says
has
already
made
his
mind
and
does
not
need
remain
the
Moot
the
nearest
thing
among
hasty
Ent
You
ought
get
together
Good
bye
Treebeard
turned
and
left
them
Bregalad
stood
for
some
time
surveying
the
hobbits
solemnly
and
they
looked
him
wondering
when
would
show
any
signs
hastiness
was
tall
and
seemed
one
the
younger
Ents
had
smooth
shining
skin
his
arms
and
legs
his
lips
were
ruddy
and
his
hair
was
grey
green
could
bend
and
sway
like
slender
tree
the
wind
last
spoke
and
his
voice
though
resonant
was
higher
and
clearer
than
Treebeard
hmm
friends
let
for
walk
said
Bregalad
TREEBEARD
483
that
Quickbeam
your
language
But
only
nickname
course
They
have
called
that
ever
since
said
yes
elder
Ent
before
had
finished
his
question
Also
drink
quickly
and
out
while
some
are
still
wetting
their
beards
Come
with
reached
down
two
shapely
arms
and
gave
long
fingered
hand
each
the
hobbits
All
that
day
they
walked
about
the
woods
with
him
singing
and
laughing
for
Quickbeam
often
laughed
laughed
the
sun
came
out
from
behind
cloud
laughed
they
came
upon
stream
spring
then
stooped
and
splashed
his
feet
and
head
with
water
laughed
sometimes
some
sound
whisper
the
trees
Whenever
saw
rowan
tree
halted
while
with
his
arms
stretched
out
and
sang
and
swayed
sang
nightfall
brought
them
his
ent
house
nothing
more
than
mossy
stone
set
upon
turves
under
green
bank
Rowan
trees
grew
circle
about
and
there
was
water
all
ent
houses
spring
bubbling
out
from
the
bank
They
talked
for
while
darkness
fell
the
forest
Not
far
away
the
voices
the
Entmoot
could
heard
still
going
but
now
they
seemed
deeper
and
less
leisurely
and
every
now
and
again
one
great
voice
would
rise
high
and
quicken
ing
music
while
all
the
others
died
away
But
beside
them
Bregalad
spoke
gently
their
own
tongue
almost
whispering
and
they
learned
that
belonged
Skinbark
people
and
the
country
where
they
had
lived
had
been
ravaged
That
seemed
the
hobbits
quite
enough
explain
his
hastiness
least
the
matter
Orcs
There
were
rowan
trees
home
said
Bregalad
softly
and
sadly
rowan
trees
that
took
root
when
was
Enting
many
many
years
ago
the
quiet
the
world
The
oldest
were
planted
the
Ents
try
and
please
the
Entwives
but
they
looked
them
and
smiled
and
said
that
they
knew
where
whiter
blossom
and
richer
fruit
were
growing
Yet
there
are
trees
all
that
race
the
people
the
Rose
that
are
beautiful
And
these
trees
grew
and
grew
till
the
shadow
each
was
like
green
hall
and
their
red
berries
the
autumn
were
burden
and
beauty
and
wonder
Birds
used
flock
there
like
birds
even
when
they
chatter
and
the
rowan
has
enough
and
spare
But
the
birds
became
unfriendly
and
greedy
and
tore
the
trees
and
threw
the
fruit
down
and
did
not
eat
Then
Orcs
came
with
axes
and
cut
down
trees
came
and
called
them
their
long
names
but
they
did
not
quiver
they
did
not
hear
answer
they
lay
dead

rowan
fair
upon
your
hair
how
white
the
blossom
lay

mine
saw
you

upon

Your

bright
your

light
your
voice
cool
and
soft

Upon

The
hobbits
fell
asleep
the
sound
the
soft
singing
Bregalad
that
seemed
lament
many
tongues
the
fall
trees
that
had
loved
The
next
day
they
spent
also
his
company
but
they
did
not
far
from
his
house
Most
the
time
they
sat
silent
under
the
shelter
the
bank
for
the
wind
was
colder
and
the
clouds
closer
and
greyer
there
was
little
sunshine
and
the
distance
the
voices
the
Ents
the
Moot
still
rose
and
fell
sometimes
loud
and
strong
sometimes
low
and
sad
sometimes
quickening
sometimes
slow
and
solemn
dirge
second
night
came
and
still
the
Ents
held
conclave
under
hurrying
clouds
and
fitful
stars
The
third
day
broke
bleak
and
windy
sunrise
the
Ents
voices
rose
great
clamour
and
then
died
down
again
the
morning
wore
the
wind
fell
and
the
air
grew
heavy
with
expectancy
The
hobbits
could
see
that
Bregalad
was
now
listening
intently
although
them
down
the
dell
his
ent
house
the
sound
the
Moot
was
faint
The
afternoon
came
and
the
sun
going
west
towards
the
moun
tains
sent
out
long
yellow
beams
between
the
cracks
and
fissures
the
clouds
Suddenly
they
were
aware
that
everything
was
very
quiet
the
whole
forest
stood
listening
silence
course
the
Ent
voices
had
stopped
What
did
that
mean
Bregalad
was
standing
erect
and
tense
looking
back
northwards
towards
Derndingle
Then
with
crash
came
great
ringing
shout
hoom
rah
The
trees
quivered
and
bent
gust
had
struck
them
There
was
another
pause
and
then
marching
music
began
like
solemn
drums
and
above
the
rolling
beats
and
booms
there
welled
voices
singing
high
and
strong
come
come
with
roll
drum
runda
runda

The
Ents
were
coming
ever
nearer
and
louder
rose
their
song
come
come
with
horn
and
drum
riina

Bregalad
picked
the
hobbits
and
strode
from
his
house
TREEBEARD
485
Before
long
they
saw
the
marching
line
approaching
the
Ents
were
swinging
along
with
great
strides
down
the
slope
towards
them
Treebeard
was
their
head
and
some
fifty
followers
were
behind
him
two
abreast
keeping
step
with
their
feet
and
beating
time
with
their
hands
upon
their
flanks
they
drew
near
the
flash
and
flicker
their
eyes
could
seen
Hoom

Here
come
with
boom
here
come
last
called
Treebeard
when
caught
sight
Bregalad
and
the
hobbits
Come

Moot

off

Isengard
Isengard
the
Ents
cried
many
voices
Isengard
Isengard
Though
Isengard
ringed
and
barred
with
doors

Though
Isengard
strong
and
hard

hew
the

For

With

with

they
sang
they
marched
southwards
Bregalad
his
eyes
shining
swung
into
the
line
beside
Treebeard
The
old
Ent
now
took
the
hobbits
back
and
set
them
his
shoulders
again
and
they
rode
proudly
the
head
the
singing
company
with
beating
hearts
and
heads
held
high
Though
they
had
expected
something
happen
eventually
they
were
amazed
the
change
that
had
come
over
the
Ents
seemed
now
sudden
the
bursting
flood
that
had
long
been
held
back
dike
The
Ents
made
their
minds
rather
quickly
after
all
didn
they
Pippin
ventured
say
after
some
time
when
for
moment
the
singing
paused
and
only
the
beating
hands
and
feet
was
heard
Quickly
said
Treebeard
Hoom
Yes
indeed
Quicker
than
expected
Indeed
have
not
seen
them
roused
like
this
for
many
age
Ents
not
like
being
roused
and
never
are
roused
unless
clear
that
our
trees
and
our
lives
are
great
danger
That
has
not
happened
this
Forest
since
the
wars
Sauron
and
the
Men
the
Sea
the
orc
work
the
wanton
hewing
rdrum
without
even
the
bad
excuse
feeding
the
fires
that
has
angered
and
the
treachery

should

You

Maybe

But
Saruman

try

you
won
yes
that
have
not
forgotten
Indeed
have
thought
long
about
But
you
see
many
the
Ents
are
younger
than
many
lives
trees
They
are
all
roused
now
and
their
mind
all
one
thing
breaking
Isengard
But
they
will
start
think
ing
again
before
long
they
will
cool
down
little
when
take
our
evening
drink
What
thirst
shall
have
But
let
them
march
now
and
sing
have
long
way
and
there
time
ahead
for
thought
something
have
started
Treebeard
marched
singing
with
the
others
for
while
But
after
time
his
voice
died
murmur
and
fell
silent
again
Pippin
could
see
that
his
old
brow
was
wrinkled
and
knotted
last
looked
and
Pippin
could
see
sad
look
his
eyes
sad
but
not
unhappy
There
was
light
them
the
green
flame
had
sunk
deeper
into
the
dark
wells
his
thought
course
likely
enough
friends
said
slowly
likely
enough
that
are
going
our
doom
the
last
march
the
Ents
But
stayed
home
and
did
nothing
doom
would
find
anyway
sooner
later
That
thought
has
long
been
growing
our
hearts
and
that
why
are
marching
now
was
not
hasty
resolve
Now
least
the
last
march
the
Ents
may
worth
song
Aye
sighed
may
help
the
other
peoples
before
pass
away
Still
should
have
liked
see
the
songs
come
true
about
the
Entwives
should
dearly
have
liked
see
Fimbrethil
again
But
there
friends
songs
like
trees
bear
fruit
only
their
own
time
and
their
own
way
and
sometimes
they
are
withered
untimely
The
Ents
went
striding
great
pace
They
had
descended
into
long
fold
the
land
that
fell
away
southward
now
they
began
climb
and
the
high
western
ridge
The
woods
fell
away
and
they
came
scattered
groups
birch
and
then
bare

slopes
where
only
few
gaunt
pine
trees
grew
The
sun
sank
behind
the
dark
hill

Grey
dusk
fell
Pippin
looked
behind
The
number
the
Ents
had
grown
what
was
happening
Where
the
dim
bare
slopes
that
they
had
crossed
should
lie
thought
saw
groves
trees
But
they
were
moving
Could
that
the
trees
Fangorn
were
awake
and
the
forest
was
rising
marching
over
the
hills
war
rubbed
his
eyes
wondering
sleep
and
shadow
had
deceived
him
but
the
great
grey
shapes
moved
steadily
onward
There
was
noise
like
wind
many
branches
The
Ents
were
drawing
near
the
crest
the
ridge
now
and
all
song
had
ceased
Night
fell
and
there
was
silence
nothing
was
heard
save
faint
quiver
the
earth
beneath
the
feet
the
Ents
and
rustle
the
shade
whisper
many
drifting
leaves
last
they
stood
upon
the
summit
and
looked
down
into
dark
pit

great
cleft

THE
WHITE
RIDER
very
bones
are
chilled
said
Gimli
flapping
his
arms
and
stamp
ing
his
feet
Day
had
come
last
dawn
the
companions
had
made
such
breakfast
they
could
now
the
growing
light
they
were
getting
ready
search
the
ground
again
for
signs
the
hobbits
And
not
forget
that
old
man
said
Gimli
should
happier
could
see
the
print
boot
Why
would
that
make
you
happy
said
Legolas
Because
old
man
with
feet
that
leave
marks
might
more
than
seemed
answered
the
Dwarf
Maybe
said
the
Elf
but
heavy
boot
might
leave
print
here
the
grass
deep
and
springy
That
would
not
baffle
Ranger
said
Gimli
bent
blade
enough
for
Aragorn
read
But
not
expect
him
find
any
traces
was
evil
phantom
Saruman
that
saw
last
night
sure
even
under
the
light
morning
His
eyes
are
looking
out
from
Fangorn
even
now
maybe
likely
enough
said
Aragorn
yet
not
sure
thinking
the
horses
You
said
last
night
Gimli
that
they
were
scared
away
But
did
not
think
Did
you
hear
them
Legolas
Did
they
sound
you
like
beasts
terror
said
Legolas
heard
them
clearly
But
for
the
darkness
and
our
own
fear
should
have
guessed
that
they
were
beasts
wild
with
some
sudden
gladness
They
spoke
horses
will
when
they
meet
friend
that
they
have
long
missed
thought
said
Aragorn
but
cannot
read
the
riddle
unless
they
return
Come
The
light
growing
fast
Let
look
first
and
guess
later
should
begin
here
near
our
own
camping
ground
searching
carefully
all
about
and
working
the
slope
towards
the
forest
find
the
hobbits
our
errand
whatever
may
think
our
visitor
the
night
they
escaped
some
chance
then
they
must
have
hidden
the
trees
they
would
have
been
seen
find
nothing
between
here
and
the
eaves
the
wood
then
will
make
last
search
upon
the
battle
field
and
among
the
ashes
But
there
little
hope
there
the
horsemen
Rohan
did
their
work
too
well
For
some
time
the
companions
crawled
and
groped
upon
the
ground
The
tree
stood
mournfully
above
them
its
dry
leaves
now
THE
WHITE
RIDER
489
hanging
limp
and
rattling
the
chill
easterly
wind
Aragorn
moved
slowly
away
came
the
ashes
the
watch
fire
near
the
river
bank
and
then
began
retrace
the
ground
back
towards
the
knoll
where
the
battle
had
been
fought
Suddenly
stooped
and
bent
low
with
his
face
almost
the
grass
Then
called
the
others
They
came
running
Here
last
find
news
said
Aragorn
lifted
broken
leaf
for
them
see
large
pale
leaf
golden
hue
now
fading
and
turning
brown
Here
mallorn
leaf
Lorien
and
there
are
small
crumbs
and
few
more
crumbs
the
grass
And
see
there
are
some
pieces
cut
cord
lying
nearby
And
here
the
knife
that
cut
them
said
Gimli
stooped
and
drew
out
tussock
into
which
some
heavy
foot
had
trampled
short
jagged
blade
The
haft
from
which
had
been
snapped
was
beside
was
orc
weapon
said
holding
gingerly
and
looking
with
disgust
the
carved
handle
had
been
shaped
like
hideous
head
with
squinting
eyes
and
leering
mouth
Well
here
the
strangest
riddle
that
have
yet
found
exclaimed
Legolas
bound
prisoner
escapes
both
from
the
Orcs
and
from
the
surrounding
horsemen
then
stops
while
still
the
open
and
cuts
his
bonds
with
orc
knife
But
how
and
why
For
his
legs
were
tied
how
did
walk
And
his
arms
were
tied
how
did
use
the
knife
And
neither
were
tied
why
did
cut
the
cords
all
Being
pleased
with
his
skill
then
sat
down
and
quietly
ate
some
waybread
That
least
enough
show
that
was
hobbit
without
the
mallorn
leaf
After
that
suppose
turned
his
arms
into
wings
and
flew
away
singing
into
the
trees
should
easy
find
him
only
need
wings
ourselves
There
was
sorcery
here
right
enough
said
Gimli
What
was
that
old
man
doing
What
have
you
say
Aragorn
the
reading
Legolas
Can
you
better
Maybe
could
said
Aragorn
smiling
There
are
some
other
signs
near
hand
that
you
have
not
considered
agree
that
the
prisoner
was
hobbit
and
must
have
had
either
legs
hands
free
before
came
here
guess
that
was
hands
because
the
riddle
then
becomes
easier
and
also
because
read
the
marks
was
carried
this
point
Orc
Blood
was
spilled
there
few
paces
away
orc
blood
There
are
deep
prints
hoofs
all
about
this
spot
and
signs
that
heavy
thing
was
dragged
away
The
Orc
was
slain
horsemen
and
later
his
body
was
hauled
the
fire
But
the
hobbit
was
not
seen
was
not
the
open
for
was
night
and
still
had
his
elven
cloak
was
exhausted
and
hungry
and
not
wondered
that
when
had
cut
his
bonds
with
the
knife
his
fallen
enemy
rested
and
ate
little
before
crept
away
But
490
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
comfort
know
that
had
some
embas
his
pocket
even
though
ran
away
without
gear
pack
that
perhaps
like
hobbit
say
though
hope
and
guess
that
both
Merry
and
Pippin
were
here
together
There
however
nothing
show
that
for
certain
And
how
you
suppose
that
either
our
friends
came
have
hand
free
asked
Gimli
not
know
how
happened
answered
Aragorn
Nor
know
why
Orc
was
carrying
them
away
Not
help
them
escape
may
sure
Nay
rather
think
that
now
begin
understand
matter
that
has
puzzled
from
the
beginning
why
when
Boromir
had
fallen
were
the
Orcs
content
with
the
capture
Merry
and
Pippin
They
did
not
seek
out
the
rest
nor
attack
our
camp
but
instead
they
went
with
all
speed
towards
Isengard
Did
they
suppose
they
had
captured
the
Ring
bearer
and
his
faithful
comrade
think
not
Their
masters
would
not
dare
give
such
plain
orders
Orcs
even
they
knew
much
themselves
they
would
not
speak
openly
them
the
Ring
they
are
not
trusty
servants
But
think
the
Orcs
had
been
commanded
capture
hob
bits
alive
all
costs
attempt
was
made
slip
out
with
the
precious
prisoners
before
the
battle
Treachery
perhaps
likely
enough
with
such
folk
some
large
and
bold
Orc
may
have
been
trying
escape
with
the
prize
alone
for
his
own
ends
There
that
tale
Others
might
devised
But
this
may
count
any
case
one
least
our
friends
escaped
our
task
find
him
and
help
him
before
return
Rohan
must
not
daunted
Fangorn
since
need
drove
him
into
that
dark
place
not
know
which
daunts
more
Fangorn
the
thought
the
long
road
through
Rohan
foot
said
Gimli
Then
let
the
forest
said
Aragorn
was
not
long
before
Aragorn
found
fresh
signs
one
point
near
the
bank
the
Entwash
came
upon
footprints
hobbit
prints
but
too
light
for
much
made
them
Then
again
beneath
the
bole
great
tree
the
very
edge
the
wood
more
prints
were
discovered
The
earth
was
bare
and
dry
and
did
not
reveal
much
One
hobbit
least
stood
here
for
while
and
looked
back
and
then
turned
away
into
the
forest
said
Aragorn
Then
must
too
said
Gimli
But
not
like
the
look
this
Fangorn
and
were
warned
against
wish
the
chase
had
led
anywhere
else
not
think
the
wood
feels
evil
whatever
tales
may
say
said
Legolas
stood
under
the
eaves
the
forest
stooping
forward
THE

and
peering
with

eyes
into

only
the

dark
places

There

there
watchfulness

Well

Gimli

That
just
well
said
Legolas
But
nonetheless
has
suffered
harm
There
something
happening

going
happen
you
not
feel
the
tenseness
takes
breath
feel
the

the
Dwarf
This

lighter
than

musty
and

very

the

say

Gimli
You
are
Wood

anyway
though
Elves
any
kind
are
strange
folk
Yet
you

Where
you

But
keep

Not

added
hastily

all
Let
With
that
the
three
hunters
plunged
into
the
forest
Fangorn
Legolas
and
Gimli
left
the
tracking
Aragorn
There
was
little
for
him
see
The
floor
the
forest
was
dry
and
covered
with
drift
leaves
but
guessing
that
the
fugitives
would
stay
near
the
water
returned
often
the
banks
the
stream
was
that
came
upon
the
place
where
Merry
and
Pippin
had
drunk
and
bathed
their
feet
There
plain
for
all
see
were
the
footprints
two
hobbits
one
somewhat
smaller
than
the
other
This
good
tidings
said
Aragorn
Yet
the
marks
are
two
days
old
And
seems
that
this
point
the
hobbits
left
the
water
side
Then
what
shall
now
said
Gimli
cannot
pursue
them
through
the
whole
fastness
Fangorn
have
come
ill
supplied
not
find
them
soon
shall
use
them
except
sit
down
beside
them
and
show
our
friendship
starving
together
that
indeed
all
can
then
must

said
Aragorn
Let
They
came
length
the
steep
abrupt
end
Treebeard
Hill
and
looked
the
rock
wall
with
its
rough
steps
leading
the
high
shelf
Gleams
sun
were
striking
through
the
hurrying
clouds
and
the
forest
now
looked
less
grey
and
drear

THE
LORD
THE

Let
and
look
about
said
Legolas
still
feel
breath
short
should
like
taste
freer
air
for
while
The
companions
climbed
Aragorn
came
last
moving
slowly
was
scanning
the
steps
and
ledges
closely
almost
sure
that
the
hobbits
have
been
here
said
But
there
are
other
marks
very
strange
marks
which
not
under
stand
wonder
can
see
anything
from
this
ledge
which
will
help
guess
which
way
they
went
next
stood
and
looked
about
but
saw
nothing
that
was
any
use
The
shelf
faced
southward
and
eastward
but
only
the
east
was
the
view
open
There
could
see
the
heads
the
trees
descending
ranks
towards
the
plain
from
which
they
had
come
have
journeyed
long
way
round
said
Legolas
could
have
all
come
here
safe
together
had
left
the
Great
River
the
second
third
day
and
struck
west
Few
can
foresee
whither
their
road
will
lead
them
till
they
come
its
end
But
did
not
wish
come
Fangorn
said
Gimli
Yet
here
are
and
nicely
caught
the
net
said
Legolas
Look
Look
what
said
Gimli
There
the
trees
Where
have
not
elf
eyes
Hush
Speak
more
softly
Look
said
Legolas
pointing
Down
the
wood
back
the
way
that
have
just
come
Cannot
you
see
him
passing
from
tree
tree
see
see
now
hissed
Gimli
Look
Aragorn
Did
not
warn
your
There
the
old
man
All
dirty
grey
rags
that
why
could
not
see
him
first
Aragorn
looked
and
beheld
bent
figure
moving
slowly
was
not
far
away
looked
like
old
beggar
man
walking
wearily
leaning
rough
staff
His
head
was
bowed
and
did
not
look
towards
them
other
lands
they
would
have
greeted
him
with
kind
words
but
now
they
stood
silent
each
feeling
strange
expectancy
something
was
approaching
that
held
hidden
power
menace
Gimli
gazed
with
wide
eyes
for
while
step
step
the
figure
drew
nearer
Then
suddenly
unable
contain
himself
longer
burst
out
Your
bow
Legolas
Bend
Get
ready
Saruman
not
let
him
speak
put
spell
upon
Shoot
first
Legolas
took
his
bow
and
bent
slowly
and
some
other
will
resisted
him
held
arrow
loosely
his
hand
but
did
not
fit
the
string
Aragorn
stood
silent
his
face
was
watchful
and
intent
Why
are
you
waiting
What
the
matter
with
you
said
Gimli
hissing
whisper
Legolas
right
said
Aragorn
quietly
may
not
shoot
old
THE
WHITE
RIDER
493
man
unawares
and
unchallenged
whatever
fear
doubt
Watch
and
wait
that
moment
the
old
man
quickened
his
pace
and
came
with
surprising
speed
the
foot
the
rock
wall
Then
suddenly
looked
while
they
stood
motionless
looking
down
There
was
sound
They
could
not
see
his
face
was
hooded
and
above
the
hood
wore
wide
brimmed
hat
that
all
his
features
were
overshadowed
except
for
the
end
his
nose
and
his
grey
beard
Yet
seemed
Aragorn
that
caught
the
gleam
eyes
keen
and
bright
from
within
the
shadow
the
hooded
brows
last
the
old
man
broke
the
silence
Well
met
indeed
friends
said
soft
voice
wish
speak
you
Will
you
come
down
shall
come
Without
waiting
for
answer
began
climb
Now
cried
Gimli
Stop
him
Legolas
Did
not
say
that
wished
speak
you
said
the
old
man
Put
away
that
bow
Master
Elf
The
bow
and
arrow
fell
from
Legolas
hands
and
his
arms
hung
loose
his
sides
And
you
Master
Dwarf
pray
take
your
hand
from
your
axe
haft
till
You
will
not
need
such
arguments
Gimli
started
and
then
stood
still
stone
staring
while
the
old
man
sprang
the
rough
steps
nimbly
goat
All
weariness
seemed
have
left
him
stepped
the
shelf
there
was
gleam
too
brief
for
certainty
quick
glint
white
some
garment
shrouded
the
grey
rags
had
been
for
instant
revealed
The
intake
Gimli
breath
could
heard
loud
hiss
the
silence
Well
met
say
again
said
the
old
man
coming
towards
them
When
was
few
feet
away
stood
stooping
over
his
staff
with
his
head
thrust
forward
peering
them
from
under
his
hood
And
what
may
you
doing
these
parts
Elf
Man
and
Dwarf
all
clad
Elvish
fashion
doubt
there
tale
worth
hearing
behind
all
Such
things
are
not
often
seen
here
You
speak
one
that
knows
Fangorn
well
said
Aragorn
that
Not
well
said
the
old
man
that
would
the
study
many
lives
But
come
here
now
and
again
Might
know
your
name
and
then
hear
what
that
you
have
say
said
Aragorn
The
morning
passes
and
have
errand
that
will
not
wait
for
what
wished
say
have
said
What
may
you
494
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
doing
and
what
tale
can
you
tell
yourselves
for
name
broke
off
laughing
long
and
softly
Aragorn
felt
shudder
run
through
him
the
sound
strange
cold
thrill
and
yet
was
not
fear
terror
that
felt
rather
was
like
the
sudden
bite
keen
air
the
slap
cold
rain
that
wakes
uneasy
sleeper
name
said
the
old
man
again
Have
you
not
guessed
already
You
have
heard
before
think
Yes
you
have
heard
before
But
come
now
what
your
tale
The
three
companions
stood
silent
and
made
answer
There
are
some
who
would
begin
doubt
whether
your
errand
fit
tell
said
the
old
man
Happily
know
something
You
are
tracking
the
footsteps
two
young
hobbits
believe
Yes
hob
bits
Don
stare
you
had
never
heard
the
strange
name
before
You
have
and
have
Well
they
climbed
here
the
day
before
yesterday
and
they
met
someone
that
they
did
not
expect
Does
that
comfort
you
And
now
you
would
like
know
where
they
were
taken
Well
well
maybe
can
give
you
some
news
about
that
But
why
are
standing
Your
errand
you
see
longer
urgent
you
thought
Let
sit
down
and
more
ease
The
old
man
turned
away
and
went
towards
heap
fallen
stones
and
rock
the
foot
the
cliff
behind
Immediately
spell
had
been
removed
the
others
relaxed
and
stirred
Gimli
hand
went
once
his
axe
haft
Aragorn
drew
his
sword
Legolas
picked
his
bow
The
old
man
took
notice
but
stooped
and
sat
himself
low
flat
stone
Then
his
grey
cloak
drew
apart
and
they
saw
beyond
doubt
that
was
clothed
beneath
all
white
Saruman
cried
Gimli
springing
towards
him
with
axe
hand
Speak
Tell
where
you
have
hidden
our
friends
What
have
you
done
with
them
Speak
will
make
dint
your
hat
that
even
wizard
will
find
hard
deal
with
The
old
man
was
too
quick
for
him
sprang
his
feet
and
leaped
the
top
large
rock
There
stood
grown
suddenly
tall
towering
above
them
His
hood
and
his
grey
rags
were
flung
away
His
white
garments
shone
lifted
his
staff
and
Gimli
axe
leaped
from
his
grasp
and
fell
ringing
the
ground
The
sword
Aragorn
stiff
his
motionless
hand
blazed
with
sudden
fire
Legolas
gave
great
shout
and
shot
arrow
high
into
the
air
vanished
flash
flame
Mithrandir
cried
Mithrandir
Well
met
say
you
again
Legolas
said
the
old
man
They
all
gazed
him
His
hair
was
white
snow
the
sunshine
and
gleaming
white
was
his
robe
the
eyes
under
his
deep
brows
were
THE
WHITE
RIDER
495
bright
piercing
the
rays
the
sun
power
was
his
hand
Between
wonder
joy
and
fear
they
stood
and
found
words
say
last
Aragorn
stirred
Gandalf
said
Beyond
all
hope
you
return
our
need
What
veil
was
over
sight
Gandalf
Gimli
said
nothing
but
sank
his
knees
shading
his
eyes
Gandalf
the
old
man
repeated
recalling
from
old
memory
long
disused
word
Yes
that
was
the
name
was
Gandalf
stepped
down
from
the
rock
and
picking
his
grey
cloak
wrapped
about
him
seemed
the
sun
had
been
shining
but
now
was
hid
cloud
again
Yes
you
may
still
call
Gandalf
said
and
the
voice
was
the
voice
their
old
friend
and
guide
Get
good
Gimli
blame
you
and
harm
done
Indeed
friends
none
you
have
any
weapon
that
could
hurt
merry
meet
again
the
turn
the
tide
The
great
storm
coming
but
the
tide
has
turned
laid
his
hand
Gimli
head
and
the
Dwarf
looked
and
laughed
suddenly
Gandalf
said
But
you
are
all
white
Yes
white
now
said
Gandalf
Indeed
Saruman
one
might
almost
say
Saruman
should
have
been
But
come
now
tell
yourselves
have
passed
through
fire
and
deep
water
since
parted
have
forgotten
much
that
thought
knew
and
learned
again
much
that
had
forgotten
can
see
many
things
far
off
but
many
things
that
are
close
hand
cannot
see
Tell
yourselves
What
you
wish
know
said
Aragorn
All
that
has
happened
since
parted
the
bridge
would
long
tale
Will
you
not
first
give
news
the
hobbits
Did
you
find
them
and
are
they
safe
did
not
find
them
said
Gandalf
There
was
darkness
over
the
valleys
the
Emyn
Muil
and
did
not
know
their
captivity
until
the
eagle
told
The
eagle
said
Legolas
have
seen
eagle
high
and
far
off
the
last
time
was
four
days
ago
above
the
Emyn
Muil
Yes
said
Gandalf
that
was
Gwaihir
the
Windlord
who
rescued
from
Orthanc
sent
him
before
watch
the
River
and
gather
tidings
His
sight
keen
but
cannot
see
all
that
passes
under
hill
and
tree
Some
things
has
seen
and
others
have
seen
myself
The
Ring
now
has
passed
beyond
help
the
help
any
the
Company
that
set
out
from
Rivendell
Very
nearly
was
revealed
the
Enemy
but
escaped
had
some
part
that
for
sat
high
place
and
strove
with
the
Dark
Tower
and
the
Shadow
passed
Then
was
weary
very
weary
and
walked
long
dark
thought
Then
you
know
about
Frodo
said
Gimli
How
things
with
him
496
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
cannot
say
was
saved
from
great
peril
but
many
lie
before
him
still
resolved
alone
Mordor
and
set
out
that
all
that
can
say
Not
alone
said
Legolas
think
that
Sam
went
with
him
Did
said
Gandalf
and
there
was
gleam
his
eye
and
smile
his
face
Did
indeed
news
yet
does
not
surprise
Good
Very
good
You
lighten
heart
You
must
tell
more
Now
sit
and
tell
the
tale
your
journey
The
companions
sat
the
ground
his
feet
and
Aragorn
took
the
tale
For
long
while
Gandalf
said
nothing
and
asked
questions
His
hands
were
spread
upon
his
knees
and
his
eyes
were
closed
last
when
Aragorn
spoke
the
death
Boromir
and
his
last
journey
upon
the
Great
River
the
old
man
sighed
You
have
not
said
all
that
you
know
guess
Aragorn
friend
said
quietly
Poor
Boromir
could
not
see
what
happened
him
was
sore
trial
for
such
man
warrior
and
lord
men
Galadriel
told
that
was
peril
But
escaped
the
end
glad
was
not
vain
that
the
young
hobbits
came
with
only
for
Boromir
sake
But
that
not
the
only
part
they
have
play
They
were
brought
Fangorn
and
their
coming
was
like
the
falling
small
stones
that
starts
avalanche
the
mountains
Even
talk
here
hear
the
first
rumblings
Saruman
had
best
not
caught
away
from
home
when
the
dam
bursts
one
thing
you
have
not
changed
dear
friend
said
Aragorn
you
still
speak
riddles
What
riddles
said
Gandalf
For
was
talking
aloud
myself
habit
the
old
they
choose
the
wisest
person
present
speak
the
long
explanations
needed
the
young
are
wearying
laughed
but
the
sound
now
seemed
warm
and
kindly
gleam
sunshine
Iam
longer
young
even
the
reckoning
Men
the
Ancient
Houses
said
Aragorn
Will
you
not
open
your
mind
more
clearly
What
then
shall
say
said
Gandalf
and
paused
for
while
thought
This
brief
how
see
things
the
moment
you
wish
have
piece
mind
plain
possible
The
Enemy
course
has
long
known
that
the
Ring
abroad
and
that
borne
hobbit
knows
now
the
number
our
Company
that
set
out
from
Rivendell
and
the
kind
each
But
does
not
yet
perceive
our
purpose
clearly
supposes
that
were
all
going
Minas
Tirith
for
that
what
would
himself
have
done
our
place
And
according
his
wisdom
would
have
been
heavy
stroke
against
his
power
Indeed
great
fear
not
knowing
what
mighty
THE
WHITE
RIDER
497
one
may
suddenly
appear
wielding
the
Ring
and
assailing
him
with
war
seeking
cast
him
down
and
take
his
place
That
should
wish
cast
him
down
and
have
one
his
place
not
thought
that
occurs
his
mind
That
should
try
destroy
the
Ring
itself
has
not
yet
entered
into
his
darkest
dream
which
doubt
you
will
see
our
good
fortune
and
our
hope
For
imagining
war
has
let
loose
war
believing
that
has
time
waste
for
that
strikes
the
first
blow
strikes
hard
enough
may
need
strike
more
the
forces
that
has
long
been
preparing
now
setting
motion
sooner
than
intended
Wise
fool
For
had
used
all
his
power
guard
Mordor
that
none
could
enter
and
bent
all
his
guile
the
hunting
the
Ring
then
indeed
hope
would
have
faded
neither
Ring
nor
bearer
could
long
have
eluded
him
But
now
his
eye
gazes
abroad
rather
than
near
home
and
mostly
looks
towards
Minas
Tirith
Very
soon
now
his
strength
will
fall
upon
like
storm
For
already
knows
that
the
messengers
that
sent
waylay
the
Company
have
failed
again
They
have
not
found
the
Ring
Neither
have
they
brought
away
any
hobbits
hostages
Had
they
done
even
much
that
would
have
been
heavy
blow
and
might
have
been
fatal
But
let
not
darken
our
hearts
imagining
the
trial
their
gentle
loyalty
the
Dark
Tower
For
the
Enemy
has
failed
far
Thanks
Saruman
Then
not
Saruman
traitor
said
Gimli
Indeed
yes
said
Gandalf
Doubly
And
not
that
strange
Noth
ing
that
have
endured
late
has
seemed
grievous
the
treason
Isengard
Even
reckoned
lord
and
captain
Saruman
has
grown
very
strong
threatens
the
Men
Rohan
and
draws
off
their
help
from
Minas
Tirith
even
the
main
blow
approaching
from
the
East
Yet
treacherous
weapon
ever
danger
the
hand
Saruman
also
had
mind
capture
the
Ring
for
himself
least
snare
some
hobbits
for
his
evil
purposes
between
them
our
enemies
have
contrived
only
bring
Merry
and
Pippin
with
marvellous
speed
and
the
nick
time
Fangorn
where
otherwise
they
would
never
have
come
all
Also
they
have
filled
themselves
with
new
doubts
that
disturb
their
plans
tidings
the
battle
will
come
Mordor
thanks
the
horsemen
Rohan
but
the
Dark
Lord
knows
that
two
hobbits
were
taken
the
Emyn
Muil
and
borne
away
towards
Isengard
against
the
will
his
own
servants
now
has
Isengard
fear
well
Minas
Tirith
Minas
Tirith
falls
will
ill
with
Saruman
pity
that
our
friends
lie
between
said
Gimli
land
divided
Isengard
and
Mordor
then
they
could
fight
while
watched
and
waited
498
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
The
victor
would
emerge
stronger
than
either
and
free
from
doubt
said
Gandalf
But
Isengard
cannot
fight
Mordor
unless
Saruman
first
obtains
the
Ring
That
will
never
now
does
not
yet
know
his
peril
There
much
that
does
not
know
was
eager
lay
his
hands
his
prey
that
could
not
wait
home
and
came
forth
meet
and
spy
his
messengers
But
came
too
late
for
once
and
the
battle
was
over
and
beyond
his
help
before
reached
these
parts
did
not
remain
here
long
look
into
his
mind
and
see
his
doubt
has
woodcraft
believes
that
the
horsemen
slew
and
burned
all
upon
the
field
battle
but
does
not
know
whether
the
Orcs
were
bringing
any
prisoners
not
And
does
not
know
the
quarrel
between
his
servants
and
the
Orcs
Mordor
nor
does
know
the
Winged
Messenger
The
Winged
Messenger
cried
Legolas
shot
him
with
the
bow
Galadriel
above
Sarn
Gebir
and
felled
him
from
the
sky
filled
all
with
fear
What
new
terror
this
One
that
you
cannot
slay
with
arrows
said
Gandalf
You
only
slew
his
steed
was
good
deed
but
the
Rider
was
soon
horsed
again
For
was
Nazgil
one
the
Nine
who
ride
now
upon
winged
steeds
Soon
their
terror
will
overshadow
the
last
armies
our
friends
cutting
off
the
sun
But
they
have
not
yet
been
allowed
cross
the
River
and
Saruman
does
not
know
this
new
shape
which
the
Ringwraiths
have
been
clad
His
thought
ever
the
Ring
Was
present
the
battle
Was
found
What
Théoden
Lord
the
Mark
should
come
and
learn
its
power
That
the
danger
that
sees
and
has
fled
back
Isengard
double
and
treble
his
assault
Rohan
And
all
the
time
there
another
danger
close
hand
which
does
not
see
busy
with
his
fiery
thoughts
has
forgotten
Treebeard
Now
you
speak
yourself
again
said
Aragorn
with
smile
Treebeard
not
known
And
have
guessed
part
Saruman
double
treachery
yet
not
see
what
way
the
coming
two
hobbits
Fangorn
has

and
fruitless
chase
Wait
minute
cried
Gimli
There
another
thing
that
should
like
know
first
Was
you
Gandalf
Saruman
that
saw
last
night
You
certainly
did
not
see
answered
Gandalf
therefore
must
guess
that
you
saw
Saruman
Evidently
look
much
alike
that
your
desire
make
incurable
dent
hat
must
excused
Good
good

Gimli
glad
that

Yes

comfort
not
mistaken
all
points
not
know
only
too
well
But
course
never
blamed
you
for
your
welcome
How
could
who
have
often
counselled
friends
suspect
even
their
own
hands
when
dealing
with
the
Enemy
Bless
you
Gimli
son
Gloin
Maybe
you
will
see
both
together
one
day
and
judge
between
But
the
hobbits
Legolas
broke
have
come
far
seek
them
and
you
seem
know
where
they
are
Where
are
they
now
With
Treebeard
and
the
Ents
said
Gandalf
The
Ents
exclaimed
Aragorn
Then
there
truth
the
old
legends
about
the
dwellers
the
deep
forests
and
the
giant
shepherds
the
trees
Are
there
still
Ents
the
world
thought
they
were
only
memory
ancient
days
indeed
they
were
ever
more
than
legend
Rohan
legend
Rohan
cried
Legolas
Nay
every
Elf
Wilderland
has
sung
songs
the
old
Onodrim
and
their
long
sorrow
Yet
even
among
they
are
only
memory
were
meet
one
still
walking
this
world
then
indeed
should
feel
young
again
But
Treebeard
that
only
rendering
Fangorn
into
the
Common
Speech
yet
you
seem
speak
person
Who
this
Treebeard
now
you
are
asking
much
said
Gandalf
The
little
that
know
his
long
slow
story
would
make
tale
for
which
have
time
now
Treebeard
Fangorn
the
guardian
the
forest
the
oldest
the
Ents
the
oldest
living
thing
that
still
walks
beneath
the
Sun
upon
this
Middle
earth
hope
indeed
Legolas
that
you
may
yet
meet
him
Merry
and
Pippin
have
been
fortunate
they
met
him
here
even
where
sit
For
came
here
two
days
ago
and
bore
them
away
his
dwelling
far
off
the
roots
the
mountains
often
comes
here
especially
when
his
mind
uneasy
and
rumours
the
world
outside
trouble
him
saw
him
four
days
ago
striding
among
the
trees
and
think
saw
for
paused
but
did
not
speak
for
was
heavy
with
thought
and
weary
after
struggle
with
the
Eye
Mordor
and
did
not
speak
either
nor
call
name
Perhaps
also
thought
that
you
were
Saruman
said
Gimli
But
you
speak
him
was
friend
thought
Fangorn
was
dangerous
Dangerous
cried
Gandalf
And
very
dangerous
more
dangerous
than
anything
you
will
ever
meet
unless
you
are
brought
alive
before
the
seat
the
Dark
Lord
And
Aragorn
dangerous
and
Legolas
dangerous
You
are
beset
with
dangers
Gimli
son
Gloin
for
you
are
dangerous
yourself
your
own
fashion
Certainly
the
forest
Fangorn
perilous
not
least
those
that
are
too
ready
with
their
axes
and
Fangorn
himself
perilous
too
yet
wise
and
kindly
nonetheless
But
now
his
long
slow
wrath
500
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
brimming
over
and
all
the
forest

with
The
coming

hobbits

its

not

since
the
Elder
Days
the

What

The

gazed
straight

The

Soon

Aragorn
said
Gandalf
That

But

hope
Hope

War
upon
and
all

with

Gandalf
Gandalf
the
White
but
Black
mightier
still
rose
and
gazed
out
eastward
shading
his
eyes
saw
things
far
away
that
none

Then
shook
his

Aragorn
But
not

that
you
will
come
there
before

and
looked
long
Gandalf
The
others
gazed
them
silence
they
stood
there
facing
one
another
The
grey
figure
the
Man
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
was
tall
and
stern
stone
his
hand
upon
the
hilt
his
sword
looked
some
king
out
the

the
sea
had
stepped
upon
the
shores
lesser

Before
him
stooped
the
old
figure
white
shining
now
with
some
light
kindled
within
bent
laden
with
years
but
holding
power
beyond

strength
kings
not

Gandalf
said
Aragorn

that

Yes

said
Legolas
But
first
would
ease
heart
Gandalf
hear
what
befell
you
Moria
Will
you
not

Can
you
not

even
tell
your
friends
how
you

Gandalf
Time
short
But
there

not

you
all
Then
tell
what
you
will
and
time
allows
said
Gimli
Come
Gandalf
tell
how
you
fared
with
the
Balrog
Name
him
not
said
Gandalf
and
for
moment
seemed
that
cloud
pain
passed
over
his
face
and
sat
silent
looking
old
death
Long
time
fell
said
last
slowly
thinking
back
with

Long
fell

with
His
fire

Then
plunged
into
the

and
all

Cold
was

death
almost
froze

Deep
the
abyss
that

Durin
Bridge

Gimli
Yet

Gandalf
Thither

His

but
now

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
darken
the
light
day
that
despair
enemy
was
only
hope
and
pursued
him
clutching
his
heel
Thus
brought
back
last
the
secret
ways
Khazad
dim
too
well
knew
them
all
Ever
now
went
until
came
the
Endless
Stair
Long
has
that
been
lost
said
Gimli
Many
have
said
that
was
never
made
save
legend
but
others
say
that
was
destroyed
was
made
and
had
not
been
destroyed
said
Gandalf
From
the
lowest
dungeon
the
highest
peak
climbed
ascending
unbroken
spiral
many
thousand
steps
until
issued
last
Durin
Tower
carved
the
living
rock
Zirakzigil
the
pinnacle
the
Silvertine
There
upon
Celebdil
was
lonely
window
the
snow
and
before
lay
narrow
space
dizzy
eyrie
above
the
mists
the
world
The
sun
shone
fiercely
there
but
all
below
was
wrapped
cloud
Out
sprang
and
even
came
behind
burst
into
new
flame
There
was
none
see
perhaps
after
ages
songs
would
still
sung
the
Battle
the
Peak
Suddenly
Gandalf
laughed
But
what
would
they
say
song
Those
that
looked
from
afar
thought
that
the
mountain
was
crowned
with
storm
Thunder
they
heard
and
lightning
they
said
smote
upon
Celebdil
and
leaped
back
broken
into
tongues
fire
not
that
enough
great
smoke
rose
about
vapour
and
steam
Ice
fell
like
rain
threw
down
enemy
and
fell
from
the
high
place
and
broke
the
mountain
side
where
smote
his
ruin
Then
darkness
took
and
strayed
out
thought
and
time
and
wandered
far
roads
that
will
not
tell
Naked
was
sent
back
for
brief
time
until
task
done
And
naked
lay
upon
the
mountain
top
The
tower
behind
was
crumbled
into
dust
the
window
gone
the
ruined
stair
was
choked
with
burned
and
broken
stone
was
alone
forgotten
without
escape
upon
the
hard
horn
the
world
There
lay
staring
upward
while
the
stars
wheeled
over
and
each
day
was
long
life
age
the
earth
Faint
ears
came
the
gathered
rumour
all
lands
the
springing
and
the
dying
the
song
and
the
weeping
and
the
slow
everlasting
groan
over
burdened
stone
And
the
last
Gwaihir
the
Windlord
found
again
and
took
and
bore
away
Rver
fated
your
burden
friend
need
said
burden
you
have
been
answered
but
not
now
Light
swan
feather
claw
you
are
The
Sun
shines
through
you
Indeed
not
think
you
need
any
more
were
let
you
fall
you
would
float
upon
the
wind
not
let
fall
gasped
for
felt
life
again
Bear
Lothlorien
That
indeed
the
command
the
Lady
Galadriel
who
sent
look
for
you
answered
THE
WHITE
RIDER
503
Thus
was
that
came
Caras
Galadhon
and
found
you
but
lately
gone
tarried
there
the
ageless
time
that
land
where
days
bring
healing
not
decay
Healing
found
and
was
clothed
white
Counsel
gave
and
counsel
took
Thence
strange
roads
came
and
messages
bring
some
you
Aragorn
was
bidden
say
this
Where
now
are
the
Dunedain
Elessar
Elessar
Why
thy
kinsfolk
wander
afar
Near
the
hour
when
the
Lost
should
come
forth
And
the
Grey
Company
ride
from
the
North
But
dark
the
path
appointed
for
thee
The
Dead
watch
the
road
that
leads
the
Sea
Legolas
she
sent
this
word
Legolas
Greenleaf
long
under
tree
joy
thou
hast
lived
Beware
the
Sea
thou
hearest
the
cry
the
gull
the
shore
Thy
heart
shall
then
rest
the
forest
more
Gandalf
fell
silent
and
shut
his
eyes
Then
she
sent
message
said
Gimli
and
bent
his
head
Dark
are
her
words
said
Legolas
and
little
they
mean
those
that
receive
them
That
comfort
said
Gimli
What
then
said
Legolas
Would
you
have
her
speak
openly
you
your
death
Yes
she
had
naught
else
say
What
that
said
Gandalf
opening
his
eyes
Yes
think
can
guess
what
her
words
may
mean
Your
pardon
Gimli
was
pon
dering
the
messages
once
again
But
indeed
she
sent
words
you
and
neither
dark
nor
sad
Gimli
son
Gldin
she
said
give
his
Lady
greeting
Lockbearer
wherever
thou
goest
thought
goes
with
thee
But
have
care
lay
thine
axe
the
right
tree
happy
hour
you
have
returned
Gandalf
cried
the
Dwarf
capering
sang
loudly
the
strange
dwarf
tongue
Come
come
shouted
swinging
his
axe
Since
Gandalf
head
now
sacred
let
find
one
that
right
cleave
That
will
not
far
seek
said
Gandalf
rising
from
his
seat
Come
have
spent
all
the
time
that
allowed
meeting
parted
friends
Now
there
need
haste
504
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
wrapped
himself
again
his
old
tattered
cloak
and
led
the
way
Following
him
they
descended
quickly
from
the
high
shelf
and
made
their
way
back
through
the
forest
down
the
bank
the
Entwash
They
spoke
more
words
until
they
stood
again
upon
the
grass
beyond
the
eaves
Fangorn
There
was
sign
their
horses
seen
They
have
not
returned
said
Legolas
will
weary
walk
shall
not
walk
Time
presses
said
Gandalf
Then
lifting
his
head
gave
long
whistle
clear
and
piercing
was
the
note
that
the
others
stood
amazed
hear
such
sound
come
from
those
old
bearded
lips
Three
times
whistled
and
then
faint
and
far
off
seemed
them
that
they
heard
the
whinny
horse
borne
from
the
plains
upon
the
eastern
wind
They
waited
wondering
Before
long
there
came
the
sound
hoofs
first
hardly
more
than
tremor
the
ground
perceptible
only
Aragorn
lay
upon
the
grass
then
growing
steadily
louder
and
clearer
quick
beat
There
more
than
one
horse
coming
said
Aragorn
Certainly
said
Gandalf
are
too
great
burden
for
one
There
are
three
said
Legolas
gazing
out
over
the
plain
See
how
they
run
There
Hasufel
and
there
friend
Arod
beside
him
But
there
another
that
strides
ahead
very
great
horse
have
not
seen
his
like
before
Nor
will
you
again
said
Gandalf
That
Shadowfax
the
chief
the
Mearas
lords
horses
and
not
even
Théoden
King
Rohan
has
ever
looked
better
Does
not
shine
like
silver
and
run
smoothly
swift
stream
has
come
for
the
horse
the
White
Rider
are
going
battle
together
Even
the
old
wizard
spoke
the
great
horse
came
striding
the
slope
towards
them
his
coat
was
glistening
and
his
mane
flowing
the
wind
his
speed
The
two
others
followed
now
far
behind
soon
Shadowfax
saw
Gandalf
checked
his
pace
and
whin
nied
loudly
then
trotting
gently
forward
stooped
his
proud
head
and
nuzzled
his
great
nostrils
against
the
old
man
neck
Gandalf
caressed
him
long
way
from
Rivendell
friend
said
but
you
are
wise
and
swift
and
come
need
Far
let
ride
now
together
and
part
not
this
world
again
Soon
the
other
horses
came
and
stood
quietly
awaiting
orders
once
Meduseld
the
hall
your
master
Théoden
said
Gandalf
addressing
them
gravely
They
bowed
their
heads
Time
presses
with
your
leave
friends
will
ride
beg
you
use
all
the
speed
that
you
can
Hasufel
shall
bear
Aragorn
and
Arod
Legolas
will
set
Gimli
before
and
his
leave
Shadowfax
shall
bear
both
will
wait
now
only
drink
little
THE
WHITE
RIDER
505
Now
understand
part
last
night
riddle
said
Legolas
sprang
lightly
upon
Arod
back
Whether
they
fled
first
fear
not
our
horses
met
Shadowfax
their
chieftain
and
greeted
him
with
joy
Did
you
know
that
was
hand
Gandalf
Yes
knew
said
the
wizard
bent
thought
upon
him
bidding
him
make
haste
for
yesterday
was
far
away
the
south
this
land
Swiftly
may
bear
back
again
Gandalf
spoke
now
Shadowfax
and
the
horse
set
off
good
pace
yet
not
beyond
the
measure
the
others
After
little
while
turned
suddenly
and
choosing
place
where
the
banks
were
lower
waded
the
river
and
then
led
them
away
due
south
into
flat
land
treeless
and
wide
The
wind
went
like
grey
waves
through
the
endless
miles
grass
There
was
sign
road
track
but
Shadowfax
did
not
stay
falter
steering
straight
course
now
for
the
halls
Théoden
under
the
slopes
the
White
Mountains
said
Gandalf
will
quicker
The
ground
firmer
the
Eastemnet
where
the
chief
northward
track
lies
across
the
river
but
Shadowfax
knows
the
way
through
every
fen
and
hollow
For
many
hours
they
rode
through
the
meads
and
riverlands
Often
the
grass
was
high
that
reached
above
the
knees
the
riders
and
their
steeds
seemed
swimming
grey
green
sea
They
came
upon
many
hidden
pools
and
broad
acres
sedge
waving
above
wet
and
treacherous
bogs
but
Shadowfax
found
the
way
and
the

Slowly
the
sun
fell
from
the
sky
down
into
the
West
Looking
out
over
the

plain
far
away
the
riders
saw
for
moment
like
red
fire
sinking
into

Low
upon

Chapter
THE
KING
THE
GOLDEN
BALL
They
rode
through
sunset
and
slow
dusk
and
gathering
night
When
last
they
halted
and
dismounted
even
Aragorn
was
stiff
and
weary
Gandalf
only
allowed
them
few
hours
rest
Legolas
and
Gimli
slept
and
Aragorn
lay
flat
stretched
upon
his
back
but
Gan
dalf
stood
leaning
his
staff
gazing
into
the
darkness
east
and
west
All
was
silent
and
there
was
sign
sound
living
thing
The
night
was
barred
with
long
clouds
fleeting
chill
wind
when
they
arose
again
Under
the
cold
moon
they
went
once
more
swift
the
light
day
Hours
passed
and
still
they
rode
Gimli
nodded
and
would
have
fallen
from
his
seat
Gandalf
had
not
clutched
and
shaken
him
Hasufel
and
Arod
weary
but
proud
followed
their
tireless
leader
grey
shadow
before
them
hardly
seen
The
miles
went
The
waxing
moon
sank
into
the
cloudy
West
bitter
chill
came
into
the
air
Slowly
the
East
the
dark
faded
cold
grey
Red
shafts
light
leapt
above
the
black
walls
the
Emyn
Muil
far
away
upon
their
left
Dawn
came
clear
and
bright
wind
swept
across
their
path
rushing
through
the
bent
grasses
Sud
denly
Shadowfax
stood
still
and
neighed
Gandalf
pointed
ahead
Look
cried
and
they
lifted
their
tired
eyes
Before
them
stood
the
mountains
the
South
white
tipped
and
streaked
with
black
The
grass
lands
rolled
against
the
hills
that
clustered
their
feet
and
flowed
into
many
valleys
still
dim
and
dark
untouched
the
light
dawn
winding
their
way
into
the
heart
the
great
mountains
Immediately
before
the
travellers
the
widest
these
glens
opened
like
long
gulf
among
the
hills
Far
inward
they
glimpsed
tumbled
mountain
mass
with
one
tall
peak
the
mouth
the
vale
there
stood
like
sentinel
lonely
height
About
its
feet
there
flowed
thread
silver
the
stream
that
issued
from
the
dale
upon
its
brow
they
caught
still
far
away
glint
the
rising
sun
glimmer
gold
Speak
Legolas
said
Gandalf
Tell
what
you
see
there
before
Legolas
gazed
ahead
shading
his
eyes
from
the
level
shafts
the
new
risen
sun
see
white
stream
that
comes
down
from
the
snows
said
Where
issues
from
the
shadow
the
vale
green
hill
THE
KING
THE
GOLDEN
HALL
507
rises
upon
the
east
dike
and
mighty
wall
and
thorny
fence
encircle
Within
there
rise
the
roofs
houses
and
the
midst
set
upon
green
terrace
there
stands
aloft
great
hall
Men
And
seems
eyes
that
thatched
with
gold
The
light
shines
far
over
the
land
Golden
too
are
the
posts
its
doors
There
men
bright
mail
stand
but
all
else
within
the
courts
are
yet
asleep
Edoras
those
courts
are
called
said
Gandalf
and
Meduseld
that
golden
hall
There
dwells
Théoden
son
Thengel
King
the
Mark
Rohan
are
come
with
the
rising
the
day
Now
the
road
lies
plain
see
before
But
must
ride
more
warily
for
war
abroad
and
the
Rohirrim
the
Horse
lords
not
sleep
even
seem
from
afar
Draw
weapon
speak
haughty
word
counsel
you
all
until
are
come
before
Théoden
seat
The
morning
was
bright
and
clear
about
them
and
birds
were
singing
when
the
travellers
came
the
stream
ran
down
swiftly
into
the
plain
and
beyond
the
feet
the
hills
turned
across
their
path
wide
bend
flowing
away
east
feed
the
Entwash
far
off
its
reed
choked
beds
The
land
was
green
the
wet
meads
and
along
the
grassy
borders
the
stream
grew
many
willow
trees
Already
this
southern
land
they
were
blushing
red
their
finger
tips
feeling
the
approach
spring
Over
the
stream
there
was
ford
between
low
banks
much
trampled
the
passage
horses
The
travellers
passed
over
and
came
upon
wide
rutted
track
leading
towards
the
uplands
the
foot
the
walled
hill
the
way
ran
under
the
shadow
many
mounds
high
and
green
Upon
their
western
sides
the
grass
was
white
with
drifted
snow
small
flowers
sprang
there
like
countless
stars
amid
the
turf
Look
said
Gandalf
How
fair
are
the
bright
eyes
the
grass
Evermind
they
are
called
stmbelmyné
this
land
Men
for
they
blossom
all
the
seasons
the
year
and
grow
where
dead
men
rest
Behold
are
come
the
great
barrows
where
the
sires
Theoden
sleep
Seven
mounds
upon
the
left
and
nine
upon
the
right
said
Aragorn
Many
long
lives
men
since
the
golden
hall
was
built
Five
hundred
times
have
the
red
leaves
fallen
Mirkwood
home
since
then
said
Legolas
and
but
little
while
does
that
seem
But
the
Riders
the
Mark
seems
long
ago
said
Aragorn
that
the
raising
this
house
but
memory
song
and
the
years
before
are
lost
the
mist
time
Now
they
call
this
land
their
home
their
own
and
their
speech
sundered
from
their
northern
kin
Then
began
chant
softly
slow
tongue
unknown
the
508
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Elf
and
Dwarf
yet
they
listened
for
there
was
strong
music
That
guess
the
language
the
Rohirrim
said
Legolas
for
like
this
land
itself
rich
and
rolling
part
and
else
hard
and
stern
the
mountains
But
cannot
guess
what
means
save
that
laden
with
the
sadness
Mortal
Men
runs
thus
the
Common
Speech
said
Aragorn
near
can
make
Where
now
the
horse
and
the
rider
Where
the
horn
that
was
blowing
Where
the
helm
and
the
hauberk
and
the
bright
hair
flowing
Where
the
hand
the
harpstring
and
the
red
fire
glowing
Where
the
spring
and
the
harvest
and
the
tall
corn
growing
They
have
passed
like
rain
the
mountain
like
wind
the
meadow
The
days
have
gone
down
the
West
behind
the
hills
into
shadow
Who
shall
gather
the
smoke
the
dead
wood
burning
behold
the
flowing
years
from
the
Sea
returning
Thus
spoke
forgotten
poet
long
ago
Rohan
recalling
how
tall
and
fair
was
Eorl
the
Young
who
rode
down
out
the
North
and
there
were
wings
upon
the
feet
his
steed
Felardf
father
horses
men
still
sing
the
evening
With
these
words
the
travellers
passed
the
silent
mounds
Follow
ing
the
winding
way
the
green
shoulders
the
hills
they
came
last
the
wide
wind
swept
walls
and
the
gates
Edoras
There
sat
many
men
bright
mail
who
sprang
once
their
feet
and
barred
the
way
with
spears
Stay
strangers
here
unknown
they
cried
the
tongue
the
Riddermark
demanding
the
names
and
errand
the
strangers
Wonder
was
their
eyes
but
little
friend
liness
and
they
looked
darkly
upon
Gandalf
Well
understand
your
speech
answered
the
same
language
yet
few
strangers
Why
then
you
not
speak
the
Common
Tongue
the
custom
the
West
you
wish
answered
the
will
Théoden
King
that
none
should
enter
his
gates
save
those
who
know
our
tongue
and
are
our
friends
replied
one
the
guards
None
are
welcome
here
days
war
but
our
own
folk
and
those
that
come
from
Mundburg
the
land
Gondor
Who
are
you
that
come
heedless
over
the
plain
thus
strangely
clad
riding
horses
like
our
own
horses
Long
have
kept
guard
here
and
have
watched
you
from
afar
Never
have
seen
other
riders
strange
nor
any
horse
more
proud
than
one
these
that
bear
you
one
the
Mearas
unless
our
eyes
are
cheated
some
spell
THE
KING
THE
GOLDEN
HALL
509
Say
are
you
not
wizard
some
spy
from
Saruman
phantoms
his
craft
Speak
now
and
swift
are
phantoms
said
Aragorn
nor
your
eyes
cheat
you
For
indeed
these
are
your
own
horses
that
ride
you
knew
well
ere
you
asked
guess
But
seldom
does
thief
ride
home
the
stable
Here
are
Hasufel
and
Arod
that
Eomer
the
Third
Marshal
the
Mark
lent
only
two
days
ago
bring
them
back
now
even
promised
him
Has
not
Eomer
then
returned
and
given
warning
our
coming
troubled
look
came
into
the
guard
eyes
Eomer
have
naught
say
answered
what
you
tell
truth
then
doubt
less
Théoden
will
have
heard
Maybe
your
coming
was
not
wholly
unlooked
for
but
two
nights
ago
that
Wormtongue
came
and
said
that
the
will
Théoden
stranger
should
pass
these
gates
Wormtongue
said
Gandalf
looking
sharply
the
guard
Say
more
errand
not
Wormtongue
but
the
Lord
the
Mark
himself
haste
Will
you
not
send
say
that
are
come
His
eyes
glinted
under
his
deep
brows
bent
his
gaze
upon
the
man
Yes
will
answered
slowly
But
what
names
shall
report
And
what
shall
say
you
Old
and
weary
you
seem
now
and
yet
you
are
fell
and
grim
beneath
deem
Well
you
see
and
speak
said
the
wizard
For
Gandalf
have
returned
And
behold
too
bring
back
horse
Here
Shadowfax
the
Great
whom
other
hand
can
tame
And
here
beside
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
the
heir
Kings
and
Mundburg
that
goes
Here
also
are
Legolas
the
Elf
and
Gimli
the
Dwarf
our
comrades
now
and
say
your
master
that
are
his
gates
and
would
have
speech
with
him
will
permit
come
into
his
hall
Strange
names
you
give
indeed
But
will
report
them
you
bid
and
learn
master
will
said
the
guard
Wait
here
little
while
and
will
bring
you
such
answer
seems
good
him
not
hope
too
much
These
are
dark
days
went
swiftly
away
leaving
the
strangers
the
watchful
keeping
his
comrades
After
some
time
returned
Follow
said
Théoden
gives
you
leave
enter
but
any
weapon
that
you
bear
only
staff
you
must
leave
the
threshold
The
doorwardens
will
keep
them
The
dark
gates
were
swung
open
The
travellers
entered
walking
file
behind
their
guide
They
found
broad
path
paved
with
hewn
stones
now
winding
upward
now
climbing
short
flights
well
laid
steps
Many
houses
built
wood
and
many
dark
doors
they
passed

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Beside
the
way
stone
channel
stream
clear
water
flowed
sparkling
and
chattering
length
they
came
the
crown
the
hill
There
stood
high
platform
above
green
terrace
the
foot
which
bright
spring
gushed
from
stone
carved
the
likeness
horse
head
beneath
was
wide
basin
from
which
the
water
spilled
and
fed
the
falling
stream
the
green
terrace
went
stair
stone
high
and
broad
and
either
side
the
topmost
step
were
stone
hewn
seats
There
sat
other
guards
with
drawn
swords
laid
upon
their
knees
Their
golden
hair
was
braided
their
shoulders
the
sun
was
blazoned
upon
their
green
shields
their
long
corslets
were
burnished
bright
and
when
they
rose
taller
they
seemed
than
mortal
men
There
are
the
doors
before
you
said
the
guide
must
return
now
duty
the
gate
Farewell
And
may
the
Lord
the
Mark
gracious
you
turned
and
went
swiftly
back
down
the
road
The
others
climbed
the
long
stair
under
the
eyes
the
tall
watchmen
Silent
they
stood
now
above
and
spoke
word
until
Gandalf
stepped
out
upon
the
paved
terrace
the
stair
head
Then
suddenly
with
clear
voices
they
spoke
courteous
greeting
their
own
tongue
Hail
comers
from
afar
they
said
and
they
turned
the
hilts
their
swords
towards
the
travellers
token
peace
Green
gems
flashed
the
sunlight
Then
one
the
guards
stepped
forward
and
spoke
the
Common
Speech
the
Doorward
Théoden
said
Hama
name
Here
must
bid
you
lay
aside
your
weapons
before
you
enter
Then
Legolas
gave
into
his
hand
his
silver
hafted
knife
his
quiver
and
his
bow
Keep
these
well
said
for
they
come
from
the
Golden
Wood
and
the
Lady
Lothlorien
gave
them
Wonder
came
into

and
laid

Hama

Hama
stepping
swiftly
before
the
doors
and
barring
the
way
His

was
now
his

and
the
point
towards
the
strangers
This

Gandalf
Needless

Aragorn
And

Whatever

Hama

Come
Aragorn
Slowly
Aragorn
unbuckled
his
belt
and
himself
set
his
sword
upright
against
the
wall
Here
set
said
but
command
you
not

The
guard
stepped
back
and
looked
with
amazement
Aragorn
seems
that
you
are
come

out

forgotten

said

and
laid
the
floor
Now
then
all

and
speak
with
your

The
guard
still
hesitated
Your

said
Gandalf
Forgive
but
that

must

the

Foolishness
said
Gandalf
Prudence

thing

Théoden

Every

But

Come

The

Hama
looked
hard
the

Gandalf
leaned
Yet

trust

You

The
guards
now
lifted
the
heavy
bars
the
doors
and
swung
them
slowly
inwards
grumbling
their
great
hinges
The
travellers
512
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
entered
Inside
seemed
dark
and
warm
after
the
clear
air
upon
the
hill
The
hall
was
long
and
wide
and
filled
with
shadows
and
half
lights
mighty
pillars
upheld
its
lofty
roof
But
here
and
there
bright
sunbeams
fell
glimmering
shafts
from
the
eastern
windows
high
under
the
deep
eaves
Through
the
louver
the
roof
above
the
thin
wisps
issuing
smoke
the
sky
showed
pale
and
blue
their
eyes
changed
the
travellers
perceived
that
the
floor
was
paved
with
stones
many
hues
branching
runes
and
strange
devices
intertwined
beneath
their
feet
They
saw
now
that
the
pillars
were
richly
carved
gleaming
dully
with
gold
and
half
seen
colours
Many
woven
cloths
were
hung
upon
the
walls
and
over
their
wide
spaces
marched
figures
ancient
legend
some
dim
with
years
some
darkling
the
shade
But
upon
one
form
the
sunlight
fell
young
man
upon
white
horse
was
blowing
great
horn
and
his
yellow
hair
was
flying
the
wind
The
horse
head
was
lifted
and
its
nostrils
were
wide
and
red
neighed
smelling
battle
afar
Foaming
water
green
and
white
rushed
and
curled
about
its
knees
Behold
Eorl
the
Young
said
Aragorn
Thus
rode
out
the
North
the
Battle
the
Field
Celebrant
Now
the
four
companions
went
forward
past
the
clear
wood
fire
burning
upon
the
long

the
midst
the
hall
Then
they
halted
the
far
end
the
house
beyond
the
hearth
and
facing
north
towards
the
doors
was
dais
with
three
steps
and
the
middle
the
dais
was
great
gilded
chair
Upon
sat
man
bent
with
age
that
seemed
almost
dwarf
but
his
white
hair
was
long
and
thick
and
fell
great
braids
from
beneath
thin
golden
circlet
set
upon
his
brow
the
centre
upon
his
forehead
shone
single
white
diamond
His
beard
was
laid
like
snow
upon
his
knees
but
his
eyes
still
burned
with
bright
light
glinting
gazed
the
strangers
Behind
his
chair
stood
woman
clad
white
his
feet
upon
the
steps
sat
wizened
figure
man
with
pale
wise
face
and
heavy
lidded
eyes
There
was
silence
The
old
man
did
not
move
his
chair
length
Gandalf
spoke
Hail
Théoden
son
Thengel
have
returned
For
behold
the
storm
comes
and
now
all
friends
should
gather
together
lest
each
singly
destroyed
Slowly
the
old
man
rose
his
feet
leaning
heavily
upon
short
black
staff
with
handle
white
bone
and
now
the
strangers
saw
that
bent
though
was
was
still
tall
and
must
youth
have
been
high
and
proud
indeed
greet
you
said
and
maybe
you
look
for
welcome
But
truth
tell
your
welcome
doubtful
here
Master
Gandalf
You
have
ever
been
herald
woe
Troubles
follow
you
like
crows
and
ever

oftener
the
worse
will
not
deceive
you
when
heard
that
Shadowfax
had
come
back
riderless
rejoiced
the
return
the
horse
but
still
more
the
lack
the
rider
and
when
Eomer
brought
the
tidings
that
you
had
gone
last
your
long
home
did
not
mourn
But
news
from
afar
seldom
sooth
Here
you
come
again
And
with
you
come
evils
worse
than
before
might
expected
Why
should
welcome
you
Gandalf
Stormcrow
Tell
that
Slowly
sat
down
again
his
chair
You
speak
justly
lord
said
the
pale
man
sitting
upon
the
steps
the
dais
not
yet
five
days
since
the
bitter
tidings
came
that
Théodred
your
son
was
slain
upon
the
West
Marches
your
right
hand
Second
Marshal
the
Mark
Eomer
there
little
trust
Few
men
would
left
guard
your
walls
had
been
allowed
rule
And
even
now
learn
from
Gondor
that
the
Dark
Lord
stirring
the
East
Such
the
hour
which
this
wanderer
chooses
return
Why
indeed
should
welcome
you
Master
Stormcrow
Lathspell
name
you
Ill
news
and
ill
news
ill
guest
they
say
laughed
grimly
lifted
his
heavy
lids
for
moment
and
gazed
the
strangers
with
dark
eyes
You
are
held
wise
friend
Wormtongue
and
are
doubtless
great
support
your
master
answered
Gandalf
soft
voice
Yet
two
ways
may
man
come
with
evil
tidings
may
worker
evil
may
such

well
alone
and
comes
only
bring
aid

That
said
Wormtongue
but
there
third
kind
pickers
bones
meddlers
other
men
sorrows
carrion
fowl
that
grow
fat
war
What
aid
have
you
ever
brought
Stormcrow
And
what
aid
you
bring
now
was
aid
from
that
you
sought
last
time
that
you
were
here
Then
lord
bade
you
choose
any
horse
that
you
would
and
gone
and
the
wonder
all
you
took
Shadowfax
your
insolence
lord
was
sorely
grieved
yet
some
seemed
that
speed
you
from
the
land
the
price
was
not
too
great
guess
that
likely
turn
out
the
same
once
more
you
will
seek
aid
rather
than
render
you
bring
men
you
bring
horses
swords
spears
That
would
call
aid
that
our
present
need
But
who
are
these
that
follow
your
tail
Three
ragged
wanderers
grey
and
you
yourself
the
most
beggar
like
the
four
The
courtesy
your
hall
somewhat
lessened
late
Theoden
son
Thengel
said
Gandalf
Has
not
the
messenger
from

reported
the

Seldom
has
any

Rohan
received
three
such

Weapons
they
have
laid
your

that
are
worth
many

even
the

Grey
their

for

and
thus
they
have
passed
through

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Then
true
Eomer
reported
that
you
are
league
with
the
Sorceress
the
Golden
Wood
said
Wormtongue
not
wondered
webs
deceit
were
ever
woven
Dwimordene
Gimli
strode
pace
forward
but
felt
suddenly
the
hand
Gandalf
clutch
him
the
shoulder
and
halted
standing
stiff
stone
Dwimordene
Lorien
Seldom
have
walked
the
feet
Men
Few
mortal
eyes
have
seen
the
light
That
lies
there
ever
long
and

Galadriel
Galadriel
Clear

Unmarred

Dwimordene
Lorien
More
fair
than

Mortal
Men
Thus
Gandalf
softly
sang
and
then
suddenly
changed
Casting
his
tattered
cloak
aside
stood
and
leaned
longer
his
staff
and
spoke
clear
cold
voice
The
wise
speak
only
what
they
know
Grima
son
Galmod
witless
worm
have
you
become
Therefore
silent
and
keep
your
forked
tongue
behind
your
teeth
have
not
passed
through
fire
and
death
bandy
crooked
words
with
serving
man
till
the
lightning
falls
raised
his
staff
There
was
roll
thunder
The
sunlight
was
blotted
out
from
the
eastern
windows
the
whole
hall
became
sud
denly
dark
night
The
fire
faded
sullen
embers
Only
Gandalf
could
seen
standing
white
and
tall
before
the
blackened
hearth
the
gloom
they
heard
the
hiss
Wormtongue
voice
Did
not
counsel
you
lord
forbid
his
staff
That
fool
Hama
has
betrayed
There
was
flash
lightning
had
cloven
the
roof
Then
all
was
silent
Wormtongue
sprawled
his
face
Now
Théoden
son
Thengel
will
you
hearken
said
Gandalf
you
ask
for
help
lifted
his
staff
and
pointed
high
window
There
the
darkness
seemed
clear
and
through
the
opening
could
seen
high
and
far
patch
shining
sky
Not
all
dark
Take
courage
Lord
the
Mark
for
better
help
you
will
not
find
counsel
have
give
those
that
despair
Yet
counsel
could
give
and
words
could
speak
you
Will
you
hear
them
They
are
not
for
all
ears
bid
you
come
out
before
your
doors
and
look
abroad
Too
long
have
you
sat
shadows
and
trusted
twisted
tales
and
crooked
promptings
THE
KING
THE
GOLDEN
HALL
515
Slowly
Théoden
left
his
chair
faint
light
grew
the
hall
again
The
woman
hastened
the
king
side
taking
his
arm
and
with
faltering
steps
the
old
man
came
down
from
the
dais
and
paced
softly
through
the
hall
Wormtongue
remained
lying
the
floor
They
came
the
doors
and
Gandalf
knocked
Open
cried
The
Lord
the
Mark
comes
forth
The
doors
rolled
back
and
keen
air
came
whistling
wind
was
blowing
the
hill
Send
your
guards
down
the
stairs
foot
said
Gandalf
And
you
lady
leave
him
while
with
will
care
for
him
Eowyn
sister
daughter
said
the
old
king
The
time
for
fear
past
The
woman
turned
and
went
slowly
into
the
house
she
passed
the
doors
she
turned
and
looked
back
Grave
and
thoughtful
was
her
glance
she
looked
the
king
with
cool
pity
her
eyes
Very
fair
was
her
face
and
her
long
hair
was
like
river
gold
Slender
and
tall
she
was
her
white
robe
girt
with
silver
but
strong
she
seemed
and
stern
steel
daughter
kings
Thus
Aragorn
for
the
first
time
the
full
light
day
beheld
Eowyn
Lady
Rohan
and
thought
her
fair
fair
and
cold
like
morning
pale
spring
that
not
yet
come
womanhood
And
she
now
was
suddenly
aware
him
tall
heir
kings
wise
with
many
winters
greycloaked
hiding
power
that
yet
she
felt
For
moment
still
stone
she
stood
then
turning
swiftly
she
was
gone
Now
lord
said
Gandalf
look
out
upon
your
land
Breathe
the
free
air
again
From
the
porch
upon
the
top
the
high
terrace
they
could
see
beyond
the
stream
the
green
fields
Rohan
fading
into
distant
grey
Curtains
wind
blown
rain
were
slanting
down
The
sky
above
and
the
west
was
still
dark
with
thunder
and
lightning
far
away
flickered
among
the
tops
hidden
hills
But
the
wind
had
shifted
the
north
and
already
the
storm
that
had
come
out
the
East
was
receding
rolling
away
southward
the
sea
Suddenly
through
rent
the
clouds
behind
them
shaft
sun
stabbed
down
The
falling
showers
gleamed
like
silver
and
far
away
the
river
glittered
like
shimmering
glass
not
dark
here
said
Théoden
said
Gandalf
Nor
does
age
lie
heavily
your
shoulders
some
would
have
you
think
Cast
aside
your
prop
From
the
king
hand
the
black
staff
fell
clattering
the
stones
drew
himself
slowly
man
that
stiff
from
long
bending
over
some
dull
toil
Now
tall
and
straight
stood
and
his
eyes
were
blue
looked
into
the
opening

Dark

Not

now
shall
stand
the

Fire

What

Much
said
Gandalf
But
first
send
for
Eomer
not
guess
rightly
that
you
hold
him
prisoner
the
counsel
Grima
him
that
all
save
you
name
the
Wormtongue
true
said
Théoden
had
rebelled
against
commands
and
threatened
death
Grima
hall
man
may
love
you
and
yet
not
love
Wormtongue
his
coun
sels
said
Gandalf
That
may
will
you
ask
Call
Hama
Since
proved
untrusty
doorward
let
him
become
errand
runner
The
guilty
shall
bring
the
guilty
judgement
said
Theoden
and
his
voice
was
grim
yet
looked
Gandalf
and
smiled
and
did
many
lines
care
were
smoothed
away
and
did
not
return
When
Hama
had
been
summoned
and
had
gone
Gandalf
led
Théoden
stone
seat
and
then
sat
himself
before
the
king
upon
the
topmost
stair
Aragorn
and
his
companions
stood
nearby
There
time
tell
all
that
you
should
hear
said
Gandalf
Yet
hope
not
cheated
time
will
come
ere
long
when
can
speak
more
fully
Behold
you
are
come
into
peril
greater
even
than
the
wit
Wormtongue
could
weave
into
your
dreams
But
see
you
dream
longer
You
live
Gondor
and
Rohan
not
stand
alone
The
enemy
strong
beyond
our
reckoning
yet
have
hope
which
has
not
guessed
Quickly
now
Gandalf
spoke
His
voice
was
low
and
secret
and
none
save
the
king
heard
what
said
But
ever
spoke
the
light
shone
brighter
Théoden
eye
and
the
last
rose
from
his
seat
his
full
height
and
Gandalf
beside
him
and
together
they
looked
out
from
the
high
place
towards
the
East
Verily
said
Gandalf
now
loud
voice
keen
and
clear
that
way
lies
our
hope
where
sits
our
greatest
fear
Doom
hangs
still
thread
Yet
hope
there
still
can
but
stand
unconquered
for
little
while
The
others
too
now
turned
their
eyes
eastward
Over
the
sundering
leagues
land
far
away
they
gazed
the
edge
sight
and
hope
and
fear
bore
their
thoughts
still
beyond
dark
mountains
the
Land
Shadow
Where
now
was
the
Ring
bearer
How
thin
indeed
was
the
thread
upon
which
doom
still
hung
seemed
Legolas
strained
his
farseeing
eyes
that
caught
glint
white
far
away
perchance

sun
twinkled

Tower

517
Guard
And
further
still
endlessly
remote
and
yet
present
threat
there
was
tiny
tongue
flame
Slowly
Théoden
sat
down
again
weariness
still
struggled
master
him
against
the
will
Gandalf
turned
and
looked
his
great
house
Alas
said
that
these
evil
days
should
mine
and
should
come
old
age
instead
that
peace
which
have
earned
Alas
for
Boromir
the
brave
The
young
perish
and
the
old
linger
withering
clutched
his
knees
with
his
wrinkled
hands
Your
fingers
would
remember
their
old
strength
better
they
grasped
sword
hilt
said
Gandalf
Theoden
rose
and
put
his
hand
his
side
but
sword
hung
his
belt
Where
has
Grima
stowed
muttered
under
his
breath
Take
this
dear
lord
said
clear
voice
was
ever
your
service
Two
men
had
come
softly
the
stair
and
stood
now
few
steps
from
the
top
Eomer
was
there
helm
was
his
head
mail
was
his
breast
but
his
hand
held
drawn
sword
and
knelt
offered
the
hilt
his
master
How
comes
this
said
Théoden
sternly
turned
towards
Eomer
and
the
men
looked
wonder
him
standing
now
proud
and
erect
Where
was
the
old
man
whom
they
had
left
crouching
his
chair
leaning
his
stick
doing
lord
said
Hama
trembling
understood
that
Eomer
was
set
free
Such
joy
was
heart
that
maybe
have
erred
Yet
since
was
free
again
and
Marshal
the
Mark
brought
him
his
sword
bade
lay
your
feet
lord
said
Eomer
For
moment
silence
Théoden
stood
looking
down
Eomer
knelt
still
before
him
Neither
moved
Will
you
not
take
the
sword
said
Gandalf
Slowly
Théoden
stretched
forth
his
hand
his
fingers
took
the
hilt
seemed
the
watchers
that
firmness
and
strength
returned
his
thin
arm
Suddenly
lifted
the
blade
and
swung
shimmering
and
whistling
the
air
Then
gave
great
cry
His
voice
rang
clear
chanted
the
tongue
Rohan

Arise
now
arise
Riders
Théoden
Dire

Forth

The
guards
thinking
that
they
were
summoned
sprang
the
stair
They
looked
their
lord
amazement
and
then
one
man
they
drew
their
swords
and
laid
them
his
feet
Command
they
said
518
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Westu
Théoden
hdl
cried
Eomer
joy
see
you
return
into
your
own
Never
again
shall
said
Gandalf
that
you
come
only
with
grief
Take
back
your
sword
Eomer
sister
son
said
the
king
Hama
and
seek
own
sword
Grima
has
his
keeping
Bring
him
also
Now
Gandalf
you
said
that
you
had
counsel
give
would
hear
What
your
counsel
You
have
yourself
already
taken
answered
Gandalf
put
your
trust
Eomer
rather
than
man
crooked
mind
cast
aside
regret
and
fear
the
deed
hand
Every
man
that
can
ride
should
sent
west
once
Eomer
counselled
you
must
first
destroy
the
threat
Saruman
while
have
time
fail
fall
succeed
then
will
face
the
next
task
Meanwhile
your
people
that
are
left
the
women
and
the
children
and
the
old
should
fly
the
refuges
that
you
have
the
mountains
Were
they
not
prepared
against
just
such
evil
day
this
Let
them
take
provision
but
delay
not
nor
burden
themselves
with
treasures
great
small
their
lives
that
are
stake
This
counsel
seems
good
now
said
Théoden
Let
all
folk
get
ready
But
you
guests
truly
you
said
Gandalf
that
the
courtesy
hall
lessened
You
have
ridden
through
the
night
and
the
morning
wears
away
You
have
had
neither
sleep
nor
food
guest
house
shall
made
ready
there
you
shall
sleep
when
you
have
eaten
Nay
lord
said
Aragorn
There
rest
yet
for
the
weary
The
men
Rohan
must
ride
forth
today
and
will
ride
with
them
axe
sword
and
bow
did
not
bring
them
rest
against
your
wall
Lord
the
Mark
And
promised
Eomer
that
sword
and
his
should
drawn
together
Now
indeed
there
hope
victory
said
Eomer
Hope
yes
said
Gandalf
But
Isengard
strong
And
other
perils
draw
ever
nearer
not
delay
Théoden
when
are
gone
Lead
your
people
swiftly

Hold

Nay
Gandalf
said
the
king
You
not
know
your
own
skill

fall

front
the

Thus
shall
sleep
better
Then
even

glorious
song
said
Aragorn
The
armed
men
that
stood
near
clashed
their
weapons
crying
The
Lord
the
Mark
will
ride
Forth
Eorlingas
But
your
people
must
not
both
unarmed
and
shepherdless
said
Gandalf
Who
shall
guide
them
and
govern
them
your
place
will
take
thought
for
that
ere
answered
Theoden
Here
comes
counsellor
THE
KING
THE
GOLDEN
HALL
519
that
moment
Hama
came
again
from
the
hall
Behind
him
cringing
between
two
other
men
came
Grima
the
Wormtongue
His
face
was
very
white
His
eyes
blinked
the
sunlight
Hama
knelt
and
presented
Théoden
long
sword
scabbard
clasped
with
gold
and
set
with
green
gems
Here
lord
Herugrim
your
ancient
blade
said
was
found
his
chest
Loth
was
render
the
keys
Many
other
things
are
there
which
men
have
missed
You
lie
said
Wormtongue
And
this
sword
your
master
himself
gave
into
keeping
And
now
requires
you
again
said
Théoden
Does
that
displease
you
Assuredly
not
lord
said
Wormtongue
care
for
you
and
yours
best
may
But
not
weary
yourself
tax
too
heavily
your
strength
Let
others
deal
with
these
irksome
guests
Your
meat
about
set
the
board
Will
you
not
will
said
Théoden
And
let
food
for
guests
set
the
board
beside
The
host
rides
today
Send
the
heralds
forth
Let
them
summon
all
who
dwell
nigh
Every
man
and
strong
lad
able
bear
arms
all
who
have
horses
let
them
ready
the
saddle
the
gate
ere
the
second
hour
from
noon
Dear
lord
cried
Wormtongue
feared
This
wizard
has
bewitched
you
Are
none
left
defend
the
Golden
Hall
your
fathers
and
all
your
treasure
None
guard
the
Lord
the
Mark
this
bewitchment
said
Théoden
seems
more
whole
some
than
your
whisperings
Your
leechcraft
ere
long
would
have
had
walking
all
fours
like
beast
not
one
shall
left
not
even
Grima
Grima
shall
ride
too
You
have
yet
time
clean
the
rust
from
your
sword
Mercy
lord
whined
Wormtongue
grovelling
the
ground
Have
pity
one
worn
out
your
service
Send
not
from
your
side
least
will
stand
you
when
all
others
have
gone
not
send
your
faithful
Grima
away
You
have
pity
said
Theoden
And
not
send
you
from
side
myself
war
with
men
bid
you
come
with
and
prove
your
faith
Wormtongue
looked
from
face
face
his
eyes
was
the
hunted
look
beast
seeking
some
gap
the
ring
his
enemies
licked
his
lips
with
long
pale
tongue
Such
resolve
might
expected
from
lord
the
House
Eorl
old
though
said
But
those
who
truly
love
him
would
spare
his
failing
years
Yet
see
that
come
too
late
Others
whom
the
death
lord
would
perhaps
grieve
less
have
already
persuaded
him
cannot
undo
their

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
work
hear
least
this
lord
One
who
knows
your
mind
and
honours
your
commands
should
left
Edoras
Appoint
faithful
steward
Let
your
counsellor
Grima
keep
all
things
till
your
return
and
pray
that
may
see
though
wise
man
will
deem
hopeful
Eomer
laughed
And
that
plea
does
not
excuse
you
from
war
most
noble
Wormtongue
said
what
office
less
honour
would
you
accept
carry
sack
meal
into
the
mountains
any
man
would
trust
you
with
Nay
Eomer
you
not
fully
understand
the
mind
Master
Wormtongue
said
Gandalf
turning
his
piercing
glance
upon
him
bold
and
cunning
Even
now
plays
game
with
peril
and
wins
throw
Hours
precious
time
has
wasted
already
Down
snake
said
suddenly
terrible
voice
Down
your
belly
How
long
since
Saruman
bought
you
What
was
the
promised
price
When
all
the
men
were
dead
you
were
pick
your
share
the
treasure
and
take
the
woman
you
desire
Too
long
have
you
watched
her
under
your
eyelids
and
haunted
her
steps
Eomer
grasped
his
sword
That
knew
already
muttered
For
that
reason
would
have
slain
him
before
forgetting
the
law
the
hall
But
there
are
other
reasons
stepped
forward
but
Gandalf
stayed
him
with
his
hand
Eowyn
safe
now
said
But
you
Wormtongue
you
have
done
what
you
could
for
your
true
master
Some
reward
you
have
earned
least
Yet
Saruman
apt
overlook
his
bargains
should
advise
you
quickly
and
remind
him
lest
forget
your
faithful
service
You
lie
said
Wormtongue
That
word
comes
too
oft
and
easy
from
your
lips
said
Gandalf
not
lie
See
Theoden
here
snake
With
safety
you
cannot
take
with
you
nor
can
you
leave
behind
slay
would
just
But
was
not
always
now
Once
was
man
and
did
you
service
its
fashion
Give
him
horse
and
let
him
once
wherever
chooses
his
choice
you
shall
judge
him
you
hear
this
Wormtongue
said
Théoden
This
your
choice
ride
with
war
and
let
see
battle
whether
you
are
true
now
whither
you
will
But
then
ever
meet
again
shall
not
merciful
Slowly
Wormtongue
rose
looked
them
with
half
closed
eyes
Last
all
scanned
Théoden
face
and
opened
his
mouth
speak
Then
suddenly
drew
himself
His
hands
worked
His
eyes
glittered
Such
malice
was
them
that
men
stepped
back
from
him
bared
his
teeth
and
then
with
hissing
breath
spat
before
the
king
feet
and
darting
one
side
fled
down
the
stair
THE
KING
THE
GOLDEN
HALL
521
After
him
said
Théoden
See
that
does
harm
any
but
not
hurt
him
hinder
him
Give
him
horse
wishes
And
any
will
bear
him
said
Eomer
One
the
guards
ran
down
the
stair
Another
went
the
well
the
foot
the
terrace
and
his
helm
drew
water
With
washed
clean
the
stones
that
Wormtongue
had
defiled
Now
guests
come
said
Theoden
Come
and
take
such
refreshment
haste
allows
They
passed
back
into
the
great
house
Already
they
heard
below
them
the
town
the
heralds
crying
and
the
war
horns
blowing
For
the
king
was
ride
forth
soon
the
men
the
town
and
those
dwelling
near
could
armed
and
assembled
the
king
board
sat
Eomer
and
the
four
guests
and
there
also
waiting
upon
the
king
was
the
lady
Eowyn
They
ate
and
drank
swiftly
The
others
were
silent
while
Théoden
questioned
Gandalf
concerning
Saruman
How
far
back
his
treachery
goes
who
can
guess
said
Gandalf
was
not
always
evil
Once
not
doubt
that
was
the
friend
Rohan
and
even
when
his
heart
grew
colder
found
you
useful
still
But
for
long
now
has
plotted
your
ruin
wearing
the
mask
friendship
until
was
ready
those
years
Wormtongue
task
was
easy
and
all
that
you
did
was
swiftly
known
Isengard
for
your
land
was
open
and
strangers
came
and
went
And
ever
Wormtongue
whispering
was
your
ears
poisoning
your
thought
chilling
your
heart
weakening
your
limbs
while
others
watched
and
could
nothing
for
your
will
was
his
keeping
But
when
escaped
and
warned
you
then
the
mask
was
torn
for
those
who
would
see
After
that
Wormtongue
played
dangerously
always
seeking
delay
you
prevent
your
full
strength
being
gath
ered
was
crafty
dulling
men
wariness
working
their
fears
served
the
occasion
you
not
remember
how
eagerly
urged
that
man
should
spared
wildgoose
chase
northward
when
the
immediate
peril
was
westward
persuaded
you
forbid
Eomer
pursue
the
raiding
Orcs
Eomer
had
not
defied
Wormtongue
voice
speaking
with
your
mouth
those
Orcs
would
have
reached
Isengard
now
bearing
great
prize
Not
indeed
that
prize
which
Saruman
desires
above
all
else
but
the
least
two
members
Company
sharers
secret
hope
which
even
you
lord
cannot
yet
speak
openly
Dare
you
think
what
they
might
now
suffering
what
Saruman
might
now
have
learned
our
destruction
owe
much
Eomer
said
Théoden
Faithful
heart
may
have
froward
tongue
522
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Say
also
said
Gandalf
that
crooked
eyes
truth
may
wear
wry
face
Indeed
eyes
were
almost
blind
said
Théoden
Most
all
owe
you
guest
Once
again
you
have
come
time
would
give
you
gift
ere
your
own
choosing
You
have
only
name
aught
that
mine
reserve
now
only
sword
Whether
came
time
not
yet
seen
said
Gandalf
But
for
your
gift
lord
will
choose
one
that
will
fit
need
swift
and
sure
Give
Shadowfax
was
only
lent
before
loan
may
call
But
now
shall
ride
him
into
great
hazard
setting
silver
against
black
would
not
risk
anything
that
not
own
And
already
there
bond
love
between
You
choose
well
said
Théoden
and
give
him
now
gladly
Yet
great
gift
There
none
like
Shadowfax
him
one
the
mighty
steeds
old
has
returned
None
such
shall
return
again
And
you
other
guests
will
offer
such
things
may
found
armoury
Swords
you
not
need
but
there
are
helms
and
coats
mail
cunning
work
gifts
fathers
out
Gondor
Choose
from
these
ere
and
may
they
serve
you
welll
Now
men
came
bearing
raiment
war
from
the
king
hoard
and
they
arrayed
Aragorn
and
Legolas
shining
mail
Helms
too
they
chose
and
round
shields
their
bosses
were
overlaid
with
gold
and
set
with
gems
green
and
red
and
white
Gandalf
took
armour
and
Gimli
needed
coat
rings
even
one
had
been
found
match
his
stature
for
there
was
hauberk
the
hoards
Edoras
better
make
than
his
short
corslet
forged
beneath
the
Mountain
the
North
But
chose
cap
iron
and
leather
that
fitted
well
upon
his
round
head
and
small
shield
also
took
bore
the
running
horse
white
upon
green
that
was
the
emblem
the
House
Eorl
May
keep
you
well
said
Théoden
was
made
for
Thengel
day
while
still
was
boy
Gimli
bowed
proud
Lord
the
Mark
bear
your
device
said
Indeed
sooner
would
bear
horse
than
borne
one
love
feet
better
But
maybe
shall
come
yet
where
can
stand
and
fight
may
well
said
Theoden
The
king
now
rose
and
once
Eowyn
came
forward
bearing
wine
Ferthu
Théoden
hal
she
said
Receive
now
this
cup
and
drink
happy
hour
Health
with
thee
thy
going
and
coming
Theoden
drank
from
the
cup
and
she
then
proffered
the
guests
she
stood
before
Aragorn
she
paused
suddenly
and
looked
upon
him
and
her
eyes
were
shining
And
looked
down
upon
her

KING

GOLDEN
HALL
523
fair
face
and
smiled
but
took
the
cup
his
hand
met
hers
and
knew
that
she
trembled
the
touch
Hail
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
she
said
Hail
Lady
Rohan
answered
but
his
face
now
was
troubled
and
did
not
smile
When
they
had
all
drunk
the
king
went
down
the
hall
the
doors
There
the
guards
awaited
him
and
heralds
stood
and
all
the
lords
and
chiefs
were
gathered
together
that
remained
Edoras
dwelt
nearby
Behold

and

Which

none
whom
you

the

Eorl
answered
Hama
But
Eomer
cannot
spare
nor
would
stay
said
the
king
and
the
last
that
House
said
not
Eomer
answered
Hama
And
not
the
last
There
Eowyn
daughter
Eomund
his
sister
She
fearless
and
high
hearted
All
love
her
Let
her
lord

Eorlingas
while
are
gone
shall
said
Théoden
Let
the
heralds
announce
the
folk
that
the
Lady
Eowyn
will
lead
them
Then
the
king
sat
upon
seat
before
his
doors
and
Eowyn
knelt
before
him
and
received
from
him
sword
and
fair
corslet
Farewell
sister
daughter
said
Dark
the
hour
yet
maybe
shall
return
the
Golden
Hall
But
Dunharrow
the
people
may
long
defend
themselves
and
the
battle
ill
thither
will
come
all
who
escape
Speak
not
she
answered
year
shall
endure
for
every
day
that
passes
until
your
return
But
she
spoke
her
eyes
went
Aragorn
who
stood
nearby
The
king
shall
come
again
said
Fear
not
Not
West
but
East
does
our
doom
await
The
king
now
went
down
the
stair
with
Gandalf
beside
him
The
others
followed
Aragorn
looked
back
they
passed
towards
the
gate
Alone
Eowyn

the

was
set
upright

and
her

were
laid
upon

She
was

shone
like

Gimli
patting

his

the
gate
they
found
great
host
men
old
and
young
all
ready
the
saddle
More
than
thousand
were
there
mustered
Their
spears
were
like
springing
wood
Loudly
and
joyously
they
shouted
Théoden
came
forth
Some
held
readiness
the
king

Snowmane
and
others
held
the
horses
Aragorn
and
Legolas
Gimli
stood
ill
ease
frowning
but
Eomer
came
him
leading
his
horse
Hail
Gimli
Gloin

cried

But

the

Eomer

Gimli

Eomer
Legolas

Where
Shadowfax
said
Gandalf
Running
wild
over
the
grass
they
answered
will
let
man
handle
him
There
goes
away
down
the
ford
like
shadow
among
the
willows
Gandalf
whistled
and
called
aloud
the
horse
name
and
far
away
tossed
his
head
and
neighed
and
turning
sped
towards
the
host
like
arrow
Were

West
Wind

said
Eomer
the

said
Gandalf
Then
suddenly
threw
back
his
grey
cloak
and
cast
aside
his
hat
and
leaped
horseback
wore
helm
nor
mail
His
snowy
hair
flew
free
the
wind
his
white
robes
shone
dazzling
the

Behold

cried
Aragorn
and
all

Forth

The

Then
the

raised

and
with
rush
like

great

the

rode
thundering
into

Chapter
HELM
DEEP
The
sun
was
already
westering
they
rode
from
Edoras
and
the
light
was
their
eyes
turning
all
the
rolling
fields
Rohan
golden
haze
There
was
beaten
way
north
westward
along
the
foot
hills
the
White
Mountains
and
this
they
followed
and
down
green
country
crossing
small
swift
streams
many
fords
Far
ahead
and
their
right
the
Misty
Mountains
loomed
ever
darker
and
taller
they
grew
the
miles
went
The
sun
went
slowly
down
before
them
Evening
came
behind
The
host
rode
Need
drove
them
Fearing
come
too
late
they
rode
with
all
the
speed
they
could
pausing
seldom
Swift
and
enduring
were
the
steeds
Rohan
but
there
were
many
leagues
Forty
leagues
and
more
was
bird
flies
from
Edoras
the
fords
the
Isen
where
they
hoped
find
the
king
men
that
held
back
the
hosts
Saruman
Night
closed
about
them
last
they
halted
make
their
camp
They
had
ridden
for
some
five
hours
and
were
far
out
upon
the
western
plain
yet
more
than
half
their
journey
lay
still
before
them
great
circle
under
the
starry
sky
and
the
waxing
moon
they
now
made
their
bivouac
They
lit
fires
for
they
were
certain
events
but
they
set
ring
mounted
guards
about
them
and
scouts
rode
out
far
ahead
passing
like
shadows
the
folds
the
land
The
slow
night
passed
without
tidings
alarm
dawn
the
horns
sounded
and
within
hour
they
took
the
road
again
There
were
clouds
overhead
yet
but
heaviness
was
the
air
was
hot
for
the
season
the
year
The
rising
sun
was
hazy
and
behind
following
slowly
the
sky
there
was
growing
darkness
great
storm
moving
out
the
East
And
away
the
North
west
there
seemed
another
darkness
brooding
about
the
feet
the
Misty
Mountains
shadow
that
crept
down
slowly
from
the
Wizard
Vale
Gandalf
dropped
back
where
Legolas
rode
beside
Eomer
You
have
the
keen
eyes
your
fair
kindred
Legolas
said
and
they
can
tell
sparrow
from
finch
league
off
Tell
can
you
see
anything
away
yonder
towards
Isengard
Many
miles
lie
between
said
Legolas
gazing
thither
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
long
hand
can
see
darkness
There
are
shapes
HELM
DEEP
527
moving
great
shapes
far
away
upon
the
bank
the
river
but
what
they
are
cannot
tell
not
mist
cloud
that
defeats
eyes
there
veiling
shadow
that
some
power
lays
upon
the
land
and
marches
slowly
down
stream
the
twilight
under
endless
trees
were
flowing
downwards
from
the
hills
And
behind
comes
very
storm
Mordor
said
Gandalf
will
black
night
the
second
day
their
riding
drew
the
heaviness
the
air
increased
the
afternoon
the
dark
clouds
began
overtake
them
sombre
canopy
with
great
billowing
edges
flecked
with
dazzling
light
The
sun
went
down
blood
red
smoking
haze
The
spears
the
Riders
were
tipped
with
fire
the
last
shafts
light
kindled
the
steep
faces
the
peaks
Thrihyrne
now
very
near
they
stood
the
northernmost
arm
the
White
Mountains
three
jagged
horns
staring
the
sunset
the
last
red
glow
men
the
vanguard
saw
black
speck
horseman
riding
back
towards
them
They
halted
awaiting
him
came
weary
man
with
dinted
helm
and
cloven
shield
Slowly
climbed
from
his
horse
and
stood
there
while
gasping
length
spoke
Eomer
here
asked
You
come
last
but
too
late
and
with
too
little
strength
Things
have
gone
evilly
since
Théodred
fell
were
driven
back
yesterday
over
the
Isen
with
great
loss
many
perished
the
crossing
Then
night
fresh
forces
came
over
the
river
against
our
camp
All
Isengard
must
emptied
and
Saruman
has
armed
the
wild
hillmen
and
herd
folk
Dunland
beyond
the
rivers
and
these
also
loosed
upon
were
over
mastered
The
shield
wall
was
broken
Erkenbrand
Westfold
has
drawn
off
those
men
could
gather
towards
his
fastness
Helm
Deep
The
rest
are
scattered
Where
Eomer
Tell
him
there
hope
ahead
should
return
Edoras
before
the
wolves
Isengard
come
there
Théoden
had
sat
silent
hidden
from
the
man
sight
behind
his
guards
now
urged
his
horse
forward
Come
stand
before
Ceorl
said
here
The
last
host
the
Eorlingas
has
ridden
forth
will
not
return
without
battle
The
man
face
lightened
with
joy
and
wonder
drew
himself
Then
knelt
offering
his
notched
sword
the
king
Command
lord
cried
And
pardon
thought
You
thought
remained
Meduseld
bent
like
old
tree
under
winter
snow
was
when
you
rode
war
But
west
wind
has
shaken
the
boughs
said
Théoden
Give
this
man
fresh
horse
Let
ride
the
help
Erkenbrand
528
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
While
Théoden
was
speaking
Gandalf
rode
short
way
ahead
and
sat
there
alone
gazing
north
Isengard
and
west
the
setting
sun
Now
came
back
Ride
Theoden
said
Ride
Helm
Deep
not
the
Fords
Isen
and
not
tarry
the
plain
must
leave
you
for
while
Shadowfax
must
bear
now
swift
errand
Turning
Aragorn
and
Eomer
and
the
men
the
king
household
cried
Keep
well
the
Lord
the
Mark
till
return
Await
Helm
Gate
Farewell
spoke
word
Shadowfax
and
like
arrow
from
the
bow
the
great
horse
sprang
away
Even
they
looked
was
gone
flash
silver
the
sunset
wind
over
the
grass
shadow
that
fled
and
passed
from
sight
Snowmane
snorted
and
reared
eager
fol
low
but
only
swift
bird
the
wing
could
have
overtaken
him
What
does
that
mean
said
one
the
guard
Hama
That
Gandalf
Greyhame
has
need
haste
answered
Hama
Ever
goes
and
comes
unlooked
for
Wormtongue
were
here
would
not
find
hard
explain
said
the
other
True
enough
said
Hama
but
for
myself
will
wait
until
see
Gandalf
again
Maybe
you
will
wait
long
said
the
other
The
host
turned
away
now
from
the
road
the
Fords
Isen
and
bent
their
course
southward
Night
fell
and
still
they
rode
The
hills
drew
near
but
the
tall
peaks
Thrihyrne
were
already
dim
against
the
darkening
sky
Still
some
miles
away
the
far
side
the
Westfold
Vale
great
bay
the
mountains
lay
green
coomb
out
which
gorge
opened
the
hills
Men
that
land
called
Helm
Deep
after
hero
old
wars
who
had
made
his
refuge
there
Ever
steeper
and
narrower
wound
inward
from
the
north
under
the
shadow
the
Thrihyrne
till
the
crowhaunted
cliffs
rose
like
mighty
towers
either
side
shutting
out
the
light
Helm
Gate
before
the
mouth
the
Deep
there
was
heel
rock
thrust
outward
the
northern
cliff
There
upon
its
spur
stood
high
walls
ancient
stone
and
within
them
was
lofty
tower
Men
said
that
the
far
off
days
the
glory
Gondor
the
sea
kings
had
built
here
this
fastness
with
the
hands
giants
The
Hornburg
was
called
for
trumpet
sounded
upon
the
tower
echoed
the
Deep
behind
armies
long
forgotten
were
issuing
war
from
caves
beneath
the
hills
wall
too
the
men
old
had
made
from
the
Hornburg
the
southern
cliff
barring
the
entrance
the
gorge
Beneath
wide
culvert
the
Deeping
stream
passed
out
About
HELM
DEEP
529
the
feet
the
Hornrock
wound
and
flowed
then
gully
through
the
midst
wide
green
gore
sloping
gently
down
from
Helm
Gate
Helm
Dike
Thence
fell
into
the
Deeping
coomb
and
out
into
the
Westfold
Vale
There
the
Hornburg
Helm
Gate
Erkenbrand
master
Westfold
the
borders
the
Mark
now
dwelt
the
days
darkened
with
threat
war
being
wise
had
repaired
the
wall
and
made
the
fastness
strong
The
Riders
were
still
the
low
valley
before
the
mouth
the
Coomb
when
cries
and
hornblasts
were
heard
from
their
scouts
that
went
front
Out
the
darkness
arrows
whistled
Swiftly
scout
rode
back
and
reported
that
wolf
riders
were
abroad
the
valley
and
that
host
Orcs
and
wild
men
were
hurrying
southward
from
the
Fords
Isen
and
seemed
making
for
Helm
Deep
have
found
many
our
folk
lying
slain
they
fled
thither
said
the
scout
And
have
met
scattered
companies
going
this
way
and
that
leaderless
What
has
become
Erkenbrand
none
seem
know
likely
that
will
overtaken
ere
can
reach
Helm
Gate
has
not
already
perished
Has
aught
been
seen
Gandalf
asked
Théoden
Yes
lord
Many
have
seen
old
man
white
upon
horse
passing
hither
and
thither
over
the
plains
like
wind
the
grass
Some
thought
was
Saruman
said
that
went
away
ere
nightfall
towards
Isengard
Some
say
also
that
Wormtongue
was
seen
earlier
going
northward
with
company
Orcs
will
ill
with
Wormtongue
Gandalf
comes
upon
him
said
Théoden
Nonetheless
miss
now
both
counsellors
the
old
and
the
new
But
this
need
have
better
choice
than
Gandalf
said
Helm
Gate
whether
Erkenbrand
there
known
how
great
the
host
that
comes
from
the
North
very
great
said
the
scout
that
flies
counts
every
foeman
twice
yet
have
spoken
stouthearted
men
and
not
doubt
that
the
main
strength
the
enemy
many
times
great
all
that
have
here
Then
let
swift
said
Eomer
Let
drive
through
such
foes
are
already
between
and
the
fastness
There
are
caves
Helm
Deep
where
hundreds
may
lie
hid
and
secret
ways
lead
thence
the
hills
Trust
not
secret
ways
said
the
king
Saruman
has
long
spied
out
this
land
Still
that
place
our
defence
may
last
long
Let
Aragorn
and
Legolas
went
now
with
Eomer
the
van
through
the
dark
night
they
rode
ever
slower
the
darkness
deepened
and
530
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
their
way
climbed
southward
higher
and
higher
into
the
dim
folds
about
the
mountains
feet
They
found
few
the
enemy
before
them
Here
and
there
they
came
upon
roving
bands
Orcs
but
they
fled
ere
the
Riders
could
take
slay
them
will
not
long
fear
said
Eomer
ere
the
coming
the
king
host
will
known
the
leader
our
enemies
Saruman
whatever
captain
has
sent
forth
The
rumour
war
grew
behind
them
Now
they
could
hear
borne
over
the
dark
the
sound
harsh
singing
They
had
climbed
far
into
the
Deeping
coomb
when
they
looked
back
Then
they
saw
torches
countless
points
fiery
light
upon
the
black
fields
behind
scattered
like
red
flowers
winding
from
the
lowlands
long
flickering
lines
Here
and
there
larger
blaze
leapt
great
host
and
follows
hard
said
Aragorn
They
bring
fire
said
Théoden
and
they
are
burning
they
come
rick
cot
and
tree
This
was
rich
vale
and
had
many
home
steads
Alas
for
folk
Would
that
day
was
here
and
might
ride
down
upon
them
like
storm
out
the
mountains
said
Aragorn
grieves
fly
before
them
need
not
fly
much
further
said
Eomer
Not
far
ahead
now
lies
Helm
Dike
ancient
trench
and
rampart
scored
across
the
coomb
two
furlongs
below
Helm
Gate
There
can
turn
and
give
battle
Nay
are
too
few
defend
the
Dike
said
Théoden
mile
long
more
and
the
breach
wide
the
breach
our
rearguard
must
stand
are
pressed
said
Eomer
There
was
neither
star
nor
moon
when
the
Riders
came
the
breach
the
Dike
where
the
stream
from
above
passed
out
and
the
road
beside
ran
down
from
the
Hornburg
The
rampart
loomed
suddenly
before
them
high
shadow
beyond
dark
pit
they
rode
sentinel
challenged
them
The
Lord
the
Mark
rides
Helm
Gate
Eomer
answered
Eomer
son
Eomund
speak
This
good
tidings
beyond
hope
said
the
sentinel
Hasten
The
enemy
your
heels
The
host
passed
through
the
breach
and
halted
the
sloping
sward
above
They
now
learned
their
joy
that
Erkenbrand
had
left
many
men
hold
Helm
Gate
and
more
had
since
escaped
thither
Maybe
have
thousand
fit
fight
foot
said
Gamling
old
man
the
leader
those
that
watched
the
Dike
But
most
them
have
seen
too
many
winters
have
too
few

What
news
Erkenbrand
Word
came
yesterday
that
was
retreating
hither
with
all
that
left
the
best
Riders
Westfold
But
has
not
come
fear
that
will
not
come
now
said
Eomer
Our
scouts
have
gained
news
him
and
the
enemy
fills
all
the
valley
behind
would
that
had
escaped
said
Théoden
was
mighty
man
him
lived
again
the
valour
Helm
the
Hammerhand
But
cannot
await
him
here
must
draw
all
our
forces
now
behind
the
walls
Are
you
well
stored
bring
little
provision
for
rode
forth
open
battle
not
siege
Behind
the
caves
the
Deep
are
three
parts
the
folk
Westfold
old
and
young
children
and
women
said
Gamling
But
great
store
food
and
many
beasts
and
their
fodder
have
also
been
gathered
there
That
well
said
Eomer
They
are
burning
despoiling
all
that
left
the
vale
they
come
bargain
for
our
goods
Helm
Gate
they
will
pay
high
price
said
Gamling
The
king
and
his
Riders
passed
Before
the
causeway
that
crossed
the
stream
they
dismounted
long
file
they
led
their
horses
the
ramp
and
passed
within
the
gates
the
Hornburg
There
they
were
welcomed
again
with
joy
and
renewed
hope
for
now
there
were
men
enough
man
both
the
burg
and
the
barrier
wall
Quickly
Eomer
set
his
men
readiness
The
king
and
the
men
his
household
were
the
Hornburg
and
there
also
were
many
the
Westfold
men
But
the
Deeping
Wall
and
its
tower
and
behind
Eomer
arrayed
most
the
strength
that
had
for
here
the
defence
seemed
more
doubtful
the
assault
were
determined
and
great
force
The
horses
were
led
far
the
Deep
under
such
guard
could
spared
The
Deeping
Wall
was
twenty
feet
high
and
thick
that
four
men
could
walk
abreast
along
the
top
sheltered
parapet
over
which
only
tall
man
could
look
Here
and
there
were
clefts
the
stone
through
which
men
could
shoot
This
battlement
could
reached
stair
running
down
from
door
the
outer
court
the
Hornburg
three
flights
steps
led
also
the
wall
from
the
Deep
behind
but
front
was
smooth
and
the
great
stones
were
set
with
such
skill
that
foothold
could
found
their
joints
and
the
top
they
hung
over
like
sea
delved
cliff
Gimli
stood
leaning
against
the
breastwork
upon
the
wall
Legolas
sat
above
the
parapet
fingering
his
bow
and
peering
out
into
the
gloom

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
This
more
liking
said
the
dwarf
stamping
the
stones
Ever
heart
rises
draw
near
the
mountains
There
good
rock
here
This
country
has
tough
bones
felt
them
feet
came
from
the
dike
Give
year
and
hundred
kin
and
would
make
this
place
that
armies
would
break
upon
like
water
not
doubt
said
Legolas
But
you
are
dwarf
and
dwarves
are
strange
folk
not
like
this
place
and
shall
like
more
the
light
day
But
you
comfort
Gimli
and
glad
have
you
standing
nigh
with
your
stout
legs
and
your
hard
axe
wish
there
were
more
your
kin
among
But
even
more
would
give
for
hundred
good
archers
Mirkwood
shall
need
them
The
Rohirrim
have
good
bowmen
after
their
fashion
but
there
are
too
few
here
too
few
dark
for
archery
said
Gimli
Indeed
time
for
sleep
Sleep
feel
the
need
never
thought
any
dwarf
could
Riding
tiring
work
Yet
axe
restless
hand
Give
row
orc
necks
and
room
swing
and
all
weariness
will
fall
from
slow
time
passed
Far
down
the
valley
scattered
fires
still
burned
The
hosts
Isengard
were
advancing
silence
now
Their
torches
could
seen
winding
the
coomb
many
lines
Suddenly
from
the
Dike
yells
and
screams
and
the
fierce
battle
cries
men
broke
out
Flaming
brands
appeared
over
the
brink
and
clustered
thickly
the
breach
Then
they
scattered
and
vanished
Men
came
galloping
back
over
the
field
and
the
ramp
the
gate
the
Hornburg
The
rearguard
the
Westfolders
had
been
driven
The
enemy
hand
they
said
loosed
every
arrow
that
had
and
filled
the
Dike
with
Orcs
But
will
not
halt
them
long
Already
they
are
scaling
the
bank
many
points
thick
marching
ants
But
have
taught
them
not
carry
torches
was
now
past
midnight
The
sky
was
utterly
dark
and
the
stillness
the
heavy
air
foreboded
storm
Suddenly
the
clouds
were
seared
blinding
flash
Branched
lightning
smote
down
upon
the
eastward
hills
For
staring
moment
the
watchers
the
walls
saw
all
the
space
between
them
and
the
Dike
lit
with
white
light
was
boiling
and
crawling
with
black
shapes
some
squat
and
broad
some
tall
and
grim
with
high
helms
and
sable
shields
Hundreds
and
hun
dreds
more
were
pouring
over
the
Dike
and
through
the
breach
The
dark
tide
flowed
the
walls
from
cliff
cliff
Thunder
rolled
the
valley
Rain
came
lashing
down
Arrows
thick
the
rain
came
whistling
over
the
battlements
and
HELM
DEEP
533
fell
clinking
and
glancing
the
stones
Some
found
mark
The
assault
Helm
Deep
had
begun
but
sound
challenge
was
heard
within
answering
arrows
came
The
assailing
hosts
halted
foiled
the
silent
menace
rock
and
wall
Ever
and
again
the
lightning
tore
aside
the
darkness
Then
the
Orcs
screamed
waving
spear
and
sword
and
shooting
cloud
arrows
any
that
stood
revealed
upon
the
battlements
and
the
men
the
Mark
amazed
looked
out
seemed
them
upon
great
field
dark
corn
tossed
tempest
war
and
every
ear
glinted
with
barbed
light
Brazen
trumpets
sounded
The
enemy
surged
forward
some
against
the
Deeping
Wall
others
towards
the
causeway
and
the
ramp
that
led
the
Hornburg
gates
There
the
hugest
Orcs
were
mustered
and
the
wild
men
the
Dunland
fells
moment
they
hesitated
and
then
they
came
The
lightning
flashed
and
blazoned
upon
every
helm
and
shield
the
ghastly
hand
Isengard
was
seen
They
reached
the
summit
the
rock
they
drove
towards
the
gates
Then
last
answer
came
storm
arrows
met
them
and
hail
stones
They
wavered
broke
and
fled
back
and
then
charged
again
broke
and
charged
again
and
each
time
like
the
incoming
sea
they
halted
higher
point
Again
trumpets
rang
and
press
roaring
men
leaped
forth
They
held
their
great
shields
above
them
like
roof
while
their
midst
they
bore
two
trunks
mighty
trees
Behind
them
orc
archers
crowded
sending
hail
darts
against
the
bowmen
the
walls
They
gained
the
gates
The
trees
swung
strong
arms
smote
the
timbers
with
rending
boom
any
man
fell
crushed
stone
hurtling
from
above
two
others
sprang
take
his
place
Again
and
again
the
great
rams
swung
and
crashed
Eomer
and
Aragorn
stood
together
the
Deeping
Wall
They
heard
the
roar
voices
and
the
thudding
the
rams
and
then
sudden
flash
light
they
beheld
the
peril
the
gates
Come
said
Aragorn
This
the
hour
when
draw
swords
together
Running
like
fire
they
sped
along
the
wall
and
the
steps
and
passed
into
the
outer
court
upon
the
Rock
they
ran
they
gathered
handful
stout
swordsmen
There
was
small
postern
door
that
opened
angle
the
burg
wall
the
west
where
the
cliff
stretched
out
meet
that
side
narrow
path
ran
round
towards
the
great
gate
between
the
wall
and
the
sheer
brink
the
Rock
Together
Eomer
and
Aragorn
sprang
through
the
door
their
men
close
behind
The
two
swords
flashed
from
the
sheath
one
Guthwiné
cried
Eomer
Guthwiné
for
the
Mark
Anduril
cried
Aragorn
Anduril
for
the
Dunedain
534
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Charging
from
the
side
they
hurled
themselves
upon
the
wild
men
Anduril
rose
and
fell
gleaming
with
white
fire
shout
went
from
wall
and
tower
Anduril
Anduril
goes
war
The
Blade
that
was
Broken
shines
again
Dismayed
the
rammers
let
fall
the
trees
and
turned
fight
but
the
wall
their
shields
was
broken
lightning
stroke
and
they
were
swept
away
hewn
down
cast
over
the
Rock
into
the
stony
stream
below
The
orc
archers
shot
wildly
and
then
fled
For
moment
Eomer
and
Aragorn
halted
before
the
gates
The
thunder
was
rumbling
the
distance
now
The
lightning
flickered
still
far
off
among
the
mountains
the
South
keen
wind
was
blowing
from
the
North
again
The
clouds
were
torn
and
drifting
and
stars
peeped
out
and
above
the
hills
the
Coomb
side
the
westering
moon
rode
glimmering
yellow
the
storm
wrack
did
not
come
too
soon
said
Aragorn
looking
the
gates
Their
great
hinges
and
iron
bars
were
wrenched
and
bent
many
their
timbers
were
cracked
The
doors
will
not
withstand
another
such
battering
Yet
cannot
stay
here
beyond
the
walls
defend
them
said
Eomer
Look
pointed
the
causeway
Already
great
press
Orcs
and
Men
were
gathering
again
beyond
the
stream
Arrows
whined
and
skipped
the
stones
about
them
Come
must
get
back
and
see
what
can
pile
stone
and
beam
across
the
gates
within
Come
now
They
turned
and
ran
that
moment
some
dozen
Orcs
that
had
lain
motionless
among
the
slain
leaped
their
feet
and
came
silently
and
swiftly
behind
Two
flung
themselves
the
ground
Eomer
heels
tripped
him
and
moment
they
were
top
him
But
small
dark
figure
that
none
had
observed
sprang
out
the
shadows
and
gave
hoarse
shout
Baruk
Khazdd
Khazdd
ménu
axe
swung
and
swept
back
Two
Orcs
fell
headless
The
rest
fled
Eomer
struggled
his
feet
even
Aragorn
ran
back
his
aid
The
postern
was
closed
again
the
iron
door
was
barred
and
piled
inside
with
stones
When
all
were
safe
within
Eomer
turned
thank
you
Gimli
son
Gloin
said
did
not
know
that
you
were
with
the
sortie
But
oft
the
unbidden
guest
proves
the
best
company
How
came
you
there
followed
you
shake
off
sleep
said
Gimli
but
looked
the
hillmen
and
they
seemed
over
large
for
sat
beside
stone
see
your
sword
play
shall
not
find
easy
repay
you
said
Eomer
There
may
many
chance
ere
the
night
over
laughed
the
HELM
DEEP
535
Dwarf
But
content
Till
now
have
hewn
naught
but
wood
since
left
Moria
Two
said
Gimli
patting
his
axe
had
returned
his
place
the
wall
Two
said
Legolas
have
done
better
though
now
must
grope
for
spent
arrows
all
mine
are
gone
Yet
make
tale
twenty
the
least
But
that
only
few
leaves
forest
The
sky
now
was
quickly
clearing
and
the
sinking
moon
was
shin
ing
brightly
But
the
light
brought
little
hope
the
Riders
the
Mark
The
enemy
before
them
seemed
have
grown
rather
than
diminished
and
still
more
were
pressing
from
the
valley
through
the
breach
The
sortie
upon
the
Rock
gained
only
brief
respite
The
assault
the
gates
was
redoubled
Against
the
Deeping
Wall
the
hosts
Isengard
roared
like
sea
Orcs
and
hillmen
swarmed
about
its
feet
from
end
end
Ropes
with
grappling
hooks
were
hurled
over
the
parapet
faster
than
men
could
cut
them
fling
them
back
Hundreds
long
ladders
were
lifted
Many
were
cast
down
ruin
but
many
more
replaced
them
and
Orcs
sprang
them
like
apes
the
dark
forests
the
South
Before
the
wall
foot
the
dead
and
broken
were
piled
like
shingle
storm
ever
higher
rose
the
hideous
mounds
and
still
the
enemy
came
The
men
Rohan
grew
weary
All
their
arrows
were
spent
and
every
shaft
was
shot
their
swords
were
notched
and
their
shields
were
riven
Three
times
Aragorn
and
Eomer
rallied
them
and
three
times
Anduril
flamed
desperate
charge
that
drove
the
enemy
from
the
wall
Then
clamour
arose
the
Deep
behind
Orcs
had
crept
like
rats
through
the
culvert
through
which
the
stream
flowed
out
There
they
had
gathered
the
shadow
the
cliffs
until
the
assault
above
was
hottest
and
nearly
all
the
men
the
defence
had
rushed
the
wall
top
Then
they
sprang
out
Already
some
had
passed
into
the
jaws
the
Deep
and
were
among
the
horses
fighting
with
the
guards
Down
from
the
wall
leapt
Gimli
with
fierce
cry
that
echoed
the
cliffs
Khazad
Khazad
soon
had
work
enough
shouted
The
Orcs
are
behind
the
wall
Come
Legolas
There
are
enough
for
both
Khazdd
ménu
Gamling
the
Old
looked
down
from
the
Hornburg
hearing
the
great
voice
the
dwarf
above
all
the
tumult
The
Orcs
are
the
Deep
cried
Helm
Helm
Forth
Helmingas
shouted
leaped
down
the
stair
from
the
Rock
with
many
men
Westfold
his
back
Their
onset
was
fierce
and
sudden
and
the
Orcs
gave
way
before
536
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
them
Ere
long
they
were
hemmed
the
narrows
the
gorge
and
all
were
slain
driven
shrieking
into
the
chasm
the
Deep
fall
before
the
guardians
the
hidden
caves
Twenty
one
cried
Gimli
hewed
two
handed
stroke
and
laid
the
last
Orc
before
his
feet
Now
count
passes
Master
Legolas
again
must
stop
this
rat
hole
said
Gamling
Dwarves
are
said
cunning
folk
with
stone
Lend
your
aid
master
not
shape
stone
with
battle
axes
nor
with
our
finger
nails
said
Gimli
But
will
help
may
They
gathered
such
small
boulders
and
broken
stones
they
could
find
hand
and
under
Gimli
direction
the
Westfold
men
blocked
the
inner
end
the
culvert
until
only
narrow
outlet
remained
Then
the
Deeping
stream
swollen
the
rain
churned
and
fretted
its
choked
path
and
spread
slowly
cold
pools
from
cliff
cliff
will
drier
above
said
Gimli
Come
Gamling
let
see
how
things
the
wall
climbed
and
found
Legolas
beside
Aragorn
and
Eomer
The
elf
was
whetting
his
long
knife
There
was
for
while
lull
the
assault
since
the
attempt
break
through
the
culvert
had
been
foiled
Twenty
one
said
Gimli
Good
said
Legolas
But
count
now
two
dozen
has
been
knife
work
here
Eomer
and
Aragorn
leant
wearily
their
swords
Away
the
left
the
crash
and
clamour
the
battle
the
Rock
rose
loud
again
But
the
Hornburg
still
held
fast
like
island
the
sea
Its
gates
lay
ruin
but
over
the
barricade
beams
and
stones
within
enemy
yet
had
passed
Aragorn
looked
the
pale
stars
and
the
moon
now
sloping
behind
the
western
hills
that
enclosed
the
valley
This
night
long
years
said
How
long
will
the
day
tarry
Dawn
not
far
off
said
Gamling
who
had
now
climbed
beside
him
But
dawn
will
not
help
fear
Yet
dawn
ever
the
hope
men
said
Aragorn
But
these
creatures
Isengard
these
half
orcs
and
goblin
men
that
the
foul
craft
Saruman
has
bred
they
will
not
quail
the
sun
said
Gamling
And
neither
will
the
wild
men
the
hills
you
not
hear
their
voices
hear
them
said
Eomer
but
they
are
only
the
scream
birds
and
the
bellowing
beasts
ears
Yet
there
are
many
that
cry
the
Dunland
tongue
said
Gamling
HELM
DEEP
537
know
that
tongue
ancient
speech
men
and
once
was
spoken
many
western
valleys
the
Mark
Hark
They
hate
and
they
are
glad
for
our
doom
seems
certain
them
The
king
the
king
they
cry
will
take
their
king
Death
the
Forgoil
Death
the
Strawheads
Death
the
robbers
the
North
Such
names
they
have
for
Not
half
thousand
years
have
they
forgotten
their
grievance
that
the
lords
Gondor
gave
the
Mark
Eorl
the
Young
and
made
alliance
with
him
That
old
hatred
Saruman
has
inflamed
They
are
fierce
folk
when
roused
They
will
not
give
way
now
for
dusk
dawn
until
Théoden
taken
they
themselves
are
slain
Nonetheless
day
will
bring
hope
said
Aragorn
not
said
that
foe
has
ever
taken
the
Hornburg
men
defended
the
minstrels
say
said
Eomer
Then
let
defend
and
hope
said
Aragorn
Even
they
spoke
there
came
blare
trumpets
Then
there
was
crash
and
flash
flame
and
smoke
The
waters
the
Deeping
stream
poured
out
hissing
and
foaming
they
were
choked
longer
gaping
hole
was
blasted
the
wall
host
dark
shapes
poured
Devilry
Saruman
cried
Aragorn
They
have
crept
the
cul
vert
again
while
talked
and
they
have
lit
the
fire
Orthanc
beneath
our
feet
Elendil
Elendil
shouted
leaped
down
into
the
breach
but
even
did
hundred
ladders
were
raised
against
the
battlements
Over
the
wall
and
under
the
wall
the
last
assault
came
sweeping
like
dark
wave
upon
hill
sand
The
defence
was
swept
away
Some
the
Riders
were
driven
back
further
and
further
into
the
Deep
falling
and
fighting
they
gave
way
step
step
towards
the
caves
Others
cut
their
way
back
towards
the
citadel
broad
stairway
climbed
from
the
Deep
the
Rock
and
the
rear
gate
the
Hornburg
Near
the
bottom
stood
Aragorn
his
hand
still
Anduril
gleamed
and
the
terror
the
sword
for
while
held
back
the
enemy
one
one
all
who
could
gain
the
stair
passed
towards
the
gate
Behind
the
upper
steps
knelt
Legolas
His
bow
was
bent
but
one
gleaned
arrow
was
all
that
had
left
and
peered
out
now
ready
shoot
the
first
Orc
that
should
dare
approach
the
stair
All
who
can
have
now
got
safe
within
Aragorn
called
Come
back
Aragorn
turned
and
sped
the
stair
but
ran
stumbled
his
weariness
once
his
enemies
leapt
forward
came
the
Orcs
yelling
with
their
long
arms
stretched
out
seize
him
The
538
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
foremost
fell
with
Legolas
last
arrow
his
throat
but
the
rest
sprang
over
him
Then
great
boulder
cast
from
the
outer
wall
above
crashed
down
upon
the
stair
and
hurled
them
back
into
the
Deep
Aragorn
gained
the
door
and
swiftly
clanged
behind
him
Things
ill
friends
said
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
brow
with
his
arm
Ill
enough
said
Legolas
but
not
yet
hopeless
while
have
you
with
Where
Gimli
not
know
said
Aragorn
last
saw
him
fighting
the
ground
behind
the
wall
but
the
enemy
swept
apart
Alas
That
evil
news
said
Legolas
stout
and
strong
said
Aragorn
Let
hope
that
will
escape
back
the
caves
There
would
safe
for
while
Safer
than
Such
refuge
would
the
liking
dwarf
That
must
hope
said
Legolas
But
wish
that
had
come
this
way
desired
tell
Master
Gimli
that
tale
now
thirty
nine
wins
back
the
caves
will
pass
your
count
again
laughed
Aragorn
Never
did
see
axe
wielded
must
and
seek
some
arrows
said
Legolas
Would
that
this
night
would
end
and
could
have
better
light
for
shooting
Aragorn
now
passed
into
the
citadel
There
his
dismay
learned
that
Eomer
had
not
reached
the
Hornburg
Nay
did
not
come
the
Rock
said
one
the
Westfold
men
last
saw
him
gathering
men
about
him
and
fighting
the
mouth
the
Deep
Gamling
was
with
him
and
the
dwarf
but
could
not
come
them
Aragorn
strode
through
the
inner
court
and
mounted
high
chamber
the
tower
There
stood
the
king
dark
against
narrow
window
looking
out
upon
the
vale
What
the
news
Aragorn
said
The
Deeping
Wall
taken
lord
and
all
the
defence
swept
away
but
many
have
escaped
hither
the
Rock
Eomer
here
lord
But
many
your
men
retreated
into
the
Deep
and
some
say
that
Eomer
was
amongst
them
the
narrows
they
may
hold
back
the
enemy
and
come
within
the
caves
What
hope
they
may
have
then
not
know
More
than
Good
provision
said
And
the
air
wholesome
there
because
the
outlets
through
fissures
the
rock
far
above
None
can
force
entrance
against
determined
men
They
may
hold
out
long
But
the
Orcs
have
brought
devilry
from
Orthanc
said
Aragorn
HELM
DEEP
539
They
have
blasting
fire
and
with
they
took
the
Wall
they
cannot
come
the
caves
they
may
seal
those
that
are
inside
But
now
must
turn
all
our
thought
our
own
defence
fret
this
prison
said
Théoden
could
have
set
spear
rest
riding
before
men
upon
the
field
maybe
could
have
felt
again
the
joy
battle
and
ended
But
serve
little
purpose
here
Here
least
you
are
guarded
the
strongest
fastness
the
Mark
said
Aragorn
More
hope
have
defend
you
the
Hornburg
than
Edoras
even
Dunharrow
the
mountains
said
that
the
Hornburg
has
never
fallen
assault
said
Theoden
but
now
heart
doubtful
The
world
changes
and
all
that
once
was
strong
now
proves
unsure
How
shall
any
tower
withstand
such
numbers
and
such
reckless
hate
Had
known
that
the
strength
Isengard
was
grown
great
maybe
should
not
rashly
have
ridden
forth
meet
for
all
the
arts
Gandalf
His
counsel
seems
not
now
good
did
under
the
morning
sun
not
judge
the
counsel
Gandalf
until
all
over
lord
said
Aragorn
The
end
will
not
long
said
the
king
But
will
not
end
here
taken
like
old
badger
trap
Snowmane
and
Hasufel
and
the
horses
guard
are
the
inner
court
When
dawn
comes
will
bid
men
sound
Helm
horn
and
will
ride
forth
Will
you
ride
with
then
son
Arathorn
Maybe
shall
cleave
road
make
such
end
will
worth
song
any
left
sing
hereafter
will
ride
with
you
said
Aragorn
Taking
his
leave
returned
the
walls
and
passed
round
all
their
circuit
enheartening
the
men
and
lending
aid
wherever
the
assault
was
hot
Legolas
went
with
him
Blasts
fire
leaped
from
below
shaking
the
stones
Grappling
hooks
were
hurled
and
ladders
raised
Again
and
again
the
Orcs
gained
the
summit
the
outer
wall
and
again
the
defenders
cast
them
down
last
Aragorn
stood
above
the
great
gates
heedless
the
darts
the
enemy
looked
forth
saw
the
eastern
sky
grow
pale
Then
raised
his
empty
hand
palm
outward
token
parley
The
Orcs
yelled
and
jeered
Come
down
Come
down
they
cried
you
wish
speak
come
down
Bring
out
your
king
are
the
fighting
Uruk

will
fetch
him
from
his
hole
does
not
come
Bring
out
your
skulking
king
The
king
stays
comes
his
own
will
said
Aragorn
Then
what
are
you
doing
here
they
answered
Why
you
look
out
you
wish
see
the
greatness
our
army
are
the

THE

Aragorn

Aragorn
Get

Get

spared
Not
one
will
left
alive
take
back
tidings
the
North
You
not
know
your
peril
great
power
and
royalty
was
revealed
Aragorn
stood
there
alone
above
the
ruined
gates
before
the
host
his
enemies
that
many
the
wild
men
paused
and
looked
back
over
their
shoulders
the
valley
and
some
looked
doubtfully
the
sky
But
the
Orcs
laughed
with
loud
voices
and
hail
darts
and
arrows
whistled
over
the
wall
Aragorn
leaped
down
There
was
roar
and
blast
fire
The
archway
the
gate
above
which
had
stood
moment
before
crumbled
and
crashed
smoke
and
dust
The
barricade
was
scattered
thunderbolt
Aragorn
ran
the
king
tower
But
even
the
gate
fell
and
the
Orcs
about
yelled
preparing
charge
murmur
arose
behind
them
like
wind
the
distance
and
grew
clamour
many
voices
crying
strange
news
the
dawn
The
Orcs
upon
the
Rock
hearing
the
rumour
dismay
wavered
and
looked
back
And
then
sudden
and
terrible
from
the
tower
above
the
sound
the
great
horn
Helm
rang
out
All
that
heard
that
sound
trembled
Many
the
Orcs
cast
them
selves
their
faces
and
covered
their
ears
with
their
claws
Back
from
the
Deep
the
echoes
came
blast
upon
blast
every
cliff
and
hill
mighty
herald
stood
But
the
walls
men
looked
listening
with
wonder
for
the
echoes
did
not
die
Ever
the
hornblasts
wound
among
the
hills
nearer
now
and
louder
they
answered
one
another
blowing
fierce
and
free
Helm
Helm
the
Riders
shouted
Helm
arisen
and
comes
back
war
Helm
for
Theoden
King
And
with
that
shout
the
king
came
His
horse
was
white
snow
golden
was
his
shield
and
his
spear
was
long
his
right
hand
was
Aragorn
Elendil
heir
behind
him
rode
the
lords
the
House
Eorl
the
Young
Light
sprang
the
sky
Night
departed
Forth
Eorlingas
With
cry
and
great
noise
they
charged
Down
from
the
gates
they
roared
over
the
causeway
they
swept
and
they
HELM
DEEP
541
drove
through
the
hosts
Isengard
wind
among
grass
Behind
them
from
the
Deep
came
the
stern
cries
men
issuing
from
the
caves
driving
forth
the
enemy
Out
poured
all
the
men
that
were
left
upon
the
Rock
And
ever
the
sound
blowing
horns
echoed
the
hills
they
rode
the
king
and
his
companions
Captains
and
cham
pions
fell
fled
before
them
Neither
orc
nor
man
withstood
them
Their
backs
were
the
swords
and
spears
the
Riders
and
their
faces
the
valley
They
cried
and
wailed
for
fear
and
great
wonder
had
come
upon
them
with
the
rising
the
day
King
Théoden
rode
from
Helm
Gate
and
clove
his
path
the
great
Dike
There
the
company
halted
Light
grew
bright
about
them
Shafts
the
sun
flared
above
the
eastern
hills
and
glimmered
their
spears
But
they
sat
silent
their
horses
and
they
gazed
down
upon
the
Deeping
coomb
The
land
had
changed
Where
before
the
green
dale
had
lain
its
grassy
slopes
lapping
the
ever
mounting
hills
there
now
forest
loomed
Great
trees
bare
and
silent
stood
rank
rank
with
tangled
bough
and
hoary
head
their
twisted
roots
were
buried
the
long
green
grass
Darkness
was
under
them
Between
the
Dike
and
the
eaves
that
nameless
wood
only
two
open
furlongs
lay
There
now
cowered
the
proud
hosts
Saruman
terror
the
king
and
terror
the
trees
They
streamed
down
from
Helm
Gate
until
all
above
the
Dike
was
empty
them
but
below
they
were
packed
like
swarming
flies
Vainly
they
crawled
and
clambered
about
the
walls
the
coomb
seeking
escape
Upon
the
east
too
sheer
and
stony
was
the
valley
side
upon
the
left
from
the
west
their
final
doom
approached
There
suddenly
upon
ridge
appeared
rider
clad
white
shining
the
rising
sun
Over
the
low
hills
the
horns
were
sounding
Behind
him
hastening
down
the
long
slopes
were
thousand
men
foot
their
swords
were
their
hands
Amid
them
strode
man
tall
and
strong
His
shield
was
red
came
the
valley
brink
set
his
lips
great
black
horn
and
blew
ringing
blast
Erkenbrand
the
Riders
shouted
Erkenbrand
Behold
the
White
Rider
cried
Aragorn
Gandalf
come
again
Mithrandir
Mithrandir
said
Legolas
This
wizardry
indeed
Come
would
look
this
forest
ere
the
spell
changes
The
hosts
Isengard
roared
swaying
this
way
and
that
turning
from
fear
fear
Again
the
horn
sounded
from
the
tower
Down
through
the
breach
the
Dike
charged
the
king
company
Down
from
the
hills
leaped
Erkenbrand
lord
Westfold
Down
leaped
542
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Shadowfax
like
deer
that
runs
surefooted
the
mountains
The
White
Rider
was
upon
them
and
the
terror
his
coming
filled
the
enemy
with
madness
The
wild
men
fell
their
faces
before
him
The
Orcs
reeled
and
screamed
and
cast
aside
both
sword
and
spear
Like
black
smoke
driven
mounting
wind
they
fled
Wailing
they
passed
under
the
waiting
shadow
the
trees
and
from
that
shadow
none
ever
came
again
Chapter
THE
ROAD
ISENGARD
was
that
the
light
fair
morning
King
Théoden
and
Gandalf
the
White
Rider
met
again
upon
the
green
grass
beside
the
Deeping
stream
There
was
also
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
and
Legolas
the
Elf
and
Erkenbrand
Westfold
and
the
lords
the
Golden
House
About
them
were
gathered
the
Rohirrim
the
Riders
the
Mark
wonder
overcame
their
joy
victory
and
their
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
wood
Suddenly
there
was
great
shout
and
down
from
the
Dike
came
those
who
had
been
driven
back
into
the
Deep
There
came
Gamling
the
Old
and
Eomer
son
Eomund
and
beside
them
walked
Gimli
the
dwarf
had
helm
and
about
his
head
was
linen
band
stained
with
blood
but
his
voice
was
loud
and
strong
Forty
two
Master
Legolas
cried
Alas
axe
notched
the
forty
second
had
iron
collar
his
neck
How
with
you
You
have
passed
score
one
answered
Legolas
But
not
grudge
you
the
game
glad
see
you
your
legs
Welcome
Eomer
sister
son
said
Théoden
Now
that
see
you
safe
glad
indeed
Hail
Lord
the
Mark
said
Eomer
The
dark
night
has
passed
and
day
has
come
again
But
the
day
has
brought
strange
tidings
turned
and
gazed
wonder
first
the
wood
and
then
Gandalf
Once
more
you
come
the
hour
need
unlooked
for
said
Unlooked
for
said
Gandalf
said
that
would
return
and
meet
you
here
But
you
did
not
name
the
hour
nor
foretell
the
manner
your
coming
Strange
help
you
bring
You
are
mighty
wizardry
Gandalf
the
White
That
may
But
have
not
shown
yet
have
but
given
good
counsel
peril
and
made
use
the
speed
Shadowfax
Your
own
valour
has
done
more
and
the
stout
legs
the
Westfold
men
marching
through
the
night
Then
they
all
gazed
Gandalf
with
still
greater
wonder
Some
glanced
darkly
the
wood
and
passed
their
hands
over
their
brows
they
thought
their
eyes
saw
otherwise
than
his
Gandalf
laughed
long
and
merrily
The
trees
said
Nay
see
the
wood
plainly
you
But
that
deed
mine
thing
beyond
the
counsel
the
wise
Better
than
design
and
better
even
than
hope
the
event
has
proved
544
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Then
not
yours
whose
the
wizardry
said
Théoden
Not
Saruman
that
plain
there
some
mightier
sage
whom
have
yet
learn
not
wizardry
but
power
far
older
said
Gandalf
power
that
walked
the
earth
ere
elf
sang
hammer
rang
Ere
iron
was
found
tree
was
hewn
When
young
was
mountain
under
moon
Ere
ring
was
made
wrought
was
woe
walked
the
forests
long
ago
And
what
may
the
answer
your
riddle
said
Théoden
you
would
learn
that
you
should
come
with
Isengard
answered
Gandalf
Isengard
they
cried
Yes
said
Gandalf
shall
return
Isengard
and
those
who
will
may
come
with
There
may
see
strange
things
But
there
are
not
men
enough
the
Mark
not
they
were
all
gathered
together
and
healed
wounds
and
weariness
assault
the
stronghold
Saruman
said
Théoden
Nevertheless
Isengard
said
Gandalf
shall
not
stay
there
long
way
lies
now
eastward
Look
for
Edoras
ere
the
waning
the
moon
Nay
said
Théoden
the
dark
hour
before
dawn
doubted
but
will
not
part
now
will
come
with
you
that
your
counsel
wish
speak
with
Saruman
soon
may
now
said
Gandalf
and
since
has
done
you
great
injury
would
fitting
you
were
there
But
how
soon
and
how
swiftly
will
you
ride
men
are
weary
with
battle
said
the
King
and
weary
also
For
have
ridden
far
and
slept
little
Alas
old
age
not
feigned
nor
due
only
the
whisperings
Wormtongue
ill
that
leech
can
wholly
cure
not
even
Gandalf
Then
let
all
who
are
ride
with
rest
now
said
Gandalf
will
journey
under
the
shadow
evening
well
for
counsel
that
all
our
comings
and
goings
should
secret
may
henceforth
But
not
command
many
men
with
you
Theoden
parley
not
fight
The
King
then
chose
men
that
were
unhurt
and
had
swift
horses
and
sent
them
forth
with
tidings
the
victory
into
every
vale
the
Mark
and
they
bore
his
summons
also
bidding
all
men
young
and
old
come
haste
Edoras
There
the
Lord
the
Mark
would
hold
assembly
all
that
could
bear
arms
the
third
day
after
the
full
moon
ride
with

Isengard
the
King

Aragorn
and
Legolas
and
Gimli
spite
his
hurt
the
dwarf
would
not
stay
behind
was
only
feeble
blow
and
the
cap
turned
said
would
take
more
than
such
orc
scratch
keep
back
will
tend
while
you
rest
said
Aragorn
The
king
now
returned
the
Hornburg
and
slept
such
sleep
quiet
had
not
known
for
many
years
and
the
remainder
his
chosen
company
rested
also
But
the
others
all
that
were
not
hurt
wounded
began
great
labour
for
many
had
fallen
the
battle
and
lay
dead
upon
the
field
the
Deep
Orcs
remained
alive
their
bodies
were
uncounted
But
great
many
the
hillmen
had
given
themselves
and
they
were
afraid
and
cried
for
mercy
The
Men
the
Mark
took
their
weapons
from
them
and
set
them
work
Help
now
repair
the
evil
which
you
have
joined
said
Erken
brand
and
afterwards
you
shall
take
oath
never
again
pass
the
Fords
Isen
arms
nor
march
with
the
enemies
Men
and
then
you
shall
free
back
your
land
For
you
have
been
deluded
Saruman
Many
you
have
got
death
the
reward
your
trust
him
but
had
you
conquered
little
better
would
your
wages
have
been
The
men
Dunland
were
amazed
for
Saruman
had
told
them
that
the
men
Rohan
were
cruel
and
burned
their
captives
alive
the
midst
the
field
before
the
Hornburg
two
mounds
were
raised
and
beneath
them
were
laid
all
the
Riders
the
Mark
who
fell
the
defence
those
the
East
Dales
upon
one
side
and
those
Westfold
upon
the
other
But
the
men
Dunland
were
set
apart
mound
below
the
Dike
grave
alone
under
the
shadow
the
Hornburg
lay
Hama
captain
the
King
guard
fell
before
the
Gate
The
Orcs
were
piled
great
heaps
away
from
the
mounds
Men
not
far
from
the
eaves
the
forest
And
the
people
were
troubled
their
minds
for
the
heaps
carrion
were
too
great
for
burial
for
burning
They
had
little
wood
for
firing
and
none
would
have
dared
take
axe
the
strange
trees
even
Gandalf
had
not
warned
them
hurt
neither
bark
nor
bough
their
great
peril
Let
the
Orcs
lie
said
Gandalf
The
morning
may
bring
new
counsel
the
afternoon
the
King
company
prepared
depart
The
work
burial
was
then
but
beginning
and
Théoden
mourned
for
the
loss
Hama
his
captain
and
cast
the
first
earth
upon
his
grave
546
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Great
injury
indeed
has
Saruman
done
and
all
this
land
said
and
will
remember
when
meet
The
sun
was
already
drawing
near
the
hills
upon
the
west
the
Coomb
when
last
Théoden
and
Gandalf
and
their
companions
rode
down
from
the
Dike
Behind
them
were
gathered
great
host
both
the
Riders
and
the
people
Westfold
old
and
young
women
and
children
who
had
come
out
from
the
caves
song
victory
they
sang
with
clear
voices
and
then
they
fell
silent
wondering
what
would
chance
for
their
eyes
were
the
trees
and
they
feared
them
The
Riders
came
the
wood
and
they
halted
horse
and
man
they
were
unwilling
pass
The
trees
were
grey
and
menacing
and
shadow
mist
was
about
them
The
ends
their
long
sweeping
boughs
hung
down
like
searching
fingers
their
roots
stood
from
the
ground
like
the
limbs
strange
monsters
and
dark
caverns
opened
beneath
them
But
Gandalf
went
forward
leading
the
company
and
where
the
road
from
the
Hornburg
met
the
trees
they
saw
now
opening
like
arched
gate
under
mighty
boughs
and
through
Gandalf
passed
and
they
followed
him
Then
their
amazement
they
found
that
the
road
ran
and
the
Deeping
stream
beside
and
the
sky
was
open
above
and
full
golden
light
But
either
side
the
great
aisles
the
wood
were
already
wrapped
dusk
stretching
away
into
impenetrable
shadows
and
there
they
heard
the
creaking
and
groaning
boughs
and
far
cries
and
rumour
wordless
voices
murmuring
angrily
Orc
other
living
creature
could
seen
Legolas
and
Gimli
were
now
riding
together
upon
one
horse
and
they
kept
close
beside
Gandalf
for
Gimli
was
afraid
the
wood
hot
here
said
Legolas
Gandalf
feel
great
wrath
about
you
not
feel
the
air
throb
your
ears
Yes
said
Gandalf
What
has
become
the
miserable
Orcs
said
Legolas
That
think
one
will
ever
know
said
Gandalf
They
rode
silence
for
while
but
Legolas
was
ever
glancing
from
side
side
and
would
often
have
halted
listen
the
sounds
the
wood
Gimli
had
allowed
These
are
the
strangest
trees
that
ever
saw
said
and
have
seen
many
oak
grow
from
acorn
ruinous
age
wish
that
there
were
leisure
now
walk
among
them
they
have
voices
and
time
might
come
understand
their
thought
said
Gimli
Let
leave
them
guess
their
thought
already
hatred
all
that
two
legs
and
their
speech
crushing
and
strangling
THE
ROAD
ISENGARD
547
Not
all
that
two
legs
said
Legolas
There
think
you
are
wrong
Orcs
that
they
hate
For
they
not
belong
here
and
know
little
Elves
and
Men
Far
away
are
the
valleys
where
they
sprang
From
the
deep
dales
Fangorn
Gimli
that
whence
they
come
guess
Then
that
the
most
perilous
wood
Middle
earth
said
Gimli
should
grateful
for
the
part
they
have
played
but
not
love
them
You
may
think
them
wonderful
but
have
seen
greater
wonder
this
land
more
beautiful
than
any
grove
glade
that
ever
grew
heart
still
full
Strange
are
the
ways
Men
Legolas
Here
they
have
one
the
marvels
the
Northern
World
and
what
they
say
Caves
they
say
Caves
Holes

time
war
store
fodder
good
Legolas
you
know
that
the
caverns
Helm
Deep
are
vast
and
beautiful
There
would
endless
pilgrimage
Dwarves
merely
gaze
them
such
things
were
known
Aye
indeed
they
would
pay
pure
gold
for
brief
glance
And
would
give
gold
excused
said
Legolas
and
double
let
out
strayed
You
have
not
seen
forgive
your
jest
said
Gimli
But
you
speak
like
fool
you
think
those
halls
are
fair
where
your
King
dwells
under
the
hill
Mirkwood
and
Dwarves
helped
their
making
long
ago
They
are
but
hovels
compared
with
the
caverns
have
seen
here
immeasurable
halls
filled
with
everlasting
music
water
that
tinkles
into
pools
fair
Kheled
zaram
the
starlight
And
Legolas
when
the
torches
are
kindled
and
men
walk
the
sandy
floors
under
the
echoing
domes
then
Legolas
gems
and
crystals
and
veins
precious
ore
glint
the
polished
walls
and
the
light
glows
through
folded
marbles
shell
like
translucent
the
living
hands
Queen
Galadriel
There
are
columns
white
and
saffron
and
dawn
rose
Legolas
fluted
and
twisted
into
dreamlike
forms
they
spring
from
many
coloured
floors
meet
the
glistening
pendants
the
roof
wings
ropes
curtains
fine
frozen
clouds
spears
banners
pinnacles
suspended
palaces
Still
lakes
mirror
them
glimmering
world
looks
from
dark
pools
covered
with
clear
glass
cities
such
the

Durin
could
scarce
have
imagined
his
sleep

Then
evening

they

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
The
Caverns
Helm
Deep
Happy
was
the
chance
that
drove
there
makes
weep
leave
them
Then
will
wish
you
this
fortune
for
your
comfort
Gimli
said
the
Elf
that
you
may
come
safe
from
war
and
return
see
them
again
But
not
tell
all
your
kindred
There
seems
little
left
for
them
from
your
account
Maybe
the
men
this
land
are
wise
say
little
one
family
busy
dwarves
with
hammer
and
chisel
might
mar
more
than
they
made
you
not
understand
said
Gimli
dwarf
could
unmoved
such
loveliness
None
Durin
race
would
mine
those
caves
for
stones
ore
not
diamonds
and
gold
could
got
there
you
cut
down
groves
blossoming
trees
the
springtime
for
firewood
would
tend
these
glades
flowering
stone
not
quarry
them
With
cautious
skill
tap
tap
small
chip
rock
and
more
perhaps
whole
anxious
day
could
work
and
the
years
went
should
open
new
ways
and
display
far
chambers
that
are
still
dark
glimpsed
only
void
beyond
fissures
the
rock
And
lights
Legolas
should
make
lights
such
lamps
once
shone
Khazad
dtim
and
when
wished
would
drive
away
the
night
that
has
lain
there
since
the
hills
were
made
and
when
desired
rest
would
let
the
night
return
You
move
Gimli
said
Legolas
have
never
heard
you
speak
like
this
before
Almost
you
make
regret
that
have
not
seen
these
caves
Come
Let
make
this
bargain
both
return
safe
out
the
perils
that
await
will
journey
for
while
together
You
shall
visit
Fangorn
with
and
then
will
come
with
you
see
Helm
Deep
That
would
not
the
way
return
that
should
choose
said
Gimli
But
will
endure
Fangorn
have
your
promise
come
back
the
caves
and
share
their
wonder
with
You
have
promise
said
Legolas
But
alas
Now
must
leave
behind
both
cave
and
wood
for
while
See
are
coming
the
end
the
trees
How
far
Isengard
Gandalf
About
fifteen
leagues
the
crows
Saruman
make
said
Gandalf
five
from
the
mouth
Deeping
coomb
the
Fords
and
ten
more
from
there
the
gates
Isengard
But
shall
not
ride
all
the
way
this
night
And
when
come
there
what
shall
see
asked
Gimli
You
may
know
but
cannot
guess
not
know
myself
for
certain
answered
the
wizard
was
there
nightfall
yesterday
but
much
may
have
happened
since
Yet
think
that
you
will
not
say
that
the
journey
was
vain
not
though
the
Glittering

ISENGARD
549
last
the
company
passed
through
the
trees
and
found
that
they
had
come
the
bottom
the
Coomb
where
the
road
from
Helm
Deep
branched
going
one
way
east
Edoras
and
the
other
north
the
Fords
Isen
they
rode
from
under
the
eaves
the
wood
Legolas
halted
and
looked
back
with
regret
Then
gave
sudden
cry
There
are
eyes
said
Eyes
looking
out
from
the
shadows
the
boughs
never
saw
such
eyes
before
The
others
surprised
his
cry
halted
and
turned
but
Legolas
started
ride
back
cried
Gimli
you
please
your
madness
but
let
first
get
down
from
this
horse
wish
see
eyes
Stay
Legolas
Greenleaf
said
Gandalf
not
back
into
the
wood
not
yet
Now
not
your
time
Even
spoke
there
came
forward
out
the
trees
three
strange
shapes
tall
trolls
they
were
twelve
feet
more
height
their
strong
bodies
stout
young
trees
seemed
clad
with
raiment
with
hide
close
fitting
grey
and
brown
Their
limbs
were
long
and
their
hands
had
many
fingers
their
hair
was
stiff
and
their
beards
grey
green
moss
They
gazed
out
with
solemn
eyes
but
they
were
not
looking
the
riders
their
eyes
were
bent
northwards
Suddenly
they
lifted
their
long
hands
their
mouths
and
sent
forth
ringing
calls
clear
notes
horn
but
more
musical
and
various
The
calls
were
answered
and
turning
again
the
riders
saw
other
creatures
the
same
kind
approaching
striding
through
the
grass
They
came
swiftly
from
the
North
walking
like
wading
herons
their
gait
but
not
their
speed
for
their
legs
their
long
paces
beat
quicker
than
the
heron
wings
The
riders
cried
aloud
wonder
and
some
set
their
hands
upon
their
sword
hilts
You
need
weapons
said
Gandalf
These
are
but
herdsmen
They
are
not
enemies
indeed
they
are
not
concerned
with
all
seemed
for
spoke
the
tall
creatures
without
glance
the
riders
strode
into
the
wood
and
vanished
Herdsmen
said
Théoden
Where
are
their
flocks
What
are
they
Gandalf
For
plain
that
you
any
rate
they
are
not
strange
They
are
the
shepherds
the
trees
answered
Gandalf
long
since
you
listened
tales
the
fireside
There
are
children
your
land
who
out
the
twisted
threads
story
could
pick
the
answer
your
question
You
have
seen
Ents
King
Ents
out
Fangorn
Forest
which
your
tongue
you
call
the
Entwood
Did
you
think
that
the
name
was
given
only
idle
fancy
Nay
Theoden
otherwise
them
you
are
but
the
passing
tale
all
the
years
from
Eorl
the
Young
Theoden
the
Old
are
little
count
them
and
all
the
deeds
your
house
but
small
matter
The
king
was
silent
Ents
said
length
Out
the
shadows

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
legend
begin
little
understand
the
marvel
the
trees
think
have
lived
see
strange
days
Long
have
tended
our
beasts
and
our
fields
built
our
houses
wrought
our
tools
ridden
away
help
the
wars
Minas
Tirith
And
that
called
the
life
Men
the
way
the
world
cared
little
for
what
lay
beyond
the
borders
our
land
Songs
have
that
tell
these
things
but
are
forgetting
them
teaching
them
only
children
careless
custom
And
now
the
songs
have
come
down
among
out
strange
places
and
walk
visible
under
the
Sun
You
should
glad
Theoden
King
said
Gandalf
For
not
only
the
little
life
Men
now
endangered
but
the
life
also
those
things
which
you
have
deemed
the
matter
legend
You
are
not
without
allies
even
you
know
them
not
Yet
also
should
sad
said
Théoden
For
however
the
fortune
war
shall
may
not
end
that
much
that
was
fair
and
wonderful
shall
pass
for
ever
out
Middle
earth
may
said
Gandalf
The
evil
Sauron
cannot
wholly
cured
nor
made
had
not
been
But
such
days
are
doomed
Let
now
with
the
journey
have
begun
The
company
turned
then
away
from
the
Coomb
and
from
the
wood
and
took
the
road
towards
the
Fords
Legolas
followed
reluc
tantly
The
sun
had
set
already
had
sunk
behind
the
rim
the
world
but
they
rode
out
from
the
shadow
the
hills
and
looked
west
the
Gap
Rohan
the
sky
was
still
red
and
burning
light
was
under
the
floating
clouds
Dark
against
there
wheeled
and
flew
many
black
winged
birds
Some
passed
overhead
with
mournful
cries
returning
their
homes
among
the
rocks
The
carrion
fowl
have
been
busy
about
the
battle
field
said
Eomer
They
rode
now
easy
pace
and
dark
came
down
upon
the
plains
about
them
The
slow
moon
mounted
now
waxing
towards
the
full
and
its
cold
silver
light
the
swelling
grass
lands
rose
and
fell
like
wide
grey
sea
They
had
ridden
for
some
four
hours
from
the
branching
the
roads
when
they
drew
near
the
Fords
Long
slopes
ran
swiftly
down
where
the
river
spread
stony
shoals
between
high
grassy
terraces
Borne
upon
the
wind
they
heard
the
howling
wolves
Their
hearts
were
heavy
remembering
the
many
men
that
had
fallen
battle
this
place
The
road
dipped
between
rising
turf
banks
carving
its
way
through
the
terraces
the
river
edge
and
again
upon
the
further
side
There
were
three
lines
flat
stepping
stones
across
the
stream
and
between
them
fords
for
horses
that
went
from
either
brink
bare
eyot
the
midst
The
riders
looked
down
upon
the
crossings
THE
ROAD
ISENGARD
551
and
seemed
strange
them
for
the
Fords
had
ever
been
place
full
the
rush
and
chatter
water
upon
stones
but
now
they
were
silent
The
beds
the
stream
were
almost
dry
bare
waste
shingles
and
grey
sand
This
become
dreary
place
said
Eomer
What
sickness
has
befallen
the
river
Many
fair
things
Saruman
has
destroyed
has
devoured
the
springs
Isen
too
would
seem
said
Gandalf
Alas
said
Theoden
Must
pass
this
way
where
the
carrion
beasts
devour
many
good
Riders
the
Mark
This
our
way
said
Gandalf
Grievous
the
fall
your
men
but
you
shall
see
that
least
the
wolves
the
mountains
not
devour
them
with
their
friends
the
Orcs
that
they
hold
their
feast
such
indeed
the
friendship
their
kind
Come
They
rode
down
the
river
and
they
came
the
wolves
ceased
their
howling
and
slunk
away
Fear
fell
them
seeing
Gandalf
the
moon
and
Shadowfax
his
horse
shining
like
silver
The
riders
passed
over
the
islet
and
glittering
eyes
watched
them
wanly
from
the
shadows
the
banks
Look
said
Gandalf
Friends
have
laboured
here
And
they
saw
that
the
midst
the
eyot
mound
was
piled
ringed
with
stones
and
set
about
with
many
spears
Here
lie
all
the
Men
the
Mark
that
fell
near
this
place
said
Gandalf
Here
let
them
rest
said
Eomer
And
when
their
spears
have
rotted
and
rusted
long
still
may
their
mound
stand
and
guard
the
Fords
Isen
this
your
work
also
Gandalf
friend
said
Théoden
You
accomplished
much
evening
and
night
With
the
help
Shadowfax
and
others
said
Gandalf
rode
fast
and
far
But
here
beside
the
mound
will
say
this
for
your
comfort
many
fell
the
battles
the
Fords
but
fewer
than
rumour
made
them
More
were
scattered
than
were
slain
gathered
together
all
that
could
find
Some
men
sent
with
Grimbold
Westfold
join
Erkenbrand
Some
set
make
this
burial
They
have
now
followed
your
marshal
Elfhelm
sent
him
with
many
Riders
Edoras
Saruman
knew
had
despatched
his
full
strength
against
you
and
his
servants
had
turned
aside
from
all
other
errands
and
gone
Helm
Deep
the
lands
seemed
empty
enemies
yet
feared
that
wolf
riders
and
plunderers
might
ride
nonetheless
Meduseld
while
was
undefended
But
now
think
you
need
not
fear
you
will
find
your
house
welcome
your
return
And
glad
shall
see
again
said
Théoden
though
brief
now
doubt
not
shall
abiding
there
552
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
With
that
the
company
said
farewell
the
island
and
the
mound
and
passed
over
the
river
and
climbed
the
further
bank
Then
they
rode
glad
have
left
the
mournful
Fords
they
went
the
howling
the
wolves
broke
out
anew
There
was
ancient
highway
that
ran
down
from
Isengard
the
crossings
For
some
way
took
its
course
beside
the
river
bending
with
east
and
then
north
but
the
last
turned
away
and
went
straight
towards
the
gates
Isengard
and
these
were
under
the
mountain
side
the
west
the
valley
sixteen
miles
more
from
its
mouth
This
road
they
followed
but
they
did
not
ride
upon
for
the
ground
beside
was
firm
and
level
covered
for
many
miles
about
with
short
springing
turf
They
rode
now
more
swiftly
and
midnight
the
Fords
were
nearly
five
leagues
behind
Then
they
halted
ending
their
night
journey
for
the
King
was
weary
They
were
come
the
feet
the
Misty
Mountains
and
the
long
arms
Nan
Curunir
stretched
down
meet
them
Dark
lay
the
vale
before
them
for
the
moon
had
passed
into
the
West
and
its
light
was
hidden
the
hills
But
out
the
deep
shadow
the
dale
rose
vast
spire
smoke
and
vapour
mounted
caught
the
rays
the
sinking
moon
and
spread
shimmering
billows
black
and
silver
over
the
starry
sky
What
you
think
that
Gandalf
asked
Aragorn
One
would
say
that
all
the
Wizard
Vale
was
burning
There
ever
fume
above
that
valley
these
days
said
Eomer
but
have
never
seen
aught
like
this
before
These
are
steams
rather
than
smokes
Saruman
brewing
some
devilry
greet
Maybe
boiling
all
the
waters
Isen
and
that
why
the
river
runs
dry
Maybe
said
Gandalf
Tomorrow
shall
learn
what
doing
Now
let
rest
for
while
can
They
camped
beside
the
bed
the
Isen
river
was
still
silent
and
empty
Some
them
slept
little
But
late
the
night
the
watchmen
cried
out
and
all
awoke
The
moon
was
gone
Stars
were
shining
above
but
over
the
ground
there
crept
darkness
blacker
than
the
night
both
sides
the
river
rolled
towards
them
going
northward
Stay
where
you
are
said
Gandalf
Draw
weapons
Wait
and
will
pass
you
mist
gathered
about
them
Above
them
few
stars
still
glim
mered
faintly
but
either
side
there
arose
walls
impenetrable
gloom
they
were
narrow
lane
between
moving
towers
shadow
Voices
they
heard
whisperings
and
groanings
and
endless
rustling
sigh
the
earth
shook
under
them
Long
seemed
them
that
they
sat
and
were
afraid
but
last
the
darkness
and
the
rumour
passed
and
vanished
between
the
mountain
arms
THE
ROAD
ISENGARD
553
Away
south
upon
the
Hornburg
the
middle
night
men
heard
great
noise
wind
the
valley
and
the
ground
trembled
and
all
were
afraid
and
one
ventured
forth
But
the
morning
they
went
out
and
were
amazed
for
the
slain
Orcs
were
gone
and
the
trees
also
Far
down
into
the
valley
the
Deep
the
grass
was
crushed
and
trampled
brown
giant
herdsmen
had
pastured
great
droves
cattle
there
but
mile
below
the
Dike
huge
pit
had
been
delved
the
earth
and
over
stones
were
piled
into
hill
Men
believed
that
the
Orcs
whom
they
had
slain
were
buried
there
but
whether
those
who
had
fled
into
the
wood
were
with
them
none
could
say
for
man
ever
set
foot
upon
that
hill
The
Death
Down
was
afterwards
called
and
grass
would
grow
there
But
the
strange
trees
were
never
seen
Deeping
coomb
again
they
had
returned
night
and
had
gone
far
away
the
dark
dales
Fangorn
Thus
they
were
revenged
upon
the
Orcs
The
king
and
his
company
slept
more
that
night
but
they
saw
and
heard
other
strange
thing
save
one
the
voice
the
river
beside
them
suddenly
awoke
There
was
rush
water
hurrying
down
among
the
stones
and
when
had
passed
the
Isen
flowed
and
bubbled
its
bed
again
had
ever
done
dawn
they
made
ready
The
light
came
grey
and
pale
and
they
did
not
see
the
rising
the
sun
The
air
above
was
heavy
with
fog
and
reek
lay
the
land
about
them
They
went
slowly
riding
now
upon
the
highway
was
broad
and
hard
and
well
tended
Dimly
through
the
mists
they
could
descry
the
long
arm
the
mountains
rising
their
left
They
had
passed
into
Nan
Curunir
the
Wizard
Vale
That
was
sheltered
valley
open
only
the
South
Once
had
been
fair
and
green
and
through
the
Isen
flowed
already
deep
and
strong
before
found
the
plains
for
was
fed
many
springs
and
lesser
streams
among
the
rain
washed
hills
and
all
about
there
had
lain
pleasant
fertile
land
was
not
now
Beneath
the
walls
Isengard
there
still
were
acres
tilled
the
slaves
Saruman
but
most
the
valley
had
become
wilderness
weeds
and
thorns
Brambles
trailed
upon
the
ground
clambering
over
bush
and
bank
made
shaggy
caves
where
small
beasts
housed
trees
grew
there
but
among
the
rank
grasses
could
still
seen
the
burned
and
axe
hewn
stumps
ancient
groves
was
sad
country
silent
now
but
for
the
stony
noise
quick
waters
Smokes
and
steams
drifted
sullen
clouds
and
lurked
the
hollows
The
riders
did
not
speak
Many
doubted
their
hearts
wondering
what
dismal
end
their
journey
led
After
they
had
ridden
for
some
miles
the
highway
became
wide
street
paved
with
great
flat
stones
squared
and
laid
with
skill
554
THE
LORD
THE

blade
grass
was
seen
any

Deep
gutters
filled
with
trickling

ran
down

side
Suddenly
tall
pillar
loomed
before
them
was
black
and
set
upon
was
great
stone
carved
and
painted
the
likeness
long
White
Hand
Its
finger
pointed
north
Not
far
now
they
knew
that
the
gates
Isengard
must
stand
and
their
hearts
were
heavy
but
their
eyes
could
not
pierce
the
mists
ahead
Beneath
the
mountain
arm
within
the
Wizard
Vale
through
years
uncounted
had
stood
that
ancient
place
that
Men
called
Isen
gard
Partly
was
shaped
the
making
the
mountains
but
mighty
works
the
Men
Westernesse
had
wrought
there
old
and
Saruman
had
dwelt
there
long
and
had
not
been
idle
This
was
its
fashion
while
Saruman
was
his
height
accounted
many
the
chief
Wizards
great
ring
wall
stone
like
towering
cliffs
stood
out
from
the
shelter
the
mountain
side
from
which
ran
and
then
returned
again
One
entrance
only
was
there
made
great
arch
delved
the
southern
wall
Here
through
the
black
rock
long
tunnel
had
been
hewn
closed
either
end
with
mighty
doors
iron
They
were
wrought
and
poised
upon
their
huge
hinges
posts
steel
driven
into
the
living
stone
that
when
unbarred
they
could
moved
with
light
thrust
the
arms
noiselessly
One
who
passed
and
came
length
out
the
echoing
tunnel
beheld
plain
great
circle
somewhat
hollowed
like
vast
shallow
bowl
mile
measured
from
rim
rim
Once
had
been
green
and
filled
with
avenues
and
groves
fruitful
trees
watered
streams
that
flowed
from
the
mountains
lake
But
green
thing
grew
there
the
latter
days
Saruman
The
roads
were
paved
with
stone
flags
dark
and
hard
and
beside
their
borders
instead
trees
there
marched
long
lines
pillars
some
marble
some
copper
and
iron
joined
heavy
chains
Many
houses
there
were
chambers
halls
and
passages
cut
and
tunnelled
back
into
the
walls
upon
their
inner
side
that
all
the
open
circle
was
overlooked
countless
windows
and
dark
doors
Thousands
could
dwell
there
workers
servants
slaves
and
warriors
with
great
store
arms
wolves
were
fed
and
stabled
deep
dens
beneath
The
plain
too
was
bored
and
delved
Shafts
were
driven
deep
into
the
ground
their
upper
ends
were
covered
low
mounds
and
domes
stone
that
the
moonlight
the
Ring
Isengard
looked
like
graveyard
unquiet
dead
For
the
ground
trembled
The
shafts
ran
down
many
slopes
and
spiral
stairs
caverns
far
under
there
Saruman
had
treasuries
store
houses
armouries
smithies
and
great
furnaces
Iron
wheels
revolved
there
endlessly
and
hammers
thudded

plumes
vapour
steamed

There

who
smoothed
the
Ring
Isengard
and
yet
seemed

not
made
the

Men
but
riven
from
the
bones
the
earth
the
ancient
torment
the
hills
peak
and
isle
rock
was
black
and
gleaming
hard
four
mighty
piers
many
sided
stone
were
welded
into
one
but
near
the
summit
they
opened
into
gaping
horns
their
pinnacles
sharp
the
points
spears
keen
edged
knives
Between
them
was
narrow
space
and
there
upon
floor
polished
stone
written
with
strange
signs
man
might
stand
five
hundred
feet
above
the
plain
This
was
Orthanc
the
citadel
Saruman
the
name
which
had

twofold

for
the
Elvish
speech
orthanc
signifies

strong

was
Isengard

had
been

and
there
great
lords
had
dwelt
the
wardens
Gondor
upon
the
West
and
wise
men
that
watched
the
stars
But
Saruman
had
slowly
shaped
his
shifting
purposes
and
made
better
thought
being
deceived
for
all
those
arts
and
subtle
devices
for
which
forsook
his
former

and
which
fondly

but
from

that

its

This
was
the
stronghold
Saruman
fame
reported
for
within
living
memory
the
men
Rohan
had
not
passed
its
gates
save
perhaps
few
such
Wormtongue
who
came
secret
and
told
man
what
they
saw
Now
Gandalf
rode
the
great
pillar
the
Hand
and
passed
and
did
the
Riders
saw
their
wonder
that
the
Hand
appeared
longer
white
was
stained
with
dried
blood
and
looking
closer
they
perceived
that
its
nails
were
red
Unheeding
Gan
dalf
rode
into
the
mist
and
reluctantly
they
followed
him
All
about
them
now
there
had
been
sudden
flood
wide
pools
water
lay
beside
the
road
filling
the
hollows
and
rills
went
trickling
down
among
the
stones
last
Gandalf
halted
and
beckoned
them
and
they
came
and
saw
that
beyond
him
the
mists
had
cleared
and
pale
sunlight
shone
The
hour
noon
had
passed
They
were
come
the
doors
Isengard
But
the
doors
lay
hurled
and
twisted
the
ground
And
all
about
556
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
stone
cracked
and
splintered
into
countless
jagged
shards
was
scat
tered
far
and
wide
piled
ruinous
heaps
The
great
arch
still
stood
but
opened
now
upon
roofless
chasm
the
tunnel
was
laid
bare
and
through
the
cliff
like
walls
either
side
great
rents
and
breaches
had
been
torn
their
towers
were
beaten
into
dust
the
Great
Sea
had
risen
wrath
and
fallen
the
hills
with
storm
could
have
worked
greater
ruin
The
ring
beyond
was
filled
with
steaming
water
bubbling
caul
dron
which
there
heaved
and
floated
wreckage
beams
and
spars
chests
and
casks
and
broken
gear
Twisted
and
leaning
pillars
reared
their
splintered
stems
above
the
flood
but
all
the
roads
were
drowned
Far
off
seemed
half
veiled
winding
cloud
there
loomed
the
island
rock
Still
dark
and
tall
unbroken
the
storm
the
tower
Orthanc
stood
Pale
waters
lapped
about
its
feet
The
king
and
all
his
company
sat
silent
their
horses
marvelling
perceiving
that
the
power
Saruman
was
overthrown
but
how
they
could
not
guess
And
now
they
turned
their
eyes
towards
the
archway
and
the
ruined
gates
There
they
saw
close
beside
them
great
rubble
heap
and
suddenly
they
were
aware
two
small
figures
lying
their
ease
grey
clad
hardly
seen
among
the
stones
There
were
bottles
and
bowls
and
platters
laid
beside
them
they
had
just
eaten
well
and
now
rested
from
their
labour
One
seemed
asleep
the
other
with
crossed
legs
and
arms
behind
his
head
leaned
back
against
broken
rock
and
sent
from
his
mouth
long
wisps
and
little
rings
thin
blue
smoke
For
moment
Théoden
and
Eomer
and
all
his
men
stared
them
wonder
Amid
all
the
wreck
Isengard
this
seemed
them
the
strangest
sight
But
before
the
king
could
speak
the
small
smoke
breathing
figure
became
suddenly
aware
them
they
sat
there
silent
the
edge
the
mist
sprang
his
feet
young
man
looked
like
one
though
not
much
more
than
half
man
height
his
head
brown
curling
hair
was
uncovered
but
was
clad
travel
stained
cloak
the
same
hue
and
shape
the
com
panions
Gandalf
had
worn
when
they
rode
Edoras
bowed
very
low
putting
his
hand
upon
his
breast
Then
seeming
not
observe
the
wizard
and
his
friends
turned
Eomer
and
the
king
Welcome

Doubtless

Gandalf
And
was
Saruman
that
ordered

guard

for

when
your

could
spared

the

answered
Merry
gravely

Our

from
Treebeard
who
has
taken
over
the

Isengard
commanded
welcome

Lord
Rohan
with
fitting
words

done

And
what
about
your

What
about
Legolas
and
cried
Gimli
unable
contain
himself
longer
You

you

truants
fine

you
have
led
Two
hundred
leagues
through
fen
and

and
death
rescue
you
And
here
find
you
feasting
and
idling
and
smoking
Smoking
Where
did
you
come
the
weed
you
villains
Hammer
and
tongs
torn
between
rage
and
joy
that
not
burst
will
marvel
You
speak

Gimli
laughed
Legolas
Though
would
sooner
learn
how
they
came
the
wine
One
thing
you
have
not
found
your
hunting
and
that
brighter

said
Pippin
opening
eye
Here
you
find
sitting

amid
the

armies
and
you
wonder
how
came
few
well
earned

Well
earned
said
Gimli
cannot
believe
that
The
Riders
laughed
cannot
doubted
that
witness
the
meeting
dear

said
Theoden
these
are
the
lost
ones
your
company
Gandalf
The
days
are
fated
filled
with
marvels
Already
have
seen
many
since
left

and
now
here
before
eyes
stand
yet
another
the

legend
Are
not
these
the
Halflings
that
some
among
call
the
Holbytlan
Hobbits
you
please

said
Pippin
Hobbits
said
Theoden
Your
tongue
strangely
changed
but
the
name
sounds
not
unfitting
Hobbits
report
that
have
heard
does
justice
the
truth
Merry
bowed
and
Pippin
got
and
bowed
low
You
are
gra
cious
lord
hope
that
may
take
your
words
said
And
here
another
marvel
have
wandered
many
lands
since
left
home
and
never
till
now
have
found
people
that
knew
any
story
concerning
hobbits
people
came
out
the
North
long
ago
said
Théoden
But
will
not
deceive
you
know
tales
about
hobbits
All
that
said
among
that
far
away
over
many
hills
and
rivers
live
the
halfling
folk
that
dwell

But
there
are

said
Merry
For
one
thing
said
Théoden
had
not
heard
that
they
spouted
smoke
from

That
not
surprising
answered
Merry
for
art
which
have
not

for
more

generations
was
Tobold

Longbottom

How

Toby

You

Théoden
interrupted
Gandalf
These

will
sit

discuss

Where
Treebeard

Most

Merry
waved
his
hand
towards
the

and
they
looked
they
heard

falling
from

Far

And
Orthanc
then

Gandalf
There

Merry
But

Not

Merry

many

that
the

Gandalf
will
ride
the

they
will
find
Treebeard
there
and

may
add
that
they

Gandalf

When

For

Leaving

they
came

sat
beside

Well
well
The

over
and
meet
again
last
where
none
ever
thought
come
said
Aragorn
And
now
that
the
great
ones
have
gone
discuss
high
matters
said
Legolas
the
hunters
can
perhaps
learn
the
answers
their
own
small
riddles
tracked
you
far
the
forest
but
there
are
still
many
things
that
should
like
know
the
truth
And
there
great
deal
too
that
want
know
about
you
said
Merry
have
learnt
few
things
through
Treebeard
the
Old
Ent
but
that
not
nearly
enough
All
good
time
said
Legolas
were
the
hunters
and
you
should
give
account
yourselves
first
second
said
Gimli
would
better
after
meal
have
sore
head
and
past
mid
day
You
truants
might
make
amends
finding
some
the
plunder
that
you
spoke
Food
and
drink
would
pay
off
some
score
against
you
Then
you
shall
have
said
Pippin
Will
you
have
here
more
comfort
what

Less
than

said
Gimli
But
will
not

any
orc
house
nor
touch
Orcs
meat
anything
that
they
have
mauled
wouldn
ask
you
said
Merry
have
had
enough
Orcs

But
there
were
many
other

Isengard
Saruman
kept
enough
wisdom
not
trust
his
Orcs
had
Men
guard
his
gates
some
his
most
faithful
servants
suppose
Anyway
they
were
favoured
and
got
good
provisions
And
pipe

asked
Gimli
don
think
Merry
laughed
But
that
another
story
which
can
wait
until
after
lunch
Well

The

The

But

There

Are
you
content
Indeed
yes
said
Gimli
The
score
much
reduced
The
three
were
soon
busy
with
their
meal
and
the
two
hobbits
unabashed
set
second
time
must
keep
our
guests
company
they
said
You
are
full
courtesy
this
morning
laughed
Legolas
But
maybe
had
not
arrived
you
would
already
have
been
keeping
one
another
company
again
Maybe
and
why
not
said
Pippin
had
foul
fare
with
the
Orcs
and
little
enough
for
days
before
that
seems
long
while
since
could
eat
heart
content
does
not
seem
have
done
you
any
harm
said
Aragorn
Indeed
you
look
the
bloom
health
Aye
you
indeed
said
Gimli
looking
them
and
down
over
the
top
his
cup
Why
your
hair
twice
thick
and
curly
when
parted
and
would
swear
that
you
have
both
grown
somewhat
that
possible
for
hobbits
your
age
This
Treebeard
any
rate
has
not
starved
you
has
not
said
Merry
But
Ents
only
drink
and
drink
not
enough
for
content
Treebeard
draughts
may
nourishing
but
one
feels
the
need
something
solid
And
even
embas
none
the
worse
for
change

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
You
have
drunk
the
waters
the
Ents
have
you
said
Legolas
then
think
likely
that
Gimli
eyes
not
deceive
him
Strange
songs
have
been
sung
the
draughts
Fangorn
Many
strange
tales
have
been
told
about
that
land
said
Aragorn
have
never
entered
Come
tell
more
about
and
about
the
Ents
Ents
said
Pippin
Ents
are
well
Ents
are
all
different
for
one
thing
But
their
eyes
now
their
eyes
are
very
odd
tried
few
fumbling
words
that
trailed
off
into
silence
well
went
you
have
seen
some
distance
already
they
saw
you
any
rate
and
reported
that
you
were
the
way
and
you
will
see
many
others
expect
before
you
leave
here
You
must
form
your
own
ideas
Now
now
said
Gimli
are
beginning
the
story
the
middle
should
like
tale
the
right
order
starting
with
that
strange
day
when
our
fellowship
was
broken
You
shall
have
there
time
said
Merry
But
first
you
have
finished
eating
you
shall
fill
your
pipes
and
light
And
then
for
little
while
can
pretend
that
are
all
back
safe
Bree
again
Rivendell
produced
small
leather
bag
full
tobacco
have
heaps
said
and
you
can
all
pack
much
you
wish
when
did
some
salvage
work
this
morning
Pippin
and
There
are
lots
things
floating
about
was
Pippin
who
found
two
small
barrels
washed
out
some
cellar
store
house
suppose
When
opened
them
found
they
were
filled
with
this
fine
pipe
weed
you
could
wish
for
and
quite
unspoilt
Gimli
took
some
and
rubbed
his
palms
and
sniffed
feels
good
and
smells
good
said
good
said
Merry
dear
Gimli
Longbottom
Leaf
There
were
the
Hornblower
brandmarks
the
barrels
plain
plain
How
came
here
can
imagine
For
Saruman
private
use
fancy
never
knew
that
went
far
abroad
But
comes
handy
now
would
said
Gimli
had
pipe
with
Alas
lost
mine
Moria
before
there
pipe
all
your
plunder
afraid
not
said
Merry
have
not
found
any
not
even
here
the
guardrooms
Saruman
kept
this
dainty
himself
seems
And
don
think
would
any
use
knocking
the
doors
Orthanc
beg
pipe
him
shall
have
share
pipes
good
friends
must
pinch
Half
moment
said
Pippin
Putting
his
hand
inside
the
breast
his
jacket
pulled
out
little
soft
wallet
string

old

And
here
another
unused
one
have
carried
long
way
though
don
know
why
never
really
expected
find
any
pipe
weed
the
journey
when
own
ran
out
But
now
comes
useful
after
all
held
small
pipe
with
wide
flattened
bowl
and
handed
Gimli
Does
that
settle
the
score
between
said
Settle
cried
Gimli
Most
noble
hobbit
leaves
deep
your
debt
Well
going
back
into
the
open
air
see
what
the
wind
and
sky
are
doing
said
Legolas
will
come
with
you
said
Aragorn
They
went
out
and
seated
themselves
upon
the
piled
stones
before
the
gateway
They
could
see
far
down
into
the
valley
now
the
mists
were
lifting
and
floating
away
upon
the
breeze
Now
let
take
our
ease
here
for
little
said
Aragorn
will
sit
the
edge
ruin
and
talk
Gandalf
says
while
busy
elsewhere
feel
weariness
such
have
seldom
felt
before
wrapped
his
grey
cloak
about
him
hiding
his
mail
shirt
and
stretched
out
his
long
legs
Then
lay
back
and
sent
from
his
lips
thin
stream
smoke
Look
said
Pippin
Strider
the
Ranger
has
come
back
has
never
been
away
said
Aragorn
Strider
and
Duna
dan
too
and
belong
both
Gondor
and
the
North
They
smoked
silence
for
while
and
the
sun
shone
them
slanting
into
the
valley
from
among
white
clouds
high
the
West
Legolas
lay
still
looking
the
sun
and
sky
with
steady
eyes
and
singing
softly
himself
last
sat
Come
now
said
Time
wears
and
the
mists
are
blowing
away
would
you
strange
folk
did
not
wreathe
yourselves
smoke
What
the
tale
Well
tale
begins
with
waking
the
dark
and
finding
myself
all
strung
orc
camp
said
Pippin
Let
see
what
today
The
fifth
March
the
Shire
reckoning
said
Aragorn
Pippin
made
some
calculations
his
fingers
Only
nine
days
ago
said
seems
year
since
were
caught
Well
though
half
was
like
bad
dream
reckon
that
three
very
horrible
days
followed
Merry
will
correct
forget
anything
important
not
going
into
details
the
whips
and
the
filth
and
stench
and
all
that
does
not
bear
remembering
With
that
plunged
into
account
Boromir
last
fight
and
the
orc
march
from
Emyn
Muil
the
Forest
Every
month
the
Shire
calendar
had
days
564
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
The
others
nodded
the
various
points
were
fitted
with
their
guesses
Here
are
some
treasures
that
you
let
fall
said
Aragorn
You
will
glad
have
them
back
loosened
his
belt
from
under
his
cloak
and
took
from
the
two
sheathed
knives
Well
said
Merry
never
expected
see
those
again
marked
few
orcs
with
mine
but
Ugluk
took
them
from
How
glared
first
thought
was
going
stab
but
threw
the
things
away
they
burned
him
And
here
also
your
brooch
Pippin
said
Aragorn
have
kept
safe
for
very
precious
thing
know
said
Pippin
was
wrench
let
but
what
else
could
Nothing
else
answered
Aragorn
One
who
cannot
cast
away
treasure
need
fetters
You
did
rightly
The
cutting
the
bands
your
wrists
that
was
smart
work
said
Gimli
Luck
served
you
there
but
you
seized
your
chance
with
both
hands
one
might
say
And
set
pretty
riddle
said
Legolas
wondered
you
had
grown
wings
Unfortunately
not
said
Pippin
But
you
did
not
know
about
Grishnakh
shuddered
and
said
more
leaving
Merry
tell
those
last
horrible
moments
the
pawing
hands
the
hot
breath
and
the
dreadful
strength
Grishnakh
hairy
arms
All
this
about
the
Orcs
Barad
dar
Lugburz
they
call
makes
uneasy
said
Aragorn
The
Dark
Lord
already
knew
too
much
and
his
servants
also
and
Grishnakh
evidently
sent
some
message
across
the
River
after
the
quarrel
The
Red
Eye
will
looking
towards
Isengard
But
Saruman
any
rate
cleft
stick
his
own
cutting
Yes
whichever
side
wins
his
outlook
poor
said
Merry
Things
began
all
wrong
for
him
from
the
moment
his
Orcs
set
foot
Rohan
caught
glimpse
the
old
villain
Gandalf
hints
said
Gimli
the
edge
the
Forest
When
was
that
asked
Pippin
Five
nights
ago
said
Aragorn
Let
see
said
Merry
five
nights
ago
now
come
part
the
story
you
know
nothing
about
met
Treebeard
that
morning
after
the
battle
and
that
night
were
Wellinghall
one
his
ent
houses
The
next
morning
went
Entmoot
gathering
Ents
that
and
the
queerest
thing
have
ever
seen
life
lasted
all
that
day
and
the
next
and
spent
the
nights
with
Ent
called
Quickbeam
And
then
late
the
afternoon
the
third
day
FLOTSAM
AND
JETSAM
565
their
moot
the
Ents
suddenly
blew
was
amazing
The
Forest
had
felt
tense
thunderstorm
was
brewing
inside
then
all
once
exploded
wish
you
could
have
heard
their
song
they
marched
Saruman
had
heard
would
hundred
miles
away
now
even
had
had
run
his
own
legs
said
Pippin
Though
Isengard
strong
and
hard
cold
stone
and
bare
bone
war
hew
the
stone
and
break
the
door
There
was
very
much
more
great
deal
the
song
had
words
and
was
like
music
horns
and
drums
was
very
exciting
But
thought
was
only
marching
music
and
more
just
song
until
got
here
know
better
now
came
down
over
the
last
ridge
into
Nan
Curunir
after
night
had
fallen
Merry
continued
was
then
that
first
had
the
feeling
that
the
Forest
itself
was
moving
behind
thought
was
dreaming
entish
dream
but
Pippin
had
noticed
too
were
both
fright
ened
but
did
not
find
out
more
about
until
later
was
the
Huorns
the
Ents
call
them
short
language
Treebeard
won
say
much
about
them
but
think
they
are
Ents
that
have
become
almost
like
trees
least
look
They
stand
here
and
there
the
wood
under
its
eaves
silent
watching
end
lessly
over
the
trees
but
deep
the
darkest
dales
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
them
believe
There
great
power
them
and
they
seem
able
wrap
themselves
shadow
difficult
see
them
moving
But
they
They
can
move
very
quickly
they
are
angry
You
stand
still
looking
the
weather
maybe
listening
the
rustling
the
wind
and
then
suddenly
you
find
that
you
are
the
middle
wood
with
great
groping
trees
all
around
you
They
still
have
voices
and
can
speak
with
the
Ents
that
why
they
are
called
Huorns
Tree
beard
says
but
they
have
become
queer
and
wild
Dangerous
should
terrified
meeting
them
there
were
true
Ents
about
look
after
them
Well
the
early
night
crept
down
long
ravine
into
the
upper
end
the
Wizard
Vale
the
Ents
with
all
their
rustling
Huorns
behind
could
not
see
them
course
but
the
whole
air
was
full
creaking
was
very
dark
cloudy
night
They
moved
great
speed
soon
they
had
left
the
hills
and
made
noise
like
rushing
wind
The
Moon
did
not
appear
through
the
clouds
and
not
long
after
midnight
there
was
tall
wood
all
round
the
north
side
Isengard
There
was
sign
enemies
nor
any
challenge
566
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
There
was
light
gleaming
from
high
window
the
tower
that
was
all
Treebeard
and
few
more
Ents
crept
right
round
within
sight
the
great
gates
Pippin
and
were
with
him
were
sitting
Treebeard
shoulders
and
could
feel
the
quivering
tenseness
him
But
even
when
they
are
roused
Ents
can
very
cautious
and
patient
They
stood
still
carved
stones
breathing
and
listening
Then
all
once
there
was
tremendous
stir
Trumpets
blared
and
the
walls
Isengard
echoed
thought
that
had
been
discovered
and
that
battle
was
going
begin
But
nothing
the
sort
All
Saruman
people
were
marching
away
don
know
much
about
this
war
about
the
Horsemen
Rohan
but
Saruman
seems
have
meant
finish
off
the
king
and
all
his
men
with
one
final
blow
emptied
Isengard
saw
the
enemy
endless
lines
marching
Orcs
and
troops
them
mounted
great
wolves
And
there
were
battalions
Men
too
Many
them
carried
torches
and
the
flare
could
see
their
faces
Most
them
were
ordinary
men
rather
tall
and
dark
haired
and
grim
but
not
particularly
evil
looking
But
there
were
some
others
that
were
horrible
man
high
but
with
goblin
faces
sallow
leering
squint
eyed
you
know
they
reminded
once
that
Southerner
Bree
only
was
not
obviously
orc
like
most
these
were
thought
him
too
said
Aragorn
had
many
these
half
orcs
deal
with
Helm
Deep
seems
plain
now
that
that
Southerner
was
spy
Saruman
but
whether
was
working
with
the
Black
Riders
for
Saruman
alone
not
know
difficult
with
these
evil
folk
know
when
they
are
league
and
when
they
are
cheating
one
another
Well
all
sorts
together
there
must
have
been
ten
thousand
the
very
least
said
Merry
They
took
hour
pass
out
the
gates
Some
went
off
down
the
highway
the
Fords
and
some
turned
away
and
went
eastward
bridge
has
been
built
down
there
about
mile
away
where
the
river
runs
very
deep
channel
You
could
see
now
you
stood
They
were
all
singing
with
harsh
voices
and
laughing
making
hideous
din
thought
things
looked
very
black
for
Rohan
But
Treebeard
did
not
move
said
business
with
Isengard
tonight
with
rock
and
stone
But
though
could
not
see
what
was
happening
the
dark
believe
that
Huorns
began
move
south
soon
the
gates
were
shut
again
Their
business
was
with
Orcs
think
They
were
far
down
the
valley
the
morning
any
rate
there
was
shadow
there
that
one
couldn
see
through
soon
Saruman
had
sent
off
all
his
army
our
turn
came
Treebeard
put
down
and
went
the
gates
and
began
ham
FLOTSAM
AND
JETSAM
567
mering
the
doors
and
calling
for
Saruman
There
was
answer
except
arrows
and
stones
from
the
walls
But
arrows
are
use
against
Ents
They
hurt
them
course
and
infuriate
them
like
stinging
flies
But
Ent
can
stuck
full
orc
arrows
pin
cushion
and
take
serious
harm
They
cannot
poisoned
for
one
thing
and
their
skin
seems
very
thick
and
tougher
than
bark
takes
very
heavy
axe
stroke
wound
them
seriously
They
don
like
axes
But
there
would
have
great
many
axe
men
one
Ent
man
that
hacks
once
Ent
never
gets
chance
second
blow
punch
from
Ent
fist
crumples
iron
like
thin
tin
When
Treebeard
had
got
few
arrows
him
began
warm
get
positively
hasty
would
say
let
out
great
hoom
hom
and
dozen
more
Ents
came
striding
angry
Ent
terrifying
Their
fingers
and
their
toes
just
freeze
rock
and
they
tear
like
bread
crust
was
like
watching
the
work
great
tree
roots
hundred
years
all
packed
into
few
moments
They
pushed
pulled
tore
shook
and
hammered
and
clang
bang
crash
crack
five
minutes
they
had
these
huge
gates
just
lying
ruin
and
some
were
already
beginning
eat
into
the
walls
like
rabbits
sand
pit
don
know
what
Saruman
thought
was
hap
pening
but
anyway
did
not
know
how
deal
with
His
wizardry
may
have
been
falling
off
lately
course
but
anyway
think
has
not
much
grit
not
much
plain
courage
alone
tight
place
without
lot
slaves
and
machines
and
things
you
know
what
mean
Very
different
from
old
Gandalf
wonder
his
fame
was
not
all
along
mainly
due
his
cleverness
settling
Isengard
said
Aragorn
Once
was
great
his
fame
made
him
His
knowledge
was
deep
his
thought
was
subtle
and
his
hands
mar
vellously
skilled
and
had
power
over
the
minds
others
The
wise
could
persuade
and
the
smaller
folk
could
daunt
That
power
certainly
still
keeps
There
are
not
many
Middle
earth
that
should
say
were
safe
they
were
left
alone
talk
with
him
even
now
when
has
suffered
defeat
Gandalf
Elrond
and
Galadriel
perhaps
now
that
his
wickedness
has
been
laid
bare
but
very
few
others
The
Ents
are
safe
said
Pippin
seems
one
time
have
got
round
them
but
never
again
And
anyway
did
not
understand
them
and
made
the
great
mistake
leaving
them
out
his
calculations
had
plan
for
them
and
there
was
time
make
any
once
they
had
set
work
soon
our
attack
began
the
few
remaining
rats
Isengard
started
bolting
through
every
hole
that
the
Ents
made
The
Ents
let
the
Men
after
they
had
ques
tioned
them
two
three
dozen
only
down
this
end
don
think
568
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
many
orc
folk
any
size
escaped
Not
from
the
Huorns
there
was
wood
full
them
all
round
Isengard
that
time
well
those
that
had
gone
down
the
valley
When
the
Ents
had
reduced
large
part
the
southern
walls
rubbish
and
what
was
left
his
people
had
bolted
and
deserted
him
Saruman
fled
panic
seems
have
been
the
gates
when
arrived
expect
came
watch
his
splendid
army
march
out
When
the
Ents
broke
their
way
left
hurry
They
did
not
spot
him
first
But
the
night
had
opened
out
and
there
was
great
light
stars
quite
enough
for
Ents
see
and
suddenly
Quickbeam
gave
cry
The
tree
killer
the
tree
killer
Quickbeam
gentle
creature
but
hates
Saruman
all
the
more
fiercely
for
that
his
people
suffered
cruelly
from
orc
axes
leapt
down
the
path
from
the
inner
gate
and
can
move
like
wind
when
roused
There
was
pale
figure
hurrying
away
and
out
the
shadows
the
pillars
and
had
nearly
reached
the
stairs
the
tower
door
But
was
near
thing
Quickbeam
was
hot
after
him
that
was
within
step
two
being
caught
and
strangled
when
slipped
through
the
door
When
Saruman
was
safe
back
Orthanc
was
not
long
before
set
some
his
precious
machinery
work
that
time
there
were
many
Ents
inside
Isengard
some
had
followed
Quickbeam
and
others
had
burst
from
the
north
and
east
they
were
roaming
about
and
doing
great
deal
damage
Suddenly
came
fires
and
foul
fumes
the
vents
and
shafts
all
over
the
plain
began
spout
and
belch
Several
the
Ents
got
scorched
and
blistered
One
them
Beechbone
think
was
called
very
tall
handsome
Ent
got
caught
spray
some
liquid
fire
and
burned
like
torch
horrible
sight
That
sent
them
mad
thought
that
they
had
been
really
roused
before
but
was
wrong
saw
what
was
like
last
was
stagger
ing
They
roared
and
boomed
and
trumpeted
until
stones
began
crack
and
fall
the
mere
noise
them
Merry
and
lay
the
ground
and
stuffed
our
cloaks
into
our
ears
Round
and
round
the
rock
Orthanc
the
Ents
went
striding
and
storming
like
howling
gale
breaking
pillars
hurling
avalanches
boulders
down
the
shafts
tossing
huge
slabs
stone
into
the
air
like
leaves
The
tower
was
the
middle
spinning
whirlwind
saw
iron
posts
and
blocks
masonry
rocketing
hundreds
feet
and
smash
against
the
windows
Orthanc
But
Treebeard
kept
his
head
had
not
had
any
burns
luckily
did
not
want
his
folk
hurt
themselves
their
fury
and
did
not
want
Saruman
escape
out
some
hole
the
confusion
Many
the
Ents
were
hurling
themselves
against
the
Orthanc
rock
but
that
defeated
them
very
smooth
and
hard
Some
wizardry
perhaps
older
and
stronger
than
Saruman
FLOTSAM
AND
JETSAM
569
Anyway
they
could
not
get
grip
make
crack
and
they
were
bruising
and
wounding
themselves
against
Treebeard
went
out
into
the
ring
and
shouted
His
enormous
voice
rose
above
all
the
din
There
was
dead
silence
suddenly
heard
shrill
laugh
from
high
window
the
tower
That
had
queer
effect
the
Ents
They
had
been
boiling
over
now
they
became
cold
grim
ice
and
quiet
They
left
the
plain
and
gathered
round
Treebeard
standing
quite
still
spoke
them
for
little
their
own
language
think
was
telling
them
plan
had
made
his
old
head
long
before
Then
they
just
faded
silently
away
the
grey
light
Day
was
dawning
that
time
They
set
watch
the
tower
believe
but
the
watchers
were
well
hidden
shadows
and
kept
still
that
could
not
see
them
The
others
went
away
north
All
that
day
they
were
busy
out
sight
Most
the
time
were
left
alone
was
dreary
day
and
wandered
about
bit
though
kept
out
the
view
the
windows
Orthanc
much
could
they
stared
threateningly
good
deal
the
time
spent
looking
for
something
eat
And
also
sat
and
talked
wondering
what
was
happening
away
south
Rohan
and
what
had
become
all
the
rest
our
Company
Every
now
and
then
could
hear
the
distance
the
rattle
and
fall
stone
and
thudding
noises
echoing
the
hills
the
afternoon
walked
round
the
circle
and
went
have
look
what
was
going
There
was
great
shadowy
wood
Huorns
the
head
the
valley
and
another
round
the
northern
wall
did
not
dare
But
there
was
rending
tearing
noise
work
going
inside
Ents
and
Huorns
were
digging
great
pits
and
trenches
and
making
great
pools
and
dams
gathering
all
the
waters
the
Isen
and
every
other
spring
and
stream
that
they
could
find
left
them
dusk
Treebeard
came
back
the
gate
was
humming
and
booming
himself
and
seemed
pleased
stood
and
stretched
his
great
arms
and
legs
and
breathed
deep
asked
him
was
tired
Tired
said
tired
Well
not
tired
but
stiff
need
good
draught
Entwash
have
worked
hard
have
done
more
stone
cracking
and
earth
gnawing
today
than
have
done
many
long
year
before
But
nearly
finished
When
night
falls
not
linger
near
this
gate
the
old
tunnel
Water
may
come
through
and
will
foul
water
for
while
until
all
the
filth
Saruman
washed
away
Then
Isen
can
run
clean
again
began
pull
down
bit
more
the
walls
leisurely
sort
way
just
amuse
himself
were
just
wondering
where
would
safe
lie
and
get
some
sleep
when
the
most
amazing
thing
all
happened
There
570
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
was
the
sound
rider
coming
swiftly
the
road
Merry
and
lay
quiet
and
Treebeard
hid
himself
the
shadows
under
the
arch
Suddenly
great
horse
came
striding
like
flash
silver
was
already
dark
but
could
see
the
rider
face
clearly
seemed
shine
and
all
his
clothes
were
white
just
sat
staring
with
mouth
open
tried
call
out
and
couldn
There
was
need
halted
just
and
looked
down
Gandalf
said
last
but
voice
was
only
whisper
Did
say
Hullo
Pippin
This
pleasant
surprise
indeed
said
Get
you
tom
fool
Took
Where
the
name
wonder
all
this
ruin
Treebeard
want
him
Quick
Treebeard
heard
his
voice
and
came
out
the
shadows
once
and
there
was
strange
meeting
was
surprised
because
neither
them
seemed
surprised
all
Gandalf
obviously
expected
find
Treebeard
here
and
Treebeard
might
almost
have
been
loitering
about
near
the
gates
purpose
meet
him
Yet
had
told
the
old
Ent
all
about
Moria
But
then
remembered
queer
look
gave
the
time
can
only
suppose
that
had
seen
Gandalf
had
some
news
him
but
would
not
say
anything
hurry
Don
hasty
his
motto
but
nobody
not
even
Elves
will
say
much
about
Gandalf
movements
when
not
there
Hoom
Gandalf
said
Treebeard
glad
you
have
come
Wood
and
water
stock
and
stone
can
master
but
there
Wizard
manage
here
Treebeard
said
Gandalf
need
your
help
You
have
done
much
but
need
more
have
about
ten
thousand
Orcs
manage
Then
those
two
went
off
and
had
council
together
some
corner
must
have
seemed
very
hasty
Treebeard
for
Gandalf
was
tremendous
hurry
and
was
already
talking
great
pace
before
they
passed
out
hearing
They
were
only
away
matter
minutes
perhaps
quarter
hour
Then
Gandalf
came
back
and
seemed
relieved
almost
merry
did
say
was
glad
see
then
But
Gandalf
cried
where
have
you
been
And
have
you
seen
the
others
Wherever
have
been
back
answered
the
genuine
Gandalf
manner
Yes
have
seen
some
the
others
But
news
must
wait
This
perilous
night
and
must
ride
fast
But
the
dawn
may
brighter
and
shall
meet
again
Take
care
yourselves
and
keep
away
from
Orthanc
Good
bye
Treebeard
was
very
thoughtful
after
Gandalf
had
gone
had
evidently
learnt
lot
short
time
and
was
digesting
looked
and
said
well
find
you
are
not
such
hasty
folk
thought
You
said
much
less
than
you
might
and
more
than
you
FLOTSAM
AND
JETSAM
S71
should
this
bundle
news
and
mistake
Well
now
Treebeard
must
get
busy
again
Before
went
got
little
news
out
him
and
did
not
cheer
all
But
for
the
moment
thought
more
about
you
three
than
about
Frodo
and
Sam
about
poor
Boromir
For
gathered
that
there
was
great
battle
going
soon
would
and
that
you
were
and
might
never
come
out
Huorns
will
help
said
Treebeard
Then
went
away
and
did
not
see
him
again
until
this
morning
was
deep
night
lay
top
pile
stone
and
could
see
nothing
beyond
Mist
shadows
blotted
out
everything
like
great
blanket
all
round
The
air
seemed
hot
and
heavy
and
was
full
rustlings
creakings
and
murmur
like
voices
passing
think
that
hundreds
more
the
Huorns
must
have
been
passing
help
the
battle
Later
there
was
great
rumble
thunder
away
south
and
flashes
lightning
far
away
across
Rohan
Every
now
and
then
could
see
mountain
peaks
miles
and
miles
away
stab
out
sud
denly
black
and
white
and
then
vanish
And
behind
there
were
noises
like
thunder
hills
but
different
times
the
whole
valley
echoed
must
have
been
about
midnight
when
the
Ents
broke
the
dams
and
poured
all
the
gathered
waters
through
gap
the
northern
wall
down
into
Isengard
The
Huorn
dark
had
passed
and
the
thun
der
had
rolled
away
The
Moon
was
sinking
behind
the
western
mountains
Isengard
began
fill
with
black
creeping
streams
and
pools
They
glittered
the
last
light
the
Moon
they
spread
over
the
plain
Every
now
and
then
the
waters
found
their
way
down
into
some
shaft
spouthole
Great
white
steams
hissed
Smoke
rose
billows
There
were
explosions
and
gusts
fire
One
great
coil
vapour
went
whirling
twisting
round
and
round
Orthanc
until
looked
like
tall
peak
cloud
fiery
underneath
and
moonlit
above
And
still
more
water
poured
until
last
Isengard
looked
like
huge
flat
saucepan
all
steaming
and
bubbling
saw
cloud
smoke
and
steam
from
the
south
last
night
when
came
the
mouth
Nan
Curunir
said
Aragorn
feared
that
Saruman
was
brewing
some
new
devilry
for
Not
said
Pippin
was
probably
choking
and
not
laughing
any
more
the
morning
yesterday
morning
the
water
had
sunk
down
into
all
the
holes
and
there
was
dense
fog
took
refuge
that
guardroom
over
there
and
had
rather
fright
The
lake
began
overflow
and
pour
out
through
the
old
tunnel
and
the
water
was
rapidly
rising
the
steps
thought
were
going
get
572
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
caught
like
Orcs
hole
but
found
winding
stair
the
back
the
store
room
that
brought
out
top
the
arch
was
squeeze
get
out
the
passages
had
been
cracked
and
half
blocked
with
fallen
stone
near
the
top
There
sat
high
above
the
floods
and
watched
the
drowning
Isengard
The
Ents
kept
pouring
more
water
till
all
the
fires
were
quenched
and
every
cave
filled
The
fogs
slowly
gathered
together
and
steamed
into
huge
umbrella
cloud
must
have
been
mile
high
the
evening
there
was
great
rainbow
over
the
eastern
hills
and
then
the
sunset
was
blotted
out
thick
drizzle
the
mountain
sides
all
went
very
quiet
few
wolves
howled
mournfully
far
away
The
Ents
stopped
the
inflow
the
night
and
sent
the
Isen
back
into
its
old
course
And
that
was
the
end
all
Since
then
the
water
has
been
sinking
again
There
must
outlets
somewhere
from
the
caves
underneath
think
Saruman
peeps
out
any
his
windows
must
look
untidy
dreary
mess
felt
very
lonely
Not
even
visible
Ent
talk
all
the
ruin
and
news
spent
the
night
top
there
above
the
arch
and
was
cold
and
damp
and
did
not
sleep
had
feeling
that
anything
might
happen
any
minute
Saruman
still
his
tower
There
was
noise
the
night
like
wind
coming
the
valley
think
the
Ents
and
Huorns
that
had
been
away
came
back
then
but
where
they
have
all
gone
now
don
know
was
misty
moisty
morning
when
climbed
down
and
looked
round
again
and
nobody
was
about
And
that
about
all
there
tell
seems
almost
peaceful
now
after
all
the
turmoil
And
safer
too
somehow
since
Gandalf
came
back
could
sleep
They
all
fell
silent
for
while
Gimli
filled
his
pipe
There
one
thing
wonder
about
said
lit
with
his
flint
and
tinder
Wormtongue
You
told
Théoden
was
with
Saruman
How
did
get
there
yes
forgot
about
him
said
Pippin
did
not
get
here
till
this
morning
had
just
lit
the
fire
and
had
some
breakfast
when
Treebeard
appeared
again
heard
him
hooming
and
calling
our
names
outside
have
just
come
round
see
how
you
are
faring
lads
said
and
give
you
some
news
Huorns
have
come
back
All
well
aye
very
well
indeed
laughed
and
slapped
his
thighs
more
Orcs
Isengard
more
axes
And
there
will
folk
coming
from
the
South
before
the
day
old
some
that
you
may
glad
see
had
hardly
said
that
when
heard
the
sound
hoofs
the
road
rushed
out
before
the
gates
and
stood
and
stared
FLOTSAM
AND
JETSAM
573
half
expecting
see
Strider
and
Gandalf
come
riding
the
head
army
But
out
the
mist
there
rode
man
old
tired
horse
and
looked
queer
twisted
sort
creature
himself
There
was
one
else
When
came
out
the
mist
and
suddenly
saw
all
the
ruin
and
wreckage
front
him
sat
and
gaped
and
his
face
went
almost
green
was
bewildered
that
did
not
seem
notice
first
When
did
gave
cry
and
tried
turn
his
horse
round
and
ride
off
But
Treebeard
took
three
strides
put
out
long
arm
and
lifted
him
out
the
saddle
His
horse
bolted
terror
and
grovelled
the
ground
said
was
Grima
friend
and
counsellor
the
king
and
had
been
sent
with
important
mes
sages
from
Theoden
Saruman
Nlo
one
else
would
dare
ride
through
the
open
land
full
foul
Orcs
said
was
sent
And
have
had
perilous
journey
and
hungry
and
weary
fled
far
north
out
way
pursued
wolves
caught
the
sidelong
looks
gave
Treebeard
and
said
myself
liar
Treebeard
looked
him
his
long
slow
way
for
several
minutes
till
the
wretched
man
was
squirming
the
floor
Then
last
said
was
expecting
you
Master
Worm
tongue
The
man
started
that
name
Gandalf
got
here
first
know
much
about
you
need
and
know
what
with
you
Put
all
the
rats
one
trap
said
Gandalf
and
will
the
master
Isengard
now
but
Saruman
locked
his
tower
and
you
can
there
and
give
him
all
the
messages
that
you
can
think
Tet
let
said
Wormtongue
know
the
way
You
knew
the
way
don
doubt
said
Treebeard
But
things
have
changed
here
little
and
see
let
Wormtongue
and
limped
off
through
the
arch
with
close
behind
until
came
inside
the
ring
and
could
see
all
the
floods
that
lay
between
him
and
Orthanc
Then
turned
Tet
away
whined
Let
away
messages
are
useless
now
They
are
indeed
said
Treebeard
But
you
have
only
two
choices
stay
with
until
Gandalf
and
your
master
arrive
cross
the
water
Which
will
you
have
The
man
shivered
the
mention
his
master
and
put
foot
into
the
water
but
drew
back
cannot
swim
said
The
water
not
deep
said
Treebeard
dirty
but
that
will
not
harm
you
Master
Wormtongue
you
now
With
that
the
wretch
floundered
off
into
the
flood
rose
nearly
his
neck
before
got
too
far
away
for
see
him
The
last
saw
him
was
clinging
some
old
barrel
piece
wood
But
Treebeard
waded
after
him
and
watched
his
progress
574
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Well
has
gone
said
when
returned
saw
him
crawling
the
steps
like
draggled
rat
There
someone
the
tower
still
hand
came
out
and
pulled
him
there
and
hope
the
welcome
his
liking
Now
must
and
wash
myself
clean
the
slime
Pll
away
the
north
side
anyone
wants
see
There
clean
water
down
here
fit
for
Ent
drink
bathe
will
ask
you
two
lads
keep
watch
the
gate
for
the
folk
that
are
coming
There
the
Lord
the
Fields
Rohan
mark
you
You
must
welcome
him
well
you
know
how
his
men
have
fought
great
fight
with
the
Orcs
Maybe
you
know
the
right
fashion
Men
words
for
such
lord
better
than
Ents
There
have
been
many
lords
the
green
fields
time
and
have
never
learned
their
speech
their
names
They
will
wanting
man
food
and
you
know
all
about
that
guess
find
what
you
think
fit
for
king
eat
you
can
And
that
the
end
the
story
Though
should
like
know
who
this
Wormtongue
Was
really
the
king
counsellor
was
said
Aragorn
and
also
Saruman
spy
and
servant
Rohan
Fate
has
not
been
kinder
him
than
deserves
The
sight
the
ruin
all
that
thought
strong
and
magnificent
must
have
been
almost
punishment
enough
But
fear
that
worse
awaits
him
Yes
don
suppose
Treebeard
sent
him
Orthanc
out
kind
ness
said
Merry
seemed
rather
grimly
delighted
with
the
business
and
was
laughing
himself
when
went
get
his
bathe
and
drink
spent
busy
time
after
that

But
Treebeard
sent
some
Ents
down
and
they
carried
off
great

food
for
twenty
five
the
Ents
said
you
can
see
that
somebody
had
counted
your

carefully
before

You

Better

What
about
drink
said
the
Ents
There
water
Isen
they
said
and
that
good
enough
for
Ents
and
Men
But
hope
that
the
Ents
may
have
found
time
brew
some
their
draughts
from
the
mountain
springs
and
shall
see
Gandalf

curling
when
returns
After
the

had
gone
felt
tired
and
hungry
But
did
not

our

been

was
through

THE
VOICE
SARUMAN
They
passed
through
the
ruined
tunnel
and
stood
upon
heap
stones
gazing
the
dark
rock
Orthanc
and
its
many
windows
menace
still
the
desolation
that
lay
all
about
The
waters
had
now
nearly
all
subsided
Here
and
there
gloomy
pools
remained
covered
with
scum
and
wreckage
but
most
the
wide
circle
was
bare
again
wilderness
slime
and
tumbled
rock
pitted
with
black
ened
holes
and
dotted
with
posts
and
pillars
leaning
drunkenly
this
way
and
that
the
rim
the
shattered
bowl
there
lay
vast
mounds
and
slopes
like
the
shingles
cast
great
storm
and
beyond
them
the
green
and
tangled
valley
ran
into
the
long
ravine
between
the
dark
arms
the
mountains
Across
the
waste
they
saw
riders
picking
their
way
they
were
coming
from
the
north
side
and
already
they
were
drawing
near
Orthanc
There
Gandalf
and
Théoden
and
his
men
said
Legolas
Let
and
meet
them
Walk
warily
said
Merry
There
are
loose
slabs
that
may
tilt
and
throw
you
down
into
pit
you
don
take
care
They
followed
what
was
left
the
road
from
the
gates
Orthanc
going
slowly
for
the
flag
stones
were
cracked
and
slimed
The
riders
seeing
them
approach
halted
under
the
shadow
the
rock
and
waited
for
them
Gandalf
rode
forward
meet
them
Well
Treebeard
and
have
had
some
interesting
discussions
and
made
few
plans
said
and
have
all
had
some
much
needed
rest
Now
must
going
again
hope
you
companions
have
all
rested
too
and
refreshed
yourselves
have
said
Merry
But
our
discussions
began
and
ended
smoke
Still
feel
less
ill
disposed
towards
Saruman
than
did
you
indeed
said
Gandalf
Well
not
have
now
last
task
before
must
pay
Saruman
farewell
visit
Dangerous
and
probably
useless
but
must
done
Those
you
who
wish
may
come
with
but
beware
And
not
jest
This
not
the
time
for
will
come
said
Gimli
wish
see
him
and
learn
really
looks
like
you
And
how
will
you
learn
that
Master
Dwarf
said
Gandalf
Saruman
could
look
like
your
eyes
suited
his
purpose
with
you
And
are
you
yet
wise
enough
detect
all
his
counterfeits
THE
VOICE
SARUMAN
577
Well
shall
see
perhaps
may
shy
showing
himself
before
many
different
eyes
together
But
have
ordered
all
the
Ents
remove
themselves
from
sight
perhaps
shall
persuade
him
come
out
What
the
danger
asked
Pippin
Will
shoot
and
pour
fire
out
the
windows
can
put
spell
from
distance
The
last
most
likely
you
ride
his
door
with
light
heart
said
Gandalf
But
there
knowing
what
can
may
choose
try
wild
beast
cornered
not
safe
approach
And
Saruman
has
powers
you
not
guess
Beware
his
voice
They
came
now
the
foot
Orthanc
was
black
and
the
rock
gleamed
were
wet
The
many
faces
the
stone
had
sharp
edges
though
they
had
been
newly
chiselled
few
scorings
and
small
flake
like
splinters
near
the
base
were
all
the
marks
that
bore
the
fury
the
Ents
the
eastern
side
the
angle
two
piers
there
was
great
door
high
above
the
ground
and
over
was
shuttered
window
opening
upon
balcony
hedged
with
iron
bars
the
threshold
the
door
there
mounted
flight
twenty
seven
broad
stairs
hewn
some
unknown
art
the
same
black
stone
This
was
the
only
entrance
the
tower
but
many
tall
windows
were
cut
with
deep
embrasures
the
climbing
walls
far
they
peered
like
little
eyes
the
sheer
faces
the
horns
the
foot
the
stairs
Gandalf
and
the
king
dismounted
will
said
Gandalf
have
been
Orthanc
and
know
peril
And
too
will
said
the
king
old
and
fear
peril
any
more
wish
speak
with
the
enemy
who
has
done
much
wrong
Eomer
shall
come
with
and
see
that
aged
feet
not
falter
you
will
said
Gandalf
Aragorn
shall
come
with
Let
the
others
await
the
foot
the
stairs
They
will
hear
and
see
enough
there
anything
hear
see
Nay
said
Gimli
Legolas
and
wish
for
closer
view
alone
here
represent
our
kindreds
also
will
come
behind
Come
then
said
Gandalf
and
with
that
climbed
the
steps
and
Theoden
went
beside
him
The
Riders
Rohan
sat
uneasily
upon
their
horses
either
side
the
stair
and
looked
darkly
the
great
tower
fearing
what
might
befall
their
lord
Merry
and
Pippin
sat
the
bottom
step
feeling
both
unimportant
and
unsafe
Half
sticky
mile
from
here
the
gate
muttered
Pippin
wish
could
slip
off
back
the
guardroom
unnoticed
What
did
come
for
are
not
wanted
578
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Gandalf
stood
before
the
door
Orthanc
and
beat
with
his
staff
rang
with
hollow
sound
Saruman
Saruman
cried
loud
commanding
voice
Saruman
come
forth
For
some
time
there
was
answer
last
the
window
above
the
door
was
unbarred
but
figure
could
seen
its
dark
opening
Who
said
voice
What
you
wish
Theoden
started
know
that
voice
said
and
curse
the
day
when
first
listened
and
fetch
Saruman
since
you
have
become
his
footman
Grima
Wormtongue
said
Gandalf
And
not
waste
our
time
The
window
closed
They
waited
Suddenly
another
voice
spoke
low
and
melodious
its
very
sound
enchantment
Those
who
listened
unwarily
that
voice
could
seldom
report
the
words
that
they
heard
and
they
did
they
wondered
for
little
power
remained
them
Mostly
they
remembered
only
that
was
delight
hear
the
voice
speaking
all
that
said
seemed
wise
and
reasonable
and
desire
awoke
them
swift
agreement
seem
wise
themselves
When
others
spoke
they
seemed
harsh
and
uncouth
contrast
and
they
gainsaid
the
voice
anger
was
kindled
the
hearts
those
under
the
spell
For
some
the
spell
lasted
only
while
the
voice
spoke
them
and
when
spoke
another
they
smiled
men
who
see
through
juggler
trick
while
others
gape
For
many
the
sound
the
voice
alone
was
enough
hold
them
enthralled
but
for
those
whom
conquered
the
spell
endured
when
they
were
far
away
and
ever
they
heard
that
soft
voice
whispering
and
urging
them
But
none
were
unmoved
none
rejected
its
pleas
and
its
commands
without
effort
mind
and
will
long
its
master
had
control
Well
said
now
with
gentle
question
Why
must
you
disturb
rest
Will
you
give
peace
all
night
day
Its
tone
was
that
kindly
heart
aggrieved
injuries
undeserved
They
looked
astonished
for
they
had
heard
sound
his
coming
and
they
saw
figure
standing
the
rail
looking
down
upon
them
old
man
swathed
great
cloak
the
colour
which
was
not
easy
tell
for
changed
they
moved
their
eyes
stirred
His
face
was
long
with
high
forehead
had
deep
darkling
eyes
hard
fathom
though
the
look
that
they
now
bore
was
grave
and
benevolent
and
little
weary
His
hair
and
beard
were
white
but
strands
black
still
showed
about
his
lips
and
ears
Like
and
yet
unlike
muttered
Gimli
But
come
now
said
the
soft
voice
Two
least
you
know
name
Gandalf
know
too
well
have
much
hope
that
seeks
help
counsel
here
But
you
Theoden
Lord

Mark
Rohan
are
declared
your
noble
devices
and
still
more

ance
the
House
Eorl
worthy
son
Thengel
the
Thrice

Why
have
you
not
come
before
and
friend
Much
have
desired
see
you
mightiest
king
western
lands
and
especi
ally
these
latter
years
save
you
from
the
unwise
and
evil
counsels
that
beset
you
yet
too
late
Despite
the
injuries
that
have
been
done
which
the
men
Rohan
alas
have
had
some
part
still
would
save
you
and
deliver
you
from
the
ruin
that
draws
nigh
inevitably
you
ride
upon
this
road
which
you
have
taken
Indeed
alone
can
aid
you
now
Theoden
opened
his
mouth
speak
but
said
nothing
looked
the
face
Saruman
with
its
dark
solemn
eyes
bent
down
upon
him
and
then
Gandalf
his
side
and
seemed
hesitate
Gandalf
made
sign
but
stood
silent
stone
one
waiting
patiently
for
some
call
that
has
not
yet
come
The
Riders
stirred
first
murmuring
with
approval
the
words
Saruman
and
then
they
too
were
silent
men
spell
bound
seemed
them
that
Gandalf
had
never
spoken
fair
and
fittingly
their
lord
Rough
and
proud
now
seemed
all
his
dealings
with
Théoden
And
over
their
hearts
crept
shadow
the
fear
great
danger
the
end
the
Mark
darkness
which
Gandalf
was
driving
them
while
Saruman
stood
beside
door
escape
holding
half
open
that
ray
light
came
through
There
was
heavy
silence
was
Gimli
the
dwarf
who
broke
suddenly
The
words
this
wizard
stand
their
heads
growled
gripping
the
handle
his
axe
the
language
Orthanc
help
means
ruin
and
saving
means
slaying
that
plain
But
not
come
here
beg
Peace
said
Saruman
and
for
fleeting
moment
his
voice
was
less
suave
and
light
flickered
his
eyes
and
was
gone
not
speak
you
yet
Gimli
Gloin
son
said
Far
away
your
home
and
small
concern
yours
are
the
troubles
this
land
But
was
not
design
your
own
that
you
became
embroiled
them
and
will
not
blame
such
part
you
have
played
valiant
one
doubt
not
But
pray
you
allow
first
speak
with
the
King
Rohan
neighbour
and
once
friend
What
have
you
say
Theoden
King
Will
you
have
peace
with
and
all
the
aid
that
knowledge
founded
long
years
can
bring
Shall
make
our
counsels
together
against
evil
days
and
repair
our
injuries
with
such
good
will
that
our
estates
shall
both
come
fairer
flower
than
ever
before
Still
Theoden
did
not
answer
Whether
strove
with
anger

none
could
say
Eomer

Now

the

THE

What
aid
can
give
you
forsooth
All

escape
from

But
will
you
parley
with
this

and
murder
Remember
Théodred

Fords

Hama

Deep
speak

said
Saruman
and
the
flash
his
anger
was
now
plain
see
But
come
Eomer
Eomund
son
went
his
soft
voice
again
every
man
his
part
Valour
arms
yours
and
you
win
high
honour
thereby
Slay
whom
your
lord
names
enemies
and
content
Meddle
not
policies
which
you
not
understand
But
maybe
you
become
king
you
will
find
that
must
choose
his
friends
with
care
The
friendship
Saruman
and
the
power
Orthanc
cannot
lightly
thrown
aside
whatever
grievances
real
fancied
may
lie
behind
You
have
won
battle
but
not
war
and
that
with
help
which
you
cannot
count
again
You
may
find
the
Shadow
the
Wood
your
own
door
next
wayward
and
senseless
and
has
love
for
Men
But
lord
Rohan
called
murderer
because
valiant
men
have
fallen
battle
you
war
needlessly
for
did
not
desire
then
men
will
slain
But
murderer
that
account
then
all
the
House
Eorl
stained
with
murder
for
they
have
fought
many
wars
and
assailed
many
who
defied
them
Yet
with
some
they
have
afterwards
made
peace
none
the
worse
for
being
politic
say
Théoden
King
shall
have
peace
and
friend
ship
you
and
ours
command
will
have
peace
said
Théoden
last
thickly
and
with
effort
Several
the
Riders
cried
out
gladly
Théoden
held
his
hand
Yes
will
have
peace
said
now
clear
voice
will
have
peace
when
you
and
all
your
works
have
perished
and
the
works
your
dark
master
whom
you
would
deliver
You
are
liar
Saruman
and
corrupter
men
hearts
You
hold
out
your
hand
and
perceive
only
finger
the
claw
Mordor
Cruel
and
cold
Even
your
war
was
just
was
not
for
were
you
ten
times
wise
you
would
have
right
rule
and
mine
for
your
own
profit
you
desired
even
what
will
you
say
your
torches
Westfold
and
the
children
that
lie
dead
there
And
they
hewed
Hama
body
before
the
gates
the
Hornburg
after
was
dead
When
you
hang
from
gibbet
your
window
for
the
sport
your
own
crows
will
have
peace
with
you
and
Orthanc
much

lesser

great

but
not

Turn

But

your

The

gazed
Théoden
like
men
startled
out

Harsh
old
raven
their

voice
sounded
their
ears
THE
VOICE
SARUMAN
581
after
the
music
Saruman
But
Saruman
for
while
was
beside
himself
with
wrath
leaned
over
the
rail
would
smite
the
King
with
his
staff
some
suddenly
seemed
that
they
saw
snake
coiling
itself
strike
Gibbets
and
crows
hissed
and
they
shuddered
the
hideous
change
Dotard
What
the
house
Eorl
but
thatched
barn
where
brigands
drink
the
reek
and
their
brats
roll
the
floor
among
the
dogs
Too
long
have
they
escaped
the
gibbet
themselves
But
the
noose
comes
slow
the
drawing
tight
and
hard
the
end
Hang
you
will
Now
his
voice
changed
slowly
mastered
himself
know
not
why
have
had
the
patience
speak
you
For
need
you
not
nor
your
little
band
gallopers
swift
fly
advance
Théoden
Horsemaster
Long
ago
offered
you
state
beyond
your
merit
and
your
wit
have
offered
again
that
those
whom
you
mislead
may
clearly
see
the
choice
roads
You
give
brag
and
abuse
back
your
huts
But
you
Gandalf
For
you
least
grieved
feeling
for
your
shame
How
comes
that
you
can
endure
such
company
For
you
are
proud
Gandalf
and
not
without
reason
having
noble
mind
and
eyes
that
look
both
deep
and
far
Even
now
will
you
not
listen
counsel
Gandalf
stirred
and
looked
What
have
you
say
that
you
did
not
say
our
last
meeting
asked
perhaps
you
have
things
unsay
Saruman
paused
Unsay
mused
puzzled
Unsay
endeavoured
advise
you
for
your
own
good
but
you
scarcely
listened
You
are
proud
and
not
love
advice
having
indeed
store
your
own
wisdom
But
that
occasion
you
erred
think
misconstruing
intentions
wilfully
fear
that
eagerness
persuade
you
lost
patience
And
indeed
regret
For
bore
you
ill
will
and
even
now
bear
none
though
you
return
the
company
the
violent
and
the
ignorant
How
should
Are
not
both
members
high
and
ancient
order
most
excellent
Middle

Our
friendship
would
profit
both
alike
Much
could
still
accomplish
together
heal
the
disorders
the
world
Let
understand
one
another
and
dismiss
from
thought
these
lesser
folk
Let
them
wait
our
decisions
For
the
common
good
willing
redress
the
past
and
receive
you
Will
you
not
consult
with
Will
you
not
come
great
was
the
power
that
Saruman
exerted
this
last
effort
that
none
that
stood
within
hearing
were
unmoved
But
now
the
spell
was
wholly
different
They
heard
the
gentle
remonstrance
kindly
king
with
erring
but
much
loved
minister
But
they
were
shut
out
listening
door
words
not
meant
for
them
ill
mannered
children
582
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
stupid
servants
overhearing
the
elusive
discourse
their
elders
and
wondering
how
would
affect
their
lot
loftier
mould
these
two
were
made
reverend
and
wise
was
inevitable
that
they
should
make
alliance
Gandalf
would
ascend
into
the
tower
discuss
deep
things
beyond
their
comprehension
the
high
chambers
Orthanc
The
door
would
closed
and
they
would
left
outside
dismissed
await
allotted
work
punishment
Even
the
mind
Théoden
the
thought
took
shape
like
shadow
doubt
will
betray
will
shall
lost
Then
Gandalf
laughed
The
fantasy
vanished
like
puff
smoke
Saruman
Saruman
said
Gandalf
still
laughing
Saruman
you
missed
your
path
life
You
should
have
been
the
king
jester
and
earned
your
bread
and
stripes
too
mimicking
his
counsellors
paused
getting
the
better
his
mirth
Understand
one
another
fear
beyond
your
comprehension
But
you
Saruman
understand
now
too
well
keep
clearer
memory
your
argu
ments
and
deeds
than
you
suppose
When
last
visited
you
you
were
the
jailor
Mordor
and
there
was
sent
Nay
the
guest
who
has
escaped
from
the
roof
will
think
twice
before
comes
back
the
door
Nay
not
think
will
come
But
listen
Saruman
for
the
last
time
Will
you
not
come
down
Isengard
has
proved
less
strong
than
your
hope
and
fancy
made
may
other
things
which
you
still
have
trust
Would
not
well
leave
for
while
turn
new
things
perhaps
Think
well
Saruman
Will
you
not
come
down
shadow
passed
over
Saruman
face
then
went
deathly
white
Before
could
conceal
they
saw
through
the
mask
the
anguish
mind
doubt
loathing
stay
and
dreading
leave
its
refuge
For
second
hesitated
and
one
breathed
Then
spoke
and
his
voice
was
shrill
and
cold
Pride
and
hate
were
conquering
him
Will
come
down
mocked
Does
unarmed
man
come
down
speak
with
robbers
out
doors
can
hear
you
well
enough
here
fool
and
not
trust
you
Gandalf
They
not
stand
openly
stairs
but
know
where
the
wild
wood
demons
are
lurking
your
command
The
treacherous
are
ever
distrustful
answered
Gandalf
wearily
But
you
need
not
fear
for
your
skin
not
wish
kill
you
hurt
you
you
would
know
you
really
understood
And
have
the
power
protect
you
giving
you
last
chance
You
can
leave
Orthanc
free
you
choose
That
sounds
well
sneered
Saruman
Very
much
the
manner
Gandalf
the
Grey
condescending
and
very
kind
not
doubt
that
you
would
find
Orthanc
commodious
and
departure
THE
VOICE
SARUMAN
583
convenient
But
why
should
wish
leave
And
what
you
mean
free
There
are
conditions
presume
Reasons
for
leaving
you
can
see
from
your
windows
answered
Gandalf
Others
will
occur
your
thought
Your
servants
are
destroyed
and
scattered
your
neighbours
you
have
made
your
enemies
and
you
have
cheated
your
new
master
tried
When
his
eye
turns
hither
will
the
red
eye
wrath
But
when
say
free
mean
free
free
from
bond
chain
command
where
you
will
even
even
Mordor
Saruman
you
desire
But
you
will
first
surrender
the
Key
Orthanc
and
your
staff
They
shall
pledges
your
conduct
returned
later
you
merit
them
Saruman
face
grew
livid
twisted
with
rage
and
red
light
was
kindled
his
eyes
laughed
wildly
Later
cried
and
his
voice
rose
scream
Later
Yes
when
you
also
have
the
Keys
Barad
dar
itself
suppose
and
the
crowns
seven
kings
and
the
rods
the
Five
Wizards
and
have
purchased
yourself
pair
boots
many
sizes
larger
than
those
that
you
wear
now
modest
plan
Hardly
one
which
help
needed
have
other
things
not
fool
you
wish
treat
with
while
you
have
chance
away
and
come
back
when
you
are
sober
And
leave
behind
these
cut
throats
and
small
rag
tag
that
dangle
your
tail
Good
day
turned
and
left
the
balcony
Come
back
Saruman
said
Gandalf
commanding
voice
the
amazement
the
others
Saruman
turned
again
and
dragged
against
his
will
came
slowly
back
the
iron
rail
leaning
breathing
hard
His
face
was
lined
and
shrunken
His
hand
clutched
his
heavy
black
staff
like
claw
did
not
give
you
leave
said
Gandalf
sternly
have
not
finished
You
have
become
fool
Saruman
and
yet
pitiable
You
might
still
have
turned
away
from
folly
and
evil
and
have
been
service
But
you
choose
stay
and
gnaw
the
ends
your
old
plots
Stay
then
But
warn
you
you
will
not
easily
come
out
again
Not
unless
the
dark
hands
the
East
stretch
out
take
you
Saruman
cried
and
his
voice
grew
power
and
authority
Behold
not
Gandalf
the
Grey
whom
you
betrayed
Gandalf
the
White
who
has
returned
from
death
You
have
colour
now
and
cast
you
from
the
order
and
from
the
Council
raised
his
hand
and
spoke
slowly
clear
cold
voice
Saruman
your
staff
broken
There
was
crack
and
the
staff
split
asunder
Saruman
hand
and
the
head
fell
down
Gandalf
feet
said
Gandalf
With
cry
Saruman
fell
back
and
crawled
away
that
moment
heavy
shining
thing
came
hurtling
down
from
above
glanced
off
the
iron
rail
even
Saruman
left
and
584
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
passing
close
Gandalf
head
smote
the
stair
which
stood
The
rail
rang
and
snapped
The
stair
cracked
and
splintered
glitter
ing
sparks
But
the
ball
was
unharmed
rolled
down
the
steps
globe
crystal
dark
but
glowing
with
heart
fire
bounded
away
towards
pool
Pippin
ran
after
and
picked
The
murderous
rogue
cried
Eomer
But
Gandalf
was
unmoved
that
was
not
thrown
Saruman
said
nor
even
his
bidding
think
came
from
window
far
above
parting
shot
from
Master
Wormtongue
fancy
but
ill
aimed
The
aim
was
poor
maybe
because
could
not
make
his
mind
which
hated
more
you
Saruman
said
Aragorn
That
may
said
Gandalf
Small
comfort
will
those
two
have
their
companionship
they
will
gnaw
one
another
with
words
But
the
punishment
just
Wormtongue
ever
comes
out
Orthanc
alive
will
more
than
deserves
Here
lad
Pll
take
that
did
not
ask
you
handle
cried
turning
sharply
and
seeing
Pippin
coming
the
steps
slowly
were
bearing
great
weight
went
down
meet
him
and
hastily
took
the
dark
globe
from
the
hobbit
wrapping
the
folds
his
cloak
will
take
care
this
said
not
thing
guess
that
Saruman
would
have
chosen
cast
away
But
may
have
other
things
cast
said
Gimli
that
the
end
the
debate
let
out
stone
throw
least
the
end
said
Gandalf
Let
They
turned
their
backs
the
doors
Orthanc
and
went
down
The
riders
hailed
the
king
with
joy
and
saluted
Gandalf
The
spell
Saruman
was
broken
they
had
seen
him
come
call
and
crawl
away
dismissed
Well
that
done
said
Gandalf
Now
must
find
Treebeard
and
tell
him
how
things
have
gone
will
have
guessed
surely
said
Merry
Were
they
likely
end
any
other
way
Not
likely
answered
Gandalf
though
they
came
the
balance
hair
But
had
reasons
for
trying
some
merciful
and
some
less
First
Saruman
was
shown
that
the
power
his
voice
was
waning
cannot
both
tyrant
and
counsellor
When
the
plot
ripe
remains
longer
secret
Yet
fell
into
the
trap
and
tried
deal
with
his
victims
piece
meal
while
others
listened
Then
gave
him
last
choice
and
fair
one
renounce
both
Mordor
and
his
private
schemes
and
make
amends
helping
our
need
knows
our
need
none
better
Great
service
could
have
rendered
But
has
chosen
withhold
and
keep
the

Orthanc

not

only

Mordor
and
yet
still
dreams

Unhappy
fool
will
devoured
the
power
the
East
stretches
out
its
arms
Isengard
cannot
destroy
Orthanc
from
without
but
Sauron
who
knows
what
can
And
what
Sauron
does
not
conquer
What
will
you
him
asked
Pippin
Nothing

Gandalf

nothing

not

What

that

that

Still
for
things
have
not
gone
badly
Strange
are
the
turns

Often
does
hatred
hurt
itself
guess
that
even
had

could
have
found

more
precious
than
the
thing
which
Wormtongue
threw
down
shrill
shriek
suddenly
cut
off
came
from
open
window
high
above
seems
that
Saruman
thinks
too
said
Gandalf
Let
leave
them
They
returned
now
the
ruins
the
gate
Hardly
had
they
passed
out
under
the
arch
when
from
among
the
shadows
the
piled
stones
where
they
had
stood
Treebeard
and
dozen
other
Ents
came
striding
Aragorn
Gimli
and
Legolas
gazed
them
wonder
Here
are
three
companions
Treebeard
said
Gandalf
have
spoken
them
but
you
have
not
yet
seen
them
named
them
one
one
The
Old
Ent
looked
them
long
and
searchingly
and
spoke
them

Last
turned
Legolas
you
have
come
all
the
way
from
Mirkwood
good
Elf
very
great
forest
used
And
still
said
Legolas
But
not
great
that
who
dwell
there
ever
tire
seeing
new
trees
should
dearly
love
journey
Fangorn
Wood
scarcely
passed
beyond
the
eaves
and
did
not
wish
turn
back
Treebeard
eyes
gleamed
with
pleasure
hope
you
may
have
your
wish
ere
the
hills
much
older
said
will
come
have
the
fortune
said
Legolas
have
made
bargain
with
friend
that
all
goes
well
will
visit
Fangorn
together
your
leave
Any
Elf
that
comes
with
you
will
welcome
said
Treebeard
The
friend

Elf

Legolas

Gimli
Gloin
son
here
Gimli
bowed
low
and
the
axe
slipped
from
his
belt
and
clattered
the
ground
Hoom
now
said
Treebeard
looking
dark
eyed
him
dwarf
and
axe
bearer
Hoom
have
good
will
Elves
but
you
ask
much
This
strange
friendship
586
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Strange
may
seem
said
Legolas
but
while
Gimli
lives
shall
not
come
Fangorn
alone
His
axe

for
trees
but
for
orc
necks
Fangorn
Master

Hoo
Come
now
said
Treebeard
That
better
story
Well
well
things
will
they
will
and
there
need
hurry
meet
them
But
now
must
part
for
while
Day
drawing
end
yet
Gandalf
says
you
must
ere
nightfall
and
the
Lord
the
Mark
eager
for
his
own
house
Yes
must
and
now
said
Gandalf
fear
that
must
take
your
gatekeepers
from
you
But
you
will
manage
well
enough
without
them
Maybe
shall
said
Treebeard
But
shall
miss
them
have
become
friends
short
while
that

getting
hasty

backwards
towards
youth
perhaps
But
there
they
are
the
first
new
thing
under
Sun
Moon
that
have

for
many
long
long
day
shall
not
forget
them

put
their
names
into
the
Long
List
Ents
will
remember
Ents
the
earthborn
old
mountains
the
wide
walkers
water
drinking
and
hungry
hunters
the
Hobbit
children
the
laughing
folk
the
little
people
they
shall
remain

long

Fare
you
well
But
you

your
pleasant
land
the
Shire
send
word
You
know
what
mean

the
Entwives
Come
yourselves
you
can

said
Merry
and
Pippin
together
and
they
turned
away
hastily
Treebeard
looked
them
and
was
silent
for
while
shaking
his
head
thoughtfully
Then
turned
Gandalf
Saruman
would
not
leave
said
did
not
think
would
His
heart
rotten
black
Huorn
Still
were
overcome
and
all
trees
destroyed
would
not
come
while
had
one
dark
hole
left
hide
said
Gandalf
But
you
have
not
plotted
cover
all
the
world
with
your
trees
and
choke
all
other
living
things
But
there
Saruman
remains
nurse
his
hatred
and
weave
again
such
webs
can
has
the
Key
Orthanc
But
must
not
allowed
escape
Indeed
Ents
will
see
that
said
Treebeard
Saruman
shall
not
set
foot
beyond
the
rock
without
leave
Ents
will
watch
over
him
Good
said
Gandalf
That
what
hoped
Now
can
and
THE
VOICE
SARUMAN
587
turn
other
matters
with
one
care
the
less
But
you
must
wary
The
waters
have
gone
down
will
not
enough
put
sentinels
round
the
tower
fear
not
doubt
that
there
were
deep
ways
delved
under
Orthanc
and
that
Saruman
hopes
and
come
unmarked
before
long
you
will
undertake
the
labour
beg
you
pour
the
waters
again
and
until
Isengard
remains
standing
pool
you
discover
the
outlets
When
all
the
underground
places
are
drowned
and
the
outlets
blocked
then
Saruman
must
stay
upstairs
and
look
out
the
windows
Leave
the
Ents
said
Treebeard
shall
search
the
valley
from
head

and
peer
under
every
pebble
Trees
are
coming
back
live
here
old
trees
wild
trees
The
Watchwood

call
Not
squirrel
will

Leave

Until
seven
times
the
years
which
tormented

Chapter
THE
PALANTIR
The
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
long
western
arm
the
mountains
when
Gandalf
and
his
companions
and
the
king
with
his
Riders
set
out
again
from
Isengard
Gandalf
took
Merry
behind
him
and
Ara
gorn
took
Pippin
Two
the
king
men
went
ahead
riding
swiftly
and
passed
soon
out
sight
down
into
the
valley
The
others
followed
easy
pace
Ents
solemn
row
stood
like
statues
the
gate
with
their
long
arms
uplifted
but
they
made
sound
Merry
and
Pippin
looked
back
when
they
had
passed
some
way
down
the
winding
road
Sunlight
was
still
shining
the
sky
but
long
shadows
reached
over
Isengard
grey
ruins
falling
into
darkness
Treebeard
stood
alone
there
now
like
the
distant
stump
old
tree
the
hobbits
thought
their
first
meeting
upon
the
sunny
ledge
far
away
the
borders
Fangorn
They
came
the
pillar
the
White
Hand
The
pillar
was
still
standing
but
the
graven
hand
had
been
thrown
down
and
broken
into
small
pieces
Right
the
middle
the
road
the
long
forefinger
lay
white
the
dusk
its
red
nail
darkening
black
The
Ents
pay
attention
every
detail
said
Gandalf
They
rode
and
evening
deepened
the
valley
Are
riding
far
tonight
Gandalf
asked
Merry
after
while
don
know
how
you
feel
with
small
rag
tag
dangling
behind
you
but
the
rag
tag
tired
and
will
glad
stop
dangling
and
lie
down
you
heard
that
said
Gandalf
Don
let
rankle
thankful
longer
words
were
aimed
you
had
his
eyes
you
any
comfort
your
pride
should
say
that
the
moment
you
and
Pippin
are
more
his
thoughts
than
all
the
rest
Who
you
are
how
you
came
there
and
why
what
you
know
whether
you
were
captured
and
how
you
escaped
when
all
the
Orcs
perished
with
those
little
riddles
that
the
great
mind
Saruman
troubled
sneer
from
him
Meriadoc
compliment
you
feel
honoured
his
concern
Thank
you
said
Merry
But
greater
honour
dangle
your
tail
Gandalf
For
one
thing
that
position
one
has
chance
putting
question
second
time
Are
riding
far

Gandalf
laughed

All
Wizards

them
the
meaning
the
word
and
correct
them
beg
your
pardon
But
have
THE
PALANTIR

even
these
simple
matters

ride
for
few
hours

until

Tomorrow

When

But

From

Nothing

you
wish
understand
what
happening
But
not
just
now
and
not
from
have
too
many
pressing
things
think
about
All
right
tackle
Strider
the
camp
fire
less
testy
But
why
all
this
secrecy
thought
won
the
battle
Yes
have
won
but
only
the
first
victory
and
that
itself
increases
our
danger
There
was
some
link
between
Isengard
and
Mordor
which
have
not
yet
fathomed
How
they
exchanged
news
not
sure
but
they
did
The
Eye
Barad
dtr
will
looking
impatiently
towards
the
Wizard
Vale
think
and
towards
Rohan
The
less
sees
the
better
The
road
passed
slowly
winding
down
the
valley
Now
further
and
now
nearer
Isen
flowed
its
stony
bed
Night
came
down
from
the
mountains
All
the
mists
were
gone
chill
wind
blew
The
moon
now
waxing
round
filled
the
eastern
sky
with
pale
cold
sheen
The
shoulders
the
mountain
their
right
sloped
down
bare
hills
The
wide
plains
opened
grey
before
them
last
they
halted
Then
they
turned
aside
leaving
the
highway
and
taking
the
sweet
upland
turf
again
Going
westward
mile
they
came
dale
opened
southward
leaning
back
into
the
slope
round
Dol
Baran
the
last
hill
the
northern
ranges
greenfooted
crowned
with
heather
The
sides
the
glen
were
shaggy
with
last
year
bracken
among
which
the
tight
curled
fronds
spring
were
just
thrusting
through
the
sweet
scented
earth
Thornbushes
grew
thick
upon
the
low
banks
and
under
them
they
made
their
camp
two
hours
before
the
middle
the
night
They
lit
fire
hollow
down
among
the
roots
spreading
hawthorn
tall
tree
writhen
with
age
but
hale
every
limb
Buds
were
swelling
each
twig
tip

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Guards
were
set
two
watch
The
rest
after
they
had
supped
wrapped
themselves
cloak
and
blanket
and
slept
The
hobbits
lay
corner
themselves
upon
pile
old
bracken
Merry
was
sleepy
but
Pippin
now
seemed
curiously
restless
The
bracken
cracked
and
rustled
twisted
and
turned
What
the
matter
asked
Merry
Are
you
lying
ant
hill
said
Pippin
but
not
comfortable
wonder
how
long
since
slept
bed
Merry
yawned
Work
out
your
fingers
said
But
you
must
know
how
long
since
left
Lorien
that
said
Pippin
mean
real
bed
bedroom
Well
Rivendell
then
said
Merry
But
could
sleep
anywhere
tonight
You
had
the
luck
Merry
said
Pippin
softly
after
pause
You
were
riding
with
Gandalf
Well
what
Did
you
get
any
news
any
information
out
him
Yes
good
deal
More
than
usual
But
you
heard
all
most
you
were
close
and
were
talking
secrets
But
you
can
with
him
tomorrow
you
think
you
can
get
more
out
him
and
have
you
Can
Good
But
close
isn
Not
changed
all
yes
said
Merry
waking
little
and
beginning
wonder
what
was
bothering
his
companion
has
grown
something
can
both
kinder
and
more
alarming
merrier
and
more
solemn
than
before
think
has
changed
but
have
not
had
chance
see
how
much
yet
But
think
the
last
part
that
business
with
Saruman
Remember
Saruman
was
once
Gandalf
superior
head
the
Council
whatever
that
may
exactly
was
Saruman
the
White
Gandalf
the
White
now
Saruman
came
when
was
told
and
his
rod
was
taken
and
then
was
just
told
and
went
Well
Gandalf
has
changed
all
then
closer
than
ever
that
all
Pippin
argued
That
glass
ball
now
seemed
mighty
pleased
with
knows
guesses
something
about
But
does
tell
what
not
word
Yet
picked
and
saved
from
rolling
into
pool
Here
take
that
lad
that
all
wonder
what
felt
very
heavy
Pippin
voice
fell
very
low
was
talking
himself
Hullo
said
Merry
that
what
bothering
you
Now
Pippin
lad
don
forget
Gildor
saying
the
one
Sam
used
quote
not
meddle
the
affairs
Wizards
for
they
are
subtle
and
quick
anger
But
our
whole
life
for
months
has
been
one
long
meddling
the
THE
PALANTIR
591
affairs
Wizards
said
Pippin
should
like
bit
information
well
danger
should
like
look
that
ball
sleep
said
Merry
You
get
information
enough
sooner
later
dear
Pippin
Took
ever
beat
Brandybuck
for
inquisi
tiveness
but
this
the
time
ask
you
All
right
What
the
harm
telling
you
what
should
like
look
that
stone
know
can
have
with
old
Gandalf
sitting
like
hen
egg
But
doesn
help
much
get
more
from
you
than
you
can
have
sleep
Well
what
else
could
say
said
Merry
sorry
Pippin
but
you
really
must
wait
till
the
morning
Ill
curious
you
like
after
breakfast
and
Ill
help
any
way
can
wizard
wheedling
But
can
keep
awake
any
longer
yawn
any
more
shall
split
the
ears
Good
night
Pippin
said
more
lay
still
now
but
sleep
remained
far
away
and
was
not
encouraged
the
sound
Merry
breathing
softly
asleep
few
minutes
after
saying
good
night
The
thought
the
dark
globe
seemed
grow
stronger
all
grew
quiet
Pippin
felt
again
its
weight
his
hands
and
saw
again
the
mysterious
red
depths
into
which
had
looked
for
moment
tossed
and
turned
and
tried
think
something
else
last
could
stand
longer
got
and
looked
round
was
chilly
and
wrapped
his
cloak
about
him
The
moon
was
shining
cold
and
white
down
into
the
dell
and
the
shadows
the
bushes
were
black
All
about
lay
sleeping
shapes
The
two
guards
were
not
view
they
were
the
hill
perhaps
hidden
the
bracken
Driven
some
impulse
that
did
not
understand
Pippin
walked
softly
where
Gandalf
lay
looked
down
him
The
wizard
seemed
asleep
but
with
lids
not
fully
closed
there
was
glitter
eyes
under
his
long
lashes
Pippin
stepped
back
hastily
But
Gandalf
made
sign
and
drawn
forward
once
more
half
against
his
will
the
hobbit
crept
again
from
behind
the
wizard
head
was
rolled
blanket
with
his
cloak
spread
over
the
top
and
close
beside
him
between
his
right
side
and
his
bent
arm
there
was
hummock
something
round
wrapped
dark
cloth
his
hand
seemed
only
just
have
slipped
off
the
ground
Hardly
breathing
Pippin
crept
nearer
foot
foot
last
knelt
down
Then
put
his
hands
out
stealthily
and
slowly
lifted
the
lump
did
not
seem
quite
heavy
had
expected
Only
some
bundle
oddments
perhaps
after
all
thought
with
strange
sense
relief
but
did
not
put
the
bundle
down
again
stood
for
moment
clasping
Then
idea
came
into
his
mind
tiptoed
away
found
large
stone
and
came
back
592
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Quickly
now
drew
off
the
cloth
wrapped
the
stone
and
kneeling
down
laid
back
the
wizard
hand
Then
last
looked
the
thing
that
had
uncovered
There
was
smooth
globe
crystal
now
dark
and
dead
lying
bare
before
his
knees
Pippin
lifted
covered
hurriedly
his
own
cloak
and
half
turned
back
his
bed
that
moment
Gandalf
moved
his
sleep
and
muttered
some
words
they
seemed
strange
tongue
his
hand
groped
out
and
clasped
the
wrapped
stone
then
sighed
and
did
not
move
again
You
idiotic
fool
Pippin
muttered
himself
You
going
get
yourself
into
frightful
trouble
Put
back
quick
But
found
now
that
his
knees
quaked
and
did
not
dare
near
enough
the
wizard
reach
the
bundle
never
get
back
now
without
waking
him
thought
not
till
bit
calmer
may
well
have
look
first
Not
just
here
though
stole
away
and
sat
down
green
hillock
not
far
from
his
bed
The
moon
looked
over
the
edge
the
dell
Pippin
sat
with
his
knees
drawn
and
the
ball
between
them
bent
low
over
looking
like
greedy
child
stooping
over
bowl
food
corner
away
from
others
drew
his
cloak
aside
and
gazed
The
air
seemed
still
and
tense
about
him
first
the
globe
was
dark
black
jet
with
the
moonlight
gleaming
its
surface
Then
there
came
faint
glow
and
stir
the
heart
and
held
his
eyes
that
now
could
not
look
away
Soon
all
the
inside
seemed
fire
the
ball
was
spinning
the
lights
within
were
revolving
Suddenly
the
lights
went
out
gave
gasp
and
struggled
but
remained
bent
clasping
the
ball
with
both
hands
Closer
and
closer
bent
and
then
became
rigid
his
lips
moved
soundlessly
for
while
Then
with
strangled
cry
fell
back
and
lay
still
The
cry
was
piercing
The
guards
leapt
down
from
the
banks
All
the
camp
was
soon
astir
this
the
thief
said
Gandalf
Hastily
cast
his
cloak
over
the
globe
where
lay
But
you
Pippin
This
grievous
turn
things
knelt
Pippin
body
the
hobbit
was
lying
his
back
rigid
with
unseeing
eyes
staring
the
sky
The
devilry
What
mischief
has
done
himself
and
all
The
wizard
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
took
Pippin
hand
and
bent
over
his
face
listening
for
his
breath
then
laid
his
hands
his
brow
The
hobbit
shuddered
His
eyes
closed
cried
out
and
sat
staring
bewilderment
all
the
faces
round
him
pale
the
moonlight
not
for
you
Saruman
cried
shrill
and
toneless
voice
shrinking
away
from
Gandalf
will
send
for
once
you
THE
PALANTIR
593
understand
Say
just
that
Then
struggled
get
and
escape
but
Gandalf
held
him
gently
and
firmly
Peregrin
Took
said
Come
back
The
hobbit
relaxed
and
fell
back
clinging
the
wizard
hand
Gandalf
cried
Gandalf
Forgive
Forgive
your
said
the
wizard
Tell
first
what
you
have
done
took
the
ball
and
looked
stammered
Pippin
and
saw
things
that
frightened
And
wanted
away
but
couldn
And
then
came
and
questioned
and
looked
and
and
that
all
remember
That
won
said
Gandalf
sternly
What
did
you
see
and
what
did
you
say
Pippin
shut
his
eyes
and
shivered
but
said
nothing
They
all
stared
him
silence
except
Merry
who
turned
away
But
Gandalf
face
was
still
hard
Speak
said
low
hesitating
voice
Pippin
began
again
and
slowly
his
words
grew
clearer
and
stronger
saw
dark
sky
and
tall
battlements
said
And
tiny
stars
seemed
very
far
away
and
long
ago
yet
hard
and
clear
Then
the
stars
went
and
out
they
were
cut
off
things
with
wings
Very
big
think
really
but
the
glass
they
looked
like
bats
wheeling
round
the
tower
thought
there
were
nine
them
One
began
fly
straight
towards
getting
bigger
and
bigger
had
horrible
can
say
tried
get
away
because
thought
would
fly
out
but
when
had
covered
all
the
globe
disappeared
Then
came
did
not
speak
that
could
hear
words
just
looked
and
understood
you
have
come
back
Why
have
you
neglected
report
for
long
did
not
answer
said
Who
are
you
still
did
not
answer
but
hurt
horribly
and
pressed
said
hobbit
Then
suddenly
seemed
see
and
laughed
was
cruel
was
like
being
stabbed
with
knives
struggled
But
said
Wait
moment
shall
meet
again
soon
Tell
Saruman
that
this
dainty
not
for
him
will
send
for
once
you
understand
Say
just
that
Then
gloated
over
felt
was
falling
pieces
can
say
any
more
don
remember
anything
else
Look
said
Gandalf
Pippin
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
The
wizard
held
his
gaze
for
moment
silence
Then
his
face
grew
gentler
and
the
shadow
smile
appeared
laid
his
hand
softly
Pippin
head
All
right
said
Say
more
You
have
taken
harm
There
lie
your
eyes
feared
But
did
not
speak
long
with
you
fool
but
honest
fool
you
remain
Peregrin
Took
Wiser
594
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
ones
might
have
done
worse
such
pass
But
mark
this
You
have
been
saved
and
all
your
friends
too
mainly
good
fortune
called
You
cannot
count
second
time
had
questioned
you
then
and
there
almost
certainly
you
would
have
told
all
that
you
know
the
ruin
all
But
was
too
eager
did
not
want
information
only
wanted
you
quickly
that
could
deal
with
you
the
Dark
Tower
slowly
Don
shudder
you
will
meddle
the
affairs
Wizards
you
must
prepared
think
such
things
But
come
forgive
you
comforted
Things
have
not
turned
out
evilly
they
might
lifted
Pippin
gently
and
carried
him
back
his
bed
Merry
followed
and
sat
down
beside
him
Lie
there
and
rest
you
can
Pippin
said
Gandalf
Trust
you
feel
itch
your
palms
again
tell
Such
things
can
cured
But
anyway
dear
hobbit
don
put
lump
rock
under
elbow
again
Now
will
leave
you
two
together
for
while
With
that
Gandalf
returned
the
others
who
were
still
standing
the
Orthanc
stone
troubled
thought
Peril
comes
the
night
when
least
expected
said
have
had
narrow
escape
How
the
hobbit
Pippin
asked
Aragorn
think
all
will
well
now
answered
Gandalf
was
not
held
long
and
hobbits
have
amazing
power
recovery
The
memory
the
horror
will
probably
fade
quickly
Too
quickly
perhaps
Will
you
Aragorn
take
the
Orthanc
stone
and
guard
danger
ous
charge
Dangerous
indeed
but
not
all
said
Aragorn
There
one
who
may
claim
right
For
this
assuredly
the
palantir
Orthanc
from
the
treasury
Elendil
set
here
the
Kings
Gondor
Now
hour
draws
near
will
take
Gandalf
looked
Aragorn
and
then
the
surprise
the
others
lifted
the
covered
Stone
and
bowed
presented
Receive
lord
said
earnest
other
things
that
shall
given
back
But
may
counsel
you
the
use
your
own
not
use
yet
wary
When
have
been
hasty
unwary
who
have
waited
and
prepared
for
many
long
years
said
Aragorn
Never
yet
not
then
stumble
the
end
the
road
answered
Gandalf
But
the
least
keep
this
thing
secret
You
and
all
others
that
stand
here
The
hobbit
Peregrin
above
all
should
not
know
where
bestowed
The
evil
fit
may
come
him
again
For
alas
has
handled
and
looked
should
never
have
happened
ought
never
have
touched
Isengard
and
there
should
have
been
quicker
But
mind
was
bent
Saruman
and
did
THE
PALANTIR
595
not
once
guess
the
nature
the
Stone
Then
was
weary
and
lay
pondering
sleep
overcame
Now
know
Yes
there
can
doubt
said
Aragorn
last
know
the
link
between
Isengard
and
Mordor
and
how
worked
Much
explained
Strange
powers
have
our
enemies
and
strange
weaknesses
said
Théoden
But
has
long
been
said
oft
evil
will
shall
evil
mar
That
many
times
seen
said
Gandalf
But
this
time
have
been
strangely
fortunate
Maybe
have
been
saved
this
hobbit
from
grave
blunder
had
considered
whether
not
probe
this
Stone
myself
find
its
uses
Had
done
should
have
been
revealed
him
myself
not
ready
for
such
trial
indeed
shall
ever
But
even
found
the
power
withdraw
myself
would
disastrous
for
him
see
yet
until
the
hour
comes
when
secrecy
will
avail
longer
That
hour
now
come
think
said
Aragorn
Not
yet
said
Gandalf
There
remains
short
while
doubt
which
must
use
The
Enemy
clear
thought
that
the
Stone
was
Orthanc
why
should
not
And
that
therefore
the
hobbit
was
captive
there
driven
look
the
glass
for
his
torment
Saruman
That
dark
mind
will
filled
now
with
the
voice
and
face
the
hobbit
and
with
expectation
may
take
some
time
before
learns
his
error
must
snatch
that
time
have
been
too
leisurely
must
move
The
neighbourhood
Isengard
place
now
linger
will
ride
ahead
once
with
Peregrin
Took
will
better
for
him
than
lying
the
dark
while
others
sleep
will
keep
Eomer
and
ten
Riders
said
the
king
They
shall
ride
with
early
day
The
rest
may
with
Aragorn
and
ride
soon
they
have
mind
you
will
said
Gandalf
But
make
all
the
speed
you
may
the
cover
the
hills
Helm
Deep
that
moment
shadow
fell
over
them
The
bright
moonlight
seemed
suddenly
cut
off
Several
the
Riders
cried
out
and
crouched
holding
their
arms
above
their
heads
ward
off
blow
from
above
blind
fear
and
deadly
cold
fell
them
Cowering
they
looked
vast
winged
shape
passed
over
the
moon
like
black
cloud
wheeled
and
went
north
flying
speed
greater
than
any
wind
Middle
earth
The
stars
fainted
before
was
gone
They
stood
rigid
stones
Gandalf
was
gazing
his
arms
out
and
downwards
stiff
his
hands
clenched
Nazgul
cried
The
messenger
Mordor
The
storm
coming
The
Nazgul
have
crossed
the
River
Ride
ride
Wait
not
for
the
dawn
Let
not
the
swift
wait
for
the
slow
Ride
596
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
sprang
away
calling
Shadowfax
ran
Aragorn
followed
him
Going
Pippin
Gandalf
picked
him
his
arms
You
shall
come
with
this
time
said
Shadowfax
shall
show
you
his
paces
Then
ran
the
place
where
had
slept
Shadowfax
stood
there
already
Slinging
the
small
bag
which
was
all
his
luggage
across
his

the

leapt
upon

Aragorn

him
Gandalf
arms
wrapped
cloak
and
blanket
Farewell
Follow
fast
cried
Gandalf
Away
Shadowfax
The
great
horse
tossed
his
head
His
flowing
tail
flicked
the
moonlight
Then
leapt
forward
spurning
the
earth
and
was
gone
like
the
north
wind
from
the
mountains
beautiful
restful
night
said
Merry
Aragorn
Some
folk
have
wonderful
luck
did
not
want
sleep
and
wanted
ride
with
Gandalf
and
there
goes
Instead
being
turned
into
stone
himself
stand
here
for
ever
warning
you
had
been
the
first
lift
the
Orthanc
stone
and
not
how
would
now
said
Aragorn
You
might
have
done
worse
Who
can
say
But
now
your
luck
come
with
fear
once
and
get
ready
and
bring
anything
that
Pippin
left
behind
Make
haste
Over
the
plains
Shadowfax
was
flying
needing
urging
and
guidance
Less
than
hour
had
passed
and
they
had
reached
the
Fords
Isen
and
crossed
them
The
Mound
the
Riders
and
its
cold
spears
lay
grey
behind
them
Pippin
was
recovering
was
warm
but
the
wind
his
face
was
keen
and
refreshing
was
with
Gandalf
The
horror
the
Stone
and
the
hideous
shadow
over
the
moon
was
fading
things
left
behind
the
mists
the
mountains
passing
dream
drew
deep
breath
did
not
know
you
rode
bare
back
Gandalf
said
You
haven
saddle
bridle
not
ride
elf
fashion
except
Shadowfax
said
Gandalf
But
Shadowfax
will
have
harness
You
not
ride
Shadowfax
willing
carry
you
not
willing
that
enough
then
his
business
see
that
you
remain
his
back
unless
you
jump
off
into
the
air
How
fast
going
asked
Pippin
Fast
the
wind
but
very
smooth
And
how
light
his
footfalls
are
running
now
fast
the
swiftest
horse
could
gallop
answered
Gandalf
but
that
not
fast
for
him
The
land
rising
little
here
and
more
broken
than
was
beyond
the
river
But
see
how
the
White
Mountains
are
drawing
near
under
the
stars
Yonder
THE
PALANTIR
597
are
the
Thrihyrne
peaks
like
black
spears
will
not
long
before
reach
the
branching
roads
and
come
the
Deeping
coomb
where
the
battle
was
fought
two
nights
ago
Pippin
was
silent
again
for
while
heard
Gandalf
singing
softly
himself
murmuring
brief
snatches
rhyme
many
tongues
the
miles
ran
under
them
last
the
wizard
passed
into
song
which
the
hobbit
caught
the
words
few
lines
came
clear
his
ears
through
the
rushing
the
wind
Tall
ships
and
tall
kings
Three
times
three
What
brought
they
from
the
foundered
land
Over
the
flowing
sea
Seven
stars
and
seven
stones
And
one
white
tree
What
are
you
saying
Gandalf
asked
Pippin
was
just
running
over
some
the
Rhymes
Lore
mind
answered
the
wizard
Hobbits
suppose
have
forgotten
them
even
those
that
they
ever
knew
not
all
said
Pippin
And
have
many
our
own
which
wouldn
interest
you
perhaps
But
have
never
heard
this
one
What
about
the
seven
stars
and
seven
stones
About
the
palantiri
the
Kings
Old
said
Gandalf
And
what
are
they
The
name
meant
that
which
looks
far
away
The
Orthanc
stone
was
one
Then
was
not
made
not
made
Pippin
hesitated
the
Enemy
said
Gandalf
Nor
Saruman
beyond
his
art
and
beyond
Sauron
too
The
palantiri
came
from
beyond
Westernesse
from
Eldamar
The
Noldor
made
them
Féanor
himself
maybe
wrought
them
days
long
ago
that
the
time
cannot
measured
years
But
there
nothing
that
Sauron
cannot
turn
evil
uses
Alas
for
Saruman
was
his
downfall
now
perceive
Perilous
all
are
the
devices
art
deeper
than
possess
ourselves
Yet
must
bear
the
blame
Fool
keep
secret
for
his
own
profit
word
did
ever
speak
any
the
Council
had
not
yet
given
thought
the
fate
the
palantiri
Gondor
its
ruinous
wars
Men
they
were
almost
forgotten
Even
Gondor
they
were
secret
known
only
few
Arnor
they
were
remembered
only
rhyme
lore
among
the
Dunedain
What
did
the
Men
old
use
them
for
asked
Pippin
delighted
598
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
and
astonished
getting
answers
many
questions
and
wonder
ing
how
long
would
last
see
far
off
and
converse
thought
with
one
another
said
Gandalf
that
way
they
long
guarded
and
united
the
realm
Gondor
They
set
Stones
Minas
Anor
and
Minas
Ithil
and
Orthanc
the
ring
Isengard
The
chief
and
master
these
was
under
the
Dome
Stars
Osgiliath
before
its
ruin
The
three
others
were
far
away
the
North
the
house
Elrond
told
that
they
were
Annuminas
and
Amon
Sil
and
Elendil
Stone
was
the
Tower
Hills
that
look
towards
Mithlond
the
Gulf
Lune
where
the
grey
ships
lie
Each
palantir
replied
each
but
all
those
Gondor
were
ever
open
the
view
Osgiliath
Now
appears
that
the
rock
Orthanc
has
withstood
the
storms
time
there
the
palantir
that
tower
has
remained
But
alone
could
nothing
but
see
small
images
things
far
off
and
days
remote
Very
useful
doubt
that
was
Saruman
yet
seems
that
was
not
content
Further
and
further
abroad
gazed
until
cast
his
gaze
upon
Barad
dtr
Then
was
caught
Who
knows
where
the
lost
Stones
Arnor
and
Gondor
now
lie
buried
drowned
deep
But
one
least
Sauron
must
have
obtained
and
mastered
his
purposes
guess
that
was
the
Ithil
stone
for
took
Minas
Ithil
long
ago
and
turned
into
evil
place
Minas
Morgul
has
become
Easy
now
guess
how
quickly
the
roving
eye
Saruman
was
trapped
and
held
and
how
ever
since
has
been
persuaded
from
afar
and
daunted
when
persuasion
would
not
serve
The
biter
bit
the
hawk
under
the
eagle
foot
the
spider
steel
web
How
long
wonder
has
been
constrained
come
often
his
glass
for
inspection
and
instruction
and
the
Orthanc
stone
bent
towards
Barad
dur
that
any
save
will
adamant
now
looks
into
will
bear
his
mind
and
sight
swiftly
thither
And
how
draws
one
itself
Have
not
felt
Even
now
heart
desires
test
will
upon
see
could
not
wrench
from
him
and
turn
where
would
look
across
the
wide
seas
water
and
time
Tirion
the
Fair
and
perceive
the
unimaginable
hand
and
mind
Féanor
their
work
while
both
the
White
Tree
and
the
Golden
were
flower
sighed
and
fell
silent
wish
had
known
all
this
before
said
Pippin
had
notion
what
was
doing
yes
you
had
said
Gandalf
You
knew
you
were
behaving
wrongly
and
foolishly
and
you
told
yourself
though
you
did
not
listen
did
not
tell
you
all
this
before
because
only
musing
all
that
has
happened
that
have
last
understood
even
THE
PALANTIR
599
ride
together
But
had
spoken
sooner
would
not
have
lessened
your
desire
made
easier
resist
the
contrary
the
burned
hand
teaches
best
After
that
advice
about
fire
goes
the
heart
does
said
Pippin
all
the
seven
stones
were
laid
out
before
now
should
shut
eyes
and
put
hands
pockets
Good
said
Gandalf
That
what
hoped
But
should
like
know
Pippin
began
Mercy
cried
Gandalf
the
giving
information
the
cure
your
inquisitiveness
shall
spend
all
the
rest
days
answering
you
What
more
you
want
know
The
names
all
the
stars
and
all
living
things
and
the
whole
history
Middle
earth
and
Over
heaven
and
the
Sundering
Seas
laughed
Pippin
course
What
less
But
not
hurry
tonight
the
moment
was
just
wondering
about
the
black
shadow
heard
you
shout
messenger
Mordor
What
was
What
could
Isengard
was
Black
Rider
wings
Nazgil
said
Gandalf
could
have
taken
you
away
the
Dark
Tower
But
was
not
coming
for
was
faltered
Pippin
mean
didn
know
that
had
course
not
said
Gandalf
two
hundred
leagues
more
straight
flight
from
Barad
dar
Orthanc
and
even
Nazgtl
would
take
few
hours
fly
between
them
But
Saruman
certainly
looked
the
Stone
since
the
orc
raid
and
more
his
secret
thought
not
doubt
has
been
read
than
intended
messenger
has
been
sent
find
out
what
doing
And
after
what
has
happened
tonight
another
will
come
think
and
swiftly
Saruman
will
come
the
last
pinch
the
vice
that
has
put
his
hand
has
captive
send
has
Stone
see
with
and
cannot
answer
the
summons
Sauron
will
only
believe
that
withholding
the
captive
and
refusing
use
the
Stone
will
not
help
Saruman
tell
the
truth
the
messenger
For
Isengard
may
ruined
yet
still
safe
Orthanc
whether
will
will
appear
rebel
Yet
rejected
avoid
that
very
thing
What
will
such
plight
cannot
guess
has
power
still
think
while
Orthanc
resist
the
Nine
Riders
may
try
may
try
trap
the
Nazgul
least
slay
the
thing
which
now
rides
the
air
that
case
let
Rohan
look
its
horses
But
cannot
tell
how
will
fall
out
well
ill
for
may
that
the
counsels
the
Enemy
will
confused
hindered
his
wrath
with
Saruman
may
that
will
learn
that
was
there
and
stood
upon
the
stairs
Orthanc
with
hobbits

THE

the

Every

Pippin
made
answer
but
clutched
his
cloak
sudden
chill
had
struck
him
Grey

passed
under

See
now
said
Gandalf
The
Westfold

Here
come
back
the

The

yonder
the

the

That

lies
Aglarond

the
Glittering

Ask

you

for
the
first

you
may
get

than
you

You

Soon

Pippin
Where

And
how
far

Leagues

answered
Gandalf
Thrice
far
the

they
are

Which

Then

You

Away

Now

Shadowfax
tossed

and
cried
aloud

Then
sprang
forward
Fire

from

BOOK

Chapter
THE
TAMING
SMEAGOL
Well
master
fix
and
mistake
said
Sam
Gamgee
stood
despondently
with
hunched
shoulders
beside
Frodo
and
peered
out
with
puckered
eyes
into
the
gloom
was
the
third
evening
since
they
had
fled
from
the
Company
far
they
could
tell
they
had
almost
lost
count
the
hours
during
which
they
had
climbed
and
laboured
among
the
barren
slopes
and
stones
the
Emyn
Muil
sometimes
retracing
their
steps
because
they
could
find
way
forward
sometimes
discovering
that
they
had
wandered
circle
back
where
they
had
been
hours
before
Yet
the
whole
they
had
worked
steadily
eastward
keeping
near
they
could
find
way
the
outer
edge
this
strange
twisted
knot
hills
But
always
they
found
its
outward
faces
sheer
high
and
impassable
frowning
over
the
plain
below
beyond
its
tumbled
skirts
lay
livid
festering
marshes
where
nothing
moved
and
not
even
bird
was
seen
The
hobbits
stood
now
the
brink
tall
cliff
bare
and
bleak
its
feet
wrapped
mist
and
behind
them
rose
the
broken
highlands
crowned
with
drifting
cloud
chill
wind
blew
from
the
East
Night
was
gathering
over
the
shapeless
lands
before
them
the
sickly
green
them
was
fading
sullen
brown
Far
away
the
right
the
Anduin
that
had
gleamed
fitfully
sun
breaks
during
the
day
was
now
hidden
shadow
But
their
eyes
did
not
look
beyond
the
River
back
Gondor
their
friends
the
lands
Men
South
and
east
they
stared
where
the
edge
the
oncoming
night
dark
line
hung
like
distant
mountains
motionless
smoke
Every
now
and
again
tiny
red
gleam
far
away
flickered
upwards
the
rim
earth
and
sky
What
fix
said
Sam
That
the
one
place
all
the
lands
ever
heard
that
don
want
see
any
closer
and
that
the
one
place
trying
get
And
that
just
where
can
get
nohow
come
the
wrong
way
altogether
seemingly
can
get
down
and
did
get
down
find
all
that
green
land
nasty
bog
Ill
warrant
Phew
Can
you
smell
sniffed
the
wind
Yes
can
smell
said
Frodo
but
did
not
move
and
his
eyes
remained
fixed
staring
out
towards
the
dark
line
and
the
flicker
ing
flame
Mordor
muttered
under
his
breath

The

with
odour

Well

withdrawing
his

here

find

Shadow
yonder

But

What
hope
had
was

Delay

into
the
Enemy
hands
and
here
delayed
the
will
the
Dark
Tower
that
steers
All
choices
have
proved
ill
should
have
left
the
Company
long
before
and
come
down
from
the
North
east
the
River
and
the
Emyn
Muil
and
over
the
hard
Battle
Plain
the
passes
Mordor
But
now
isn
possible
for
you
and
alone
find
way
back
and
the
Orcs
are
prowling
the
east
bank
Every
day
that
passes
precious
day
lost
tired
Sam
don
know
what
done
What
food
have
got
left
Only
those
what
you
call
lembas
Frodo
fair
supply
But
they
are
better
than
naught
long
bite
never
thought
though
when
first
set
tooth
them
that
should
ever
come
wish
for

But
now
bit
plain
bread
and
mug
aye
half
mug
beer
would
down
proper
lugged

from
the
last

and
what
use
has
been
Naught
make
fire
with
for
start
and
naught
cook
not
even
grass
They
turned
away
and
went
down
into
stony
hollow
The
wester
ing
sun
was
caught
into
clouds
and
night
came
swiftly
They
slept
well
they
could
for
the
cold
turn
and
turn
about
nook
among
great
jagged
pinnacles
weathered
rock
least
they
were
sheltered
from
the
easterly
wind
Did
you
see
them
again
Frodo
asked
Sam
they
sat
stiff
and
chilled
munching
wafers
Jembas
the
cold
grey
early
morning
said
Frodo
heard
nothing
and
seen
nothing
for
two
nights
now
Nor
said
Sam
Grrr
Those
eyes
did

But
perhaps
shaken

Gollum
Pll

said
Frodo
don
know
how
followed
but
may

can
leave

hope
that
the
way
said
Sam
wish
could
rid
him
for

said
Frodo
but
not
chief
trouble
wish
could
get
away
from
these
hills
hate
them
feel
all

stuck
here
with

but
the
dead

Shadow

There
Eye
Come

get
down
today
somehow
But
that
day
wore
and
when
afternoon
faded
towards
evening
they
were
still
scrambling
along
the
ridge
and
had
found
way
escape
Sometimes
the
silence
that
barren
country
they
fancied
that
they
heard
faint
sounds
behind
them
stone
falling
the
imagined
step
flapping
feet
the
rock
But
they
halted
and
stood
still
listening
they
heard
more
nothing
but
the
wind
sighing
over
the
edges
the
stones
yet
even
that
reminded
them
breath
softly
hissing
through
sharp
teeth
All
that
day
the
outer
ridge
the
Emyn
Muil
had
been
bending
gradually
northward
they
struggled
Along
its
brink
there
now
stretched
wide
tumbled
flat
scored
and
weathered
rock
cut
every
now
and
again
trench
like
gullies
that
sloped
steeply
down
deep
notches
the
cliff
face
find
path
these
clefts
which
were
becoming
deeper
and
more
frequent
Frodo
and
Sam
were
driven
their
left
well
away
from
the
edge
and
they
did
not
notice
that
for
several
miles
they
had
been
going
slowly
but
steadily
downhill
the
cliff
top
was
sinking
towards
the
level
the
lowlands
last
they
were
brought
halt
The
ridge
took
sharper
bend
northward
and
was
gashed
deeper
ravine
the
further
side
reared
again
many
fathoms
single
leap
great
grey
cliff
loomed
before
them
cut
sheer
down
knife
stroke
They
could
further
forwards
and
must
turn
now
either
west
east
But
west
would
lead
them
only
into
more
labour
and
delay
back
towards
the
heart
the
hills
east
would
take
them
the
outer
precipice
There
nothing
for
but
scramble
down
this
gully
Sam
said
Frodo
Let
see
what
leads
nasty
drop
Pll
bet
said
Sam
The
cleft
was
longer
and
deeper
than
seemed
Some
way
down
they
found
few
gnarled
and
stunted
trees
the
first
they
had
seen
for
days
twisted
birch
for
the
most
part
with
here
and
there
fir
tree
Many
were
dead
and
gaunt
bitten
the
core
the
eastern
winds
Once
milder
days
there
must
have
been
fair
thicket
the
ravine
but
now
after
some
fifty
yards
the
trees
came
end
though
old
broken
stumps
straggled
almost
the
cliff
brink
The
bottom
606
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
the
gully
which
lay
along
the
edge
rock
fault
was
rough
with
broken
stone
and
slanted
steeply
down
When
they
came
last
the
end
Frodo
stooped
and
leaned
out
Look
said
must
have
come
down
long
way
else
the
cliff
has
sunk
much
lower
here
than
was
and
looks
easier
too
Sam
knelt
beside
him
and
peered
reluctantly
over
the
edge
Then
glanced
the
great
cliff
rising
away
their
left
Easier
grunted
Well
suppose
always
easier
getting
down
than
Those
can
fly
can
jump
would
big
jump
still
said
Frodo
About
well
stood
for
moment
measuring
with
his
eyes
about
eighteen
fathoms
should
guess
Not
more
And
that
enough
said
Sam
Ugh
How
hate
looking
down
from
height
But
looking
better
than
climbing
All
the
same
said
Frodo
think
could
climb
here
and
think
shall
have
try
See
the
rock
quite
different
from
what
was
few
miles
back
has
slipped
and
cracked
The
outer
fall
was
indeed
longer
sheer
but
sloped
outwards
little
looked
like
great
rampart
sea
wall
whose
foundations
had
shifted
that
its
courses
were
all
twisted
and
disordered
leaving
great
fissures
and
long
slanting
edges
that
were
places
almost
wide
stairs
And
going
try
and
get
down
had
better
try
once
getting
dark
early
think
there
storm
coming
The
smoky
blur
the
mountains
the
East
was
lost
deeper
blackness
that
was
already
reaching
out
westwards
with
long
arms
There
was
distant
mutter
thunder
borne
the
rising
breeze
Frodo
sniffed
the
air
and
looked
doubtfully
the
sky
strapped
his
belt
outside
his
cloak
and
tightened
and
settled
his
light
pack
his
back
then
stepped
towards
the
edge
going
try
said
Very
good
said
Sam
gloomily
But
going
first
Your
said
Frodo
What
made
you
change
your
mind
about
climbing
haven
changed
mind
But
only
sense
put
the
one
lowest
most
likely
slip
don
want
come
down
atop
you
and
knock
you
off
sense
killing
two
with
one
fall
Before
Frodo
could
stop
him
sat
down
swung
his
legs
over
the
brink
and
twisted
round
scrabbling
with
his
toes
for
foothold
doubtful
ever
did
anything
braver
cold
blood
more
unwise
Sam
you
old
ass
said
Frodo
You
kill
yourself
for
certain
going
over
like
that
without
even
look
see
what
make
THE
TAMING
SMEAGOL
607
for
Come
back
took
Sam
under
the
armpits
and
hauled
him
again
Now
wait
bit
and
patient
said
Then
lay
the
ground
leaning
out
and
looking
down
but
the
light
seemed
fading
quickly
although
the
sun
had
not
yet
set
think
could
manage
this
said
presently
could
any
rate
and
you
could
too
you
kept
your
head
and
followed
carefully
don
know
how
you
can
sure
said
Sam
Why
You
can
see
the
bottom
this
light
What
you
comes
place
where
there
nowhere
put
your
feet
your
hands
Climb
back
suppose
said
Frodo
Easy
said
objected
Sam
Better
wait
till
morning
and
more
light
Not
can
help
said
Frodo
with
sudden
strange
vehe
mence
grudge
every
hour
every
minute
going
down
try
out
Don
you
follow
till
come
back
call
Gripping
the
stony
lip
the
fall
with
his
fingers
let
himself
gently
down
until
when
his
arms
were
almost
full
stretch
his
toes
found
ledge
One
step
down
said
And
this
ledge
broadens
out
the
right
could
stand
there
without
hold
his
words
were
cut
short
The
hurrying
darkness
now
gathering
great
speed
rushed
from
the
East
and
swallowed
the
sky
There
was
dry
splitting
crack
thunder
right
overhead
Searing
lightning
smote
down
into
the
hills
Then
came
blast
savage
wind
and
with
mingling
with
its
roar
there
came
high
shrill
shriek
The
hobbits
had
heard
just
such
cry
far
away
the
Marish
they
fled
from
Hobbiton
and
even
there
the
woods
the
Shire
had
frozen
their
blood
Out
here
the
waste
its
terror
was
far
greater
pierced
them
with
cold
blades
horror
and
despair
stopping
heart
and
breath
Sam
fell
flat
his
face
Involuntarily
Frodo
loosed
his
hold
and
put
his
hands
over
his
head
and
ears
swayed
slipped
and
slithered
downwards
with
wailing
cry
Sam
heard
him
and
crawled
with
effort
the
edge
Master
master
called
Master
heard
answer
found
was
shaking
all
over
but
gathered
his
breath
and
once
again
shouted
Master
The
wind
seemed
blow
his
voice
back
into
his
throat
but
passed
roaring
the
gully
and
away
over
the
hills
faint
answering
cry
came
his
ears
All
right
all
right
here
But
can
see
Frodo
was
calling
with
weak
voice
was
not
actually
very
far
away
had
slid
and
not
fallen
and
had
come
with
jolt
his
feet
wider
ledge
not
many
yards
lower
down
Fortunately
the
rock
face
this
point
leaned
well
back
and
the
wind
had
pressed
608
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
him
against
the
cliff
that
had
not
toppled
over
steadied
himself
little
laying
his
face
against
the
cold
stone
feeling
his
heart
pounding
But
either
the
darkness
had
grown
complete
else
his
eyes
had
lost
their
sight
All
was
black
about
him
wondered
had
been
struck
blind
took
deep
breath
Come
back
Come
back
heard
Sam
voice
out
the
black
ness
above
can
said
can
see
can
find
any
hold
can
move
yet
What
can
Frodo
What
can
shouted
Sam
leaning
out
dangerously
far
Why
could
not
his
master
see
was
dim
certainly
but
not
dark
all
that
could
see
Frodo
below
him
grey
forlorn
figure
splayed
against
the
cliff
But
was
far
out
the
reach
any
helping
hand
There
was
another
crack
thunder
and
then
the
rain
came
blinding
sheet
mingled
with
hail
drove
against
the
cliff
bitter
cold
coming
down
you
shouted
Sam
though
how
hoped
help
that
way
could
not
have
said
wait
Frodo
called
back
more
strongly
now
shall
better
soon
feel
better
already
Wait
You
can
anything
without
rope
Rope
cried
Sam
talking
wildly
himself
his
excitement
and
relief
Well
don
deserve
hung
the
end
one
warning
numbskulls
You
nowt
but
ninnyhammer
Sam
Gamgee
that
what
the
Gaffer
said
often
enough
being
word
his
Rope
Stop
chattering
cried
Frodo
now
recovered
enough
feel
both
amused
and
annoyed
Never
mind
your
gaffer
Are
you
trying
tell
yourself
you
got
some
rope
your
pocket
out
with
Yes
Frodo
pack
and
all
Carried
hundreds
miles
and
clean
forgotten
Then
get
busy
and
let
end
down
Quickly
Sam
unslung
his
pack
and
rummaged
There
indeed
the
bottom
was
coil
the
silken
grey
rope
made
the
folk
Lorien
cast
end
his
master
The
darkness
seemed
lift
from
Frodo
eyes
else
his
sight
was
returning
could
see
the
grey
line
came
dangling
down
and
thought
had
faint
silver
sheen
Now
that
had
some
point
the
darkness
fix
his
eyes
felt
less
giddy
Leaning
his
weight
forward
made
the
end
fast
round
his
waist
and
then
grasped
the
line
with
both
hands
Sam
stepped
back
and
braced
his
feet
against
stump
yard
two
from
the
edge
Half
hauled
half
scrambling
Frodo
came
and
threw
himself
the
ground
THE
TAMING
SMEAGOL
609
Thunder
growled
and
rumbled
the
distance
and
the
rain
was
still
falling
heavily
The
hobbits
crawled
away
back
into
the
gully
but
they
did
not
find
much
shelter
there
Rills
water
began
run
down
soon
they
grew
spate
that
splashed
and
fumed
the
stones
and
spouted
out
over
the
cliff
like
the
gutters
vast
roof
should
have
been
half
drowned
down
there
washed
clean
off
said
Frodo
What
piece
luck
you
had
that
rope
Better
luck
thought
sooner
said
Sam
Maybe
you
remember
them
putting
the
ropes
the
boats
started
off
the
Elvish
country
took
fancy
and
stowed
coil
pack
Years
ago
seems
may
help
many
needs
said
Haldir
one
those
folk
And
spoke
right
pity
didn
think
bringing
another
length
said
Frodo
but
left
the
Company
such
hurry
and
confusion
only
had
enough
could
use
get
down
How
long
your
rope
wonder
Sam
paid
out
slowly
measuring
with
his
arms
Five
ten
twenty
thirty
ells
more
less
said
Who
have
thought
Frodo
exclaimed
Who
would
said
Sam
Elves
are
wonderful
folk
looks
bit
thin
but
tough
and
soft
milk
the
hand
Packs
close
too
and
light
light
Wonderful
folk
sure
Thirty
ells
said
Frodo
considering
believe
would
enough
the
storm
passes
before
nightfall
going
try
The
rain
nearly
given
over
already
said
Sam
but
don
you
doing
anything
risky
the
dim
again
Frodo
And
haven
got
over
that
shriek
the
wind
yet
you
have
Like
Black
Rider
sounded
but
one
the
air
they
can
fly
thinking
best
lay
this
crack
till
night
over
And
thinking
that
won
spend
moment
longer
than
need
stuck
this
edge
with
the
eyes
the
Dark
Country
looking
over
the
marshes
said
Frodo
With
that
stood
and
went
down
the
bottom
the
gully
again
looked
out
Clear
sky
was
growing
the
East
once
more
The
skirts
the
storm
were
lifting
ragged
and
wet
and
the
main
battle
had
passed
spread
its
great
wings
over
the
Emyn
Muil
upon
which
the
dark
thought
Sauron
brooded
for
while
Thence
turned
smiting
the
Vale
Anduin
with
hail
and
lightning
and
cast
ing
its
shadow
upon
Minas
Tirith
with
threat
war
Then
lowering
the
mountains
and
gathering
its
great
spires
rolled
slowly
over
Gondor
and
the
skirts
Rohan
until
far
away
the
Riders
the
plain
saw
its
black
towers
moving
behind
the
sun
they
rode
into
the
West
But
here
over
the
desert
and
the
reeking
marshes
the
deep
blue
sky
evening
opened
once
more
and
few
pallid
stars
610
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
appeared
like
small
white
holes
the
canopy
above
the
crescent
moon
good
able
see
again
said
Frodo
breathing
deep
you
know
thought
for
bit
that
had
lost
sight
From
the
lightning
something
else
worse
could
see
nothing
nothing
all
until
the
grey
rope
came
down
seemed
shimmer
somehow
does
look
sort
silver
the
dark
said
Sam
Never
noticed
before
though
can
remember
ever
had
out
since
first
stowed
But
you
set
climbing
Frodo
how
are
you
going
use
Thirty
ells
say
about
eighteen
fathom
that
more
than
your
guess
the
height
the
cliff
Frodo
thought
for
while
Make
fast
that
stump
Sam
said
Then
think
you
shall
have
your
wish
this
time
and
first
lower
you
and
you
need
more
than
use
your
feet
and
hands
fend
yourself
off
the
rock
Though
you
put
your
weight
some
the
ledges
and
give
rest
will
help
When
you
down
follow
feel
quite
myself
again
now
Very
well
said
Sam
heavily
must
let
get
over
took
the
rope
and
made
fast
over
the
stump
nearest
the
brink
then
the
other
end
tied
about
his
own
waist
Reluctantly
turned
and
prepared
over
the
edge
second
time
did
not
however
turn
out
half
bad
had
expected
The
rope
seemed
give
him
confidence
though
shut
his
eyes
more
than
once
when
looked
down
between
his
feet
There
was
one
awkward
spot
where
there
was
ledge
and
the
wall
was
sheer
and
even
undercut
for
short
space
there
slipped
and
swung
out
the
silver
line
But
Frodo
lowered
him
slowly
and
steadily
and
was
over
last
His
chief
fear
had
been
that
the
rope
length
would
give
out
while
was
still
high
but
there
was
still
good
bight
Frodo
hands
when
Sam
came
the
bottom
and
called
down
His
voice
came
clearly
from
below
but
Frodo
could
not
see
him
his
grey
elven
cloak
had
melted
into
the
twilight
Frodo
took
rather
more
time
follow
him
had
the
rope
about
his
waist
and
was
fast
above
and
had
shortened
that
would
pull
him
before
reached
the
ground
still
did
not
want
risk
fall
and
had
not
quite
Sam
faith
this
slender
grey
line
found
two
places
all
the
same
where
had
trust
wholly
smooth
surfaces
where
there
was
hold
even
for
his
strong
hobbit
fingers
and
the
ledges
were
far
apart
But
last
too
was
down
Well
cried
done
escaped
from
the
Emyn
Muil
And
now
what
next
wonder
Maybe
shall
soon
sighing
for
good
hard
rock
under
foot
again
But
Sam
did
not
answer
was
staring
back

Just

Gollum

Better

which
way

thought
seemed
bit
too
easy
you
can
think
any
way
could
have

and
yet

you

Frodo
Climb
and

Sam
scratched
his
head
can
think
how
begging
your
pardon
said
But
don
like
leaving
and
that
fact
stroked
the
rope
end
and
shook
gently
goes
hard
parting
with
anything
brought
out
the
Elf
country
Made
Galadriel
herself
too
maybe
Galadriel
murmured
nodding
his
head
mournfully
looked
and
gave
one
last
pull
the
rope
farewell
the
complete
surprise
both
the
hobbits
came
loose
Sam
fell
over
and
the
long
grey
coils
slithered
silently
down
top
him
Frodo
laughed
Who
tied
the
rope
said
good
thing
held
long
did
think
that
trusted
all
weight
your
knot
Sam
did
not
laugh
may
not
much
good
climbing
Frodo
said
injured
tones
but
know
something
about
rope
and
about
knots
the
family
you
might
say
Why
grand
dad
and
uncle
Andy
after
him
him
that
was
the
Gaffer
eldest
brother
had
rope
walk
over
Tighfield
many
year
And
put
fast
hitch
over
the
stump
anyone
could
have
done
the
Shire
out
Then
the
rope
must
have
broken
frayed
the
rock
edge
expect
said
Frodo
bet
didn
said
Sam
even
more
injured
voice
stooped
and
examined
the
ends
Nor
hasn
neither
Not
strand
Then
afraid
must
have
been
the
knot
said
Frodo
Sam
shook
his
head
and
did
not
answer
was
passing
the
rope
through
his
fingers
thoughtfully
Have
your
own
way
Frodo
said
last
but
think
the
rope
came
off
itself
when
called
coiled
and
stowed
lovingly
his
pack
certainly
came
said
Frodo
and
that
the
chief
thing
But
now
got
think
our
next
move
Night
will
soon
How
beautiful
the
stars
are
and
the
Moon
They
cheer
the
heart
don
they
said
Sam
looking
Elvish
they
are
somehow
And
the
Moon
growing
haven
seen
him
for
night
two
this
cloudy
weather
beginning
give
quite
light
Yes
said
Frodo
but
won
full
for
some
days
don

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Under
the
first
shadows
night
they
started
out
the
next
stage
their
journey
After
while
Sam
turned
and
looked
back
the
way
they
had
come
The
mouth
the
gully
was
black
notch
the
dim
cliff
glad
got
the
rope
said
set
little
puzzle
for
that
footpad
anyhow
can
try
his
nasty
flappy
feet
those
ledges
They
picked
their
steps
away
from
the
skirts
the
cliff
among
wilderness
boulders
and
rough
stones
wet
and
slippery
with
the
heavy
rain
The
ground
still
fell
away
sharply
They
had
not
gone
very
far
when
they
came
upon
great
fissure
that
yawned
suddenly
black
before
their
feet
was
not
wide
but
was
too
wide
jump
across
the
dim
light
They
thought
they
could
hear
water
gurgling
its
depths
curved
away
their
left
northward
back
towards
the
hills
and
barred
their
road
that
direction
any
rate
while
darkness
lasted
had
better
try
way
back
southwards
along
the
line
the
cliff
think
said
Sam
might
find
some
nook
there
even
cave
something
suppose
said
Frodo
tired
and
don
think
can
scramble
among
stones
much
longer
tonight
though
grudge
the
delay
wish
there
was
clear
path
front
then
till
legs
gave
way
They
did
not
find
the
going
any
easier
the
broken
feet
the
Emyn
Muil
Nor
did
Sam
find
any
nook
hollow
shelter
only
bare
stony
slopes
frowned
over
the
cliff
which
now
rose
again
higher
and
more
sheer
they
went
back
the
end
worn
out
they
just
cast
themselves
the
ground
under
the
lee
boulder
lying
not
far
from
the
foot
the
precipice
There
for
some
time
they
sat
huddled
mournfully
together
the
cold
stony
night
while
sleep
crept
upon
them
spite
all
they
could
hold
off
The
moon
now
rode
high
and
clear
Its
thin
white
light
lit
the
faces
the
rocks
and
drenched
the
cold
frowning
walls
the
cliff
turning
all
the
wide
looming
darkness
into
chill
pale
grey
scored
with
black
shadows
Well
said
Frodo
standing
and
drawing
his
cloak
more
closely
round
him
You
sleep
for
bit
Sam
and
take
blanket
Pll
walk
and
down
sentry
for
while
Suddenly
stiffened
and
stooping
gripped
Sam
the
arm
What
that
whispered
Look
over
there
the
cliff
Sam
looked
and
breathed
sharply
through
his
teeth
Ssss
said
That
what
that
Gollum
Snakes
and
adders
And
think
that
thought
that
puzzle
him
with
our
bit
climb
Look
him
Like
nasty
crawling
spider
wall
THE
TAMING
SMEAGOL
613
Down
the
face
precipice
sheer
and
almost
smooth
seemed
the
pale
moonlight
small
black
shape
was
moving
with
its
thin
limbs
splayed
out
Maybe
its
soft
clinging
hands
and
toes
were
finding
crevices
and
holds
that
hobbit
could
ever
have
seen
used
but
looked
was
just
creeping
down
sticky
pads
like
some
large
prowling
thing
insect
kind
And
was
coming
down
head
first
was
smelling
its
way
Now
and
again
lifted
its
head
slowly
turning
right
back
its
long
skinny
neck
and
the
hobbits
caught
glimpse
two
small
pale
gleaming
lights
its
eyes
that
blinked
the
moon
for
moment
and
then
were
quickly
lidded
again
you
think
can
see
said
Sam
don
know
said
Frodo
quietly
but
think
not
hard
even
for
friendly
eyes
see
these
elven
cloaks
cannot
see
you
the
shadow
even
few
paces
And
heard
that
doesn
like
Sun
Moon
Then
why
coming
down
just
here
asked
Sam
Quietly
Sam
said
Frodo
can
smell
perhaps
And
can
hear
keen
Elves
believe
think
has
heard
something
now
our
voices
probably
did
lot
shouting
away
back
there
and
were
talking
far
too
loudly
until
minute
ago
Well
sick
him
said
Sam
come
once
too
often
for
and
going
have
word
with
him
can
don
suppose
could
give
him
the
slip
now
anyway
Drawing
his
grey
hood
well
over
his
face
Sam
crept
stealthily
towards
the
cliff
Careful
whispered
Frodo
coming
behind
Don
alarm
him
much
more
dangerous
than
looks
The
black
crawling
shape
was
now
three
quarters
the
way
down
and
perhaps
fifty
feet
less
above
the
cliff
foot
Crouching
stone
still
the
shadow
large
boulder
the
hobbits
watched
him
seemed
have
come
difficult
passage
troubled
about
something
They
could
hear
him
snuffling
and
now
and
again
there
was
harsh
hiss
breath
that
sounded
like
curse
lifted
his
head
and
they
thought
they
heard
him
spit
Then
moved
again
Now
they
could
hear
his
voice
creaking
and
whistling
Ach
sss
Cautious
precious
More
haste
less
speed
musstn
rissk
our
neck
musst
precious
precious
gollum
lifted
his
head
again
blinked
the
moon
and
quickly
shut
his
eyes
hate
hissed
Nassty
nassty
shivery
light
sss
spies
precious
hurts
our
eyes
was
getting
lower
now
and
the
hisses
became
sharper
and
clearer
Where

Precious

The

Where

Curse

614
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
doesn
sound
knew
were
here
does
whispered
Sam
And
what
his
Precious
Does
mean
the
Hsh
breathed
Frodo
getting
near
now
near
enough
hear
whisper
Indeed
Gollum
had
suddenly
paused
again
and
his
large
head
its
scrawny
neck
was
lolling
from
side
side
was
listening
His
pale
eyes
were
half
unlidded
Sam
restrained
himself
though
his
fingers
were
twitching
His
eyes
filled
with
anger
and
disgust
were
fixed
the
wretched
creature
now
began
move
again
still
whispering
and
hissing
himself
last
was
more
than
dozen
feet
from
the
ground
right
above
their
heads
From
that
point
there
was
sheer
drop
for
the
cliff
was
slightly
undercut
and
even
Gollum
could
not
find
hold
any
kind
seemed
trying
twist
round
legs
first
when
suddenly
with
shrill
whistling
shriek
fell
did
curled
his
legs
and
arms
round
him
like
spider
whose
descending
thread
snapped
Sam
was
out
his
hiding
flash
and
crossed
the
space
between
him
and
the
cliff
foot
couple
leaps
Before
Gollum
could
get
was
top
him
But
found
Gollum
more
than
bargained
for
even
taken
like
that
suddenly
off
his
guard
after
fall
Before
Sam
could
get
hold
long
legs
and
arms
were
wound
round
him
pinning
his
arms
and
clinging
grip
soft
but
horribly
strong
was
squeezing
him
like
slowly
tightening
cords
clammy
fingers
were
feeling
for
his
throat
Then
sharp
teeth
bit
into
his
shoul
der
All
could
was
butt
his
hard
round
head
sideways
into
the
creature
face
Gollum
hissed
and
spat
but
did
not
let
Things
would
have
gone
ill
with
Sam
had
been
alone
But
Frodo
sprang
and
drew
Sting
from
its
sheath
With
his
left
hand
drew
back
Gollum
head
his
thin
lank
hair
stretching
his
long
neck
and
forcing
his
pale
venomous
eyes
stare
the
sky
Let
Gollum
said
This
Sting
You
have
seen
before
once
upon
time
Let
you
feel
this
time
Pll
cut
your
throat
Gollum
collapsed
and
went
loose
wet
string
Sam
got
fingering
his
shoulder
His
eyes
smouldered
with
anger
but
could
not
avenge
himself
his
miserable
enemy
lay
grovelling
the
stones
whimpering
Don
hurt
Don
let
them
hurt
precious
They
won
hurt
will
they
nice
little
hobbitses
didn
mean
harm
but
they
jumps
like
cats
poor
mices
they
did

And
lonely
gollum

Well

But

Gollum
Cruel

Tie

cold
hard
lands
and

gollum
gollum
Sobs
welled
his
gobbling
throat
said
Frodo

must
kill
him
outright
But
can
that
not
things

Poor
wretch
has
done
harm
hasn
said
Sam
rubbing
his
shoulder
Anyway
meant
and
means
warrant
Throttle
our
sleep
that
his
plan
daresay
said
Frodo
But
what
means
another
matter
paused
for
while
thought
Gollum
lay
still
but
stopped
whimpering
Sam
stood
glowering
over
him
seemed
Frodo
then
that
heard
quite
plainly
but
far
off
voices
out
the
past
What
pity
Bilbo
did
not
stab
the
vile
creature
when
had
chance
Pity
was
Pity
that
stayed
his
hand
Pity
and
Mercy
not
strike
without
need
not
feel
any
pity
for
Gollum
deserves
death
Deserves
death
daresay
does
Many
that
live
deserve
death
And
some
die
that
deserve
life
Can
you
give
that
them
Then
not
too
eager
deal
out
death
the
name
justice
fearing
for
your
own
safety
Even
the
wise
cannot
see
all
ends
Very
well
answered
aloud
lowering
his
sword
But
still
afraid
And
yet
you
see
will
not
touch
the
creature
For
now
that
see
him
pity
him
Sam
stared
his
master
who
seemed
speaking
some
one
who
was
not
there
Gollum
lifted
his
head
Yess
wretched
are
precious
whined
Misery
misery
Hobbits
won
kill
nice
hobbits

said
Frodo
But
won
let

You

wickedness
and
mischief
Gollum
You
will
have
come
with
that
all
while
keep
eye
you
But
you
must
help
you
can
One
good
turn
deserves
another
Yess
yes

said
Gollum
sitting
Nice
hobbits
will
come
with
them
Find
them
safe
paths
the
dark
yes
will
And
where
are
they
going
these
cold
hard
lands
wonders
yes
wonders
looked
them
and
faint
light
cunning
and
eagerness
flickered
for
second
his
pale
blinking
eyes
Sam
scowled
him
and
sucked
his
teeth
but
seemed
sense
that
there
was
something
odd
about
his
master
mood
and
that
the
matter
was
beyond
argument
All
the
same
was
amazed
Frodo
reply
Frodo
looked
straight
into
Gollum
eyes
which
flinched
and
616
THE

twisted
away

and

shrieked
Gollum
Once

Yes

But
won
back
Then
suddenly
his
voice
and
language
changed
and
sobbed
his
throat
and
spoke
but
not
them
Leave

and
clenched
his
long
hand
into
bony
fleshless
knot
shaking
towards
the
East

cried
Not

Then
collapsed
again
Gollum
gollum
whimpered
with
his
face
the
ground
Don
look

not
away

your
command
Sméagol
said
Frodo
But
you
really
wish
free
him
again
then
you
must
help
And
that
fear
means
finding
path
towards
him
But
you
need
not
all
the
way
not
beyond
the
gates
his
land
Gollum
sat
again
and
looked
him
under
his
eyelids
over
there
cackled
Always

Orcs

Easy

Frodo

Frodo

and
backed
away
against
the
cliff
Now
said
Frodo
Can

The

Not

Rest

Then

Frodo
and

THE
TAMING
SMEAGOL
617
The
hobbits
seated
themselves
beside
him
one
either
side
with
their
backs
the
stony
wall
resting
their
legs
There
was
need
for
any
arrangement
word
they
knew
that
they
must
not
sleep
for
moment
Slowly
the
moon
went
Shadows
fell
down
from
the
hills
and
all
grew
dark
before
them
The
stars
grew
thick
and
bright
the
sky
above
one
stirred
Gollum
sat
with
his
legs
drawn
knees
under
chin
flat
hands
and
feet
splayed
the
ground
his
eyes
closed
but
seemed
tense
thinking
listening
Frodo
looked
across
Sam
Their
eyes
met
and
they
understood
They
relaxed
leaning
their
heads
back
and
shutting
their
eyes
seeming
Soon
the
sound
their
soft
breathing
could
heard
Gollum
hands
twitched
little
Hardly
perceptibly
his
head
moved
the
left
and
the
right
and
first
one
eye
and
then
the
other
opened
slit
The
hobbits
made
sign
Suddenly
with
startling
agility
and
speed
straight
off
the
ground
with
jump
like
grasshopper
frog
Gollum
bounded
forward
into
the
darkness
But
that
was
just
what
Frodo
and
Sam
had
expected
Sam
was
him
before
had
gone
two
paces
after
his
spring
Frodo
coming
behind
grabbed
his
leg
and
threw
him
Your
rope
might
prove
useful
again
Sam
said
Sam
got
out
the
rope
And
where
were
you
off
the
cold
hard
lands
Gollum
growled
wonders
aye
wonders
find
some
your
orc
friends
warrant
You
nasty
treacherous
crea
ture
round
your
neck
this
rope
ought
and
tight
noose
too
Gollum
lay
quiet
and
tried
further
tricks
did
not
answer
Sam
but
gave
him
swift
venomous
look
All
need
something
keep
hold
him
said
Frodo
want
him
walk
good
tying
his
legs
his
arms
seems
use
them
nearly
much
Tie
one
end
his
ankle
and
keep
grip
the
other
end
stood
over
Gollum
while
Sam
tied
the
knot
The
result
sur
prised
them
both
Gollum
began
scream
thin
tearing
sound
very
horrible
hear
writhed
and
tried
get
his
mouth
his
ankle
and
bite
the
rope
kept
screaming
last
Frodo
was
convinced
that
really
was
pain
but
could
not
from
the
knot
examined
and
found
that
was
not
too
tight
indeed
hardly
tight
enough
Sam
was
gentler
than
his
words
What
the
matter
with
your
said
you
will
try
run
away
you
must
tied
but
don
wish
hurt
you

Gollum

Elves

Nasty

That

guessed
they
were

hobbits
They

618
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
will
not
take
off
you
said
Frodo
not
unless
paused
moment
thought
not
unless
there
any
promise
you
can
make
that
can
trust
will
swear
what
wants
yes
yess
said
Gollum
still
twisting
and
grabbling
his
ankle
hurts
Swear
said
Frodo
Sméagol
said
Gollum
suddenly
and
clearly
opening
his
eyes
wide
and
staring
Frodo
with
strange
light
Sméagol
will
swear
the
Precious
Frodo
drew
himself
and
again
Sam
was
startled
his
words
and
his
stern
voice
the
Precious
How
dare
you
said
Think
One
Ring
rule
them
all
and
the
Darkness
bind
them
Would
you
commit
your
promise
that
Sméagol
will
hold
you
But
more
treacherous
than
you
are
may
twist
your
words
Beware
Gollum
cowered
the
Precious
the
Precious
repeated
And
what
would
you
swear
asked
Frodo
very
very
good
said
Gollum
Then
crawling
Frodo
feet
grovelled
before
him
whispering
hoarsely
shudder
ran
over
him
the
words
shook
his
very
bones
with
fear
Sméagol
will
swear
never
never
let
Him
have
Never
Sméagol
will
save
But
must
swear
the
Precious
not
said
Frodo
looking
down
him
with
stern
pity
All
you
wish
see
and
touch
you
can
though
you
know
would
drive
you
mad
Not
Swear
you
will
For
you
know
where
Yes
you
know
Sméagol
before
you
For
moment
appeared
Sam
that
his
master
had
grown
and
Gollum
had
shrunk
tall
stern
shadow
mighty
lord
who
hid
his
brightness
grey
cloud
and
his
feet
little
whining
dog
Yet
the
two
were
some
way
akin
and
not
alien
they
could
reach
one
another
minds
Gollum
raised
himself
and
began
pawing
Frodo
fawning
his
knees
Down
down
said
Frodo
Now
speak
your
promise
promises
yes
promise
said
Gollum
will
serve
the

stepped

and
avoided
the
touch
their

but
was
friendly
and
indeed
pitifully
anxious

with

and

any

Frodo
spoke

him
and

Frodo
rebuked
him
Sam
said
little
him
any

suspected
him
more
deeply
than
ever
and
possible
liked
the
new

Sméagol
less
than
the
old
Well
Gollum
whatever
call
you
said
now
for
The
Moon
gone
and
the
night
going
better
start
Yes
yes
agreed
Gollum
skipping
about
Off
There
only
one
way
across
between
the
North
end
and
the
South
end
found

Orcs

Very

Very

Follow
Sméagol
took
few
steps
away
and
looked
back
inquiringly
like
dog
inviting
them
for
walk
Wait
bit
Gollum
cried
Sam
Not
too
far
ahead
now
going
your

and
got
the
rope
handy
said
Gollum
Sméagol
promised
the
deep

under
hard
clear
stars
they
set
off
Gollum
led
them
back
northward
for
while
along
the
way
they
had
come
then
slanted
the
right
away
from
the
steep
edge
the
Emyn
Muil
down
the
broken
stony
slopes
towards
the
vast
fens
below
They
faded
swiftly
and
softly
into
the
darkness
Over
all
the
leagues
waste
before
the

Mordor
there
was
black
silence

THE
PASSAGE
THE
MARSHES
Gollum
moved
quickly
with
his
head
and
neck
thrust
forward
often
using
his
hands
well
his
feet
Frodo
and
Sam
were
hard
put
keep
with
him
but
seemed
longer
have
any
thought
escaping
and
they
fell
behind
would
turn
and
wait
for
them
After
time
brought
them
the
brink
the
narrow
gully
that
they
had
struck
before
but
they
were
now
further
from
the
hills
Here
cried
There
way
down
inside
yes
Now
follows
out
out
away
over
there
pointed
south
and
east
towards
the
marshes
The
reek
them
came
their
nostrils
heavy
and
foul
even
the
cool
night
air
Gollum
cast
and
down
along
the
brink
and
length
called
them
Here
can
get
down
here
Sméagol
went
this
way
once
went
this
way
hiding
from
Orcs
led
the
way
and
following
him
the
hobbits
climbed
down
into
the
gloom
was
not
difficult
for
the
rift
was
this
point
only
some
fifteen
feet
deep
and
about
dozen
across
There
was
running
water
the
bottom
was
fact
the
bed
one
the
many
small
rivers
that
trickled
down
from
the
hills
feed
the
stagnant
pools
and
mires
beyond
Gollum
turned
the
right
southward
more
less
and
splashed
along
with
his
feet
the
shallow
stony
stream
seemed
greatly
delighted
feel
the
water
and
chuckled
himself
sometimes
even
croaking
sort
song
The
cold
hard
lands
they
bites
our
hands
they
gnaws
our
feet
The
rocks
and
stones
are
like
old
bones
all
bare
meat
But
stream
and
pool
wet
and
cool
nice
for

came
into
his
eyes
and
Sam
catching
the

Alive

These

only
made

Sam

problem
that
had
been
troubling
him
from
the
moment
when
understood
that
his
master
was
going
adopt
Gollum

the
problem
food
did
not
occur
him
that
his
master
might
also
have

but
supposed
Gollum
had
Indeed
how
had
Gollum
kept
himself
all
his
lonely

Not

Sam

Not

Well

Sam
Gamgee
for

They
stumbled
along
the
dark
winding
gully
for
long
time
seemed
the
tired
feet
Frodo
and
Sam
The
gully
turned
eastward
and
they
went
broadened
and
got
gradually
shal
lower
last
the
sky
above
grew
faint
with
the
first
grey
morning
Gollum
had
shown
signs
tiring
but
now
looked
and
halted
Day
near
whispered
Day
was
something
that
might
overhear
him
and
spring
him
Sméagol

Frodo

You

THE

wall
the
gully
was
not
much
more
than
tall
man
height
now
and
its
base
there
were
wide
flat
shelves
dry
stone
the
water
ran
channel
the
other
side
Frodo
and
Sam
sat
one
the
flats
resting
their
backs
Gollum
paddled
and
scrabbled
the
stream
must
take
little
food
said
Frodo
Are
you
hungry
Sméagol
have
very
little
share
but
will
spare
you
what
can
the
word
hungry
greenish
light
was
kindled
Gollum
pale
eyes
and
they
seemed
protrude
further
than
ever
from
his
thin
sickly
face
For
moment
relapsed
into
his
old
Gollum
manner
are
famisshed
yes
famisshed
are
precious
said
What
they
eats
Have
they
nice
fisshes
His
tongue
lolled
out
between
his
sharp
yellow
teeth
licking
his
colourless
lips
have
got
fish
said
Frodo
have
only
got
this
held
wafer
lembas
and
water
the
water
here
fit
drink
Yess
yess
nice
water
said
Gollum
Drink
drink
while
can
But
what
they
got
precious
crunchable
tasty
Frodo
broke
off
portion
wafer
and
handed
him
its
leaf
wrapping
Gollum
sniffed
the
leaf
and
his
face
changed
spasm
disgust
came
over
and
hint
his
old
malice
Sméagol
smells
said
Leaves
out
the
Elf
country
gah
They
stinks
climbed
those
trees
and
couldn
wash
the
smell
off
his
hands
nice
hands
Dropping
the
leaf
took
corner
the
lembas
and
nibbled
spat
and
fit
coughing
shook
him
Ach
spluttered
You
try
choke
poor
Sméagol
Dust
and
ashes
can
eat
that
must
starve
But
Sméagol
doesn
mind
Nice
hobbits
Sméagol
has
promised
will
starve
can
eat
hobbits
food
will
starve
Poor
thin
Sméagol
sorry
said
Frodo
but
can
help
you
afraid
think
this
food
would
you
good
you
would
try
But
perhaps
you
can
even
try
not
yet
anyway
The
hobbits
munched
their
embas
silence
Sam
thought
that
tasted
far
better
somehow
than
had
for
good
while
Gollum
behaviour
had
made
him
attend
its
flavour
again
But
did
not
feel
comfortable
Gollum
watched
every
morsel
from
hand
mouth
like
expectant
dog
diner
chair
Only
when
they
had
finished
and
were
preparing
rest
was
apparently
convinced
that
they
had
hidden
dainties
that
could
share
Then
went
and
sat
himself
few
paces
away
and
whimpered
little
Look
here
Sam
whispered
Frodo
not
too
softly
did
not
really
care
whether
Gollum
heard
him
not
got
get
some
sleep
but
not
both
together
with
that
hungry
villain
nigh
promise

Gollum
won

hurry
Pll
warrant
You
sleep
Frodo
and
call
you
when
can
keep
eyelids
propped
Turn
and
about
same
before
while
loose
Perhaps
you
right
Sam
said
Frodo
speaking
openly
There
change
him
but
just
what
kind
change
and
how
deep
not
sure
yet
Seriously
though
don
think
there
any
need
for
fear
present
Still
watch
you
wish
Give
about
two
hours
not
more
and
then
call
tired
was
Frodo
that
his
head
fell
forward
his
breast
and
slept
almost
soon
had
spoken
the
words
Gollum
seemed
longer
have
any
fears
curled
and
went
quickly
sleep
quite
unconcerned
Presently
his
breath
was
hissing
softly
through
his
clenched
teeth
but
lay
still
stone
After
while
fearing
that
would
drop
off
himself
sat
listening
his
two
companions
breathing
Sam
got
and
gently
prodded
Gollum
His
hands
uncurled
and
twitched
but
made
other
movement
Sam
bent
down
and
said
fissh
close
his
ear
but
there
was
response
not
even
catch
Gollum
breathing
Sam
scratched
his
head
Must
really
asleep
muttered
And
was
like
Gollum
wouldn
wake
never
again
restrained
the
thoughts
his
sword
and
the
rope
that
sprang
his
mind
and
went
and
sat
down
his
master
When
woke
the
sky
above
was
dim
not
lighter
but
darker
than
when
they
had
breakfasted
Sam
leapt
his
feet
Not
least
from
his
own
feeling
vigour
and
hunger
suddenly
understood
that
had
slept
the
daylight
away
nine
hours
least
Frodo
was
still
fast
asleep
lying
now
stretched
his
side
Gollum
was
not
seen
Various
reproachful
names
for
himself
came
Sam
mind
drawn
from
the
Gaffer
large
paternal
word
hoard
then
also
occurred
him
that
his
master
had
been
right
there
had
for
the
present
been
nothing
guard
against
They
were
any
rate
both
alive
and
unthrottled
Poor
wretch
said
half
remorsefully
Now
wonder
where
got
Not
far
not
far
said
voice
above
him
looked
and
saw
the
shape
Gollum
large
head
and
ears
against
the
evening
sky
Here
what
are
you
doing
cried
Sam
his
suspicions
coming
back
soon
saw
that
shape
Sméagol
hungry
said
Gollum
back
soon
Come
back
now
shouted
Sam
Come
back
But
Gollum
had
vanished
Frodo
woke
the
sound
Sam
shout
and
sat
rubbing
his
eyes
Hullo
said
Anything
wrong
What
the
time
624
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
dunno
said
Sam
After
sundown
reckon
And
gone
off
Says
hungry
Don
worry
said
Frodo
There
help
for
But
come
back
you
see
The
promise
will
hold
yet
while
And
won
leave
his
Precious
anyway
Frodo
made
light
when
learned
that
they
had
slept
soundly
for
hours
with
Gollum
and
very
hungry
Gollum
too
loose
beside
them
Don
think
any
your
gaffer
hard
names
said
You
were
worn
out
and
has
turned
out
well
are
now
both
rested
And
have
hard
road
ahead
the
worst
road
all
About
the
food
said
Sam
How
long
going
take
this
job
And
when
done
what
are
going
then
This
waybread
keeps
you
your
legs
wonderful
way
though
doesn
satisfy
the
innards
proper
you
might
say
not
feeling
anyhow
meaning
disrespect
them
made
But
you
have
eat
some
every
day
and
doesn
grow
reckon
got
enough
last
say
three
weeks
and
that
with
tight
belt
and
light
tooth

bit
free
with

don
know
how
long

said
Frodo
were
miserably
delayed
the
hills
But
Samwise
Gamgee
dear
hobbit
indeed
Sam
dearest
hobbit
friend
friends
not
think
need
give
thought
what
comes
after
that
the
job
you
put
what
hope
there
that
ever
shall
And
who
knows
what
will
come
that
the
One

Fire

again
think
not
can
nurse
our
limbs
bring
Mount
Doom
that
all
can
More
than
can
begin
feel
Sam
nodded
silently
took
his
master
hand
and
bent
over
did
not
kiss
though
his
tears
fell
Then
turned
away
drew
his
sleeve
over
his
nose
and
got
and
stamped
about
trying
whistle
and
saying
between
the
efforts
Where
that
dratted
creature
was
actually
not
long
before
Gollum
returned
but
came
quietly
that
they
did
not
hear
him
till
stood
before
them
His
fingers
and
face
were
soiled
with
black
mud
was
still
chewing
and
slavering
What
was
chewing
they
did
not
ask
like
think
Worms
beetles
something
slimy
out
holes
thought
Sam
Brr
The
nasty
creature
the
poor
wretch
Gollum
said
nothing
them
until
had
drunk
deeply
and
washed
himself
the
stream
Then
came
them
licking
his
lips
Better
now
said
Are
rested
Ready
Nice
hobbits
they
sleep
beautifully
Trust
Sméagol
now
Very
very
good
The
next
stage
their
journey
was
much
the
same
the
last
they
went
the
gully
became
ever
shallower
and
the
slope
its
THE

THE

625
floor
more
gradual
Its
bottom
was
less
stony
and
more
earthy
and
slowly
its
sides
dwindled
mere
banks
began
wind
and
wander
That
night
drew
its
end
but
clouds
were
now
over
moon
and
star
and
they
knew
the
coming
day
only
the
slow
spreading
the
thin
grey
light
chill
hour
they
came
the
end
the
water
course
The
banks
became
moss
grown
mounds
Over
the
last
shelf
rotting
stone
the
stream
gurgled
and
fell
down
into
brown
bog
and
was
lost
Dry
reeds
hissed
and
rattled
though
they
could
feel
wind
either
side
and
front
wide
fens
and
mires
now
lay
stretching
away
southward
and
eastward
into
the
dim
half
light
Mists
curled
and
smoked
from
dark
and
noisome
pools
The
reek
them
hung
stifling
the
still
air
Far
away
now
almost
due
south
the
mountain
walls
Mordor
loomed
like
black
bar
rugged
clouds
floating
above
dangerous
fog
bound
sea
The
hobbits
were
now
wholly
the
hands
Gollum
They
did
not
know
and
could
not
guess
that
misty
light
that
they
were
fact
only
just
within
the
northern
borders
the
marshes
the
main
expanse
which
lay
south
them
They
could
they
had
known
the
lands
with
some
delay
have
retraced
their
steps
little
and
then
turning
east
have
come
round
over
hard
roads
the
bare
plain
Dagorlad
the
field
the
ancient
battle
before
the
gates
Mordor
Not
that
there
was
great
hope
such
course
that
stony
plain
there
was
cover
and
across
ran
the
highways
the
Orcs
and
the
soldiers
the
Enemy
Not
even
the
cloaks
Lorien
would
have
concealed
them
there
How
shape
our
course
now
Sméagol
asked
Frodo
Must
cross
these
evil
smelling
fens
need
need
all
said
Gollum
Not
hobbits
want
reach
the
dark
mountains
and
see
Him
very
quick
Back
little
and
round
little
his
skinny
arm
waved
north
and
east
and
you
can
come
hard
cold
roads
the
very
gates
His
country
Lots
His
people
will
there
looking
out
for
guests
very
pleased
take
them
straight
Him
yes
His
Eye
watches
that
way
all
the
time
caught
Sméagol
there
long
ago
Gollum
shuddered
But
Sméagol
has
used
his
eyes
since
then
yes
yes
used
eyes
and
feet
and
nose
since
then
know
other
ways
More
difficult
not
quick
but
better
don
want
Him
see
Follow
Sméagol
can
take
you
through
the
marshes
through
the
mists
nice
thick
mists
Follow
Sméagol
very
carefully
and
you
may
long
way
quite
long
way
before
catches
you

perhaps
626
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
was
already
day
windless
and
sullen
morning
and
the
marsh
reeks
lay
heavy
banks
sun
pierced
the
low
clouded
sky
and
Gollum
seemed
anxious
continue
the
journey
once
after
brief
rest
they
set
out
again
and
were
soon
lost
shadowy
silent
world
cut
off
from
all
view
the
lands
about
either
the
hills
that
they
had
left
the
mountains
that
they
sought
They
went
slowly
single
file
Gollum
Sam
Frodo
Frodo
seemed
the
most
weary
the
three
and
slow
though
they
went
often
lagged
The
hobbits
soon
found
that
what
had
looked
like
one
vast
fen
was
really
endless
network
pools
and
soft
mires
and
winding
half
strangled
water
courses
Among
these
cunning
eye
and
foot
could
thread
wandering
path
Gollum
certainly
had
that
cunning
and
needed
all
His
head
its
long
neck
was
ever
turning
this
way
and
that
while
sniffed
and
muttered
all
the
time
himself
Sometimes
would
hold
his
hand
and
halt
them
while
went
forward
little
crouching
testing
the
ground
with
fingers
toes
merely
listening
with
one
ear
pressed
the
earth
was
dreary
and
wearisome
Cold
clammy
winter
still
held
sway
this
forsaken
country
The
only
green
was
the
scum
livid
weed
the
dark
greasy
surfaces
the
sullen
waters
Dead
grasses
and
rotting
reeds
loomed
the
mists
like
ragged
shadows
long
forgotten
summers
the
day
wore
the
light
increased
little
and
the
mists
lifted
growing
thinner
and
more
transparent
Far
above
the
rot
and
vapours
the
world
the
Sun
was
riding
high
and
golden
now
serene
country
with
floors
dazzling
foam
but
only
passing
ghost
her
could
they
see
below
bleared
pale
giving
colour
and
warmth
But
even
this
faint
reminder
her
presence
Gollum
scowled
and
flinched
halted
their
journey
and
they
rested
squatting
like
little
hunted
animals
the
borders
great
brown
reed
thicket
There
was
deep
silence
only
scraped
its
surfaces
the
faint
quiver
empty
seed
plumes
and
broken
grass
blades
trembling
small
air
movements
that
they
could
not
feel
Not
bird
said
Sam
mournfully
birds
said
Gollum
Nice
birds
licked
his
teeth
birds
here
There
are
snakeses
wormses
things
the
pools
Lots
things
lots
nasty
things
birds
ended
sadly
Sam
looked
him
with
distaste
passed
the
third
day
their
journey
with
Gollum
Before
the
shadows
evening
were
long
happier
lands
they
went
again
always
and
with
only
brief
halts
These
they
made
not
much
for
rest
help
Gollum
for
now
even
had

THE

great
care
and
was
sometimes
loss
for
while
They
had
come
the
very
midst
the
Dead
Marshes
and
was
dark
They
walked
slowly
stooping
keeping
close
line
following
attentively
every
move
that
Gollum
made
The
fens
grew
more
wet
opening
into
wide
stagnant
meres
among
which
grew
more
and
more
difficult
find
the
firmer
places
where
feet
could
tread
without
sinking
into
gurgling
mud
The
travellers
were
light
maybe
none
them
would
ever
have
found
way
through
Presently
grew
altogether
dark
the
air
itself
seemed
black
and
heavy
breathe
When
lights
appeared
Sam
rubbed
his
eyes
thought
his
head
was
going
queer
first
saw
one
with
the
corner
his
left
eye
wisp
pale
sheen
that
faded
away
but
others
appeared
soon
after
some
like
dimly
shining
smoke
some
like
misty
flames
flickering
slowly
above
unseen
candles
here
and
there
they
twisted
like
ghostly
sheets
unfurled
hidden
hands
But
neither
his
companions
spoke
word
last
Sam
could
bear
longer
What
all
this
Gollum
said
whisper
These
lights
They
all
round
now
Are
trapped
Who
are
they
Gollum
looked
dark
water
was
before
him
and
was
crawling
the
ground
this
way
and
that
doubtful
the
way
Yes
they
are
all
round
whispered
The
tricksy
lights
Candles
corpses
yes
yes
Don
you
heed
them
Don
look
Don
follow
them
Where
the
master
Sam
looked
back
and
found
that
Frodo
had
lagged
again
could
not
see
him
went
some
paces
back
into
the
darkness
not
daring
move
far
call
more
than
hoarse
whisper
Suddenly
stumbled
against
Frodo
who
was
standing
lost
thought
looking
the
pale
lights
His
hands
hung
stiff
his
sides
water
and
slime
were
dripping
from
them
Come
Frodo
said
Sam
Don
look
them
Gollum
says
mustn
Let
keep
with
him
and
get
out
this
cursed
place
quick
can
can
All
right
said
Frodo
returning
out
dream
coming
Hurrying
forward
again
Sam
tripped
catching
his
foot
some
old
root
tussock
fell
and
came
heavily
his
hands
which
sank
deep
into
sticky
ooze
that
his
face
was
brought
close
the
surface
the
dark
mere
There
was
faint
hiss
noisome
smell
went
the
lights
flickered
and
danced
and
swirled
For
moment
the
water
below
him
looked
like
some
window
glazed
with
grimy
glass
through
which
was
peering
Wrenching
his
hands
out
the
bog
sprang
back
with
cry
There
are
dead
things
dead
faces
the
water
said
with
horror
Dead
faces
628
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Gollum
laughed
The
Dead
Marshes
yes
yes
that
their
name
cackled
You
should
not
look
when
the
candles
are
lit
Who
are
they
What
are
they
asked
Sam
shuddering
turning
Frodo
who
was
now
behind
him
don
know
said
Frodo
dreamlike
voice
But
have
seen
them
too
the
pools
when
the
candles
were
lit
They
lie
all
the
pools
pale
faces
deep
deep
under
the
dark
water
saw
them
grim
faces
and
evil
and
noble
faces
and
sad
Many
faces
proud
and
fair
and
weeds
their
silver
hair
But
all
foul
all
rotting
all
dead
fell
light
them
Frodo
hid
his
eyes
his
hands
know
not
who
they
are
but
thought
saw
there
Men
and
Elves
and
Orcs
beside
them
Yes
yes
said
Gollum
All
dead
all
rotten
Elves
and
Men
and
Orcs
The
Dead
Marshes
There
was
great
battle
long
ago
yes
they
told
him
when
Sméagol
was
young
when
was
young
before
the
Precious
came
was
great
battle
Tall
Men
with
long
swords
and
terrible
Elves
and
Orcses
shrieking
They
fought
the
plain
for
days
and
months
the
Black
Gates
But
the
Marshes
have
grown
since
then
swallowed
the
graves
always
creeping
creeping
But
that
age
and
more
ago
said
Sam
The
Dead
can
really
there
some
devilry
hatched
the
Dark
Land
Who
knows
Sméagol
doesn
know
answered
Gollum
You
cannot
reach
them
you
cannot
touch
them
tried
once
yes
precious
tried
once
but
you
cannot
reach
them
Only
shapes
see
perhaps
not
touch
precious
All
dead
Sam
looked
darkly
him
and
shuddered
again
thinking
that
guessed
why
Sméagol
had
tried
touch
them
Well
don
want
see
them
said
Never
again
Can
get
and
get
away
Yes
yes
said
Gollum
But
slowly
very
slowly
Very
carefully
hobbits
down
join
the
Dead
ones
and
light
little
candles
Follow
Sméagol
Don
look
lights
crawled
away
the
right
seeking
for
path
round
the
mere
They
came
close
behind
stooping
often
using
their
hands
even
did
Three
precious
little
Gollums
row
shall
this
goes
much
longer
thought
Sam
last
they
came
the
end
the
black
mere
and
they
crossed
perilously
crawling
hopping
from
one
treacherous
island
tuss
ock
another
Often
they
floundered
stepping
falling
hands
first
into
waters
noisome
cesspool
till
they
were
slimed
and
fouled
almost
their
necks
and
stank
one
another
nostrils
was
late
the
night
when
length
they
reached
firmer
ground
again
Gollum
hissed
and
whispered
himself
but
appeared
that
was
pleased
some
mysterious
way
some
blended
sense
THE
PASSAGE

MARSHES
629
feel
and
smell
and
uncanny
memory
for
shapes
the
dark
seemed
know
just
where
was
again
and
sure
his
road
ahead
Now
said
Nice
hobbits
Brave
hobbits
Very
very
weary
course
are
precious
all
But
must
take
master
away
from
the
wicked
lights
yes
yes
must
With
these
words
started
off
again
almost
trot
down
what
appeared
long
lane
between
high
reeds
and
they
stumbled
after
him
quickly
they
could
But
little
while
stopped
suddenly
and
sniffed
the
air
doubtfully
hissing
was
troubled
displeased
again
What
growled
Sam
misinterpreting
the
signs
What
the
need
sniff
The
stink
nearly
knocks
down
with
nose
held
You
stink
and
master
stinks
the
whole
place
stinks
Yes
yes
and
Sam
stinks
answered
Gollum
Poor
Sméagol
smells
but
good
Sméagol
bears
Helps
nice
master
But
that
matter
The
air
moving
change
coming
Sméagol
wonders
not
happy
went
again
but
his
uneasiness
grew
and
every
now
and
again
stood
his
full
height
craning
his
neck
eastward
and
southward
For
some
time
the
hobbits
could
not
hear
feel
what
was
troubling
him
Then
suddenly
all
three
halted
stiffening
and
listening
Frodo
and
Sam
seemed
that
they
heard
far
away
long
wailing
cry
high
and
thin
and
cruel
They
shivered
the
same
moment
the
stirring
the
air
became
perceptible
them
and
grew
very
cold
they
stood
straining
their
ears
they
heard
noise
like
wind
coming
the
distance
The
misty
lights
wavered
dimmed
and
went
out
Gollum
would
not
move
stood
shaking
and
gibbering
him
self
until
with
rush
the
wind
came
upon
them
hissing
and
snarling
over
the
marshes
The
night
became
less
dark
light
enough
for
them
see
half
see
shapeless
drifts
fog
curling
and
twisting
rolled
over
them
and
passed
them
Looking
they
saw
the
clouds
breaking
and
shredding
and
then
high
the
south
the
moon
glim
mered
out
riding
the
flying
wrack
For
moment
the
sight
gladdened
the
hearts
the
hobbits
but
Gollum
cowered
down
muttering
curses
the
White
Face
Then
Frodo
and
Sam
staring
the
sky
breathing
deeply
the
fresher
air
saw
come
small
cloud
flying
from
the
accursed
hills
black
shadow
loosed
from
Mordor
vast
shape
winged
and
omin
ous
scudded
across
the
moon
and
with
deadly
cry
went
away
westward
outrunning
the
wind
its
fell
speed
They
fell
forward
grovelling
heedlessly
the
cold
earth
But
the
630
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
shadow
horror
wheeled
and
returned
passing
lower
now
right
above
them
sweeping
the
fen
reek
with
its
ghastly
wings
And
then
was
gone
flying
back
Mordor
with
the
speed
the
wrath
Sauron
and
behind
the
wind
roared
away
leaving
the
Dead
Marshes
bare
and
bleak
The
naked
waste
far
the
eye
could
pierce
even
the
distant
menace
the
mountains
was
dappled
with
the
fitful
moonlight
Frodo
and
Sam
got
rubbing
their
eyes
like
children
wakened
from
evil
dream
find
the
familiar
night
still
over
the
world
But
Gollum
lay
the
ground
had
been
stunned
They
roused
him
with
difficulty
and
for
some
time
would
not
lift
his
face
but
knelt
forward
his
elbows
covering
the
back
his
head
with
his
large
flat
hands
Wraiths
wailed
Wraiths
wings
The
Precious
their
master
They
see
everything
everything
Nothing
can
hide
from
them
Curse
the
White
Face
And
they
tell
Him
everything
sees
knows
Ach
gollum
gollum
gollum
was
not
until
the
moon
had
sunk
westering
far
away
beyond
Tol
Brandir
that
would
get
make
move
From
that
time
Sam
thought
that
sensed
change
Gollum
again
was
more
fawning
and
would
friendly
but
Sam
sur
prised
some
strange
looks
his
eyes
times
especially
towards
Frodo
and
went
back
more
and
more
into
his
old
manner
speaking
And
Sam
had
another
growing
anxiety
Frodo
seemed
weary
weary
the
point
exhaustion
said
nothing
indeed
hardly
spoke
all
and
did
not
complain
but
walked
like
one
who
carries
load
the
weight
which
ever
increasing
and
dragged
along
slower
and
slower
that
Sam
had
often
beg
Gollum
wait
and
not
leave
their
master
behind
fact
with
every
step
towards
the
gates
Mordor
Frodo
felt
the
Ring
its
chain
about
his
neck
grow
more
burdensome
was
now
beginning
feel
actual
weight
dragging
him
earthwards
But
far
more
was
troubled
the
Eye
called
himself
was
that
more
than
the
drag
the
Ring
that
made
him
cower
and
stoop
walked
The
Eye
that
horrible
growing
sense
hostile
will
that
strove
with
great
power
pierce
all
shadows
cloud
and
earth
and
flesh
and
see
you
pin
you
under
its
deadly
gaze
naked
immovable
thin
frail
and
thin
the
veils
were
become
that
still
warded
off
Frodo
knew
just
where
the
present
habitation
and
heart
that
will
now
was
certainly
man
can
tell
the
direction
the
sun
with
his
eyes
shut
was
facing
and
its
potency
beat
upon
his
brow
Gollum
probably
felt
something
the
same
sort
But
what
went
THE
PASSAGE
THE
MARSHES
631
his
wretched
heart
between
the
pressure
the
Eye
and
the
lust
the
Ring
that
was
near
and
his
grovelling
promise
made
half
the
fear
cold
iron
the
hobbits
did
not
guess
Frodo
gave
thought
Sam
mind
was
occupied
mostly
with
his
master
hardly
noticing
the
dark
cloud
that
had
fallen
his
own
heart
put
Frodo
front
him
now
and
kept
watchful
eye
every
movement
his
supporting
him
stumbled
and
trying
encourage
him
with
clumsy
words
When
day
came
last
the
hobbits
were
surprised
see
how
much
closer
the
ominous
mountains
had
already
drawn
The
air
was
now
clearer
and
colder
and
though
still
far
off
the
walls
Mordor
were
longer
cloudy
menace
the
edge
sight
but
grim
black
towers
they
frowned
across
dismal
waste
The
marshes
were
end
dying
away
into
dead
peats
and
wide
flats
dry
cracked
mud
The
land
ahead
rose
long
shallow
slopes
barren
and
pitiless
towards
the
desert
that
lay
Sauron
gate
While
the
grey
light
lasted
they
cowered
under
black
stone
like
worms
shrinking
lest
the
winged
terror
should
pass
and
spy
them
with
its
cruel
eyes
The
remainder
that
journey
was
shadow
growing
fear
which
memory
could
find
nothing
rest
upon
For
two
more
nights
they
struggled
through
the
weary
pathless
land
The
air
seemed
them
grew
harsh
and
filled
with
bitter
reek
that
caught
their
breath
and
parched
their
mouths
last
the
fifth
morning
since
they
took
the
road
with
Gollum
they
halted
once
more
Before
them
dark
the
dawn
the
great
mountains
reached
roofs
smoke
and
cloud
Out
from
their
feet
were
flung
huge
buttresses
and
broken
hills
that
were
now
the
nearest
scarce
dozen
miles
away
Frodo
looked
round
horror
Dreadful
the
Dead
Marshes
had
been
and
the
arid
moors
the
Noman
lands
more
loathsome
far
was
the
country
that
the
crawling
day
now
slowly
unveiled
his
shrinking
eyes
Even
the
Mere
Dead
Faces
some
haggard
phantom
green
spring
would
come
but
here
neither
spring
nor
summer
would
ever
come
again
Here
nothing
lived
not
even
the
leprous
growths
that
feed
rottenness
The
gasping
pools
were
choked
with
ash
and
crawling
muds
sickly
white
and
grey
the
mountains
had
vomited
the
filth
their
entrails
upon
the
lands
about
High
mounds
crushed
and
powdered
rock
great
cones
earth
fire
blasted
and
poison
stained
stood
like
obscene
graveyard
endless
rows
slowly
revealed
the
reluctant
light
They
had
come
the
desolation
that
lay
before
Mordor
the
lasting
monument
the
dark
labour
its
slaves
that
should
endure
when
all
their
purposes
were
made
void
land
defiled
diseased
632
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
beyond
all
healing
unless
the
Great
Sea
should
enter
and
wash
with
oblivion
feel
sick
said
Sam
Frodo
did
not
speak
For
while
they
stood
there
like
men
the
edge
sleep
where
nightmare
lurks
holding
off
though
they
know
that
they
can
only
come
morning
through
the
shadows
The
light
broadened
and
hardened
The
gasping
pits
and
poisonous
mounds
grew
hideously
clear
The
sun
was
walking
among
clouds
and
long
flags
smoke
but
even
the
sunlight
was
defiled
The
hobbits
had
welcome
for
that
light
unfriendly
seemed
revealing
them
their
helplessness
little
squeaking
ghosts
that
wandered
among
the
ash
heaps
the
Dark
Lord
Too
weary
further
they
sought
for
some
place
where
they
could
rest
For
while
they
sat
without
speaking
under
the
shadow
mound
slag
but
foul
fumes
leaked
out
catching
their
throats
and
choking
them
Gollum
was
the
first
get
Spluttering
and
cursing
rose
and
without
word
glance
the
hobbits
crawled
away
all
fours
Frodo
and
Sam
crawled
after
him
until
they
came
wide
almost
circular
pit
high
banked
upon
the
west
was
cold
and
dead
and
foul
sump
oily
many
coloured
ooze
lay
its
bottom
this
evil
hole
they
cowered
hoping
its
shadow
escape
the
attention
the
Eye
The
day
passed
slowly
great
thirst
troubled
them
but
they
drank
only
few
drops
from
their
bottles
last
filled
the
gully
which
now
they
looked
back
thought
seemed
them
place
peace
and
beauty
The
hobbits
took
turn
watch
first
tired
they
were
neither
them
could
sleep
all
but
the
sun
far
away
was
climbing
down
into
slow
moving
cloud
Sam
dozed
was
Frodo
turn
guard
lay
back
the
slope
the
pit
but
that
did
not
ease
the
sense
burden
that
was
him
looked
the
smoke
streaked
sky
and
saw
strange
phantoms
dark
riding
shapes
and
faces
out
the
past
lost
count
time
hover
ing
between
sleep
and
waking
until
forgetfulness
came
over
him
Suddenly
Sam
woke
thinking
that
heard
his
master
calling
was
evening
Frodo
could
not
have
called
for
had
fallen
asleep
and
had
slid
down
nearly
the
bottom
the
pit
Gollum
was
him
For
moment
Sam
thought
that
was
trying
rouse
Frodo
then
saw
that
was
not
Gollum
was
talking
himself
Sméagol
was
holding
debate
with
some
other
thought
that
used
the
same
voice
but
made
squeak
and
hiss
pale
light
and
green
light
alternated
his
eyes
spoke
Sméagol
promised
said
the
first
thought
Yes
yes

answer

Sméagol
promised

master
Yes
yes
help
the
master
the
master
the
Precious
But
was
master
then
could
help
ourselfs
yes
and
still
keep
promises
But
Sméagol
said
would

very

Nice

took
cruel
rope
off
Sméagol

speaks
nicely
Very
very
good

Let

Not
hurt
the
nice

But
the
Precious
holds

Sméagol
objected
Then
take
said
the
other
and
let
hold
ourselfs
Then
shall
master

Make

Still
Baggins

and
said

Yes

All

But

against
His
orders

Must

The
Wraiths

Must

Sméagol

Not
now
Not

But
and
here
there
was
long
pause
new
thought
had
wakened
Not
yet
Perhaps
not
She
might
help
She
might
yes
Not
that
way
wailed
Sméagol
Yes
wants
wants
Each
time
that
the
second
thought
spoke
Gollum
long
hand
crept
out
slowly
pawing
towards
Frodo
and
then
was
drawn
back
634
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
with
jerk
Sméagol
spoke
again
Finally
both
arms
with
long
fingers
flexed
and
twitching
clawed
towards
his
neck
Sam
had
lain
still
fascinated
this
debate
but
watching
every
move
that
Gollum
made
from
under
his
half
closed
eye
lids
his
simple
mind
ordinary
hunger
the
desire
eat
hobbits
had
seemed
the
chief
danger
Gollum
realized
now
that
was
not
Gollum
was
feeling
the
terrible
call
the
Ring
The
Dark
Lord
was
course
but
Sam
wondered
who
She
was
One
the
nasty
friends
the
little
wretch
had
made
his
wanderings
supposed
Then
forgot
the
point
for
things
had
plainly
gone
far
enough
and
were
getting
dangerous
great
heaviness
was
all
his
limbs
but
roused
himself
with
effort
and
sat
Something
warned
him
careful
and
not
reveal
that
had
overheard
the
debate
let
out
loud
sigh
and
gave
huge
yawn
What
the
time
said
sleepily
Gollum
sent
out
long
hiss
through
his
teeth
stood
for
moment
tense
and
menacing
and
then
collapsed
falling
forward
all
fours
and
crawling
the
bank
the
pit
Nice
hobbits
Nice
Sam
said
Sleepy
heads
yes
sleepy
heads
Leave
good
Sméagol
watch
But
evening
Dusk
creeping
Time
High
time
thought
Sam
And
time
parted
too
Yet
crossed
his
mind
wonder
indeed
Gollum
was
not
now
dangerous
turned
loose
kept
with
them
Curse
him
wish
was
choked
muttered
stumbled
down
the
bank
and
roused
his
master
Strangely
enough
Frodo
felt
refreshed
had
been
dreaming
The
dark
shadow
had
passed
and
fair
vision
had
visited
him
this
land
disease
Nothing
remained
his
memory
yet
because
felt
glad
and
lighter
heart
His
burden
was
less
heavy
him
Gollum
welcomed
him
with
dog
like
delight
chuckled
and
chattered
cracking
his
long
fingers
and
pawing
Frodo
knees
Frodo
smiled
him
Come
said
You
have
guided
well
and
faithfully
This
the
last
stage
Bring
the
Gate
and
then
will
not
ask
you
further
Bring
the
Gate
and
you
may
where
you
wish
only
not
our
enemies
the
Gate
Gollum
squeaked
seeming
surprised
and
fright
ened
the
Gate
master
says
Yes
says
And
good
Sméagol
does
what
asks
yes
But
when
gets
closer
see
perhaps
see
then
won
look
nice
all
with
you
said
Sam
Let
get
over
the
falling
dusk
they
scrambled
out
the
pit
and
slowly
threaded
their
way
through
the
dead
land
They
had
not
gone
far
THE
PASSAGE
THE
MARSHES
635
before
they
felt
once
more
the
fear
that
had
fallen
them
when
the
winged
shape
swept
over
the
marshes
They
halted
cowering
the
evil
smelling
ground
but
they
saw
nothing
the
gloomy
evening
sky
above
and
soon
the
menace
passed
high
overhead
going
maybe
some
swift
errand
from
Barad
dur
After
while
Gollum
got
and
crept
forward
again
muttering
and
shaking
About
hour
after
midnight
the
fear
fell
them
third
time
but
now
seemed
more
remote
were
passing
far
above
the
clouds
rushing
with
terrible
speed
into
the
West
Gollum
however
was
helpless
with
terror
and
was
convinced
that
they
were
being
hunted
that
their
approach
was
known
Three
times
whimpered
Three
times
threat
They
feel
here
they
feel
the
Precious
The
Precious
their
master
cannot
any
further
this
way
use
use
Pleading
and
kind
words
were
longer
any
avail
was
not
until
Frodo
commanded
him
angrily
and
laid
hand
his
sword
hilt
that
Gollum
would
get
again
Then
last
rose
with
snarl
and
went
before
them
like
beaten
dog
they
stumbled
through
the
weary
end
the
night
and
until
the
coming
another
day
fear
they
walked
silence
with
bowed
heads
seeing
nothing
and
hearing
nothing
but
the
wind
hissing
their
ears
Chapter
THE
BLACK
GATE
CLOSED
Before
the
next
day
dawned
their
journey
Mordor
was
over
The
marshes
and
the
desert
were
behind
them
Before
them
darkling
against
pallid
sky
the
great
mountains
reared
their
threatening
heads
Upon
the
west
Mordor
marched
the
gloomy
range
Ephel
Duath
the
Mountains
Shadow
and
upon
the
north
the
broken
peaks
and
barren
ridges
Ered
Lithui
grey
ash
But
these
ranges
approached
one
another
being
indeed
but
parts
one
great
wall
about
the
mournful
plains
Lithlad
and
Gorgoroth
and
the
bitter
inland
sea
Nurnen
amidmost
they
swung
out
long
arms
northward
and
between
these
arms
there
was
deep
defile
This
was
Cirith
Gorgor
the
Haunted
Pass
the
entrance
the
land
the
Enemy
High
cliffs
lowered
upon
either
side
and
thrust
forward
from
its
mouth
were
two
sheer
hills
black
boned
and
bare
Upon
them
stood
the
Teeth
Mordor
two
towers
strong
and
tall
days
long
past
they
were
built
the
Men
Gondor
their
pride
and
power
after
the
overthrow
Sauron
and
his
flight
lest
should
seek
return
his
old
realm
But
the
strength
Gondor
failed
and
men
slept
and
for
long
years
the
towers
stood
empty
Then
Sauron
returned
Now
the
watch
towers
which
had
fallen
into
decay
were
repaired
and
filled
with
arms
and
garrisoned
with
ceaseless
vigilance
Stony
faced
they
were
with
dark
window
holes
staring
north
and
east
and
west
and
each
window
was
full
sleepless
eyes
Across
the
mouth
the
pass
from
cliff
cliff
the
Dark
Lord
had
built
rampart
stone
there
was
single
gate
iron
and
upon
its
battlement
sentinels
paced
unceasingly
Beneath
the
hills
either
side
the
rock
was
bored
into
hundred
caves
and
maggot
holes
there
host
orcs
lurked
ready
signal
issue
forth
like
black
ants
going
war
None
could
pass
the
Teeth
Mordor
and
not
feel
their
bite
unless
they
were
summoned
Sauron
knew
the
secret
passwords
that
would
open
the
Moran
non
the
black
gate
his
land
The
two
hobbits
gazed
the
towers
and
the
wall
despair
Even
from
distance
they
could
see
the
dim
light
the
movement
the
black
guards
upon
the
wall
and
the
patrols
before
the
gate
They
lay
now
peering
over
the
edge
rocky
hollow
beneath
the
outstretched
shadow
the
northmost
buttress
Ephel
Duath
Winging
the
heavy
air
straight
flight
crow
maybe
would
have
flown
but
furlong

from
their
hiding
place
the
black
summit
the
nearer

faint
smoke
curled
above
fire
smouldered
the
hill
beneath
Day
came
and
the
fallow
sun
blinked
over
the
lifeless
ridges
Ered
Lithui
Then
suddenly
the
cry
brazen
throated
trumpets
was
heard
from
the
watch
towers
they
blared
and
far
away
from
hidden
holds
and
outposts
the
hills
came
answering
calls
and
further
still
remote
but
deep
and
ominous
there
echoed
the
hollow
land
beyond
the
mighty
horns
and
drums
Barad
dtr
Another
dreadful
day
fear
and
toil
had
come
Mordor
and
the
night
guards
were
summoned
their
dungeons
and
deep
halls
and
the
day
guards
evil
eyed
and
fell
were
marching
their
posts
Steel
gleamed
dimly
the
battlement
Well
here
are
said
Sam
Here
the
Gate
and
looks
that
about
far
are
ever
going
get
word
but
the
Gaffer
would
have
thing
two
say
saw
now
Often
said
come
bad
end
didn
watch
step
did
But
now
don
suppose
ever
see
the
old
fellow
again
miss
his
chance
told
Sam
more
the
pity
could
telling
long
got
breath
only
could
see
his
old
face
again
But
have
get
wash
first
wouldn
know
suppose
good
asking
what
way
now
can
further
unless
want
ask
the
Orcs
for
lift
said
Gollum
use
can
further
Sméagol
said
said
the
Gate
and
then
see
And
see
yes
precious
see
Sméagol
knew
hobbits
could
not
this
way
yes
Sméagol
knew
Then
what
the
plague
did
you
bring
here
for
said
Sam
not
feeling
the
mood
just
reasonable
Master
said
Master
says
Bring
the
Gate
good
Sméagol
does
Master
said
wise
master
did
said
Frodo
His
face
was
grim
and
set
but
resolute
was
filthy
haggard
and
pinched
with
weariness
but
cowered
longer
and
his
eyes
were
clear
said
because
purpose
enter
Mordor
and
know
other
way
Therefore
shall
this
way
not
ask
anyone
with
master
wailed
Gollum
pawing
him
and
seeming
great
distress
use
that
way
use
Don
take
the
Precious
Him
eat
all
gets
eat
all
the
world
Keep
nice
master
and
kind
Sméagol
Don
let
Him
have
away
nice
places
and
give
back
little
Sméagol
Yes
yes
master
give
back
Sméagol
will
keep
safe
will
lots

Hobbits

638
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
commanded
the
land
Mordor
and
therefore
shall
said
Frodo
there
only
one
way
then
must
take
What
comes
after
must
come
Sam
said
nothing
The
look
Frodo
face
was
enough
for
him
knew
that
words
his
were
useless
And
after
all
never
had
any
real
hope
the
affair
from
the
beginning
but
being
cheerful
hobbit
had
not
needed
hope
long
despair
could
postponed
Now
they
were
come
the
bitter
end
But
had
stuck
his
master
all
the
way
that
was
what
had
chiefly
come
for
and
would
still
stick
him
His
master
would
not
Mordor
alone
Sam
would
with
him
and
any
rate
they
would
get
rid
Gollum
Gollum
however
did
not
intend
got
rid
yet
knelt
Frodo
feet
wringing
his
hands
and
squeaking
Not
this
way
master
pleaded
There
another
way
yes
indeed
there
Another
way
darker
more
difficult
find
more
secret
But
Sméagol
knows
Let
Sméagol
show
you
Another
way
said
Frodo
doubtfully
looking
down
Gollum
with
searching
eyes
Yess
Yess
indeed
There
was
another
way
Sméagol
found
Let
and
see
still
there
You
have
not
spoken
this
before
Master
did
not
ask
Master
did
not
say
what
meant
does
not
tell
poor
Sméagol
says
Sméagol
take
the
Gate
and
then
good
bye
Sméagol
can
run
away
and
good
But
now
says
purpose
enter
Mordor
this
way
Sméagol
very
afraid
does
not
want
lose
nice
master
And
promised
master
made
him
promise
save
the
Precious
But
master
going
take
Him
straight
the
Black
Hand
master
will
this
way
Sméagol
must
save
them
both
and
thinks
another
way
that
there
was
once
upon
time
Nice
master
Sméagol
very
good
always
helps
Sam
frowned
could
have
bored
holes
Gollum
with
his
eyes
would
have
done
His
mind
was
full
doubt
all
appear
ances
Gollum
was
genuinely
distressed
and
anxious
help
Frodo
But
Sam
remembering
the
overheard
debate
found
hard
believe
that
the
long
submerged
Sméagol
had
come
out
top
that
voice
any
rate
had
not
had
the
last
word
the
debate
Sam
guess
was
that
the
Sméagol
and
Gollum
halves
what
his
own
mind
called
Slinker
and
Stinker
had
made
truce
and
temporary
alliance
neither
wanted
the
Enemy
get
the
Ring
both
wished
keep
Frodo
from
capture
and
under
their
eye
long
possible
any
rate
long
Stinker
still
had
chance
laying
hands
his
Precious
THE
BLACK
GATE
CLOSED
639
Whether
there
really
was
another
way
into
Mordor
Sam
doubted
And
good
thing
neither
half
the
old
villain
don
know
what
master
means
thought
knew
that
Frodo
trying
put
end
his
Precious
for
good
and
all
there
trouble
pretty
quick
bet
Anyhow
old
Stinker
frightened
the
Enemy
and
under
orders
some
kind
from
him
was
that
give
away
rather
than
caught
helping
and
rather
than
let
his
Precious
melted
maybe
least
that
idea
And
hope
the
master
will
think
out
carefully
wise
any
but
soft
hearted
that
what
beyond
any
Gamgee
guess
what
next
Frodo
did
not
answer
Gollum
once
While
these
doubts
were
passing
through
Sam
slow
but
shrewd
mind
stood
gazing
out
towards
the
dark
cliff
Cirith
Gorgor
The
hollow
which
they
had
taken
refuge
was
delved
the
side
low
hill
some
little
height
above
long
trenchlike
valley
that
lay
between
and
the
outer
buttresses
the
mountain
wall
the
midst
the
valley
stood
the
black
foundations
the
western
watch
tower
morning
light
the
roads
that
converged
upon
the
Gate
Mordor
could
now
clearly
seen
pale
and
dusty
one
winding
back
northwards
another
dwin
dling
eastwards
into
the
mists
that
clung
about
the
feet
Ered
Lithui
and
third
that
ran
towards
him
bent
sharply
round
the
tower
entered
narrow
defile
and
passed
not
far
below
the
hollow
where
stood
Westward
his
right
turned
skirting
the
shoulders
the
mountains
and
went
off
southwards
into
the
deep
shadows
that
mantled
all
the
western
sides
Ephel
Duath
beyond
his
sight
journeyed
into
the
narrow
land
between
the
mountains
and
the
Great
River
gazed
Frodo
became
aware
that
there
was
great
stir
and
movement
the
plain
seemed
whole
armies
were
the
march
though
for
the
most
part
they
were
hidden
the
reeks
and
fumes
drifting
from
the
fens
and
wastes
beyond
But
here
and
there
caught
the
gleam
spears
and
helmets
and
over
the
levels
beside
the
roads
horsemen
could
seen
riding
many
companies
remembered
his
vision
from
afar
upon
Amon
Hen
few
days
before
though
now
seemed
many
years
ago
Then
knew
that
the
hope
that
had
for
one
wild
moment
stirred
his
heart
was
vain
The
trumpets
had
not
rung
challenge
but
greeting
This
was
assault
upon
the
Dark
Lord
the
men
Gondor
risen
like
avenging
ghosts
from
the
graves
valour
long
passed
away
These
were
Men
other
race
out
the
wide
Eastlands
gathering
the
summons
their
Overlord
armies
that
had
encamped
before
his
Gate
night
and
now
marched
swell
his
mounting
power
suddenly
made
fully
aware
the
peril
their
position
alone

THE

light
day
near
this
vast
menace
Frodo
quickly
drew
his
frail
grey
hood
close
upon
his
head
and
stepped
down
into
the
dell
Then
turned
Gollum
Sméagol
said
will
trust
you
once
more
Indeed
seems
that
must
and
that
fate
receive
help
from
you
where
least
looked
for
and
your
fate
help
whom
you
long
pursued
with
evil
purpose
far
you
have
deserved
well
and
have
kept
your
promise
truly
Truly
say
and
mean
added
with
glance
Sam
for
twice
now
have
been
your
power
and
you
have
done
harm
Nor
have
you
tried
take
from
what
you
once
sought
May
the
third
time
prove
the
best
But
warn
you
Sméagol
you
are
danger
Yes
yes
master
said
Gollum
Dreadful
danger
Sméagol
bones
shake
think
but
doesn
run
away
must
help
nice
master
did
not
mean
the
danger
that
all
share
said
Frodo
mean
danger
yourself
alone
You
swore
promise
what
you
call
the
Precious
Remember
that
will
hold
you
but
will
seek
way
twist
your
own
undoing
Already
you
are
being
twisted
You
revealed
yourself
just
now
foolishly
Give
back
Sméagol
you
said
not
say
that
again
not
let
that
thought
grow
you
You
will
never
get
back
But
the
desire
may
betray
you
bitter
end
You
will
never
get
back
the
last
need
Sméagol
should
put
the
Precious
and
the
Precious
mastered
you
long
ago
wearing
were
command
you
you
would
obey
even
were
leap
from
precipice
cast
yourself
into
the
fire
And
such
would
command
have
care
Sméagol
Sam
looked
his
master
with
approval
but
also
with
surprise
there
was
look
his
face
and
tone
his
voice
that
had
not
known
before
had
always
been
notion
his
that
the
kindness
dear
Frodo
was
such
high
degree
that
must
imply
fair
measure
blindness
course
also
firmly
held
the
incompat
ible
belief
that
Frodo
was
the
wisest
person
the
world
with
the
possible
exception
Old
Bilbo
and
Gandalf
Gollum
his
own
way
and
with
much
more
excuse
his
acquaintance
was
much
briefer
may
have
made
similar
mistake
confusing
kindness
and
blindness
any
rate
this
speech
abashed
and
terrified
him
grovelled
the
ground
and
could
speak
clear
words
but
nice
master
Frodo
waited
patiently
for
while
then
spoke
again
less
sternly
Come
now
Gollum
Sméagol
you
wish
tell
this
other
way
and
show
you
can
what
hope
there
enough
justify
turning
aside
from
plain
path
haste
But
Gollum
was
pitiable
state
and
Frodo
threat
had
quite
THE
BLACK
GATE
CLOSED
641
unnerved
him
was
not
easy
get
any
clear
account
out
him
amid
his
mumblings
and
squeakings
and
the
frequent
interruptions
which
crawled
the
floor
and
begged
them
both
kind
poor
little
Sméagol
After
while
grew
little
calmer
and
Frodo
gathered
bit
bit
that
traveller
followed
the
road
that
turned
west
Ephel
Duath
would
come
time
crossing
circle
dark
trees
the
right
road
went
down
Osgiliath
and
the
bridges
the
Anduin
the
middle
the
road
went
southwards
said
Gollum
never
went
that
way
but
they
say
goes
hundred
leagues
until
you
can
see
the
Great
Water
that
never
still
There
are
lots
fishes
there
and
big
birds
eat
fishes
nice
birds
but
never
went
there
alas
never
had
chance
And
further
still
there
are
more
lands
they
say
but
the
Yellow
Face
very
hot
there
and
there
are
seldom
any
clouds
and
the
men
are
fierce
and
have
dark
faces
not
want
see
that
land
said
Frodo
But
not
wander
from
your
road
What
the
third
turning
yes
yes
there
third
way
said
Gollum
That
the
road
the
left
once
begins
climb
winding
and
climbing
back
towards
the
tall
shadows
When
turns
round
the
black
rock
you
see
suddenly
you
see
above
you
and
you
want
hide
See
see
What
will
you
see
The
old
fortress
very
old
very
horrible
now
used
hear
tales
from
the
South
when
Sméagol
was
young
long
ago
yes
used
tell
lots
tales
the
evening
sitting
the
banks
the
Great
River
the
willow
lands
when
the
River
was
younger
too
gollum
gollum
began
weep
and
mutter
The
hobbits
waited
patiently
Tales
out
the
South
Gollum
went
again
about
the
tall
Men
with
the
shining
eyes
and
their
houses
like
hills
stone
and
the
silver
crown
their
King
and
his
White
Tree
wonderful
tales
They
built
very
tall
towers
and
one
they
raised
was
silver
white
and
there
was
stone
like
the
Moon
and
round
were
great
white
walls
yes
there
were
many
tales
about
the
Tower
the
Moon
That
would
Minas
Ithil
that
Isildur
the
son
Elendil
built
said
Frodo
was
Isildur
who
cut
off
the
finger
the
Enemy
Yes
has
only
four
the
Black
Hand
but
they
are
enough
said
Gollum
shuddering
And
hated
Isildur
city
What
does
not
hate
said
Frodo
But
what
has
the
Tower
the
Moon
with
Well
master
there
was
and
there
the
tall
tower
and
the
white
houses
and
the
wall
but
not
nice
now
not
beautiful
642
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
conquered
long
ago
very
terrible
place
now
Travellers
shiver
when
they
see
they
creep
out
sight
they
avoid
its
shadow
But
master
will
have
that
way
That
the
only
other
way
For
the
mountains
are
lower
there
and
the
old
road
goes
and
until
reaches
dark
pass
the
top
and
then
goes
down
down
again
Gorgoroth
His
voice
sank
whisper
and
shuddered
But
how
will
that
help
asked
Sam
Surely
the
Enemy
knows
all
about
his
own
mountains
and
that
road
will
guarded
close
this
The
tower
isn
empty
not
empty
whispered
Gollum
seems
empty
but
isn
Very
dreadful
things
live
there
Orcs
yes
always
Orcs
but
worse
things
worse
things
live
there
too
The
road
climbs
right
under
the
shadow
the
walls
and
passes
the
gate
Nothing
moves
the
road
that
they
don
know
about
The
things
inside
know
the
Silent
Watchers
that
your
advice
said
Sam
that
should
another
long
march
south
find
ourselves
the
same
fix
worse
one
when
get
there
ever
indeed
said
Gollum
Hobbits
must
see
must
try
understand
does
not
expect
attack
that
way
His
Eye
all
round
but
attends
more
some
places
than
others
can
see
everything
all
once
not
yet
You
see
has
conquered
all
the
country
west
the
Shadowy
Mountains
down
the
River
and
holds
the
bridges
now
thinks
one
can
come
the
Moontower
without
fighting
big
battle
the
bridges
getting
lots
boats
which
they
cannot
hide
and
will
know
about
You
seem
know
lot
about
what
doing
and
thinking
said
Sam
Have
you
been
talking
Him
lately
just
hobnobbing
with
Orcs
Not
nice
hobbit
not
sensible
said
Gollum
giving
Sam
angry
glance
and
turning
Frodo
Sméagol
has
talked
Orcs
yes
course
before
met
master
and
many
peoples
has
walked
very
far
And
what
says
now
many
peoples
are
saying
here
the
North
that
the
big
danger
for
Him
and
for
will
come
out
the
Black
Gate
one
day
one
day
soon
That
the
only
way
big
armies
can
come
But
away
down
west
not
afraid
and
there
are
the
Silent
Watchers
Just
said
Sam
not
put
off
And
are
walk
and
knock
their
gate
and
ask
the
right
road
for
Mordor
are
they
too
silent
answer
not
sense
might
well
here
and
save
ourselves
long
tramp
Don
make
jokes
about
hissed
Gollum
isn
funny
Not
amusing
not
sense
try
and
get
into
Mordor
all
But
master
says
must
will
then
must
try
some
way
But
THE
BLACK
GATE
CLOSED
643
must
not
the
terrible
city
course
not
That
where
Sméagol
helps
nice
Sméagol
though
one
tells
him
what
all
about
Sméagol
helps
again
found
knows
What
did
you
find
asked
Frodo
Gollum
crouched
down
and
his
voice
sank
whisper
again
little
path
leading
into
the
mountains
and
then
stair
narrow
stair
yes
very
long
and
narrow
And
then
more
stairs
And
then
his
voice
sank
even
lower
tunnel
dark
tunnel
and
last
little
cleft
and
path
high
above
the
main
pass
was
that
way
that
Smeéagol
got
out
the
darkness
But
was
years
ago
The
path
may
have
vanished
now
but
perhaps
not
perhaps
not
don
like
the
sound
all
said
Sam
Sounds
too
easy
any
rate
the
telling
that
path
still
there
guarded
too
Wasn
guarded
Gollum
said
this
caught
fancied
caught
green
gleam
Gollum
eye
Gollum
muttered
but
did
not
reply
not
guarded
asked
Frodo
sternly
And
did
you
escape
out
the
darkness
Sméagol
Were
you
not
rather
permitted
depart
upon
errand
That
least
what
Aragorn
thought
who
found
you
the
Dead
Marshes
some
years
ago
lie
hissed
Gollum
and
evil
light
came
into
his
eyes
the
naming
Aragorn
lied
yes
did
did
escape
all
poor
self
Indeed
was
told
seek
for
the
Precious
and
have
searched
and
searched
course
have
But
not
for
the
Black
One
The
Precious
was
ours
was
mine
tell
you
did
escape
Frodo
felt
strange
certainty
that
this
matter
Gollum
was
for
once
not
far
from
the
truth
might
suspected
that
had
somehow
found
way
out
Mordor
and
least
believed
that
was
his
own
cunning
For
one
thing
noted
that
Gollum
used
and
that
seemed
usually
sign
its
rare
appearances
that
some
remnants
old
truth
and
sincerity
were
for
the
moment
top
But
even
Gollum
could
trusted
this
point
Frodo
did
not
forget
the
wiles
the
Enemy
The
escape
may
have
been
allowed
arranged
and
well
known
the
Dark
Tower
And
any
case
Gollum
was
plainly
keeping
good
deal
back
ask
you
again
said
not
this
secret
way
guarded
But
the
name
Aragorn
had
put
Gollum
into
sullen
mood
had
all
the
injured
air
liar
suspected
when
for
once
has
told
the
truth
part
did
not
answer
not
guarded
Frodo
repeated
Yes
yes
perhaps
safe
places
this
country
said
Gollum
sulkily
safe
places
But
master
must
try
home
other
way
They
could
not
get
him
say
more
The
name
the
perilous
place
and
the
high
pass
could
not
tell
would
not
644
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Its
name
was
Cirith
Ungol
name
dreadful
rumour
Aragorn
could
perhaps
have
told
them
that
name
and
its
significance
Gandalf
would
have
warned
them
But
they
were
alone
and
Aragorn
was
far
away
and
Gandalf
stood
amid
the
ruin
Isengard
and
strove
with
Saruman
delayed
treason
Yet
even
spoke
his
last
words
Saruman
and
the
palantir
crashed
fire
upon
the
steps
Orthanc
his
thought
was
ever
upon
Frodo
and
Samwise
over
the
long
leagues
his
mind
sought
for
them
hope
and
pity
Maybe
Frodo
felt
not
knowing
had
upon
Amon
Hen
even
though
believed
that
Gandalf
was
gone
gone
for
ever
into
the
shadow
Moria
far
away
sat
upon
the
ground
for
long
while
silent
his
head
bowed
striving
recall
all
that
Gandalf
had
said
him
But
for
this
choice
could
recall
counsel
Indeed
Gandalf
guidance
had
been
taken
from
them
too
soon
too
soon
while
the
Dark
Land
was
still
very
far
away
How
they
should
enter
the
last
Gandalf
had
not
said
Perhaps
could
not
say
Into
the
stronghold
the
Enemy
the
North
into
Dol
Guldur
had
once
ventured
But
into
Mordor
the
Mountain
Fire
and
Barad
dtr
since
the
Dark
Lord
rose
power
again
had
ever
journeyed
there
Frodo
did
not
think
And
here
was
little
halfling
from
the
Shire
simple
hobbit
the
quiet
countryside
expected
find
way
where
the
great
ones
could
not
dared
not
was
evil
fate
But
had
taken
himself
his
own
sitting
room
the
far
off
spring
another
year
remote
now
that
was
like
chapter
story
the
world
youth
when
the
Trees
Silver
and
Gold
were
still
bloom
This
was
evil
choice
Which
way
should
choose
And
both
led
terror
and
death
what
good
lay
choice
The
day
drew
deep
silence
fell
upon
the
little
grey
hollow
where
they
lay
near
the
borders
the
land
fear
silence
that
could
felt
were
thick
veil
that
cut
them
off
from
all
the
world
about
them
Above
them
was
dome
pale
sky
barred
with
fleeting
smoke
but
seemed
high
and
far
away
seen
through
great
deeps
air
heavy
with
brooding
thought
Not
even
eagle
poised
against
the
sun
would
have
marked
the
hobbits
sitting
there
under
the
weight
doom
silent
not
moving
shrouded
their
thin
grey
cloaks
For
moment
might
have
paused
consider
Gollum
tiny
figure
sprawling
the
ground
there
perhaps
lay
the
famished
skeleton
some
child
Men
its
ragged
garment
still
clinging
its
long
arms
and
legs
almost
bone
white
and
bone
thin
flesh
worth
peck
Frodo
head
was
bowed
over
his
knees
but
Sam
leaned
back
with
hands
behind
his
head
staring
out
his
hood
the
empty
sky
THE
BLACK
GATE
CLOSED
645
least
for
long
while
was
empty
Then
presently
Sam
thought
saw
dark
bird
like
figure
wheel
into
the
circle
his
sight
and
hover
and
then
wheel
away
again
Two
more
followed
and
then
fourth
They
were
very
small
look
yet
knew
somehow
that
they
were
huge
with
vast
stretch
pinion
flying
great
height
covered
his
eyes
and
bent
forward
cowering
The
same
warning
fear
was
him
had
felt
the
presence
the
Black
Riders
the
helpless
horror
that
had
come
with
the
cry
the
wind
and
the
shadow
the
moon
though
now
was
not
crushing
compel
ling
the
menace
was
more
remote
But
menace
was
Frodo
felt
too
His
thought
was
broken
stirred
and
shivered
but
did
not
look
Gollum
huddled
himself
together
like
cornered
spider
The
winged
shapes
wheeled
and
stooped
swiftly
down
speeding
back
Mordor
Sam
took
deep
breath
The
Riders
are
about
again
the
air
said
hoarse
whisper
saw
them
you
think
they
could
see
They
were
very
high
And
they
are
Black
Riders
same
before
then
they
can
see
much
daylight
can
they
perhaps
not
said
Frodo
But
their
steeds
could
see
And
these
winged
creatures
that
they
ride
now
they
can
probably
see
more
than
any
other
creature
They
are
like
great
carrion
birds
They
are
looking
for
something
the
Enemy
the
watch
fear
The
feeling
dread
passed
but
the
enfolding
silence
was
broken
For
some
time
they
had
been
cut
off
from
the
world
invisible
island
now
they
were
laid
bare
again
peril
had
returned
But
still
Frodo
did
not
speak
Gollum
make
his
choice
His
eyes
were
closed
were
dreaming
looking
inward
into
his
heart
and
memory
last
stirred
and
stood
and
seemed
that
was
about
speak
and
decide
But
hark
said
What
that
new
fear
was
upon
them
They
heard
singing
and
hoarse
shout
ing
first
seemed
long
way
off
but
drew
nearer
was
coming
towards
them
leaped
into
all
their
minds
that
the
Black
Wings
had
spied
them
and
had
sent
armed
soldiers
seize
them
speed
seemed
too
great
for
these
terrible
servants
Sauron
They
crouched
listening
The
voices
and
the
clink
weapons
and
harness
were
very
close
Frodo
and
Sam
loosened
their
small
swords
their
sheaths
Flight
was
impossible
Gollum
rose
slowly
and
crawled
insect
like
the
lip
the
hollow
Very
cautiously
raised
himself
inch
inch
until
could
peer
over
between
two
broken
points
stone
remained
there
with
out
moving
for
some
time
making
sound
Presently
the
voices
began
recede
again
and
then
they
slowly
faded
away
Far
off
646
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
horn
blew
the
ramparts
the
Morannon
Then
quietly
Gollum
drew
back
and
slipped
down
into
the
hollow
More
Men
going
Mordor
said
low
voice
Dark
faces
have
not
seen
Men
like
these
before
Sméagol
has
not
They
are
fierce
They
have
black
eyes
and
long
black
hair
and
gold
rings
their
ears
yes
lots
beautiful
gold
And
some
have
red
paint
their
cheeks
and
red
cloaks
and
their
flags
are
red
and
the
tips
their
spears
and
they
have
round
shields
yellow
and
black
with
big
spikes
Not
nice
very
cruel
wicked
Men
they
look
Almost
bad
Orcs
and
much
bigger
Sméagol
thinks
they
have
come
out
the
South
beyond
the
Great
River
end
they
came
that
road
They
have
passed
the
Black
Gate
but
more
may
follow
Always
more
people
coming
Mordor
One
day
all
the
peoples
will
inside
Were
there
any
oliphaunts
asked
Sam
forgetting
his
fear
his
eagerness
for
news
strange
places
oliphaunts
What
are
oliphaunts
said
Gollum
Sam
stood
putting
his
hands
behind
his
back
always
did
when
speaking
poetry
and
began
Grey
mouse
Big
house
Nose
like
snake
make
the
earth
shake
tramp
through
the
grass
Trees
crack
pass
With
horns
mouth
walk
the
South
Flapping
big
ears
Beyond
count
years
stump
round
and
round
Never
lie
the
ground
Not
even
die
Oliphaunt
Biggest
all
Huge
old
and
tall
ever
you

Not

HERBS
AND
STEWED
RABBIT
For
the
few
hours
daylight
that
were
left
they
rested
shifting
into
the
shade
the
sun
moved
until
last
the
shadow
the
western
rim
their
dell
grew
long
and
darkness
filled
all
the
hollow
Then
they
ate
little
and
drank
sparingly
Gollum
ate
nothing
but
accepted
water
gladly
Soon
get
more
now
said
licking
his
lips
Good
water
runs
down
streams
the
Great
River
nice
water
the
lands
are
going
Sméagol
will
get
food
there
too
perhaps
very
hungry
yes
gollum
set
his
two
large
flat
hands
his
shrunken
belly
and
pale
green
light
came
into
his
eyes
The
dusk
was
deep
when
length
they
set
out
creeping
over
the
westward
rim
the
dell
and
fading
like
ghosts
into
the
broken
country
the
borders
the
road
The
moon
was
now
three
nights
from
the
full
but
did
not
climb
over
the
mountains
until
nearly
midnight
and
the
early
night
was
very
dark
single
red
light
burned
high
the
Towers
the
Teeth
but
otherwise
sign
could
seen
heard
the
sleepless
watch
the
Morannon
For
many
miles
the
red
eye
seemed
stare
them
they
fled
stumbling
through
barren
stony
country
They
did
not
dare
take
the
road
but
they
kept
their
left
following
its
line
well
they
could
little
distance
last
when
night
was
growing
old
and
they
were
already
weary
for
they
had
taken
only
one
short
rest
the
eye
dwindled
small
fiery
point
and
then
vanished
they
had
turned
the
dark
northern
shoulder
the
lower
mountains
and
were
heading
southwards
With
hearts
strangely
lightened
they
now
rested
again
but
not
for
long
They
were
not
going
quick
enough
for
Gollum
his
reckoning
was
nearly
thirty
leagues
from
the
Morannon
the
Cross
roads
above
Osgiliath
and
hoped
cover
that
distance
four
journeys
soon
they
struggled
once
more
until
the
dawn
began
spread
slowly
the
wide
grey
solitude
They
had
then
walked
almost
eight
leagues
and
the
hobbits
could
not
have
gone
any
further
even
they
had
dared
HERBS
AND
STEWED
RABBIT
649
The
growing
light
revealed
them
land
already
less
barren
and
ruinous
The
mountains
still
loomed
ominously
their
left
but
near
hand
they
could
see
the
southward
road
now
bearing
away
from
the
black
roots
the
hills
and
slanting
westwards
Beyond
were
slopes
covered
with
sombre
trees
like
dark
clouds
but
all
about
them
lay
tumbled
heathland
grown
with
ling
and
broom
and
cornel
and
other
shrubs
that
they
did
not
know
Here
and
there
they
saw
knots
tall
pine
trees
The
hearts
the
hobbits
rose
again
little
spite
weariness
the
air
was
fresh
and
fragrant
and
reminded
them
the
uplands
the
Northfarthing
far
away
seemed
good
reprieved
walk
land
that
had
only
been
for
few
years
under
the
dominion
the
Dark
Lord
and
was
not
yet
fallen
wholly
into
decay
But
they
did
not
forget
their
danger
nor
the
Black
Gate
that
was
still
all
too
near
hidden
though
was
behind
the
gloomy
heights
They
looked
about
for
hiding
place
where
they
could
shel
ter
from
evil
eyes
while
the
light
lasted
The
day
passed
uneasily
They
lay
deep
the
heather
and
counted
out
the
slow
hours
which
there
seemed
little
change
for
they
were
still
under
the
shadows
the
Ephel
Duath
and
the
sun
was
veiled
Frodo
slept
times
deeply
and
peacefully
either
trusting
Gollum
too
tired
trouble
about
him
but
Sam
found
difficult
more
than
doze
even
when
Gollum
was
plainly
fast
asleep
whiffling
and
twitching
his
secret
dreams
Hunger
perhaps
more
than
mistrust
kept
him
wakeful
had
begun
long
for
good
homely
meal
something
hot
out
the
pot
soon
the
land
faded
into
formless
grey
under
coming
night
they
started
out
again
little
while
Gollum
led
them
down
the
southward
road
and
after
that
they
went
more
quickly
though
the
danger
was
greater
Their
ears
were
strained
for
the
sound
hoof
foot
the
road
ahead
following
them
from
behind
but
the
night
passed
and
they
heard
sound
walker
rider
The
road
had
been
made
long
lost
time
and
for
perhaps
thirty
miles
below
the
Morannon
had
been
newly
repaired
but
went
south
the
wild
encroached
upon
The
handiwork
Men
old
could
still
seen
its
straight
sure
flight
and
level
course
now
and
again
cut
its
way
through
hillside
slopes
leaped
over
stream
upon
wide
shapely
arch
enduring
masonry
but
last
all
signs
stonework
faded
save
for
broken
pillar
here
and
there
peering
out
bushes
the
side
old
paving
stones
still
lurking
amid
weeds
and
moss
Heather
and
trees
and
bracken
scrambled
down
and
overhung

over
the
surface

THE

THE
RINGS
wind
held
its
own
sure
course
and
guided
them
the
swiftest
way
they
passed
into
the
northern
marches
that
land
that
Men
once
called
Ithilien
fair
country
climbing
woods
and
swift
falling
streams
The
night
became
fine
under
star
and
round
moon
and
seemed
the
hobbits
that
the
fragrance
the
air
grew
they
went
forward
and
from
the
blowing
and
muttering
Gollum
seemed
that
noticed
too
and
did
not
relish
the
first
signs
day
they
halted
again
They
had
come
the
end
long
cutting
deep
and
sheer
sided
the
middle
which
the
road
clove
its
way
through
stony
ridge
Now
they
climbed
the
westward
bank
and
looked
abroad
Day
was
opening
the
sky
and
they
saw
that
the
mountains
were
now
much
further
off
receding
eastward
long
curve
that
was
lost
the
distance
Before
them
they
turned
west
gentle
slopes
ran
down
into
dim
hazes
far
below
All
about
them
were
small
woods
resinous
trees
fir
and
cedar
and
cypress
and
other
kinds
unknown
the
Shire
with
wide
glades
among
them
and
everywhere
there
was
wealth
sweet
smelling
herbs
and
shrubs
The
long
journey
from
Rivendell
had
brought
them
far
south
their
own
land
but
not
until
now
this
more
sheltered
region
had
the
hobbits
felt
the
change
clime
Here
Spring
was
already
busy
about
them
fronds
pierced
moss
and
mould
larches
were
green
fingered
small
flowers
were
opening
the
turf
birds
were
singing
Ithilien
the
garden
Gondor
now
desolate
kept
still
dishevelled
dryad
loveliness
South
and
west
looked
towards
the
warm
lower
vales
Anduin
shielded
from
the
east
the
Ephel
Duath
and
yet
not
under
the
mountain
shadow
protected
from
the
north
the
Emyn
Muil
open
the
southern
airs
and
the
moist
winds
from
the
Sea
far
away
Many
great
trees
grew
there
planted
long
ago
falling
into
untended
age
amid
riot
careless
descendants
and
groves
and
thickets
there
were
tamarisk
and
pungent
terebinth
olive
and
bay
and
there
were
junipers
and
myrtles
and
thymes
that
grew
bushes
with
their
woody
creeping
stems
mantled
deep
tapestries
the
hidden
stones
sages
many
kinds
putting
forth
blue
flowers
red
pale
green
and
marjorams
and
new
sprouting
parsleys
and
many
herbs
forms
and
scents
beyond
the
garden

Sam
The
grots
and
rocky
walls
were
already
starred
with
saxifrages
and
stonecrops
Primeroles
and
anemones
were
awake
the
filbert
brakes
and
asphodel
and
many
lily
flowers
nodded
their
half
opened
heads
the
grass
deep
green
grass
beside
the
pools
where
falling
streams
halted
cool

down

The

turned
their
backs
the

and

HERBS

RABBIT
651
they
walked
brushing
their
way
through
bush
and
herb
sweet
odours
rose
about
them
Gollum
coughed
and
retched
but
the
hob
bits
breathed
deep
and
suddenly
Sam
laughed
for
heart
ease
not
for
jest
They
followed
stream
that
went
quickly
down
before
them
Presently
brought
them
small
clear
lake
shallow
dell
lay
the
broken
ruins
ancient
stone
basin
the
carven
rim
which
was
almost
wholly
covered
with
mosses
and
rose
brambles
iris
swords
stood
ranks
about
and
water
lily
leaves
floated
its
dark
gently
rippling
surface
but
was
deep
and
fresh
and
spilled
ever
softly
out
over
stony
lip
the
far
end
Here
they
washed
themselves
and
drank
their
fill
the
falling
freshet
Then
they
sought
for
resting
place
and
hiding
place
for
this
land
fair
seeming
still
was
nonetheless
now
territory
the
Enemy
They
had
not
come
very
far
from
the
road
and
yet
even
short
space
they
had
seen
scars
the
old
wars
and
the
newer
wounds
made
the
Orcs
and
other
foul
servants
the
Dark
Lord
pit
uncovered
filth
and
refuse
trees
hewn
down
wantonly
and
left
die
with
evil
runes
the
fell
sign
the
Eye
cut
rude
strokes
their
bark
Sam
scrambling
below
the
outfall
the
lake
smelling
and
touch
ing
the
unfamiliar
plants
and
trees
forgetful
for
the
moment
Mordor
was
reminded
suddenly
their
ever
present
peril
stumbled
ring
still
scorched
fire
and
the
midst
found
pile
charred
and
broken
bones
and
skulls
The
swift
growth
the
wild
with
briar
and
eglantine
and
trailing
clematis
was
already
drawing
veil
over
this
place
dreadful
feast
and
slaughter
but
was
not
ancient
hurried
back
his
companions
but
said
nothing
the
bones
were
best
left
peace
and
not
pawed
and
routed
Gollum
Let
find
place
lie
said
Not
lower
down
Higher
for
little
way
back
above
the
lake
they
found
deep
brown
bed
last
year
fern
Beyond
was
thicket
dark
leaved
bay
trees
climbing
steep
bank
that
was
crowned
with
old
cedars
Here
they
decided
rest
and
pass
the
day
which
already
promised
bright
and
warm
good
day
for
strolling
their
way
along
the
groves
and
glades
Ithilien
but
though
Orcs
may
shun
the
sunlight
there
were
too
many
places
here
where
they
could
lie
hid
and
watch
and
other
evil
eyes
were
abroad
Sauron
had
many
servants
Gollum
any
case
would
not
move
under
the
Yellow
Face
Soon
would
look
over
the
dark
ridges
the
Ephel
Duath
and
would
faint
and
cower
the
light
and
heat
Sam
had
been
giving
earnest
thought

they
marched
652
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Now
that
the
despair
the
impassable
Gate
was
behind
him
did
not
feel
inclined
his
master
take
thought
for
their
livelihood
beyond
the
end
their
errand
and
anyway
seemed
wiser
him
save
the
waybread
the
Elves
for
worse
times
ahead
Six
days
more
had
passed
since
reckoned
that
they
had
only
bare
supply
for
three
weeks
reach
the
Fire
that
time
lucky
this
rate
thought
And
might
wanting
get
back
might
Besides
the
end
long
night
march
and
after
bathing
and
drinking
felt
even
more
hungry
than
usual
supper
break
fast
the
fire
the
old
kitchen
Bagshot
Row
was
what
really
wanted
idea
struck
him
and
turned
Gollum
Gollum
had
just
begun
sneak
off
his
own
and
was
crawling
away
all
fours
through
the
fern
Gollum
said
Sam
Where
are
you
going
Hunting
Well
see
here
old
noser
you
don
like
our
food
and
not
sorry
for
change
myself
Your
new
motto
always
ready
help
Could
you
find
anything
fit
for
hungry
hobbit
Yes
perhaps
yes
said
Gollum
Sméagol
always
helps
they
asks
they
asks
nicely
Right
said
Sam
does
ask
And
that
isn
nice
enough
begs
Gollum
disappeared
was
away
some
time
and
Frodo
after
few
mouthfuls
Jembas
settled
deep
into
the
brown
fern
and
went
sleep
Sam
looked
him
The
early
daylight
was
only
just
creeping
down
into
the
shadows
under
the
trees
but
saw
his
master
face
very
clearly
and
his
hands
too
lying
rest
the
ground
beside
him
was
reminded
suddenly
Frodo
had
lain
asleep
the
house
Elrond
after
his
deadly
wound
Then
had
kept
watch
Sam
had
noticed
that
times
light
seemed
shining
faintly
within
but
now
the
light
was
even
clearer
and
stronger
Frodo
face
was
peaceful
the
marks
fear
and
care
had
left
but
looked
old
old
and
beautiful
the
chiselling
the
shaping
years
was
now
revealed
many
fine
lines
that
had
before
been
hidden
though
the
identity
the
face
was
not
changed
Not
that
Sam
Gamgee
put
that
way
himself
shook
his
head
finding
words
useless
and
murmured
love
him
like
that
and
sometimes
shines
through
somehow
But
love
him
whether
Gollum
returned
quietly
and
peered
over
Sam
shoulder
Looking
Frodo
shut
his
eyes
and
crawled
away
without
sound
Sam
came
him
moment
later
and
found
him
chewing
something
and
muttering
himself
the
ground
beside
him
lay
two
small
rabbits
which
was
beginning
eye
greedily
HERBS

653
Sméagol
always
helps
said
has
brought
rabbits
nice
rabbits
But
master
has
gone
sleep
and
perhaps
Sam
wants
sleep
Doesn
want
rabbits
now
Sméagol
tries
help
but
can
catch
things
all
minute
Sam
however
had
objection
rabbit
all
and
said
least
not
cooked
rabbit
All
hobbits
course
can
cook
for
they
begin
learn
the
art
before
their
letters
which
many
never
reach
but
Sam
was
good
cook
even
hobbit
reckoning
and
had
done
good
deal
the
camp
cooking
their
travels
when
there
was
chance
still
hopefully
carried
some
his
gear
his
pack
small
tinder
box
two
small
shallow
pans
the
smaller
fitting
into
the
larger
inside
them
wooden
spoon
short
two
pronged
fork
and
some
skewers
were
stowed
and
hidden
the
bottom
the
pack
flat
wooden
box
dwindling
treasure
some
salt
But
needed
fire
and
other
things
besides
thought
for
bit
while
took
out
his
knife
cleaned
and
whetted
and
began
dress
the
rabbits
was
not
going
leave
Frodo
alone
asleep
even
for
few
minutes
Now
Gollum
said
another
job
for
you
and
fill
these
pans
with
water
and
bring
back
Sméagol
will
fetch
water
yes
said
Gollum
But
what
does
the
hobbit
want
all
that
water
for
has
drunk
has
washed
Never
you
mind
said
Sam
you
can
guess
you
soon
find
out
And
the
sooner
you
fetch
the
water
the
sooner
you
learn
Don
you
damage
one
pans
carve
you
into
mincemeat
While
Gollum
was
away
Sam
took
another
look
Frodo
was
still
sleeping
quietly
but
Sam
was
now
struck
most
the
leanness
his
face
and
hands
Too
thin
and
drawn
muttered
Not
right
for
hobbit
can
get
these
coneys
cooked
going
wake
him
Sam
gathered
pile
the
driest
fern
and
then
scrambled
the
bank
collecting
bundle
twigs
and
broken
wood
the
fallen
branch
cedar
the
top
gave
him
good
supply
cut

stooping
over

with

when
Gollum
returned
carrying
the
pans
carefully
and
grumbling
himself
set
the
pans
down
and
then
suddenly
saw
what
Sam
was
doing
gave
thin
hissing
shriek
and
seemed
both
frightened
and
angry
Ach

Gollum
withdrew
grumbling
and
crawled
into
the
fern
Sam
busied
himself
with
his
pans
What

said
himself
some
herbs
and

Sam
sleep
the
end
had
find
what
wanted
for
himself
but
did
not
have
far
not
out
sight
the
place
where
his
master
lay
still
sleeping
For
while
Sam
sat
musing
and
tending
the
fire
till
the
water
boiled
The
daylight
grew
and
the
air
became
warm
the
dew
faded
off
turf
and
leaf
Soon
the
rabbits
cut
lay
simmering
their
pans
with
the
bunched
herbs
Almost
Sam
fell
asleep
the
time
went
let
them
stew
for
close
hour
testing
them
now
and
again
with
his
fork
and
tasting
the
broth
When
thought
all
was
ready
lifted
the
pans
off
the
fire
and
crept
along
Frodo
Frodo
half
opened
his
eyes
Sam
stood
over
him
and
then
wakened
from
his
dreaming
another
gentle
unre
coverable
dream
peace
Hullo
Sam
said
Not
resting
anything
wrong
What
the
time
About
couple
hours
after
daybreak
said
Sam
and
nigh
half
past
eight
Shire
clocks
maybe
But
nothing
wrong
Though
ain
quite
what
call
right
stock
onions
taters
got
bit
stew
for
you
and
some

Frodo
you
good
You
have
sup
your

straight
from
the
pan
when
cooled
bit
haven
brought
bowls
nor
nothing
proper
Frodo
yawned
and
stretched
You
should
have
been
resting
Sam
said
And
lighting
fire
was
dangerous
these
parts
But
feel
hungry
Hmm
Can
smell
from
here
What
have
you
stewed
present
from
Sméagol
said
Sam
brace
young
coneys
though
fancy
Gollum
regretting
them
now
But
there
naught
with
them
but
few
herbs
Sam
and
his
master
sat
just
within
the
fern
brake
and
ate
their
stew
from
the
pans
sharing
the
old
fork
and
spoon
They
allowed
them
selves
half
piece
the
Elvish
waybread
each
seemed
feast
Wheew
Gollum
Sam
called
and
whistled
softly
Come
Still

There

There

said
Sam
And
then
you
must
take

said
Frodo
Don

Frodo

Not

now

not

with

precious
not

all
They
finished
and
Sam
went
off
the
stream
rinse
his
gear
stood
return
looked
back
the
slope
that
moment
saw
the
sun
rise
out
the
reek
haze
dark
shadow
whatever
was
that
lay
ever
the
east
and
sent
its
golden
beams
down
upon
the
trees
and
glades
about
him
Then
noticed
thin
spiral
blue
grey
smoke
plain
see
caught
the
sunlight
rising
from
thicket
above
him
With
shock
realized
that
this
was
the
smoke
from
his
little
cooking
fire
which
had
neglected
put
out
That
won
Never
thought
would
show
like
that
mut
tered
and
started
hurry
back
Suddenly
halted
and
listened
Had
heard
whistle
not
was
the
call
some
strange
bird
was
whistle
did
not
come
from
Frodo
direction
There
went
again
from
another
place
Sam
began
run
well
could
uphill
found
that
small
brand
burning
away
its
outer
end
had
kindled
some
fern
the
edge
the
fire
and
the
fern
blazing
had
set
the
turves
smouldering
Hastily
stamped
out
what
was
left
the
fire
scattered
the
ashes
and
laid
the
turves
the
hole
Then
crept
back
Frodo
Did
you
hear
whistle
and
what
sounded
like
answer
asked
few
minutes
back
hope
was
only
bird
but
didn
sound
quite
like
that
more
like
somebody
mimicking
bird
call
thought
And
afraid
bit
fire
been
smoking
Now
gone
and
brought
trouble
never
forgive
myself
Nor
won
have
chance
maybe
Hush
whispered
Frodo
thought
heard
voices
The
two
hobbits
trussed
their
small
packs
put
them
ready
for
flight
and
then
crawled
deeper
into
the
fern
There
they
crouched
listening
There
was
doubt
the
voices
They
were
speaking
low
and
furtively
but
they
were
near
and
coming
nearer
Then
quite
suddenly
one
spoke
clearly
close
hand
Here
Here
where
the
smoke
came
from
said
Twill
nigh

doubt

Then
shall
learn
what
kind

Aye
and

said
second
voice
once
four
men
came
striding
through
the
fern
from
different
directions
Since
flight
and
hiding
were
longer
possible

and
Sam
sprang
their
feet
putting
back
back
and
whipping
out
their
small
swords
they
were
astonished
what
they
saw
their
captors
were
even
more
astonished
Four
tall
Men
stood
there
Two
had
spears
their
hands
with
broad
bright
heads
Two
had
great
bows
almost
their
own
height
and
great
quivers
long
green
feathered
arrows
All
had
swords
their
sides
and
were

green
and
brown
varied
hues
the

the

Ithilien
Green
gauntlets
covered
their

and
their

were
hooded
and
masked
with

except
for
their
eyes
which
were
very
keen
and
bright

Frodo

doubtfully
Nay

Elves

And
Elves

Meaning

said
Sam
Thank
you
kindly
And
when
you
finished
discussing
perhaps
you
say
who
you
are
and
why
you
can
let
two
tired
travellers
rest
The
tall
green
man
laughed
grimly
Faramir
Captain
Gondor
said
But
there
are

only
the
servants

Dark

But

Frodo
And
travellers

Then

Boromir
all
the

exclaimed
Boromir

Faramir
and
strange
stern
look
came
into
his
face
You

with
him
That
news
indeed
true
Know
little

that
Boromir

Who

Are

Frodo

Seek

The

said
Faramir
astonishment
some

that

Aragorn

Frodo
And

And

Doubtless

Faramir
and

Wise

Think

Faramir

The

sat
down
again

Close

659
shadow
the
dark
bay
trees
two
men
remained
guard
They
took
off
their
masks
now
and
again
cool
them
the
day
heat
grew
and
Frodo
saw
that
they
were
goodly
men
pale
skinned
dark
hair
with
grey
eyes
and
faces
sad
and
proud
They
spoke
together
soft
voices
first
using
the
Common
Speech
but
after
the
manner
older
days
and
then
changing
another
language
their
own
his
amazement
listened
Frodo
became
aware
that
was
the
elven
tongue
that
they
spoke
one
but
little
different
and
looked
them
with
wonder
for
knew
then
that
they
must
Dunedain
the
South
men
the
line
the
Lords
Westernesse
After
while
spoke
them
but
they
were
slow
and
cautious
answering
They
named
themselves
Mablung
and
Damrod
sol
diers
Gondor
and
they
were
Rangers
Ithilien
for
they
were
descended
from
folk
who
lived
Ithilien
one
time
before
was
overrun
From
such
men
the
Lord
Denethor
chose
his
forayers
who
crossed
the
Anduin
secretly
how
where
they
would
not
say
harry
the
Orcs
and
other
enemies
that
roamed
between
the
Ephel
Duath
and
the
River
close
ten
leagues
hence
the
east
shore
Anduin
said
Mablung
and
seldom
come
far
afield
But
have
new
errand
this
journey
come
ambush
the
Men
Harad
Curse
them
Aye
curse
the
Southrons
said
Damrod
Tis
said
that
there
were
dealings
old
between
Gondor
and
the
kingdoms
the
Harad
the
Far
South
though
there
was
never
friendship
those
days
our
bounds
were
away
south
beyond
the
mouths
Anduin
and
Umbar
the
nearest
their
realms
acknowledged
our
sway
But
that
long
since
Tis
many
lives
Men
since
any
passed
fro
between
Now
late
have
learned
that
the
Enemy
has
been
among
them
and
they
are
gone
over
Him
back
Him
they
were
ever
ready
His
will
have
many
also
the
East
doubt
not
that
the
days
Gondor
are
numbered
and
the
walls
Minas
Tirith
are
doomed
great
His
strength
and
malice
But
still
will
not
sit
idle
and
let
Him
all
would
said
Mablung
These
cursed
Southrons
come
now
marching
the
ancient
roads
swell
the
hosts
the
Dark
Tower
Yea
the
very
roads
that
craft
Gondor
made
And
they
ever
more
heedlessly
learn
thinking
that
the
power
their
new
master
great
enough
that
the
mere
shadow
His
hills
will
protect
them
come
teach
them
another
lesson
Great
strength
them
was
reported
some
days
ago
marching
north
One
their
regiments
due
our
reckoning
pass
some
time
ere
noon
the
road
above
where
passes
through
the
cloven
way
The
road
may
pass
but
they
shall
not
Not
while
Faramir
Captain
leads
now
all
perilous
660
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
ventures
But
his
life
charmed
fate
spares
him
for
some
other
end
Their
talk
died
down
into
listening
silence
All
seemed
still
and
watchful
Sam
crouched
the
edge
the
fern
brake
peered
out
With
his
keen
hobbit
eyes
saw
that
many
more
Men
were
about
could
see
them
stealing
the
slopes
singly
long
files
keeping
always
the
shade
grove
thicket
crawling
hardly
visible
their
brown
and
green
raiment
through
grass
and
brake
All
were
hooded
and
masked
and
had
gauntlets
their
hands
and
were
armed
like
Faramir
and
his
companions
Before
long
they
had
all
passed
and
vanished
The
sun
rose
till
neared
the
South
The
shadows
shrank
wonder
where
that
dratted
Gollum
thought
Sam
crawled
back
into
deeper
shade
stands

Yellow

But
fancy
look
after
himself
lay
down
beside
Frodo
and
began
doze
woke
thinking
that
had
heard
horns
blowing
sat
was
now
high
noon
The
guards
stood
alert
and
tense
the
shadow
the
trees
Suddenly
the
horns
rang
out
louder
and
beyond
mistake
from
above
over
the
top
the
slope
Sam
thought
that
heard
cries
and
wild
shouting
also
but
the
sound
was
faint
came
out
some
distant
cave
Then
presently
the
noise
fighting
broke
out
near
hand
just
above
their
hiding
place
could
hear
plainly
the
ringing
grate
steel
steel
the
clang
sword
iron
cap
the
dull
beat
blade
shield
men
were
yelling
and
screaming
and
one
clear
loud
voice
was
calling
Gondor
Gondor
sounds
like
hundred
blacksmiths
all
smithying
together
said
Sam
Frodo
They
near
want
them
now
But
the
noise
grew
closer
They
are
coming
cried
Damrod
See
Some
the
Southrons
have
broken
from
the
trap
and
are
flying
from
the
road
There
they
Our
men
after
them
and
the
Captain
leading
Sam
eager
see
more
went
now
and
joined
the
guards
scrambled
little
way
into
one
the
larger
the
bay
trees
For
moment
caught
glimpse
swarthy
men
red
running
down
the
slope
some
way
off
with
green
clad
warriors
leaping
after
them
hewing
them
down
they
fled
Arrows
were
thick
the
air
Then
suddenly
straight
over
the
rim
their
sheltering
bank
man
fell
crashing
through
the
slender
trees
nearly
top
them
came
rest
the
fern
few
feet
away
face
downward
green
arrow
feathers
sticking
from
his
neck
below
golden
collar
His
scarlet
robes
were
HERBS
AND
STEWED
RABBIT
661
tattered
his
corslet
overlapping
brazen
plates
was
rent
and
hewn
his
black
plaits
hair
braided
with
gold
were
drenched
with
blood
His
brown
hand
still
clutched
the
hilt
broken
sword
was
Sam
first
view
battle
Men
against
Men
and
did
not
like
much
was
glad
that
could
not
see
the
dead
face
wondered
what
the
man
name
was
and
where
came
from
and
was
really
evil
heart
what
lies
threats
had
led
him
the
long
march
from
his
home
and
would
not
really
rather
have
stayed
there
peace
all
flash
thought
which
was
quickly
driven
from
his
mind
For
just
Mablung
stepped
towards
the
fallen
body
there
was
new
noise
Great
crying
and
shouting
Amidst
Sam
heard
shrill
bellowing
trumpeting
And
then
great
thudding
and
bumping
like
huge
rams
dinning
the
ground
Ware
Ware
cried
Damrod
his
companion
May
the
Valar
turn
him
aside
Mimak
Mtmak
his
astonishment
and
terror
and
lasting
delight
Sam
saw
vast
shape
crash
out
the
trees
and
come
careering
down
the
slope
Big
house
much
bigger
than
house
looked
him
grey
clad
moving
hill
Fear
and
wonder
maybe
enlarged
him
the
hobbit
eyes
but
the
MGmak
Harad
was
indeed
beast
vast
bulk
and
the
like
him
does
not
walk
now
Middle
earth
his
kin
that
live
still
latter
days
are
but
memories
his
girth
and
majesty
came
straight
towards
the
watchers
and
then
swerved
aside
the
nick
time
passing
only
few
yards
away
rocking
the
ground
beneath
their
feet
his
great
legs
like
trees
enormous
sail
like
ears
spread
out
long
snout
upraised
like
huge
serpent
about
strike
his
small
red
eyes
raging
His
upturned
hornlike
tusks
were
bound
with
bands
gold
and
dripped
with
blood
His
trappings
scarlet
and
gold
flapped
about
him
wild
tatters
The
ruins
what
seemed
very
war
tower
lay
upon
his
heaving
back
smashed
his
furious
passage
through
the
woods
and
high
upon
his
neck
still
desperately
clung
tiny
figure
the
body
mighty
warrior
giant
among
the
Swertings
the
great
beast
thundered
blundering
blind
wrath
through
pool
and
thicket
Arrows
skipped
and
snapped
harmlessly
about
the
triple
hide
his
flanks
Men
both
sides
fled
before
him
but
many
overtook
and
crushed
the
ground
Soon
was
lost
view
still
trumpeting
and
stamping
far
away
What
became
him
Sam
never
heard
whether
escaped
roam
the
wild
for
time
until
perished
far
from
his
home
was
trapped
some
deep
pit
whether
raged
until
plunged
the
Great
River
and
was
swallowed

THE

Sam
drew
deep
breath
Oliphaunt
was
said
there
are
Oliphaunts
and
have
seen
one
What
life
But
one
home
will
ever
believe
Well
that
over
Ill
have
bit
sleep
Sleep

unhurt

Mablung
laughed

Chapter
THE
WINDOW
THE
WEST
seemed
Sam
that
had
only
dozed
for
few
minutes
when
awoke
find
that
was
late
afternoon
and
Faramir
had
come
back
had
brought
many
men
with
him
indeed
all
the
survivors
the
foray
were
now
gathered
the
slope
nearby
two
three
hundred
strong
They
sat
wide
semicircle
between
the
arms
which
Faramir
was
seated
the
ground
while
Frodo
stood
before
him
looked
strangely
like
the
trial
prisoner
Sam
crept
out
from
the
fern
but
one
paid
any
attention
him
and
placed
himself
the
end
the
rows
men
where
could
see
and
hear
all
that
was
going
watched
and
listened
intently
ready
dash
his
master
aid
needed
could
see
Faramir
face
which
was
now
unmasked
was
stern
and
command
ing
and
keen
wit
lay
behind
his
searching
glance
Doubt
was
the
grey
eyes
that
gazed
steadily
Frodo
Sam
soon
became
aware
that
the
Captain
was
not
satisfied
with
Frodo
account
himself
several
points
what
part
had
play
the
Company
that
set
out
from
Rivendell
why
had
left
Boromir
and
where
was
now
going
particular
returned
often
Isildur
Bane
Plainly
saw
that
Frodo
was
concealing
from
him
some
matter
great
importance
But
was
the
coming
the
Halfling
that
Isildur
Bane
should
waken
one
must
read
the
words
insisted
then
you
are
the
Halfling
that
was
named
doubtless
you
brought
this
thing
whatever
may
the
Council
which
you
speak
and
there
Boromir
saw
you
deny
Frodo
made
answer
said
Faramir
wish
then
learn
from
you
more
for
what
concerns
Boromir
concerns

But

and
the

Had
you
this

keeping

you
say
but
not
that
because
you

Frodo

And
the

murmur
astonishment
ran
through
all
the

men
Some
cried
aloud
The

Elendil
The
sword
Elendil
comes
Minas
Tirith
Great
tidings
But
Faramir
face
was
unmoved
Maybe
said
But
great
claim
will
need
established
and
clear
proofs
will
required
should
this
Aragorn
ever
come
Minas
Tirith
had
not
come
nor
any
your
Company
when
set
out
six
days
ago
Boromir
was
satisfied
that
claim
said
Frodo
Indeed
Boromir
were
here
would
answer
all
your
questions
And
since
was
already
Rauros
many
days
back
and
intended
then
straight
your
city
you
return
you
may
soon
learn
the
answers
there
part
the
Company
was
known
him
all
the
others
for
was
appointed
Elrond
Imladris
himself
before
the
whole
Council
that
errand
came
into
this
country
but
not
mine
reveal
any
outside
the
Company
Yet
those
who
claim
oppose
the
Enemy
would
well
not
hinder
Frodo
tone
was
proud
whatever
felt
and
Sam
approved
but
did
not
appease
Faramir
said
You
bid
mind
own
affairs
and
get
back
home
and
let
you
Boromir
will
tell
all
when
comes
When
comes
say
you
Were
you
friend
Boromir
Vividly
before
Frodo
mind
came
the
memory
Boromir
assault
upon
him
and
for
moment
hesitated
Faramir
eyes
watching
him
grew
harder
Boromir
was
valiant
member
our
Company
said
Frodo
length
Yes
was
his
friend
for
part
Faramir
smiled
grimly
Then
you
would
grieve
learn
that
Boromir
dead
would
grieve
indeed
said
Frodo
Then
catching
the
look
Faramir
eyes
faltered
Dead
said
you
mean
that
dead
and
that
you
knew
You
have
been
trying
trap
words
playing
with
are
you
now
trying
snare
with
falsehood
would
not
snare
even
orc
with
falsehood
said
Faramir
How
then
did
die
and
how
you
know
Since
you
say
that
none
the
Company
had
reached
the
city
when
you
left
the
manner
his
death
had
hoped
that
his
friend
and
companion
would
tell
how
was
But
was
alive
and
strong
when
parted
And
lives
still
for
all
that
know
Though
surely
there
are
many
perils
the
world
Many
indeed
said
Faramir
and
treachery
not
the
least
Sam
had
been
getting
more
and
more
impatient
and
angry
this
conversation
These
last
words
were
more
than
could
bear
and
THE
WINDOW
THE
WEST
665
bursting
into
the
middle
the
ring
strode
his
master
side
Begging
your
pardon
Frodo
said
but
this
has
gone
long
enough
right
talk
you
After
all
you
gone
through
much
for
his
good
and
all
these
great
Men
for
anyone
else
See
here
Captain
planted
himself
squarely
front
Faramir
his
hands
his
hips
and
look
his
face
was
addressing
young
hobbit
who
had
offered
him
what
called
sauce
when
questioned
about
visits
the
orchard
There
was
some
mur
muring
but
also
some
grins
the
faces
the
men
looking
the
sight
their
Captain
sitting
the
ground
and
eye
eye
with
young
hobbit
legs
well
apart
bristling
with
wrath
was
one
beyond
their
experience
See
here
said
What
are
you
driving
Let
come
the
point
before
all
the
Orcs
Mordor
come
down
you
think
master
murdered
this
Boromir
and
then
ran
away
you
got
sense
but
say
and
have
done
And
then
let
know
what
you
mean
about
But
pity
that
folk
talk
about
fighting
the
Enemy
can
let
others
their
bit
their
own
way
without
interfering
mighty
pleased
could
see
you
now
Think
got
new
friend
would
Patience
said
Faramir
but
without
anger
not
speak
before
your
master
whose
wit
greater
than
yours
And
not
need
any
teach
our
peril
Even
spare
brief
time
order
judge
justly
hard
matter
Were
hasty
you
might
have
slain
you
long
ago
For
commanded
slay
all
whom
find
this
land
without
the
leave
the
Lord
Gondor
But
not
slay
man
beast
needlessly
and
not
gladly
even
when
needed
Neither
talk
vain
comforted
Sit
your
master
and
silent
Sam
sat
down
heavily
with
red
face
Faramir
turned
Frodo
again
You
asked
how
know
that
the
son
Denethor
dead
Tidings
death
have
many
wings
Night
oft
brings
news
near
kindred
tis
said
Boromir
was
brother
shadow
sorrow
passed
over
his
face
you
remember
aught
special
mark
that
the
Lord
Boromir
bore
with
him
among
his
gear
Frodo
thought
for
moment
fearing
some
further
trap
and
wondering
how
this
debate
would
turn
the
end
had
hardly
saved
the
Ring
from
the
proud
grasp
Boromir
and
how
would
fare
now
among
many
men
warlike
and
strong
did
not
know
Yet
felt
his
heart
that
Faramir
though
was
much
like
his
brother
looks
was
man
less
self
regarding
both
sterner
and
wiser
remember
that
Boromir
bore
horn
said
last
You
remember
well
and
one
who
has
truth
seen
him
said
666
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Faramir
Then
maybe
you
can
see
your
mind
eye
great
horn
the
wild
the
East
bound
with
silver
and
written
with
ancient
characters
That
horn
the
eldest
son
our
house
has
borne
for
many
generations
and
said
that
blown
need
any
where
within
the
bounds
Gondor
the
realm
was
old
its
voice
will
not
pass
unheeded
Five
days
ere
set
out
this
venture
eleven
days
ago
about
this
hour
the
day
heard
the
blowing
that
horn
from
the
northward
seemed
but
dim
were
but
echo
the
mind
boding
ill
thought
father
and
for
tidings
had
heard
Boromir
since
went
away
and
watcher
our
borders
had
seen
him
pass
And
the
third
night
after
another
and
stranger
thing
befell
sat
night
the
waters
Anduin
the
grey
dark
under
the
young
pale
moon
watching
the
ever
moving
stream
and
the
sad
reeds
were
rustling
ever
watch
the
shores
nigh
Osgiliath
which
our
enemies
now
partly
hold
and
issue
from
harry
our
lands
But
that
night
all
the
world
slept
the
midnight
hour
Then
saw
seemed
that
saw
boat
floating
the
water
glimmering
grey
small
boat
strange
fashion
with
high
prow
and
there
was
none
row
steer
awe
fell
for
pale
light
was
round
But
rose
and
went
the
bank
and
began
walk
out
into
the
stream
for
was
drawn
towards
Then
the
boat
turned
towards
and
stayed
its
pace
and
floated
slowly
within
hand
reach
yet
durst
not
handle
waded
deep
were
heavily
burdened
and
seemed
passed
under
gaze
that
was
almost
filled
with
clear
water
from
which
came
the
light
and
lapped
the
water
warrior
lay
asleep
broken
sword
was
his
knee
saw
many
wounds
him
was
Boromir
brother
dead
knew
his
gear
his
sword
his
beloved
face
One
thing
only
missed
his
horn
One
thing
only
knew
not
fair
belt
were
linked
golden
leaves
about
his
waist
Boromir
cried
Where
thy
horn
Whither
goest
thou
Boromir
But
was
gone
The
boat
turned
into
the
stream
and
passed
glimmering
into
the
night
Dreamlike
was
and
yet
dream
for
there
was
waking
And
not
doubt
that
dead
and
has
passed
down
the
River
the
Sea
Alas
said
Frodo
That
was
indeed
Boromir
knew
him
For
the
golden
belt
was
given
him
Lothlorien
the
Lady
Galadriel
She
was
that
clothed
you
see
elven
grey
This
brooch
the
same
workmanship
touched
the
green
and
silver
leaf
that
fastened
his
cloak
beneath
his
throat
THE
WINDOW
THE
WEST
667
Faramir
looked
closely
beautiful
said
Yes
tis
work
the
same
craft
then
you
passed
through
the
Land
Lorien
Laurelindorenan
was
named
old
but
long
now
has
lain
beyond
the
knowledge
Men
added
softly
regarding
Frodo
with
new
wonder
his
eyes
Much
that
was
strange
about
you
begin
now
understand
Will
you
not
tell
more
For
bitter
thought
that
Boromir
died
within
sight
the
land
his
home
more
can
say
than
have
said
answered
Frodo
Though
your
tale
fills
with
foreboding
vision
was
that
you
saw
think
and
more
some
shadow
evil
fortune
that
has
been
will
Unless
indeed
some
lying
trick
the
Enemy
have
seen
the
faces
fair
warriors
old
laid
sleep
beneath
the
pools
the
Dead
Marshes
seeming
his
foul
arts
Nay
was
not
said
Faramir
For
his
works
fill
the
heart
with
loathing
but
heart
was
filled
with
grief
and
pity
Yet
how
could
such
thing
have
happened
truth
asked
Frodo
For
boat
could
have
been
carried
over
the
stony
hills
from
Tol
Brandir
and
Boromir
purposed
home
across
the
Entwash
and
the
fields
Rohan
And
yet
how
could
any
vessel
ride
the
foam
the
great
falls
and
not
founder
the
boiling
pools
though
laden
with
water
know
not
said
Faramir
But
whence
came
the
boat
From
Lorien
said
Frodo
three
such
boats
rowed
down
Anduin
the
Falls
They
also
were
elven
work
You
passed
through
the
Hidden
Land
said
Faramir
but
seems
that
you
little
understood
its
power
Men
have
dealings
with
the
Mistress
Magic
who
dwells
the
Golden
Wood
then
they
may
look
for
strange
things
follow
For
perilous
for
mortal
man
walk
out
the
world
this
Sun
and
few
old
came
thence
unchanged
tis
said
Boromir
Boromir
cried
What
did
she
say
you
the
Lady
that
dies
not
What
did
she
see
What
woke
your
heart
then
Why
went
you
ever
Laurelindorenan
and
came
not
your
own
road
upon
the
horses
Rohan
riding
home
the
morning
Then
turning
again
Frodo
spoke
quiet
voice
once
more
those
questions
guess
that
you
could
make
some
answer
Frodo
son
Drogo
But
not
here
now
maybe
But
lest
you
still
should
think
tale
vision
will
tell
you
this
The
horn
Boromir
least
returned
truth
and
not
seeming
The
horn
came
but
was
cloven
two
were
axe
sword
The
shards
came
severally
shore
one
was
found
among
the
reeds
where
watchers
Gondor
lay
northwards
below
the
infalls
the
Entwash
the
other
was
found
spinning
the
flood
one
who
had
errand
the
water
Strange
chances
but
murder
will
out
tis
said
668
THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
And
now
the
horn
the
elder
son
lies
two
pieces
upon
the
lap
Denethor
sitting
his
high
chair
waiting
for
news
And
you
can
tell
nothing
the
cleaving
the
horn
did
not
know
said
Frodo
But
the
day
when
you
heard
blowing
your
reckoning
true
was
the
day
when
parted
when
and
servant
left
the
Company
And
now
your
tale
fills
with
dread
For
Boromir
was
then
peril
and
was
slain
must
fear
that
all
companions
perished
too
And
they
were
kindred
and
friends
Will
you
not
put
aside
your
doubt
and
let
weary
and
full
grief
and
afraid
But
have
deed
attempt
before
too
slain
And
the
more
need
haste
two
halflings
are
all
that
remain
our
fellowship
back
Faramir
valiant
Captain
Gondor
and
defend
your
city
while
you
may
and
let
where
doom
takes
For
there
comfort
our
speech
together
said
Faramir
but
you
surely
draw
from
more
dread
than
need
Unless
the
people
Lorien
themselves
came
him
who
arrayed
Boromir
for
funeral
Not
Orcs
servants
the
Nameless
Some
your
Company
guess
live
still
But
whatever
befell
the
North
March
you
Frodo
doubt
longer
hard
days
have
made
any
judge
Men
words
and
faces
then
may
make
guess
Halflings
Though
and
now
smiled
there
something
strange
about
you
Frodo
Elvish
air
maybe
But
more
lies
upon
our
words
together
than
thought
first
should
now
take
you
back
Minas
Tirith
answer
there
Denethor
and
life
will
justly
forfeit
now
choose
course
that
proves
ill
for
city
will
not
decide
haste
what
done
Yet
must
move
hence
without
more
delay
sprang
his
feet
and
issued
some
orders
once
the
men
who
were
gathered
round
him
broke
into
small
groups
and
went
off
this
way
and
that
vanishing
quickly
into
the
shadows
the
rocks
and
trees
Soon
only
Mablung
and
Damrod
remained
Now
you
Frodo
and
Samwise
will
come
with
and
guards
said
Faramir
You
cannot
along
the
road
southwards
that
was
your
purpose
will
unsafe
for
some
days
and
always
more
closely
watched
after
this
affray
than
has
been
yet
And
you
cannot
think
far
today
any
case
for
you
are
weary
And
are
are
going
now
secret
place
have
somewhat
less
than
ten
miles
from
here
The
Orcs
and
spies
the
Enemy
have
not
found
yet
and
they
did
could
hold
long
even
against
many
There
may
lie
and
rest
for
while
and
you
with
the
morning
will
decide
what
best
for
and
for
you
THE
WINDOW
THE
WEST
669
There
was
nothing
for
Frodo
but
fall
with
this
request
order
seemed
any
case
wise
course
for
the
moment
since
this
foray
the
men
Gondor
had
made
journey
Ithilien
more
dangerous
than
ever
They
set
out
once
Mablung
and
Damrod
little
ahead
and
Faramir
with
Frodo
and
Sam
behind
Skirting
the
hither
side
the
pool
where
the
hobbits
had
bathed
they
crossed
the
stream
climbed
long
bank
and
passed
into
green
shadowed
woodlands
that
marched
ever
downwards
and
westwards
While
they
walked
swiftly
the
hobbits
could
they
talked
hushed
voices
broke
off
our
speech
together
said
Faramir
not
only
because
time
pressed
Master
Samwise
had
reminded
but
also
because
were
drawing
near
matters
that
were
better
not
debated
openly
before
many
men
was
for
that
reason
that
turned
rather
the
matter
brother
and
let
Jsz
dur
Bane
You
were
not
wholly
frank
with
Frodo
told
lies
and
the
truth
all
could
said
Frodo
not
blame
you
said
Faramir
You
spoke
with
skill
hard
place
and
wisely
seemed
But
learned
guessed
more
from
you
than
your
words
said
You
were
not
friendly
with
Boromir
you
did
not
part
friendship
You
and
Master
Samwise
too
guess
have
some
grievance
Now
loved
him
dearly
and
would
gladly
avenge
his
death
yet
knew
him
well
Isi
dur
Bane
would
hazard
that
Isildur
Bane
lay
between
you
and
was
cause
contention
your
Company
Clearly
mighty
heirloom
some
sort
and
such
things
not
breed
peace
among
confederates
not
aught
may
learned
from
ancient
tales
not
hit
near
the
mark
Near
said
Frodo
but
not
the
gold
There
was
contention
our
Company
though
there
was
doubt
doubt
which
way
should
take
from
the
Emyn
Muil
But
that
may
ancient
tales
teach
also
the
peril
rash
words
concerning
such
things
heirlooms
then
thought
your
trouble
was
with
Boromir
alone
wished
this
thing
brought
Minas
Tirith
Alas
crooked
fate
that
seals
your
lips
who
saw
him
last
and
holds
from
that
which
long
know
what
was
his
heart
and
thought
his
latest
hours
Whether
erred
this
sure
died
well
achieving
some
good
thing
His
face
was
more
beautiful
even
than
life
But
Frodo
pressed
you
hard
first
about
Isi
dur
Bane
Forgive
was
unwise
such
hour
and
place
had
not
had
time
for
thought
had
had
hard
fight
and
there
was
more
than
enough
fill
mind
But
even
spoke
with
you
drew
nearer
the
mark
and
deliberately
shot
wider
For
you
must
know
that
much

THE

Alas

Does

said
Frodo
Yet

But

They

But
stray
the

evil

hard
indeed
believe
that
one
great

for

wonderful

could
perish
and
much

taken
from

Are
you

this

THE
WINDOW
THE
WEST
671
see
that
there
some
great
tale
dread
this
said
Faramir
which
perhaps
you
may
tell
the
evening
time
This
Mithrandir
was
now
guess
more
than
lore
master
great
mover
the
deeds
that
are
done
our
time
Had
been
among
consult
concerning
the
hard
words
our
dream
could
have
made
them
clear
without
need
messenger
Yet
maybe
would
not
have
done
and
the
journey
Boromir
was
doomed
Mithrandir
never
spoke
what
was
nor
did
reveal
his
purposes
got
leave
Denethor
how
not
know
look
the
secrets
our
treasury
and
learned
little
him
when
would
teach
and
that
was
seldom
Ever
would
search
and
would
question
above
all
else
concerning
the
Great
Battle
that
was
fought
upon
Dagorlad
the
beginning
Gondor
when
whom
not
name
was
overthrown
And
was
eager
for
stories
Isildur
though
him
had
less
tell
for
nothing
certain
was
ever
known
among
his
end
Now
Faramir
voice
sank
whisper
But
this
much
learned
guessed
and
have
kept
ever
secret
heart
since
that
Isildur
took
somewhat
from
the
hand
the
Unnamed
ere
went
away
from
Gondor
never
seen
among
mortal
men
again
Here
thought
was
the
answer
Mithrandir
questioning
But
seemed
then
matter
that
concerned
only
the
seekers
after
ancient
learning
Nor
when
the
riddling
words
our
dream
were
debated
among
did
think
Isi
dur
Bane
being
this
same
thing
For
Isildur
was
ambushed
and
slain
orc
arrows
according
the
only
legend
that
knew
and
Mithrandir
had
never
told
more
What
truth
this
Thing
cannot
yet
guess
but
some
heirloom
power
and
peril
must
fell
weapon
perchance
devised
the
Dark
Lord
were
thing
that
gave
advantage
battle
can
well
believe
that
Boromir
the
proud
and
fearless
often
rash
ever
anxious
for
the
victory
Minas
Tirith
and
his
own
glory
therein
might
desire
such
thing
and
allured
Alas
that
ever
went
that
errand
should
have
been
chosen
father
and
the
elders
but
put
himself
forward
being
the
older
and
the
hardier
both
true
and
would
not
stayed
But
fear
more
would
not
take
this
thing
lay
the
highway
Not
were
Minas

falling
ruin
and
alone
could
save
her
using
the
weapon
the
Dark

for

Frodo

Drogo
Neither

Frodo
Nor

For

Frodo
made
answer
Almost
yielded
the
desire
for
help
and
counsel
tell
this
grave
young
man
whose
words
seemed
wise
and
fair
all
that
was
his
mind
But
something
held
him
back
His
heart
was
heavy
with
fear
and
sorrow
and
Sam
were
indeed
seemed
likely
all
that
was
now
left
the
Nine
Walkers
then
was
sole
command
the
secret
their
errand
Better
mistrust
undeserved
than
rash
words
And
the
memory
Boromir
the
dreadful
change
that
the
lure
the
Ring
had
worked
him
was
very
present
his
mind
when
looked
Faramir
and
listened
his
voice
unlike
they
were
and
yet
also
much
akin
They
walked
silence
for
while
passing
like
grey
and
green
shadows
under
the
old
trees
their
feet
making
sound
above
them
many
birds
sang
and
the
sun
glistened
the
polished
roof
dark
leaves
the
evergreen
woods
Ithilien
Sam
had
taken
part
the
conversation
though
had
listened
and
the
same
time
had
attended
with
his
keen
hobbit
ears
all
the
soft
woodland
noises
about
them
One
thing
had
noted
that
all
the
talk
the
name
Gollum
had
not
once
come
was
glad
though
felt
that
was
too
much
hope
that
would
never
hear
again
soon
became
aware
also
that
though
they
walked
alone
there
were
many
men
close
hand
not
only
Damrod
and
Mablung
flitting
and
out
the
shadows
ahead
but
others
either
side
all
making
their
swift
secret
way
some
appointed
place
Once
looking
suddenly
back
some
prickle
the
skin
told
him
that
was
watched
from
behind
thought
caught
brief
glimpse
small
dark
shape
slipping
behind
tree
trunk
opened
his
mouth
speak
and
shut
again
not
sure
said
himself
and
why
should
remind
them
the
old
villain
they
choose
forget
him
wish
could
THE

THE
WEST
673
they
passed
until
the
woodlands
grew
thinner
and
the
land
began
fall
more
steeply
Then
they
turned
aside
again
the
right
and
came
quickly
small
river
narrow
gorge
was
the
same
stream
that
trickled
far
above
out
the
round
pool
now
grown
swift
torrent
leaping
down
over
many
stones
deep
cloven
bed
overhung
with
ilex
and
dark
box
woods
Looking
west
they
could
see
below
them
haze
light
lowlands
and
broad
meads
and
glinting
far
off
the
westering
sun
the
wide
waters
the
Anduin
Here
alas
must
you
discourtesy
said
Faramir
hope
you
will
pardon
one
who
has
far
made
his
orders
give
way
courtesy
not
slay
you
bind
you
But
command
that
stranger
not
even
one
Rohan
that
fights
with
shall
see
the
path
now
with
open
eyes
must
blindfold
you
you
will
said
Frodo
Even
the
Elves
likewise
need
and
blindfolded
crossed
the
borders
fair
Lothlorien
Gimli
the
dwarf
took
ill
but
the
hobbits
endured
place
fair
that
shall
lead
you
said
Faramir
But
glad
that
you
will
take
this
willingly
and
not
force
called
softly
and
immediately
Mablung
and
Damrod
stepped
out
the
trees
and
came
back
him
Blindfold
these
guests
said
Faramir
Securely
but
not
discomfort
them
not
tie
their
hands
They
will
give
their
word
not
try
and
see
could
trust
them
shut
their
eyes
their
own
accord
but
eyes
will
blink
the
feet
stumble
Lead
them
that
they
not
falter
With
green
scarves
the
two
guards
now
bound
the
hobbits
eyes
and
drew
their
hoods
down
almost
their
mouths
then
quickly
they
took
each
one
the
hand
and
went
their
way
All
that
Frodo
and
Sam
knew
this
last
mile
the
road
they
learned
from
guess
ing
the
dark
After
little
they
found
that
they
were
path
descending
steeply
soon
grew
narrow
that
they
went
single
file
brushing
stony
wall
either
side
their
guards
steered
them
from
behind
with
hands
laid
firmly
their
shoulders
Now
and
again
they
came
rough
places
and
were
lifted
from
their
feet
for
while
and
then
set
down
again
Always
the
noise
the
running
water
was
their
right
hand
and
grew
nearer
and
louder
length
they
were
halted
Quickly
Mablung
and
Damrod
turned
them
about
several
times
and
they
lost
all
sense
direction
They
climbed
upwards
little
seemed
cold
and
the
noise
the
stream
had
become
faint
Then
they
were
picked
and
carried
down
down
many
steps
and
round
corner
Suddenly
they
heard
the
water
again
loud
now
rushing
and
splashing
All
round
them
seemed
and
they
felt
fine
rain
their
hands
and
cheeks
last
they
were
set
their
feet
once
more
For
moment
they
stood
half
fearful
blind
fold
not
knowing
where
they
were
and
one
spoke

THE
LORD
THE
RINGS
Then
came
the
voice
Faramir
close
behind
Let
them
see
said
The
scarves
were
removed
and
their
hoods
drawn
back
and
they
blinked
and
gasped
They
stood
wet
floor
polished
stone
the
doorstep
were
rough
hewn
gate
rock
opening
dark
behind
them
But
front
thin
veil
water
was
hung
near
that
Frodo
could
have
put
outstretched
arm
into
faced
westward
The
level
shafts
the
setting
sun
behind
beat
upon
and
the
red
light
was
broken
into
many
flickering
beams
ever
changing
colour
was
they
stood
the

some
elven
tower
curtained
with
threaded
jewels
silver
and
gold
and
ruby
sapphire
and
amethyst
all
kindled
with
unconsuming
fire
least

came
the

Even
spoke
the

sank
and
the

faded

They
turned
and
passed
under

they
found
themselves

there
Others
were

coming

through

narrow
door
one
side
their
eyes
grew
accustomed
the
gloom
the
hobbits
saw
that
the
cave
was
larger
than
they
had
guessed
and
was
filled
with
great
store
arms
and
victuals
Well
here
our
refuge
said
Faramir
Not

here

one

the
water
flowed
down
through
this
cave
and
out
the
arch
but
its
course
was
changed
further
the

workmen

and
the
stream
sent
down
fall
doubled
height
over
the

All
the

into

were
then
sealed
against

one
There
are
now
but
two

out
that
passage
yonder
which
you
entered
blindfold
and
through

into

Now
rest

until
the
evening
meal
set
The
hobbits
were
taken

and
given

they
wished
Meanwhile
men
busied
themselves
about
the
cave
quietly
and
orderly
quickness
Light
tables
were
taken
from
the
walls
and
set
trestles
and
laden
with
gear
This
was
plain
and
unadorned
for
the

For

Frodo
lay
back
and
watched
the

and
the

moving
and
fro

voices
Then
suddenly
Frodo
fell

Sam
struggled

The

Now
more

Storage

Men
were
fetching

from
the

Some
were
laving
their

wide
copper
bowl
and
white
cloth
were
brought
Faramir
and

Wake

Frodo
sat
and
yawned
and

Sam

with

the

who
bowed
holding

before
him
Put

said
Easier

Then
the
astonishment
and
amusement
the
Men
plunged
his
head
into
the
cold
water
and
splashed
his
neck
and
ears
the

the

They

beside

with

and
high
enough
above

the
Men
for

Before

Faramir
signed
Frodo

that

Frodo

strangely
rustic
and
untutored
But

our

and
after

That
also
said
Faramir
After

the

the

the

pale

eat
bread
and

and
salted
meats
and
dried

and
good
red
cheese
with
clean
hands
and
clean
knives
and
plates
Neither
Frodo
nor
Sam
refused
anything
that
was
offered
nor
second
nor
indeed
third
helping
The
wine
coursed
their
veins
and
tired
limbs
and
they
felt
glad
and
easy
heart
they
had
not
done
since
they
left

When

was

Faramir

Let

there

Frodo

But
though

his

had
not

Sam
was
beaming
and
humming
himself
but
when
Frodo
spoke
was

content
listen
only
occasionally
venturing

Frodo
told
many
tales
yet
always
steered
the

away
from
the

from

rather
the

Boromir

Maybe
would

Faramir
and
not
gone
the
fate
that
waited
above
the

Rauros
Maybe
But

for

they
fell
into
