CHAPTER
ONE
THE
RIDDLE
HOUSE
The
villagers
Little
Hangleron
still
called
the
Riddle
House
even
though
had
been
many
years
since
the
Riddle
family
had
lived
there
stood
hill
overlooking
the
village
some
its
windows
boarded
tiles
missing
from
its
roof
and
ivy
spreading
unchecked
over
its
face
Once
fine
looking
manor
and
easily
the
largest
and
grandest
building
for
miles
around
the
Riddle
House
was
now
damp
derelict
and
unoccupied
The
Little
Hagletons
all
agreed
that
the
old
house
was
creepy
Half
century
ago
something
strange
and
horrible
had
happened
there
something
that
the
older
inhabitants
the
village
still
liked
discuss
when
topics
for
gossip
were
scarce
The
story
had
been
picked
over
many
times
and
had
been
embroidered
many
places
that
nobody
was
quite
sure
what
the
truth
was
anymore
Every
version
the
tale
however
started
the
same
place
Fifty
years
before
daybreak
fine
summer
morning
when
the
Riddle
House
had
still
been
well
kept
and
impressive
maid
had
entered
the
drawing
room
find
all
three
Riddles
dead
The
maid
had
run
screaming
down
the
hill
into
the
village
and
roused
many
people
she
could
Lying
there
with
their
eyes
wide
open
Cold
ice
Still
their
dinner
things
The
police
were
summoned
and
the
whole
Little
Hangleton
had
seethed
with
shocked
curiosity
and
ill
disguised
excitement
Nobody
wasted
their
breath
pretending
feel
very
sad
about
the
Riddles
for
they
had
been
most
unpopular
Elderly
and
Mrs
Riddle
had
been
rich
snobbish
and
rude
and
their
grown
son
Tom
had
been
anything
worse
All
the
villagers
cared
about
was
the
identity
their
murderer
for
plainly
three
apparently
healthy
people
did
not
all
drop
dead
natural
causes
the
same
night
The
Hanged
Man
the
village
pub
did
roaring
trade
that
night
the
whole
village
seemed
have
turned
out
discuss
the
murders
They
were
rewarded
for
leaving
their
firesides
when
the
Riddles
cook
arrived
dramatically
their
midst
and
announced
the
suddenly
silent
pub
that
man
called
Frank
Bryce
had
just
been
arrested
Frank
cried
several
people
Never
Frank
Bryce
was
the
Riddles
gardener
lived
alone
run
down
cottage
the
grounds
the
Riddle
House
Frank
had
come
back
from
the
war
with
very
stiff
leg
and
great
dislike
crowds
and
loud
noises
and
had
been
working
for
the
Riddles
ever
since
There
was
rush
buy
the
cook
drinks
and
hear
more
details
Always
thought
was
odd
she
told
the
eagerly
listening
villagers
after
her
fourth
sherry
Unfriendly
like
sure
offered
him
cuppa
once
offered
hundred
times
Never
wanted
mix
didn
now
said
woman
the
bar
had
hard
war
Frank
likes
the
quiet
life
That
reason
Who
else
had
key
the
back
door
then
barked
the
cook
There
been
spare
key
hanging
the
gardener
cottage
far
back
can
remember
Nobody
forced
the
door
last
night
broken
windows
All
Frank
had
was
creep
the
big
house
while
was
all
sleeping
The
villagers
exchanged
dark
looks
always
thought
that
had
nasty
look
about
him
right
enough
grunted
man
the
bar
War
turned
him
funny
you
ask
said
the
landlord
Told
you
wouldn
like
get
the
wrong
side
Frank
didn
Dot
said
excited
woman
the
corner
Horrible
temper
said
Dot
nodding
fervently
remember
when
was
kid
the
following
morning
hardly
anyone
Little
Hangleton
doubted
that
Frank
Bryce
had
killed
the
Riddles
But
over
the
neighboring
town
Great
Hangleton
the
dark
and
dingy
police
station
Frank
was
stubbornly
repeating
again
and
again
that
was
innocent
and
that
the
only
person
had
seen
near
the
house
the
day
the
Riddles
deaths
had
been
teenage
boy
stranger
dark
haired
and
pale
Nobody
else
the
village
had
seen
any
such
boy
and
the
police
were
quite
sure
Frank
had
invented
him
Then
just
when
things
were
looking
very
serious
for
Frank
the
report
the
Riddles
bodies
came
back
and
changed
everything
The
police
had
never
read
odder
report
team
doctors
had
examined
the
bodies
and
had
concluded
that
none
the
Riddles
had
been
poisoned
stabbed
shot
strangles
suffocated
far
they
could
tell
harmed
all
fact
the
report
continued
tone
unmistakable
bewilderment
the
Riddles
all
appeared
perfet
health
apart
from
the
fact
that
they
were
all
dead
The
doctors
did
note
though
determined
find
something
wrong
with
the
bodies
that
each
the
Riddles
had
look
terror
upon
his
her
face
but
the
frustrated
police
said
whoever
heard
three
people
being
frightened
death
there
was
proof
that
the
Riddles
had
been
murdered
all
the
police
were
forced
let
Frank
The
Riddles
were
buried
the
Little
Hangleton
churchyard
and
their
graves
remained
objects
curiosity
for
while
everyone
surprise
and
amid
cloud
suspicion
Frank
Bryce
returned
his
cottage
the
grounds
the
Riddle
House
far
concerned
killed
them
and
don
care
what
the
police
say
said
Dot
the
Hanged
Man
And
had
any
decency
leave
here
knowing
how
knows
did
But
Frank
did
not
leave
stayed
tend
the
garden
for
the
next
family
who
lived
the
Riddle
House
and
then
the
next
for
neither
family
stayed
long
Perhaps
was
partly
because
Frank
that
the
new
owners
said
there
was
nasty
feeling
about
the
place
which
the
absence
inhabitants
started
fall
into
disrepair
The
wealthy
man
who
owned
the
Riddle
House
these
days
neither
lived
there
nor
put
any
use
they
said
the
village
that
kept
for
tax
reasons
though
nobody
was
very
clear
what
these
might
The
wealthy
owner
continued
pay
Frank
the
gardening
however
Frank
was
nearing
his
seventy
seventh
birthday
now
very
deaf
his
bad
leg
stiffer
than
ever
but
could
seen
pottering
around
the
flower
beds
fine
weather
even
though
the
weeds
were
starting
creep
him
try
might
suppress
them
Weeds
were
not
the
only
things
Frank
had
contend
with
either
Boys
from
the
village
made
habit
throwing
stones
through
the
windows
the
Riddle
House
They
rode
their
bicycles
over
the
lawns
Frank
worked
hard
keep
smooth
Once
twice
they
broke
into
the
old
house
for
dare
They
knew
that
old
Frank
devotion
the
house
and
the
grounds
amounted
almost
obsession
and
amused
them
see
him
limping
across
the
garden
brandishing
his
stick
and
yelling
croakily
them
Frank
for
his
part
believed
the
boys
tormented
him
because
they
like
their
parents
and
grandparents
though
him
murderer
when
Frank
awoke
one
night
August
and
saw
something
very
odd
the
old
house
merely
assumed
that
the
boys
had
gone
one
step
further
their
attempts
punish
him
was
Frank
bad
leg
that
woke
him
was
paining
him
worse
than
ever
his
old
age
got
and
limped
downstairs
into
the
kitchen
with
the
idea
refilling
his
hot
water
bottle
ease
the
stiffness
his
knee
Standing
the
sink
filling
the
kettle
looked
the
Riddle
House
and
saw
lights
glimmering
its
upper
windows
Frank
knew
once
what
was
going
The
boys
had
broken
into
the
house
again
and
judging
the
flickering
quality
the
light
they
had
started
fire
Frank
had
telephone
any
case
had
deeply
mistrusted
the
police
ever
since
they
had
taken
him
for
questioning
about
the
Riddles
deaths
put
down
the
kettle
once
hurried
back
upstairs
fast
his
bad
leg
would
allow
and
was
soon
back
his
kitchen
fully
dressed
and
removing
rusty
old
key
from
its
hook
the
door
picked
his
walking
stick
which
was
propped
against
the
wall
and
set
off
into
the
night
The
front
door
the
Riddle
House
bore
sign
being
forced
nor
did
any
the
windows
Frank
limped
around
the
back
the
house
until
reached
door
almost
completely
hidden
ivy
took
out
the
old
key
put
into
the
lock
and
opened
the
door
noiselessly
let
himself
into
the
cavernous
kitchen
Frank
had
not
entered
for
many
years
nevertheless
although
was
very
dark
remembered
where
the
door
into
the
hall
was
and
groped
his
way
towards
his
nostrils
full
the
smell
decay
ears
pricked
for
any
sound
footsteps
voices
from
overhead
reached
the
hall
which
was
little
lighter
owing
the
large
mullioned
windows
either
side
the
front
door
and
started
climb
the
stairs
blessing
the
dust
that
lay
thick
upon
the
stone
because
muffled
the
sound
his
feet
and
stick
the
landing
Frank
turned
right
and
saw
once
where
the
intruders
were
the
every
end
the
passage
door
stood
ajar
and
flickering
light
shone
through
the
gap
casting
long
sliver
gold
across
the
black
floor
Frank
edged
closer
and
closer
was
able
see
narrow
slice
the
room
beyond
The
fire
now
saw
had
been
lit
the
grate
This
surprised
him
Then
stopped
moving
and
listened
intently
for
man
voice
spoke
within
the
room
sounded
timid
and
fearful
There
little
more
the
bottle
Lord
you
are
still
hungry
Later
said
second
voice
This
too
belonged
man
but
was
strangely
high
pitched
and
cold
sudden
blast
icy
wind
Something
about
that
voice
made
the
sparse
hairs
the
back
Frank
neck
stand
Move
closer
the
fire
Wormtail
Frank
turned
his
right
ear
toward
the
door
the
better
hear
There
came
the
clink
bottle
being
put
down
upon
some
hard
surface
and
then
the
dull
scraping
noise
heavy
chair
being
dragged
across
the
floor
Frank
caught
glimpse
small
man
his
back
the
door
pushing
the
chair
into
place
was
wearing
long
black
cloak
and
there
was
bald
patch
the
back
his
head
Then
went
out
sight
again
Where
Nagini
said
the
cold
voice
don
know
Lord
said
the
first
voice
nervously
She
set
out
explore
the
house
think
You
will
milk
her
before
retire
Wormtail
said
the
second
voice
will
need
feeding
the
night
The
journey
has
tired
greatly
Brow
furrowed
Frank
inclined
his
good
ear
still
closer
the
door
listening
very
hard
There
was
pause
and
then
the
man
called
Wormtail
spoke
again
Lord
may
ask
how
long
are
going
stay
here
week
said
the
cold
voice
Perhapse
longer
The
place
moderately
comfortable
and
the
plan
cannot
proceed
yet
would
foolish
act
before
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
over
Frank
inserted
gnarled
finger
into
his
ear
and
rotated
Owing
doubt
buildup
earwax
had
heard
the
word
Quidditch
which
was
not
word
all
The
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
Lord
said
Wormtail
Frank
dug
his
finger
still
more
vigorously
into
his
ear
Forgive
but
not
understand
why
should
wait
until
the
World
Cup
over
Because
fool
this
very
moment
wizards
are
pouring
into
the
country
from
all
over
the
world
and
every
meddler
from
the
Ministry
Magic
will
duty
the
watch
for
signs
ususual
activity
checking
and
double
checking
identities
They
will
obsessed
with
security
lest
the
Muggles
notice
anything
wait
Frank
stopped
trying
clear
out
his
ear
had
distinctly
heard
the
words
Ministry
Magic
wizards
and
Muggles
Plainly
each
these
expressions
meant
something
secret
and
Frank
could
think
only
two
sorts
people
who
would
speak
code
spies
and
criminals
Frank
tightened
his
hold
his
walking
stick
once
more
and
listened
more
closely
still
Your
Lordship
still
determined
then
Wormtail
said
quietly
Certainly
determined
Wormtail
There
was
note
menace
the
cold
voice
now
slight
pause
followed
and
the
Wormtail
spoke
the
words
tumbling
from
him
rush
though
was
forcing
himself
say
this
before
lost
his
nerve
could
done
without
Harry
Potter
Lord
Another
pause
more
protracted
and
then
Without
Harry
Potter
breathed
the
second
voice
softly
see
Lord
not
say
this
out
concern
for
the
boy
said
Wormtail
his
voice
rising
squeakily
The
boy
nothing
nothing
all
merely
that
were
use
another
witch
wizard
any
wizard
the
thing
could
done
much
more
quickly
you
allowed
leave
you
for
short
while
you
know
that
can
disguise
myself
most
effectively
could
back
here
little
two
days
with
suitable
person
could
use
another
wizard
said
the
cold
voice
softly
that
true
Lord
makes
sense
said
Wormtail
sounding
thoroughly
relieved
now
Laying
hands
Harry
Potter
would
difficult
well
protected
And
you
volunteer
and
fetch
substitute
wonder
perhaps
the
task
nursing
has
become
wearisome
for
you
Wormtail
Could
this
suggestion
abandoning
the
plan
nothing
more
than
attempt
desert
Lord
have
wish
leave
you
none
all
not
lie
hissed
the
second
voice
can
always
tell
Wormtail
You
are
regretting
that
you
ever
returned
revolt
you
see
you
flinch
when
you
look
feel
you
shudder
when
you
touch
devotion
Your
Lordship
Your
devotion
nothing
more
than
cowardice
You
would
not
here
you
had
anywhere
else
How
survive
without
you
when
need
feeding
every
few
hours
Who
milk
Nagini
But
you
seem
much
stronger
Lord
Liar
breathed
the
second
voice
stronger
and
few
days
alone
would
enough
rob
the
little
health
have
regained
under
your
clumsy
care
Silence
Wormtail
who
had
been
sputtering
incoherently
fell
silent
once
For
few
seconds
Frank
could
hear
nothing
but
the
fire
crackling
The
the
second
man
spoke
once
more
whisper
that
was
almost
hiss
have
reasons
for
using
the
boy
have
already
explained
you
and
will
use
other
have
waited
thirteen
years
few
more
months
will
make
difference
for
the
protection
surrounding
the
boy
believe
plan
will
effective
All
that
needed
little
courage
from
you
Wormtail
courage
you
will
find
unless
you
wish
feel
the
full
extent
Lord
Voldermort
wrath
Lord
must
speak
said
Wormtail
panic
his
voice
now
All
through
our
journey
have
gone
over
the
plan
head
Lord
Bertha
Jorkin
disappearance
will
not
unnoticed
for
long
and
proceed
murder
whispered
the
second
voice
you
follow
the
plan
Wormtail
the
Ministry
need
never
know
that
anyone
else
has
died
You
will
quietly
and
without
fuss
only
wish
that
could
myself
but
present
condition
Come
Wormtail
one
more
death
and
our
path
Harry
Potter
clear
not
asking
you
alone
that
time
faithful
serant
will
have
rejoined
faithful
servant
said
Wormtail
the
merest
trace
sullenness
his
voice
Wormtail
need
somebody
with
brains
somebody
whose
loyalty
has
never
wavered
and
you
unfortunately
fulfill
neither
requirement
found
you
said
Wormtail
and
there
was
definitely
sulky
edge
his
voice
now
was
the
one
who
found
you
brought
you
Bertha
Jorkins
That
true
said
the
second
man
sounding
amused
stroke
brilliance
would
not
have
thought
possible
from
you
Wormtail
though
truth
told
you
were
not
aware
how
useful
she
would
when
you
caught
her
were
you
thought
she
might
useful
Lord
Liar
said
the
second
voice
again
the
cruel
amusement
more
pronounced
than
ever
However
not
deny
that
her
information
was
invaluable
Without
could
never
have
formed
our
plan
and
for
that
you
will
have
your
reward
Wormtail
will
allow
you
perform
essential
task
for
one
that
many
followers
would
give
their
right
hands
perform
really
Lord
What
Wormtail
sounded
terrified
again
Wormtail
you
don
want
spoil
the
surprise
Your
part
will
come
the
very
end

Bertha

You
you
Wormtail
voice
suddenly
sounded
hoarse
though
his
mouth
had
gone
very
dry
You
are
going
kill
too
Wormtail
Wormtail
said
the
cold
voice
silkily
why
would
kill
you
killed
Bertha
because
had
She
was
fit
for
nothing
after
questioning
quite
useless
any
case
awkward
questions
would
have
been
asked
she
had
gone
back
the
Ministry
with
the
news
that
she
had
met
you
her
holidays
Wizards

dead

well

Magic

Wormtail
muttered
something
quietly
that
Frank
could
not
hear
but
made
the
second
man
laugh
entirely
mirthless
laugh
cold
his
speech
could
have
modified
her
memory
But
Memory
Charms
can
broken

wizard
proved
when
questioned
her
would
insult
her
memory
not
use
the
information
extracted
from
her
Wormtail
Out
the
corridor
Frank
suddenly
became
aware
that
the
hand
gripping
his
walking
stick
was
slippery
with
sweat
The
man
with
the
cold
voice
had
killed
woman
was
talking
about
without
any
kind
remorse
with
amusement
was
dangerous
madman
And
was
planning
more
murders
this
boy
Harry
Potter
whoever
was
was
danger
Frank
knew
what
must
Now
ever
was
the
time
the
police
would
creep
out
the
house
and
head
straight
for
the
telephone
box
the
village
but
the
cold
voice
was
speaking
again
and
Frank
remained
where
was
frozen
the
spot
listening
with
all
his
might
One
more
murder
faithful
servant
Hogwarts
Harry
Potter
good
mine
Wormtail
decided
There
will
more
argument
But
quiet
think
hear
Nagini
And
the
second
man
voice
changed
started
making
noises
such
Frank
had
never
heard
before
was
hissing
and
spitting
without
drawing
breath
Frank
thought
must
having
some
sort
fit
seizure
And
then
Frank
heard
movement
behind
him
the
dark
passageway
turned
look
and
found
himself
paralyzed
with
fright
Something
was
slithering
toward
him
along
the
dark
corridor
floor
and
drew
nearer
the
sliver
firelight
realized
with
thrill
terror
that
was
gigantic
snake
least
twelve
feet
long
Horrified
transfixed
Frank
stared
its
undulating
body
cut
wide
curving
track
through
the
thick
dust
the
floor
coming
closer
and
closer
What
was
The
only
means
escape
was
into
the
room
where
the
two
men
sat
plotting
murder
yet
stayed
where
was
the
snake
would
surely
kill
him
But
before
had
made
his
decision
the
snake
was
level
with
him
and
then
incredibly
miraculously
was
passing
was
following
the
spitting
hissing
noises
made
the
cold
voice
beyond
the
door
and
seconds
the
tip
its
diamond
patterned
tail
had
vanished
through
the
gap
There
was
sweat
Frank
forehead
now
and
the
hand
the
walking
stick
was
trembling
Inside
the
room
the
cold
voice
was
continuing
hiss
and
Frank
was
visited
strange
idea
impossible
idea
This
man
could
talk
snakes
Frank
didn
understand
what
was
going
wanted
more
than
anything
back
his
bed
with
his
hot
water
bottle
The
problem
was
that
his
legs
didn
seem
want
move
stood
there
shaking
and
trying
master
himself
the
cold
voice
switched
abruptly
English
again
Nagini
has
interesting
news
Wormtail
said
indeed
Lord
said
Wormtail
Indeed
yes
said
the
voice
According
Nagini
there
old
Muggle
standing
right
outside
this
room
listening
every
word
say
Frank
didn
have
chance
hide
himself
There
were
footsteps
and
then
the
door
the
room
was
flung
wide
open
short
balding
man
with
graying
hair
pointed
nose
and
small
watery
eyes
stood
before
Frank
mixture
fear
and
alarm
his
face
Invite
him
inside
Wormtail
Where
are
your
manners
The
cold
voice
was
coming
from
the
ancient
armchair
before
the
fire
but
Frank
couldn
see
the
speaker
the
snake
the
other
hand
was
curled
the
rotting
hearth
rug
like
some
horrible
travesty
pet
dog
Wormtail
beckoned
Frank
into
the
room
Though
still
deeply
shaken
Frank
took
firmer
grip
his
walking
stick
and
limped
over
the
threshold
The
fire
was
the
only
source
light
the
room
cast
long
spidery
shadows
upon
the
walls
Frank
stared
the
back
the
armchair
the
man
inside
seemed
even
smaller
than
his
servant
for
Frank
couldn
even
see
the
back
his
head
You
heard
everything
Muggle
said
the
cold
voice
What
that
you
calling
said
Frank
defiantly
for
now
that
was
inside
the
room
now
that
the
time
had
come
for
some
sort
action
felt
braver
had
always
been
the
war
calling
you
Muggle
said
the
voice
coolly
means
that
you
are
not
wizard
don
know
what
you
mean
wizard
said
Frank
his
voice
growing
steadier
All
know
heard
enough
interest
the
police
tonight
have
You
done
murder
and
you
planning
more
And
tell
youthis
too
added
sudden
inspiration
wife
knows
here
and
don
come
back
You
have
wife
said
cold
voice
very
quietly
Nobody
knows
you
are
here
You
told
nobody
that
you
were
coming
not
lie
Lord
Voldemort
Muggle
for
knows
always
knows
that
right
said
Frank
roughly
Lord
Well
don
think
much
your
manners
Lord
Turn
round
and
face
like
man
why
don
you
But
not
man
Muggle
said
the
cold
voice
barely
audible
now
over
the
crackling
the
flames
much
much
more
than
man
However
why
not
will
face
you
Wormtail
come
turn
chair
around
The
servant
gave
whimper
You
heard
Wormtail
Slowly
with
his
face
screwed
though
would
rather
have
done
anything
than
approach
his
master
and
the
hearth
rug
where
the
snake
lay
the
small
man
walked
forward
and
began
turn
the
chair
The
snake
lifted
its
ugly
triangular
head
and
hissed
slightly
the
legs
the
chair
snagged
its
rug
And
then
the
chair
was
facing
Frank
and
saw
what
was
sitting
His
walking
stick
fell
the
floor
with
clatter
opened
his
mouth
and
let
out
scream
was
screaming
loudly
that
never
heard
the
words
the
thing
the
chair
spoke
raised
wand
There
was
flash
green
light
rushing
sound
and
Frank
Bryce
crumpled
was
dead
before
hit
the
floor
Two
hundred
miles
away
the
boy
called
Harry
Potter
woke
with
start
CHAPTER
TWO
THE
SCAR
Harry
lay
flat
his
back
breathing
hard
though
had
been
running
had
awoken
from
vivid
dream
with
his
hands
pressed
over
his
face
The
old
scar
his
forehead
which
was
shaped
like
bolt
lightning
was
burning
beneath
his
fingers
though
someone
had
just
pressed
white
hot
wire
his
skin
sat
one
hand
still
his
scar
the
other
hand
reaching
out
the
darkness
for
his
glasses
which
were
the
bedside
table
put
them
and
his
bedroom
came
into
clearer
focus
lit
faint
misty
orange
light
that
was
filtering
through
the
curtains
from
the
street
lamp
outside
the
window
Harry
ran
his
fingers
over
the
scar
again
was
still
painful
turned
the
lamp
beside
him
scrambled
out
bed
crossed
the
room
opened
his
wardrobe
and
peered
into
the
mirror
the
inside
the
door
skinny
boy
fourteen
looked
back
him
his
bright
green
eyes
puzzled
under
his
untidy
black
hair
examined
the
lightning
bolt
scar
his
reflection
more
closely
looked
normal
but
was
still
stinging
harry
tried
recall
what
had
been
dreaming
about
before
had
awoken
had
seemed
real
There
had
been
two
people
knew
and
one
didn
concentrated
hard
frowning
trying
remember
The
dim
picture
darkened
room
came
him
There
had
been
snake
hearth
rug
small
man
called
Peter
nicknamed
Wormtail
and
cold
high
voice
the
voice
Lord
Voldemort
Harry
felt
though
ice
cube
had
slipped
down
into
his
stomach
the
very
thought
closed
his
eyes
tightly
and
tried
remember
what
Voldemort
had
looked
like
but
was
impossible
All
Harry
knew
was
that
the
moment
when
Voldemort
chair
had
swung
around
and
Harry
had
seen
what
was
sitting
had
felt
spasm
horror
which
had
awoken
him
had
that
been
the
pain
his
scar
And
who
had
the
old
man
been
For
there
had
definitely
been
old
man
Harry
had
watched
him
fall
the
ground
was
all
becoming
confused
Harry
put
his
face
into
his
hands
blocking
out
his
bedroom
trying
hold
the
picture
that
dimly
lit
room
but
was
like
trying
keep
water
his
cupped
hands
the
details
were
now
trickling
away
fast
tried
hold
them
Voldemort
and
Wormtail
had
been
talking
about
someone
they
had
killed
though
Harry
could
not
remember
the
name
and
they
had
been
plotting
kill
someone
else
him
Harry
took
his
face
out
his
hands
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
around
his
bedroom
though
expecting
see
something
unusual
there
happened
there
was
extraordinary
number
unusual
things
this
room
large
wooden
trunk
stood
open
the
foot
his
bed
revealing
cauldron
broomstick
black
robes
and
assorted
spellbooks
Rolls
parchment
littered
that
part
his
desk
that
was
not
taken
the
large
empty
cage
which
his
snowy
owl
Hedwig
usually
perched
the
floor
beside
his
bed
book
lay
open
Harry
had
been
reading
before
fell
asleep
last
night
The
pictures
this
book
were
all
moving
Men
bright
orange
robes
were
zooming
and
out
sight
broomsticks
throwing
red
ball
one
another
Harry
walked
over
the
book
picked
and
watched
the
wizards
score
spectacular
goal
putting
the
ball
through
fifty
foot
high
hoop
Then
snapped
the
book
shut
Even
Quidditch
Harry
opinion
the
best
sport
the
world
couldn
distract
him
the
moment
placed
Flying
with
the
Cannons
his
bedside
table
crossed
the
window
and
drew
back
the
curtains
survey
the
street
below
Privet
Drive
looked
exactly
respectable
suburban
street
would
expected
look
inthe
early
hours
Saturday
morning
All
the
curtains
were
closed
far
Harry
could
see
through
the
darkness
there
wasn
living
creature
sight
not
even
cat
And
yet
and
yet
Harry
went
restlessly
back
the
bed
and
sat
down
running
finger
over
his
scar
again
wasn
the
pain
that
bothered
him
Harry
was
stranger
pain
and
injury
had
lost
all
the
bones
from
his
right
arm
once
and
had
them
painfully
regrown
night
The
same
arm
had
been
pierced
venemous
foot
long
fang
not
long
afterward
Only
last
year
Harry
had
fallen
fifty
feet
from
airborn
broomstick
was
used
bizarre
accidents
and
injuries
they
were
unavoidable
you
attended
Hogwarts
School
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
and
had
knack
for
attracting
lot
trouble
the
thing
that
was
bothering
Harry
was
the
last
time
his
scar
had
hurt
him
had
been
because
Voldemort
had
been
close
But
Voldemort
couldn
here
now
The
idea
Voldemort
lurking
Privet
Drive
was
absurd
impossible
Harry
listened
closely
the
silence
around
him
Was
half
expecting
hear
the
creak
stair
the
swish
cloak
And
then
jumped
slightly
heard
his
cousin
Dudley
give
tremendous
grunting
snore
from
the
next
room
Harry
shook
himself
mentally
was
being
stupid
There
was
one
the
house
with
him
except
Uncle
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
and
they
were
plainly
still
asleep
their
dreams
untroubled
and
painless
Asleep
was
the
way
Harry
liked
the
Dursleys
best
wasn
though
they
were
ever
any
help
him
awake
Uncle
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
were
Harry
only
living
relatives
They
were
Muggles
who
hated
and
despised
magic
any
form
which
meant
that
Harry
was
about
welcome
their
house
dry
rot
They
had
explained
away
Harry
long
absences
Hogwarts
over
the
last
three
years
telling
everyone
that
went
Brutus
Secure
Center
for
Incurably
Criminal
Boys
They
knew
perfectly
well
that
underage
wizard
Harry
wasn
allowed
use
magic
outside
Hogwarts
but
they
were
still
apt
blame
him
for
anything
that
went
wrong
about
the
house
Harry
had
never
been
able
confide
them
tell
them
anything
about
his
life
the
wizarding
world
The
very
idea
going
them
when
they
awoke
and
telling
them
about
his
scar
hurting
him
and
about
his
worries
about
Voldemort
was
laughable
And
yet
was
because
Voldemort
that
Harry
had
come
live
with
the
Dursleys
the
first
place
hadn
been
for
Voldemort
Harry
would
not
have
had
the
lightning
scar
his
forehead
hadn
been
for
Voldemort
Harry
would
still
have
had
parents
Harry
had
been
year
old
the
night
that
Voldemort
the
most
powerful
Dark
wizard
for
century
wizard
who
had
been
gaining
power
steadily
for
eleven
years
arrived
his
house
and
killed
his
father
and
mother
Voldemort
had
then
turned
his
wand
Harry
had
performed
the
curse
that
had
disposed
many
full
grown
witches
and
wizards
his
steady
rise
power
and
incredibly
had
not
worked
Instead
killing
the
small
boy
the
curse
had
rebounded
upon
Voldemort
Harry
had
survived
with
nothing
but
lightning
shaped
cut
his
forehead
and
Voldemort
had
been
reduced
something
barely
alive
His
powers
gone
his
life
almost
extinguished
Voldemort
had
fled
the
terror
which
the
secret
community
witches
and
wizards
had
lived
for
long
had
lifted
Voldemort
followers
had
disbanded
and
Harry
Potter
had
become
famous
had
been
enough
shock
for
Harry
discover
his
eleventh
birthday
that
was
wizard
had
been
even
more
disconcerting
find
out
that
everyone
the
hidden
wizarding
world
knew
his
name
Harry
had
arrived
Hogwarts
find
that
heads
turned
and
whispers
followed
him
wherever
went
But
was
used
now
the
end
this
summer
would
starting
his
fourth
year
Hogwarts
and
Harry
was
already
counting
the
days
until
would
back
the
castle
again
But
there
was
still
fortnight
before
went
back
school
looked
hopelessly
around
his
room
again
and
his
eye
paused
the
birthday
cards
his
two
best
friends
had
sent
him
the
end
July
What
would
they
say
Harry
wrote
them
and
told
them
about
his
scar
hurting
once
Hermione
Granger
voice
seemed
fill
his
head
shrill
and
panicky
Your
scar
hurt
Harry
that
really
serious
Write
Professor
Dumbledore
And
and
check
Common
Magical
Ailments
and
Afflictions
Maybe
there
something
there
about
curse
scars
Yes
that
would
Hermione
advice
straight
the
headmaster
Hogwarts
and
the
meantime
consult
book
Harry
stared
out
the
window
the
inky
blue
black
sky
doubted
very
much
whether
book
could
help
him
now
far
knew
was
the
only
living
person
have
survived
curse
like
Voldemort
was
highly
unlikely
therefore
that
would
find
his
symptoms
listed
Common
Magical
Ailments
and
Afflictions
for
informing
the
headmaster
Harry
had
idea
where
Dumbledore
went
during
the
summer
holidays
amused
himself
for
moment
picturing
Dumbledore
with
his
long
silver
beard
full
length
wizard
robes
and
pointed
hat
stretched
out
beach
somewhere
rubbing
suntan
lotion
onto
his
long
crooked
nose
Wherever
Dumbledore
was
though
Harry
was
sure
that
Hedwig
would
able
find
him
Harry
owl
had
never
yet
failed
deliver
letter
anyone
even
without
address
But
what
would
write
Dear
Professor
Dumbledore
Sorry
bother
you
but
scar
hurt
this
morning
Yours
sincerely
Harry
Potter
Even
inside
his
head
the
words
sounded
stupid
And
tried
imagine
his
other
best
friend
Ron
Weasley
reaction
and
moment
Ron
red
hair
and
long
nosed
freckled
face
seemed
swim
before
Harry
wearing
bemused
expression
Your
scar
hurt
But
but
You
Know
Who
can
near
you
now
can
mean
you
know
wouldn
you
trying
you
again
wouldn
dunno
Harry
maybe
curse
scars
always
twinge
bit
ask
Dad
Weasley
was
fully
qualified
wizard
who
worked
the
Misuse
Muggle
Artifacts
Office
the
Ministry
Magic
but
didn
have
any
particular
expertise
the
matter
curses
far
Harry
knew
any
case
Harry
didn
like
the
idea
the
whole
Weasley
family
knowing
that
Harry
was
getting
jumpy
about
few
moments
pain
Mrs
Weasley
would
fuss
worse
than
Hermione
and
Fred
and
George
Ron
sixteen
year
old
twin
brothers
might
think
Harry
was
losing
his
nerve
The
Weasleys
were
Harry
favorite
family
the
world
was
hoping
that
they
might
invite
him
stay
any
time
now
Ron
had
mentioned
something
about
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
and
somehow
didn
want
his
visit
punctuated
with
anxious
inquiries
about
his
scar
Harry
kneaded
his
forehead
with
his
knuckles
What
really
wanted
and
felt
almost
shameful
admit
himself
was
someone
like
someone
like
parent
adult
wizard
whose
advice
could
ask
without
feeling
stupid
someone
who
cared
about
him
who
had
had
experience
with
Dark
Magic
And
then
the
solution
came
him
was
simple
and
obvious
that
couldn
believe
had
taken
long
Sirius
Harry
leapt
from
the
bed
hurried
across
the
room
and
sat
down
his
desk
pulled
piece
parchment
toward
him
loaded
his
eagle
feather
quill
with
ink
wrote
Dear
Sirius
then
paused
wondering
how
best
phrase
his
problem
still
marveling
the
fact
that
hadn
thought
Sirius
straight
away
But
then
perhaps
wasn
surprising
after
all
had
only
found
out
that
Sirius
was
his
godfather
two
months
ago
There
was
simple
reason
for
Sirius
complete
absence
from
Harry
life
until
then
Sirius
had
been
Azkaban
the
terrifying
wizard
jail
guarded
creatures
called
dementors
sightless
soul
sucking
fiends
who
had
come
search
for
Sirius
Hogwarts
when
had
escaped
Yet
Sirius
had
been
innocent
the
murders
for
which
had
been
convicted
had
been
committed
Wormtail
Voldemort
supporter
whom
nearly
everybody
now
believed
dead
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
knew
otherwise
however
they
had
come
face
face
with
Wormtail
only
the
previous
year
though
only
Professor
Dumbledore
had
believed
their
story
For
one
glorious
hour
Harry
had
believed
that
was
leaving
the
Dursleys
last
because
Sirius
had
offered
him
home
once
his
name
had
been
cleared
But
the
chance
had
been
snatched
away
from
him
Wormtail
had
escaped
before
they
could
take
him
the
Ministry
Magic
and
Sirius
had
had
flee
for
his
life
Harry
had
helped
him
escape
the
back
hippogriff
called
Buckbeak
and
since
then
Sirius
had
been
the
run
The
home
Harry
might
have
had
Wormtail
had
not
escaped
had
been
haunting
him
all
summer
had
been
doubly
hard
return
the
Dursleys
knowing
that
had
nearly
escaped
them
forever
Nevertheless
Sirius
had
been
some
help
Harry
even
couldn
with
him
was
due
Sirius
that
Harry
now
had
all
his
school
things
his
bedroom
with
him
The
Dursleys
had
never
allowed
this
before
their
general
wish
keeping
Harry
miserable
possible
coupled
with
their
fear
his
powers
had
led
them
lock
his
school
trunk
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
every
summer
prior
this
But
their
attitude
had
changed
since
they
had
found
out
that
Harry
had
dangerous
murderer
for
godfather
for
Harry
had
conveniently
forgotten
tell
them
that
Sirius
was
innocent
Harry
had
received
two
letters
from
Sirius
since
had
been
back
Privet
Drive
Both
had
been
delivered
not
owls
was
usual
with
wizards
but
large
brightly
colored
tropical
birds
Hedwig
had
not
approved
these
flashy
intruders
she
had
been
most
reluctant
allow
them
drink
from
her
water
tray
before
flying
off
again
Harry
the
other
hand
had
liked
them
they
put
him
mind
palm
trees
and
white
sand
and
hoped
that
wherever
Sirius
was
Sirius
never
said
case
the
letters
were
intercepted
was
enjoying
himself
Somehow
Harry
found
hard
imaging
dementors
surviving
for
long
bright
sunlight
perhapse
that
was
why
Sirius
had
gone
South
Sirius
letters
which
were
now
hidden
beneath
the
highly
useful
loose
floorboards
under
Harry
bed
sounded
chearful
and
both
them
had
reminded
Harry
call
him
ever
Harry
needed
Well
needed
right
now
all
right
Harry
lamp
seemed
grow
dimmer
the
cold
gray
light
that
precedes
sunrise
slowly
crept
into
the
room
Finally
when
the
sun
had
risen
when
his
bedroom
walls
had
turned
gold
and
when
sounds
movement
could
heard
from
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
room
Harry
cleared
his
desk
crumpled
pieces
parchment
and
reread
his
finished
letter
Dear
Sirius
Thanks
for
your
last
letter
That
bird
was
enormous
could
hardly
get
through
window
Things
are
the
same
usual
here
Dudley
diet
isn
going
too
well
aunt
found
him
smuggling
doughnuts
into
his
room
yesterday
They
told
him
they
have
cut
his
pocket
money
keeps
doing
got
really
angry
and
chucked
his
PlayStation
out
the
window
That
sort
computer
thing
you
can
play
games
Bit
stupid
really
now
hasn
even
got
Mega
Mutilation
Part
Three
take
his
mind
off
things
okay
mainly
because
the
Dursleys
are
terrified
you
might
turn
and
turn
them
all
into
bats
ask
you
weird
thing
happened
this
morning
though
scar
hurt
again
Last
time
that
happened
was
because
Voldemort
was
Hogwarts
But
don
reckon
can
anywhere
near
now
can
you
know
curse
scars
sometimes
hurt
years
afterward
send
this
with
Hedwig
when
she
gets
back
she
off
hunting
the
moment
Say
hello
Buckbeak
for
Harry
Yes
thought
Harry
that
looked
all
right
There
was
point
putting
the
dream
didn
want
look
though
was
too
worried
folded
the
parchment
and
laid
aside
his
desk
ready
for
when
Hedwig
returned
Then
got
his
feet
stretched
and
opened
his
wardrobe
once
more
Without
glancing
his
reflection
started
get
dressed
before
going
down
breakfast
CHAPTER
THREE
THE
INVITATION
the
time
Harry
arrived
the
kitchen
the
three
Dursleys
were
already
seated
around
the
table
None
them
looked
entered
sat
down
Uncle
Vernon
large
red
face
was
hidden
behind
the
morning
Daily
Mail
and
Aunt
Petunia
was
cutting
grapefruit
into
quarters
her
lips
pursed
over
her
horselike
teeth
Dudley
looked
furious
and
sulky
and
somehow
seemed
taking
even
more
space
than
usual
This
was
saying
something
always
took
entire
side
the
square
table
himself
When
Aunt
Petunia
put
quarter
unsweetened
grapefruit
onto
Dudley
plate
with
tremulous
There
you
are
Diddy
darling
Dudley
glowered
her
His
life
had
taken
most
unpleasant
turn
since
had
come
home
for
the
summer
with
his
end
year
report
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
had
managed
find
excuses
for
his
bad
marks
usual
Aunt
Petunia
always
insisted
that
Dudley
was
very
gifted
boy
whose
teachers
didn
understand
him
while
Uncle
Vernon
maintained
that
didn
want
some
swotty
little
nancy
boy
for
son
anyway
They
also
skated
over
the
accusations
bullying
the
report
boisterous
little
boy
but
wouldn
hurt
fly
Aunt
Petunia
had
said
tearfully
However
the
bottom
the
report
there
were
few
well
chosen
comments
from
the
school
nurse
that
not
even
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
could
explain
away
matter
how
much
Aunt
Petunia
wailed
that
Dudley
was
big
boned
and
that
his
poundage
was
really
puppy
fat
and
that
was
growing
boy
who
needed
plenty
food
the
fact
remained
that
the
school
outfitters
didn
stock
knickerbockers
big
enough
for
him
anymore
The
school
nurse
had
seen
what
Aunt
Petunia
eyes
sharp
when
came
spotting
fingerprints
her
gleaming
walls
and
observing
the
comings
and
goings
the
neighbors
simply
refused
see
that
far
from
needing
extra
nourishment
Dudley
had
reached
roughly
the
size
and
weight
young
killer
whale
after
many
tantrums
after
arguments
that
shook
Harry
bedroom
floor
and
many
tears
from
Aunt
Petunia
the
new
regime
had
begun
The
diet
sheet
that
had
been
sent
the
Smeltings
school
nurse
had
been
taped
the
fridge
which
had
been
emptied
all
Dudley
favorite
things
fizzy
drinks
and
cakes
chocolate
bars
and
burgers
and
filled
instead
with
fruit
and
vegetables
and
the
sorts
things
that
Uncle
Vernon
called
rabbit
food
make
Dudley
feel
better
about
all
Aunt
Petunia
had
insisted
that
the
whole
family
follow
the
diet
too
She
now
passed
grapefruit
quarter
Harry
noticed
that
was
lot
smaller
than
Dudley
Aunt
Petunia
seemed
feet
that
the
best
way
keep
Dudley
morale
was
make
sure
that
did
least
get
more
eat
than
Harry
But
Aunt
Petunia
didn
know
what
was
hidden
under
the
loose
floorboard
upstairs
She
had
idea
that
Harry
was
not
following
the
diet
all
The
moment
had
got
wind
the
fact
that
was
expected
survive
the
summer
carrot
sticks
Harry
had
sent
Hedwig
his
friends
with
pleas
for
help
and
they
had
risen
the
occasion
magnificently
Hedwig
had
returned
from
Hermione
house
with
large
box
stuffed
full
sugar
free
snacks
Hermione
parents
were
dentists
Hagrid
the
Hogwarts
gamekeeper
had
obliged
with
sack
full
his
own
homemade
rock
cakes
Harry
hadn
touched
these
had
had
too
much
experience
Hagrid
cooking
Mrs
Weasley
however
had
sent
the
family
owl
Errol
with
enormous
fruitcake
and
assorted
meat
pies
Poor
Errol
who
was
elderly
and
feeble
had
needed
full
five
days
recover
from
the
journey
And
then
Harry
birthday
which
the
Dursleys
had
completely
ignored
had
received
four
superb
birthday
cakes
one
each
from
Ron
Hermione
Hagrid
and
Sirius
Harry
still
had
two
them
left
and
looking
forward
real
breakfast
when
got
back
upstairs
ate
his
grapefruit
without
complaint
Uncle
Vernon
laid
aside
his
paper
with
deep
sniff
disapproval
and
looked
down
his
own
grapefruit
quarter
this
said
grumpily
Aunt
Petunia
Aunt
Petunia
gave
him
severe
look
and
then
nodded
pointedly
Dudley
who
had
already
finished
his
own
grapefruit
quarter
and
was
eyeing
Harry
with
very
sour
look
his
piggy
little
eyes
Uncle
Vernon
gave
great
sigh
which
ruffled
his
large
bushy
mustache
and
picked
his
spoon
The
doorbell
rang
Uncle
Vernon
heaved
himself
out
his
chair
and
set
off
down
the
hall
Quick
flash
while
his
mother
was
occupied
with
the
kettle
Dudley
stole
the
rest
Uncle
Vernon
grapefruit
Harry
heard
talking
the
door
and
someone
laughing
and
Uncle
Vernon
answering
curtly
Then
the
front
door
closed
and
the
sound
ripping
paper
came
from
the
hall
Aunt
Petunia
set
the
teapot
down
the
table
and
looked
curiously
around
see
where
Uncle
Vernon
had
got
She
didn
have
wait
long
find
out
after
about
minute
was
back
looked
livid
You
barked
Harry
the
living
room
Now
Bewildered
wondering
what
earth
was
supposed
have
done
this
time
Harry
got
and
followed
Uncle
Vernon
out
the
kitchen
and
into
the
next
room
Uncle
Vernon
closed
the
door
sharply
behind
both
them
said
marching
over
the
fireplace
and
turning
face
Harry
though
were
about
pronounce
him
under
arrest
Harry
would
have
dearly
loved
have
said
what
but
didn
feel
that
Uncle
Vernon
temper
should
tested
this
early
the
morning
especially
when
was
already
under
severe
strain
from
lack
food
therefore
settled
for
looking
politely
puzzled
This
just
arrived
said
Uncle
Vernon
brandished
piece
purple
writing
paper
Harry
letter
About
you
Harry
confusion
increased
Who
would
writing
Uncle
Vernon
about
him
Who
did
know
who
sent
letters
the
postman
Uncle
Vernon
glared
Harry
then
looked
down
the
letter
and
began
read
aloud
Dear
and
Mrs
Dursley
have
never
been
introduced
but
sure
you
have
heard
great
deal
from
Harry
about
son
Ron
Harry
might
have
told
you
the
final
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
takes
place
this
Monday
night
and
husband
Arthur
has
just
managed
get
prime
tickets
through
his
connections
the
Department
Magical
Games
and
Sports
hope
you
will
allow
take
Harry
the
match
this
really
once
lifetime
opportunity
Britain
hasn
hosted
the
cup
for
thirty
years
and
tickets
are
extremely
hard
come
would
course
glad
have
Harry
stay
for
the
remainder
the
summer
holidays
and
see
him
safely
onto
the
train
back
school
would
best
for
Harry
send
your
answer
quickly
possible
the
normal
way
because
the
Muggle
postman
has
never
delivered
our
house
and
not
sure
even
knows
where
Hoping
see
Harry
soon
Yours
sincerely
Molly
Weasley
hope
put
enough
stamps
Uncle
Vernon
finished
reading
put
his
hand
back
into
his
breast
pocket
and
drew
out
something
else
Look
this
growled
held
the
envelope
which
Mrs
Weasley
letter
had
come
and
Harry
had
fight
down
laugh
Every
bit
was
covered
stamps
except
for
square
inch
the
front
into
which
Mrs
Weasley
had
squeezed
the
Dursleys
address
minute
writing
She
did
put
enough
stamps
then
said
Harry
trying
sound
though
Mrs
Weasley
was
mistake
anyone
could
make
His
uncle
eyes
flashed
The
postman
noticed
said
through
gritted
teeth
Very
interested
know
where
this
letter
came
from
was
That
why
rang
the
doorbell
Seemed
think
was
funny
Harry
didn
say
anything
Other
people
might
not
understand
why
Uncle
Vernon
was
making
fuss
about
too
many
stamps
but
Harry
had
lived
with
the
Dursleys
too
long
not
know
how
touchy
they
were
about
anything
even
slightly
out
the
ordinary
Their
worst
fear
was
that
someone
would
find
out
that
they
were
connected
however
distantly
with
people
like
Mrs
Weasley
Uncle
Vernon
was
still
glaring
Harry
who
tried
keep
his
expression
neutral
didn
say
anything
stupid
might
just
for
the
treat
lifetime
waited
for
Uncle
Vernon
say
something
but
merely
continued
glare
Harry
decided
break
the
silence
can
then
asked
slight
spasm
crossed
Uncle
Vernon
large
purple
face
The
mustache
bristled
Harry
thought
knew
what
was
going
behind
the
mustache
furious
battle
two
Uncle
Vernon
most
fundamental
instincts
came
into
conflict
Allowing
Harry
would
make
Harry
happy
something
Uncle
Vernon
had
struggled
against
for
thirteen
years
the
other
hand
allowing
Harry
disappear
the
Weasleys
for
the
rest
the
summer
would
get
rid
him
two
weeks
earlier
than
anyone
could
have
hoped
and
Uncle
Vernon
hated
having
Harry
the
house
give
himself
thinking
time
seemed
looked
down
Mrs
Weasley
letter
again
Who
this
woman
said
staring
the
signature
with
distaste
You
seen
her
said
Harry
She
friend
Ron
mother
she
was
meeting
him
off
the
Hog
off
the
school
train
the
end
last
term
had
almost
said
Hogwarts
Express
and
that
was
sure
way
get
his
uncle
temper
Nobody
ever
mentioned
the
name
Harry
school
aloud
the
Dursley
household
Uncle
Vernon
screwed
his
enormous
face
though
trying
remember
something
very
unpleasant
Dumpy
sort
woman
growled
finally
Load
children
with
red
hair
Harry
frowned
thought
was
bit
rich
Uncle
Vernon
call
anyone
dumpy
when
his
own
son
Dudley
had
finally
achieved
what
been
threatening
since
the
age
three
and
become
wider
than
was
tall
Uncle
Vernon
was
perusing
the
letter
again
Quidditch
muttered
under
his
breath
Quidditch
what
this
rubbish
Harry
felt
second
stab
annoyance
sport
said
shortly
Played
broom
All
right
all
right
said
Uncle
Vernon
loudly
Harry
saw
with
some
satisfaction
that
his
uncle
looked
vaguely
panicky
Apparently
his
nerves
couldn
stand
the
sound
the
word
broomsticks
his
living
room
took
refuge
perusing
the
letter
again
Harry
saw
his
lips
form
the
words
send
your
answer
the
normal
way
scowled
What
does
she
mean
the
normal
way
spat
Normal
for
said
Harry
and
before
his
uncle
could
stop
him
added
you
know
owl
post
That
what
normal
for
wizards
Uncle
Vernon
looked
outraged
Harry
had
just
uttered
disgusting
swearword
Shaking
with
anger
shot
nervous
look
through
the
window
though
expecting
see
some
the
neighbors
with
their
ears
pressed
against
the
glass
How
many
times
have
tell
you
not
mention
that
unnaturalness
under
roof
hissed
his
face
now
rich
plum
color
You
stand
there
the
clothes
Petunia
and
have
put
your
ungrateful
back
Only
after
Dudley
finished
with
them
said
Harry
coldly
and
indeed
was
dressed
sweatshirt
large
for
him
that
had
had
roll
back
the
sleeves
five
times
able
use
his
hands
and
which
fell
past
the
knees
his
extremely
baggy
jeans
will
not
spoken
like
that
said
Uncle
Vernon
trembling
with
rage
But
Harry
wasn
going
stand
for
this
Gone
were
the
days
when
had
been
forced
take
every
single
one
the
Dursleys
stupid
rules
wasn
following
Dudley
diet
and
wasn
going
let
Uncle
Vernon
stop
him
from
going
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
not
could
help
Harry
took
deep
steadying
breath
and
then
said
Okay
can
see
the
World
Cup
Can
now
then
Only
got
letter
Sirius
want
finish
You
know
godfather
had
done
had
said
the
magic
words
Now
watched
the
purple
recede
blotchily
from
Uncle
Vernon
face
making
look
like
badly
mixed
black
currant
ice
cream
You
you
writing
him
are
you
said
Uncle
Vernon
would
calm
voice
but
Harry
had
seen
the
pupils
his
tiny
eyes
contract
with
sudden
fear
Well
yeah
said
Harry
casually
been
while
since
heard
from
and
you
know
doesn
might
start
thinking
something
wrong
stopped
there
enjoy
the
effect
these
words
could
almost
see
the
cogs
working
under
Uncle
Vernon
thick
dark
neatly
parted
hair
tried
stop
Harry
writing
Sirius
Sirius
would
think
Harry
was
being
mistreated
told
Harry
couldn
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
Harry
would
write
and
tell
Sirius
who
would
know
Harry
was
being
mistreated
There
was
only
one
thing
for
Uncle
Vernon
Harry
could
see
the
conclusion
forming
his
uncle
mind
though
the
great
mustached
face
were
transparent
Harry
tried
not
smile
keep
his
own
face
blank
possible
And
then
Well
all
right
then
You
can
this
ruddy
this
stupid
this
World
Cup
thing
You
write
and
tell
these
these
Weasleys
they
pick
you
mind
haven
got
time
dropping
you
off
all
over
the
country
And
you
can
spend
the
rest
the
summer
there
And
you
can
tell
your
your
godfather
tell
him
tell
him
you
going
Okay
then
said
Harry
brightly
turned
and
walked
toward
the
living
room
door
fighting
the
urge
jump
into
the
air
and
whoop
was
going
was
going
the
Weasleys
was
going
watch
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
Outside
the
hall
nearly
ran
into
Dudley
who
had
been
lurking
behind
the
door
clearly
hoping
overhear
Harry
being
told
off
looked
shocked
see
the
broad
grin
Harry
face
That
was
excellent
breakfast
wasn
said
Harry
feel
really
full
don
you
Laughing
the
astonished
look
Dudley
face
Harry
took
the
stairs
three
time
and
hurled
himself
back
into
his
bedroom
The
first
thing
saw
was
that
Hedwig
was
back
She
was
sitting
her
cage
staring
Harry
with
her
enormous
amber
eyes
and
clicking
her
beak
the
way
that
meant
she
was
annoyed
about
something
Exactly
what
was
annoying
her
became
apparent
almost
once
OUCH
said
Harry
what
appeared
small
gray
feathery
tennis
ball
collided
with
the
side
his
head
Harry
massaged
the
spot
furiously
looking
see
what
had
hit
him
and
saw
minute
owl
small
enough
fit
into
the
palm
his
hand
whizzing
excitedly
around
the
room
like
loose
firework
Harry
then
realized
that
the
owl
had
dropped
letter
his
feet
Harry
bent
down
recognized
Ron
handwriting
then
tore
open
the
envelope
Inside
was
hastily
scribbled
note
Harry

Pig

Harry
stared
the
word
Pig
then
looked
the
tiny
owl
now
zooming
around
the
light
fixture
the
ceiling
had
never
seen
anything
that
looked
less
like
pig
Maybe
couldn
read
Ron
writing
went
back
the
letter

unless

the
pants
bored
off
you
See

Ron
Calm
down
Harry
said
the
small
owl
flew
low
over
his
head
twittering
madly
with
what
Harry
could
only
assume
was
pride
having
delivered
the
letter
the
right
person
Come
here
need
you
take
answer
back
The
owl
fluttered
down
top
Hedwig
cage
Hedwig
looked
coldly
though
daring
try
and
come
any
closer
Harry
seized
his
eagle
feather
quill
once
more
grabbed
fresh
piece
parchment
and
wrote
Ron
all
okay
the
Muggles
say
can
come
See
you
five
clock
tomorrow
Can
wait
Harry
folded
this
note
very
small
and
with
immense
difficulty
tied
the
tiny
owl
leg
hopped
the
spot
with
excitement
The
moment
the
note
was
secure
the
owl
was
off
again
zoomed
out
the
window
and
out
sight
Harry
turned
Hedwig
Feeling
long

Harry
told
her
She
nipped
his
finger
affectionately
then
with
soft
swooshing
noise
spread
her
enormous
wings
and
soared
out
the
open
window
Harry
watched
her
out
sight
then
crawled
under
his
bed
wrenched
the
loose
floorboard
and
pulled
out
large
chunk

cake

there

CHAPTER
FOUR
BACK
THE
BURROW
twelve
clock
the
next
day
Harry
school
trunk
was
packed
with
his
school
things
and
all
his
most
prized
possessions
the
Invisibility
Cloak
had
inherited
from
his
father
the
broomstick
had
gotten
from
Sirius
the
enchanted
map
Hogwarts
had
been
given
Fred
and
George
Weasley
last
year
had
emptied
his
hiding
place
under
the
loose
floorboard
all
food
double
checked
every
nook
and
cranny
his
bedroom
for
forgotten
spellbooks
quills
and
taken
down
the
chart
the
wall
counting
down
the
days
September
the
first
which
liked
cross
off
the
days
remaining
until
his
return
Hogwarts
The
atmosphere
inside
number
four
Privet
Drive
was
extremely
tense
The
imminent
arrival
their
house
assortment
wizards
was
making
the
Dursleys
uptight
and
irritable
Uncle
Vernon
had
looked
downright
alarmed
when
Harry
informed
him
that
the
Weasleys
would
arriving
five
clock
the
very
next
day
hope
you
told
them
dress
properly
these
people
snarled
once
seen
the
sort
stuff
your
lot
wear
They
better
have
the
decency
put
normal
clothes
that
all
Harry
felt
slight
sense
foreboding
had
rarely
seen
Mrs
Weasley
wearing
anything
that
the
Dursleys
would
call
normal
Their
children
might
don
Muggle
clothing
during
the
holidays
but
and
Mrs
Weasley
usually
wore
long
robes
varying
states
shabbiness
Harry
wasn
bothered
about
what
the
neighbors
would
think
but
was
anxious
about
how
rude
the
Dursleys
might
the
Weasleys
they
turned
looking
like
their
worst
idea
wizards
Uncle
Vernon
had
put
his
best
suit
some
people
this
might
have
looked
like
gesture
welcome
but
Harry
knew
was
because
Uncle
Vernon
wanted
look
impressive
and
intimidating
Dudley
the
other
hand
looked
somehow
diminished
This
was
not
because
the
diet
was
last
taking
effect
but
due
fright
Dudley
had
emerged
from
his
last
encounter
with
fully
grown
wizard
with
curly
pig
tail
poking
out
the
seat
his
trousers
and
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
had
had
pay
for
its
removal
private
hospital
London
wasn
altogether
surprising
therefore
that
Dudley
kept
running
his
hand
nervously
over
his
backside
and
walking
sideways
from
room
room
not
present
the
same
target
the
enemy
Lunch
was
almost
silent
meal
Dudley
didn
even
protest
the
food
cottage
cheese
and
grated
celery
Aunt
Petunia
wasn
eating
anything
all
Her
arms
were
folded
her
lips
were
pursed
and
she
seemed
chewing
her
tongue
though
biting
back
the
furious
diatribe
she
longed
throw
Harry
They
driving
course
Uncle
Vernon
barked
across
the
table
said
Harry
hadn
thought
that
How
were
the
Weasleys
going
pick
him
They
didn
have
car
anymore
the
old
Ford
Anglia
they
had
once
owned
was
currently
running
wild
the
Forbidden
Forest
Hogwarts
But
Weasley
had
borrowed
Ministry
Magic
car
last
year
possibly
would
the
same
today
think
said
Harry
Uncle
Vernon
snorted
into
his
mustache
Normally
Uncle
Vernon
would
have
asked
what
car
Weasley
drove
tended
judge
other
men
how
big
and
expensive
their
cars
were
But
Harry
doubted
whether
Uncle
Vernon
would
have
taken
Weasley
even
drove
Ferrari
Harry
spent
most
the
afternoon
his
bedroom
couldn
stand
watching
Aunt
Petunia
peer
out
through
the
net
curtains
every
few
seconds
though
there
had
been
warning
about
escaped
rhinoceros
Finally
quarter
five
Harry
went
back
downstairs
and
into
the
living
room
Aunt
Petunia
was
compulsively
straightening
cushions
Uncle
Vernon
was
pretending
read
the
paper
but
his
tiny
eyes
were
not
moving
and
Harry
was
sure
was
really
listening
with
all
his
might
for
the
sound
approaching
car
Dudley
was
crammed
into
armchair
his
porky
hands
beneath
him
clamped
firmly
around
his
bottom
Harry
couldn
take
the
tension
left
the
room
and
went
and
sat
the
stairs
the
hall
his
eyes
his
watch
and
his
heart
pumping
fast
from
excitement
and
nerves
But
five
clock
came
and
then
went
Uncle
Vernon
perspiring
slightly
his
suit
opened
the
front
door
peered
and
down
the
street
then
withdrew
his
head
quickly
They
late
snarled
Harry
know
said
Harry
Maybe
the
traffic
bad
something
Ten
past
five
then
quarter
past
five
Harry
was
starting
feel
anxious
himself
now
half
past
heard
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
conversing
terse
mutters
the
living
room
consideration
all
might
had
engagement
Maybe
they
think
they
get
invited
dinner
they
late
Well
they
most
certainly
won
said
Uncle
Vernon
and
Harry
heard
him
stand
and
start
pacing
the
living
room
They
take
the
boy
and
there
hanging
around
That
they
coming
all
Probably
mistaken
the
day
daresay
their
kind
don
set
much
store
punctuality
Either
that
they
drive
some
tin
pot
car
that
broken
AAAAAAAARRRRRGH
Harry
jumped
From
the
other
side
the
living
room
door
came
the
sounds
the
three
Dursleys
scrambling
panic
stricken
across
the
room
Next
moment
Dudley
came
flying
into
the
hall
looking
terrified
What
happened
said
Harry
What
the
matter
But
Dudley
didn
seem
able
speak
Hands
still
clamped
over
his
buttocks
waddled
fast
could
into
the
kitchen
Harry
hurried
into
the
living
room
Loud
bangings
and
scrapings
were
coming
from
behind
the
Dursleys
boarded
fireplace
which
had
fake
coal
fire
plugged
front
What
gasped
Aunt
Petunia
who
had
backed
into
the
wall
and
was
staring
terrified
toward
the
fire
What
Vernon
But
they
were
left
doubt
barely
second
longer
Voices
could
heard
from
inside
the
blocked
fireplace
Ouch
Fred
back
back
there
been
some
kind
mistake
tell
George
not
OUCH
George
there
room
back
quickly
and
tell
Ron
Maybe
Harry
can
hear
Dad
maybe
able
let
out
There
was
loud
hammering
fists
the
boards
behind
the
electric
fire
Harry
Harry
can
you
hear
The
Dursleys
rounded
Harry
like
pair
angry
wolverines
What
this
growled
Uncle
Vernon
What
going
They
they
tried
get
here
Floo
powder
said
Harry
fighting
mad
desire
laugh
They
can
travel
fire
only

blocked
the
fireplace
hang
approached
the
fireplace
and
called
through
the
boards
Weasley
Can
you
hear
The
hammering
stopped
Somebody
inside
the
chimney
piece
said
Shh
Weasley
Harry
the
fireplace
has
been
blocked
You
won
able
get
through
there
Damn
said
Weasley
voice
What
earth
did
they
want
block
the
fireplace
for
They
got
electric
fire
Harry
explained
Really
said
Weasley
voice
excitedly
Eclectic

say
With
plug
Gracious
must
see
that
Let
think
ouch
Ron
Ron
voice
now
joined
the
others
What
are
doing
here
Has
something
gone
wrong
Ron
came
Fred
voice
very
sarcastically
this
exactly
where
wanted
end
Yeah
having
the
time
our
lives
here
said
George
whose
voice
sounded
muffled
though
was
squashed
against
the
wall
Boys
boys
said
Weasley
vaguely
trying
think
what
Yes
only
way
Stand
back
Harry
Harry
retreated
the
sofa
Uncle
Vernon
however
moved
forward
Wait
moment
bellowed
the
fire
What
exactly
are
you
going
BANG
The
electric
fire
shot
across
the
room
the
boarded
fireplace
burst
outward
expelling
Weasley
Fred
George
and
Ron
cloud
rubble
and
loose
chippings
Aunt
Petunia
shrieked
and
fell
backward
over
the
coffee
table
Uncle
Vernon
caught
her
before
she
hit
the
floor
and
gaped
speechless
the
Weasleys
all
whom
had
bright
red
hair
including
Fred
and
George
who
were
identical
the
last
freckle
That
better
panted
Weasley
brushing
dust
from
his
long
green
robes
and
straightening
his
glasses
you
must
Harry
aunt
and
uncle
Tall
thin
and
balding
moved
toward
Uncle
Vernon
his
hand
outstretched
but
Uncle
Vernon
backed
away
several
paces
dragging
Aunt
Petunia
Words
utterly
failed
Uncle
Vernon
His
best
suit
was
covered
white
dust
which
had
settled
his
hair
and
mustache
and
made
him
look
though
had
just
aged
thirty
years
yes
sorry
about
that
said
Weasley
lowering
his
hand
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
the
blasted
fireplace
all
fault
just
didn
occur
that
wouldn
able
get

Disapparate
Harry
was
ready
bet
that
the
Dursleys
hadn
understood
single
word
this
They
were
still
gaping
Weasley
thunderstruck
Aunt
Petunia
staggered
upright
again
and
hid
behind
Uncle
Vernon
Hello
Harry
said
Weasley
brightly
Got
your
trunk
ready
upstairs
said
Harry
grinning
back
get
said
Fred
once
Winking
Harry
and
George
left
the
room
They
knew
where
Harry
bedroom
was
having
once
rescued
him
from
the
dead
night
Harry
suspected
that
Fred
and
George
were
hoping
for
glimpse
Dudley
they
had
heard
lot
about
him
from
Harry
Well
said
Weasley
swinging
his
arms
slightly
while
tried
find
words
break
the
very
nasty
silence
Very
erm
very
nice
place
you
got
here
the
usually
spotless
living
room
was
now
covered
dust
and
bits
brick
this
remark
didn
down
too
well
with
the
Dursleys
Uncle
Vernon
face
purpled
once
more
and
Aunt
Petunia
started
chewing
her
tongue
again
However
they
seemed
too
scared
actually
say
anything
Weasley
was
looking
around
loved
everything
with
Muggles
Harry
could
see
him
itching
and
examine
the
television
and
the
video
recorder
They
run
off
eckeltricity
they
said
knowledgeably
yes
can
see
the
plugs
collect
plugs
added
Uncle
Vernon
And
batteries
Got
very
large
collection
batteries
wife
thinks
mad
but
there
you
are
Uncle
Vernon
clearly
thought
Weasley
was
mad
too
moved
ever
slightly
the
right
screening
Aunt
Petunia
from
view
though
thought
Weasley
might
suddenly
run
them
and
attack
Dudley
suddenly
reappeared
the
room
Harry
could
hear
the
clunk
his
trunk
the
stairs
and
knew
that
the
sounds
had
scared
Dudley
out
the
kitchen
Dudley
edged
along
the
wall
gazing
Weasley
with
terrified
eyes
and
attempted
conceal
himself
behind
his
mother
and
father
Unfortunately
Uncle
Vernon
bulk
while
sufficient
hide
bony
Aunt
Petunia
was
nowhere
near
enough
conceal
Dudley
this
your
cousin
Harry
said
Weasley
taking
another
brave
stab
making
conversation
Yep
said
Harry
that
Dudley
and
Ron
exchanged
glances
and
then
quickly
looked
away
from
each
other
the
temptation
burst
out
laughing
was
almost
overwhelming
Dudley
was
still
clutching
his
bottom
though
afraid
might
fall
off
Weasley
however
seemed
genuinely
concerned
Dudley
peculiar
behavior
Indeed
from
the
tone
his
voice
when
next
spoke
Harry
was
quite
sure
that
Weasley
thought
Dudley
was
quite
mad
the
Dursleys
thought
was
except
that
Weasley
felt
sympathy
rather
than
fear
Having
good
holiday
Dudley
said
kindly
Dudley
whimpered
Harry
saw
his
hands
tighten
still
harder
over
his
massive
backside
Fred
and
George
came
back
into
the
room
carrying
Harry
school
trunk
They
glanced
around
they
entered
and
spotted
Dudley
Their
faces
cracked
into
identical
evil
grins
right
said
Weasley
Better
get
cracking
then
pushed
the
sleeves
his
robes
and
took
out
his
wand
Harry
saw
the
Dursleys
draw
back
against
the
wall
one
Incendio
said
Weasley
pointing
his
wand
the
hole
the
wall
behind
him
Flames
rose
once
the
fireplace
crackling
merrily
though
they
had
been
burning
for
hours
Weasley
took
small
drawstring
bag
from
his
pocket
untied
took
pinch
the
powder
inside
and
threw
onto
the
flames
which
turned
emerald
green
and
roared
higher
than
ever
Off
you
then
Fred
said
Weasley
Coming
said
Fred
hang
bag
sweets
had
spilled
out
Fred
pocket
and
the
contents
were
now
rolling
every
direction
big
fat
toffees
brightly
colored
wrappers
Fred
scrambled
around
cramming
them
back
into
his
pocket
then
gave
the
Dursleys
cheery
wave
stepped
forward
and
walked
right
into
the
fire
saying
the
Burrow
Aunt
Petunia
gave
little
shuddering
gasp
There
was
whooshing
sound
and
Fred
vanished
Right
then
George
said
Weasley
you
and
the
trunk
Harry
helped
George
carry
the
trunk
forward
into
the
flames
and
turn
onto
its
end
that
could
hold
better
Then
with
second
whoosh
George
had
cried
the
Burrow
and
vanished
too
Ron
you
next
said
Weasley
See
you
said
Ron
brightly
the
Dursleys
grinned
broadly
Harry
then
stepped
into
the
fire
shouted
the
Burrow
and
disappeared
Now
Harry
and
Weasley
alone
remained
Well
bye
then
Harry
said
the
Dursleys
They
didn
say
anything
all
Harry
moved
toward
the
fire
but
just
reached
the
edge
the
hearth
Weasley
put
out
hand
and
held
him
back
was
looking
the
Dursleys
amazement
Harry
said
good
bye
you
said
Didn
you
hear
him
doesn
matter
Harry
muttered
Weasley
Honestly
don
care
Weasley
did
not
remove
his
hand
from
Harry
shoulder
You
aren
going
see
your
nephew
till
next
summer
said
Uncle
Vernon
mild
indignation
Surely
you
going
say
good
bye
Uncle
Vernon
face
worked
furiously
The
idea
being
taught
consideration
man
who
had
just
blasted
away
half
his
living
room
wall
seemed
causing
him
intense
suffering
But
Weasley
wand
was
still
his
hand
and
Uncle
Vernon
tiny
eyes
darted
once
before
said
very
resentfully
Good
bye
then
See
you
said
Harry
putting
one
foot
forward
into
the
green
flames
which
felt
pleasantly
like
warm
breath
that
moment
however
horrible
gagging
sound
erupted
behind
him
and
Aunt
Petunia
started
scream
Harry
wheeled
around
Dudley
was
longer
standing
behind
his
parents
was
kneeling
beside
the
coffee
table
and
was
gagging
and
sputtering
foot
long
purple
slimy
thing
that
was
protruding
from
his
mouth
One
bewildered
second
later
Harry
realized
that
the
foot
long
thing
was
Dudley
tongue
and
that
brightly
colored
toffee
wrapper
lay
the
floor
before
him
Aunt
Petunia
hurled
herself
onto
the
ground
beside
Dudley
seized
the
end
his
swollen
tongue
and
attempted
wrench
out
his
mouth
unsurprisingly
Dudley
yelled
and
sputtered
worse
than
ever
trying
fight
her
off
Uncle
Vernon
was
bellowing
and
waving
his
arms
around
and
Weasley
had
shout
make
himself
heard
Not
worry
can
sort
him
out
yelled
advancing
Dudley
with
his
wand
outstretched
but
Aunt
Petunia
screamed
worse
than
ever
and
threw
herself
top
Dudley
shielding
him
from
Weasley
really
said
Weasley
desperately
simple
process
was
the
toffee
son
Fred
real
practical
joker
but
only
Engorgement
Charm
least
think
please
can
correct
But
far
from
being
reassured
the
Dursleys
became
more
panic
stricken
Aunt
Petunia
was
sobbing
hysterically
tugging
Dudley
tongue
though
determined
rip
out
Dudley
appeared
suffocating
under
the
combined
pressure
his
mother
and
his
tongue
and
Uncle
Vernon
who
had
lost
control
completely
seized
china
figure
from
top
the
sideboard
and
threw
very
hard
Weasley
who
ducked
causing
the
ornament
shatter
the
blasted
fireplace
Now
really
said
Weasley
angrily
brandishing
his
wand
trying
help
Bellowing
like
wounded
hippo
Uncle
Vernon
snatched
another
ornament
Harry
Just
Weasley
shouted
his
wand
Uncle
Vernon
sort
this
out
Harry
didn
want
miss
the
fun
but
Uncle
Vernon
second
ornament
narrowly
missed
his
left
ear
and
balance
thought
best
leave
the
situation
Weasley
stepped
into
the
fire
looking
over
his
shoulder
said
the
Burrow
His
last
fleeting
glimpse
the
living
room
was
Weasley
blasting
third
ornament
out
Uncle
Vernon
hand
with
his
wand
Aunt
Petunia
screaming
and
lying
top
Dudley
and
Dudley
tongue
lolling
around
like
great
slimy
python
But
next
moment
Harry
had
begun
spin
very
fast
and
the
Dursleys
living
room
was
whipped
out
sight
rush
emerald
green
flames
CHAPTER
FIVE
WEASLEYS
WIZARD
WHEEZES
Harry
spun
faster
and
faster
elbows
tucked
tightly
his
sides
blurred
fireplaces
flashing
past
him
until
started
feel
sick
and
closed
his
eyes
Then
when
last
felt
himself
slowing
down
threw
out
his
hands
and
came
halt
time
prevent
himself
from
falling
face
forward
out
the
Weasleys
kitchen
fire
Did

said
Fred
excitedly
holding
out
hand
pull
Harry
his
fee
Yeah
said
Harry
straightening
What
was
Ton
Tongue
Toffee
said
Fred
brightly
George
and
invented
them
and
been
looking
for
someone
test
them
all
summer
The
tiny
kitchen
exploded
with
laughter
Harry
looked
around
and
saw
that
Ron
and
George
were
sitting
the
scrubbed
wooden
table
with
two
red
haired
people
Harry
had
never
seen
before
though
knew
immediately
who
they
must
Bill
and
Charlie
the
two
eldest
Weasley
brothers
How
you
doing
Harry
said
the
nearer
the
two
grinning
him
and
holding
out
large
hand
which
Harry
shook
feeling
calluses
and
blisters
under
his
fingers
This
had
Charlie
who
worked
with
dragons
Romania
Charlie
was
built
like
the
twins
shorter
and
stockier
than
Percy
and
Ron
who
were
both
long
and
lanky
had
broad
good
natured
face
which
was
weather
beaten
and
freckly
that
looked
almost
tanned
his
arms
were
muscular
and
one
them
had
large
shiny
burn
Bill
got
his
feet
smiling
and
also
shook
Harry
hand
Bill
came
something
surprise
Harry
knew
that
worked
for
the
wizarding
bank
Gringotts
and
that
Bill
had
been
Head
Boy
Hogwarts
Harry
had
always
imagined
Bill
older
version
Percy
fussy
about
rule
breaking
and
fond
bossing
everyone
around
However
Bill
was
there
was
other
word
for
cool
was
tall
with
long
hair
that
had
tied
back
ponytail
was
wearing
earring
with
what
looked
like
fang
dangling
from
Bill
clothes
would
not
have
looked
out
place
rock
concert
except
that
Harry
recognized
his
boots
made
not
leather
but
dragon
hide
Before
any
them
could
say
anything
else
there
was
faint
popping
noise
and
Weasley
appeared
out
thin
air
George
shoulder
was
looking
angrier
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
him
That
wasn
funny
Fred
shouted
What
earth
did
you
give
that
Muggle
boy
didn
give
him
anything
said
Fred
with
another
evil
grin
just
dropped
was
his
fault
went
and
ate
never
told
him
You
dropped
purpose
roared
Weasley
You
knew

knew

diet
How
big
did
his
tongue
get
George
asked
eagerly
was
four
feet
long
before
his
parents
would
let
shrink
Harry
and
the
Weasleys
roared
with
laughter
again
isn
funny
Weasley
shouted
That
sort
behavior
seriously
undermines
wizard
Muggle
relations
spend
half
life
campaigning
against
the
mistreatment
Muggles
and
own
sons
didn
give
him
because
Muggle
said
Fred
indignantly
gave
him
because
great
bullying
git
said
George
Isn
Harry
Yeah
Weasley
said
Harry
earnestly
That
not
the
point
raged
Weasley
You
wait
until
tell
your
mother
Tell
what
said
voice
behind
them
Mrs
Weasley
had
just
entered
the
kitchen
She
was
short
plump
woman
with
very
kind
face
though
her
eyes
were
presently
narrowed
with
suspicion
hello
Harry
dear
she
said
spotting
him
and
smiling
Then
her
eyes
snapped
back
her
husband
Tell
what
Arthur
Weasley
hesitated
Harry
could
tell
that
however
angry
was
with
Fred
and
George
hadn
really
intended
tell
Mrs
Weasley
what
had
happened
There
was
silence
while
Weasley
eyed
his
wife
nervously
Then
two
girls
appeared
the
kitchen
doorway
behind
Mrs
Weasley
One
with
very
bushy
brown
hair
and
rather
large
front
teeth
was
Harry
and
Ron
friend
Hermione
Granger
The
other
who
was
small
and
red
haired
was
Ron
younger
sister
Ginny
Both
them
smiled
Harry
who
grinned
back
which
made
Ginny
scarlet
she
had
been
very
taken
with
Harry
ever
since
his
first
visit
the
Burrow
Tell
what
Arthur
Mrs
Weasley
repeated
dangerous
sort
voice
nothing
Molly
mumbled
Weasley
Fred
and
George
just
but
had
words
with
them
What

they
done
this
time
said
Mrs
Weasley
got

Weasleys

Hermione
pointedly
said
Ron
cottoning
Right

said
George
You

where
you
are
snarled
Mrs
Weasley
Harry
and
Ron
edged
out
the
kitchen
and
they
Hermione
and
Ginny
set
off
along
the
narrow
hallway
and
the
rickety
staircase
that
zigzagged
through
the
house
the
upper
stories
What
are
Weasleys
Wizard
Wheezes
Harry
asked
they
climbed
Ron
and
Ginny
both
laughed
although
Hermione

Mum

Ron
quietly
Great

brilliant
never
knew
they
been
inventing
all
that
been
hearing
explosions
out
their
room
for
ages
but
never
thought
they
were
actually
making
things
said
Ginny
thought
they
just
liked
the
noise
Only
most
the
stuff
well
all
really
was
bit
dangerous
said
Ron
and
you
know
they
were
planning

Hogwarts
make
some
money
and
Mum
went
mad
them
Told
them
they
weren
allowed

any
more
and
burned
all
the
order
forms
She
furious
them
anyway
They
didn
get
many
she
expected
were
Ordinary
Wizarding
Levels
the
examinations
Hogwarts
students
took
the
age
fifteen
And
then
there
was
this
big
row
Ginny
said
because
Mum
wants
them
into
the
Ministry
Magic
like
Dad
and
they
told
her
all
they
want
open
joke
shop
Just
then
door
the
second
landing
opened
and
face
poked
out
wearing
horn
rimmed
glasses
and
very
annoyed
expression
Percy
said
Harry

said
Percy

wondering

Harry

Percy
smugly
trying
standardize
cauldron

Some

Ron
Front

Daily
Prophet

Percy
went
slightly
pink
You
might
sneer
Ron
said
heatedly
but
unless
some
sort
international
law
imposed
might
well
find
the
market
flooded
with
flimsy
shallow
bottomed
products
that
seriously
endanger
Yeah
yeah
all
right
said
Ron
and
started
off
upstairs
again
Percy
slammed
his
bedroom
door
shut
Harry
Hermione
and
Ginny
followed
Ron
three
more
flights
stairs
shouts
from
the
kitchen
below
echoed
them
sounded
though
Weasley
had
told
Mrs
Weasley
about
the
toffees
The
room

top
the
house
where
Ron
slept
looked
much
had
the

Privet
Drive

Ron
edging

way
between

the
four
beds
that
had

into
the

Ron

And

Hermes

Pigwidgeon
zoomed
happily
around
his
cage
hooting
shrilly
Harry
knew
Ron
too
well
take
him
seriously
had
moaned
continually
about
his
old
rat
Scabbers
but
had
been
most
upset
when
Hermione

eaten
him
Where

Harry
asked
Hermione
now
Out

garden

she
said

Percy
enjoying
work
then
said
Harry
sitting
down
one
the
beds
and
watching
the
Chudley
Cannons
zooming
and
out
the
posters
the
ceiling
Enjoying

Ron
darkly

According

Harry
They

began
but
look
from
Hermione

silent
Harry
knew
Ron
had
been
about
ask
about
Sirius
Ron
and
Hermione
had
been
deeply
involved
helping
Sirius
escape
from
the
Ministry
Magic
that
they
were
almost
concerned
about
Harry
godfather
was
However
discussing
him
front
Ginny
was
bad
idea
Nobody
but
themselves
and
Professor
Dumbledore
knew
about
how
Sirius
had
escaped
believed
his
innocence
think
they
stopped
arguing
said
Hermione
cover
the
awkward
moment
because
Ginny
was
looking
curiously
from
Ron
Harry
Shall

and
help
your
mum
with

said
Ron
The
four
them
left
Ron
room
and
went
back
downstairs
find
Mrs
Weasley
alone
the
kitchen
looking
extremely
bad
tempered
eating
out
the
garden
she
said
when
they
came

Bill
and
Charlie

she
said
Ron
and
Harry
pointing
her
wand
little
more
vigorously
than
she
had
intended
pile
potatoes
the
sink
which
shot
out
their
skins
fast
that
they
ricocheted
off
the
walls
and
ceiling
for
heaven
sake
she
snapped
now
directing
her
wand
dustpan
which
hopped
off
the
sideboard
and
started
skating
across
the
floor
scooping
the
potatoes
Those
two
she
burst
out
savagely
now
pulling
pots
and
pans
out
cupboard
and
Harry
knew
she
meant
Fred
and
George
don
know
what
going
happen
them

unless
you
count
making
much
trouble
they
possibly

Mrs
Weasley
slammed
large
copper
saucepan
down
the
kitchen
table
and
began
wave
her
wand
around
inside
creamy
sauce
poured
from
the
wand
tip
she
stirred
not
though
they
haven
got
brains
she
continued
irritably
taking
the
saucepan
over
the
stove
and
lighting
with
further
poke
her
wand
but
they
wasting
them
and
unless
they
pull
themselves
together
soon
they
real

Mrs
Weasley
jabbed
her
wand

cutlery
drawer
which
shot
open
Harry
and
Ron
both
jumped
out
the
way
several
knives
soared
out

across
the
kitchen
and
began
chopping
the
potatoes
which
had
just
been
tipped
back
into
the
sink
the
dustpan

Mrs

putting

and
starting

out
still
more
saucepans

the
same
for
years
one
thing
after
another
and
they
won
listen
NOT

She
had
picked
her
wand
from
the
table
and
had
emitted
loud
squeak
and
turned
into
giant
rubber
mouse
One
their
fake
wands
again
she
shouted
How
many
times

told
them

around
She
grabbed
her
real
wand
and
turned
around

Ron
said
hurriedly
Harry
seizing
handful
cutlery
from
the
open
drawer
let
and
help
Bill
and
Charlie
They
left
Mrs
Weasley
and
headed
out
the
back
door
into
the
yard
They
had
only
gone
few
paces
when
Hermione
bandy
legged
ginger
cat
Crookshanks
came
pelting
out
the
garden
bottle
brush
tail
held
high
the
air
chasing
what
looked
like
muddy
potato
legs
Harry
recognized
instantly
gnome
Barely
ten
inches
high
its
horny
little
feet
pattered
very
fast
sprinted
across
the
yard
and
dived
headlong
into
one
the
Wellington
boots
that
lay
scattered
around
the
door
Harry
could
hear
the
gnome
giggling
madly
Crookshanks
inserted
paw
into
the
boot
trying
reach
Meanwhile
very
loud
crashing
noise
was
coming
from
the
other
side
the
house
The
source
the
commotion
was
revealed
they
entered
the
garden
and
saw
that
Bill
and
Charlie
both
had
their
wands
out
and
were
making
two
battered
old
tables
fly
high
above
the
lawn
smashing
into
each
other
each
attempting
knock
the
other
out
the
air
Fred
and
George
were
cheering
Ginny
was
laughing
and
Hermione
was
hovering
near
the
hedge
apparently
torn
between
amusement
and
anxiety
Bill
table
caught
Charlie
with
huge
bang
and
knocked
one
its
legs
off
There
was
clatter
from
overhead
and
they
all
looked
see
Percy
head
poking
out
window
the
second
floor
Will

down
bellowed
Sorry
Perce
said
Bill
grinning
How
the
cauldron
bottoms
coming
Very
badly
said
Percy
peevishly
and
slammed
the
window
shut
Chuckling
Bill
and
Charlie
directed
the
tables
safely
onto
the
grass
end
end
and
then
with
flick
his
wand
Bill
reattached
the
table
leg
and
conjured
tablecloths
from
nowhere
seven
clock
the
two
tables
were
groaning
under
dishes
and
dishes
Mrs
Weasley

cooking
and
the
nine
Weasleys
Harry
and
Hermione

settling
themselves
down

the
far

Percy
was
telling
his
father
all
about
his
report
cauldron
bottoms
told
Crouch
that
have
ready
Tuesday
Percy
was
saying
pompously
That
bit
sooner
than
expected
but
like
keep
top
things
think
grateful
done
good
time
mean
its
extremely
busy
our
department

now
what
with
all
the
arrangements
for
the
World
Cup
just
not
getting
the
support
need
from
the
Department
Magical
Games
and
Sports
Ludo
Bagman
like
Ludo
said
Weasley
mildly
was
the
one
who
got
such
good
tickets
for
the
Cup
did
him
bit
favor
His
brother
Otto
got
into
spot
trouble
lawnmower
with
unnatural
powers
smoothed
the
whole
thing
over
Bagman
likable
enough
course
said
Percy
dismissively
but
how
ever
got
Head
Department
when
compare
him
Crouch
can
see
Crouch
losing
member
our
department
and
not
trying
find
out
what
happened
them
You
realize
Bertha
Jorkins
has
been
missing
for
over
month
now
Went
holiday
Albania
and
never
came
back
Yes
was
asking
Ludo
about
that
said
Weasley
frowning
says
Bertha
gotten
lost
plenty
times
before
now
though
must
say
was
someone
department
worried
Bertha
hopeless
all
right
said
Percy
hear
she
been
shunted
from
department
department
for
years
much
more
trouble
than
she
worth
but
all
the
same
Bagman
ought
trying
find
her
Crouch
has
been
taking
personal
interest
she
worked
our
department
one
time
you
know
and
think
Crouch
was
quite
fond
her
but
Bagman
just
keeps
laughing
and
saying
she
probably
misread
the
map
and
ended
Australia
instead
Albania
However
Percy
heaved
impressive
sigh
and
took
deep
swig
elderflower
wine
got
quite
enough
our
plates
the
Department
International
Magical
Cooperation
without
trying
find
members
other
departments
too
you
know
got
another
big
event
organize
right
after
the
World
Cup
Percy
cleared
his
throat
significantly
and
looked
down
toward
the
end
the
table
where
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
sitting
You
know
the
one
talking
about
Father
raised
his
voice
slightly
The
top
secret
one
Ron
rolled
his
eyes
and
muttered
Harry
and
Hermione
been
trying
get
ask
what
that
event
ever
since
started
work
Probably
exhibition
thick
bottomed
cauldrons
the
middle
the
table
Mrs
Weasley
was
arguing
with
Bill
about
his
earring
which
seemed
recent
acquisition
with
horrible
great
fang
Really
Bill
what
they
say
the
bank
Mum
one
the
bank
gives
damn
how
dress
long
bring
home
plenty
treasure
said
Bill
patiently
And
your
hair
getting
silly
dear
said
Mrs
Weasley
fingering
her
wand
lovingly
wish
you
let
give
trim
like
said
Ginny
who
was
sitting
beside
Bill
You
old
fashioned
Mum
Anyway
nowhere
near
long
Professor
Dumbledore
Next
Mrs
Weasley
Fred
George
and
Charlie
were
all
talking
spiritedly
about
the
World
Cup
got
Ireland
said
Charlie
thickly
through
mouthful
potato
They
flattened
Peru
the
semifinals
Bulgaria
has
got
Viktor
Krum
though
said
Fred
Krum
one
decent
player
Ireland
has
got
seven
said
Charlie
shortly
wish
England
had
got
through
That
was
embarrassing
that
was
What
happened
said
Harry
eagerly
regretting
more
than
ever
his
isolation
from
the
wizarding
world
when
was
stuck
Privet
Drive
Went
down
Transylvania
three
hundred
and
ninety
ten
said
Charlie
gloomily
Shocking
performance
And
Wales
lost
Uganda
and
Scotland
was
slaughtered
Luxembourg
Harry
had
been
the
Gryffindor
House
Quidditch
team
ever
since
his
first
year
Hogwarts
and
owned
one
the
best
racing
brooms
the
world
Firebolt
Flying
came
more
naturally
Harry
than
anything
else
the
magical
world
and
played
the
position
Seeker
the
Gryffindor
House
team
Weasley
conjured
candles
light
the
darkening
garden
before
they
had
their
homemade
strawberry
ice
cream
and
the
time
they
had
finished
moths
were
fluttering
low
over
the
table
and
the
warm
air
was
perfumed
with
the
smells
grass
and
honeysuckle
Harry
was
feeling
extremely
well
fed
and
peace
with
the
world
watched
several
gnomes
sprinting
through
the
rosebushes
laughing
madly
and
closely
pursued
Crookshanks
Ron
looked
carefully
the
table
check
that
the
rest
the
family
were
all
busy
talking
then
said
very
quietly
Harry
have
you
heard
from
Sirius
lately
Hermione
looked
around
listening
closely
Yeah
said
Harry
softly
twice
sounds
okay
wrote
him
yesterday
might
write
back
while
here
suddenly
remembered
the
reason
had
written
Sirius
and
for
moment
was
the
verge
telling
Ron
and
Hermione
about
his
scar
hurting
again
and
about
the
dream
that
had
awoken
him
but
really
didn
want
worry
them
just
now
not
when
himself
was
feeling
happy
and
peaceful
Look
the
time
Mrs
Weasley
said
suddenly
checking
her
wristwatch
You
really
should
bed
the
whole
lot
you

crack
dawn

the
Cup
Harry

Wow

said
Harry
enthusiastically
Well

Percy
sanctimoniously
shudder
think
what
the
state

from
work
for
five
days
Yeah

Perce
said
Fred
That
was
sample
fertilizer
from
Norway
said
Percy
going
very
red
the
face
was
nothing
personal

Fred
whispered
Harry

CHAPTER
SIX
THE
PORTKEY
Harry
felt
though
had
barely
lain
down
steep
Ron
room
when
was
being
shaken
awake
Mrs
Weasley
Time
Harry
dear
she
whispered
moving
away
wake
Ron
Harry
felt
around
for
his
glasses
put
them
and
sat
was
still
dark
outside
Ron
muttered
indistinctly
his
mother
roused
him
the
foot
Harry
mattress
saw
two
large
disheveled
shapes
emerging
from
tangles
blankets
time
already
said
Fred
groggily
They
dressed
silence
too
sleepy
talk
then
yawning
and
stretching
the
four
them
headed
downstairs
into
the
kitchen
Mrs
Weasley
was
stirring
the
contents
large
pot
the
stove
while
Weasley
was
sitting
the
table
checking
sheaf
large
parchment
tickets
looked
the
boys
entered
and
spread
his
arms
that
they
could
see
his
clothes
more
clearly
was
wearing
what
appeared
golfing
sweater
and
very
old
pair
jeans
slightly
too
big
for
him
and
held
with
thick
leather
belt
What
you
think
asked
anxiously
supposed
incognito
look
like
Muggle
Harry
Yeah
said
Harry
smiling
very
good
Where
Bill
and
Charlie
and
Per
Per
Percy
said
George
failing
stifle
huge
yawn
Well
they
Apparating
aren
they
said
Mrs
Weasley
heaving
the
large
pot
over
the
table
and
starting
ladle
porridge
into
bowls
they
can
have
bit
lie
Harry
knew
that
Apparating
meant
disappearing
from
one
place
and
reappearing
almost
instantly
another
but
had
never
known
any
Hogwarts
student
and
understood
that
was
very
difficult
they
still
bed
said
Fred
grumpily
pulling
his
bowl
porridge
toward
him
Why
can
Apparate
too
Because
you
not
age
and
you
haven
passed
your
test
snapped
Mrs
Weasley
And
where
have
those
girls
got
She
bustled
out
the
kitchen
and
they
heard
her
climbing
the
stairs
You
have
pass
test
Apparate
Harry
asked
yes
said
Weasley
tucking
the
tickets
safely
into
the
back
pocket
his
jeans
The
Department
Magical
Transportation
had
fine
couple
people
the
other
day
for
Apparating
without
license
not
easy
Apparition
and
when
not
done
property
can
lead
nasty
complications
This
pair
talking
about
went
and
splinched
themselves
Everyone
around
the
table
except
Harry
winced
splinched
said
Harry
They
left
half
themselves
behind
said
Weasley
now
spooning
large
amounts
treacle
onto
his
porridge
course
they
were
stuck
Couldn
move
either
way
Had
wait
for
the
Accidental
Magic
Reversal
Squad
sort
them
out
Meant
fair
old
bit
paperwork
can
tell
you
what
with
the
Muggles
who
spotted
the
body
parts
they
left
behind
Harry
had
sudden
vision
pair
legs
and
eyeball
lying
abandoned
the
pavement
Privet
Drive
Were
they
okay
asked
startled
yes
said
Weasley
matter
factly
But
they
got
heavy
fine
and
don
think
they
trying
again
hurry
You
don
mess
around
with
Apparition
There
are
plenty
adult
wizards
who
don
bother
with
Prefer
brooms
slower
but
safer
But
Bill
and
Charlie
and
Percy
can
all
Charlie
had
take
the
test
twice
said
Fred
grinning
failed
the
first
time
Apparated
five
miles
south
where
meant
right
top
some
poor
old
dear
doing
her
shopping
remember
Yes
well
passed
the
second
time
said
Mrs
Weasley
marching
back
into
the
kitchen
amid
hearty
sniggers
Percy
only
passed
two
weeks
ago
said
George
been
Apparating
downstairs
every
morning
since
just
prove
can
There
were
footsteps
down
the
passageway
and
Hermione
and
Ginny
came
into
the
kitchen
both
looking
pale
and
drowsy
Why
have
early
Ginny
said
rubbing
her
eyes
and
sitting
down
the
table
got
bit
walk
said
Weasley
Walk
said
Harry
What
are
walking
the
World
Cup
that
miles
away
said
Weasley
smiling
only
need
walk
short
way
just
that
very
difficult
for
large
number
wizards
congregate
without
attracting
Muggle
attention
have
very
careful
about
how
travel
the
best
times
and
huge
occasion
like
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
George
said
Mrs
Weasley
sharply
and
they
all
jumped
What
said
George
innocent
tone
that
deceived
nobody
What
that
your
pocket
Nothing
Don
you
lie
Mrs
Weasley
pointed
her
wand
George
pocket
and
said
Accio
Several
small
brightly
colored
objects
zoomed
out
George
pocket
made
grab
for
them
but
missed
and
they
sped
right
into
Mrs
Weasley
outstretched
hand
told
you
destroy
them
said
Mrs
Weasley
furiously
holding
what
were
unmistakably
more
Ton
Tongue
Toffees
told
you
get
rid
the
lot
Empty
your
pockets
both
you
was
unpleasant
scene
the
twins
had
evidently
been
trying
smuggle
many
toffees
out
the
house
possible
and
was
only
using
her
Summoning
Charm
that
Mrs
Weasley
managed
find
them
all
Accio
Accio
Accio
she
shouted
and
toffees
zoomed
from
all
sorts
unlikely
places
including
the
lining
George
jacket
and
the
turn
ups
Fred
jeans
spent
six
months
developing
those
Fred
shouted
his
mother
she
threw
the
toffees
away
fine
way
spend
six
months
she
shrieked
wonder
you
didn
get
more
All
all
the
atmosphere
was
not
very
friendly
they
took
their
departure
Mrs
Weasley
was
still
glowering
she
kissed
Weasley
the
cheek
though
not
nearly
much
the
twins
who
had
each
hoisted
their
rucksacks
onto
their
backs
and
walked
out
without
word
her
Well
have
lovely
time
said
Mrs
Weasley
and
behave
yourselves
she
called
after
the
twins
retreating
backs
but
they
did
not
look
back
answer
send
Bill
Charlie
and
Percy
along
around
midday
Mrs
Weasley
said
Weasley
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
set
off
across
the
dark
yard
after
Fred
and
George
was
chilly
and
the
moon
was
still
out
Only
dull
greenish
tinge
along
the
horizon
their
right
showed
that
daybreak
was
drawing
closer
Harry
having
been
thinking
about
thousands
wizards
speeding
toward
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
sped
walk
with
Weasley
how
does
everyone
get
there
without
all
the
Muggles
noticing
asked
been
massive
organizational
problem
sighed
Weasley
The
trouble
about
hundred
thousand
wizards
turn
the
World
Cup
and
course
just
haven
got
magical
site
big
enough
accommodate
them
all
There
are
places
Muggles
can
penetrate
but
imagine
trying
pack
hundred
thousand
wizards
into
Diagon
Alley
platform
nine
and
three
quarters
had
find
nice
deserted
moor
and
set
many
anti
Muggle
precautions
possible
The
whole
Ministry
been
working
for
months
First
course
have
stagger
the
arrivals
People
with
cheaper
tickets
have
arrive
two
weeks
beforehand
limited
number
use
Muggle
transport
but
can
have
too
many
clogging
their
buses
and
trains
remember
wizards
are
coming
from
all
over
the
world
Some
Apparate
course
but
have
set
safe
points
for
them
appear
well
away
from
Muggles
believe
there
handy
wood
they
using
the
Apparition
point
For
those
who
don
want
Apparate
can
use
Portkeys
They
objects
that
are
used
transport
wizards
from
one
spot
another
prearranged
time
You
can
large
groups
time
you
need
There
have
been
two
hundred
Portkeys
placed
strategic
points
around
Britain
and
the
nearest
one
the
top
Stoatshead
Hill
that
where
headed
Weasley
pointed
ahead
them
where
large
black
mass
rose
beyond
the
village
Ottery
Catchpole
What
sort
objects
are
Portkeys
said
Harry
curiously
Well
they
can
anything
said
Weasley
Unobtrusive
things
obviously
Muggles
don
picking
them
and
playing
with
them
stuff
they
just
think
litter
They
trudged
down
the
dark
dank
lane
toward
the
village
the
silence
broken
only
their
footsteps
The
sky
lightened
very
slowly
they
made
their
way
through
the
village
its
inky
blackness
diluting
deepest
blue
Harry
hands
and
feet
were
freezing
Weasley
kept
checking
his
watch
They
didn
have
breath
spare
for
talking
they
began
climb
Stoatshead
Hill
stumbling
occasionally
hidden
rabbit
holes
slipping
thick
black
tuffets
grass
Each
breath
Harry
took
was
sharp
his
chest
and
his
legs
were
starting
seize
when
last
his
feet
found
level
ground
Whew
panted
Weasley
taking
off
his
glasses
and
wiping
them
his
sweater
Well
made
good
time
got
ten
minutes
Hermione
came
over
the
crest
the
hill
last
clutching
stitch
her
side
Now
just
need
the
Portkey
said
Weasley
replacing
his
glasses
and
squinting
around
the
ground
won
big
Come
They
spread
out
searching
They
had
only
been
for
couple
minutes
however
when
shout
rent
the
still
air
Over
here
Arthur
Over

Two
tall
figures

silhouetted
against
the
starry
sky

the
hilltop
Amos
said
Weasley
smiling
strode
over
the
man
who
had
shouted
The
rest
them
followed
Weasley
was
shaking
hands
with
ruddy

wizard
with
scrubby
brown

who
was

merely
nodded
They

Cedric
for

Long

around
the
three

Ginny

when
they
met
him
used
the
way
their
eyes
moved
once
the
lightning
scar
his
forehead
but
always
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
Ced

Amos
Diggory

Ced
that

You

Harry
Potter
Harry
couldn
think
any
reply
this
remained
silent
Fred
and
George
were
both
scowling
again
Cedric
looked
slightly
embarrassed
Harry
fell
off
his
broom
Dad
muttered
told
you

Yes

Amos
genially

With
difficulty
owing

bulky
backpacks
the
nine

crowded
around
the

boot
held
out
Amos
Diggory
They
all
stood
there
tight
circle
chill

over
the
hilltop
Nobody

Harry

still
his
watch
two
one
happened
immediately
Harry
felt
though
hook
just
behind
his
navel
had
been
suddenly
jerked
irresistibly
forward
His
feet
left
the
ground
could
feel
Ron
and
Hermione
either
side
him
their
shoulders
banging
into
his
they
were
all
speeding
forward
howl
wind
and
swirling
color
his
forefinger
was
stuck
the
boot
though
was
pulling
him
magnetically
onward
and
then
His
feet
slammed
into
the
ground
Ron
staggered
into
him
and
fell
over
the
Portkey
hit
the
ground
near
his
head
with
heavy
thud
Harry
looked
Weasley
Diggory
and
Cedric
were
still
standing
though
looking
very
windswept
everybody
else
was
the
ground
Seven
past

CHAPTER
SEVEN
BAGMAN
AND
CROUCH
Harry
disentangled
himself
from
Ron
and
got
his
feet
They
had
arrived
what
appeared
deserted
stretch
misty
moor
front
them
was
pair
tired
and
grumpy
looking
wizards
one
whom
was
holding
large
gold
watch
the
other
thick
roll
parchment
and
quill
Both
were
dressed
Muggles
though
very
inexpertly
The
man
with
the
watch
wore
tweed
suit
with
thigh
length
galoshes
his
colleague
kilt
and
poncho
Morning
Basil
said
Weasley
picking
the
boot
and
handing
the
kilted
wizard
who
threw
into
large
box
used
Portkeys
beside
him
Harry
could
see
old
newspaper
empty
drinks
can
and
punctured
football
Hello

Arthur
said
Basil
wearily
Not
duty
all
right
for
some
been

all

You

way

big
party
coming
from

Weasley
consulted
his
parchment
list
About

mile

Site

Diggory
second
field

Thanks
Basil
said
Weasley
and
beckoned
everyone
follow
him
They
set
off
across
the
deserted
moor
unable
make
out
much
through
the
mist
After
about
twenty
minutes
small
stone
cottage
next
gate
swam
into
view
Beyond
Harry
could
just
make
out
the
ghostly
shapes
hundreds
and
hundreds
tents
rising
the
gentle
slope
large
field
toward
dark
wood
the
horizon
They
said
good
bye
the
Diggorys
and
approached
the
cottage
door
man
was
standing
the
doorway
looking
out
the
tents
Harry
knew
glance
that
this
was
the
only
real
Muggle
for
several
acres
When
heard
their
footsteps
turned
his
head
look
them
Morning
said
Weasley
brightly
Morning
said
the
Muggle
Would

Roberts
Aye
would
said
Roberts
And
who

Weasley
two
tents
booked
couple
days
ago
Aye
said
Roberts
consulting
list
tacked
the
door
You

space
the
wood
there
Just
the
one
night
That
said
Weasley
You
paying
now
then
said
Roberts
right
certainly
said
Weasley
retreated
short
distance
from
the
cottage
and
beckoned
Harry
toward
him
Help
Harry
muttered
pulling
roll
Muggle
money
from
his
pocket
and
starting
peel
the
notes
apart
This
one
ten
yes
see
the
little
number

Harry
corrected
him
undertone
uncomfortably
aware
Roberts
trying
catch
every
word
yes

know
these
little
bits
paper
You
foreign
said
Roberts
Weasley
returned
with
the
correct
notes
Foreign
repeated
Weasley
puzzled
You
not
the
first
one
who
had
trouble
with
money
said
Roberts
scrutinizing
Weasley
closely
had
two
try
and
pay
with
great
gold
coins
the
size
hubcaps
ten
minutes
ago
Did
you
really
said
Weasley
nervously
Roberts
rummaged
around
tin
for
some
change
Never
been
this
crowded
said
suddenly
looking
out
over
the
misty
field
again
Hundreds
pre
bookings
People
usually
just
turn
that
right
said
Weasley
his
hand
held
out
for
his
change
but
Roberts
didn
give
him
Aye
said
thoughtfully
People
from
all
over
Loads
foreigners
And
not
just
foreigners
Weirdos
you
know
There
bloke
walking
round
kilt
and
poncho
Shouldn
said
Weasley
anxiously
like
some
sort
dunno
like
some
sort
rally
said
Roberts
They
all
seem
know
each
other
Like
big
party
that
moment
wizard
plus
fours
appeared
out
thin
air
next
Roberts
front
door
Obliviate
said
sharply
pointing
his
wand
Roberts
Instantly
Roberts
eyes
slid
out
focus
his
brows
unknitted
and
took
dreamy
unconcern
fell
over
his
face
Harry
recognized
the
symptoms
one
who
had
just
had
his
memory
modified
map
the
campsite
for
you
Roberts
said
placidly
Weasley
And
your
change
Thanks
very
much
said
Weasley
The
wizard
plus
fours
accompanied
them
toward
the
gate
the
campsite
looked
exhausted
His
chin
was
blue
with
stubble
and
there
were
deep
purple
shadows
under
his
eyes
Once
out
earshot
Roberts
muttered
Weasley
Been
having
lot
trouble
with
him
Needs
Memory
Charm
ten
times
day
keep
him
happy
And
Ludo
Bagman
not
helping
Trotting
around
talking
about
Bludgers
and
Quaffles
the
top
his
voice
not
worry
about
anti
Muggle
security
Blimey
glad
when
this
over
See
you
later
Arthur
Disapparated
thought
Bagman
was
Head
Magical
Games
and
Sports
said
Ginny
looking
surprised
should
know
better
than
talk
about
Bludgers
near
Muggles
shouldn
should
said
Weasley
smiling
and
leading
them
through
the
gates
into
the
campsite
but
Ludo
always
been
bit
well
lax
about
security
You
couldn
wish
for
more
enthusiastic
head
the
sports
department
though
played
Quidditch
for
England
himself
you
know
And
was
the
best
Beater
the
Wimbourne
Wasps
ever
had
They
trudged
the
misty
field
between
long
rows
tents
Most
looked
almost
ordinary
their
owners
had
clearly
tried
make
them
Muggle
like
possible
but
had
slipped
adding
chimneys
bellpulls
weather
vanes
However
here
and
there
was
tent
obviously
magical
that
Harry
could
hardly
surprised
that
Roberts
was
getting
suspicious
Halfway
the
field
stood
extravagant
confection
striped
silk
like
miniature
palace
with
several
live
peacocks
tethered
the
entrance
little
farther
they
passed
tent
that
had
three
floors
and
several
turrets
and
short
way
beyond
that
was
tent
that
had
front
garden
attached
complete
with
birdbath
sundial
and
fountain
Always
the
same
said
Weasley
smiling
can
resist
showing
off
when
get
together
here
are
look
this
They
had
reached
the
very
edge
the
wood
the
top
the
field
and
here
was
empty
space
with
small
sign
hammered
into
the
ground
that
read
WEEZLY
Couldn
have
better
spot
said
Weasley
happily
The
field
just
the
other
side
the
wood
there
close
could
hoisted
his
backpack
from
his
shoulders
Right
said
excitedly
magic
allowed
strictly
speaking
not
when
out
these
numbers
Muggle
land
putting
these
tents
hand
Shouldn
too
difficult
Muggles
all
the
time
Here
Harry
where
you
reckon
should
start
Harry
had
never
been
camping
his
life
the
Dursleys
had
never
taken
him
any
kind
holiday
preferring
leave
him
with
Mrs
Figg
old
neighbor
However
and
Hermione
worked
out
where
most
the
poles
and
pegs
should
and
though
Weasley
was
more
hindrance
than
help
because
got
thoroughly
overexcited
when
came
using
the
mallet
they
finally
managed
erect
pair
shabby
two
man
tents
All
them
stood
back
admire
their
handiwork
Nobody
looking
these
tents
would
guess
they
belonged
wizards
Harry
thought
but
the
trouble
was
that
once
Bill
Charlie
and
Percy
arrived
they
would
party
ten
Hermione
seemed
have
spotted
this
problem
too
she
gave
Harry
quizzical
look
Weasley
dropped
his
hands
and
knees
and
entered
the
first
tent
bit
cramped
called
but
think
all
squeeze
Come
and
have
look
Harry
bent
down
ducked
under
the
tent
flap
and
felt
his
jaw
drop
had
walked
into
what
looked
like
old
fashioned
three
room
flat
complete
with
bathroom
and
kitchen
Oddly
enough
was
furnished
exactly
the
same
sort
style
Mrs
Figg
house
There
were
crocheted
covers
the
mismatched
chairs
and
strong
smell
cats
Well
not
for
long
said
Weasley
mopping
his
bald
patch
with
handkerchief
and
peering
the
four
bunk
beds
that
stood
the
bedroom
borrowed
this
from
Perkins
the
office
Doesn
camp
much
anymore
poor
fellow
got
lumbago
picked
the
dusty
kettle
and
peered
inside
need
water
There
tap
marked
this
map
the
Muggle
gave
said
Ron
who
had
followed
Harry
inside
the
tent
and
seemed
completely
unimpressed
its
extraordinary
inner
proportions
the
other
side
the
field
Well
why
don
you
Harry
and
Hermione
and
get
some
water
then
Weasley
handed
over
the
kettle
and
couple
saucepans
and
the
rest
will
get
some
wood
for
fire
But
got
oven
said
Ron
Why
can
just
Ron
anti
Muggle
security
said
Weasley
his
face
shining
with
anticipation
When
real
Muggles
camp
they
cook
fires
outdoors
seen
them
After
quick
tour
the
girls
tent
which
was
slightly
smaller
than
the
boys
though
without
the
smell
cats
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
set
off
across
the
campsite
with
the
kettle
and
saucepans
Now
with
the
sun
newly
risen
and
the
mist
lifting
they
could
see
the
city
tents
that
stretched
every
direction
They
made
their
way
slowly
through
the
rows
staring
eagerly
around
was
only
just
dawning
Harry
how
many
witches
and
wizards
there
must
the
world
had
never
really
thought
much
about
those
other
countries
Their
fellow
campers
were
starting
wake
First
stir
were
the
families
with
small
children
Harry
had
never
seen
witches
and
wizards
this
young
before
tiny
boy
older
than
two
was
crouched
outside
large
pyramid
shaped
tent
holding
wand
and
poking
happily
slug
the
grass
which
was
swelling
slowly
the
size
salami
they
drew
level
with
him
his
mother
came
hurrying
out
the
tent
How
many
times
Kevin
You
don
touch
Daddy
wand
yecchh
She
had
trodden
the
giant
slug
which
burst
Her
scolding
carried
after
them
the
still
air
mingling
with
the
little
boy
yells
You
bust
slug
You
bust
slug
short
way
farther
they
saw
two
little
witches
barely
older
than
Kevin
who
were
riding
toy
broomsticks
that
rose
only
high
enough
for
the
girls
toes
skim
the
dewy
grass
Ministry
wizard
had
already
spotted
them
hurried
past
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
muttered
distractedly
broad
daylight
Parents
having
lie
suppose
Here
and
there
adult
wizards
and
witches
were
emerging
from
their
tents
and
starting
cook
breakfast
Some
with
furtive
looks
around
them
conjured
fires
with
their
wands
others
were
striking
matches
with
dubious
looks
their
faces
though
sure
this
couldn
work
Three
African
wizards
sat
serious
conversation
all
them
wearing
long
white
robes
and
roasting
what
looked
like
rabbit
bright
purple
fire
while
group
middle
aged
American
witches
sat
gossiping
happily
beneath
spangled
banner
stretched
between
their
tents
that
read
THE
SALEM
WITCHES
INSTITUTE
Harry
caught
snatches
conversation
strange
languages
from
the
inside
tents
they
passed
and
though
couldn
understand
word
the
tone
every
single
voice
was
excited
eyes
has
everything
gone
green
said
Ron
wasn
just
Ron
eyes
They
had
walked
into
patch
tents
that
were
all
covered
with
thick
growth
shamrocks
that
looked
though
small
oddly
shaped
hillocks
had
sprouted
out
the
earth
Grinning
faces
could
seen
under
those
that
had
their
flaps
open
Then
from
behind
them
they
heard
their
names
Harry
Ron
Hermione
was
Seamus
Finnigan
their
fellow
Gryffindor
fourth
year
was
sitting
front
his
own
shamrock
covered
tent
with
sandy
haired
woman
who
had
his
mother
and
his
best
friend
Dean
Thomas
also
Gryffindor
Like
the
decorations
said
Seamus
grinning
The
Ministry
not
too
happy
why
shouldn
show
our
colors
said
Mrs
Finnigan
You
should
see
what
the
Bulgarians
have
got
dangling
all
over
their
tents
You
supporting
Ireland
course
she
added
eyeing
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
beadily
When
they
had
assured
her
that
they
were
indeed
supporting
Ireland
they
set
off
again
though
Ron
said
Like
say
anything
else
surrounded
that
lot
wonder
what
the
Bulgarians
have
got
dangling
all
over
their
tents
said
Hermione
Let
and
have
look
said
Harry
pointing
large
patch
tents
upfield
where
the
Bulgarian
flag
white
green
and
red
was
fluttering
the
breeze
The
tents
here
had
not
been
bedecked
with
plant
life
but
each
and
every
one
them
had
the
same
poster
attached
poster
very
surly
face
with
heavy
black
eyebrows
The
picture
was
course
moving
but
all
did
was
blink
and
scowl
Krum
said
Ron
quietly
What
said
Hermione
Krum
said
Ron
Viktor
Krum
the
Bulgarian
Seeker
looks
really
grumpy
said
Hermione
looking
around
the
many
Krums
blinking
and
scowling
them
Really
grumpy
Ron
raised
his
eyes
the
heavens
Who
cares
what
looks
like
unbelievable
really
young
too
Only
just
eighteen
something
genius
you
wait
until
tonight
you
see
There
was
already
small
queue
for
the
tap
the
corner
the
field
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
joined
right
behind
pair
men
who
were
having
heated
argument
One
them
was
very
old
wizard
who
was
wearing
long
flowery
nightgown
The
other
was
clearly
Ministry
wizard
was
holding
out
pair
pinstriped
trousers
and
almost
crying
with
exasperation
Just
put
them
Archie
there
good
chap
You
can
walk
around
like
that
the
Muggle
the
gate
already
getting
suspicious
bought
this
Muggle
shop
said
the
old
wizard
stubbornly
Muggles
wear
them
Muggle
women
wear
them
Archie
not
the
men
they
wear
these
said
the
Ministry
wizard
and
brandished
the
pinstriped
trousers
not
putting
them
said
old
Archie
indignation
like
healthy
breeze
round
privates
thanks
Hermione
was
overcome
with
such
strong
fit
the
giggles
this
point
that
she
had
duck
out
the
queue
and
only
returned
when
Archie
had
collected
his
water
and
moved
away
Walking
more
slowly
now
because
the
weight
the
water
they
made
their
way
back
through
the
campsite
Here
and
there
they
saw
more
familiar
faces
other
Hogwarts
students
with
their
families
Oliver
Wood
the
old
captain
Harry
House
Quidditch
team
who
had
just
left
Hogwarts
dragged
Harry
over
his
parents
tent
introduce
him
and
told
him
excitedly
that
had
just
been
signed
the
Puddlemere
United
reserve
team
Next
they
were
hailed
Ernie
Macmillan
Hufflepuff
fourth
year
and
little
farther
they
saw
Cho
Chang
very
pretty
girl
who
played
Seeker
the
Ravenclaw
team
She
waved
and
smiled
Harry
who
slopped
quite
lot
water
down
his
front
waved
back
More
stop
Ron
from
smirking
than
anything
Harry
hurriedly
pointed
out
large
group
teenagers
whom
had
never
seen
before
Who
you
reckon
they
are
said
They
don
Hogwarts
they
Spect
they
some
foreign
school
said
Ron
know
there
are
others
Never
met
anyone
who
went
one
though
Bill
had
penfriend
school
Brazil
this
was
years
and
years
ago
and
wanted
exchange
trip
but
Mum
and
Dad
couldn
afford
His
penfriend
got
all
offended
when
said
wasn
going
and
sent
him
cursed
hat
made
his
ears
shrivel
Harry
laughed
but
didn
voice
the
amazement
felt
hearing
about
other
wizarding
schools
supposed
now
that
saw
representatives
many
nationalities
the
campsite
that
had
been
stupid
never
realize
that
Hogwarts
couldn
the
only
one
glanced
Hermione
who
looked
utterly
unsurprised
the
information
doubt
she
had
run
across
the
news
about
other
wizarding
schools
some
book
other
You
been
ages
said
George
when
they
finally
got
back
the
Weasleys
tents
Met
few
people
said
Ron
setting
the
water
down
You
not
got
that
fire
started
yet
Dad
having
fun
with
the
matches
said
Fred
Weasley
was
having
success
all
lighting
the
fire
but
wasn
for
lack
trying
Splintered
matches
littered
the
ground
around
him
but
looked
though
was
having
the
time
his
life
Oops
said
managed
light
match
and
promptly
dropped
surprise
Come
here
Weasley
said
Hermione
kindly
taking
the
box
from
him
and
showing
him
how
properly
last
they
got
the
fire
lit
though
was
least
another
hour
before
was
hot
enough
cook
anything
There
was
plenty
watch
while
they
waited
however
Their
tent
seemed
pitched
right
alongside
kind
thoroughfare
the
field
and
Ministry
members
kept
hurrying
and
down
greeting
Weasley
cordially
they
passed
Weasley
kept
running
commentary
mainly
for
Harry
and
Hermione
benefit
his
own
children
knew
too
much
about
the
Ministry
greatly
interested
That
was
Cuthbert
Mockridge
Head

From

the
fire
was
ready
and
they
had
just
started
cooking
eggs
and
sausages
when
Bill
Charlie
and
Percy
came
strolling
out
the
woods
toward
them
Just
Apparated
Dad
said
Percy
loudly
excellent
lunch
They
were
halfway
through
their
plates
eggs
and
sausages
when
Weasley
jumped
his
feet
waving
and
grinning
man
who
was
striding
toward
them
Aha
said
The
man
the
moment
Ludo
Ludo
Bagman
was
easily
the
most
noticeable
person
Harry
had
seen
far
even
including
old
Archie
his
flowered
nightdress
was
wearing
long
Quidditch
robes
thick
horizontal
stripes
bright
yellow
and
black
enormous
picture
wasp
was
splashed
across
his
chest
had
the
look
powerfully
built
man
gone
slightly
seed
the
robes
were
stretched
tightly
across
large
belly
surely
had
not
had
the
days
when
had
played
Quidditch
for
England
His
nose
was
squashed
probably
broken
stray
Bludger
Harry
thought
but
his
round
blue
eyes
short
blond
hair
and
rosy
complexion
made
him
look
like
very
overgrown
schoolboy
Ahoy
there
Bagman
called
happily
was
walking
though
had
springs
attached
the
balls
his
feet
and
was
plainly
state
wild
excitement
Arthur
old
man
puffed
reached
the
campfire
what
day
What
day
Could
have
asked
for
more
perfect
weather
cloudless
night
coming
and
hardly
hiccough
the
arrangements
Not
much
for
Behind
him
group
haggard
looking
Ministry
wizards
rushed
past
pointing
the
distant
evidence
some
sort
magical
fire
that
was
sending
violet
sparks
twenty
feet
into
the
air
Percy
hurried
forward
with
his
hand
outstretched
Apparently
his
disapproval
the
way
Ludo
Bagman
ran
his
department
did
not
prevent
him
from
wanting
make
good
impression
yes
said
Weasley
grinning
this
son
Percy
just
started
the
Ministry
and
this
Fred
George
sorry
that
Fred
Bill
Charlie
Ron
daughter
Ginny
and
Ron
friends
Hermione
Granger
and
Harry
Potter
Bagman
did
the
smallest
double
takes
when
heard
Harry
name
and
his
eyes
performed
the
familiar
flick
upward
the
scar
Harry
forehead
Everyone
Weasley
continued
this
Ludo
Bagman
you
know
who
thanks
him
got
such
good
tickets
Bagman
beamed
and
waved
his
hand
say
had
been
nothing
Fancy
flutter
the
match
Arthur
said
eagerly
jingling
what
seemed
large
amount
gold
the
pockets
his
yellow
and
black
robes
already
got
Roddy
Pontner
betting
Bulgaria
will
score
first
offered
him
nice
odds
considering
Ireland
front
three
are
the
strongest
seen
years
and
little
Agatha
Timms
has
put

shares
her
eel
farm
weeklong
match
then
said
Weasley
Let
see
Galleon
Ireland
win
Galleon
Ludo
Bagman
looked
slightly
disappointed
but
recovered
himself
Very
well
very
well
any
other
takers
They
bit
young
gambling
said
Weasley
Molly
wouldn
like
bet
thirty
seven
Galleons
fifteen
Sickles
three
Knuts
said
Fred
and
George
quickly
pooled
all
their
money
that
Ireland
wins
but
Viktor
Krum
gets
the
Snitch
and
throw
fake
wand
You
don
want
showing
Bagman
rubbish
like
that
Percy
hissed
but
Bagman
didn
seem
think
the
wand
was
rubbish
all
the
contrary
his
boyish
face
shone
with
excitement
took
from
Fred
and
when
the
wand
gave
loud
squawk
and
turned
into
rubber
chicken
Bagman
roared
with
laughter
Excellent
haven
seen
one
that
convincing
years
pay
five
Galleons
for
that
Percy
froze
attitude
stunned
disapproval
Boys
said
Weasley
under
his
breath
don
want
you
betting
That
all

savings
Your
mother
Don
spoilsport
Arthur
boomed
Ludo
Bagman
rattling
his
pockets
excitedly
They
old
enough
know
what
they
want
You
reckon
Ireland
will
win
but
Krum
get
the
Snitch
Not
chance
boys
not
chance
give
you
excellent
odds
that
one
add
five
Galleons
for
the
funny
wand
then
shall
Weasley
looked
helplessly
Ludo
Bagman
whipped
out
notebook
and
quill
and
began
jotting
down
the
twins
names
Cheers
said
George
taking
the
slip
parchment
Bagman
handed
him
and
tucking
away
into
the
front
his
robes
Bagman
turned
most
cheerfully
back
Weasley
Couldn
brew
suppose
keeping
eye
out
for
Barty
Crouch
Bulgarian
opposite
number
making
difficulties
and
can
understand
word
saying
Barty
able
sort
out
speaks
about
hundred
and
fifty
languages
Crouch
said
Percy
suddenly
abandoning
his
look
poker
stiff
disapproval
and
positively
writhing
with
excitement
speaks
over
two
hundred
Mermish
and
Gobbledegook
and
Troll
Anyone
can
speak
Troll
said
Fred
dismissively
All
you
have
point
and
grunt
Percy
threw
Fred
extremely
nasty
look
and
stoked
the
fire
vigorously
bring
the
kettle
back
the
boil
Any
news
Bertha
Jorkins
yet
Ludo
Weasley
asked
Bagman
settled
himself
down
the
grass
beside
them
all
Not
dicky
bird
said
Bagman
comfortably
But
she
turn
Poor
old
Bertha
memory
like
leaky
cauldron
and
sense
direction
Lost
you
take
word
for
She
wander
back
into
the
office
sometime
October
thinking
still
July
You
don
think
might
time
send
someone
look
for
her
Weasley
suggested
tentatively
Percy
handed
Bagman
his
tea
Barty
Crouch
keeps
saying
that
said
Bagman
his
round
eyes
widening
innocently
but
really
can
spare
anyone
the
moment
talk
the
devil
Barty
wizard
had
just
Apparated
their
fireside
and
could
not
have
made
more
contrast
with
Ludo
Bagman
sprawled
the
grass
his
old
Wasp
robes
Barty
Crouch
was
stiff
upright
elderly
man
dressed
impeccably
crisp
suit
and
tie
The
parting
his
short
gray
hair
was
almost
unnaturally
straight
and
his
narrow
toothbrush
mustache
looked
though
trimmed
using
slide
rule
His
shoes
were
very
highly
polished
Harry
could
see
once
why
Percy
idolized
him
Percy
was
great
believer
rigidly
following
rules
and
Crouch
had
complied
with
the
rule
about
Muggle
dressing
thoroughly
that
could
have
passed
for
bank
manager
Harry
doubted
even
Uncle
Vernon
would
have
spotted
him
for
what
really
was
Pull
bit
grass
Barry
said
Ludo
brightly
patting
the
ground
beside
him
thank
you
Ludo
said
Crouch
and
there
was
bite
impatience
his
voice
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
The
Bulgarians
are
insisting
add
another
twelve
seats
the
Top
Box
that
what
they
after
said
Bagman
thought
the
chap
was
asking
borrow
pair
tweezers
Bit
strong
accent
Crouch
said
Percy
breathlessly
sunk
into
kind
halfbow
that
made
him
look
like
hunchback
Would
you
like
cup
tea
said
Crouch
looking
over
Percy
mild
surprise
Yes
thank
you
Weatherby
Fred
and
George
choked
into
their
own
cups
Percy
very
pink
around
the
ears
busied
himself
with
the
kettle
and
been
wanting
word
with
you
too
Arthur
said
Crouch
his
sharp
eyes
falling
upon
Weasley
Ali
Bashir
the
warpath
wants
word
with
you
about
your
embargo
flying
carpets
Weasley
heaved
deep
sigh
sent
him
owl
about

just
last
week
told
him
once
told
him
hundred
times
Carpets

said
Crouch
accepting

from
Percy
desperate
export
here
Well
they
never
replace

Britain

they
said
Bagman
Ali
thinks
there
niche
the
market
for

vehicle
said
Crouch
remember
grandfather
had
Axminster
that
could
seat
twelve
but
that
was
before
carpets
were
banned
course
spoke
though
wanted
leave
nobody
any
doubt
that
all
his
ancestors
had
abided
strictly
the
law
been
keeping
busy
Barty
said
Bagman
breezily
Fairly
said
Crouch
dryly
Organizing
Portkeys

Ludo

both
glad
when

said
Weasley
Ludo
Bagman
looked
shocked
Glad
Don
know
when

more

Still
not
though

forward
Barty
Plenty

Crouch
raised
his
eyebrows
Bagman
agreed
not
make
the
announcement
until
all
the

Bagman
waving
the
word
away
like

They

They

Ludo

Bulgarians

said
Crouch
sharply
cutting
Bagman
remarks
short
Thank
you
for
the
tea
Weatherby
pushed
his
undrunk
tea
back
Percy
and
waited
for
Ludo
rise
Bagman
struggled
his
feet
swigging
down
the
last
his
tea
the
gold
his
pockets
chinking
merrily
See
you
all
later
said
You
the
Top
Box
with
commentating
waved
Barty
Crouch
nodded
curtly
and
both
them
Disapparated
What
happening
Hogwarts
Dad
said
Fred
once
What
were
they
talking
about
You
find
out
soon
enough
said
Weasley
smiling
classified
information
until
such
time
the
Ministry
decides
release
said
Percy
stiffly
Crouch
was
quite
right
not
disclose
shut
Weatherby
said
Fred
sense
excitement
rose
like
palpable
cloud
over
the
campsite
the
afternoon
wore
dusk
the
still
summer
air
itself
seemed
quivering
with
anticipation
and
darkness
spread
like
curtain
over
the
thousands
waiting
wizards
the
last
vestiges
pretence
disappeared
the
Ministry
seemed
have
bowed
the
inevitable
and
stopped
fighting
the
signs
blatant
magic
now
breaking
out
everywhere
Salesmen
were
Apparating
every
few
feet
carrying
trays
and
pushing
carts
full
extraordinary
merchandise
There
were
luminous
rosettes
green
for
Ireland
red
for
Bulgaria
which
were
squealing
the
names
the
players
pointed
green
hats
bedecked
with
dancing
shamrocks
Bulgarian
scarves
adorned
with
lions
that
really
roared
flags
from
both
countries
that
played
their
national
anthems
they
were
waved
there
were
tiny
models
Firebolts
that
really
flew
and
collectible
figures
famous
players
which
strolled
across
the
palm
your
hand
preening
themselves
Been
saving
pocket
money
all
summer
for
this
Ron
told
Harry
they
and
Hermione
strolled
through
the
salesmen
buying
souvenirs
Though
Ron
purchased
dancing
shamrock
hat
and
large
green
rosette
also
bought
small
figure
Viktor
Krum
the
Bulgarian
Seeker
The
miniature
Krum
walked
backward
and
forward
over
Ron
hand
scowling
the
green
rosette
above
him
Wow
look
these
said
Harry
hurrying
over
cart
piled
high
with
what
looked
like
brass
binoculars
except
that
they
were
covered
with
all
sorts
weird
knobs
and
dials
Omnioculars
said
the
saleswizard
eagerly
You
can
replay

slow
everything
down
and
they
flash

Bargain
ten
Galleons
each
Wish

bought
this
now
said
Ron
gesturing
his
dancing
shamrock
hat
and
gazing
longingly
the
Omnioculars
Three
pairs
said
Harry
firmly
the
wizard
don
bother
said
Ron
going
red
was
always
touchy
about
the
fact
that
Harry
who
had
inherited
small
fortune
from
his
parents
had
much
more
money
than
did
You
won
getting
anything
for
Christmas
Harry
told
him
thrusting
Omnioculars
into
his
and
Hermione
hands
For
about
ten
years
mind
Fair
enough
said
Ron
grinning
Oooh
thanks
Harry
said
Hermione
And
get
some
programs
look
Their
money
bags
considerably
lighter
they
went
back
the
tents
Bill
Charlie
and
Ginny
were
all
sporting
green
rosettes
too
and
Weasley
was
carrying
Irish
flag
Fred
and
George
had
souvenirs
they
had
given
Bagman
all
their
gold
And
then
deep
booming
gong
sounded
somewhere
beyond
the
woods
and
once
green
and
red
lanterns
blazed
into
life
the
trees
lighting
path
the
field
time
said
Weasley
looking
excited
any
them
Come

CHAPTER
EIGHT
THE
QUIDDITCH
WORLD
CUP
Clutching
their
purchases
Weasley
the
lead
they
all
hurried
into
the
wood
following
the
lantern
lit
trail
They
could
hear
the
sounds
thousands
people
moving
around
them
shouts
and
laughter
snatches
singing
The
atmosphere
feverish
excitement
was
highly
infectious
Harry
couldn
stop
grinning
They
walked
through
the
wood
for
twenty
minutes
talking
and
joking
loudly
until
last
they
emerged
the
other
side
and
found
themselves
the
shadow
gigantic
stadium
Though
Harry
could
see
only
fraction
the
immense
gold
walls
surrounding
the
field
could
tell
that
ten
cathedrals
would
fit
comfortably
inside
Seats

Every

they
suddenly
remembered
urgent
appointments
and
had
dash
away
again
bless
them
added
fondly
leading
the
way
toward
the
nearest
entrance
which
was
already
surrounded
swarm
shouting
witches

wizards
Prime

said
the

the
entrance
when
she
checked
their
tickets
Top
Box
Straight
upstairs
Arthur
and
high
you
can
The
stairs
into
the
stadium
were
carpeted
rich
purple
They
clambered
upward
with
the
rest
the
crowd
which
slowly
filtered
away
through
doors
into
the
stands
their
left
and
right
Weasley
party
kept
climbing
and
last
they
reached
the
top
the
staircase
and
found
themselves
small
box
set
the
highest
point
the
stadium
and
situated
exactly
halfway
between
the
golden
goal
posts
About
twenty
purple
and
gilt
chairs
stood
two
rows
here
and
Harry
filing
into
the
front
seats
with
the
Weasleys
looked
down
upon
scene
the
likes
which
could
never
have
imagined
hundred
thousand
witches
and
wizards
were
taking
their
places
the
seats
which
rose
levels
around
the
long
oval
field
Everything
was
suffused
with
mysterious
golden
light
which
seemed
come
from
the
stadium
itself
The
field
looked
smooth
velvet
from
their
lofty
position
either
end
the
field
stood
three
goal
hoops
fifty
feet
high
right
opposite
them
almost
Harry
eye
level
was
gigantic
blackboard
Gold
writing
kept
dashing
across
though
invisible
giant
hand
were
scrawling
upon
the
blackboard
and
then
wiping
off
again
watching
Harry
saw
that
was
flashing
advertisements
across
the
field

Harry
tore
his
eyes
away
from
the
sign
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
see
who
else
was
sharing
the
box
with
them
far
was
empty
except
for
tiny
creature
sitting
the
second
from
last
seat
the
end
the
row
behind
them
The
creature
whose
legs
were
short
they
stuck
out
front
the
chair
was
wearing
tea
towel
draped
like
toga
and
had
its
face
hidden
its
hands
Yet
those
long
batlike
ears
were
oddly
familiar
Dobby
said
Harry
incredulously
The
tiny
creature
looked
and
stretched
its
fingers
revealing
enormous
brown
eyes
and
nose
the
exact
size
and
shape
large
tomato
wasn
Dobby
was
however
unmistakably
house
elf
Harry
friend
Dobby
had
been
Harry
had
set
Dobby
free
from
his
old
owners
the
Malfoy
family
Did
sir
just
call
Dobby
squeaked
the
elf
curiously
from
between
its
fingers
Its
voice
was
higher
even
than
Dobby
had
been
teeny
quivering
squeak
voice
and
Harry
suspected
though
was
very
hard
tell
with
house
elf
that
this
one
might
just
female
Ron
and
Hermione
spun
around
their
seats
look
Though
they
had
heard
lot
about
Dobby
from
Harry
they
had
never
actually
met
him
Even
Weasley
looked
around
interest
Sorry
Harry
told
the
elf
just
thought
you
were
someone
knew
But

Dobby

squeaked
the
elf
She
was
shielding
her
face
though
blinded

though
the
Top
Box
was
not
brightly
lit
name
Winky
sir
and
you

Her
dark
brown
eyes
widened
the
size
side
plates
they
rested
upon
Harry
scar
You

Harry
Potter
Yeah
said
Harry
But
Dobby
talks
you
all
the
time
sir
said
lowering
her
hands
very
slightly
and
looking
awestruck
How
said
Harry
How
freedom
suiting
him
sir
said
Winky
shaking
her
head
sir
meaning
disrespect
sir
but
not
sure
you
did
Dobby
favor
sir
when
you
setting
him
free
Why
said
Harry
taken
aback
What
wrong
with
him
Freedom
going
Dobby
head
sir
said
Winky
sadly
Ideas
above
his
station
sir
Can
get
another
position
sir
Why
not
said
Harry
Winky
lowered
her
voice
half
octave
and
whispered
wanting
paying
for
his
work
sir
Paying
said
Harry
blankly
Well
why
shouldn
paid
Winky
looked
quite
horrified
the
idea
and
closed
her
fingers
slightly
that
her
face
was
half
hidden
again
House
elves
not
paid
sir
she
said
muffled
squeak
says
Dobby
says
find
yourself
nice
family
and
settle
down
Dobby
getting
all
sorts
high
jinks
sir
what
unbecoming
house
elf
You
goes
racketing
around
like
this
Dobby
says
and
next
thing
hear
you
front
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
Magical
Creatures
like
some
common
goblin
Well
about
time

bit
fun
said
Harry
House
elves
not
supposed
have
fun
Harry
Potter
said
Winky
firmly
from
behind
her
hands
House
elves
does
what
they
told
not
liking
heights
all
Harry
Potter
she
glanced
toward
the
edge
the
box
and
gulped
but
master
sends
the
Top
Box
and
comes
sir
Why
sent
you
here
knows
you
don
like
heights
said
Harry
frowning
Master
master
wants
save
him
seat
Harry
Potter
very
busy
said
Winky
tilting
her
head
toward
the
empty
space
beside
her
Winky
wishing
she
back
master
tent
Harry
Potter
but
Winky
does
what
she
told
Winky
good
house
elf
She
gave
the
edge
the
box
another
frightened
look
and
hid
her
eyes
completely
again
Harry
turned
back
the
others
that
house
elf
Ron
muttered
Weird

said
Harry
fervently
Ron
pulled
out
his
Omnioculars
and
started
testing
them
staring
down
into
the
crowd

other
side
the
stadium

Hermione
meanwhile
was
skimming
eagerly
through
her
velvetcovered
tasseled
program

from
the

precede
the
match
she
read
aloud
that
always
worth
watching
said
Weasley
National
teams

their
native
land
you

put
bit

The
box
filled
gradually
around
them
over
the
next
half
hour
Weasley
kept
shaking
hands
with
people
who
were
obviously
very
important
wizards
Percy
jumped
his
feet
often
that
looked
though
were
trying
sit
hedgehog
When
Cornelius
Fudge
the
Minister
Magic
himself
arrived
Percy
bowed
low
that
his
glasses
fell
off
and
shattered
Highly
embarrassed
repaired
them
with
his
wand
and
thereafter
remained
his
seat
throwing
jealous
looks
Harry
whom
Cornelius
Fudge
had
greeted
like
old
friend
They
had
met
before
and
Fudge
shook
Harry
hand
fatherly
fashion
asked
how
was
and
introduced
him
the
wizards
either
side
him
Harry
Potter
you
know
told
the
Bulgarian
minister
loudly
who
was
wearing
splendid
robes
black
velvet
trimmed
with
gold
and
didn
seem
understand
word
English
Harry
Potter
come

you
know

You

The
Bulgarian
wizard
suddenly
spotted
Harry
scar
and
started
gabbling
loudly
and
excitedly
pointing
Knew

said
Fudge
wearily
Harry

Lucius
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
turned
quickly
Edging
along
the
second
row
three
still
empty
seats
right
behind
Weasley
were
none
other
than
Dobby
the
house
elf
former
owners
Lucius
Malfoy
his
son
Draco
and
woman
Harry
supposed
must
Draco
mother
Harry
and
Draco
Malfoy
had
been
enemies
ever
since
their
very
first
journey
Hogwarts
pale
boy
with
pointed
face
and
white
blond
hair
Draco
greatly
resembled
his
father
His
mother
was
blonde
too
tall
and
slim
she
would
have
been
nice
looking
she
hadn
been
wearing
look
that
suggested
there
was
nasty
smell
under
her
nose
Fudge
said
Malfoy
holding
out
his
hand
reached
the
Minister
Magic
How

And
let
see
who

you
know
Arthur
Weasley
daresay
was
tense
moment
Weasley
and
Malfoy
looked
each
other
and
Harry
vividly
recalled
the
last
time
they
had
come
face
face
had
been
Flourish
and
Blotts
bookshop
and
they
had
had
fight
Malfoy
cold
gray
eyes
swept
over
Weasley
and
then
and
down
the
row
Good

Arthur
said
softly
What
did
you
have
sell

seats
the
Top
Box
Surely

Fudge

generous

Maladies
and
Injuries

How
how
nice
said
Weasley
with
very
strained
smile
Malfoy
eyes
had
returned
Hermione
who
went
slightly
pink
but
stared
determinedly
back
him
Harry
knew
exactly
what
was
making
Malfoy
lip
curl
like
that
The
Malfoys
prided
themselves
being
purebloods
other
words
they
considered
anyone
Muggle
descent
like
Hermione
second
class
However
under
the
gaze
the
Minister
Magic
Malfoy
didn
dare
say
anything
nodded
sneeringly
Weasley
and
continued
down
the
line
his
seats
Draco
shot
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
one
contemptuous
look
then
settled
himself
between
his
mother
and
father
Slimy
gits
Ron
muttered
Harry
and
Hermione
turned
face
the
field
again
Next
moment
Ludo
Bagman
charged
into
the
box
Everyone
ready
said
his
round
face
gleaming
like
great
excited
Edam
Minister
ready
Ready
when
you
are
Ludo
said
Fudge
comfortably
Ludo
whipped
out
his
wand
directed
his
own
throat
and
said
Sonorus
and
then
spoke
over
the
roar
sound
that
was
now
filling
the
packed
stadium
his
voice
echoed
over
them
booming
into
every
corner
the
stands
Ladies
and
gentlemen
welcome
Welcome
the
final
the
four
hundred
and
twenty
second
Quidditch
World
Cup
The
spectators
screamed
and
clapped
Thousands
flags
waved
adding
their
discordant
national
anthems
the
racket
The
huge
blackboard
opposite
them
was
wiped
clear
its
last
message
Bertie
Bott
Every
Flavor
Beans
Risk
With
Every
Mouthful
and
now
showed
BULGARIA
IRELAND
And
now
without
further
ado
allow
introduce
the
Bulgarian
National
Team
Mascots
The
right
hand
side
the
stands
which
was
solid
block
scarlet
roared
its
approval
wonder
what
they
brought
said
Weasley
leaning
forward
his
seat
Aaah
suddenly
whipped
off
his
glasses
and
polished
them
hurriedly
his
robes
Veela
What
are
veel
But
hundred
veela
were
now
gliding
out
onto
the
field
and
Harry
question
was
answered
for
him
Veela
were
women
the
most
beautiful
women
Harry
had
ever
seen
except
that
they
weren
they
couldn
human
This
puzzled
Harry
for
moment
while
tried
guess
what
exactly
they
could
what
could
make
their
skin
shine
moon
bright
like
that
their
white
gold
hair
fan
out
behind
them
without
wind
but
then
the
music
started
and
Harry
stopped
worrying
about
them
not
being
human
fact
stopped
worrying
about
anything
all
The
veela
had
started
dance
and
Harry
mind
had
gone
completely
and
blissfully
blank
All
that
mattered
the
world
was
that
kept
watching
the
veela
because
they
stopped
dancing
terrible
things
would
happen
And
the
veela
danced
faster
and
faster
wild
half
formed
thoughts
started
chasing
through
Harry
dazed
mind
wanted
something
very
impressive
right
now
Jumping
from
the
box
into
the
stadium
seemed
good
idea
but
would
good
enough
Harry
what
are
you
doing
said
Hermione
voice
from
long
way
off
The
music
stopped
Harry
blinked
was
standing
and
one
his
legs
was
resting
the
wall
the
box
Next
him
Ron
was
frozen
attitude
that
looked
though
were
about
dive
from
springboard
Angry
yells
were
filling
the
stadium
The
crowd
didn
want
the
veela
Harry
was
with
them
would
course
supporting
Bulgaria
and
wondered
vaguely
why
had
large
green
shamrock
pinned
his
chest
Ron
meanwhile
was
absentmindedly
shredding
the
shamrocks
his
hat
Weasley
smiling
slightly
leaned
over
Ron
and
tugged
the
hat
out
his
hands
You
wanting
that
said
once
Ireland
have
had
their
say
Huh
said
Ron
staring
openmouthed
the
veela
who
had
now
lined
along
one
side
the
field
Hermione
made
loud
tutting
noise
She
reached
and
pulled
Harry
back
into
his
seat
Honestly
she
said
And
now
roared
Ludo
Bagman
voice
kindly
put
your
wands
the
air
for
the
Irish
National
Team
Mascots
Next
moment
what
seemed
great
green
and
gold
comet
came
zooming
into
the
stadium
did
one
circuit
the
stadium
then
split
into
two
smaller
comets
each
hurtling
toward
the
goal
posts
rainbow
arced
suddenly
across
the
field
connecting
the
two
balls

The
crowd
oooohed
and
aaaaahed
though
fireworks
display
Now
the
rainbow
faded
and
the
balls
light
reunited
and
merged
they
had
formed
great
shimmering
shamrock
which
rose
into
the
sky
and
began
soar
over
the
stands
Something
like
golden
rain
seemed
falling
from
Excellent
yelled
Ron
the
shamrock
soared
over
them
and
heavy
gold
coins
rained
from
bouncing
off
their
heads
and
seats
Squinting
the
shamrock
Harry
realized
that
was
actually
comprised
thousands
tiny

each
carrying

Weasley
over

were

gold
There

Ron
yelled
happily
stuffing

gold
coins
into
Harry
hand
for

Now

The
great
shamrock
dissolved
the
leprechauns
drifted
down
onto
the
field
the
opposite
side
from
the
veela
and
settled
themselves

the

And

down
waving
her
arms
the
air
while
Troy
did
lap
honor
around
the
field
Harry
looked
quickly
over
the
top
his
Omnioculars
and
saw
that
the
leprechauns
watching
from
the
sidelines
had
all
risen
into
the
air
again
and
formed
the
great
glittering
shamrock
Across
the
field
the
veela
were
watching
them
sulkily
Furious
with
himself
Harry
spun
his
speed
dial
back
normal
play
resumed
Harry
knew
enough
about
Quidditch
see
that
the
Irish
Chasers
were
superb
They
worked
seamless
team
their
movements
well
coordinated
that
they
appeared
reading
one
another
minds
they
positioned
themselves
and
the
rosette
Harry
chest
kept
squeaking
their
names
Troy
Mullet
ran
And
within
ten
minutes
Ireland
had
scored
twice
more
bringing
their
lead
thirty
zero
and
causing
thunderous
tide
roars
and
applause
from
the
green
clad
supporters
The
match
became
still
faster
but
more
brutal
Volkov
and
Vulchanov
the
Bulgarian
Beaters
were
whacking
the
Bludgers
fiercely
possible
the
Irish
Chasers
and
were
starting
prevent
them
from
using
some
their
best
moves
twice
they
were
forced

and
then
finally
Ivanova
managed

dodge
the
Keeper

and
score
Bulgaria
first

Fingers

Weasley
the
veela
started

Harry
screwed
his
eyes
too
wanted

After

Bagman
One

gasped
the
two
Seekers
Krum
and
Lynch
plummeted
through
the
center
the
Chasers
fast
that
looked
though
they
had
just
jumped
from
airplanes
without
parachutes
Harry
followed
their
descent
through
his
Omnioculars
squinting
see
where
the
Snitch
was
They
going
crash
screamed
Hermione
next
Harry
She
was
half
right
the
very
last
second
Viktor
Krum
pulled
out
the
dive
and
spiraled
off
Lynch
however
hit
the
ground
with
dull
thud
that
could
heard
throughout
the
stadium
huge
groan
rose
from
the
Irish
seats

Which

Krum
was
after

Harry
hastily
pressed
the
replay
and
play
play
buttons
his
Omnioculars
twiddled
the
speed
dial
and
put
them
back

read
the
shining
purple
lettering
across
his
lenses
saw
Krum
face
contorted
with
concentration
pulled
out
the
dive
just
time
while
Lynch
was
flattened
and
understood
Krum
hadn
seen
the
Snitch
all
was
just
making
Lynch
copy
him
Harry
had
never
seen
anyone
fly
like
that
Krum
hardly
looked
though
was
using
broomstick
all
moved
easily
through
the
air
that
looked
unsupported
and
weightless
Harry
turned
his
Omnioculars
back
normal
and
focused
them
Krum
was
now
circling
high
above
Lynch
who
was
being
revived
mediwizards
with

Harry
focusing
still
more
closely
upon
Krum
face
saw
his
dark
eyes
darting
all
over
the
ground
hundred
feet
below
was

look
for
the

without

Lynch
got
his
feet
last
loud
cheers
from
the
green
clad
supporters
mounted
his
Firebolt
and
kicked
back
off
into
the
air
His
revival
seemed
give
Ireland
new
heart
When
Mostafa
blew
his
whistle
again
the
Chasers
moved
into
action
with
skill
unrivaled
anything
Harry
had
seen
far
After
fifteen
more
fast
and
furious
minutes
Ireland
had
pulled
ahead
ten
more
goals
They
were
now
leading
one
hundred
and
thirty
points
ten
and
the
game
was
starting
get
dirtier
Mullet
shot
toward
the
goal
posts
yet
again
clutching
the
Quaffle
tightly
under
her
arm
the
Bulgarian
Keeper
Zograf
flew
out
meet
her
Whatever
happened
was
over
quickly
Harry
didn
catch
but
scream
rage
from
the
Irish
crowd
and
Mostafa
long
shrill
whistle
blast
told
him
had
been
foul
And
Mostafa
takes
the
Bulgarian
Keeper
task
for
cobbing
excessive
use
elbows
Bagman
informed
the
roaring
spectators
And
yes
penalty
Ireland
The
leprechauns
who
had
risen
angrily
into
the
air
like
swarm
glittering
hornets
when
Mullet
had
been
fouled
now
darted
together
form
the
words
The
veela
the
other
side
the
field
leapt
their
feet
tossed
their
hair
angrily
and
started
dance
again
one
the
Weasley
boys
and
Harry
stuffed
their
fingers
into
their
ears
but
Hermione
who
hadn
bothered
was
soon
tugging
Harry
arm
turned
look
her
and
she
pulled
his
fingers
impatiently
out
his
ears
Look
the
referee
she
said
giggling
Harry
looked
down
the
field
Hassan
Mostafa
had
landed
right
front
the
dancing
veela
and
was
acting
very
oddly
indeed
was
flexing
his
muscles
and
smoothing
his
mustache
excitedly
Now
can
have
that
said
Ludo
Bagman
though
sounded
highly
amused
Somebody
slap
the
referee
mediwizard
came
tearing
across
the
field
his
fingers
stuffed
into
his
own
ears
and
kicked
Mostafa
hard
the
shins
Mostafa
seemed
come
himself
Harry
watching
through
the
Omnioculars
again
saw
that
looked
exceptionally
embarrassed
and
had
started
shouting
the
veela
who
had
stopped
dancing
and
were
looking
mutinous
And
unless
much
mistaken
Mostafa
actually
attempting
send
off
the
Bulgarian
team
mascots
said
Bagman
voice
Now
there
something
haven
seen
before
this
could
turn
nasty
did
The
Bulgarian
Beaters
Volkov
and
Vulchanov
landed
either
side
Mostafa
and
began
arguing
furiously
with
him
gesticulating
toward
the
leprechauns
who
had
now
gleefully
formed
the
words
HEE
HEE
HEE
Mostafa
was
not
impressed
the
Bulgarians
arguments
however
was
jabbing
his
finger
into
the
air
clearly
telling
them
get
flying
again
and
when
they
refused
gave
two
short
blasts
his
whistle
Two
penalties
for
Ireland
shouted
Bagman
and
the
Bulgarian
crowd
howled
with
anger
And
Volkov
and
Vulchanov
had
better
get
back
those
brooms
yes
there
they
and
Troy
takes
the
Quaffle
Play
now
reached
level
ferocity
beyond
anything
they
had
yet
seen
The
Beaters
both
sides
were
acting
without
mercy
Volkov
and
Vulchanov
particular
seemed
not
care
whether
their
clubs
made
contact
with
Bludger
human
they
swung
them
violently
through
the
air
Dimitrov
shot
straight
Moran
who
had
the
Quaffle
nearly
knocking
her
off
her
broom
Foul
roared
the
Irish
supporters
one
all
standing
great
wave
green
Foul
echoed
Ludo
Bagman
magically
magnified
voice
Dimitrov
skins
Moran
deliberately
flying
collide
there
and
got
another
penalty
yes
there
the
whistle
The
leprechauns
had
risen
into
the
air
again
and
this
time
they
formed
giant
hand
which
was
making
very
rude
sign
indeed
the
veela
across
the
field
this
the
veela
lost
control
Instead
dancing
they
launched
themselves
across
the
field
and
began
throwing
what
seemed
handfuls
fire
the
leprechauns
Watching
through
his
Omnioculars
Harry
saw
that
they
didn
look
remotely
beautiful
now
the
contrary
their
faces
were
elongating
into
sharp
cruel
beaked
bird
heads
and
long
scaly
wings
were
bursting
from
their
shoulders
And
that
boys
yelled
Weasley
over
the
tumult
the
crowd
below
why
you
should
never
for
looks
alone
Ministry
wizards
were
flooding
onto
the
field
separate
the
veela
and
the
leprechauns
but
with
little
success
meanwhile
the
pitched
battle
below
was
nothing
the
one
taking
place
above
Harry
turned
this
way
and
that
staring
through
his
Omnioculars
the
Quaffie
changed
hands
with
the
speed
bullet
Levski
Dimitrov
Moran
Troy
Mullet
Ivanova
Moran
again
Moran
MORAN
SCORES
But
the
cheers
the
Irish
supporters
were
barely
heard
over
the
shrieks
the
veela
the
blasts
now
issuing
from
the
Ministry
members
wands
and
the
furious
roars
the
Bulgarians
The
game
recommenced
immediately
now
Levski
had
the
Quaffle
now
Dimitrov
The
Irish
Beater
Quigley
swung
heavily
passing
Bludger
and
hit
hard
possible
toward
Krum
who
did
not
duck
quickly
enough
hit
him
full
the
face
There
was
deafening
groan
from
the
crowd
Krum
nose
looked
broken
there
was
blood
everywhere
but
Hassan
Mostafa
didn
blow
his
whistle
had
become
distracted
and
Harry
couldn
blame
him
one
the
veela
had
thrown
handful
fire
and
set
his
broom
tail
alight
Harry
wanted
someone
realize
that
Krum
was
injured
even
though
was
supporting
Ireland
Krum
was
the
most
exciting
player
the
field
Ron
obviously
felt
the
same
Time
out
come
can
play
like
that
look
him
Look
Lynch
Harry
yelled
For
the
Irish
Seeker
had
suddenly
gone
into
dive
and
Harry
was
quite
sure
that
this
was
Wronski
Feint
this
was
the
real
thing
seen
the
Snitch
Harry
shouted
seen
Look
him
Half
the
crowd
seemed
have
realized
what
was
happening
the
Irish
supporters
rose
another
great
wave
green
screaming
their
Seeker
but
Krum
was
his
tail
How
could
see
where
was
going
Harry
had
idea
there
were
flecks
blood
flying
through
the
air
behind
him
but
was
drawing
level
with
Lynch
now
the
pair
them
hurtled
toward
the
ground
again
They
going
crash
shrieked
Hermione
They
not
roared
Ron
Lynch
yelled
Harry
And
was
right
for
the
second
time
Lynch
hit
the
ground
with
tremendous
force
and
was
immediately
stampeded
horde
angry
veela
The
Snitch
where
the
Snitch
bellowed
Charlie
along
the
row
got
Krum
got
all
over
shouted
Harry
Krum
his
red
robes
shining
with
blood
from
his
nose
was
rising
gently
into
the
air
his
fist
held
high
glint
gold
his
hand
The
scoreboard
was
flashing
BULGARIA
160
IRELAND
170
across
the
crowd
who
didn
seem
have
realized
what
had
happened
Then
slowly
though
great
jumbo
jet
were
revving
the
rumbling
from
the
Ireland
supporters
grew
louder
and
louder
and
erupted
into
screams
delight
IRELAND
WINS
Bagman
shouted
who
like
the
Irish
seemed
taken
aback
the
sudden
end
the
match
KRUM
GETS
THE
SNITCH
BUT
IRELAND
WINS
good
lord
don
think
any
were
expecting
that
What
did
catch
the
Snitch
for
Ron
bellowed
even
jumped
and
down
applauding
with
his
hands
over
his
head
ended
when
Ireland
were
hundred
and
sixty
points
ahead
the
idiot
knew
they
were
never
going
catch
Harry
shouted
back
over
all
the
noise
also
applauding
loudly
The
Irish
Chasers
were
too
good
wanted
end
his
terms
that
all
was
very
brave
wasn
Hermione
said
leaning
forward
watch
Krum
land
swarm
mediwizards
blasted
path
through
the
battling
leprechauns
and
veela
get
him
looks
terrible
mess
Harry
put
his
Omnioculars
his
eyes
again
was
hard
see
what
was
happening
below
because
leprechauns
were
zooming
delightedly
all
over
the
field
but
could
just
make
out
Krum
surrounded
mediwizards
looked
surlier
than
ever
and
refused
let
them
mop
him
His
team
members
were
around
him
shaking
their
heads
and
looking
dejected
short
way
away
the
Irish
players
were
dancing
gleefully
shower
gold
descending
from
their
mascots
Flags
were
waving
all
over
the
stadium
the
Irish
national
anthem
blared
from
all
sides
the
veela
were
shrinking
back
into
their
usual
beautiful
selves
now
though
looking
dispirited
and
forlorn
Vell
fought
bravely
said
gloomy
voice
behind
Harry
looked
around
was
the
Bulgarian
Minister
Magic
You
can
speak
English
said
Fudge
sounding
outraged
And
you
been
letting
mime
everything
all
day
Veil
vos
very
funny
said
the
Bulgarian
minister
shrugging
And
the
Irish
team
performs
lap
honor
flanked
their
mascots
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
itself
brought
into
the
Top
Box
roared
Bagman
Harry
eyes
were
suddenly
dazzled
blinding
white
light
the
Top
Box
was
magically
illuminated
that
everyone
the
stands
could
see
the
inside
Squinting
toward
the
entrance
saw
two
panting
wizards
carrying
vast
golden
cup
into
the
box
which
they
handed
Cornelius
Fudge
who
was
still
looking
very
disgruntled
that
been
using
sign
language
all
day
for
nothing
Let
have
really
loud
hand
for
the
gallant
losers
Bulgaria
Bagman
shouted
And
the
stairs
into
the
box
came
the
seven
defeated
Bulgarian
players
The
crowd
below
was
applauding
appreciatively
Harry
could
see
thousands
and
thousands
Omniocular
lenses
flashing
and
winking
their
direction
One
one
the
Bulgarians
filed
between
the
rows
seats
the
box
and
Bagman
called
out
the
name
each
they
shook
hands
with
their
own
minister
and
then
with
Fudge
Krum
who
was
last
line
looked
real
mess
Two
black
eyes
were
blooming
spectacularly
his
bloody
face
was
still
holding
the
Snitch
Harry
noticed
that
seemed
much
less
coordinated
the
ground
was
slightly
duck
footed
and
distinctly
round
shouldered
But
when
Krum
name
was
announced
the
whole
stadium
gave
him
resounding
earsplitting
roar
And
then
came
the
Irish
team
Aidan
Lynch
was
being
supported
Moran
and
Connolly
the
second
crash
seemed
have
dazed
him
and
his
eyes
looked
strangely
unfocused
But
grinned
happily
Troy
and
Quigley
lifted
the
Cup
into
the
air
and
the
crowd
below
thundered
its
approval
Harry
hands
were
numb
with
clapping
last
when
the
Irish
team
had
left
the
box
perform
another
lap
honor
their
brooms
Aidan
Lynch
the
back
Confolly
clutching
hard
around
his
waist
and
still
grinning
bemused
sort
way
Bagman
pointed
his
wand
his
throat
and
muttered
Quietus
They
talking
about
this
one
for
years
said
hoarsely
really
unexpected
twist
that
shame
couldn
have
lasted
longer
yes
yes
owe
you
how
much
For
Fred
and
George
had
just
scrambled
over
the
backs
their
seats
and
were
standing
front
Ludo
Bagman
with
broad
grins
their
faces
their
hands
outstretched
CHAPTER
NINE
THE
DARK
MARK
Don
tell
your
mother
you
been
gambling
Weasley
implored
Fred
and
George
they
all
made
their
way
slowly
down
the
purple
carpeted
stairs
Don
worry
Dad
said
Fred
gleefully
got
big
plans
for
this
money
don
want
confiscated
Weasley
looked
for
moment
though
was
going
ask
what
these
big
plans
were
but
seemed
decide
upon
reflection
that
didn
want
know
They
were
soon
caught
the
crowds
now
flooding
out
the
stadium
and
back
their
campsites
Raucous
singing
was
borne
toward
them
the
night
air
they
retraced
their
steps
along
the
lantern
lit
path
and
leprechauns
kept
shooting
over
their
heads
cackling
and
waving
their
lanterns
When
they
finally
reached
the
tents
nobody
felt
like
sleeping
all
and
given
the
level
noise
around
them
Weasley
agreed
that
they
could
all
have
one
last
cup
cocoa
together
before
turning
They
were
soon
arguing
enjoyably
about
the
match
Weasley
got
drawn
into
disagreement
about
cobbing
with
Charlie
and
was
only
when
Ginny
fell
asleep
right
the
tiny
table
and
spilled
hot
chocolate
all
over
the
floor
that
Weasley
called
halt
the
verbal
replays
and
insisted
that
everyone
bed
Hermione
and
Ginny
went
into
the
next
tent
and
Harry
and
the
rest
the
Weasleys
changed
into
pajamas
and
clambered
into
their
bunks
From
the
other
side
the
campsite
they
could
still
hear
much
singing
and
the
odd
echoing
bang
glad
not
duty
muttered
Weasley
sleepily
wouldn
fancy
having
and
tell
the
Irish
they
got
stop
celebrating
Harry
who
was
top
bunk
above
Ron
lay
staring
the
canvas
ceiling
the
tent
watching
the
glow
occasional
leprechaun
lantern
flying
overhead
and
picturing
again
some
Krum
more
spectacular
moves
was
itching
get
back
his
own
Firebolt
and
try
out
the
Wronski
Feint
Somehow
Oliver
Wood
had
never
managed
convey
with
all
his
wriggling
diagrams
what
that
move
was
supposed
look
like
Harry
saw
himself
robes
that
had
his
name
the
back
and
imagined
the
sensation
hearing
hundred
thousand
strong
crowd
roar
Ludo
Bagman
voice
echoed
throughout
the
stadium
give
you
Potter
Harry
never
knew
whether
not
had
actually
dropped
off
sleep
his
fantasies
flying
like
Krum
might
well
have
slipped
into
actual
dreams
all
knew
was
that
quite
suddenly
Weasley
was
shouting
Get
Ron
Harry
come
now
get
this
urgent
Harry
sat
quickly
and
the
top
his
head
hit
canvas
matter
said
Dimly
could
tell
that
something
was
wrong
The
noises
the
campsite
had
changed
The
singing
had
stopped
could
hear
screams
and
the
sound
people
running
slipped
down
from
the
bunk
and
reached
for
his
clothes
but
Weasley
who
had
pulled
his
jeans
over
his
own
pajamas
said
time
Harry
just
grab
jacket
and
get
outside
quickly
Harry
did
was
told
and
hurried
out
the
tent
Ron
his
heels
the
light
the
few
fires
that
were
still
burning
could
see
people
running
away
into
the
woods
fleeing
something
that
was
moving
across
the
field
toward
them
something
that
was
emitting
odd
flashes
light
and
noises
like
gunfire
Loud
jeering
roars
laughter
and
drunken
yells
were
drifting
toward
them
then
came
burst
strong
green
light
which
illuminated
the
scene
crowd
wizards
tightly
packed
and
moving
together
with
wands
pointing
straight
upward
was
marching
slowly
across
the
field
Harry
squinted
them
They
didn
seem
have
faces
Then
realized
that
their
heads
were
hooded
and
their
faces
masked
High
above
them
floating
along
midair
four
struggling
figures
were
being
contorted
into
grotesque
shapes
was
though
the
masked
wizards
the
ground
were
puppeteers
and
the
people
above
them
were
marionettes
operated
invisible
strings
that
rose
from
the
wands
into
the
air
Two
the
figures
were
very
small
More
wizards
were
joining
the
marching
group
laughing
and
pointing
the
floating
bodies
Tents
crumpled
and
fell
the
marching
crowd
swelled
Once
twice
Harry
saw
one
the
marchers
blast
tent
out
his
way
with
his
wand
Several
caught
fire
The
screaming
grew
louder
The
floating
people
were
suddenly
illuminated
they
passed
over
burning
tent
and
Harry
recognized
one
them
Roberts
the
campsite
manager
The
other
three
looked
though
they
might
his
wife
and
children
One
the
marchers
below
flipped
Mrs
Roberts
upside
down
with
his
wand
her
nightdress
fell
down
reveal
voluminous
drawers
and
she
struggled
cover
herself
the
crowd
below
her
screeched
and
hooted
with
glee
That
sick
Ron
muttered
watching
the
smallest
Muggle
child
who
had
begun
spin
like
top
sixty
feet
above
the
ground
his
head
flopping
limply
from
side
side
That
really
sick
Hermione
and
Ginny
came
hurrying
toward
them
pulling
coats
over
their
nightdresses
with
Weasley
right
behind
them
the
same
moment
Bill
Charlie
and
Percy
emerged
from
the
boys
tent
fully
dressed
with
their
sleeves
rolled
and
their
wands
out
going
help
the
Ministry
Weasley
shouted
over
all
the
noise
rolling
his
own
sleeves
You
lot
get
into
the
woods
and
stick
together
come
and
fetch
you
when
sorted
this
out
Bill
Charlie
and
Percy
were
already
sprinting
away
toward
the
oncoming
marchers
Weasley
tore
after
them
Ministry
wizards
were
dashing
from
every
direction
toward
the
source
the
trouble
The
crowd
beneath
the
Roberts
family
was
coming
ever
closer
mon
said
Fred
grabbing
Ginny
hand
and
starting
pull
her
toward
the
wood
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
George
followed
They
all
looked
back
they
reached
the
trees
The
crowd
beneath
the
Roberts
family
was
larger
than
ever
they
could
see
the
Ministry
wizards
trying
get
through
the
hooded
wizards
the
center
but
they
were
having
great
difficulty
looked
though
they
were
scared
perform
any
spell
that
might
make
the
Roberts
family
fall
The
colored
lanterns
that
had
lit
the
path
the
stadium
had
been
extinguished
Dark
figures
were
blundering
through
the
trees
children
were
crying
anxious
shouts
and
panicked
voices
were
reverberating
around
them
the
cold
night
air
Harry
felt
himself
being
pushed
hither
and
thither
people
whose
faces
could
not
see
Then
heard
Ron
yell
with
pain
What
happened
said
Hermione
anxiously
stopping
abruptly
that
Harry
walked
into
her
Ron
where
are
you
this
stupid
lumos
She
illuminated
her
wand
and
directed
its
narrow
beam
across
the
path
Ron
was
lying
sprawled
the
ground
Tripped
over
tree
root
said
angrily
getting
his
feet
again
Well
with
feet
that
size
hard
not
said
drawling
voice
from
behind
them
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
turned
sharply
Draco
Malfoy
was
standing
alone
nearby
leaning
against
tree
looking
utterly
relaxed
His
arms
folded
seemed
have
been
watching
the
scene
the
campsite
through
gap
the
trees
Ron
told
Malfoy
something
that
Harry
knew
would
never
have
dared
say
front
Mrs
Weasley
Language
Weasley
said
Malfoy
his
pale
eyes
glittering
Hadn
you
better
hurrying
along
now
You
wouldn
like
her
spotted
would
you
nodded
Hermione
and
the
same
moment
blast
like
bomb
sounded
from
the
campsite
and
flash
green
light
momentarily
lit
the
trees
around
them
What
that
supposed
mean
said
Hermione
defiantly
Granger
they
after
Muggles
said
Malfoy
you
want
showing
off
your
knickers
midair
Because
you
hang
around
they
moving
this
way
and
would
give
all
laugh
Hermione
witch
Harry
snarled
Have
your
own
way
Potter
said
Malfoy
grinning
maliciously
you
think
they
can
spot
Mudblood
stay
where
you
are
You
watch
your
mouth
shouted
Ron
Everybody
present
knew
that
Mudblood
was
very
offensive
term
for
witch
wizard
Muggle
parentage
Never
mind
Ron
said
Hermione
quickly
seizing
Ron
arm
restrain
him
took
step
toward
Malfoy
There
came
bang
from
the
other
side
the
trees
that
was
louder
than
anything
they
had
heard
Several
people
nearby
screamed
Malfoy
chuckled
softly
Scare
easily
don
they
said
lazily
suppose
your
daddy
told
you
all
hide
What
trying
rescue
the
Muggles
Where
your
parents
said
Harry
his
temper
rising
Out
there
wearing
masks
are
they
Malfoy
turned
his
face
Harry
still
smiling
Well
they
were
wouldn
likely
tell
you
would
Potter
come
said
Hermione
with
disgusted
look
Malfoy
let
and
find
the
others
Keep
that
big
bushy
head
down
Granger
sneered
Malfoy
Come
Hermione
repeated
and
she
pulled
Harry
and
Ron
the
path
again
bet
you
anything
his
dad
one
that
masked
lot
said
Ron
hotly
Well
with
any
luck
the
Ministry
will
catch
him
said
Hermione
fervently
can
believe
this
Where
have
the
others
got
Fred
George
and
Ginny
were
nowhere
seen
though
the
path
was
packed
with
plenty
other
people
all
looking
nervously
over
their
shoulders
toward
the
commotion
back
the
campsite
huddle
teenagers
pajamas
was
arguing
vociferously
little
way
along
the
path
When
they
saw
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
girl
with
thick
curly
hair
turned
and
said
quickly
est
Madame
Maxime
Nous
avons
perdue
what
said
Ron
The
girl
who
had
spoken
turned
her
back
him
and
they
walked
they
distinctly
heard
her
say
Ogwarts
Beauxbatons
muttered
Hermione
Sorry
said
Harry
They
must
Beauxbatons
said
Hermione
You
know
Beauxbatons
Academy
Magic
read
about
Appraisal
ofMagical
Education
Europe
yeah
right
said
Harry
Fred
and
George
can
have
gone
that
far
said
Ron
pulling
out
his
wand
lighting
like
Hermione
and
squinting
the
path
Harry
dug
the
pockets
his
jacket
for
his
own
wand
but
wasn
there
The
only
thing
could
find
was
his
Omnioculars
don
believe
lost
wand
You
kidding
Ron
and
Hermione
raised
their
wands
high
enough
spread
the
narrow
beams
light
farther
the
ground
Harry
looked
all
around
him
but
his
wand
was
nowhere
seen
Maybe
back
the
tent
said
Ron
Maybe
fell
out
your
pocket
when
were
running
Hermione
suggested
anxiously
Yeah
said
Harry
maybe
usually
kept
his
wand
with
him
all
times
the
wizarding
world
and
finding
himself
without
the
midst
scene
like
this
made
him
feel
very
vulnerable
rustling
noise
nearby
made
all
three
them
jump
Winky
the
house
elf
was
fighting
her
way
out
clump
bushes
nearby
She
was
moving
most
peculiar
fashion
apparently
with
great
difficulty
was
though
someone
invisible
were
trying
hold
her
back
There
bad
wizards
about
she
squeaked
distractedly
she
leaned
forward
and
labored
keep
running
People
high
high
the
air
Winky
getting
out
the
way
And
she
disappeared
into
the
trees
the
other
side
the
path
panting
and
squeaking
she
fought
the
force
that
was
restraining
her
What
with
her
said
Ron
looking
curiously
after
Winky
Why
can
she
run
properly
Bet
she
didn
ask
permission
hide
said
Harry
was
thinking
Dobby
Every
time
had
tried
something
the
Malfoys
wouldn
like
the
house
elf
had
been
forced
start
beating
himself
You
know
house
elves
get
very
raw
deal
said
Hermione
indignantly
slavery
that
what
That
Crouch
made
her
the
top
the
stadium
and
she
was
terrified
and
got
her
bewitched
she
can
even
run
when
they
start
trampling
tents
Why
doesn
anyone
something
about
Well
the
elves
are
happy
aren
they
Ron
said
You
heard
old
Winky
back
the
match
House
elves
not
supposed
have
fun
that
what
she
likes
being
bossed
around
people
like
you
Ron
Hermione
began
hotly
who
prop
rotten
and
unjust
systems
just
because
they
too
lazy
Another
loud
bang
echoed
from
the
edge
the
wood
Let
just
keep
moving
shall
said
Ron
and
Harry
saw
him
glance
edgily
Hermione
Perhaps
there
was
truth
what
Malfoy
had
said
perhaps
Hermione
was
more
danger
than
they
were
They
set
off
again
Harry
still
searching
his
pockets
even
though
knew
his
wand
wasn
there
They
followed
the
dark
path
deeper
into
the
wood
still
keeping
eye
out
for
Fred
George
and
Ginny
They
passed
group
goblins
who
were
cackling
over
sack
gold
that
they
had
undoubtedly
won
betting
the
match
and
who
seemed
quite
unperturbed
the
trouble
the
campsite
Farther
still
along
the
path
they
walked
into
patch
silvery
light
and
when
they
looked
through
the
trees
they
saw
three
tall
and
beautiful
veela
standing
clearing
surrounded
gaggle
young
wizards
all
whom
were
talking
very
loudly
pull
down
about
hundred
sacks
Galleons
year
one
them
shouted
dragon
killer
for
the
Committee
for
the
Disposal
Dangerous
Creatures
you
not
yelled
his
friend
You
dishwasher
the
Leaky
Cauldron
but
vampire
hunter
killed
about
ninety
far
third
young
wizard
whose
pimples
were
visible
even
the
dim
silvery
light
the
veela
now
cut
about
become
the
youngest
ever
Minister
Magic
Harry
snorted
with
laughter
recognized
the
pimply
wizard
His
name
was
Stan
Shunpike
and
was
fact
conductor
the
triple
decker
Knight
Bus
turned
tell
Ron
this
but
Ron
face
had
gone
oddly
slack
and
next
second
Ron
was
yelling
Did
tell
you
invented
broomstick
that
reach
Jupiter
Honestly
said
Hermione
and
she
and
Harry
grabbed
Ron
firmly
the
arms
wheeled
him
around
and
marched
him
away
the
time
the
sounds
the
veela
and
their
admirers
had
faded
completely
they
were
the
very
heart
the
wood
They
seemed
alone
now
everything
was
much
quieter
Harry
looked
around
reckon
can
just
wait
here
you
know
hear
anyone
coming
mile
off
The
words
were
hardly
out
his
mouth
when
Ludo
Bagman
emerged
from
behind
tree
right
ahead
them
Even
the
feeble
light
the
two
wands
Harry
could
see
that
great
change
had
come
over
Bagman
longer
looked
buoyant
and
rosy
faced
there
was
more
spring
his
step
looked
very
white
and
strained
Who
that
said
blinking
down
them
trying
make
out
their
faces
What
are
you
doing
here
all
alone
They
looked
one
another
surprised
Well
there
sort
riot
going
said
Ron
Bagman
stared
him
What
the
campsite
some
people
have
got
hold
family
Muggles
Bagman
swore
loudly
Damn
them
said
looking
quite
distracted
and
without
another
word
Disapparated
with
small
pop
Not
exactly
top
things
Bagman
said
Hermione
frowning
was
great
Beater
though
said
Ron
leading
the
way
off
the
path
into
small
clearing
and
sitting
down
patch
dry
grass
the
foot
tree
The
Wimbourne
Wasps
won
the
league
three
times
row
while
was
with
them
took
his
small
figure
Krum
out
his
pocket
set
down
the
ground
and
watched
walk
around
Like
the
real
Krum
the
model
was
slightly
duck
footed
and
round
shouldered
much
less
impressive
his
splayed
feet
than
his
broomstick
Harry
was
listening
for
noise
from
the
campsite
Everything
seemed
much
quieter
perhaps
the
riot
was
over
hope
the
others
are
okay
said
Hermione
after
while
They
fine
said
Ron
Imagine
your
dad
catches
Lucius
Malfoy
said
Harry
sitting
down
next
Ron
and
watching
the
small
figure
Krum
slouching
over
the
fallen
leaves
always
said
like
get
something
him
That
wipe
the
smirk
off
old
Draco
face
all
right
said
Ron
Those
poor
Muggles
though
said
Hermione
nervously
What
they
can
get
them
down
They
will
said
Ron
reassuringly
They
find
way
Mad
though
something
like
that
when
the
whole
Ministry
Magic
out
here
tonight
said
Hermione
mean
how
they
expect
get
away
with
you
think
they
been
drinking
are
they
just
But
she
broke
off
abruptly
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
Harry
and
Ron
looked
quickly
around
too
sounded
though
someone
was
staggering
toward
their
clearing
They
waited
listening
the
sounds
the
uneven
steps
behind
the
dark
trees
But
the
footsteps
came
sudden
halt
Hello
called
Harry
There
was
silence
Harry
got
his
feet
and
peered
around
the
tree
was
too
dark
see
very
far
but
could
sense
somebody
standing
just
beyond
the
range
his
vision
Who
there
said
And
then
without
warning
the
silence
was
rent
voice
unlike
any
they
had
heard
the
wood
and
uttered
not
panicked
shout
but
what
sounded
like
spell
MORSMORDRE
And
something
vast
green
and
glittering
erupted
from
the
patch
darkness
Harry
eyes
had
been
struggling
penetrate
flew
over
the
treetops
and
into
the
sky
What
the
gasped
Ron
sprang
his
feet
again
staring
the
thing
that
had
appeared
For
split
second
Harry
thought
was
another
leprechaun
formation
Then
realized
that
was
colossal
skull
comprised
what
looked
like
emerald
stars
with
serpent
protruding
from
its
mouth
like
tongue
they
watched
rose
higher
and
higher
blazing
haze
greenish
smoke
etched
against
the
black
sky
like
new
constellation
Suddenly
the
wood
all
around
them
erupted
with
screams
Harry
didn
understand
why
but
the
only
possible
cause
was
the
sudden
appearance
the
skull
which
had
now
risen
high
enough
illuminate
the
entire
wood
like
some
grisly
neon
sign
scanned
the
darkness
for
the
person
who
had
conjured
the
skull
but
couldn
see
anyone
Who
there
called
again
Harry
come
move
Hermione
had
seized
the
collar
his
jacket
and
was
tugging
him
backward
What
the
matter
Harry
said
startled
see
her
face
white
and
terrified
the
Dark
Mark
Harry
Hermione
moaned
pulling
him
hard
she
could
You
Know
Who
sign
Voldemort
Harry
come
Harry
turned
Ron
was
hurriedly
scooping
his
miniature
Krum
the
three
them
started
across
the
clearing
but
before
they
had
taken
few
hurried
steps
series
popping
noises
announced
the
arrival
twenty
wizards
appearing
from
thin
air
surrounding
them
Harry
whirled
around
and
instant
registered
one
fact
Each
these
wizards
had
his
wand
out
and
every
wand
was
pointing
right
himself
Ron
and
Hermione
Without
pausing
think
yelled
DUCK
seized
the
other
two
and
pulled
them
down
onto
the
ground
STUPEFY
roared
twenty
voices
there
was
blinding
series
flashes
and
Harry
felt
the
hair
his
head
ripple
though
powerful
wind
had
swept
the
clearing
Raising
his
head
fraction
inch
saw
jets
fiery
red
light
flying
over
them
from
the
wizards
wands
crossing
one
another
bouncing
off
tree
trunks
rebounding
into
the
darkness
Stop
yelled
voice
recognized
STOP
That
son
Harry
hair
stopped
blowing
about
raised
his
head
little
higher
The
wizard
front
him
had
lowered
his
wand
rolled
over
and
saw
Weasley
striding
toward
them
looking
terrified
Ron
Harry
his
voice
sounded
shaky
Hermione
are
you
all
right
Out
the
way
Arthur
said
cold
curt
voice
was
Crouch
and
the
other
Ministry
wizards
were
closing
them
Harry
got
his
feet
face
them
Crouch
face
was
taut
with
rage
Which
you
did
snapped
his
sharp
eyes
darting
between
them
Which
you
conjured
the
Dark
Mark
didn
that
said
Harry
gesturing
the
skull
didn
anything
said
Ron
who
was
rubbing
his
elbow
and
looking
indignantly
his
father
What
did
you
want
attack
for
not
lie
sir
shouted
Crouch
His
wand
was
still
pointing
directly
Ron
and
his
eyes
were
popping
looked
slightly
mad
You
have
been
discovered
the
scene
the
crime
Barty
whispered
witch
long
woolen
dressing
gown
they
kids
Barty
they
never
have
been
able
Where
did
the
Mark
come
from
you
three
said
Weasley
quickly
Over
there
said
Hermione
shakily
pointing
the
place
where
they
had
heard
the
voice
There
was
someone
behind
the
trees
they
shouted
words
incantation
stood
over
there
did
they
said
Crouch
turning
his
popping
eyes
Hermione
now
disbelief
etched
all
over
his
face
Said
incantation
did
they
You
seem
very
well
informed
about
how
that
Mark
summoned
missy
But
none
the
Ministry
wizards
apart
from
Crouch
seemed
think
remotely
likely
that
Harry
Ron
Hermione
had
conjured
the
skull
the
contrary
Hermione
words
they
had
all
raised
their
wands
again
and
were
pointing
the
direction
she
had
indicated
squinting
through
the
dark
trees
too
late
said
the
witch
the
woolen
dressing
gown
shaking
her
head
They
have
Disapparated
don
think
said
wizard
with
scrubby
brown
beard
was
Amos
Diggory
Cedric
father
Our
Stunners
went
right
through
those
trees
There
good
chance
got
them
Amos
careful
said
few
the
wizards
warningly
Diggory
squared
his
shoulders
raised
his
wand
marched
across
the
clearing
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
Hermione
watched
him
vanish
with
her
hands
over
her
mouth
few
seconds
later
they
heard
Diggory
shout
Yes
got
them
There
someone
here
Unconscious
but
blimey
You
got
someone
shouted
Crouch
sounding
highly
disbelieving
Who
Who
They
heard
snapping
twigs
the
rustling
leaves
and
then
crunching
footsteps
Diggory
reemerged
from
behind
the
trees
was
carrying
tiny
limp
figure
his
arms
Harry
recognized
the
tea
towel
once
was
Winky
Crouch
did
not
move
speak
Diggory
deposited
his
elf
the
ground
his
feet
The
other
Ministry
wizards
were
all
staring
Crouch
For
few
seconds
Crouch
remained
transfixed
his
eyes
blazing
his
white
face
stared
down
Winky
Then
appeared
come
life
again
This
cannot
said
jerkily
moved
quickly
around
Diggory
and
strode
off
toward
the
place
where
had
found
Winky
point
Crouch
Diggory
called
after
him
There
one
else
there
But
Crouch
did
not
seem
prepared
take
his
word
for
They
could
hear
him
moving
around
and
the
rustling
leaves
pushed
the
bushes
aside
searching
Bit
embarrassing
Diggory
said
grimly
looking
down
Winky
unconscious
form
Barty
Crouch
house
elf
mean
say
Come
off
Amos
said
Weasley
quietly
you
don
seriously
think
was
the
elf
The
Dark
Mark
wizard
sign
requires
wand
Yeah
said
Diggory
and
she
had
wand
What
said
Weasley
Here
look
Diggory
held
wand
and
showed
Weasley
Had
her
hand
that
clause
three
the
Code
Wand
Use
broken
for
start
non
human
creature
permitted
carry
use
wand
Just
then
there
was
another
pop
and
Ludo
Bagman
Apparated
right
next
Weasley
Looking
breathless
and
disorientated
spun
the
spot
goggling
upward
the
emerald
green
skull
The
Dark
Mark
panted
almost
trampling
Winky
turned
inquiringly
his
colleagues
Who
did
Did
you
get
them
Barry
What
going
Crouch
had
returned
empty
handed
His
face
was
still
ghostly
white
and
his
hands
and
his
toothbrush
mustache
were
both
twitching
Where
have
you
been
Barty
said
Bagman
Why
weren
you
the
match
Your
elf
was
saving
you
seat
too
gulping
gargoyles
Bagman
had
just
noticed
Winky
lying
his
feet
What
happened
her
have
been
busy
Ludo
said
Crouch
still
talking
the
same
jerky
fashion
barely
moving
his
lips
And
elf
has
been
stunned
Stunned
you
lot
you
mean
But
why
Comprehension
dawned
suddenly
Bagman
round
shiny
face
looked
the
skull
down
Winky
and
then
Crouch
said
Winky
Conjure
the
Dark
Mark
She
wouldn
know
how
She
need
wand
for
start
And
she
had
one
said
Diggory
found
her
holding
one
Ludo
all
right
with
you
Crouch
think
should
hear
what
she
got
say
for
herself
Crouch
gave
sign
that
had
heard
Diggory
but
Diggory
seemed
take
his
silence
for
assent
raised
his
own
wand
pointed
Winky
and
said
Ennervate
Winky
stirred
feebly
Her
great
brown
eyes
opened
and
she
blinked
several
times
bemused
sort
way
Watched
the
silent
wizards
she
raised
herself
shakily
into
sitting
position
She
caught
sight
Diggory
feet
and
slowly
tremulously
raised
her
eyes
stare
into
his
face
then
more
slowly
still
she
looked
into
the
sky
Harry
could
see
the
floating
skull
reflected
twice
her
enormous
glassy
eyes
She
gave
gasp
looked
wildly
around
the
crowded
clearing
and
burst
into
terrified
sobs
Elf
said
Diggory
sternly
you
know
who
member
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
Magical
Creatures
Winky
began
rock
backward
and
forward
the
ground
her
breath
coming
sharp
bursts
Harry
was
reminded
forcibly
Dobby
his
moments
terrified
disobedience
you
see
elf
the
Dark
Mark
was
conjured
here
short
while
ago
said
Diggory
And
you
were
discovered
moments
later
right
beneath
explanation
you
please
not
doing
sir
Winky
gasped
not
knowing
how
sir
You
were
found
with
wand
your
hand
barked
Diggory
brandishing
front
her
And
the
wand
caught
the
green
light
that
was
filling
the
clearing
from
the
skull
above
Harry
recognized
Hey
that
mine
said
Everyone
the
clearing
looked
him
Excuse
said
Diggory
incredulously
That
wand
said
Harry
dropped
You
dropped
repeated
Diggory
disbelief
this
confession
You
threw
aside
after
you
conjured
the
Mark
Amos
think
who
you
talking
said
Weasley
very
angrily
Harry
Potter
likely
conjure
the
Dark
Mark
course
not
mumbled
Diggory
Sorry
carried
away
didn
drop
there
anyway
said
Harry
jerking
his
thumb
toward
the
trees
beneath
the
skull
missed
right
after
got
into
the
wood
said
Diggory
his
eyes
hardening
turned
look
Winky
again
cowering
his
feet
You
found
this
wand
elf
And
you
picked
and
thought
you
have
some
fun
with
did
you
not
doing
magic
with
sir
squealed
Winky
tears
streaming
down
the
sides
her
squashed
and
bulbous
nose
just
picking
sir
not
making
the
Dark
Mark
sir
not
knowing
how
wasn
her
said
Hermione
She
looked
very
nervous
speaking
front
all
these
Ministry
wizards
yet
determined
all
the
same
Winky
got
squeaky
little
voice
and
the
voice
heard
doing
the
incantation
was
much
deeper
She
looked
around
Harry
and
Ron
appealing
for
their
support
didn
sound
anything
like
Winky
did
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
definitely
didn
sound
like
elf
Yeah
was
human
voice
said
Ron
Well
soon
see
growled
Diggory
looking
unimpressed
There
simple
way
discovering
the
last
spell
wand
performed
elf
did
you
know
that
Winky
trembled
and
shook
her
head
frantically
her
ears
flapping
Diggory
raised
his
own
wand
again
and
placed
tip
tip
with
Harry
Prior
Incantato
roared
Diggory
Harry
heard
Hermione
gasp
horrified
gigantic
serpent
tongued
skull
erupted
from
the
point
where
the
two
wands
met
but
was
mere
shadow
the
green
skull
high
above
them
looked
though
were
made
thick
gray
smoke
the
ghost
spell
Deletrius
Diggory
shouted
and
the
smoky
skull
vanished
wisp
smoke
said
Diggory
with
kind
savage
triumph
looking
down
upon
Winky
who
was
still
shaking
convulsively
not
doing
she
squealed
her
eyes
rolling
terror
not
not
not
knowing
how
good
elf
isn
using
wands
isn
knowing
how
You
been
caught
red
handed
elf
Diggory
roared
Caught
with
the
guilty
wand
your
hand
Amos
said
Weasley
loudly
think
about
precious
few
wizards
know
how
that
spell
Where
would
she
have
learned
Perhaps
Amos
suggesting
said
Crouch
cold
anger
every
syllable
that
routinely
teach
servants
conjure
the
Dark
Mark
There
was
deeply
unpleasant
silence
Amos
Diggory
looked
horrified
Crouch
not
not
all
You
have
now
come
very
close
accusing
the
two
people
this
clearing
who
are
least
likely
conjure
that
Mark
barked
Crouch
Harry
Potter
and
myself
suppose
you
are
familiar
with
the
boy
story
Amos
course
everyone
knows
muttered
Diggory
looking
highly
discomforted
And
trust
you
remember
the
many
proofs
have
given
over
long
career
that
despise
and
detest
the
Dark
Arts
and
those
who
practice
them
Crouch
shouted
his
eyes
bulging
again
Crouch
never
suggested
you
had
anything
with
Amos
Diggory
muttered
again
now
reddening
behind
his
scrubby
brown
beard
you
accuse
elf
you
accuse
Diggory
shouted
Crouch
Where
else
would
she
have
learned
conjure
She
she
might
picked
anywhere
Precisely
Amos
said
Weasley
She
might
have
picked
anywhere
Winky
said
kindly
turning
the
elf
but
she
flinched
though
too
was
shouting
her
Where
exactly
did
you
find
Harry
wand
Winky
was
twisting
the
hem
her
tea
towel
violently
that
was
fraying
beneath
her
fingers
finding
finding
there
sir
she
whispered
there
the
trees
sir
You
see
Amos
said
Weasley
Whoever
conjured
the
Mark
could
have
Disapparated
right
after
they
done
leaving
Harry
wand
behind
clever
thing
not
using
their
own
wand
which
could
have
betrayed
them
And
Winky
here
had
the
misfortune
come
across
the
wand
moments
later
and
pick
But
then
she
have
been
only
few
feet
away
from
the
real
culprit
said
Diggory
impatiently
Elf
Did
you
see
anyone
Winky
began
tremble
worse
than
ever
Her
giant
eyes
flickered
from
Diggory
Ludo
Bagman
and
onto
Crouch
Then
she
gulped
and
said
seeing
one
sir
one
Amos
said
Crouch
curtly
fully
aware
that
the
ordinary
course
events
you
would
want
take
Winky
into
your
department
for
questioning
ask
you
however
allow
deal
with
her
Diggory
looked
though
didn
think
much
this
suggestion
all
but
was
clear
Harry
that
Crouch
was
such
important
member
the
Ministry
that
did
not
dare
refuse
him
You
may
rest
assured
that
she
will
punished
Crouch
added
coldly
master
Winky
stammered
looking
Crouch
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
master
please
Crouch
stared
back
his
face
somehow
sharpened
each
line
upon
more
deeply
etched
There
was
pity
his
gaze
Winky
has
behaved
tonight
manner
would
not
have
believed
possible
said
slowly
told
her
remain
the
tent
told
her
stay
there
while
went
sort
out
the
trouble
And
find
that
she
disobeyed
This
means
clothes
shrieked
Winky
prostrating
herself
Crouch
feet
master
Not
clothes
not
clothes
Harry
knew
that
the
only
way
turn
house
elf
free
was
present
with
proper
garments
was
pitiful
see
the
way
Winky
clutched
her
tea
towel
she
sobbed
over
Crouch
feet
But
she
was
frightened
Hermione
burst
out
angrily
glaring
Crouch
Your
elf
scared
heights
and
those
wizards
masks
were
levitating
people
You
can
blame
her
for
wanting
get
out
their
way
Crouch
took
step
backward
freeing
himself
from
contact
with
the
elf
whom
was
surveying
though
she
were
something
filthy
and
rotten
that
was
contaminating
his
over
shined
shoes
have
use
for
house
elf
who
disobeys
said
coldly
looking
over
Hermione
have
use
for
servant
who
forgets
what
due
her
master
and
her
master
reputation
Winky
was
crying
hard
that
her
sobs
echoed
around
the
clearing
There
was
very
nasty
silence
which
was
ended
Weasley
who
said
quietly
Well
think
take
lot
back
the
tent
nobody
got
any
objections
Amos
that
wand
told
all
can
Harry
could
have
back
please
Diggory
handed
Harry
his
wand
and
Harry
pocketed
Come
you
three
Weasley
said
quietly
But
Hermione
didn
seem
want
move
her
eyes
were
still
upon
the
sobbing
elf
Hermione
Weasley
said
more
urgently
She
turned
and
followed
Harry
and
Ron
out
the
clearing
and
off
through
the
trees
What
going
happen
Winky
said
Hermione
the
moment
they
had
left
the
clearing
don
know
said
Weasley
The
way
they
were
treating
her
said
Hermione
furiously
Diggory
calling
her
elf
all
the
time
and
Crouch
knows
she
didn
and
still
going
sack
her
didn
care
how
frightened
she
been
how
upset
she
was
was
like
she
wasn
even
human
Well

said
Ron
Hermione
rounded
him
That
doesn
mean
she
hasn
got

Ron
disgusting

way
Hermione

Weasley

said
Ron
Dad
why
was
everyone
uptight
about
that
skull
thing
explain
everything
back
the
tent
said
Weasley
tensely
But
when
they
reached
the
edge
the
wood
their
progress
was
impeded
large
crowd
frightened
looking
witches
and
wizards
was
congregated
there
and
when
they
saw
Weasley
coming
toward
them
many
them
surged
forward
What
going

Who
conjured
Arthur
not
Him
course

said
Weasley
impatiently

Disapparated
Now

led
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
through
the
crowd
and
back
into
the
campsite
All
was
quiet
now
there
was
sign
the
masked
wizards
though
several
ruined
tents
were
still
smoking
Charlie
head
was
poking
out
the
boys
tent
Dad
what
going
called
through
the
dark
Fred
George
and
Ginny

but

others

said
Weasley
bending
down
and
entering
the
tent
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
entered
after
him
Bill
was
sitting
the
small
kitchen
table
holding
bedsheet
his
arm
which
was
bleeding
profusely
Charlie
had
large
rip
his
shirt
and
Percy
was
sporting
bloody
nose
Fred
George
and
Ginny
looked
unhurt
though
shaken
Did
you
get
them
Dad
said
Bill
sharply
The
person
who
conjured
the
Mark
said
Weasley
found
Barry
Crouch
elf
holding
Harry
wand
but
none
the
wiser
about
who
actually
conured
the
Mark
What
said
Bill
Charlie
and
Percy
together
Harry
wand
said
Fred
Crouch
elf
said
Percy
sounding
thunderstruck
With
some
assistance
from
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
Weasley
explained
what
had
happened
the
woods
When
they
had
finished
their
story
Percy
swelled
indignantly
Well
Crouch
quite
right
get
rid
elf
like
that
said
Running
away
when
expressly
told
her
not
embarrassing
him
front
the
whole
Ministry
how
would
that
have
looked
she
been
brought
front
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
She
didn
anything
she
was
just
the
wrong
place
the
wrong
time
Hermione
snapped
Percy
who
looked
very
taken
aback
Hermione
had
always
got
fairly
well
with
Percy
better
indeed
than
any
the
others
Hermione
wizard
Crouch
position
can
afford
house
elf
who
going
run
amok
with
wand
said
Percy
pompously
recovering
himself
She
didn
run
amok
shouted
Hermione
She
just
picked
off
the
ground
Look
can
someone
just
explain
what
that
skull
thing
was
said
Ron
impatiently
wasn
hurting
anyone
Why
such
big
deal
told
you
You
Know
Who
symbol
Ron
said
Hermione
before
anyone
else
could
answer
read
about
The
Rise
and
Fall
the
Dark
Arts
And
hasn
been
seen
for
thirteen
years
said
Weasley
quietly
course
people
panicked
was
almost
like
seeing
You
Know
Who
back
again

get
said
Ron
frowning
mean
still
only
shape
the
sky
Ron
You
Know
Who
and
his
followers
sent
the
Dark
Mark
into
the
air
whenever
they
killed
said
Weasley
The
terror
inspired
you
have
idea
you
too
young
Just
picture
coming
home
and
finding
the
Dark
Mark
hovering
over
your
house
and
knowing
what
you
about
find
inside
Weasley
winced
Everyone
worst
fear
the
very
worst
There
was
silence
for
moment
Then
Bill
removing
the
sheet
from
his
arm
check
his
cut
said
Well
didn
help
tonight
whoever
conjured
scared
the
Death
Eaters
away
the
moment
they
saw
They
all
Disapparated
before
got
near
enough
unmask
any
them
caught
the
Robertses
before
they
hit
the
ground
though
They
having
their
memories
modified
right
now
Death
Eaters
said
Harry
What
are
Death
Eaters
what
You
Know
Who
supporters
called
themselves
said
Bill
think
saw
what
left
them
tonight
the
ones
who
managed
keep
themselves
out
Azkaban
anyway
can
prove
was
them
Bill
said
Weasley
Though
probably
was
added
hopelessly
Yeah
bet
was
said
Ron
suddenly
Dad
met
Draco
Malfoy
the
woods
and
good
told
his
dad
was
one
those
nutters
masks
And
all
know
the
Malfoys
were
right
with
You
Know
Who
But
what
were
Voldemort
supporters
Harry
began
Everybody
flinched
like
most
the
wizarding
world
the
Weasleys
always
avoided
saying
Voldemort
name
Sorry
said
Harry
quickly
What
were
You
Know
Who
supporters
levitating
Muggles
mean
what
was
the
point
The
point
said
Weasley
with
hollow
laugh
Harry
that
their
idea
fun
Half
the
Muggle
killings
back
when
You
Know
Who
was
power
were
done
for
fun
suppose
they
had
few
drinks
tonight
and
couldn
resist
reminding
all
that
lots
them
are
still
large
nice
little
reunion
for
them
finished
disgustedly
But
they
were
the
Death
Eaters
why
did
they
Disapparate
when
they
saw
the
Dark
Mark
said
Ron
They
have
been
pleased
see
wouldn
they
Use
your
brains
Ron
said
Bill
they
really
were
Death
Eaters
they
worked
very
hard
keep
out
Azkaban
when
You
Know
Who
lost
power
and
told
all
sorts
lies
about
him
forcing
them
kill
and
torture
people
bet
they
even
more
frightened
than
the
rest
see
him
come
back
They
denied
they
ever
been
involved
with
him
when
lost
his
powers
and
went
back
their
daily
lives
don
reckon
over
pleased
with
them
you
whoever
conjured
the
Dark
Mark
said
Hermione
slowly
were
they
doing
show
support
for
the
Death
Eaters
scare
them
away
Your
guess
good
ours
Hermione
said
Weasley
But
tell
you
this
was
only
the
Death
Eaters
who
ever
knew
how
conjure
very
surprised
the
person
who
did
hadn
been
Death
Eater
once
even
they
not
now
Listen
very
late
and
your
mother
hears
what
happened
she
worried
sick
get
few
more
hours
sleep
and
then
try
and
get
early
Portkey
out
here
Harry
got
back
into
his
bunk
with
his
head
buzzing
knew
ought
feel
exhausted
was
nearly
three
the
morning
but
felt
wide
awake
wide
awake
and
worried
Three
days
ago
felt
like
much
longer
but
had
only
been
three
days

awoken
with
his
scar
burning
And
tonight
for
the
first
time
thirteen
years
Lord
Voldemort
mark
had
appeared

sky
What
did
these
things
mean
thought
the
letter
had
written
Sirius
before
leaving
Privet
Drive
Would
Sirius
have
gotten
yet
When
would
reply
Harry
lay
looking
the
canvas
but
flying
fantasies
came
him
now
ease
him
sleep
and
was
long
time
after
Charlie
snores
filled
the
tent
that
Harry
finally
dozed
off
CHAPTER

MAYHEM
THE
MINISTRY
Weasley
woke
them
after
only
few
hours
sleep
used
magic
pack
the
tents
and
they
left
the
campsite
quickly
possible
passing
Roberts
the
door
his
cottage
Roberts
had
strange
dazed
look
about
him
and
waved
them
off
with
vague
Merry
Christmas
all
right
said
Weasley
quietly
they
marched
off
onto
the
moor
Sometimes
when
person
memory
modified
makes
him
bit
disorientated
for
while
and
that
was
big
thing
they
had
make
him
forget
They
heard
urgent
voices
they
approached
the
spot
where
the
Portkeys
lay
and
when
they
reached
they
found
great
number
witches
and
wizards
gathered
around
Basil
the
keeper
the
Portkeys
all
clamoring
get
away
from
the
campsite
quickly
possible
Weasley
had
hurried
discussion
with
Basil
they
joined
the
queue
and
were
able
take
old
rubber
tire
back
Stoatshead
Hill
before
the
sun
had
really
risen
They
walked
back
through
Ottery
Catchpole
and
the
damp
lane
toward
the
Burrow
the
dawn
light
talking
very
little
because
they
were
exhausted
and
thinking
longingly
their
breakfast
they
rounded
the
corner
and
the
Burrow
came
into
view
cry
echoed
along
the
lane
thank
goodness

Mrs
Weasley
who
had
evidently
been
waiting
for
them
the

Looking

muttered
distractedly
releasing
Weasley
and
staring
around
them
all
with
red
eyes
you

And
everybody
surprise
she
seized
Fred
and
George
and
pulled
them
both
into
such
tight
hug
that
their
heads
banged
together
Ouch

you
before

Mrs

Fred

toward
the

When

said
Ron
once
Hermione
Yes

quickly
and
the
three

marched
out

and
the

Harry
said
Ron
the
moment

There

Harry
said
Saturday
morning

with
scar
hurting
again
Ron
and
Hermione
reactions
were
almost
exactly
Harry
had
imagined
them
back
his
bedroom
Privet
Drive
Hermione
gasped
and
started
making
suggestions
once
mentioning
number
reference
books
and
everybody
from
Albus
Dumbledore
Madam
Pomfrey
the
Hogwarts
nurse
Ron
simply
looked
dumbstruck
But

they
were
plotting

teetered
for
moment
the
verge
saying
but
couldn
bring
himself
make
Hermione
look
any
more
horrified
than
she
already
did
was
only
dream

Ron
bracingly
Just

Yeah

said
Harry
turning
look
out
the
window
the
brightening
sky
weird
isn

three

later
the
Death
Eaters

and
Voldemort
sign
the
sky
again
Don

Ron
hissed
through
gritted
teeth
And
remember
what
Professor
Trelawney
said
Harry
went
ignoring
Ron
the
end
last
year
Professor
Trelawney
was
their
Divination
teacher
Hogwarts
Hermione
terrified
look
vanished
she
let
out
derisive
snort
Harry

You

said
Harry
You
didn
hear
her
This

into
trance
real
one
And
she
said
the
Dark
Lord
would
rise
again
greater
and
more
terrible
than
ever
before
and
manage
because
his
servant
was
going
back
him
and
that
night
Wormtail
escaped
There
was
silence
which
Ron
fidgeted
absentmindedly
with
hole
his
Chudley
Cannons
bedspread
Why
were
you
asking
Hedwig
had
come
Harry
Hermione
asked
Are

like
Boys

golden
hands
and
each

There

wretched
Skeeter

said
Mrs

flaring
once
Dad

Hermione
angrily

Harry
repacked

his
Firebolt
over
his
shoulder
and
went

Ron
The

the

accompanied
loud
whistlings
and
moans
from
the
wind
not

sporadic
howls
from
the

Pigwidgeon
began
twittering

blank
look
Half
the
cells
Azkaban
are
full
because
him
made
himself
loads
enemies
though
the
families
people
caught
mainly
and
heard
been
getting
really
paranoid
his
old
age
Doesn
trust
anyone
anymore
Sees
Dark
wizards
everywhere
Bill
and
Charlie
decided
come
and
see
everyone
off
King
Cross
station
but
Percy
apologizing
most
profusely
said
that
really
needed
get
work
just
can
justify
taking
more
time
off
the
moment
told
them
Crouch
really
starting
rely
Yeah
you
know
what
Percy
said
George
seriously
reckon
know
your
name
soon
Mrs
Weasley
had
braved
the
telephone
the
village
post
office
order
three
ordinary
Muggle
taxis
take
them
into
London
Arthur
tried
borrow
Ministry
cars
for
Mrs
Weasley
whispered
Harry
they
stood
the
rain
washed
yard
watching
the
taxi
drivers
heaving
six
heavy
Hogwarts
trunks
into
their
cars
But
there
weren
any
spare
dear
they
don
look
happy
they
Harry
didn
like
tell
Mrs
Weasley
that
Muggle
taxi
drivers
rarely
transported
overexcited
owls
and
Pigwidgeon
was
making
earsplitting
racket
Nor
did
help
that
number
Filibuster
Fabulous
Heat
Wet
Start
Fireworks
went
off
unexpectedly
when
Fred
trunk
sprang
open
causing
the
driver
carrying
yell
with
fright
and
pain
Crookshanks
clawed
his
way
the
man
leg
The
journey
was
uncomfortable
owing
the
fact
that
they
were
jammed
the
back
the
taxis
with
their
trunks
Crookshanks
took
quite
while
recover
from
the
fireworks
and
the
time
they
entered
London
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
all
severely
scratched
They
were
very
relieved
get
out
King
Cross
even
though
the
rain
was
coming
down
harder
than
ever
and
they
got
soaked
carrying
their
trunks
across
the
busy
road
and
into
the
station
Harry
was
used
getting
onto
platform
nine
and
three
quarters
now
was
simple
matter
walking
straight
through
the
apparently
solid
barrier
dividing
platforms
nine
and
ten
The
only
tricky
part
was
doing
this
unobtrusive
way
avoid
attracting
Muggle
attention
They
did
groups
today
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
the
most
conspicuous
since
they
were
accompanied
Pigwidgeon
and
Crookshanks
went
first
they
leaned
casually
against
the
barrier
chatting
unconcernedly
and
slid
sideways
through
and
they
did
platform
nine
and
three
quarters
materialized
front
them
The
Hogwarts
Express
gleaming
scarlet
steam
engine
was
already
there
clouds
steam
billowing
from
through
which
the
many
Hogwarts
students
and
parents
the
platform
appeared
like
dark
ghosts
Pigwidgeon
became
noisier
than
ever
response
the
hooting
many
owls
through
the
mist
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
set
off
find
seats
and
were
soon
stowing
their
luggage
compartment
halfway
along
the
train
They
then
hopped
back
down
onto
the
platform
say
good
bye
Mrs
Weasley
Bill
and
Charlie
might
seeing
you
all
sooner
than
you
think
said
Charlie
grinning
hugged
Ginny
good
bye
Why
said
Fred
keenly
You
see
said
Charlie
Just
don
tell
Percy
mentioned
classified
information
until
such
time
the
Ministry
sees
fit
release
after
all
Yeah
sort
wish
were
back
Hogwarts
this
year
said
Bill
hands
his
pockets
looking
almost
wistfully
the
train
Why
said
George
impatiently
You
going
have
interesting
year
said
Bill
his
eyes
twinkling
might
even
get
time
off
come
and
watch
bit
bit
what
said
Ron
But
that
moment
the
whistle
blew
and
Mrs
Weasley
chivvied
them
toward
the
train
doors
Thanks
for
having
stay
Mrs
Weasley
said
Hermione
they
climbed
board
closed
the
door
and
leaned
out
the
window
talk
her
Yeah
thanks
for
everything
Mrs
Weasley
said
Harry
was
pleasure
dears
said
Mrs
Weasley
invite
you
for
Christmas
but
well
expect
you
all
going
want
stay
Hogwarts
what
with
one
thing
and
another
Mum
said
Ron
irritably
What
you
three
know
that
don
You
find
out
this
evening
expect
said
Mrs
Weasley
smiling
going
very
exciting
mind
you
very
glad
they
changed
the
rules
What
rules
said
Harry
Ron
Fred
and
George
together
sure
Professor
Dumbledore
will
tell
you
Now
behave
won
you
Won
you
Fred
And
you
George
The
pistons
hissed
loudly
and
the
train
began
move
Tell
what
happening
Hogwarts
Fred
bellowed
out
the
window
Mrs
Weasley
Bill
and
Charlie
sped
away
from
them
What
rules
are
they
changing
But
Mrs
Weasley
only
smiled
and
waved
Before
the
train
had
rounded
the
corner
she
Bill
and
Charlie
had
Disapparated
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
went
back
their
compartment
The
thick
rain
splattering
the
windows
made
very
difficult
see
out
them
Ron
undid
his
trunk
pulled
out
his
maroon
dress
robes
and
flung
them
over
Pigwidgeon
cage
muffle
his
hooting
Bagman
wanted
tell
what
happening
Hogwarts
said
grumpily
sitting
down
next
Harry
the
World
Cup
remember
But
own
mother
won
say
Wonder
what
Shh
Hermione
whispered
suddenly
pressing
her
finger
her
lips
and
pointing
toward
the
compartment
next
theirs
Harry
and
Ron
listened
and
heard
familiar
drawling
voice
drifting
through
the
open
door
Father
actually
considered
sending
Durmstrang
rather
than
Hogwarts
you
know
knows
the
headmaster
you
see
Well
you
know
his
opinion
Dumbledore
the
man
such
Mudblood
lover
and
Durmstrang
doesn
admit
that
sort
riffraff
But
Mother
didn
like
the
idea
going
school
far
away
Father
says
Durmstrang
takes
far
more
sensible
line
than
Hogwarts
about
the
Dark
Arts
Durmstrang
students
actually
learn
them
not
just
the
defense
rubbish
Hermione
got
tiptoed
the
compartment
door
and
slid
shut
blocking
out
Malfoy
voice
thinks
Durmstrang
would
have
suited
him
does
she
said
angrily
wish
had
gone
then
wouldn
have
put
with
him
Durmstrang
another
wizarding
school
said
Harry
Yes
said
Hermione
sniffily
and
got
horrible
reputation
According
Appraisal
ofMagical
Education
Europe
puts
lot
emphasis
the
Dark
Arts
think
heard
said
Ron
vaguely
Where
What
country
Well
nobody
knows
they
said
Hermione
raising
her
eyebrows
why
not
said
Harry
There
traditionally
been
lot
rivalry
between
all
the
magic
schools
Durmstrang
and
Beauxbatons
like
conceal
their
whereabouts
nobody
can
steal
their
secrets
said
Hermione
matter
factly
Come
off
said
Ron
starting
laugh
Durmstrang
got
about
the
same
size
Hogwarts
how
are
you
going
hide
great
big
castle
But
Hogwarts
hidden
said
Hermione
surprise
Everyone
knows
that
well
everyone
who
read
Hogwarts
History
anyway
Just
you
then
said
Ron
how
you
hide
place
like
Hogwarts
bewitched
said
Hermione
Muggle
looks
all
they
see
moldering
old
ruin
with
sign
over
the
entrance
saying
DANGER
NOT
ENTER
UNSAFE
Durmstrang
just
look
like
ruin
outsider
too
Maybe
said
Hermione
shrugging
might
have
Muggle
repelling
charms
like
the
World
Cup
stadium
And
keep
foreign
wizards
from
finding
they
have
made
Unplottable
Come
again
Well
you
can
enchant
building
impossible
plot
map
can
you
you
say
said
Harry
But
think
Durmstrang
must
somewhere
the
far
north
said
Hermione
thoughtfully
Somewhere
very
cold
because
they
got
fur
capes
part
their
uniforms
think
the
possibilities
said
Ron
dreamily
would
been
easy
push
Malfoy
off
glacier
and
make
look
like
accident
Shame
his
mother
likes
him
The
rain
became
heavier
and
heavier
the
train
moved
farther
north
The
sky
was
dark
and
the
windows
steamy
that
the
lanterns
were
lit
midday
The
lunch
trolley
came
rattling
along
the
corridor
and
Harry
bought
large
stack
Cauldron
Cakes
for
them
share
Several
their
friends
looked
them
the
afternoon
progressed
including
Seamus
Finnigan
Dean
Thomas
and
Neville
Longbottom
round
faced
extremely
forgetful
boy
who
had
been
brought
his
formidable
witch
grandmother
Seamus
was
still
wearing
his
Ireland
rosette
Some
its
magic
seemed
wearing
off
now
was
still
squeaking
Troy
Mullet
Moran
but
very
feeble
and
exhausted
sort
way
After
half
hour
Hermione
growing
tired
the
endless
Quidditch
talk
buried
herself
once
more
The
Standard
Book
Spells
Grade
and
started
trying
learn
Summoning
Charm
Neville
listened
jealously
the
others
conversation
they
relived
the
Cup
match
Gran
didn
want
said
miserably
Wouldn
buy
tickets
sounded
amazing
though
was
said
Ron
Look
this
Neville
rummaged
his
trunk
the
luggage
rack
and
pulled
out
the
miniature
figure
Viktor
Krum
wow
said
Neville
enviously
Ron
tipped
Krum
onto
his
pudgy
hand
saw
him
right
close
well
said
Ron
were
the
Top
Box
For
the
first
and
last
time
your
life
Weasley
Draco
Malfoy
had
appeared
the
doorway
Behind
him
stood
Crabbe
and
Goyle
his
enormous
thuggish
cronies
both
whom
appeared
have
grown
least
foot
during
the
summer
Evidently
they
had
overheard
the
conversation
through
the
compartment
door
which
Dean
and
Seamus
had
left
ajar
Don
remember
asking
you

Malfoy
said
Harry
coolly
Weasley

Malfoy
pointing
Pigwidgeon
cage
sleeve
Ron
dress
robes
was
dangling
from
swaying
with
the
motion
the
train
the
moldy
lace
cuff
very
obvious
Ron
made
stuff
the
robes
out
sight
but
Malfoy
was
too
quick
for
him
seized
the
sleeve
and
pulled
Look

said
Malfoy
ecstasy
holding
Ron
robes
and
showing
Crabbe
and
Goyle
Weasley
you
weren
thinking
wearing

mean
they
were
very
fashionable
about
eighteen
ninety
Eat

Malfoy
said
Ron
the
same
color
the
dress
robes
snatched
them
back
out
Malfoy
grip
Malfoy
howled
with
derisive
laughter
Crabbe
and
Goyle
guffawed
stupidly
going
enter
Weasley
Going
try
and
bring
bit
glory

family
name
There
money
involved

able
afford

Ron

Malfoy
repeated

will
Potter
You

Malfoy
said
Hermione
testily
over
the
top
The
Standard
Book
Spells
Grade
gleeful
smile
spread
across
Malfoy
pale
face
Don

said
delightedly
You

brother
the
Ministry
and
you
don
even

God

Fudge
But
then
Father

people
the
Ministry
Maybe
your
father
too
junior
know
about
Weasley
yes
they
probably
don
talk
about
important
stuff
front
him
Laughing
once
more
Malfoy
beckoned
Crabbe
and
Goyle
and
the
three
them
disappeared
Ron
got
his
feet
and
slammed
the
sliding
compartment
door
hard
behind
them
that
the
glass
shattered
Ron
said
Hermione
reproachfully
and
she
pulled
out
her
wand
muttered
Reparo
and
the
glass
shards
flew
back
into
single
pane
and
back
into
the
door
Well
making
look
like
knows
everything
and
don
Ron
snarled
Father

top
peopie

said
Hermione
quietly
Don
let
Malfoy
get
you
Ron
Him
Get
said
Ron
picking
one
the
remaining
Cauldron
Cakes
and
squashing
into
pulp
Ron
bad
mood
continued
for
the
rest
the
journey
didn
talk
much
they
changed
into
their
school
robes
and
was
still
glowering
when
the
Hogwarts
Express
slowed
down
last
and
finally
stopped
the
pitch
darkness
Hogsmeade
station
the
train
doors
opened
there
was
rumble
thunder
overhead
Hermione
bundled
Crookshanks
her
cloak
and
Ron
left
his
dress
robes
over
Pigwidgeon
they
left
the
train
heads
bent
and
eyes
narrowed
against
the
downpour
The
rain
was
now
coming
down
thick
and
fast
that
was
though
buckets
ice
cold
water
were
being
emptied
repeatedly
over
their
heads
Hagrid
Harry
yelled
seeing
gigantic
silhouette
the
far
end
the
platform
All
righ
Harry
Hagrid
bellowed
back
waving
See
yeh
the
feast
don
drown
First
years
traditionally
reached
Hogwarts
Castle
sailing
across
the
lake
with
Hagrid
Oooh
wouldn
fancy
crossing
the
lake
this
weather
said
Hermione
fervently
shivering
they
inched
slowly
along
the
dark
platform
with
the
rest
the
crowd
hundred
horseless
carriages
stood
waiting
for
them
outside
the
station
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Neville
climbed
gratefully
into
one
them
the
door
shut
with
snap
and
few
moments
later
with
great
lurch
the
long
procession
carriages
was
rumbling
and
splashing
its
way
the
track
toward
Hogwarts
Castle
CHAPTER
TWELVE
THE
TRIWIZARD
TOURNAMENT
Through
the
gates
flanked
with
statues
winged
boars
and
the
sweeping
drive
the
carriages
trundled
swaying
dangerously
what
was
fast
becoming
gale
Leaning
against
the
window
Harry
could
see
Hogwarts
coming
nearer
its
many
lighted
windows
blurred
and
shimmering
behind
the
thick
curtain
rain
Lightning
flashed
across
the
sky
their
carriage
came
halt
before
the
great
oak
front
doors
which
stood
the
top
flight
stone
steps
People
who
had
occupied
the
carriages
front
were
already
hurrying
the
stone
steps
into
the
castle
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Neville
jumped
down
from
their
carriage
and
dashed
the
steps
too
looking
only
when
they
were
safely
inside
the
cavernous
torch
lit
entrance
hall
with
its
magnificent
marble
staircase
Blimey
said
Ron
shaking
his
head
and
sending
water
everywhere
that
keeps
the
lake
going
overflow
soak
ARRGH
large
red
water
filled
balloon
had
dropped
from
out
the
ceiling
onto
Ron
head
and
exploded
Drenched
and
sputtering
Ron
staggered
sideways
into
Harry
just
second
water
bomb
dropped
narrowly
missing
Hermione
burst
Harry
feet
sending
wave
cold
water
over
his
sneakers
into
his
socks
People
all
around
them
shrieked
and
started
pushing
one
another
their
efforts
get
out
the
line
fire
Harry
looked
and
saw
floating
twenty
feet
above
them
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
little
man
bell
covered
hat
and
orange
bow
tie
his
wide
malicious
face
contorted
with
concentration
took
aim
again
PEEVES
yelled
angry
voice
Peeves
come
down
here
ONCE
Professor
McGonagall
Deputy
Headmistress
and
head
Gryffindor
House
had
come
dashing
out
the
Great
Hall
she
skidded
the
wet
floor
and
grabbed
Hermione
around
the
neck
stop
herself
from
falling
Ouch
sorry
Miss
Granger
That
all
right
Professor
Hermione
gasped
massaging
her
throat
Peeves
get
down
here
NOW
barked
Professor
McGonagall
straightening
her
pointed
hat
and
glaring
upward
through
her
square
rimmed
spectacles
Not
doing
nothing
cackled
Peeves
lobbing
water
bomb
several
fifth
year
girls
who
screamed
and
dived
into
the
Great
Hall
Already
wet
aren
they
Little
squirts
Wheeeeeeeeee
And
aimed
another
bomb
group
second
years
who
had
just
arrived

the
headmaster
shouted
Professor
McGonagall
warning
you
Peeves
Peeves
stuck
out
his
tongue
threw
the
last
his
water
bombs
into
the
air
and
zoomed
off
the
marble
staircase
cackling
insanely
Well
move
along
then
said
Professor
McGonagall
sharply
the
bedraggled
crowd
Into
the
Great
Hall
come
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
slipped
and
slid
across
the
entrance
hall
and
through
the
double
doors
the
right
Ron
muttering
furiously
under
his
breath
pushed
his
sopping
hair
off
his
face
The
Great
Hall
looked
its
usual
splendid
self
decorated
for
the
start
term
feast
Golden
plates
and
goblets
gleamed
the
light
hundreds
and
hundreds
candles
floating
over
the
tables
midair
The
four
long
House
tables
were
packed
with
chattering
students
the
top
the
Hall
the
staff
sat
along
one
side
fifth
table
facing
their
pupils
was
much
warmer
here
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
walked
past
the
Slytherins
the
Ravenclaws
and
the
Hufflepuffs
and
sat
down
with
the
rest
the
Gryffindors
the
far
side
the
Hall
next
Nearly
Headless
Nick
the
Gryffindor
ghost
Pearly
white
and
semitransparent
Nick
was
dressed
tonight
his
usual
doublet
but
with
particularly
large
ruff
which
served
the
dual
purpose
looking
extra
festive
and
insuring
that
his
head
didn
wobble
too
much
his
partially
severed
neck
Good
evening
said
beaming
them
Says
who
said
Harry
taking
off
his
sneakers
and
emptying
them
water
Hope
they
hurry
with
the
Sorting
starving
The
Sorting
the
new
students
into
Houses
took
place
the
start
every
school
year
but
unlucky
combination
circumstances
Harry
hadn
been
present
one
since
his
own
was
quite
looking
forward
Just
then
highly
excited
breathless
voice
called
down
the
table
Hiya
Harry
was
Colin
Creevey
third
year
whom
Harry
was
something
hero
Colin
said
Harry
warily
Harry
guess
what
Guess

Harry
brother
starting
brother
Dennis
good
said
Harry
really
excited
said
Colin
practically
bouncing
and
down
his
seat
just
hope
Gryffindor
Keep
your
fingers
crossed
Harry
yeah
all
right
said
Harry
turned
back
Hermione
Ron
and
Nearly
Headless
Nick
Brothers
and

usually
the
same
Houses
don
they
said
was
judging
the
Weasleys
all

Hermione
Parvati
Patil
twin
Ravenclaw
and
they
identical
You
think
they
together
wouldn
you
Harry
looked
the
staff
table
There
seemed
rather
more
empty
seats
there
than
usual
Hagrid
course
was
still
fighting
his
way
across
the
lake
with
the
first
years
Professor
McGonagall
was
presumably
supervising
the
drying
the
entrance
hall
floor
but
there
was
another
empty
chair
too
and
Harry
couldn
think
who
else
was
missing
Where
the
new
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
said
Hermione
who
was
also
looking
the
teachers
They
had
never
yet
had
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
who
had
lasted
more
than
three
terms
Harry
favorite
far
had
been
Professor
Lupin
who
had
resigned
last
year
looked
and
down
the
staff
table
There
was
definitely
new
face
there
Maybe
they
couldn
get
anyone
said
Hermione
looking
anxious
Harry
scanned
the
table
more
carefully
Tiny
little
Professor
Flitwick
the
Charms
teacher
was
sitting
large
pile
cushions
beside
Professor
Sprout
the
Herbology
teacher
whose
hat
was
askew
over
her
flyaway
gray
hair
She
was
talking
Professor
Sinistra

Astronomy
department
Professor
Sinistra
other
side
was
the
sallow
faced
hook
nosed
greasy
haired
Potions
master
Snape
Harry
least
favorite
person
Hogwarts
Harry
loathing
Snape
was
matched
only
Snape
hatred
him
hatred
which
had
possible
intensified
last
year
when
Harry
had
helped
Sirius
escape
right
under
Snape
overlarge
nose
Snape
and
Sirius
had
been
enemies
since
their
own
school
days
Snape
other
side
was
empty
seat
which
Harry
guessed
was
Professor
McGonagall
Next
and
the
very
center
the
table
sat
Professor
Dumbledore
the
headmaster
his
sweeping
silver
hair
and
beard
shining
the
candlelight
his
magnificent
deep
green
robes
embroidered
with
many
stars
and
moons
The
tips
Dumbledore
long
thin
fingers
were
together
and
was
resting
his
chin
upon
them
staring
the
ceiling
through
his
half
moon
spectacles
though
lost
thought
Harry
glanced
the
ceiling
too
was
enchanted
look
like
the
sky
outside
and
had
never
seen
look
this
stormy
Black
and
purple
clouds
were
swirling
across
and
another
thunderclap
sounded
outside
fork
lightning
flashed
across
hurry
Ron
moaned
beside
Harry
could
eat
hippogriff
The
words
were
sooner
out
his
mouth
than
the
doors
the
Great
Hall
opened
and
silence
fell
Professor
McGonagall
was
leading
long
line
first
years
the
top
the
Hall
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
wet
was
nothing
how
these
first
years
looked
They
appeared
have
swum
across
the
lake
rather
than
sailed
All
them
were
shivering
with
combination
cold
and
nerves
they
filed
along
the
staff
table
and
came
halt
line
facing
the
rest
the
school
all
them
except
the
smallest
the
lot
boy
with
mousy
hair
who
was
wrapped
what
Harry
recognized
Hagrid
moleskin
overcoat
The
coat
was
big
for
him
that
hooked
though
were
draped
furry
black
circus
tent
His
small
face
protruded
from
over
the
collar
looking
almost
painfully
excited
When

lined
with
his
terrified
looking
peers
caught
Colin
Creevey

gave
double
thumbs
and

fell
the

looked
positively
delighted
about
Professor
McGonagall
now
placed
three
legged
stool
the
ground
before
the
first
years
and
top
extremely
old
dirty
patched
wizard
hat
The
first
years
stared
did
everyone
else
For
moment
there
was
silence
Then
long
tear
near
the
brim
opened
wide
like
mouth
and
the
hat
broke
into
song
thousand
years
more
ago
When
was
newly
sewn
There
lived
four
wizards
renown
Whose
names
are
still
well
known
Bold
Gryffindor
from
wild
moor
Fair
Ravenclaw
from
glen
Sweet
Hufflepuff
from
valley
broad
Shrewd
Slytherin
from
fin
They
shared
wish
hope
dream
They
hatched
daring
plan
educate
young
sorcerers
Thus
Hogwarts
School
began
Now
each
these
four
founders
Formed
their
own
house
for
each
Did
value
different
virtues
the
ones
they
had
teach
Gryffindor
the
bravest
were
Prized
far
beyond
the
rest
For
Ravenclaw
the
cleverest
Would
always
the
best
For
Hufflepuff
hard
workers
were
Most
worthy
admission
And
power
hungry
Slytherin
Loved
those
great
ambition
While
still
alive
they
did
divide
Their
favorites
from
the
throng
Yet
how
pick
the
worthy
ones
When
they
were
dead
and
gone
Twas
Gryffindor
who
found
the
way
whipped
off
his
head
The
founders
put
some
brains
could
choose
instead
Now
slip
snug
about
your
ears
never
yet
been
wrong
have
look
inside
your
mind
And
tell
where
you
belong
The
Great
Hall
rang
with
applause
the
Sorting
Hat
finished
That
not
the
song
sang
when
Sorted
said
Harry
clapping
along
with
everyone
else

Ron

Professor

For

Harry

strange

The

the
other
side
the
hall
erupted
with
cheers
Harry
could
see

Baddock

Harry
wondered
whether

About

About

Ron
seizing
his

and

and
looking
expectantly
his

Professor
Dumbledore

Tuck

Harry
and
Ron
loudly
the
empty

magically
before
their

Nearly

watched
mournfully
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
loaded
their

Aaah
said
Ron
with
his
mouth
full
mashed

You
lucky

Nearly

There

Why

Harry
through

Peeves

said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
shaking
his
head
which
wobbled
dangerously
pulled
his
ruff
little
higher
his
neck
The
usual
argument
you
know
wanted

the
feast
well
quite
out
the
question
you
know
what
like
utterly
uncivilized
can
see

without
throwing

council
the
Fat
Friar
was
all
for
giving
him
the
chance
but
most
wisely
opinion
the
Bloody
Baron
put
his
foot
down
The
Bloody
Baron
was
the
Slytherin
ghost
gaunt
and
silent
specter
covered
silver
bloodstains
was
the
only
person
Hogwarts
who
could
really
control
Peeves
Yeah
thought
Peeves
seemed
hacked
off
about
something
said
Ron
darkly
what
did
the

the
usual
said
Nearly

Wreaked
havoc

Pots

Terrified

There

Nearly

Here

Nearly

looking
surprised
her
reaction
The

Over

said
Hermione
Well

hardly
ever

him
But

she
said
They

they
And
and
sick
leave
and
pensions
and
everything
Nearly
Headless
Nick
chortled
much
that
his
ruff
slipped
and
his
head
flopped
off
dangling
the
inch
ghostly
skin
and

that
still
attached

Sick

Hermione
looked
down

hardly
touched
plate

then
put
her
knife
and
fork
down
upon
and
pushed
away
from
her
mon

Ron
accidentally
spraying
Harry
with

Yorkshire
pudding
Oops
sorry
Arry
swallowed
You
won
get

sick
leave
starving
yourself
Slave
labor
said
Hermione
breathing
hard
through
her
nose
That
what
made
this
dinner
Slave
labor
And
she
refused
eat
another
bite
The
rain
was
still
drumming
heavily
against
the
high
dark
glass
Another
clap
thunder
shook
the
windows
and
the
stormy
ceiling
flashed
illuminating
the
golden
plates
the
remains
the
first
course
vanished
and
were
replaced
instantly
with
puddings
Treacle

Hermione
said
Ron
deliberately
wafting
its
smell
toward
her
Spotted
dick

Chocolate
gateau
But
Hermione
gave
him
look
reminiscent
Professor
McGonagall
that
gave
When
the
puddings
too
had
been
demolished
and
the
last
crumbs
had
faded
off
the
plates
leaving
them
sparkling
clean
Albus
Dumbledore
got
his
feet
again
The
buzz
chatter
filling
the
Hall
ceased
almost
once
that
only
the
howling
wind
and
pounding
rain
could
heard
said
Dumbledore
smiling
around
them
all
Now
that
are
all
fed
and

Hmph
said
Hermione
must
once
more
ask
for
your
attention
while
give
out
few
notices

that
the
Inter

What
Harry
gasped
looked
around
Fred
and
George
his
fellow
members
the
Quidditch
team
They
were
mouthing
soundlessly
Dumbledore
apparently
too
appalled
speak
Dumbhedore
went
This
due
event
that
will
starting
October
and
continuing
throughout
the
school
year
taking
much
the
teachers
time
and
energy
but
sure
you
will
all
enjoy
immensely
have
great
pleasure
announcing
that
this
year
Hogwarts
But
that
moment
there
was
deafening
rumble
thunder
and
the
doors
the
Great
Hall
banged
open
man
stood
the
doorway
leaning
upon
long
staff
shrouded
black
traveling
cloak
Every
head
the
Great
Hall
swiveled
toward
the
stranger
suddenly
brightly
illuminated
fork
lightning
that
flashed
across
the
ceiling
lowered
his
hood
shook
out
long
mane
grizzled
dark
gray
hair
then
began
walk
toward
the
teachers
table
dull
clunk
echoed
through
the
Hall
his
every
other
step
reached
the
end
the
top
table
turned
right
and
limped
heavily
toward
Dumbledore
Another
flash
lightning
crossed
the
ceiling
Hermione
gasped
The
lightning
had
thrown
the
man
face
into
sharp
relief
and
was
face
unlike
any
Harry
had
ever
seen
looked
though
had
been
carved
out
weathered
wood
someone
who
had
only
the
vaguest
idea
what
human
faces
are
supposed
look
like
and
was
none
too
skilled
with
chisel
Every
inch
skin
seemed
scarred
The
mouth
looked
like
diagonal
gash
and
large
chunk
the
nose
was
missing
But
was
the
man
eyes
that
made
him
frightening
One
them
was
small
dark
and
beady
The
other
was
large
round
coin
and
vivid
electric
blue
The
blue
eye
was
moving
ceaselessly
without
blinking
and
was
rolling
down
and
from
side
side
quite
independently
the
normal
eye
and
then
rolled
right
over
pointing
into
the
back
the
man
head
that
all
they
could
see
was
whiteness
The
stranger
reached
Dumbledore
stretched
out
hand
that
was
badly
scarred
his
face
and
Dumbhedore
shook
muttering
words
Harry
couldn
hear
seemed
making
some
inquiry
the
stranger
who
shook
his
head
unsmilingly
and
replied
undertone
Dumbledore
nodded
and
gestured
the
man
the
empty
seat
his
right
hand
side
The
stranger
sat
down
shook
his
mane
dark
gray
hair
out
his
face
pulled
plate
sausages
toward
him
raised
what
was
left
his
nose
and
sniffed
then
took
small
knife
out
his
pocket
speared
sausage
the
end
and
began
eat
His
normal
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
sausages
but
the
blue
eye
was
still
darting
restlessly
around
its
socket
taking
the
Hall
and
the
students
May
introduce
our
new
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
said
Dumbledore
brightly
into
the
silence
Professor
Moody
was
usual
for
new
staff
members
greeted
with
applause
but
none
the
staff
students
chapped
except
Dumbledore
and
Hagrid
who
both
put
their
hands
together
and
applauded
but
the
sound
echoed
dismally
into
the
silence
and
they
stopped
fairly
quickly
Everyone
else
seemed
too
transfixed
Moody
bizarre
appearance
more
than
stare
him
Moody
Harry
muttered
Ron
Mad

The

Ron
low
awed
voice
What
happened
him
Hermione
whispered
What
happened
his
face
Dunno
Ron
whispered
back
watching
Moody
with
fascination
Moody
seemed
totally
indifferent
his
less
than
warm
welcome
Ignoring
the
jug
pumpkin
juice
front
him
reached
again
into
his
traveling
cloak
pulled
out
hip
flask
and
took
long
draught
from
lifted
his
arm
drink
his
cloak
was
pulled
few
inches
from
the
ground
and
Harry
saw
below
the
table
several
inches
carved
wooden
leg
ending
clawed
foot
Dumbledore
cleared
his
throat

said
Fred
Weasley
loudly
The
tension
that
had
filled
the
Hall
ever
since
Moody
arrival
suddenly
broke
Nearly
everyone
laughed
and
Dumbledore
chuckled
appreciatively
not
joking
Weasley
said
though
now
that
you
mention
did
hear
excellent
one
over
the
summer
about
troll
hag
and
leprechaun

Professor
McGonagall
cleared
her
throat
loudly
but

this
not
the
time
said
Dumbledore
where

Triwizard
Tournament

explanation
and
allow
their
attention
wander
freely
The
Triwizard
Tournament
was
first
established
some
seven
hundred
years
ago
friendly
competition
between
the
three
largest
European
schools
wizardry
Hogwarts
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
champion
was
selected
represent
each
school
and
the
three
champions
competed
three
magical
tasks
The
schools
took
turns
host
the
tournament
once
every
five
years
and
was
generally
agreed
most
excellent
way
establishing
ties
between
young
witches
and
wizards
different
nationalities
until
that
the
death
toll
mounted
high
that
the
tournament
was
discontinued
Death
toll
Hermione
whispered
looking
alarmed
But
her
anxiety
did
not
seem
shared
the
majority
students
the
Hall
many
them
were
whispering
excitedly
one
another
and
Harry
himself
was
far
more
interested
hearing
about
the
tournament
than
worrying
about
deaths
that
had
happened
hundreds
years
ago
There
have
been
several
attempts
over
the
centuries
reinstate
the
tournament
Dumbledore
continued
none
which
has
been
very
successful
However
our
own
departments
International
Magical
Cooperation
and
Magical
Games
and
Sports
have
decided
the
time
ripe
for
another
attempt
have
worked
hard
over
the
summer
ensure
that
this
time
champion
will
find
himself
herself
mortal
danger
The
heads
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
will
arriving
with
their
short
listed
contenders
October
and
the
selection
the
three
champions
will
take
place
Halloween
impartial
judge
will
decide
which
students
are
most
worthy
compete
for
the
Triwizard
Cup
the
glory
their
school
and
thousand
Galleons
personal
prize
money
going
for
Fred
Weasley
hissed
down
the
table
his
face
lit
with
enthusiasm
the
prospect
such
glory
and
riches
was
not
the
only
person
who
seemed
visualizing
himself
the
Hogwarts
champion
every
House
table
Harry
could
see
people
either
gazing
raptly
Dumbledore
else
whispering
fervently
their
neighbors
But
then
Dumbledore
spoke
again
and
the
Hall
quieted
once
more
Eager
though
know
all
you
will
bring
the
Triwizard
Cup
Hogwarts
said
the
heads
the
participating
schools
along
with
the
Ministry
Magic
have
agreed
impose
age
restriction
contenders
this
year
Only
students
who
are
age
that
say
seventeen
years
older
will
allowed
put
forward
their
names
for
consideration
This
Dumbledore
raised
his
voice
slightly
for
several
people
had
made
noises
outrage
these
words
and
the
Weasley
twins
were
suddenly
looking
furious
measure
feel
necessary
given
that
the
tournament
tasks
will
still
difficult
and
dangerous
whatever
precautions
take
and
highly
unlikely
that
students
below
sixth
and
seventh
year
will
able
cope
with
them
will
personally
ensuring
that
underage
student
hoodwinks
our
impartial
judge
into
making
them
Hog
warts
champion
His
light
blue
eyes
twinkled
they
flickered
over
Fred
and
George
mutinous
faces
therefore
beg
you
not
waste
your
time
submitting
yourself
you
are
under
seventeen
The
delegations
from
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
will

the
greater
part
this
year

Mad

Moody
There
was
great
scraping
and
banging
all
the
students
got
their
feet
and
swarmed
toward
the
double
doors
into
the
entrance
hall
They
can

said
George
Weasley
who
had
not
joined
the
crowd
moving
toward
the
door
but
was
standing
and
glaring
Dumbledore

April

They
not
stopping

Fred
stubbornly

top
table

Harry
Ron
Hermione
Fred
and
George
set
off
for
the
entrance
hall
Fred
and
George
debating
the
ways
which
Dumbledore
might
stop
those
who
were
under
seventeen
from
entering
the
tournament
Who

Ron

and
never

how

Dumbledore
trying

People

though
said
Hermione
worried
voice
they
walked
through
door
concealed
behind
tapestry
and
started
another
narrower
staircase
Yeah

Fred
airily
but
that

Anyway

Neville

sunk
right
through

halfway
the
staircase
There
were
many
these
trick
stairs
Hogwarts
was
second
nature
most
the
older
students
jump
this
particular
step
but
Neville
memory
was
notoriously
poor
Harry
and
Ron
seized
him
under
the
armpits
and
pulled
him
out
while
suit
armor
the
top
the
stairs
creaked
and
clanked
laughing
wheezily
Shut

said
Ron
banging
down
its
visor
they
passed
They
made
their
way
the
entrance
Gryffindor
Tower
which
was
concealed
behind
large
portrait

George

The

the
wall
through
which
they
all
climbed
crackling
fire
warmed
the
circular
common
room
which
was
full
squashy
armchairs
and
tables
Hermione
cast
the
merrily
dancing
flames
dark
look
and
Harry
distinctly
heard
her
mutter
Slave
labor
before
bidding
them
good
night
and
disappearing
through
the
doorway
the
girls
dormitory
Harry
Ron
and
Neville
climbed
the
last
spiral
staircase
until
they
reached
their
own
dormitory
which
was
situated
the
top
the
tower
Five
four
poster
beds
with
deep
crimson
hangings
stood
against
the
walls
each
with
its
owner
trunk
the
foot
Dean
and
Seamus
were
already
getting
into
bed
Seamus
had
pinned
his
Ireland
rosette
his
headboard
and
Dean
had
tacked
poster
Viktor
Krum
over
his
bedside
table
His
old
poster
the
West
Ham
football
team
was
pinned
right
next
Mental
Ron
sighed
shaking
his
head
the
completely
stationary
soccer
players
Harry
Ron
and
Neville
got
into
their
pajamas
and
into
bed
Someone
house

placed

pans
between
the
sheets

extremely
comfortable

and
listening

for
you

Ron
said
sleepily
through
the
darkness
Fred
and
George

how

tournament

Harry
rolled
over
bed

new
pictures

his
mind

had
hoodwinked
the
impartial
judge
into
believing

Hogwarts
champion

standing
the
grounds
his
arms
raised
triumph
front
the
whole
school
all
whom
were
applauding
and
screaming
had
just
won
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Cho
face
stood
out
particularly
clearly
the
blurred
crowd
her
face
glowing
with
admiration
Harry
grinned
into
his
pillow
exceptionally
glad
that
Ron
couldn
see
what
could
CHAPTER
THIRTEEN
MAD
EYE
MOODY
The
storm
had
blown
itself
out
the
following
morning
though
the
ceiling
the
Great
Hall
was
still
gloomy
heavy
clouds
pewter
gray
swirled
overhead
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
examined
their
new
course
schedules
breakfast
few
seats
along
Fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
were
discussing
magical
methods
aging
themselves
and
bluffing
their
way
into
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Today
not
bad
outside
all
morning
said
Ron
who
was
running
his
finger
down
the
Monday
column
his
schedule
Herbology
with
the
Hufflepuffs
and
Care
Magical
Creatures
damn
still
with
the
Slytherins
Double
Divination
this
afternoon
Harry
groaned
looking
down
Divination
was
his
least
favorite
subject
apart
from
Potions
Professor
Trelawney
kept
predicting
Harry
death
which
found
extremely
annoying
You
should
have
given
like
shouldn
you
said
Hermione
briskly
buttering
herself
some
toast
Then
you
doing
something
sensible
like
Arithmancy
You
eating
again
notice
said
Ron
watching
Hermione
adding
liberal
amounts
jam
her
toast
too
decided
there
are
better
ways
making
stand
about
elf
rights
said
Hermione
haughtily
Yeah
and
you
were
hungry
said
Ron
grinning
There
was
sudden
rustling
noise
above
them
and
hundred
owls
came
soaring
through
the
open
windows
carrying
the
morning
mail
Instinctively
Harry
looked
but
there
was
sign
white
among
the
mass
brown
and
gray
The
owls
circled
the
tables
looking
for
the
people
whom
their
letters
and
packages
were
addressed
large
tawny
owl
soared
down
Neville
Longbottom
and
deposited
parcel
into
his
lap
Neville
almost
always
forgot
pack
something
the
other
side
the
Hall
Draco
Malfoy
eagle
owl
had
landed
his
shoulder
carrying
what
looked
like
his
usual
supply
sweets
and
cakes
from
home
Trying
ignore
the
sinking
feeling
disappointment
his
stomach
Harry
returned
his
porridge
Was
possible
that
something
had
happened
Hedwig
and
that
Sirius
hadn
even
got
his
letter
His
preoccupation
lasted
all
the
way
across
the
sodden
vegetable
patch
until
they
arrived
greenhouse
three
but
here
was
distracted
Professor
Sprout
showing
the
class
the
ugliest
plants
Harry
had
ever
seen
Indeed
they
looked
less
like
plants
than
thick
black
giant
slugs
protruding
vertically
out
the
soil
Each
was
squirming
slightly
and
had
number
large
shiny
swellings
upon
which
appeared
full
liquid
Bubotubers
Professor
Sprout
told
them
briskly
They
need
squeezing
You
will
collect
the
pus
The
what
said
Seamus
Finnigan
sounding
revolted
Pus
Finnigan
pus
said
Professor
Sprout
and
extremely
valuable
don
waste
You
will
collect
the
pus
say
these
bottles
Wear
your
dragon
hide
gloves
can
funny
things
the
skin
when
undiluted
bubotuber
pus
Squeezing
the
bubotubers
was
disgusting
but
oddly
satisfying
each
swelling
was
popped
large
amount
thick
yellowish
green
liquid
burst
forth
which
smelled
strongly
petrol
They
caught
the
bottles
Professor
Sprout
had
indicated
and
the
end
the
lesson
had
collected
several
pints
This
keep
Madam
Pomfrey
happy
said
Professor
Sprout
stoppering
the
last
bottle
with
cork
excellent
remedy
for
the
more
stubborn
forms
acne
bubotuber
pus
Should
stop
students
resorting
desperate
measures
rid
themselves
pimples
Like
poor
Eloise
Midgen
said
Hannah
Abbott
Hufflepuff
hushed
voice
She
tried
curse
hers
off
Silly
girl
said
Professor
Sprout
shaking
her
head
But
Madam
Pomfrey
fixed
her
nose
back
the
end
booming
bell
echoed
from
the
castle
across
the
wet
grounds
signaling
the
end
the
lesson
and
the
class
separated
the
Hufflepuffs
climbing
the
stone
steps
for
Transfiguration
and
the
Gryffindors
heading
the
other
direction
down
the
sloping
lawn
toward
Hagrid
small
wooden
cabin
which
stood
the
edge
the
Forbidden
Forest
Hagrid
was
standing
outside
his
hut
one
hand
the
collar
his
enormous
black
boarhound
Fang
There
were
several
open
wooden
crates
the
ground
his
feet
and
Fang
was
whimpering
and
straining
his
collar
apparently
keen
investigate
the
contents
more
closely
they
drew
nearer
odd
rattling
noise
reached
their
ears
punctuated
what
sounded
like
minor
explosions
Mornin
Hagrid
said
grinning
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
wait
fer
the
Slytherins
they
won

Blast

Skrewts
Come

said
Ron
Hagrid
pointed
down
into
the
crates
Eurgh
squealed
Lavender
Brown
jumping
backward
Eurgh
just
about
summed
the
Blast
Ended
Skrewts
Harry
opinion
They
looked
like
deformed
shell
less
lobsters
horribly
pale
and
slimy
looking
with
legs
sticking
out
very
odd
places
and
visible
heads
There
were
about
hundred
them
each
crate
each
about
six
inches
long
crawling
over
one
another
bumping
blindly
into
the
sides
the
boxes
They
were
giving
off
very
powerful
smell
rotting
fish
Every
now
and
then
sparks
would
fly
out
the
end
skrewt
and
with
small
phut
would
propelled
forward
several
inches
jus

said
Hagrid
proudly

Thought
make
bit
project
And
why
would
want
raise
them
said
cold
voice
The
Slytherins
had
arrived
The
speaker
was
Draco
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
chuckling
appreciatively
his
words
Hagrid
looked
stumped
the
question
mean
what
they
asked
Malfoy
What
the
point
them
Hagrid
opened
his
mouth
apparently
thinking
hard
there
was
few
seconds
pause
then
said
roughly
Tha
next
lesson
Malfoy
Yer

First

muttered
Seamus
Nothing
but
deep
affection
for
Hagrid
could
have
made
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
pick
squelchy
handfuls
frog
liver
and
lower
them
into
the
crates
tempt
the
Blast
Ended
Skrewts
Harry
couldn
suppress
the
suspicion
that
the
whole
thing
was
entirely
pointless
because
the
skrewts
didn
seem
have
mouths
Ouch
yelled
Dean
Thomas
after
about
ten
minutes
got
Hagrid
hurried
over
him
looking
anxious
Its
end
exploded
said
Dean
angrily
showing
Hagrid
burn
his
hand
yeah

when

said
Hagrid
nodding
Eurgh
said
Lavender
Brown
again
Eurgh
Hagrid
what
that
pointy
thing

said
Hagrid
enthusiastically
Lavender
quickly
withdrew
her
hand
from
the
box
reckon
they
the
males
The
females
got
sorta
sucker
things
their
bellies
think
they
might
ter
suck
blood
Well
can
certainly
see
why
trying
keep
them
alive
said
Malfoy
sarcastically
Who
wouldn
want
pets
that
can
burn
sting
and
bite
all
once
Just
because
they
not
very
pretty
doesn
mean
they
not
useful
Hermione
snapped
Dragon
blood
amazingly
magical
but
you
wouldn
want
dragon
for
pet
would
you
Harry
and
Ron
grinned
Hagrid
who
gave
them
furtive
smile
from
behind
his
bushy
beard
Hagrid
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
pet
dragon
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
knew
only
too
well
had
owned
one
for
brief
period
during
their
first
year
vicious
Norwegian
Ridgeback
the
name
Norbert
Hagrid
simply
loved
monstrous
creatures
the
more
lethal
the
better
Well
least
the
skrewts
are
small
said
Ron
they
made
their
way
back
the
castle
for
lunch
hour
later
They
are
now
said
Hermione
exasperated
voice
but
once
Hagrid
found
out
what
they
eat
expect
they
six
feet
long
Well
that
won
matter
they
turn
out
cure
seasickness
something

said
Ron
grinning
slyly
her
You
know
perfectly
well
only
said
that
shut
Malfoy
said
Hermione
matter
fact
think
right
The
best
thing
would
stamp
the
lot
them
before
they
start
attacking
all
They
sat
down
the
Gryffindor
table
and
helped
themselves
lamb
chops
and
potatoes
Hermione
began
eat
fast
that
Harry
and
Ron
stared
her
this
the
new
stand
elf
rights
said
Ron
You
going
make
yourself
puke
instead
said
Hermione
with
much
dignity
she
could
muster
with
her
mouth
bulging
with
sprouts
just
want
get
the
library
What
said
Ron
disbelief
Hermione
the
first
day
back
haven
even
got
homework
yet
Hermione
shrugged
and
continued
shovel
down
her
food
though
she
had
not
eaten
for
days
Then
she
leapt
her
feet
said
See
you
dinner
and
departed
high
speed
When
the
bell
rang
signal
the
start
afternoon
lessons
Harry
and
Ron
set
off
for
North
Tower
where
the
top
tightly
spiraling
staircase
silver
stepladder
led
circular
trapdoor
the
ceiling
and
the
room
where
Professor
Trelawney
lived
The
familiar
sweet
perfume
spreading
from
the
fire
met
their
nostrils
they
emerged
the
top
the
stepladder
ever
the
curtains
were
all
closed
the
circular
room
was
bathed
dim
reddish
light
cast
the
many
lamps
which
were
all
draped
with
scarves
and
shawls
Harry
and
Ron
walked
through
the
mass
occupied
chintz
chairs
and
poufs
that
cluttered
the
room
and
sat
down
the
same
small
circular
table
Good
day
said
the
misty
voice
Professor
Trelawney
right
behind
Harry
making
him
jump
very
thin
woman
with
enormous
glasses
that
made
her
eyes
appear
far
too
large
for
her
face
Professor
Trelawney
was
peering
down
Harry
with
the
tragic
expression
she
always
wore
whenever
she
saw
him
The
usual
large
amount
beads
chains
and
bangles
glittered
upon
her
person
the
firelight
You
are
preoccupied
dear
she
said
mournfully
Harry
inner
eye
sees
past
your
brave
face
the
troubled
soul
within
And
regret
say
that
your
worries
are
not
baseless
see
difficult
times
ahead
for
you
alas
most
difficult
fear
the
thing
you
dread
will
indeed
come
pass
and
perhaps
sooner
than
you
think
Her
voice
dropped
almost
whisper
Ron
rolled
his
eyes
Harry
who
looked
stonily
back
Professor
Trelawney
swept
past
them
and
seated
herself
large
winged
armchair
before
the
fire
facing
the
class
Lavender
Brown
and
Parvati
Patil
who
deeply
admired
Professor
Trelawney
were
sitting
poufs
very
close
her
dears
time
for
consider
the
stars
she
said
The
movements
the
planets
and
the
mysterious
portents
they
reveal
only
those
who
understand
the
steps
the
celestial
dance
Human
destiny
may
deciphered
the
planetary
rays
which
intermingle
But
Harry
thoughts
had
drifted
The
perfumed
fire
always
made
him
feel
sleepy
and
dull
witted
and
Professor
Trelawney
rambling
talks
fortune
telling
never
held
him
exactly
spellbound
though
couldn
help
thinking
about
what
she
had
just
said
him
fear
the
thing
you
dread
will
indeed
come
pass
But
Hermione
was
right
Harry
thought
irritably
Professor
Trelawney
really
was
old
fraud
wasn
dreading
anything
the
moment
all
well
unless
you
counted
his
fears
that
Sirius
had
been
caught
but
what
did
Professor
Trelawney
know
had
long
since
come
the
conclusion
that
her
brand
fortunetelling
was
really
more
than
lucky
guesswork
and
spooky
manner
Except
course
for
that
time
the
end
last
term
when
she
had
made
the
prediction
about
Voldemort
rising
again
and
Dumbledore
himself
had
said
that
thought
that
trance
had
been
genuine
when
Harry
had
described
him
Harry
Ron
muttered
What
Harry
looked
around
the
whole
class
was
staring
him
sat
straight
had
been
almost
dozing
off
lost
the
heat
and
his
thoughts
was
saying
dear
that
you
were
clearly
born
under
the
baleful
influence
Saturn
said
Professor
Trelawney
faint
note
resentment
her
voice
the
fact
that
had
obviously
not
been
hanging
her
words
Born
under
what
sorry
said
Harry
Saturn
dear
the
planet
Saturn
said
Professor
Trelawney
sounding
definitely
irritated
that
wasn
riveted
this
news
was
saying
that
Saturn
was
surely
position
power
the
heavens
the
moment
your
birth
Your
dark

your
mean
stature
tragic
losses

life
think
right
saying
dear
that
you
were

said
Harry
was
born
July
Ron
hastily
turned
his
laugh
into
hacking
cough
Half
hour
later
each
them
had
been
given
complicated
circular
chart
and
was
attempting
fill
the
position

planets
their
moment

dull

requiring

Harry
after
while
frowning
down
his
piece

that

Ron

when

Harry

Oooh

said
Professor
Trelawney
peering
down
the
chart
Can

look
Uranus

Lavender
said
Ron
Most
unfortunately
Professor
Trelawney
heard
him
and
was
this
perhaps
that
made
her
give
them
much
homework
the
end
the
class
detailed
analysis
the
way
the
planetary
movements
the
coming
month

like

McGonagall
than
her
usual
airy
fairy

Monday
and
excuses
Miserable

said
Ron
bitterly
they
joined
the
crowds
descending
the
staircases
back
the
Great
Hall
and
dinner
That

Lots

said
Hermione
brightly
catching
with
them
Professor
Vector
didn
give
any
all
Well

for
Professor
Vector
said
Ron
moodily
They
reached
the
entrance
hall
which
was
packed
with
people
queuing
for
dinner
They
had
just
joined
the
end
the
line
when
loud
voice
rang
out
behind
them
Weasley
Hey

Ron

Hermione

Crabbe

Imagine

Everyone
the

was

now
Malfoy
straightened
the
paper
with
flourish
and
read
Arnold
Weasley

Moody
the
aged
Auror
who
retired
from

Ministry
when
longer
able
tell
the
difference
between

Unsurprisingly
Weasley
found
upon

Moody
heavily
guarded
house
that
Moody
had
once
again
raised
false
alarm
Weasley
was
forced
modify
several

Harry

and

from

Malfoy
that

she
got

Malfoy
pale

went
slightly
pink
Don

insult

Potter
Keep
your

shut
then
said
Harry
turning
away
BANG
Several
people
screamed
Harry
felt
something
white
hot
graze
the
side
his
face
plunged
his
hand
into
his
robes
for
his
wand
but
before
even
touched
heard
second
loud
BANG
and
roar
that
echoed
through
the
entrance
hall
YOU
DON
LADDIE
Harry
spun
around
Professor
Moody
was
limping
down
the
marble
staircase
His
wand
was
out
and
was
pointing
right
pure
white
ferret
which
was
shivering
the
stone
flagged
floor
exactly
where
Malfoy
had
been
standing
There
was
terrified
silence
the
entrance
hall
Nobody
but
Moody
was
moving
muscle
Moody
turned
look
Harry
least
his
normal
eye
was
looking
Harry
the
other
one
was
pointing
into
the
back
his
head
Did
get
you
Moody
growled
His
voice
was
low
and
gravelly
said
Harry
missed
LEAVE
Moody
shouted
Leave
what
Harry
said
bewildered
Not
you
him
Moody
growled
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
Crabbe
who
had
just
frozen
about
pick
the
white
ferret
seemed
that
Moody
rolling
eye
was
magical
and
could
see
out
the
back
his
head
Moody
started
limp
toward
Crabbe
Goyle
and
the
ferret
which
gave
terrified
squeak
and
took
off
streaking
toward
the
dungeons
don
think
roared
Moody
pointing
his
wand
the
ferret
again
flew
ten
feet
into
the
air
fell
with
smack
the
floor
and
then
bounced
upward
once
more
don
like
people
who
attack
when
their
opponent
back
turned
growled
Moody
the
ferret
bounced
higher
and
higher
squealing
pain
Stinking
cowardly
scummy
thing
The
ferret
flew
through
the
air
its
legs
and
tail
flailing
helplessly
Never
that
again
said
Moody
speaking
each
word
the
ferret
hit
the
stone
floor
and
bounced
upward
again
Professor
Moody
said
shocked
voice
Professor
McGonagall
was
coming
down
the
marble
staircase
with
her
arms
full
books
Hello
Professor
McGonagall
said
Moody
calmly
bouncing
the
ferret
still
higher
What
what
are
you
doing
said
Professor
McGonagall
her
eyes
following
the
bouncing
ferret
progress
through
the
air
Teaching
said
Moody
Teach
Moody
that
student
shrieked
Professor
McGonagall
the
books
spilling
out
her
arms
Yep
said
Moody
cried
Professor
McGonagall
running
down
the
stairs
and
pulling
out
her
wand
moment
later
with
loud
snapping
noise
Draco
Malfoy
had
reappeared
lying
heap
the
floor
with
his
sleek
blond
hair
all
over
his
now
brilliantly
pink
face
got
his
feet
wincing
Moody
never
use
Transfiguration
punishment
said
Professor
McGonagall
wealdy
Surely
Professor
Dumbledore
told
you
that
might
mentioned
yeah
said
Moody
scratching
his
chin
unconcernedly
but
thought
good
sharp
shock
give
detentions
Moody
speak
the
offender
Head
House
that
then
said
Moody
staring
Malfoy
with
great
dislike
Malfoy
whose
pale
eyes
were
still
watering
with
pain
and
humiliation
looked
malevolently
Moody
and
muttered
something
which
the
words
father
were
distinguishable
yeah
said
Moody
quietly
limping
forward
few
steps
the
dull
clunk
his
wooden
leg
echoing
around
the
hall
Well
know
your
father
old
boy
You
tell
him
Moody
keeping
close
eye
his
son
you
tell
him
that
from
Now

Head
House
Snape

Yes
said
Malfoy
resentfully
Another
old
friend
growled
Moody
been
looking
forward
chat
with
old
Snape
Come
you
And
seized
Malfoy
upper
arm
and
marched
him
off
toward
the
dungeons
Professor
McGonagall
stared
anxiously
after
them
for
few
moments
then
waved
her
wand
her
fallen
books
causing
them
soar
into
the
air
and
back
into
her
arms
Don
talk
Ron
said
quietly
Harry
and
Hermione
they
sat
down
the
Gryffindor
table

minutes

Ron
his
eyes
closed
and
uplifted
expression
his
face
Draco
Malfoy
the
amazing
bouncing
ferret
Harry
and
Hermione
both
laughed
and
Hermione
began
doling
beef
casserole
onto
each
their
plates
could
have
really
hurt
Malfoy
though
she
said
was
good
really
that
Professor
McGonagall
stopped
Hermione
said
Ron
furiously
his
eyes
snapping
open
again

the
best
moment

Hermione
made
impatient
noise
and
began

CHAPTER
FOURTEEN
THE
UNFORGIVABLE
CURSES
The
next
two
days
passed
without
great
incident
unless
you
counted
Neville
melting
his
sixth
cauldron
Potions
Professor
Snape
who
seemed
have
attained
new
levels
vindictiveness
over
the
summer
gave
Nevihle
detention
and
Neville
returned
from
state
nervous
collapse
having
been
made
disembowel
barrel
full
horned
toads
You
know
why
Snape
such
foul
mood
don
you
said
Ron
Harry
they
watched
Hermione
teaching
Neville
Scouring
Charm
remove
the
frog
guts
from
under
his
fingernails
Yeah
said
Harry
Moody
was
common
knowledge
that
Snape
really
wanted
the
Dark
Arts
job
and
had
now
failed
get
for
the
fourth
year
running
Snape
had
disliked
all
their
previous
Dark
Arts
teachers
and
shown
but
seemed
strangely
wary
displaying
overt
animosity
Mad
Eye
Moody
Indeed
whenever
Harry
saw
the
two
them
together
mealtimes
when
they
passed
the
corridors
had
the
distinct
impression
that
Snape
was
avoiding
Moody
eye
whether
magical
normal
reckon
Snape
bit
scared
him
you
know
Harry
said
thoughtfully
Imagine
Moody
turned
Snape
into
horned
toad
said
Ron
his
eyes
misting
over
and
bounced
him
all
around
his
dungeon
The
Gryffindor
fourth
years
were
looking
forward
Moody
first
lesson
much
that
they
arrived
early
Thursday
lunchtime
and
queued
outside
his
classroom
before
the
bell
had
even
rung
The
only
person
missing
was
Hermione
who
turned
just
time
for
the
lesson
Been
the
Library
Harry
finished
her
sentence
for
her
mon
quick
won
get
decent
seats
They
hurried
into
three
chairs
right
front
the
teacher
desk
took
out
their
copies
The
Dark
Forces
Guide
Self
Protection
and
waited
unusually
quiet
Soon
they
heard
Moody
distinctive
clunking
footsteps
coming
down
the
corridor
and
entered
the
room
looking
strange
and
frightening
ever
They
could
just
see
his
clawed
wooden
foot
protruding
from
underneath
his
robes
You
can
put
those
away
growled
stumping
over
his
desk
and
sitting
down
those
books
You
won
need
them
They
returned
the
books
their
bags
Ron
looking
excited
Moody
took
out
register
shook
his
long
mane
grizzled
gray
hair
out
his
twisted
and
scarred
face
and
began
call
out
names
his
normal
eye
moving
steadily
down
the
list
while
his
magical
eye
swiveled
around
fixing
upon
each
student
she
answered
Right
then
said
when
the
last
person
had
declared
themselves
present
had
letter
from
Professor
Lupin
about
this
class
Seems
you
had
pretty
thorough
grounding
tackling
Dark
creatures
you
covered
boggarts
Red
Caps
hinkypunks
grindylows
Kappas
and
werewolves
that
right
There
was
general
murmur
assent
But
you
behind
very
behind
dealing
with
curses
said
Moody
here
bring
you
scratch
what
wizards
can
each
other
got
one
year
teach
you
how
deal
with
Dark
What
aren
you
staying
Ron
blurted
out
Moody
magical
eye
spun
around
stare
Ron
Ron
looked
extremely
apprehensive
but
after
moment
Moody
smiled
the
first
time
Harry
had
seen
him
The
effect
was
make
his
heavily
scarred
face
look
more
twisted
and
contorted
than
ever
but
was
nevertheless
good
know
that
ever
did
anything
friendly
smile
Ron
looked
deeply
relieved
You
Arthur
Weasley
son
Moody
said
Your
father
got
out
very
tight
corner
few
days
ago
Yeah
staying
just
the
one
year
Special
favor
Dumbledore
One
year
and
then
back
quiet
retirement
gave
harsh
laugh
and
then
clapped
his
gnarled
hands
together
straight
into
Curses
They
come
many
strengths
and
forms
Now
according
the
Ministry
Magic
supposed
teach
you
countercurses
and
leave
that
not
supposed
show
you
what
illegal
Dark
curses

like
until
you

sixth
year
You
not
supposed
old
enough

with
till
then
But
Professor
Dumbledore
got
higher
opinion
your
nerves
reckons
you
can
cope
and
say
the
sooner
you
know
what
you
against
the
better
How

supposed

yourself
against
something

never
seen
wizard
who

going
tell
you
what
about

going
nice
and
polite
your
face
You
need
prepared
You
need
alert
and
watchful
You
need
put
that
away
Miss
Brown
when
talking
Lavender
jumped
and
blushed
She
had
been
showing
Parvati
her
completed
horoscope
under
the
desk
Apparently
Moody
magical
eye
could
see
through
solid
wood
well
out
the
back
his
head
any
you
know
which
curses
are
most
heavily
punished
wizarding
law
Several
hands
rose
tentatively
into
the
air
including
Ron
and
Hermione
Moody
pointed
Ron
though
his
magical
eye
was
still
fixed
Lavender
said
Ron
tentatively
dad
told
about
one
called
the
Imperius
Curse
something
yes
said
Moody
appreciatively
Your
father
would
know
that
one
Gave
the
Ministry
lot
trouble
one
time
the
Imperius
Curse
Moody
got
heavily
his
mismatched
feet
opened
his
desk
drawer
and
took
out
glass
jar
Three
large
black
spiders
were
scuttling
around
inside
Harry
felt
Ron
recoil
slightly
next
him
Ron
hated
spiders
Moody
reached
into
the
jar
caught
one
the
spiders
and
held
the
palm
his
hand
that
they
could
all
see
then
pointed
his
wand
and
muttered
Imperio
The
spider
leapt
from
Moody
hand
fine
thread
silk
and
began
swing
backward
and
forward
though
trapeze
stretched
out
its
legs
rigidly
then
did
back
flip
breaking
the
thread
and
landing
the
desk
where
began
cartwheel
circles
Moody
jerked
his
wand
and
the
spider
rose
onto
two
its
hind
legs
and
went
into
what
was
unmistakably
tap
dance
Everyone
was
laughing
everyone
except
Moody
Think
funny
you
growled
You
like
would
you
did
you
The
laughter
died
away
almost
instantly
Total
control
said
Moody
quietly
the
spider
balled
itself
and
began
roll
over
and
over
could
make
jump
out
the
window
drown
itself
throw
itself
down
one
your
throats
Ron
gave
involuntary
shudder
Years
back
there
were
lot
witches
and
wizards
being
controlled
the
Imperius
Curse
said
Moody
and
Harry
knew
was
talking
about
the
days
which
Voldemort
had
been
all
powerful
Some
job
for
the
Ministry
trying
sort
out
who
was
being
forced
act
and
who
was
acting
their
own
free
will
The
Imperius
Curse
can
fought
and
teaching
you
how
but
takes
real
strength
character
and
not
everyone
got
Better
avoid
being
hit
with
you
can
CONSTANT
VIGILANCE
barked
and
everyone
jumped
Moody
picked
the
somersaulting
spider
and
threw
back
into
the
jar
Anyone
else
know
one
Another
illegal
curse
Hermione
hand
flew
into
the
air
again
and
Harry
slight
surprise
did
Neville
The
only
class
which
Neville
usually
volunteered
information
was
Herbology
which
was
easily
his
best
subject
Neville
looked
surprised
his
own
daring
Yes
said
Moody
his
magical
eye
rolling
right
over
fix
Neville
There
one
the
Cruciatus
Curse
said
Neville
small
but
distinct
voice
Moody
was
looking
very
intently
Neville
this
time
with
both
eyes
Your
name
Longbottom
said
his
magical
eye
swooping
down
check
the
register
again
Neville
nodded
nervously
but
Moody
made
further
inquiries
Turning
back
the
class
large
reached
into
the
jar
for
the
next
spider
and
placed
upon
the
desktop
where
remained
motionless
apparently
too
scared
move
The
Cruciatus
Curse
said
Moody
Needs
bit
bigger
for
you
get
the
idea
said
pointing
his
wand
the
spider
Engorgio
The
spider
swelled
was
now
larger
than
tarantula
Abandoning
all
pretense
Ron
pushed
his
chair
backward
far
away
from
Moody
desk
possible
Moody
raised
his
wand
again
pointed
the
spider
and
muttered
Crucio
once
the
spider
legs
bent
upon
its
body
rolled
over
and
began
twitch
horribly
rocking
from
side
side
sound
came
from
but
Harry
was
sure
that
could
have
given
voice
would
have
been
screaming
Moody
did
not
remove
his
wand
and
the
spider
started
shudder
and
jerk
more
violently
Stop
Hermione
said
shrilly
Harry
looked
around
her
She
was
looking
not
the
spider
but
Neville
and
Harry
following
her
gaze
saw
that
Neville
hands
were
clenched
upon
the
desk
front
him
his
knuckles
white
his
eyes
wide
and
horrified
Moody
raised
his
wand
The
spider
legs
relaxed
but
continued
twitch
Reducio
Moody
muttered
and
the
spider
shrank
back
its
proper
size
put
back
into
the
jar
Pain
said
Moody
softly
You
don
need
thumbscrews
knives
torture
someone
you
can
perform
the
Cruciatus
Curse
That
one
was
very
popular
once
too
Right
anyone
know
any
others
Harry
looked
around
From
the
looks
everyone
faces
guessed
they
were
all
wondering
what
was
going
happen
the
last
spider
Hermione
hand
shook
slightly
for
the
third
time
she
raised
into
the
air
Yes
said
Moody
looking
her
Avada
Kedavra
Hermione
whispered
Several
people
looked
uneasily
around
her
including
Ron
said
Moody
another
slight
smile
twisting
his
lopsided
mouth
Yes
the
last
and
worst
Avada
Kedavra
the
Killing
Curse
put
his
hand
into
the
glass
jar
and
almost
though
knew
what
was
coming
the
third
spider
scuttled
frantically
around
the
bottom
the
jar
trying
evade
Moody
fingers
but
trapped
and
placed
upon
the
desktop
started
scuttle
frantically
across
the
wooden
surface
Moody
raised
his
wand
and
Harry
felt
sudden
thrill
foreboding
Avada
Kedavra
Moody
roared
There
was
flash
blinding
green
light
and
rushing
sound
though
vast
invisible
something
was
soaring
through
the
air
instantaneously
the
spider
rolled
over
onto
its
back
unmarked
but
unmistakably
dead
Several
the
students
stifled
cries
Ron
had
thrown
himself
backward
and
almost
toppled
off
his
seat
the
spider
skidded
toward
him
Moody
swept
the
dead
spider
off
the
desk
onto
the
floor
Not
nice
said
calmly
Not
pleasant
And
there
countercurse
There
blocking
Only
one
known
person
has
ever
survived
and
sitting
right
front
Harry
felt
his
face
redden
Moody
eyes
both
them
looked
into
his
own
could
feel
everyone
else
looking
around
him
too
Harry
stared
the
blank
blackboard
though
fascinated
but
not
really
seeing
all
that
was
how
his
parents
had
died
exactly
like
that
spider
Had
they
been
unblemished
and
unmarked
too
Had
they
simply
seen
the
flash
green
light
and
heard
the
rush
speeding
death
before
life
was
wiped
from
their
bodies
Harry
had
been
picturing
his
parents
deaths
over
and
over
again
for
three
years
now
ever
since
found
out
they
had
been
murdered
ever
since
found
out
what
had
happened
that
night
Wormtail
had
betrayed
his
parents
whereabouts
Voldemort
who
had
come
find
them
their
cottage
How
Voldemort
had
killed
Harry
father
first
How
James
Potter
had
tried
hold
him
off
while
shouted
his
wife
take
Harry
and
run
Voldemort
had
advanced
Lily
Potter
told
her
move
aside
that
could
kill
Harry
how
she
had
begged
him
kill
her
instead
refused
stop
shielding
her
son
and
Voldemort
had
murdered
her
too
before
turning
his
wand
Harry
Harry
knew
these
details
because
had
heard
his
parents
voices
when
had
fought
the
dementors
last
year
for
that
was
the
terrible
power
the
dementors
force
their
victims
relive
the
worst
memories
their
lives
and
drown
powerless
their
own
despair
Moody
was
speaking
again
from
great
distance
seemed
Harry
With
massive
effort
pulled
himself
back
the
present
and
listened
what
Moody
was
saying
Avada
Kedavra
curse
that
needs
powerful
bit
magic
behind
you
could
all
get
your
wands
out
now
and
point
them
and
say
the
words
and
doubt
get
much
nosebleed
But
that
doesn
matter
not
here
teach
you
how
Now
there
countercurse
why
showing
you
Because
you
got

You
got

what
the
worst
You
don
want

yourself
situation
where
you
facing
CONSTANT
VIGILANCE
roared
and
the
whole
class
jumped
again
Now
those
three
curses
Avada
Kedavra
Imperius
and
Cruciatus
are
known
the
Unforgivable
Curses
The
use
any
one
them

Azkaban
That
what

That
what

You

You
need
arming
But
most
all
you
need
practice
constant
never
ceasing
vigilance
Get
out
your
quills
copy
this
down
They
spent
the
rest
the
lesson
taking
notes
each
the
Unforgivable
Curses
one
spoke
until
the
bell
rang
but
when
Moody
had
dismissed
them
and
they
had
left
the
classroom
torrent
talk
burst
forth
Most
people
were
discussing
the
curses
awed
voices
Did
you
see
twitch
and
when
killed
just
like
that
They
were
talking
about
the
lesson
Harry
thought
though
had
been
some
sort
spectacular
show
but
hadn
found
very
entertaining
and
nor
seemed
had
Hermione
Hurry
she
said
tensely
Harry
and
Ron
Not
the
ruddy
library
again
said
Ron
said
Hermione
curtly
pointing
side
passage
Neville
Neville
was
standing
alone
halfway
the
passage
staring
the
stone
wall
opposite
him
with
the
same
horrified
wide
eyed
look
had
worn
when
Moody
had
demonstrated
the
Cruciatus
Curse
Neville
Hermione
said
gently
Neville
looked
around
hello
said
his
voice
much
higher
than
usual
Interesting
lesson
wasn
wonder
what
for
dinner
starving
aren
you
Neville
are
you
all
right
said
Hermione
yes
fine
Neville
gabbled
the
same
unnaturally
high
voice
Very
interesting
dinner
mean
lesson
what
for
eating
Ron
gave
Harry
startled
look
Neville
what
But
odd
clunking
noise
sounded
behind
them
and
they
turned
see
Professor
Moody
limping
toward
them
All
four
them
fell
silent
watching
him
apprehensively
but
when
spoke
was
much
lower
and
gentler
growl
than
they
had
yet
heard
all
right
sonny
said
Neville
Why
don
you
come
office
Come
can
have
cup
tea
Neville
looked
even
more
frightened
the
prospect
tea
with
Moody
neither
moved
nor
spoke
Moody
turned
his
magical
eye
upon
Harry
You
all
right
are
you
Potter
Yes
said
Harry
almost
defiantly
Moody
blue
eye
quivered
slightly
its
socket
surveyed
Harry
Then
said
You
got
know
seems
harsh
maybe
but
you
got
know
point
pretending
well
come
Longbottom
got
some
books
that
might
interest
you
Neville
looked
pleadingly
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
but
they
didn
say
anything
Neville
had
choice
but
allow
himself
steered
away
one
Moody
gnarled
hands
his
shoulder
What
was
that
about
said
Ron
watching
Neville
and
Moody
turn
the
corner
don
know
said
Hermione
looking
pensive
Some
lesson
though
said
Ron
Harry
they
set
off
for
the
Great
Hall
Fred
and
George
were
right
weren
they
really
knows
his
stuff
Moody
doesn
When
did
Avada
Kedavra
the
way
that
spider
just
died
just
snuffed
right
But
Ron
fell
suddenly
silent
the
look
Harry
face
and
didn
speak
again
until
they
reached
the
Great
Hall
when
said
supposed
they
had
better
make
start
Professor
Trelawney
predictions
tonight
since
they
would
take
hours
Hermione
did
not
join
with
Harry
and
Ron
conversation
during
dinner
but
ate
furiously
fast
and
then
left
for
the
library
again
Harry
and
Ron
walked
back
Gryffindor
Tower
and
Harry
who
had
been
thinking
nothing
else
all
through
dinner
now
raised
the
subject
the
Unforgivable
Curses
himself
Wouldn
Moody
and
Dumbledore
trouble
with
the
Ministry
they
knew
seen
the
curses
Harry
asked
they
approached
the
Fat
Lady
Yeah
probably
said
Ron
But
Dumbledore
always
done
things
his
way
hasn
and
Moody
been
getting
trouble
for
years
reckon
Attacks
first
and
asks
questions
later
look
his
dustbins
Balderdash
The
Fat
Lady
swung
forward
reveal
the
entrance
hole
and
they
climbed
into
the
Gryffindor
common
room
which
was
crowded
and
noisy
Shall
get
our
Divination
stuff
then
said
Harry
pose
Ron
groaned
They
went
the
dormitory
fetch
their
books
and
charts
find
Neville
there
alone
sitting
his
bed
reading
looked
good
deal
calmer
than
the
end
Moody
lesson
though
still
not
entirely
normal
His
eyes
were
rather
red
You
all
right
Neville
Harry
asked
him
yes
said
Neville
fine
thanks
Just
reading
this
book
Professor
Moody
lent
held
the
book
Magical
Water
Plants
the
Mediterranean
Apparently
Professor
Sprout
told
Professor
Moody
really
good
Herbology
Neville
said
There
was
faint
note
pride
his
voice
that
Harry
had
rarely
heard
there
before
thought
like
this
Telling
Neville
what
Professor
Sprout
had
said
Harry
thought
had
been
very
tactful
way
cheering
Neville
for
Neville
very
rarely
heard
that
was
good
anything
was
the
sort
thing
Professor
Lupin
would
have
done
Harry
and
Ron
took
their
copies
Unfogging
the
Future
back
down
the
common
room
found
table
and
set
work
their
predictions
for
the
coming
month
hour
later
they
had
made
very
little
progress
though
their
table
was
littered
with
bits
parchment
bearing
sums
and
symbols
and
Harry
brain
was
fogged
though
had
been
filled
with
the
fumes
from
Professor
Trelawney
fire
haven
got
clue
what
this
lot
supposed
mean
said
staring
down
long
list
calculations
You
know
said
Ron
whose
hair
was
end
because
all
the
times
had
run
his
fingers
through
frustration
think
back
the
old
Divination
standby
What
make
Yeah
said
Ron
sweeping
the
jumble
scrawled
notes
off
the
table
dipping
his
pen
into
some
ink
and
starting
write
Next
Monday
said
scribbled
likely
develop
cough
owing
the
unlucky
conjunction
Mars
and
Jupiter
looked
Harry
You

Harry
crumpling
his
first
attempt
and
lobbing
over
the
heads
group
chattering
first
years
into
the
fire
Okay

said
Ron
darkly
seeing
the
skrewts
again
Monday

Lose

said
Harry
who
was
flicking
through
Unfogging
the
Future
for
ideas
Good

Ron
copying
down
Because
erm
Mercury
Why
don
you
get
stabbed

back

said
Harry
scribbling

because

fight
Aaah

going
have
fight
Okay
lose
bet
Yeah
you
betting
win
fight
They
continued
make
predictions
which
grew
steadily
more
tragic
for
another
hour
while
the
common
room
around
them
slowly
emptied
people
went
bed
Crookshanks
wandered
over
them
leapt
lightly
into
empty
chair
and
stared
inscrutably
Harry
rather
Hermione
might
look
she
knew
they
weren
doing
their
homework
properly
Staring
around
the
room
trying
think
kind
misfortune
hadn
yet
used
Harry
saw
Fred
and
George
sitting
together
against
the
opposite
wall
heads
together
quills
out
poring
over
single
piece
parchment
was
most
unusual
see
Fred
and
George
hidden
away
corner
and
working
silently
they
usually
liked
the
thick
things
and
the
noisy
center
attention
There
was
something
secretive
about
the
way
they
were
working
the
piece
parchment
and
Harry
was
reminded
how
they
had
sat
together
writing
something
back
the
Burrow
had
thought
then
that
was
another
order
form
for
Weasleys
Wizard
Wheezes
but
didn
look
like
that
this
time
had
been
they
would
surely
have
let
Lee
Jordan
the
joke
wondered
whether
had
anything
with
entering
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Harry
watched
George
shook
his
head
Fred
scratched
out
something
with
his
quill
and
said
very
quiet
voice
that
nevertheless
carried
across
the
almost
deserted
room
that
sounds
like
accusing
him
Got
careful
Then
George
looked
over
and
saw
Harry
watching
him
Harry
grinned
and
quickly
returned
his
predictions
didn
want
George
think
was
eavesdropping
Shortly
after
that
the
twins
rolled
their
parchment
said
good
night
and
went
off
bed
Fred
and
George
had
been
gone
ten
minutes
when
the
portrait
hole
opened
and
Hermione
climbed
into
the
common
room
carrying
sheaf
parchment
one
hand
and
box
whose
contents
rattled
she
walked
the
other
Crookshanks
arched
his
back
purring
Hello
she
said
just
finished
have
said
Ron
triumphantly
throwing
down
his
quill
Hermione
sat
down
laid
the
things
she
was
carrying
empty
armchair
and
pulled
Ron
predictions
toward
her
Not
going
have
very
good
month
are
you
she
said
sardonically
Crookshanks
curled
her
lap
well
least
forewarned
Ron
yawned
You
seem
drowning
twice
said
Hermione
said
Ron
peering
down
his
predictions
better
change
one
them
getting
trampled
rampaging
hippogriff
Don
you
think
bit
obvious
you
made
these
said
Hermione
How
dare
you
said
Ron
mock
outrage
been
working
like
house
elves
here
Hermione
raised
her
eyebrows
just
expression
said
Ron
hastily
Harry
laid
down
his
quill
too
having
just
finished
predicting
his
own
death
decapitation
What
the
box
asked
pointing
Funny
you
should
ask
said
Hermione
with
nasty
look
Ron
She
took
off
the
lid
and
showed
them
the
contents
Inside
were
about
fifty
badges
all
different
colors
but
all
bearing
the
same
letters
Spew
said
Harry
picking
badge
and
looking
What
this
about
Not
spew
said
Hermione
impatiently
Stands
for
the
Society
for
the
Promotion
Elfish
Welfare
Never
heard
said
Ron
Well
course
you
haven
said
Hermione
briskly
only
just
started
Yeah
said
Ron
mild
surprise
How
many
members
have
you
got
Well
you
two
join
three
said
Hermione
And
you
think
want
walk
around
wearing
badges
saying
spew
you
said
Ron
said
Hermione
hotly
was
going
put
Stop
the
Outrageous
Abuse
Our
Fellow
Magical
Creatures
and
Campaign
for
Change
Their
Legal
Status
but
wouldn
fit
that
the
heading
our
manifesto
She
brandished
the
sheaf
parchment
them
been
researching
thoroughly
the
library
Elf
enslavement
goes
back
centuries
can
believe
one
done
anything
about
before
now
Hermione
open
your
ears
said
Ron
loudly
They
Like
They
like
being
enslaved
Our
short
term
aims
said
Hermione
speaking
even
more
loudly
than
Ron
and
acting
though
she
hadn
heard
word
are
secure
house
elves
fair
wages
and
working
conditions
Our
long
term
aims
include
changing
the
law
about
non
wand
use
and
trying
get
elf
into
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
Magical
Creatures
because
they
shockingly
underrepresented
And
how
all
this
Harry
asked
start
recruiting
members
said
Hermione
happily
thought
two
Sickles
join
that
buys
badge
and
the
proceeds

fund
our
leaflet
campaign
You

Ron
got
you
collecting
tin

write
down
everything
saying
now
record
our
first
meeting
There
was
pause
which
Hermione
beamed
the
pair
them
and
Harry
sat
torn
between
exasperation
Hermione
and
amusement
the
look
Ron
face
The
silence
was
broken
not
Ron
who
any
case
looked
though
was
temporarily
dumbstruck
but
soft
tap
tap
the
window
Harry
looked
across
the
now
empty
common
room
and
saw
illuminated
the
moonlight
snowy
owl
perched
the
windowsill
Hedwig
shouted
and
launched
himself
out
his
chair
and
across
the
room
pull
open
the
window
Hedwig
flew
inside
soared
across
the
room
and
landed
the
table
top
Harry
predictions
About
time
said
Harry
hurrying
after
her
She
got
answer
said
Ron
excitedly
pointing
the
grubby
piece
parchment
tied
Hedwig
leg
Harry
hastily
untied
and
sat
down
read
whereupon
Hedwig
fluttered
onto
his
knee
hooting
softly
What
does
say
Hermione
asked
breathlessly
The
letter
was
very
short
and
looked
though
had
been
scrawled
great
hurry
Harry
read
aloud
Harry
flying
north
immediately
This
news
about
your
scar
the
latest
series
strange
rumors
that

reached
here

straight
Dumbledore
they
saying
got
Mad
Eye
out

which
means

signs

Ron
and
Hermione
Keep

eyes
open
Harry
Sirius
Harry
looked
Ron
and
Hermione
who
stared
back
him
flying
north
Hermione
whispered
coming
back
Dumbledore
reading
what
signs
said
Ron
looking
perplexed
Harry
what
For
Harry
had
just
hit
himself
the
forehead
with
his
fist
jolting
Hedwig
out
his
lap
shouldn
told
him
Harry
said
furiously
What
are
you
about
said
Ron
surprise
made
him
think
got
come
back
said
Harry
now
slamming
his
fist
the
table
that
Hedwig
landed
the
back
Ron
chair
hooting
indignantly
Coming
back
because
thinks
trouble
And
there
nothing
wrong
with
And
haven
got
anything
for
you
Harry
snapped
Hedwig
who
was
clicking
her
beak
expectantly
you
have
the
Owlery
you
want
food
Hedwig
gave
him
extremely
offended
look
and
took
off
for
the
open
window
cuffing
him
around
the
head
with
her
outstretched
wing
she
went
Harry
Hermione
began
pacifying
sort
voice
going
bed
said
Harry
shortly
See
you
the
morning
Upstairs
the
dormitory
pulled
his
pajamas
and
got
into
his
four
poster
but
didn
feel
remotely
tired
Sirius
came
back
and
got
caught
would
his
Harry
fault
Why
hadn
kept
his
mouth
shut
few
seconds
pain
and
had
blab
just
had
the
sense
keep
himself
heard
Ron
come
into
the
dormitory
short
while
later
but
did
not
speak
him
For
long
time
Harry
lay
staring
the
dark
canopy
his
bed
The
dormitory
was
completely
silent
and
had
been
less
preoccupied
Harry
would
have
realized
that
the
absence
Neville
usual
snores
meant
that
was
not
the
only
one
lying
awake
CHAPTER
FIFTEEN
BEAUXBATONS
AND
DURMSTRANG
Early
next
morning
Harry
woke
with
plan
fully
formed
his
mind
though
his
sleeping
brain
had
been
working
all
night
got
dressed
the
pale
dawn
light
left
the
dormitory
without
waking
Ron
and
went
back
down
the
deserted
common
room
Here
took
piece
parchment
from
the
table
upon
which
his
Divination
homework
still
lay
and
wrote
the
following
letter
Dear
Sirius
reckon
just
imagined
scar
hurting
was
half
asleep
when
wrote
you
last
time
There
point
coming
back
everything
fine
here
Don
worry
about
head
feels
completely
normal
Harry
then
climbed
out
the
portrait
hole
through
the
silent
castle
held
only
briefly
Peeves
who
tried
overturn
large
vase
him
halfway
along
the
fourth
floor
corridor
finally
arriving
the
Owlery
which
was
situated
the
top
West
Tower
The
Owlery
was
circular
stone
room
rather
cold
and
drafty
because
none
the
windows
had
glass
them
The
floor
was
entirely
covered
straw
owl
droppings
and
the
regurgitated
skeletons
mice
and
voles
Hundreds
upon
hundreds
owls
every
breed
imaginable
were
nestled
here
perches
that
rose
right
the
top
the
tower
nearly
all
them
asleep
though
here
and
there
round
amber
eye
glared
Harry
spotted
Hedwig
nestled
between
barn
owl
and
tawny
and
hurried
over
her
sliding
little
the
dropping
strewn
floor
took
him
while
persuade
her
wake
and
then
look
him
she
kept
shuffling
around
her
perch
showing
him
her
tail
She
was
evidently
still
furious
about
his
lack
gratitude
the
previous
night
the
end
was
Harry
suggesting
she
might
too
tired
and
that
perhaps
would
ask
Ron
borrow
Pigwidgeon
that
made
her
stick
out
her
leg
and
allow
him
tie
the
letter
Just
find
him
all
right
Harry
said
stroking
her
back
carried
her
his
arm
one
the
holes
the
wall
Before
the
dementors
She
nipped
his
finger
perhaps
rather
harder
than
she
would
ordinarily
have
done
but
hooted
softly
reassuring
sort
way
all
the
same
Then
she
spread
her
wings
and
took
off
into
the
sunrise
Harry
watched
her
fly
out
sight
with
the
familiar
feeling
unease
back
his
stomach
had
been
sure
that
Sirius
reply
would
alleviate
his
worries
rather
than
increasing
them
That
was
lie
Harry
said
Hermione
sharply
over
breakfast
when
told
her
and
Ron
what
had
done
You
didn
imagine
your
scar
hurting
and
you
know
what
said
Harry
not
going
back
Azkaban
because
Drop
said
Ron
sharply
Hermione
she
opened
her
mouth
argue
some
more
and
for
once
Hermione
heeded
him
and
fell
silent
Harry
did
his
best
not
worry
about
Sirius
over
the
next
couple
weeks
True
could
not
stop
himself
from
looking
anxiously
around
every
morning
when
the
post
owls
arrived
nor
late
night
before
went
sleep
prevent
himself
from
seeing
horrible
visions
Sirius
cornered
dementors
down
some
dark
London
street
but
betweentimes
tried
keep
his
mind
off
his
godfather
wished
still
had
Quidditch
distract
him
nothing
worked
well
troubled
mind
good
hard
training
session
the
other
hand
their
lessons
were
becoming
more
difficult
and
demanding
than
ever
before
particularly
Moody
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
their
surprise
Professor
Moody
had
announced
that
would
putting
the
Imperius
Curse
each
them
turn
demonstrate
its
power
and
see
whether
they
could
resist
its
effects
But
but
you
said
illegal
Professor
said
Hermione
uncertainly
Moody
cleared
away
the
desks
with
sweep
his
wand
leaving
large
clear
space
the
middle
the
room
You
said
use
against
another
human
was
Dumbledore
wants
you
taught
what
feels
like
said
Moody
his
magical
eye
swiveling
onto
Hermione
and
fixing
her
with
eerie
unblinking
stare
you
rather
learn
the
hard
way
when
someone
putting
you
they
can
control
you
completely
fine
You
excused
Off
you
pointed
one
gnarled
finger
toward
the
door
Hermione
went
very
pink
and
muttered
something
about
not
meaning
that
she
wanted
leave
Harry
and
Ron
grinned
each
other
They
knew
Hermione
would
rather
eat
bubotuber
pus
than
miss
such
important
lesson
Moody
began
beckon
students
forward
turn
and
put
the
Imperius
Curse
upon
them
Harry
watched
one
one
his
classmates
did
the
most
extraordinary
things
under
its
influence
Dean
Thomas
hopped
three
times
around
the
room
singing
the
national
anthem
Lavender
Brown
imitated
squirrel
Neville
performed
series
quite
astonishing
gymnastics
would
certainly
not
have
been
capable
his
normal
state
Not
one
them
seemed
able
fight
off
the
curse
and
each
them
recovered
only
when
Moody
had
removed
Potter
Moody
growled
you
next
Harry
moved
forward
into
the
middle
the
classroom
into
the
space
that
Moody
had
cleared
desks
Moody
raised
his
wand
pointed
Harry
and
said
1mperio
was
the
most
wonderful
feeling
Harry
felt
floating
sensation
every
thought
and
worry
his
head
was
wiped
gently
away
leaving
nothing
but
vague
untraceable
happiness
stood
there
feeling
immensely
relaxed
only
dimly
aware
everyone
watching
him
And
then
heard
Mad
Eye
Moody
voice
echoing
some
distant
chamber
his
empty
brain
Jump
onto
the
desk
jump
onto
the
desk
Harry
bent
his
knees
obediently
preparing
spring
Jump
onto
the
desk
Why
though
Another
voice
had
awoken
the
back
his
brain
Stupid
thing
really
said
the
voice
Jump
onto
the
desk
don
think
will
thanks
said
the
other
voice
little
more
firmly
don
really
want
Jump
NOW
The
next
thing
Harry
felt
was
considerable
pain
had
both
jumped
and
tried
prevent
himself
from
jumping
the
result
was
that
smashed
headlong
into
the
desk
knocking
over
and
the
feeling
his
legs
fractured
both
his
kneecaps
Now
that
more
like
growled
Moody
voice
and
suddenly
Harry
felt
the
empty
echoing
feeling
his
head
disappear
remembered
exactly
what
was
happening
and
the
pain
his
knees
seemed
double
Look
that
you
lot
Potter
fought
fought
and
damn
near
beat
try
that
again
Potter
and
the
rest
you
pay
attention
watch
his
eyes
that
where
you
see
very
good
Potter
very
good
indeed
They
have
trouble
controlling
you
The
way
talks
Harry
muttered
hobbled
out
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
class
hour
later
Moody
had
insisted
putting
Harry
through
his
paces
four
times
row
until
Harry
could
throw
off
the
curse
entirely
you
think
were
all
going
attacked
any
second
Yeah
know
said
Ron
who
was
skipping
every
alternate
step
had
had
much
more
difficulty
with
the
curse
than
Harry
though
Moody
assured
him
the
effects
would
wear
off
lunchtime
Talk
about
paranoid
Ron
glanced
nervously
over
his
shoulder
check
that
Moody
was
definitely
out
earshot
and
went
wonder
they
were
glad
get
shot
him
the
Ministry
Did
you
hear
him
telling
Seamus
what
did
that
witch
who
shouted
Boo
behind
him
April
Fools
Day
And
when
are
supposed
read
resisting
the
Imperius
Curse
with
everything
else
got
All
the
fourth
years
had
noticed
definite
increase
the
amount
work
they
were
required
this
term
Professor
McGonagall
explained
why
when
the
class
gave
particularly
loud
groan
the
amount
Transfiguration
homework
she
had
assigned
You
are
now
entering
most
important
phase
your
magical
education
she
told
them
her
eyes
glinting
dangerously
behind
her
square
spectacles
Your
Ordinary
Wizarding
Levels
are
drawing
closer
don
take
till
fifth
year
aid
Dean
Thomas
indignantly
Maybe
not
Thomas
but
believe
you
need
all
the
preparation
you
can
get
Miss
Granger
remains
the
only
person
this
class
who
has
managed
turn
hedgehog
into
satisfactory
pincushion
might
remind
you
that
your
pincushion
Thomas
still
curls
fright
anyone
approaches
with
pin
Hermione
who
had
turned
rather
pink
again
seemed
trying
not
look
too
pleased
with
herself
Harry
and
Ron
were
deeply
amused
when
Professor
Trelawney
told
them
that
they
had
received
top
marks
for
their
homework
their
next
Divination
class
She
read
out
large
portions
their
predictions
commending
them
for
their
unflinching
acceptance
the
horrors
store
for
them
but
they
were
less
amused
when
she
asked
them
the
same
thing
for
the
month
after
next
both
them
were
running
out
ideas
for
catastrophes
Meanwhile
Professor
Binns
the
ghost
who
taught
History
Magic
had
them
writing
weekly
essays
the
goblin
rebellions
the
eighteenth
century
Professor
Snape
was
forcing
them
research
antidotes
They
took
this
one
seriously
had
hinted
that
might
poisoning
one
them
before
Christmas
see
their
antidote
worked
Professor
Flitwick
had
asked
them
read
three
extra
books
preparation
for
their
lesson
Summoning
Charms
Even
Hagrid
was
adding
their
workload
The
Blast
Ended
Skrewts
were
growing
remarkable
pace
given
that
nobody
had
yet
discovered
what
they
ate
Hagrid
was
delighted
and
part
their
project
suggested
that
they
come
down
his
hut
alternate
evenings
observe
the
skrewts
and
make
notes
their
extraordinary
behavior
will
not
said
Draco
Malfoy
flatly
when
Hagrid
had
proposed
this
with
the
air
Father
Christmas
pulling
extra
large
toy
out
his
sack
see
enough
these
foul
things
during
lessons

Hagrid
smile
faded
off
his
face
Yeh

Malfoy
The
Gryffindors
roared
with
laughter
Malfoy
flushed
with
anger
but
apparently
the
memory
Moody
punishment
was
still
sufficiently
painful
stop
him
from
retorting
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
returned
the
castle
the
end
the
lesson
high
spirits
seeing
Hagrid
put
down
Malfoy
was
particularly
satisfying
especially
because
Malfoy
had
done
his
very
best
get
Hagrid
sacked
the
previous
year
When
they
arrived
the
entrance
hall
they
found
themselves
unable
proceed
owing
the
large
crowd
students
congregated
there
all
milling
around
large
sign
that
had
been
erected
the
foot
the
marble
staircase
Ron
the
tallest
the
three
stood
tiptoe
see
over
the
heads
front
them
and
read
the
sign
aloud

other
two

Ernie
Macmillan
Hufflepuff
emerging
from
the
crowd
his
eyes
gleaming
wonder
Cedric

Think
and
tell

Cedric
said
Ron
blankly
Ernie
hurried
off
Diggory
said
Harry
must
entering
the
tournament
That
idiot
Hogwarts
champion
said
Ron
they
pushed
their
way
through
the
chattering
crowd
toward
the
staircase
not
idiot
You
just
don
like
him
because
beat
Gryffindor
Quidditch
said
Hermione
heard
really
good
student
and
prefect
She
spoke
though
this
settled
the
matter
You
only
like
him
because
handsome
said
Ron
scathingly
Excuse
don
like
people
just
because
they
handsome
said
Hermione
indignantly
Ron
gave
loud
false
cough
which
sounded
oddly
like
Lockhart
The
appearance
the
sign
the
entrance
hall
had
marked
effect
upon
the
inhabitants
the
castle
During
the
following
week
there
seemed
only
one
topic
conversation
matter
where
Harry
went
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Rumors
were
flying
from
student
student
like
highly
contagious
germs
who
was
going
try
for
Hogwarts
champion
what
the
tournament
would
involve
how
the
students
from
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
differed
from
themselves
Harry
noticed
too
that
the
castle
seemed
undergoing
extra
thorough
cleaning
Several
grimy
portraits
had
been
scrubbed
much
the
displeasure
their
subjects
who
sat
huddled
their
frames
muttering
darkly
and
wincing
they
felt
their
raw
pink
faces
The
suits
armor
were
suddenly
gleaming
and
moving
without
squeaking
and
Argus
Filch
the
caretaker
was
behaving
ferociously
any
students
who
forgot
wipe
their
shoes
that
terrified
pair
first
year
girls
into
hysterics
Other
members
the
staff
seemed
oddly
tense
too
Longbottom
kindly
not
reveal
that
you
can
even
perform
simple
Switching
Spell
front
anyone
from
Durmstrang
Professor
McGonagall
barked
the
end
one
particularly
difficult
lesson
during
which
Neville
had
accidentally
transplanted
his
own
ears
onto
cactus
When
they
went
down
breakfast
the
morning
the
thirtieth
October
they
found
that
the
Great
Hall
had
been
decorated
overnight
Enormous
silk
banners
hung
from
the
walls
each
them
representing
Hogwarts
House
red
with
gold
lion
for
Gryffiindor
blue
with
bronze
eagle
for
Ravenclaw
yellow
with
black
badger
for
Hufflepuff
and
green
with
silver
serpent
for
Slytherin
Behind
the
teachers
table
the
largest
banner
all
bore
the
Hogwarts
coat
arms
lion
eagle
badger
and
snake
united
around
large
letter
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
down
beside
Fred
and
George
the
Gryffindor
table
Once
again
and
most
unusually
they
were
sitting
apart
from
everyone
else
and
conversing
low
voices
Ron
led
the
way
over
them
bummer
all
right
George
was
saying
gloomily
Fred
But
won
talk
person
have
send
him
the
letter
after
all
stuff
into
his
hand
can
avoid
forrever
Who
avoiding
you
said
Ron
sitting
down
next
them
Wish
you
would
said
Fred
looking
irritated
the
interruption
What
bummer
Ron
asked
George
Having
nosy
git
like
you
for
brother
said
George
You
two
got
any
ideas
the
Triwizard
Tournament
yet
Harry
asked
Thought
any
more
about
trying
enter
asked
McGonagall
how
the
champions
are
chosen
but
she
wasn
telling
said
George
bitterly
She
just
told
shut
and
get
with
transfiguring
raccoon
Wonder
what
the
tasks
are
going
said
Ron
thoughtfully
You
know
bet
could
them
Harry
done
dangerous
stuff
before
Not
front
panel
judges
you
haven
said
Fred
McGonagall
says
the
champions
get
awarded
points
according
how
well
they
done
the
tasks
Who
are
the
judges
Harry
asked
Well
the
Heads
the
participating
schools
are
always
the
panel
said
Hermione
and
everyone
looked
around
her
rather
surprised
because
all
three
them
were
injured
during
the
Tournament
1792
when
cockatrice
the
champions
were
supposed
catching
went
the
rampage
She
noticed
them
all
looking
her
and
said
with
her
usual
air
impatience
that
nobody
else
had
read
all
the
books
she
had
all
Hogwarts
History
Though
course
that
book
not
entirely
reliable
Revised
History
Hogwarts
would
more
accurate
title
Highly
Biased
and
Selective
History
Hogwarts
Which
Glosses
Over
the
Nastier
Aspects

School
What
are
you
about
said
Ron
though
Harry
thought
knew
what
was
coming
House
elves
said
Hermione
her
eyes
flashing
Not
once
over
thousand
pages
does
Hogwarts
History
mention
that
are
all
colluding
the
oppression
hundred
slaves
Harry
shook
his
head
and
applied
himself
his
scrambled
eggs
His
and
Ron
lack
enthusiasm
had
done
nothing
whatsoever
curb
Hermione
determination
pursue
justice
for
house
elves
True
both
them
had
paid
two
Sickles
for
badge
but
they
had
only
done
keep
her
quiet
Their
Sickles
had
been
wasted
however
anything
they
seemed
have
made
Hermione
more
vociferous
She
had
been
badgering
Harry
and
Ron
ever
since
first
wear
the
badges
then
persuade
others
the
same
and
she
had
also
taken
rattling
around
the
Gryffindor
common
room
every
evening
cornering
people
and
shaking
the
collecting
tin
under
their
noses
You
realize
that
your
sheets
are
changed
your
fires
lit
your
classrooms
cleaned
and
your
food
cooked
group
magical
creatures
who
are
unpaid
and
enslaved
she
kept
saying
fiercely
Some
people
like
Neville
had
paid
just
stop
Hermione
from
glowering
them
few
seemed
mildly
interested
what
she
had
say
but
were
reluctant
take
more
active
role
campaigning
Many
regarded
the
whole
thing
joke
Ron
now
rolled
his
eyes
the
ceiling
which
was
flooding
them
all
autumn
sunlight
and
Fred
became
extremely
interested
his
bacon
both
twins
had
refused
buy
badge
George
however
leaned
toward
Hermione
Listen
have
you
ever
been
down
the
kitchens
Hermione
course
not
said
Hermione
curtly
hardly
think
students
are
supposed
Well
have
said
George
indicating
Fred
loads
times
nick
food
And
met
them
and
they
happy
They
think
they
got
the
best
job
the
world
That
because
they
uneducated
and
brainwashed
Hermione
began
hotly
but
her
next
few
words
were
drowned
out
the
sudden
whooshing
noise
from
overhead
which
announced
the
arrival
the
post
owls
Harry
looked
once
and
saw
Hedwig
soaring
toward
him
Hermione
stopped
talking
abruptly
she
and
Ron
watched
Hedwig
anxiously
she
fluttered
down
onto
Harry
shoulder
folded
her
wings
and
held
out
her
leg
wearily
Harry
pulled
off
Sirius
reply
and
offered
Hedwig
his
bacon
rinds
which
she
ate
gratefully
Then
checking
that
Fred
and
George
were
safely
immersed
further
discussions
about
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Harry
read
out
Sirius
letter
whisper
Ron
and
Hermione
Nice
try
Harry
back
the
country
and
well
hidden
want
you
keep
posted
everything
that
going
Hogwarts
Don
use
Hedwig
keep
changing
owls
and
don
worry
about
just
watch
out
for
yourself
Don
forget
what
said
about
your
scar
Sirius
Why
you
have
keep
changing
owls
Ron
asked
low
voice
Hedwig
attract
too
much
attention
said
Hermione
once
She
stands
out
snowy
owl
that
keeps
returning
wherever
hiding
mean
they
not
native
birds
are
they
Harry
rolled
the
letter
and
slipped
inside
his
robes
wondering
whether
felt
more
less
worried
than
before
supposed
that
Sirius
managing
get
back
without
being
caught
was
something
couldn
deny
either
that
the
idea
that
Sirius
was
much
nearer
was
reassuring
least
wouldn
have
wait
long
for
response
every
time
wrote
Thanks
Hedwig
said
stroking
her
She
hooted
sleepily
dipped
her
beak
briefly
into
his
goblet
orange
juice
then
took
off
again
clearly
desperate
for
good
long
sleep
the
Owlery
There
was
pleasant
feeling
anticipation
the
air
that
day
Nobody
was
very
attentive
lessons
being
much
more
interested
the
arrival
that
evening
the
people
from
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
even
Potions
was
more
bearable
than
usual
was
half
hour
shorter
When
the
bell
rang
early
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
hurried
Gryffindor
Tower
deposited
their
bags
and
books
they
had
been
instructed
pulled
their
cloaks
and
rushed
back
downstairs
into
the
entrance
hall
The
Heads
Houses
were
ordering
their
students
into
lines
Weasley
straighten
your
hat
Professor
McGonagall
snapped
Ron
Miss
Patil
take
that
ridiculous
thing
out
your
hair
Parvati
scowled
and
removed
large
ornamental
butterfly
from
the
end
her
plait
Follow
please
said
Professor
McGonagall
First
years
front
pushing
They
filed
down
the
steps
and
lined
front
the
castle
was
cold
clear
evening
dusk
was
falling
and
pale
transparent
looking
moon
was
already
shining
over
the
Forbidden
Forest
Harry
standing
between
Ron
and
Hermione
the
fourth
row
from
the
front
saw
Dennis
Creevey
positively
shivering
with
anticipation
among
the
other
first
years
Nearly
six
said
Ron
checking
his
watch
and
then
staring
down
the
drive
that
led
the
front
gates
How
you
reckon
they
coming
The
train
doubt
said
Hermione
How
then
Broomsticks
Harry
suggested
looking
the
starry
sky
don
think
not
from
that
far
away
Portkey
Ron
suggested
they
could
Apparate
maybe
you
allowed
under
seventeen
wherever
they
come
from
You
can
Apparate
inside
the
Hogwarts
grounds
how
often
have
tell
you
said
Hermione
impatiently
They
scanned
the
darkening
grounds
excitedly
but
nothing
was
moving
everything
was
still
silent
and
quite
usual
Harry
was
starting
feel
cold
wished
they
hurry
Maybe
the
foreign
students
were
preparing
dramatic
entrance
remembered
what
Weasley
had
said
back
the
campsite
before
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
always
the
same
can
resist
showing
off
when
get
together
And
then
Dumbledore
called
out
from
the
back
row
where
stood
with
the
other
teachers
Aha
Unless
very
much
mistaken
the
delegation
from
Beauxbatons
approaches
Where
said
many
students
eagerly
all
looking
different
directions
There
yelled
sixth
year
pointing
over
the
forest
Something
large
much
larger
than
broomstick
indeed
hundred
broomsticks
was
hurtling
across
the
deep
blue
sky
toward
the
castle
growing
larger
all
the
time
dragon
shrieked
one
the
first
years
losing
her
head
completely
Don
stupid
flying
house
said
Dennis
Creevey
Dennis
guess
was
closer
the
gigantic
black
shape
skimmed
over
the
treetops
the
Forbidden
Forest
and
the
lights
shining
from
the
castle
windows
hit
they
saw
gigantic
powderblue
horse
drawn
carriage
the
size
large
house
soaring
toward
them
pulled
through
the
air
dozen
winged
horses
all
palominos
and
each
the
size
elephant
The
front
three
rows
students
drew
backward
the
carriage
hurtled
ever
lower
coming
land
tremendous
speed
then
with
almighty
crash
that
made
Neville
jump
backward
onto
Slytherin
fifth
year
foot
the
horses
hooves
larger
than
dinner
plates
hit
the
ground
second
later
the
carriage
landed
too
bouncing
upon
its
vast
wheels
while
the
golden
horses
tossed
their
enormous
heads
and
rolled
large
fiery
red
eyes
Harry
just
had
time
see
that
the
door
the
carriage
bore
coat
arms
two
crossed
golden
wands
each
emitting
three
stars
before
opened
boy
pale
blue
robes
jumped
down
from
the
carriage
bent
forward
fumbled
for
moment
with
something
the
carriage
floor
and
unfolded
set
golden
steps
sprang
back
respectfully
Then
Harry
saw
shining
high
heeled
black
shoe
emerging
from
the
inside
the
carriage
shoe
the
size
child
sled
followed
almost
immediately
the
largest
woman
had
ever
seen
his
life
The
size
the
carriage
and
the
horses
was
immediately
explained
few
people
gasped
Harry
had
only
ever
seen
one
person
large
this
woman
his
life
and
that
was
Hagrid
doubted
whether
there
was
inch
difference
their
heights
Yet
somehow
maybe
simply
because
was
used
Hagrid
this
woman
now
the
foot
the
steps
and
looking
around
the
waiting
wide
eyed
crowd
seemed
even
more
unnaturally
large
she
stepped
into
the
light
flooding
from
the
entrance
hall
she
was
revealed
have
handsome
olive
skinned
face
large
black
liquid
looking
eyes
and
rather
beaky
nose
Her
hair
was
drawn
back
shining
knob
the
base
her
neck
She
was
dressed
from
head
foot
black
satin
and
many
magnificent
opals
gleamed
her
throat
and
her
thick
fingers
Dumbledore
started
clap
the
students
following
his
lead
broke
into
applause
too
many
them
standing
tiptoe
the
better
look
this
woman
Her
face
relaxed
into
gracious
smile
and
she
walked
forward
toward
Dumbledore
extending
glittering
hand
Dumbledore
though
tall
himself
had
barely
bend
kiss
dear
Madame
Maxime
said
Welcome
Hogwarts
Dumbly
dort
said
Madame
Maxime
deep
voice
ope
find
you
well
excellent
form
thank
you
said
Dumbledore
pupils
said
Madame
Maxime
waving
one
her
enormous
hands
carelessly
behind
her
Harry
whose
attention
had
been
focused
completely
upon
Madame
Maxime
now
noticed
that
about
dozen
boys
and
girls
all
the
look
them
their
late
teens
had
emerged
from
the
carriage
and
were
now
standing
behind
Madame
Maxime
They
were
shivering
which
was
unsurprising
given
that
their
robes
seemed
made
fine
silk
and
none
them
were
wearing
cloaks
few
had
wrapped
scarves
and
shawls
around
their
heads
From
what
Harry
could
see
them
they
were
standing
Madame
Maxime
enormous
shadow
they
were
staring
Hogwarts
with
apprehensive
looks
their
faces
Karkaroff
arrived
yet
Madame
Maxime
asked
should
here
any
moment
said
Dumbledore
Would
you
like
wait
here
and
greet
him
would
you
prefer
step
inside
and
warm
trifle
Warm
think
said
Madame
Maxime
But
orses
Our
Care
Magical
Creatures
teacher
will
delighted
take
care
them
said
Dumbledore
the
moment
has
returned
from
dealing
with
slight
situation
that
has
arisen
with
some
his
other
charges
Skrewts
Ron
muttered
Harry
grinning
steeds
require
forceful
andling
said
Madame
Maxime
looking
though
she
doubted
whether
any
Care
Magical
Creatures
teacher
Hogwarts
could
the
job
Zey
are
very
strong
assure
you
that
Hagrid
will
well
the
job
said
Dumbledore
smiling
Very
well
said
Madame
Maxime
bowing
slightly
Will
you
please
inform
zis
Agrid
zat
orses
drink
only
single
malt
whiskey
will
attended
said
Dumbledore
also
bowing
Come
said
Madame
Maxime
imperiously
her
students
and
the
Hogwarts
crowd
parted
allow
her
and
her
students
pass
the
stone
steps
How
big
you
reckon
Durmstrang
horses
are
going
Seamus
Finnigan
said
leaning
around
Lavender
and
Parvati
address
Harry
and
Ron
Well
they
any
bigger
than
this
lot
even
Hagrid
won
able
handle
them
said
Harry
That
hasn
been
attacked
his
skrewts
Wonder
what
with
them
Maybe
they
escaped
said
Ron
hopefully
don
say
that
said
Hermione
with
shudder
Imagine
that
lot
loose
the
grounds
They
stood
shivering
slightly
now
waiting
for
the
Durmstrang
party
arrive
Most
people
were
gazing
hopefully
the
sky
For
few
minutes
the
silence
was
broken
only
Madame
Maxime
huge
horses
snorting
and
stamping
But
then
Can
you
hear
something
said
Ron
suddenly
Harry
listened
loud
and
oddly
eerie
noise
was
drifting
toward
them
from
out
the
darkness
muffled
rumbling
and
sucking
sound
though
immense
vacuum
cleaner
were
moving
along
riverbed
The
lake
yelled
Lee
Jordan
pointing
down
Look
the
lake
From
their
position
the
top
the
lawns
overlooking
the
grounds
they
had
clear
view
the
smooth
black
surface
the
water
except
that
the
surface
was
suddenly
not
smooth
all
Some
disturbance
was
taking
place
deep
the
center
great
bubbles
were
forming
the
surface
waves
were
now
washing
over
the
muddy
banks
and
then
out
the
very
middle
the
lake
whirlpool
appeared
giant
plug
had
just
been
pulled
out
the
lake
floor
What
seemed
long
black
pole
began
rise
slowly
out
the
heart
the
whirlpool
and
then
Harry
saw
the
rigging
mast
said
Ron
and
Hermione
Slowly
magnificently
the
ship
rose
out
the
water
gleaming
the
moonlight
had
strangely
skeletal
look
about
though
were
resurrected
wreck
and
the
dim
misty
lights
shimmering
its
portholes
looked
like
ghostly
eyes
Finally
with
great
sloshing
noise
the
ship
emerged
entirely
bobbing
the
turbulent
water
and
began
glide
toward
the
bank
few
moments
later
they
heard
the
splash
anchor
being
thrown
down
the
shallows
and
the
thud
plank
being
lowered
onto
the
bank
People
were
disembarking
they
could
see
their
silhouettes
passing
the
lights
the
ship
portholes
All
them
Harry
noticed
seemed
built
along
the
lines
Crabbe
and
Goyle
but
then
they
drew
nearer
walking
the
lawns
into
the
light
streaming
from
the
entrance
hall
saw
that
their
bulk
was
really
due
the
fact
that
they
were
wearing
cloaks
some
kind
shaggy
matted
fur
But
the
man
who
was
leading
them
the
castle
was
wearing
furs
different
sort
sleek
and
silver
like
his
hair
Dumbledore
called
heartily
walked
the
slope
How
are
you
dear
fellow
how
are
you
Blooming
thank
you
Professor
Karkaroff
Dumbledore
replied
Karkaroff
had
fruity
unctuous
voice
when
stepped
into
the
light
pouring
from
the
front
doors
the
castle
they
saw
that
was
tall
and
thin
like
Dumbledore
but
his
white
hair
was
short
and
his
goatee
finishing
small
curl
did
not
entirely
hide
his
rather
weak
chin
When
reached
Dumbledore
shook
hands
with
both
his
own
Dear
old
Hogwarts
said
looking
the
castle
and
smiling
his
teeth
were
rather
yellow
and
Harry
noticed
that
his
smile
did
not
extend
his
eyes
which
remained
cold
and
shrewd
How
good
here
how
good
Viktor
come
along
into
the
warmth
you
don
mind
Dumbledore
Viktor
has
slight
head
cold
Karkaroff
beckoned
forward
one
his
students
the
boy
passed
Harry
caught
glimpse
prominent
curved
nose
and
thick
black
eyebrows
didn
need
the
punch
the
arm
Ron
gave
him
the
hiss
his
ear
recognize
that
profile
Harry
Krum
CHAPTER
SIXTEEN
THE
GOBLET
FIRE
don
believe
Ron
said
stunned
voice
the
Hogwarts
students
filed
back
the
steps
behind
the
party
from
Durmstrang
Krum
Harry
Viktor
Krum
For
heaven
sake
Ron
only
Quidditch
player
said
Hermione
Only
Quidditch
player
Ron
said
looking
her
though
couldn
believe
his
ears
Hermione
one
the
best
Seekers
the
world
had
idea
was
still
school
they
recrossed
the
entrance
hall
with
the
rest
the
Hogwarts
students
heading
for
the
Great
Hall
Harry
saw
Lee
Jordan
jumping
and
down
the
soles
his
feet
get
better
look
the
back
Krum
head
Several
sixth
year
girls
were
frantically
searching
their
pockets
they
walked
don
believe
haven
got
single
quill
you
think
sign
hat
lipstick
Really
Hermione
said
loftily
they
passed
the
girls
now
squabbling
over
the
lipstick
getting
his
autograph
can
said
Ron
You
haven
got
quill
have
you
Harry
Nope
they
upstairs
bag
said
Harry
They
walked
over
the
Gryffindor
table
and
sat
down
Ron
took
care
sit
the
side
facing
the
doorway
because
Krum
and
his
fellow
Durmstrang
students
were
still
gathered
around
apparently
unsure
about
where
they
should
sit
The
students
from
Beauxbatons
had
chosen
seats
the
Ravenclaw
table
They
were
looking
around
the
Great
Hall
with
glum
expressions
their
faces
Three
them
were
still
clutching
scarves
and
shawls
around
their
heads
not
that
cold
said
Hermione
defensively
Why
didn
they
bring
cloaks
Over
here
Come
and
sit
over
here
Ron
hissed
Over
here
Hermione
budge
make
space
What
Too
late
said
Ron
bitterly
Viktor
Krum
and
his
fellow
Durmstrang
students
had
settled
themselves
the
Slytherin
table
Harry
could
see
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
looking
very
smug
about
this
watched
Malfoy
bent
forward
speak
Krum
Yeah
that
right
smarm
him
Malfoy
said
Ron
scathingly
bet
Krum
can
see
right
through
him
though
bet
gets
people
fawning
over
him
all
the
time
Where
you
reckon
they
going
sleep
could
offer
him
space
our
dormitory
Harry
wouldn
mind
giving
him
bed
could
kip
camp
bed
Hermione
snorted
They
look
lot
happier
than
the
Beauxbatons
lot
said
Harry
The
Durmstrang
students
were
pulling
off
their
heavy
furs
and
looking
the
starry
black
ceiling
with
expressions
interest
couple
them
were
picking
the
golden
plates
and
goblets
and
examining
them
apparently
impressed
the
staff
table
Filch
the
caretaker
was
adding
chairs
was
wearing
his
moldy
old
tailcoat
honor
the
occasion
Harry
was
surprised
see
that
added
four
chairs
two
either
side
Dumbledore
But
there
are
only
two
extra
people
Harry
said
Why
Filch
putting
out
four
chairs
who
else
coming
said
Ron
vaguely
was
still
staring
avidly
Krum
When
all
the
students
had
entered
the
Hall
and
settled
down
their
House
tables
the
staff
entered
filing
the
top
table
and
taking
their
seats
Last
line
were
Professor
Dumbledore
Professor
Karkaroff
and
Madame
Maxime
When
their
headmistress
appeared
the
pupils
from
Beauxbatons
leapt
their
feet
few
the
Hogwarts
students
laughed
The
Beauxbatons
party
appeared
quite
unembarrassed
however
and
did
not
resume
their
seats
until
Madame
Maxime
had
sat
down
Dumbledore
left
hand
side
Dumbledore
remained
standing
and
silence
fell
over
the
Great
Hall
Good
evening
ladies
and
gentlemen
ghosts
and
most
particularly
guests
said
Dumbledore
beaming
around
the
foreign
students
have
great
pleasure
welcoming
you
all
Hogwarts
hope
and
trust
that
your
stay
here
will
both
comfortable
and
enjoyable
One
the
Beauxbatons
girls
still
clutching
muffler
around
her
head
gave
what
was
unmistakably
derisive
laugh
one
making
you
stay
Hermione
whispered
bristling
her
The
tournament
will
officially
opened
the
end
the
feast
said
Dumbledore
now
invite
you
all
eat
drink
and
make
yourselves
home
sat
down
and
Harry
saw
Karkaroff
lean
forward
once
and
engage
him
conversation
The
plates
front
them
filled
with
food
usual
The
house
elves
the
kitchen
seemed
have
pulled
out
all
the
stops
there
was
greater
variety
dishes
front
them
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
including
several
that
were
definitely
foreign
What
that
said
Ron
pointing
large
dish
some
sort
shellfish
stew
that
stood
beside
large
steak
and
kidney
pudding
Bouillabaisse
said
Hermione
Bless
you
said
Ron
French
said
Hermione
had
holiday
summer
before
last
very
nice
take
your
word
for
said
Ron
helping
himself
black
pudding
The
Great
Hall
seemed
somehow
much
more
crowded
than
usual
even
though
there
were
barely
twenty
additional
students
there
perhaps
was
because
their
differently
colored
uniforms
stood
out
clearly
against
the
black
the
Hogwarts
robes
Now
that
they
had
removed
their
furs
the
Durmstrang
students
were
revealed
wearing
robes
deep
bloodred
Hagrid
sidled
into
the
Hall
through
door
behind
the
staff
table
twenty
minutes
after
the
start
the
feast
slid
into
his
seat
the
end
and
waved
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
with
very
heavily
bandaged
hand
Skrewts
doing
all
right
Hagrid
Harry
called
Thrivin
Hagrid
called
back
happily
Yeah
just
bet
they
are
said
Ron
quietly
Looks
like
they
finally
found
food
they
like
doesn
Hagrid
fingers
that
moment
voice
said
Excuse
are
you
wanting
bouillabaisse
was
the
girl
from
Beauxbatons
who
had
laughed
during
Dumbledore
speech
She
had
finally
removed
her
muffler
long
sheet
silvery
blonde
hair
fell
almost
her
waist
She
had
large
deep
blue
eyes
and
very
white
even
teeth
Ron
went
purple
stared
her
opened
his
mouth
reply
but
nothing
came
out
except
faint
gurgling
noise
Yeah
have
said
Harry
pushing
the
dish
toward
the
girl
You
ave
finished
wiz
Yeah
Ron
said
breathlessly
Yeah
was
excellent
The
girl
picked
the
dish
and
carried
carefully
off
the
Ravenclaw
table
Ron
was
still
goggling
the
girl
though
had
never
seen
one
before
Harry
started
laugh
The
sound
seemed
jog
Ron
back
his
senses
She
veela
said
hoarsely
Harry
course
she
isn
said
Hermione
tartly
don
see
anyone
else
gaping
her
like
idiot
But
she
wasn
entirely
right
about
that
the
girl
crossed
the
Hall
many
boys
heads
turned
and
some
them
seemed
have
become
temporarily
speechless
just
like
Ron
telling
you
that
not
normal
girl
said
Ron
leaning
sideways
could
keep
clear
view
her
They
don
make
them
like
that
Hogwarts
They
make
them
okay
Hogwarts
said
Harry
without
thinking
Cho
happened
sitting
only
few
places
away
from
the
girl
with
the
silvery
hair
When
you
both
put
your
eyes
back
said
Hermione
briskly
you
able
see
who
just
arrived
She
was
pointing
the
staff
table
The
two
remaining
empty
seats
had
just
been
filled
Ludo
Bagman
was
now
sitting
Professor
Karkaroff
other
side
while
Crouch
Percy
boss
was
next
Madame
Maxime
What
are
they
doing
here
said
Harry
surprise
They
organized
the
Triwizard
Tournament
didn
they
said
Hermione
suppose
they
wanted
here
see
start
When
the
second
course
arrived
they
noticed
number
unfamiliar
desserts
too
Ron
examined
odd
sort
pale
blancmange
closely
then
moved
carefully
few
inches
his
right
that
would
clearly
visible
from
the
Ravenclaw
table
The
girl
who
looked
like
veela
appeared
have
eaten
enough
however
and
did
not
come
over
get
Once
the
golden
plates
had
been
wiped
clean
Dumbledore
stood
again
pleasant
sort
tension
seemed
fill
the
Hall
now
Harry
felt
slight
thrill
excitement
wondering
what
was
coming
Several
seats
down
from
them
Fred
and
George
were
leaning
forward
staring
Dumbledore
with
great
concentration
The
moment
has
come
said
Dumbledore
smiling
around
the
sea
upturned
faces
The
Triwizard
Tournament
about
start
would
like
say
few
words
explanation
before
bring
the
casket
The
what
Harry
muttered
Ron
shrugged
just
clarify
the
procedure
that
will
following
this
year
But
first
let
introduce
for
those
who
not
know
them
Bartemius
Crouch
Head
the
Department
International
Magical
Cooperation
there
was
smattering
polite
applause
and
Ludo
Bagman
Head
the
Department
Magical
Games
and
Sports
There
was
much
louder
round
applause
for
Bagman
than
for
Crouch
perhaps
because
his
fame
Beater
simply
because
looked
much
more
likable
acknowledged
with
jovial
wave
his
hand
Bartemius
Crouch
did
not
smile
wave
when
his
name
was
announced
Remembering
him
his
neat
suit
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
Harry
thought
looked
strange
wizard
robes
His
toothbrush
mustache
and
severe
parting
looked
very
odd
next
Dumbledore
long
white
hair
and
beard
Bagman
and
Crouch
have
worked
tirelessly
over
the
last
few
months
the
arrangements
for
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Dumbledore
continued
and
they
will
joining
myself
Professor
Karkaroff
and
Madame
Maxime
the
panel
that
will
judge
the
champions
efforts
the
mention
the
word
champions
the
attentiveness
the
listening
students
seemed
sharpen
Perhaps
Dumbledore
had
noticed
their
sudden
stillness
for
smiled
said
The
casket
then
you
please
Filch
Filch
who
had
been
lurking
unnoticed
far
corner
the
Hall
now
approached
Dumbledore
carrying
great
wooden
chest
encrusted
with
jewels
looked
extremely
old
murmur
excited
interest
rose
from
the
watching
students
Dennis
Creevey
actually
stood
his
chair
see
properly
but
being
tiny
his
head
hardly
rose
above
anyone
else
The
instructions
for
the
tasks
the
champions
will
face
this
year
have
already
been
examined
Crouch
and
Bagman
said
Dumbledore
Filch
placed
the
chest
carefully
the
table
before
him
and
they
have
made
the
necessary
arrangements
for
each
challenge
There
will
three
tasks
spaced
throughout
the
school
year
and
they
will
test
the
champions
many
different
ways
their
magical
prowess
their
daring
their
powers
deduction
and
course
their
ability
cope
with
danger
this
last
word
the
Hall
was
filled
with
silence
absolute
that
nobody
seemed
breathing
you
know
three
champions
compete
the
tournament
Dumbledore
went
calmly
one
from
each
the
participating
schools
They
will
marked
how
well
they
perform
each
the
Tournament
tasks
and
the
champion
with
the
highest
total
after
task
three
will
win
the
Triwizard
Cup
The
champions
will
chosen
impartial
selector
the
Goblet
Fire
Dumbledore
now
took
out
his
wand
and
tapped
three
times
upon
the
top
the
casket
The
lid
creaked
slowly
open
Dumbledore
reached
inside
and
pulled
out
large
roughly
hewn
wooden
cup
would
have
been
entirely
unremarkable
had
not
been
full
the
brim
with
dancing
blue
white
flames
Dumbledore
closed
the
casket
and
placed
the
goblet
carefully
top
where
would
clearly
visible
everyone
the
Hall
Anybody
wishing
submit
themselves
champion
must
write
their
name
and
school
clearly
upon
slip
parchment
and
drop
into
the
goblet
said
Dumbledore
Aspiring
champions
have
twenty
four
hours
which
put
their
names
forward
Tomorrow
night
Halloween
the
goblet
will
return
the
names
the
three
has
judged
most
worthy
represent
their
schools
The
goblet
will
placed
the
entrance
hall
tonight
where
will
freely
accessible
all
those
wishing
compete
ensure
that
underage
student
yields
temptation
said
Dumbledore
will
drawing
Age
Line
around
the
Goblet
Fire
once
has
been
placed
the
entrance
hall
Nobody
under
the
age
seventeen
will
able
cross
this
line
Finally
wish
impress
upon
any
you
wishing
compete
that
this
tournament
not
entered
into
lightly
Once
champion
has
been
selected
the
Goblet
Fire
she
obliged
see
the
tournament
through
the
end
The
placing
your
name
the
goblet
constitutes
binding
magical
contract
There
can
change
heart
once
you
have
become
champion
Please
very
sure
therefore
that
you
are
wholeheartedly
prepared
play
before
you
drop
your
name
into
the
goblet
Now
think
time
for
bed
Good
night
you
all
Age
Line
Fred
Weasley
said
his
eyes
glinting
they
all
made
their
way
across
the
Hall
the
doors
into
the
entrance
hall
Well
that
should
fooled
Aging
Potion
shouldn
And
once
your
name
that
goblet
you
laughing
can
tell
whether
you
seventeen
not
But
don
think
anyone
under
seventeen
will
stand
chance
said
Hermione
just
haven
learned
enough
Speak
for
yourself
said
George
shortly
You
try
and
get
won
you
Harry
Harry
thought
briefly
Dumbledore
insistence
that
nobody
under
seventeen
should
submit
their
name
but
then
the
wonderful
picture
himself
winning
the
Triwizard
Tournament
filled
his
mind
again
wondered
how
angry
Dumbledore
would
someone
younger
than
seventeen
did
find
way
get
over
the
Age
Line
Where
said
Ron
who
wasn
listening
word
this
conversation
but
looking
through
the
crowd
see
what
had
become
Krum
Dumbledore
didn
say
where
the
Durmstrang
people
are
sleeping
did
But
this
query
was
answered
almost
instantly
they
were
level
with
the
Slytherin
table
now
and
Karkaroff
had
just
bustled
his
students
Back
the
ship
then
was
saying
Viktor
how
are
you
feeling
Did
you
eat
enough
Should
send
for
some
mulled
wine
from
the
kitchens
Harry
saw
Krum
shake
his
head
pulled
his
furs
back
Professor
Ivood
like
some
vine
said
one
the
other
Durmstrang
boys
hopefully
wasn
offering
you
Poliakoff
snapped
Karkaroff
his
warmly
paternal
air
vanishing
instant
notice
you
have
dribbled
food
all
down
the
front
your
robes
again
disgusting
boy
Karkaroff
turned
and
led
his
students
toward
the
doors
reaching
them
exactly
the
same
moment
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
Harry
stopped
let
him
walk
through
first
Thank
you
said
Karkaroff
carelessly
glancing
him
And
then
Karkaroff
froze
turned
his
head
back
Harry
and
stared
him
though
couldn
believe
his
eyes
Behind
their
headmaster
the
students
from
Durmstrang
came
halt
too
Karkaroff
eyes
moved
slowly
Harry
face
and
fixed
upon
his
scar
The
Durmstrang
students
were
staring
curiously
Harry
too
Out
the
corner
his
eye
Harry
saw
comprehension
dawn
few
their
faces
The
boy
with
food
all
down
his
front
nudged
the
girl
next
him
and
pointed
openly
Harry
forehead
Yeah
that
Harry
Potter
said
growling
voice
from
behind
them
Professor
Karkaroff
spun
around
Mad
Eye
Moody
was
standing
there
leaning
heavily
his
staff
his
magical
eye
glaring
unblinkingly
the
Durmstrang
headmaster
The
color
drained
from
Karkaroff
face
Harry
watched
terrible
look
mingled
fury
and
fear
came
over
him
You
said
staring
Moody
though
unsure
was
really
seeing
him
said
Moody
grimly
And
unless
you
got
anything
say
Potter
Karkaroff
you
might
want
move
You
blocking
the
doorway
was
true
half
the
students
the
Hall
were
now
waiting
behind
them
looking
over
one
another
shoulders
see
what
was
causing
the
holdup
Without
another
word
Professor
Karkaroff
swept
his
students
away
with
him
Moody
watched
him
until
was
out
sight
his
magical
eye
fixed
upon
his
back
look
intense
dislike
upon
his
mutilated
face
the
next
day
was
Saturday
most
students
would
normally
have
breakfasted
late
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
however
were
not
alone
rising
much
earlier
than
they
usually
did
weekends
When
they
went
down
into
the
entrance
hall
they
saw
about
twenty
people
milling
around
some
them
eating
toast
all
examining
the
Goblet
Fire
had
been
placed
the
center
the
hall
the
stool
that
normally
bore
the
Sorting
Hat
thin
golden
line
had
been
traced
the
floor
forming
circle
ten
feet
around
every
direction
Anyone

their
name
yet
Ron
asked
third
year
girl
eagerly
All
the
Durmstrang
lot
she
replied
But

seen
anyone
from
Hogwarts
yet
Bet
some
them
put
last
night
after
all

said
Harry
would
had
been
wouldn
have
wanted
everyone
watching
What
the
goblet
just
gobbed
you
right
back
out
again
Someone
laughed
behind
Harry
Turning
saw
Fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
hurrying
down
the
staircase
all
three
them
looking
extremely
excited
Done
Fred
said
triumphant
whisper
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
Just

Fred
One

George
rubbing
his

glee

the
thousand
Galleons

said
Lee
grinning
broadly
not
sure

going
work

know
said
Hermione
warningly
sure
Dumbledore
will
have
thought
this
Fred
George
and
Lee
ignored
her
Ready
Fred
said
the
other
two
quivering
with
excitement
mon
then
first
Harry
watched
fascinated
Fred
pulled
slip
parchment
out
his
pocket
bearing
the
words
Fred
Weasley
Hogwarts
Fred
walked
right
the
edge
the
line
and
stood
there
rocking
his
toes
like
diver
preparing
for
fifty
foot
drop
Then
with
the
eyes
every
person
the
entrance
hall
upon
him
took
great
breath
and
stepped
over
the
line
For
split
second
Harry
thought
had
worked
George
certainly
thought
for
let
out
yell
triumph
and
leapt
after
Fred
but
next
moment
there
was
loud
sizzling
sound
and
both
twins
were
hurled
out
the
golden
circle
though
they
had
been
thrown
invisible
shot
putter
They
landed
painfully
ten
feet
away
the
cold
stone
floor
and
add
insult
injury
there
was
loud
popping
noise
and
both
them
sprouted
identical
long
white
beards
The
entrance
hall
rang
with
laughter
Even
Fred
and
George
joined
once
they
had
gotten
their
feet
and
taken
good
look
each
other
beards
did
warn
you
said
deep
amused
voice
and
everyone
turned
see
Professor
Dumbledore
coming
out
the
Great
Hall
surveyed
Fred
and
George
his
eyes
twinkling
suggest
you
both
Madam
Pomfrey
She
already
tending
Miss
Fawcett
Ravenclaw
and
Summers
Hufflepuff
both
whom
decided
age
themselves
little
too
Though
must
say
neither
their
beards
anything
like
fine
yours
Fred
and
George
set
off
for
the
hospital
wing
accompanied
Lee
who
was
howling
with
laughter
and
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
also
chortling
went
breakfast
The
decorations
the
Great
Hall
had
changed
this
morning
was
Halloween
cloud
live
bats
was
fluttering
around
the
enchanted
ceiling
while
hundreds
carved
pumpkins
leered
from
every
corner
Harry
led
the
way
over
Dean
and
Seamus
who
were
discussing
those
Hogwarts
students
seventeen
over
who
might
entering
There
rumor
going
around
that
Warrington
got
early
and
put
his
name
Dean
told
Harry
That
big
bloke
from
Slytherin
who

like
sloth
Harry
who
had
played
Quidditch
against
Warrington
shook
his
head
disgust

have
Slytherin
champion
And
all
the
Hufflepuffs
are
talking
about
Diggory
said
Seamus
contemptuously
But
wouldn
have
thought
have
wanted
risk
his
good
looks
Listen
said
Hermione
suddenly
People
were
cheering
out
the
entrance
hall
They
all
swiveled
around
their
seats
and
saw
Angelina
Johnson
coming
into
the
Hall
grinning
embarrassed
sort
way
tall
black
girl
who
played
Chaser
the
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
Angelina
came
over
them
sat
down
and
said
Well

said
Ron
looking
impressed

asked
Harry

Ron

week
said
Angelina
Well

said
Hermione

Angelina
Thanks
Hermione
said
Angelina
smiling
her
Yeah

Pretty
Boy
Diggory
said
Seamus
causing
several
Hufflepuffs
passing
their
table
scowl
heavily
him
What

Ron
asked
Harry
and
Hermione

they
had
finished

Great
Hall

Harry

she
said
brightly
Wait

while

upstairs
and
get

badges
What

said
Ron
exasperated
Hermione
ran
away
the
marble
staircase
Hey
Ron
said
Harry
suddenly
your
friend
The
students
from
Beauxbatons
were
coming
through
the
front
doors
from
the
grounds
among
them
the
veela
girl
Those
gathered
around
the
Goblet
Fire
stood
back
let
them
pass
watching
eagerly
Madame
Maxime
entered
the
hall
behind
her
students
and
organized
them
into
line
One
one
the
Beauxbatons
students
stepped
across
the
Age
Line
and
dropped
their
slips
parchment
into
the
blue
white
flames
each
name
entered
the
fire
turned
briefly
red
and
emitted
sparks
What

Ron
muttered
Harry
the
veela
girl
dropped
her
parchment
into
the
Goblet
Fire
Reckon
they
back
school
hang
around
watch
the
tournament
Dunno
said
Harry
Hang
around
suppose
Madame
Maxime
staying
judge
isn
she
When
all
the
Beauxbatons
students
had
submitted
their
names
Madame
Maxime
led
them
back
out
the
hall
and
out
onto
the
grounds
again
Where
are
they
sleeping
then
said
Ron
moving
toward
the
front
doors
and
staring
after
them
loud
rattling
noise
behind
them
announced
Hermione
reappearance
with
the
box
badges
good
hurry
said
Ron
and
jumped
down
the
stone
steps
keeping
his
eyes
the
back
the
veela
girl
who
was
now
halfway
across
the
lawn
with
Madame
Maxime
they
neared
Hagrid
cabin
the
edge
the
Forbidden
Forest
the
mystery
the
Beauxbatons
sleeping
quarters
was
solved
The
gigantic
powder
blue
carriage
which
they
had
arrived
had
been
parked
two
hundred
yards
from
Hagrid
front
door
and
the
students
were
climbing
back
inside
The
elephantine
flying
horses
that
had
pulled
the
carriage
were
now
grazing
makeshift
paddock
alongside
Harry
knocked
Hagrid
door
and
Fang
booming
barks
answered
instantly
Bout
time
said
Hagrid
when
flung
open
the
door
Thought
you
lot
forgotten
where
live
been
really
busy
Hag
Hermione
started
say
but
then
she
stopped
dead
looking
Hagrid
apparently
lost
for
words
Hagrid
was
wearing
his
best
and
very
horrible
hairy
brown
suit
plus
checked
yellow
and
orange
tie
This
wasn
the
worst
though
had
evidently
tried
tame
his
hair
using
large
quantities
what
appeared
axle
grease
was
now
slicked
down
into
two
bunches
perhaps
had
tried
ponytail
like
Bill
but
found
had
too
much
hair
The
look
didn
really
suit
Hagrid
all
For
moment
Hermione
goggled
him
then
obviously
deciding
not
comment
she
said
Erm
where
are
the
skrewts
Out
the
pumpkin
patch
said
Hagrid
happily
They
get
tin
massive
mus
nearly
three
foot
long
now
trouble
they
started
killin
each
other
really
said
Hermione
shooting
repressive
look
Ron
who
staring
Hagrid
odd
hairstyle
had
just
opened
his
mouth
say
something
about
Yeah
said
Hagrid
sadly
okay
though
got
separate
boxes
now
Still
got
abou
twenty
Well
that
lucky
said
Ron
Hagrid
missed
the
sarcasm
Hagrid
cabin
comprised
single
room
one
corner
which
was
gigantic
bed
covered
patchwork
quilt
similarly
enormous
wooden
table
and
chairs
stood
front
the
fire
beneath
the
quantity
cured
hams
and
dead
birds
hanging
from
the
ceiling
They
sat
down
the
table
while
Hagrid
started
make
tea
and
were
soon
immersed
yet
more
discussion
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Hagrid
seemed
quite
excited
about
they
were
You
wait
said
grinning
You
jus
wait
Yer
going
ter
see
some
stuff
yeh
never
seen
before
Firs
task
but
not
supposed
ter
say
Hagrid
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
urged
him
but
just
shook
his
head
grinning
don
want
ter
spoil
fer
yeh
said
Hagrid
But
gonna
spectacular
tell
yeh
that
Them
champions
going
ter
have
their
work
cut
out
Never
thought
live
ter
see
the
Triwizard
Tournament
played
again
They
ended
having
lunch
with
Hagrid
though
they
didn
eat
much
Hagrid
had
made
what
said
was
beef
casserole
but
after
Hermione
unearthed
large
talon
hers
she
Harry
and
Ron
rather
lost
their
appetites
However
they
enjoyed
themselves
trying
make
Hagrid
tell
them
what
the
tasks
the
tournament
were
going
speculating
which
the
entrants
were
likely
selected
champions
and
wondering
whether
Fred
and
George
were
beardless
yet
light
rain
had
started
fall
midafternoon
was
very
cozy
sitting
the
fire
listening
the
gentle
patter
the
drops
the
window
watching
Hagrid
darning
his
socks
and
arguing
with
Hermione
about
house
elves
for
flatly
refused
join
when
she
showed
him
her
badges
doin
unkindness
Hermione
said
gravely
threading
massive
bone
needle
with
thick
yellow
yarn
their
nature
ter
look
after
humans
that
what
they
like
see
Yeh
makin
unhappy
ter
take
away
their
work
insutin
yeh
tried
ter
pay
But
Harry
set
Dobby
free
and
was
over
the
moon
about
said
Hermione
And
heard
asking
for
wages
now
Yeah
well
yeh
get
weirdos
every
breed
not
sayin
there
isn
the
odd
elf
who
take
freedom
but
yeh
never
persuade
most
ter
nothin
doin
Hermione
Hermione
looked
very
cross
indeed
and
stuffed
her
box
badges
back
into
her
cloak
pocket
half
past
five
was
growing
dark
and
Ron
Harry
and
Hermione
decided
was
time
get
back
the
castle
for
the
Halloween
feast
and
more
important
the
announcement
the
school
champions
come
with
yeh
said
Hagrid
putting
away
his
darning
Jus
give
sec
Hagrid
got
went
across
the
chest
drawers
beside
his
bed
and
began
searching
for
something
inside
They
didn
pay
too
much
attention
until
truly
horrible
smell
reached
their
nostrils
Coughing
Ron
said
Hagrid
what
that
said
Hagrid
turning
around
with
large
bottle
his
hand
Don
yeh
like
that
aftershave
said
Hermione
slightly
choked
voice
eau
cologne
Hagrid
muttered
was
blushing
Maybe
bit
much
said
gruffly
take
off
hang
stumped
out
the
cabin
and
they
saw
him
washing
himself
vigorously
the
water
barrel
outside
the
window
Eau
cologne
said
Hermione
amazement
Hagrid
And
what
with
the
hair
and
the
suit
said
Harry
undertone
Look
said
Ron
suddenly
pointing
out
the
window
Hagrid
had
just
straightened
and
turned
round
had
been
blushing
before
was
nothing
what
was
doing
now
Getting
their
feet
very
cautiously
that
Hagrid
wouldn
spot
them
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
peered
through
the
window
and
saw
that
Madame
Maxime
and
the
Beauxbatons
students
had
just
emerged
from
their
carriage
clearly
about
set
off
for
the
feast
too
They
couldn
hear
what
Hagrid
was
saying
but
was
talking
Madame
Maxime
with
rapt
misty
eyed
expression
Harry
had
only
ever
seen
him
wear
once
before
when
had
been
looking
the
baby
dragon
Norbert
going
the
castle
with
her
said
Hermione
indignantly
thought
was
waiting
for
Without
much
backward
glance
his
cabin
Hagrid
was
trudging
off
the
grounds
with
Madame
Maxime
the
Beaux
batons
students
following
their
wake
jogging
keep
with
their
enormous
strides
fancies
her
said
Ron
incredulously
Well
they
end
having
children
they
setting
world
record
bet
any
baby
theirs
would
weigh
about
ton
They
let
themselves
out
the
cabin
and
shut
the
door
behind
them
was
surprisingly
dark
outside
Drawing
their
cloaks
more
closely
around
themselves
they
set
off
the
sloping
lawns
Ooh
them
look
Hermione
whispered
The
Durmstrang
party
was
walking
toward
the
castle
from
the
lake
Viktor
Krum
was
walking
side
side
with
Karkaroff
and
the
other
Durmstrang
students
were
straggling
along
behind
them
Ron
watched
Krum
excitedly
but
Krum
did
not
look
around
reached
the
front
doors
little
ahead
Hermione
Ron
and
Harry
and
proceeded
through
them
When
they
entered
the
candlelit
Great
Hall
was
almost
full
The
Goblet
Fire
had
been
moved
was
now
standing
front
Dumbledore
empty
chair
the
teachers
table
Fred
and
George
clean
shaven
again
seemed
have
taken
their
disappointment
fairly
well
Hope
Angelina
said
Fred
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
down
said
Hermione
breathlessly
Well
soon
know
The
Halloween
feast
seemed
take
much
longer
than
usual
Perhaps
because
was
their
second
feast
two
days
Harry
didn
seem
fancy
the
extravagantly
prepared
food
much
would
have
normally
Like
everyone
else
the
Hall
judging
the
constantly
craning
necks
the
impatient
expressions
every
face
the
fidgeting
and
the
standing
see
whether
Dumbledore
had
finished
eating
yet
Harry
simply
wanted
the
plates
clear
and
hear
who
had
been
selected
champions
long
last
the
golden
plates
returned
their
original
spotless
state
there
was
sharp
upswing
the
level
noise
within
the
Hall
which
died
away
almost
instantly
Dumbledore
got
his
feet
either
side
him
Professor
Karkaroff
and
Madame
Maxime
looked
tense
and
expectant
anyone
Ludo
Bagman
was
beaming
and
winking
various
students
Crouch
however
looked
quite
uninterested
almost
bored
Well
the
goblet
almost
ready
make
its
decision
said
Dumbledore
estimate
that
requires
one
more
minute
Now
when
the
champions
names
are
called
would
ask
them
please
come
the
top
the
Hall
walk
along
the
staff
table
and
through
into
the
next
chamber
indicated
the
door
behind
the
staff
table
where
they
will
receiving
their
first
instructions
took
out
his
wand
and
gave
great
sweeping
wave
with
once
all
the
candles
except
those
inside
the
carved
pumpkins
were
extinguished
plunging
them
into
state
semidarkness
The
Goblet
Fire
now
shone
more
brightly
than
anything
the
whole
Hall
the
sparkling
bright
bluey
whiteness
the
flames
almost
painful
the
eyes
Everyone
watched
waiting
few
people
kept
checking
their
watches
Any
second
Lee
Jordan
whispered
two
seats
away
from
Harry
The
flames
inside
the
goblet
turned
suddenly
red
again
Sparks
began
fly
from
Next
moment
tongue
flame
shot
into
the
air
charred
piece
parchment
fluttered
out
the
whole
room
gasped
Dumbledore
caught
the
piece
parchment
and
held
arm
length
that
could
read
the
light
the
flames
which
had
turned
back
blue
white
The
champion
for
Durmstrang
read
strong
clear
voice
will
Viktor
Krum
surprises
there
yelled
Ron
storm
applause
and
cheering
swept
the
Hall
Harry
saw
Viktor
Krum
rise
from
the
Slytherin
table
and
slouch
toward
Dumbledore
turned
right
walked
along
the
staff
table
and
disappeared
through
the
door
into
the
next
chamber
Bravo
Viktor
boomed
Karkaroff
loudly
that
everyone
could
hear
him
even
over
all
the
applause
Knew
you
had
you
The
clapping
and
chatting
died
down
Now
everyone
attention
was
focused
again
the
goblet
which
seconds
later
turned
red
once
more
second
piece
parchment
shot
out
propelled
the
flames
The
champion
for
Beauxbatons
said
Dumbledore
Fleur
Delacour
her
Ron
Harry
shouted
the
girl
who
resembled
veela
got
gracefully
her
feet
shook
back
her
sheet
silvery
blonde
hair
and
swept
between
the
Ravenclaw
and
Hufflepuff
tables
look
they
all
disappointed
Hermione
said
over
the
noise
nodding
toward
the
remainder
the
Beauxbatons
party
Disappointed
was
bit
understatement
Harry
thought
Two
the
girls
who
had
not
been
selected
had
dissolved
into
tears
and
were
sobbing
with
their
heads
their
arms
When
Fleur
Delacour
too
had
vanished
into
the
side
chamber
silence
fell
again
but
this
time
was
silence
stiff
with
excitement
you
could
almost
taste
The
Hogwarts
champion
next
And
the
Goblet
Fire
turned
red
once
more
sparks
showered
out
the
tongue
flame
shot
high
into
the
air
and
from
its
tip
Dumbledore
pulled
the
third
piece
parchment
The
Hogwarts
champion
called
Cedric
Diggory
said
Ron
loudly
but
nobody
heard
him
except
Harry
the
uproar
from
the
next
table
was
too
great
Every
single
Hufflepuff
had
jumped
his
her
feet
screaming
and
stamping
Cedric
made
his
way
past
them
grinning
broadly
and
headed
off
toward
the
chamber
behind
the
teachers
table
Indeed
the
applause
for
Cedric
went
long
that
was
some
time
before
Dumbledore
could
make
himself
heard
again
Excellent
Dumbledore
called
happily
last
the
tumult
died
down
Well
now
have
our
three
champions
sure
can
count
upon
all
you
including
the
remaining
students
from
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
give
your
champions
every
ounce
support
you
can
muster
cheering
your
champion
you
will
contribute
very
real
But
Dumbledore
suddenly
stopped
speaking
and
was
apparent
everybody
what
had
distracted
him
The
fire
the
goblet
had
just
turned
red
again
Sparks
were
flying
out
long
flame
shot
suddenly
into
the
air
and
borne
upon
was
another
piece
parchment
Automatically
seemed
Dumbledore
reached
out
long
hand
and
seized
the
parchment
held
out
and
stared
the
name
written
upon
There
was
long
pause
during
which
Dumbledore
stared
the
slip
his
hands
and
everyone
the
room
stared
Dumbledore
And
then
Dumbledore
cleared
his
throat
and
read
out
Harry
Potter
CHAPTER
SEVENTEEN
THE
FOUR
CHAMPIONS
Harry
sat
there
aware
that
every
head
the
Great
Hall
had
turned
look
him
was
stunned
felt
numb
was
surely
dreaming
had
not
heard
correctly
There
was
applause
buzzing
though
angry
bees
was
starting
fill
the
Hall
some
students
were
standing
get
better
look
Harry
sat
frozen
his
seat
the
top
table
Professor
McGonagall
had
got
her
feet
and
swept
past
Ludo
Bagman
and
Professor
Karkaroff
whisper
urgently
Professor
Dumbledore
who
bent
his
ear
toward
her
frowning
slightly
Harry
turned
Ron
and
Hermione
beyond
them
saw
the
long
Gryffindor
table
all
watching
him
openmouthed
didn
put
name
Harry
said
blankly
You
know
didn
Both
them
stared
just
blankly
back
the
top
table
Professor
Dumbledore
had
straightened
nodding
Professor
McGonagall
Harry
Potter
called
again
Harry
here
you
please
Hermione
whispered
giving
Harry
slight
push
Harry
got
his
feet
trod
the
hem
his
robes
and
stumbled
slightly
set
off
the
gap
between
the
Gryffindor
and
Hufflepuff
tables
felt
like
immensely
long
walk
the
top
table
didn
seem
getting
any
nearer
all
and
could
feel
hundreds
and
hundreds
eyes
upon
him
though
each
were
searchlight
The
buzzing
grew
louder
and
louder
After
what
seemed
like
hour
was
right
front
Dumbledore
feeling
the
stares
all
the
teachers
upon
him
Well
through
the
door
Harry
said
Dumbledore
wasn
smiling
Harry
moved
off
along
the
teachers
table
Hagrid
was
seated
right
the
end
did
not
wink
Harry
wave
give
any
his
usual
signs
greeting
looked
completely
astonished
and
stared
Harry
passed
like
everyone
else
Harry
went
through
the
door
out
the
Great
Hall
and
found
himself
smaller
room
lined
with
paintings
witches
and
wizards
handsome
fire
was
roaring
the
fireplace
opposite
him
The
faces
the
portraits
turned
look
him
entered
saw
wizened
witch
flit
out
the
frame
her
picture
and
into
the
one
next
which
contained
wizard
with
walrus
mustache
The
wizened
witch
started
whispering
his
ear
Viktor
Krum
Cedric
Diggory
and
Fleur
Delacour
were
grouped
around
the
fire
They
looked
strangely
impressive
silhouetted
against
the
flames
Krum
hunched
and
brooding
was
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
slightly
apart
from
the
other
two
Cedric
was
standing
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
staring
into
the
fire
Fleur
Delacour
looked
around
when
Harry
walked
and
threw
back
her
sheet
long
silvery
hair
What
she
said
zey
want
back
Hall
She
thought
had
come
deliver
message
Harry
didn
know
how
explain
what
had
just
happened
just
stood
there
looking
the
three
champions
struck
him
how
very
tall
all
them
were
There
was
sound
scurrying
feet
behind
him
and
Ludo
Bagman
entered
the
room
took
Harry
the
arm
and
led
him
forward
Extraordinary
muttered
squeezing
Harry
arm
Absolutely
extraordinary
Gentlemen
lady
added
approaching
the
fireside
and
addressing
the
other
three
May

incredible
though
may
seem
the
fourth
Triwizard
champion
Viktor
Krum
straightened
His
surly
face
darkened
surveyed
Harry
Cedric
looked
nonplussed
looked
from
Bagman
Harry
and
back
again
though
sure
must
have
misheard
what
Bagman
had
said
Fleur
Delacour
however
tossed
her
hair
smiling
and
said
vairy
funny
joke
Meester
Bagman
Joke
Bagman
repeated
bewildered
not

Harry
name
just
came
out
the
Goblet
Fire
Krum
thick
eyebrows
contracted
slightly
Cedric
was
still
looking
politely
bewildered
Fleur
frowned
But
evidently
zair
been
mistake
she
said
contemptuously
Bagman
cannot
compete
too
young
Well
amazing
said
Bagman
rubbing
his
smooth
chin
and
smiling
down
Harry
But

the
age
restriction
was
only
imposed
this
year
extra
safety
measure
And

The
door
behind
them
opened
again
and
large
group
people
came
Professor
Dumbledore
followed
closely
Crouch
Professor
Karkaroff
Madame
Maxime
Professor
McGonagall
and
Professor
Snape
Harry
heard
the
buzzing
the
hundreds
students
the
other
side
the
wall
before
Professor
McGonagall
closed
the
door
Madame
Maxime
said
Fleur
once
striding
over
her
headmistress
Zey

Somewhere
under
Harry
numb
disbelief
felt
ripple
anger
Little
boy
Madame
Maxime
had
drawn
herself
her
full
and
considerable
height
The
top
her
handsome
head
brushed
the
candle
filled
chandelier
and
her
gigantic
black
satin
bosom
swelled
What

Dumbly

said
imperiously

Dumbledore
said
Professor
Karkaroff
was
wearing
steely
smile
and
his
blue
eyes
were
like
chips
ice
Two
Hogwarts

and
nasty

said
Madame
Maxime
whose
enormous
hand
with
its
many
superb
opals
was
resting
upon
Fleur
shoulder
Ogwarts

champions
most
injust
were
under
the
impression
that
your
Age
Line
would
keep
out
younger
contestants
Dumbledore
said
Karkaroff
his
steely
smile
still
place
though
his
eyes
were
colder
than
ever
Otherwise
would
course
have
brought
along
wider
selection
candidates
from
our
own
schools
one
fault
but
Potter
Karkaroff
said
Snape
softly
His
black
eyes
were
alight
with
malice
Don
blaming
Dumbledore
for
Potter
determination
break
rules
has
been
crossing
lines
ever
since
arrived
here
Thank
you
Severus
said
Dumbledore
firmly
and
Snape
went
quiet
though
his
eyes
still
glinted
malevolently
through
his
curtain
greasy
black
hair
Professor
Dumbledore
was
now
looking
down
Harry
who
looked
right
back
him
trying
discern
the
expression
the
eyes
behind
the
half
moon
spectacles
Did
you
put
your
name
into
the
Goblet
Fire
Harry
asked
calmly
said
Harry
was
very
aware
everybody
watching
him
closely
Snape
made
soft
noise
impatient
disbelief
the
shadows
Did
you
ask
older
student
put
into
the
Goblet
Fire
for
you
said
Professor
Dumbledore
ignoring
Snape
said
Harry
vehemently
but
course
lying
cried
Madame
Maxime
Snape
was
now
shaking
his
head
his
lip
curling
could
not
have
crossed
the
Age
Line
said
Professor
McGonagall
sharply
sure
are
all
agreed
that
Dumbly
dorr
must
ave
made
mistake
wiz
line
said
Madame
Maxime
shrugging
possible
course
said
Dumbledore
politely
Dumbledore
you
know
perfectly
well
you
did
not
make
mistake
said
Professor
McGonagall
angrily
Really
what
nonsense
Harry
could
not
have
crossed
the
line
himself
and
Professor
Dumbledore
believes
that
did
not
persuade
older
student
for
him
sure
that
should
good
enough
for
everybody
else
She
shot
very
angry
look
Professor
Snape
Crouch
Bagman
said
Karkaroff
his
voice
unctuous
once
more
you
are
our
objective
judges
Surely
you
will
agree
that
this
most
irregular
Bagman
wiped
his
round
boyish
face
with
his
handkerchief
and
looked
Crouch
who
was
standing
outside
the
circle
the
firelight
his
face
half
hidden
shadow
looked
slightly
eerie
the
half
darkness
making
him
look
much
older
giving
him
almost
skull
like
appearance
When
spoke
however
was
his
usual
curt
voice
must
follow
the
rules
and
the
rules
state
clearly
that
those
people
whose
names
come
out
the
Goblet
Fire
are
bound
compete
the
tournament
Well
Barty
knows
the
rule
book
back
front
said
Bagman
beaming
and
turning
back
Karkaroff
and
Madame
Maxime
though
the
matter
was
now
closed
insist
upon
resubmitting
the
names
the
rest
students
said
Karkaroff
had
dropped
his
unctuous
tone
and
his
smile
now
His
face
wore
very
ugly
look
indeed
You
will
set
the
Goblet
Fire
once
more
and
will
continue
adding
names
until
each
school
has
two
champions
only
fair
Dumbledore
But
Karkaroff
doesn
work
like
that
said
Bagman
The
Goblet
Fire
just
gone
out
won
reignite
until
the
start
the
next
tournament
which
Durmstrang
will
most
certainly
not
competing
exploded
Karkaroff
After
all
our
meetings
and
negotiations
and
compromises
little
expected
something
this
nature
occur
have
half
mind
leave
now
Empty
threat
Karkaroff
growled
voice
from
near
the
door
You
can
leave
your
champion
now
got
compete
They
all
got
compete
Binding
magical
contract
like
Dumbledore
said
Convenient
Moody
had
just
entered
the
room
limped
toward
the
fire
and
with
every
right
step
took
there
was
loud
clunk
Convenient
said
Karkaroff
afraid
don
understand
you
Moody
Harry
could
tell
was
trying
sound
disdainful
though
what
Moody
was
saying
was
barely
worth
his
notice
but
his
hands
gave
him
away
they
had
balled
themselves
into
fists
Don
you
said
Moody
quietly
very
simple
Karkaroff
Someone
put
Potter
name
that
goblet
knowing
have
compete
came
out
Evidently
someone
wished
give
Ogwarts
two
bites
apple
said
Madame
Maxime
quite
agree
Madame
Maxime
said
Karkaroff
bowing
her
shall
lodging
complaints
with
the
Ministry
Magic
and
the
International
Confederation
Wizards
anyone
got
reason
complain
Potter
growled
Moody
but
funny
thing
don
hear
him
saying
word
Why
should
complain
burst
out
Fleur
Delacour
stamping
her
foot
chance

asn
ave
all
been
oping
chosen
for

and

thousand
Galleons

zis

many
would
die
for
Maybe
someone
hoping
Potter
going
die
for
said
Moody
with
the
merest
trace
growl
extremely
tense
silence
followed
these
words
Ludo
Bagman
who
was
looking
very
anxious
indeed
bounced
nervously
and
down
his
feet
and
said
Moody
old
man
what
thing
say
all
know
Professor
Moody
considers
the
morning
wasted
hasn
discovered
six
plots
murder
him
before
lunchtime
said
Karkaroff
loudly
Apparently
now
teaching
his
students
fear
assassination
too
odd
quality
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
Dumbledore
but
doubt
you
had
your
reasons
Imagining
things
growled
Moody
Seeing
things
was
skilled
witch
wizard
who
put
the
boy
name
that
goblet
what
evidence
zere
zat
said
Madame
Maxime
throwing
her
huge
hands
Because
they
hoodwinked
very
powerful
magical
object
said
Moody
would
have
needed
exceptionally
strong
Confundus
Charm
bamboozle
that
goblet
into
forgetting
that
only
three
schools
compete
the
tournament
guessing
they
submitted
Potter
name
under
fourth
school
make
sure
was
the
only
one
his
category
You
seem
have
given
this
great
deal
thought
Moody
said
Karkaroff
coldly
and
very
ingenious
theory
though
course
heard
you
recently
got
into
your
head
that
one
your
birthday
presents
contained
cunningly
disguised
basilisk
egg
and
smashed
pieces
before
realizing
was
carriage
clock
you
understand
don
take
you
entirely
seriously
There
are
those
who
turn
innocent
occasions
their
advantage
Moody
retorted
menacing
voice
job
think
the
way
Dark
wizards
Karkaroff
you
ought
remember
Alastor
said
Dumbledore
warningly
Harry
wondered
for
moment
whom
was
speaking
but
then
realized
Mad
Eye
could
hardly
Moody
real
first
name
Moody
fell
silent
though
still
surveying
Karkaroff
with
satisfaction
Karkaroff
face
was
burning
How
this
situation
arose
not
know
said
Dumbledore
speaking
everyone
gathered
the
room
seems
however
that
have
choice
but
accept
Both
Cedric
and
Harry
have
been
chosen
compete
the
Tournament
This
therefore
they
will
but
Dumbly
dorr
dear
Madame
Maxime
you
have
alternative
would
delighted
hear
Dumbledore
waited
but
Madame
Maxime
did
not
speak
she
merely
glared
She
wasn
the
only
one
either
Snape
looked
furious
Karkaroff
livid
Bagman
however
looked
rather
excited
Well
shall
crack
then
said
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
smiling
around
the
room
Got
give
our
champions
their
instructions
haven
Barty
want
the
honors
Crouch
seemed
come
out
deep
reverie
Yes
said
instructions
Yes
the
first
task
moved
forward
into
the
firelight
Close
Harry
thought
looked
ill
There
were
dark
shadows
beneath
his
eyes
and
thin
papery
look
about
his
wrinkled
skin
that
had
not
been
there
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
The
first
task
designed
test
your
daring
told
Harry
Cedric
Fleur
and
Viktor
are
not
going
telling
you
what
Courage
the
face
the
unknown
important
quality
wizard
very
important
The
first
task
will
take
place
November
the
twenty
fourth
front
the
other
students
and
the
panel
judges
The
champions
are
not
permitted
ask
for
accept
help
any
kind
from
their
teachers
complete
the
tasks
the
tournament
The
champions
will
face
the
first
challenge
armed
only
with
their
wands
They
will
receive
information
about
the
second
task
when
the
first
over
Owing
the
demanding
and
time
consuming
nature
the
tournament
the
champions
are
exempted
from
end
year
tests
Crouch
turned
look
Dumbledore
think
that
all
Albus
think
said
Dumbledore
who
was
looking
Crouch
with
mild
concern
Are
you
sure
you
wouldn
like
stay
Hogwarts
tonight
Barty
Dumbledore
must
get
back
the
Ministry
said
Crouch
very
busy
very
difficult
time
the
moment
left
young
Weatherby
charge
Very
enthusiastic
little
overenthusiastic
truth
told
You
come
and
have
drink
before
you
least
said
Dumbledore
Come
Barry
staying
said
Bagman
brightly
all
happening
Hogwarts
now
you
know
much
more
exciting
here
than
the
office
think
not
Ludo
said
Crouch
with
touch
his
old
impatience
Professor
Karkaroff
Madame
Maxime
nightcap
said
Dumbledore
But
Madame
Maxime
had
already
put
her
arm
around
Fleur
shoulders
and
was
leading
her
swiftly
out
the
room
Harry
could
hear
them
both
talking
very
fast
French
they
went
off
into
the
Great
Hall
Karkaroff
beckoned
Krum
and
they
too
exited
though
silence
Harry
Cedric
suggest
you
bed
said
Dumbledore
smiling
both
them
sure
Gryffindor
and
Hufflepuff
are
waiting
celebrate
with
you
and
would
shame
deprive
them
this
excellent
excuse
make
great
deal
mess
and
noise
Harry
glanced
Cedric
who
nodded
and
they
left
together
The
Great
Hall
was
deserted
now
the
candles
had
burned
low
giving
the
jagged
smiles
the
pumpkins
eerie
flickering
quality
said
Cedric
with
slight
smile
playing
against
each
other
again
pose
said
Harry
really
couldn
think
anything
say
The
inside
his
head
seemed
complete
disarray
though
his
brain
had
been
ransacked
tell
said
Cedric
they
reached
the
entrance
hall
which
was
now
lit
only
torches
the
absence
the
Goblet
Fire
How
did
you
get
your
name
didn
said
Harry
staring
him
didn
put
was
telling
the
truth
okay
said
Cedric
Harry
could
tell
Cedric
didn
believe
him
Well
see
you
then
Instead
going
the
marble
staircase
Cedric
headed
for
door
its
right
Harry
stood
listening
him
going
down
the
stone
steps
beyond
then
slowly
started
climb
the
marble
ones
Was
anyone
except
Ron
and
Hermione
going
believe
him
would
they
all
think
put
himself
for
the
tournament
Yet
how
could
anyone
think
that
when
was
facing
competitors
who
had
three
years
more
magical
education
than
had
when
was
now
facing
tasks
that
not
only
sounded
very
dangerous
but
which
were
performed
front
hundreds
people
Yes
thought
about
fantasized
about
but
had
been
joke
really
idle
sort
dream
never
really
seriously
considered
entering
But
someone
else
had
considered
someone
else
had
wanted
him
the
tournament
and
had
made
sure
was
entered
Why
give
him
treat
didn
think
somehow
see
him
make
fool
himself
Well
they
were
likely
get
their
wish
But
get
him
killed
Was
Moody
just
being
his
usual
paranoid
self
Couldn
someone
have
put
Harry
name
the
goblet
trick
practical
joke
Did
anyone
really
want
him
dead
Harry
was
able
answer
that
once
Yes
someone
wanted
him
dead
someone
had
wanted
him
dead
ever
since
had
been
year
old
Lord
Voldemort
But
how
could
Voldemort
have
ensured
that
Harry
name
got
into
the
Goblet
Fire
Voldemort
was
supposed
far
away
some
distant
country
hiding
alone
feeble
and
powerless
Yet
that
dream
had
had
just
before
had
awoken
with
his
scar
hurting
Voldemort
had
not
been
alone
had
been
talking
Wormtail
plotting
Harry
murder
Harry
got
shock
find
himself
facing
the
Fat
Lady
already
had
barely
noticed
where
his
feet
were
carrying
him
was
also
surprise
see
that
she
was
not
alone
her
frame
The
wizened
witch
who
had
flitted
into
her
neighbor
painting
when
had
joined
the
champions
downstairs
was
now
sitting
smugly
beside
the
Fat
Lady
She
must
have
dashed
through
every
picture
lining
seven
staircases
reach
here
before
him
Both
she
and
the
Fat
Lady
were
looking
down
him
with
the
keenest
interest
Well
well
well
said
the
Fat
Lady
Violet
just
told
everything
Who
just
been
chosen
school
champion
then
Balderdash
said
Harry
dully
most
certainly
isn
said
the
pale
witch
indignantly
the
password
said
the
Fat
Lady
soothingly
and
she
swung
forward
her
hinges
let
Harry
into
the
common
room
The
blast
noise
that
met
Harry
ears
when
the
portrait
opened
almost
knocked
him
backward
Next
thing
knew
was
being
wrenched
inside
the
common
room
about
dozen
pairs
hands
and
was
facing
the
whole
Gryffindor
House
all
whom
were
screaming
applauding
and
whistling
You
should
told
you
entered
bellowed
Fred
looked
half
annoyed
half
deeply
impressed
How
did
you
without
getting
beard
Brilliant
roared
George
didn
Harry
said
don
know
how
But
Angelina
had
now
swooped
down
upon
him
couldn
least
Gryffindor
You
able
pay
back
Diggory
for
that
last
Quidditch
match
Harry
shrieked
Katie
Bell
another
the
Gryffindor
Chasers
got
food
Harry
come
and
have
some
not
hungry
had
enough
the
feast
But
nobody
wanted
hear
that
wasn
hungry
nobody
wanted
hear
that
hadn
put
his
name
the
goblet
not
one
single
person
seemed
have
noticed
that
wasn
all
the
mood
celebrate
Lee
Jordan
had
unearthed
Gryffindor
banner
from
somewhere
and
insisted
draping
around
Harry
like
cloak
Harry
couldn
get
away
whenever
tried
sidle
over
the
staircase
the
dormitories
the
crowd
around
him
closed
ranks
forcing
another
butterbeer
him
stuffing
crisps
and
peanuts
into
his
hands
Everyone
wanted
know
how
had
done
how
had
tricked
Dumbledore
Age
Line
and
managed
get
his
name
into
the
goblet
didn
said
over
and
over
again
don
know
how
happened
But
for
all
the
notice
anyone
took
might
just
well
not
have
answered
all
tired
bellowed
finally
after
nearly
half
hour
seriously
George
going
bed
wanted
more
than
anything
find
Ron
and
Hermione
find
bit
sanity
but
neither
them
seemed
the
common
room
Insisting
that
needed
sleep
and
almost
flattening
the
little
Creevey
brothers
they
attempted
waylay
him
the
foot
the
stairs
Harry
managed
shake
everyone
off
and
climb
the
dormitory
fast
could
his
great
relief
found
Ron
was
lying
his
bed
the
otherwise
empty
dormitory
still
fully
dressed
looked
when
Harry
slammed
the
door
behind
him
Where
you
been
Harry
said
hello
said
Ron
was
grinning
but
was
very
odd
strained
sort
grin
Harry
suddenly
became
aware
that
was
still
wearing
the
scarlet
Gryffindor
banner
that
Lee
had
tied
around
him
hastened
take
off
but
was
knotted
very
tightly
Ron
lay
the
bed
without
moving
watching
Harry
struggle
remove
said
when
Harry
had
finally
removed
the
banner
and
thrown
into
corner
Congratulations
What
you
mean
congratulations
said
Harry
staring
Ron
There
was
definitely
something
wrong
with
the
way
Ron
was
smiling
was
more
like
grimace
Well
one
else
got
across
the
Age
Line
said
Ron
Not
even
Fred
and
George
What
did
you
use
the
Invisibility
Cloak
The
Invisibility
Cloak
wouldn
have
got
over
that
line
said
Harry
slowly
right
said
Ron
thought
you
might
told
was
the
cloak
because
would
covered
both
wouldn
But
you
found
another
way
did
you
Listen
said
Harry
didn
put
name
that
goblet
Someone
else
must
done
Ron
raised
his
eyebrows
What
would
they
that
for
dunno
said
Harry
felt
would
sound
very
melodramatic
say
kill
Ron
eyebrows
rose
high
that
they
were
danger
disappearing
into
his
hair
okay
you
know
you
can
tell
the
truth
said
you
don
want
everyone
else
know
fine
but
don
know
why
you
bothering
lie
you
didn
get
into
trouble
for
did
you
That
friend
the
Fat
Lady
that
Violet
she
already
told
all
Dumbledore
letting
you
enter
thousand
Galleons
prize
money
And
you
don
have
end
year
tests
either
didn
put
name
that
goblet
said
Harry
starting
feel
angry
Yeah
okay
said
Ron
exactly
the
same
sceptical
tone
Cedric
Only
you
said
this
morning
you
have
done
last
night
and
one
would
seen
you
not
stupid
you
know
You
doing
really
good
impression
Harry
snapped
Yeah
said
Ron
and
there
was
trace
grin
forced
otherwise
his
face
now
You
want
get
bed
Harry
expect
you
need
early
tomorrow
for
photo
call
something
wrenched
the
hangings
shut
around
his
four
poster
leaving
Harry
standing
there
the
door
staring
the
dark
red
velvet
curtains
now
hiding
one
the
few
people
had
been
sure
would
believe
him
CHAPTER
EIGHTEEN
THE
WEIGHING
THE
WANDS
When
Harry
woke
Sunday
morning
took
him
moment
remember
why
felt
miserable
and
worried
Then
the
memory
the
previous
night
rolled
over
him
sat
and
ripped
back
the
curtains
his
own
four
poster
intending
talk
Ron
force
Ron
believe
him
only
find
that
Ron
bed
was
empty
had
obviously
gone
down
breakfast
Harry
dressed
and
went
down
the
spiral
staircase
into
the
common
room
The
moment
appeared
the
people
who
had
already
finished
breakfast
broke
into
applause
again
The
prospect
going
down
into
the
Great
Hall
and
facing
the
rest
the
Gryffindors
all
treating
him
like
some
sort
hero
was
not
inviting
was
that
however
stay
here
and
allow
himself
cornered
the
Creevey
brothers
who
were
both
beckoning
frantically
him
join
them
walked
resolutely
over
the
portrait
hole
pushed
open
climbed
out
and
found
himself
face
face
with
Hermione
Hello
she
said
holding
stack
toast
which
she
was
carrying
napkin
brought
you
this
Want
for
walk
Good
idea
said
Harry
gratefully
They
went
downstairs
crossed
the
entrance
hall
quickly
without
looking
the
Great
Hall
and
were
soon
striding
across
the
lawn
toward
the
lake
where
the
Durmstrang
ship
was
moored
reflected
blackly
the
water
was
chilly
morning
and
they
kept
moving
munching
their
toast
Harry
told
Hermione
exactly
what
had
happened
after
had
left
the
Gryffindor
table
the
night
before
his
immense
relief
Hermione
accepted
his
story
without
question
Well
course
knew
you
hadn
entered
yourself
she
said
when
finished
telling
her
about
the
scene
the
chamber
off
the
Hall
The
look
your
face
when
Dumbledore
read
out
your
name
But
the
question
who
did
put
Because
Moody
right
Harry
don
think
any
student
could
have
done
they
never
able
fool
the
Goblet
get
over
Dumbledore
Have
you
seen
Ron
Harry
interrupted
Hermione
hesitated
Erm
yes
was
breakfast
she
said
Does
still
think
entered
myself
Well
don
think
not
really
said
Hermione
awkwardly
What
that
supposed
mean
not
really
Harry
isn
obvious
Hermione
said
despairingly
jealous
Jealous
Harry
said
incredulously
Jealous
what
wants
make
prat
himself
front
the
whole
school
does
Look
said
Hermione
patiently
always
you
who
gets
all
the
attention
you
know
know
not
your
fault
she
added
quickly
seeing
Harry
open
his
mouth
furiously
know
you
don
ask
for
but
well
you
know
Ron
got
all
those
brothers
compete
against
home
and
you
his
best
friend
and
you
really
famous
always
shunted
one
side
whenever
people
see
you
and
puts
with
and
never
mentions
but
suppose
this
just
one
time
too
many
Great
said
Harry
bitterly
Really
great
Tell
him
from
swap
any
time
wants
Tell
him
from
welcome
People
gawping
forehead
everywhere
not
teiling
him
anything
Hermione
said
shortly
Tell
him
yourself
the
only
way
sort
this
out
not
running
around
after
him
trying
make
him
grow
Harry
said
loudly
that
several
owls
nearby
tree
took
flight
alarm
Maybe
believe
not
enjoying
myself
once
got
neck
broken
That
not
funny
said
Hermione
quietly
That
not
funny
all
She
looked
extremely
anxious
Harry
been
thinking
you
know
what
got
don
you
Straight
away
the
moment
get
back
the
castle
Yeah
give
Ron
good
kick
the
Write

You

everything
that
going
Hogwarts
almost
expected
something
like
this

brought
some
parchment
and
quill
out
with
Come

said
Harry
looking
around
check
that
they
couldn
overheard
but
the
grounds
were
quite
deserted
came
back
the
country
just
because
scar
twinged
probably

bursting
right
into
the
castle
tell

Triwizard
Tournament

said
Hermione
sternly
going
find
out
anyway
How
Harry
this
isn
going
kept
quiet
said
Hermione
very
seriously
This
tournament
famous
and
you
famous
really
surprised
there
isn
anything
the
Daily
Prophet
about
you
competing
You

half
the
books
about
You
Know
Who
you
know
and
Sirius
would
rather
hear
from
you
know
would
Okay
okay
write
him
said
Harry
throwing
his
last
piece
toast
into
the
lake
They
both
stood
and
watched
floating
there
for
moment
before
large
tentacle
rose
out
the
water
and
scooped
beneath
the
surface
Then
they
returned
the
castle
Whose
owl
going
use
Harry
said
they
climbed
the
stairs
told
not
use
Hedwig
again
Ask
Ron
you
can
borrow
not
asking
Ron
for
anything
Harry
said
flatly
Well
borrow
one
the
school
owls
then
anyone
can
use
them
said
Hermione
They
went
the
Owlery
Hermione
gave
Harry
piece
parchment
quill
and
bottle
ink
then
strolled
around
the
long
lines
perches
looking
all
the
different
owls
while
Harry
sat
down
against
wall
and
wrote
his
letter
Dear
Sirius
You
told
keep
you
posted
what
happening
Hogwarts
here
goes
don
know
you
heard
but
the
Triwizard
Tournament
happening
this
year
and
Saturday
night
got
picked
fourth
champion
don
who
put
name
the
Goblet
Fire
because
didn
The
other
Hogwarts
champion
Cedric
Diggory
from
Hufflepuff
paused
this
point
thinking
had
urge
say
something
about
the
large
weight
anxiety
that
seemed
have
settled
inside
his
chest
since
last
night
but
couldn
think
how
translate
this
into
words
simply
dipped
his
quill
back
into
the
ink
bottle
and
wrote
Hope
you
okay
and
Buckbeak
Harry
Finished
told
Hermione
getting
his
feet
and
brushing
straw
off
his
robes
this
Hedwig
fluttered
down
onto
his
shoulder
and
held
out
her
leg
can
use
you
Harry
told
her
looking
around
for
the
school
owls
got
use
one
these
Hedwig
gave
very
loud
hoot
and
took
off
suddenly
that
her
talons
cut
into
his
shoulder
She
kept
her
back
Harry
all
the
time
was
tying
his
letter
the
leg
large
barn
owl
When
the
barn
owl
had
flown
off
Harry
reached
out
stroke
Hedwig
but
she
clicked
her
beak
furiously
and
soared
into
the
rafters
out
reach
First
Ron
then
you
Harry
said
angrily
This
isn
fault
Harry
had
thought
that
matters
would
improve
once
everyone
got
used
the
idea
him
being
champion
the
following
day
showed
him
how
mistaken
was
could
longer
avoid
the
rest
the
school
once
was
back
lessons
and
was
clear
that
the
rest
the
school
just
like
the
Gryffindors
thought
Harry
had
entered
himself
for
the
tournament
Unlike
the
Gryffindors
however
they
did
not
seem
impressed
The
Hufflepuffs
who
were
usually
excellent
terms
with
the
Gryffindors
had
turned
remarkably
cold
toward
the
whole
lot
them
One
Herbology
lesson
was
enough
demonstrate
this
was
plain
that
the
Hufflepuffs
felt
that
Harry
had
stolen
their
champion
glory
feeling
exacerbated
perhaps
the
fact
that
Hufflepuff
House
very
rarely
got
any
glory
and
that
Cedric
was
one
the
few
who
had
ever
given
them
any
having
beaten
Gryffindor
once
Quidditch
Ernie
Macmillan
and
Justin
FinchFletchley
with
whom
Harry
normally
got
very
well
did
not
talk
him
even
though
they
were
repotting
Bouncing
Bulbs
the
same
tray
though
they
did
laugh
rather
unpleasantly
when
one
the
Bouncing
Bulbs
wriggled
free
from
Harry
grip
and
smacked
him
hard
the
face
Ron
wasn
talking
Harry
either
Hermione
sat
between
them
making
very
forced
conversation
but
though
both
answered
her
normally
they
avoided
making
eye
contact
with
each
other
Harry
thought
even
Professor
Sprout
seemed
distant
with
him
but
then
she
was
Head
Hufflepuff
House
would
have
been
looking
forward
seeing
Hagrid
under
normal
circumstances
but
Care
Magical
Creatures
meant
seeing
the
Slytherins
too
the
first
time
would
come
face
face
with
them
since
becoming
champion
Predictably
Malfoy
arrived
Hagrid
cabin
with
his
familiar
sneer
firmly
place
look
boys
the
champion
said
Crabbe
and
Goyle
the
moment
got
within
earshot
Harry
Got
your
autograph
books
Better
get
signature
now
because
doubt
going
around
much
longer
Half
the
Triwizard
champions
have
died
how
long
you
reckon
you
going
last
Potter
Ten
minutes
into
the
first
task
bet
Crabbe
and
Goyle
guffawed
sycophantically
but
Malfoy
had
stop
there
because
Hagrid
emerged
from
the
back
his
cabin
balancing
teetering
tower
crates
each
containing
very
large
Blast
Ended
Skrewt
the
class
horror
Hagrid
proceeded
explain
that
the
reason
the
skrewts
had
been
killing
one
another
was
excess
pent
energy
and
that
the
solution
would
for
each
student
fix
leash
skrewt
and
take
for
short
walk
The
only
good
thing
about
this
plan
was
that
distracted
Malfoy
completely
Take
this
thing
for
walk
repeated
disgust
staring
into
one
the
boxes
And
where
exactly
are
supposed
fix
the
leash
Around
the
sting
the
blasting
end
the
sucker
Roun
the
middle
said
Hagrid
demonstrating
yeh
might
want
ter
put
yer
dragon
hide
gloves
jus
extra
precaution
like
Harry
you
come
here
help
with
this
big
one
Hagrid
real
intention
however
was
totalk
Harry
away
from
the
rest
the
class
waited
until
everyone
else
had
set
off
with
their
skrewts
then
turned
Harry
and
said
very
seriously
yer
competin
Harry
the
tournament
School
champion
One
the
champions
Harry
corrected
him
Hagrid
beetle
black
eyes
looked
very
anxious
under
his
wild
eyebrows
idea
who
put
yeh
fer
Harry
You
believe
didn
then
said
Harry
concealing
with
difficulty
the
rush
gratitude
felt
Hagrid
words
Course
Hagrid
grunted
Yeh
say
wasn
you
believe
yeh
Dumbledore
believes
yer
all
Wish
knew
who
did
said
Harry
bitterly
The
pair
them
looked
out
over
the
lawn
the
class
was
widely
scattered
now
and
all
great
difficulty
The
skrewts
were
now
over
three
feet
long
and
extremely
powerful
longer
shell
less
and
colorless
they
had
developed
kind
thick
grayish
shiny
armor
They
looked
like
cross
between
giant
scorpions
and
elongated
crabs
but
still
without
recognizable
heads
eyes
They
had
become
immensely
strong
and
very
hard
control
Look
like
they
havin
fun
don
they
Hagrid
said
happily
Harry
assumed
was
talking
about
the
skrewts
because
his
classmates
certainly
weren
every
now
and
then
with
alarming
bang
one
the
skrewts
ends
would
explode
causing
shoot
forward
several
yards
and
more
than
one
person
was
being
dragged
along
their
stomach
trying
desperately
get
back
their
feet
don
know
Harry
Hagrid
sighed
suddenly
looking
back
down
him
with
worried
expression
his
face
School
champion
everythin
seems
ter
happen
ter
you
doesn
Harry
didn
answer
Yes
everything
did
seem
happen
him
that
was
more
less
what
Hermione
had
said
they
had
walked
around
the
lake
and
that
was
the
reason
according
her
that
Ron
was
longer
talking
him
The
next
few
days
were
some
Harry
worst
Hogwarts
The
closest
had
ever
come
feeling
like
this
had
been
during
those
months
his
second
year
when
large
part
the
school
had
suspected
him
attacking
his
fellow
students
But
Ron
had
been
his
side
then
thought
could
have
coped
with
the
rest
the
school
behavior
could
just
have
had
Ron
back
friend
but
wasn
going
try
and
persuade
Ron
talk
him
Ron
didn
want
Nevertheless
was
lonely
with
dislike
pouring
him
from
all
sides
could
understand
the
Hufflepuffs
attitude
even
didn
like
they
had
their
own
champion
support
expected
nothing
less
than
vicious
insults
from
the
Slytherins
was
highly
unpopular
there
and
always
had
been
because
had
helped
Gryffindor
beat
them
often
both
Quidditch
and
the
Inter
House
Championship
But
had
hoped
the
Ravenclaws
might
have
found
their
hearts
support
him
much
Cedric
was
wrong
however
Most
Ravenclaws
seemed
think
that
had
been
desperate
earn
himself
bit
more
fame
tricking
the
goblet
into
accepting
his
name
Then
there
was
the
fact
that
Cedric
looked
the
part
champion
much
more
than
did
Exceptionally
handsome
with
his
straight
nose
dark
hair
and
gray
eyes
was
hard
say
who
was
receiving
more
admiration
these
days
Cedric
Viktor
Krum
Harry
actually
saw
the
same
sixth
year
girls
who
had
been
keen
get
Krum
autograph
begging
Cedric
sign
their
school
bags
one
lunchtime
Meanwhile
there
was
reply
from
Sirius
Hedwig
was
refusing
come
anywhere
near
him
Professor
Trelawney
was
predicting
his
death
with
even
more
certainty
than
usual
and
did
badly
Summoning
Charms
Professor
Flitwick
class
that
was
given
extra
homework
the
only
person
get
any
apart
from
Neville
really
not
that
difficult
Harry
Hermione
tried
reassure
him
they
left
Flitwick
class
she
had
been
making
objects
zoom
across
the
room
her
all
lesson
though
she
were
some
sort
weird
magnet
for
board
dusters
wastepaper
baskets
and
lunascopes
You
just
weren
concentrating
properly
Wonder
why
that
was
said
Harry
darkly
Cedric
Diggory
walked
past
surrounded
large
group
simpering
girls
all
whom
looked
Harry
though
were
particularly
large
Blast
Ended
Skrewt
Still
never
mind
Double
Potions
look
forward
this
afternoon
Double
Potions
was
always
horrible
experience
but
these
days
was
nothing
short
torture
Being
shut
dungeon
for
hour
and
half
with
Snape
and
the
Slytherins
all
whom
seemed
determined
punish
Harry
much
possible
for
daring
become
school
champion
was
about
the
most
unpleasant
thing
Harry
could
imagine
had
already
struggled
through
one
Friday
worth
with
Hermione
sitting
next
him
intoning
ignore
them
ignore
them
ignore
them
under
her
breath
and
couldn
see
why
today
should
any
better
When
and
Hermione
arrived
Snape
dungeon
after
lunch
they
found
the
Slytherins
waiting
outside
each
and
every
one
them
wearing
large
badge
the
front
his
her
robes
For
one
wild
moment
Harry
thought
they
were
badges
then
saw
that
they
all
bore
the
same
message
luminous
red
letters
that
burnt
brightly
the
dimly
lit
underground
passage
SUPPORT
CEDRIC
DIGGORY
THE
REAL
HOGWARTS
CHAMPION
Like
them
Potter
said
Malfoy
loudly
Harry
approached
And
this
isn
all
they
look
pressed
his
badge
into
his
chest
and
the
message
upon
vanished
replaced
another
one
which
glowed
green
POTTER
STINKS
The
Slytherins
howled
with
laughter
Each
them
pressed
their
badges
too
until
the
message
POTTER
STINKS
was
shining
brightly
all
around
Harry
felt
the
heat
rise
his
face
and
neck
very
funny
Hermione
said
sarcastically
Pansy
Parkinson
and
her
gang
Slytherin
girls
who
were
laughing
harder
than
anyone
really
witty
Ron
was
standing
against
the
wall
with
Dean
and
Seamus
wasn
laughing
but
wasn
sticking
for
Harry
either
Want
one
Granger
said
Malfoy
holding
out
badge
Hermione
got
loads
But
don
touch
hand
now
just
washed
you
see
don
want
Mudblood
sliming
Some
the
anger
Harry
had
been
feeling
for
days
and
days
seemed
burst
through
dam
his
chest
had
reached
for
his
wand
before
thought
what
was
doing
People
all
around
them
scrambled
out
the
way
backing
down
the
corridor
Harry
Hermione
said
warningly
then
Potter
Malfoy
said
quietly
drawing
out
his
own
wand
Moody
not
here
look
after
you
now
you
got
the
guts
For
split
second
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
then
exactly
the
same
time
both
acted
Funnunculus
Harry
yelled
Densaugeo
screamed
Malfoy
Jets
light
shot
from
both
wands
hit
each
other
midair
and
ricocheted
off
angles
Harry
hit
Goyle
the
face
and
Malfoy
hit
Hermione
Goyle
bellowed
and
put
his
hands
his
nose
where
great
ugly
boils
were
springing
Hermione
whimpering
panic
was
clutching
her
mouth
Hermione
Ron
had
hurried
forward
see
what
was
wrong
with
her
Harry
turned
and
saw
Ron
dragging
Hermione
hand
away
from
her
face
wasn
pretty
sight
Hermione
front
teeth
already
larger
than
average
were
now
growing
alarming
rate
she
was
looking
more
and
more
like
beaver
her
teeth
elongated
past
her
bottom
lip
toward
her
chin
panic
stricken
she
felt
them
and
let
out
terrified
cry
And
what
all
this
noise
about
said
soft
deadly
voice
Snape
had
arrived
The
Slytherins
clamored
give
their
explanations
Snape
pointed
long
yellow
finger
Malfoy
and
said
Explain
Potter
attacked
sir
attacked
each
other
the
same
time
Harry
shouted
and
hit
Goyle
look
Snape
examined
Goyle
whose
face
now
resembled
something
that
would
have
been
home
book
poisonous
fungi
Hospital
wing
Goyle
Snape
said
calmly
Malfoy
got
Hermione
Ron
said
Look
forced
Hermione
show
Snape
her
teeth
she
was
doing
her
best
hide
them
with
her
hands
though
this
was
difficult
they
had
now
grown
down
past
her
collar
Pansy
Parkinson
and
the
other
Slytherin
girls
were
doubled
with
silent
giggles
pointing
Hermione
from
behind
Snape
back
Snape
looked
coldly
Hermione
then
said
see
difference
Hermione
let
out
whimper
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
turned
her
heel
and
ran
ran
all
the
way
the
corridor
and
out
sight
was
lucky
perhaps
that
both
Harry
and
Ron
started
shouting
Snape
the
same
time
lucky
their
voices
echoed
much
the
stone
corridor
for
the
confused
din
was
impossible
for
him
hear
exactly
what
they
were
calling
him
got
the
gist
however
Let
see
said
his
silkiest
voice
Fifty
points
from
Gryffindor
and
detention
each
for
Potter
and
Weasley
Now
get
inside
week
worth
detentions
Harry
ears
were
ringing
The
injustice
made
him
want
curse
Snape
into
thousand
slimy
pieces
passed
Snape
walked
with
Ron
the
back
the
dungeon
and
slammed
his
bag
down
onto
the
table
Ron
was
shaking
with
anger
too
for
moment
felt
though
everything
was
back
normal
between
them
but
then
Ron
turned
and
sat
down
with
Dean
and
Seamus
instead
leaving
Harry
alone
his
table
the
other
side
the
dungeon
Malfoy
turned
his
back
Snape
and
pressed
his
badge
smirking
POTTER
STINKS
flashed
once
more
across
the

Harry
knew

Snape

Harry
imagined

Harry
dully
Exactly

More

Colin
when
they
had
reached
the
right

Harry
knocked
the
door
and
entered

fairly
small
classroom
most
the

been
pushed
away

Five

Ludo

was
sitting

Harry
had
never
seen
before
who
was
wearing
magenta

Viktor
Krum
was
standing
moodily
corner

and
not
talking
anybody
Cedric
and
Fheur

Fheur
looked
good

happier
than
Harry
had
seen
her
far
she
kept
throwing
back
her
head
that
her
long
silvery

Rita
Skeeter
her

Harry
Her
hair
was
set
elaborate
and
curiously
rigid
curls
that
contrasted
oddly
with
her
heavy
jawed
face
She
wore
jeweled

The

Harry
The

Bagman
That

said
Harry
Lovely
said
Rita
Skeeter
and
second
her
scarlet
taloned
fingers
had
Harry
upper
arm
surprisingly
strong
grip
and
she
was
steering
him
out
the
room
again
and
opening
nearby
door

with
all
that

she
said
Let

Harry
stared
her
Come

said
Rita
Skeeter
again
perching
herself
precariously
upon
upturned
bucket
pushing
Harry
down
onto
cardboard
box
and
closing
the
door
throwing
them
into
darkness
Let
see
now
She
unsnapped
her
crocodile
skin
handbag
and
pulled
out
handful
candles
which
she
lit
with
wave
her
wand
and
magicked
into

that

Harry
counted
three
gold
teeth
She
reached
again
into
her
crocodile
bag
and
drew
out
long
acid
green
quill
and
roll
parchment
which
she
stretched
out
between

Mrs

She
put
the

the

into
her

sucked
for

with
apparent
relish
then
placed
upright
the
parchment
where
stood
balanced
its
point
quivering
slightly
Testing

Harry
hooked
down
quickly
the
quill
The
moment
Rita
Skeeter
had
spoken
the
green
quill
had
started
scribble
skidding
across
the
parchment
Attractive

Lovely
said
Rita
Skeeter
yet
again
and
she
ripped
the
top
piece
parchment
off
crumpled
and
stuffed
into
her
handbag
Now
she
leaned
toward
Harry
and
said
Harry
what
made
you
decide
enter
the
Triwizard
Tournament
said
Harry
again
but
was
distracted
the
quill
Even
though
wasn
speaking
was
dashing
across
the
parchment
and
its
wake
could
make
out
fresh
sentence
ugly
scar
souvenier
tragic
past
disfigures
the
otherwise
charming
face
Harry
Potter
whose

Ignore
the

Harry
said
Rita
Skeeter
firmly
Reluctantly
Harry
looked
her
instead
Now
why
did
you
decide
enter
the
tournament
Harry
didn
said
Harry
don
know
how
name
got
into
the
Goblet
Fire
didn
put
there
Rita
Skeeter
raised
one
heavily
penciled
eyebrow
Come
now
Harry
there
need
scared
getting
into
trouble
all
know
you
shouldn
really
have
entered
all
But
don
worry
about
that
Our

But

Harry
repeated
don

How
you

about
the

ahead
said
Rita
Skeeter
Excited
Nervous
haven
really
thought
yeah
nervous
suppose
said
Harry
His
insides
squirmed
uncomfortably
spoke
Champions
have
died
the
past
haven
they
said
Rita
Skeeter
briskly
Have
you
thought
about
that
all
Well
they
say
going
lot
safer
this
year
said
Harry
The
quill
whizzed
across
the
parchment
between
them
back
and
forward
though
were
skating
course
you
looked
death
the
face
before
haven
you
said
Rita
Skeeter
watching
him
closely
How
would
you
say
that
affected
you
said
Harry
yet
again
you
think
that
the
trauma
your
past
might
have
made
you
keen
prove
yourself
live
your
name
you
think
that
perhaps
you
were
tempted
enter
the
Triwizard
Tournament
because
didn
enter
said
Harry
starting
feel
irritated
Can
you
remember
your
parents
all
said
Rita
Skeeter
talking
over
him
said
Harry
How
you
think
they
feel
they
knew
you
were
competing
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Proud
Worried
Angry
Harry
was
feeling
really
annoyed
now
How
earth
was
know
how
his
parents
would
feel
they
were
alive
could
feel
Rita
Skeeter
watching
him
very
intently
Frowning
avoided
her
gaze
and
hooked
down
words
the
quill
had
just
written
Tears

those
startlingly
green
eyes

turns
the

barely

NOT

said
Harry
loudly
Before
Rita
Skeeter
could
say
word
the
door
the
broom
cupboard
was
pulled
open
Harry
looked
around
blinking
the
bright
light
Albus
Dumbledore
stood
there
looking
down
both
them
squashed
into
the
cupboard
Dumbledore
cried
Rita
Skeeter
with
every
appearance
delight
but
Harry
noticed
that
her
quill
and
the
parchment
had
suddenly
vanished
from
the
box
Magical
Mess
Remover
and
Rita
clawed
fingers
were
hastily
snapping
shut
the
clasp
her
crocodile
skin
bag
How
are
you
she
said
standing
and
holding
out
one
her
large
mannish
hands
Dumbledore
hope
you
saw

the
summer
about

International
Confederation

Enchantingly

said
Dumbledore
his
eyes

particularly
enjoyed
your

Rita
Skeeter
didn
look
remotely
abashed
was
just
making
the
point
that
some
your

are
little
old

Dumbhedore
and
that
many

the

will
delighted
hear
the
reasoning
behind

Rita
said
Dumbledore
with
courteous
bow
and
smile
but
afraid
will
have
discuss
the
matter
later

Harry
hurried
back
into
the

The
other

were
now
sitting
chairs
near
the

and
sat
down
quickly
next
Cedric
hooking
the

where
four
the
five

were
now
sitting
Professor
Karkaroff
Madame

Rita

herself
down

Harry
saw

May

Ollivander

Dumbledore
taking
his
place
the

table
and
talking
the
champions
will
checking
your
wands
ensure
that
they
are
good
condition
before
the
tournament
Harry
hooked
around
and
with
jolt
surprise
saw
old
wizard
with
large
pale
eyes
standing
quietly
the
window
Harry
had
met
Ollivander
before
was
the
wand
maker
from
whom
Harry
had
bought
his
own
wand
over
three
years
ago
Diagon
Alley
Mademoiselle
Delacour
could
have
you
first
please
said
Ollivander
stepping
into
the
empty
space
the
middle
the
room
Fleur
Delacour
swept
over
Olhivander
and
handed
him
her
wand
Hmm
said
twirled
the
wand
between
his
long
fingers
like
baton
and
emitted
number
pink
and
gold
sparks
Then
held
chose
his
eyes
and
examined
carefully
Yes

quietly

half
inches

Fleur
One

Fleur

Harry
making
mental
note
tell
Ron
then
remembered
that
Ron
wasn
speaking
him
Yes
said
Ollivander
yes
never
used
veela
hair
myself
course
find
makes
for
rather
temperamental
wands
however
each
his
own
and
this
suits
you
Ollivander
ran
his
fingers
along
the
wand
apparently
checking
for
scratches
bumps
then
muttered
Orchideous
and
bunch
flowers
burst
from
the
wand
tip
Very
well
very
well
fine
working
order
said
Ollivander
scooping
the
flowers
and
handing
them
Fleur
with
her
wand
Diggory
you
next
Fleur
glided
back
her
seat
smiling
Cedric
passed
her
now
this
one
mine
isn
said
Ollivander
with
much
more
enthusiasm
Cedric
handed
over
his
wand
Yes

well
Containing

Polished

Cedric
grinning
Harry
hooked
down
his
own
wand
could
see
finger
marks
all
over
gathered
fistful
robe
from
his
knee
and
tried
rub
clean
surreptitiously
Several
gold
sparks
shot
out
the
end
Fleur
Delacour
gave
him
very
patronizing
look
and
desisted
Ollivander
sent
stream
silver
smoke
rings
across
the
room
from
the
tip
Cedric

pronounced
himself
satisfied
and
then
said
Krum
you
please
Viktor
Krum
got
and
slouched
round
shouldered
and
duck
footed
toward
Ollivander
thrust
out
his
wand
and
stood
scowling
with
his
hands
the
pockets
his
robes
Hmm
said
Olhivander
this
Gregorovitch
creation
unless
much
mistaken
fine
wand
maker
though
the
styling
never
quite
what
however
lifted
the
wand
and
examined
minutely
turning
over
and
over
before
his
eyes
Yes

Krum
who
nodded
Rather

The

flew
out

and
through

into

sunlight
Good
said
Ollivander
handing
Krum
back
his
wand
Which
leaves
Potter
Harry
got
his
feet
and
walked
past
Krum
Ollivander
handed
over
his
wand
Aaaah
yes
said
Ohlivander
his
pale
eyes
suddenly
gleaming
Yes
yes
yes
How
well
remember
Harry
could
remember
too
could
remember
though
had
happened
yesterday
Four
summers
ago
his
eleventh
birthday
had
entered
Ollivander
shop
with
Hagrid
buy
wand
Ollivander
had
taken
his
measurements
and
then
started
handing
him
wands
try
Harry
had
waved
what
felt
like
every
wand
the
shop
until
last
had
found
the
one
that
suited
him
this
one
which
was
made
holly
eleven
inches
long
and
contained
single
feather
from
the
tail
phoenix
Ollivander
had
been
very
surprised
that
Harry
had
been
compatible
with
this
wand
Curious
had
said
curious
and
not
until
Harry
asked
what
was
curious
had
Olhivander
explained
that
the
phoenix
feather
Harry
wand
had
come
from
the
same
bird
that
had
supplied
the
core
Lord
Voldemort
Harry
had
never
shared
this
piece
information
with
anybody
was
very
fond
his
wand
and
far
was
concerned
its
relation
Voldemort
wand
was
something
couldn
help
rather
couldn
help
being
related
Aunt
Petunia
However
really
hoped
that
Ollivander
wasn
about
tell
the
room
about
had
funny
feeling
Rita
Skeeter
Quick
Quotes
Quill
might
just
explode
with
excitement
did
Ollivander
spent
much
longer
examining
Harry
wand
than
anyone
else
Eventually
however
made
fountain
wine
shoot
out
and
handed
back
Harry
announcing
that
was
still
perfect
condition
Thank
you
all
said
Dumbledore
standing
the
judges
table
You
may
back
your
lessons
now
perhaps
would
quicker
just
down
dinner
they
are
about
end
Feeling
that
last
something
had
gone
right
today
Harry
got
leave
but
the
man
with
the
black
camera
jumped
and
cleared
his
throat
Photos
Dumbledore
photos
cried
Bagman
excitedly
All
the
judges
and
champions
what
you
think
Rita
yes
let
those
first
said
Rita
Skeeter
whose
eyes
were
upon
Harry
again
And
then
perhaps
some
individual
shots
The
photographs
took
long
time
Madame
Maxime
cast
everyone
else
into
shadow
wherever
she
stood
and
the
photographer
couldn
stand
far
enough
back
get
her
into
the
frame
eventually
she
had
sit
while
everyone
else
stood
around
her
Karkaroff
kept
twirling
his
goatee
around
his
finger
give
extra
curl
Krum
whom
Harry
would
have
thought
would
have
been
used
this
sort
thing
skulked
half
hidden
the
back
the
group
The
photographer
seemed
keenest
get
Fleur
the
front
but
Rita
Skeeter
kept
hurrying
forward
and
dragging
Harry
into
greater
prominence
Then
she
insisted
separate
shots
all
the
champions
last
they
were
free
Harry
went
down
dinner
Hermione
wasn
there
supposed
she
was
still
the
hospital
wing
having
her
teeth
fixed
ate
alone
the
end
the

then
returned
Gryffindor

thinking
all
the
extra

Summoning

that
had

came
across
Ron
You

said
Ron
brusquely
the
moment
walked
was
pointing
Harry

The

was
waiting
for
him
there
right
said
Harry
And
got

Snape

said
Ron
then
walked
straight
out
the
room
not
looking
Harry
For
moment
Harry
considered
going
after
him
wasn
sure
whether
wanted
talk
him
hit
him
both
seemed
quite
appealing
but
the
lure
Sirius
answer
was
too
strong
Harry
strode
over
the
barn
owl
took
the
letter
off
its
leg
and
unrolled
Harry
can
say
everything
would
like
letter
too
risky
case
the
owl
intercepted
need
talk
face
face
Can
you
ensure
that
you

Gryffindor

one

the

the
22nd

know
better
than
anyone
that
you
can
look
after
yourself
and
while
you
around
Dumbledore
and
Moody
don
think
anyone
will
able
hurt
you
However
someone
seems
having
good
try
Entering
you
that
tournament
would
have
been
very
risky
especially
right
under
Dumbkdore
nose
the
watch
Harry
still
want
hear
about
anything
unusual
Let
know
about
the
22nd

The
prospect

Sirius
was
all
that
sustained
Harry
over
the
next
fortnight
the
only
bright
spot
horizon
that
had
never
looked
darker
The
shock
finding
himself
school
champion
had
worn
off
slightly
now
and
the
fear
what
was
facing
him
had
started
sink
The
first
task
was
drawing
steadily
nearer
felt
though
were
crouching
ahead
him
hike
some
horrific
monster
barring
his
path
had
never
suffered
nerves
like
these
they
were
way
beyond
anything
had
experienced
before
Quidditch
match
not
even
his
last
one
against
Slytherin
which
had
decided
who
would
win
the
Quidditch
Cup
Harry
was
finding
hard
think
about
the
future
all
felt
though
his
whole
life
had
been
heading
and
would
finish
with
the
first
task
Admittedly
didn
see
how
Sirius
was
going
make
him
feel
any
better
about
having
perform
unknown
piece
difficult
and
dangerous
magic
front
hundreds
people
but
the
mere
sight
friendly
face
would
something
the
moment
Harry
wrote
back
Sirius
saying
that
would
beside
the
common
room
fire
the
time
Sirius
had
suggested
and
and
Hermione
spent
long
time
going
over
plans
for
forcing
any
stragglers
out
the
common
room
the
night
question
the
worst
came
the
worst
they
were
going
drop
bag
Dungbombs
but
they
hoped
they
wouldn
have
resort
that
Filch
would
skin
them
alive
the
meantime
life
became
even
worse
for
Harry
within
the
confines
the
castle
for
Rita
Skeeter
had
published
her
piece
about
the
Triwizard
Tournament
and
had
turned
out
not
much
report
the
tournament
highly
colored
life
story
Harry
Much
the
front
page
had
been
given
over
picture
Harry
the
article
continuing
pages
two
six
and
seven
had
been
all
about
Harry
the
names
the
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
champions
misspelled
had
been
squashed
into
the
last
line
the
article
and
Cedric
hadn
been
mentioned
all
The
article
had
appeared
ten
days
ago
and
Harry
still
got
sick
burning
feeling
shame
his
stomach
every
time
thought
about
Rita
Skeeter
had
reported
him
saying
awful
lot
things
that
couldn
remember
ever
saying
his
life
let
alone
that
broom
cupboard
suppose
get
strength
from
parents
know
they
very
proud
they
could
see
now
Yes
sometimes
night
still
cry
about
them
not
ashamed
admit
know
nothing
will
hurt
during
the
tournament
because
they
watching
over
But
Rita
Skeeter
had
gone
even
further
than
transforming
his
into
long
sickly
sentences
She
had
interviewed
other
people
about
him
too
Harry
has
last
found
love
Hogwarts
His
close
friend
Colin
Creevey
says
that
Harry
rarely
seen
out
the
company
one
Hermione
Granger
stunningly
pretty
Muggle
born
girl
who
like
Harry
one
the
top
students
the
school
From
the
moment
the
article
had
appeared
Harry
had
had
endure
people
Slytherins
mainly
quoting
him
passed
and
making
sneering
comments
Want
hanky
Potter
case
you
start
crying
Transfiguration
Since
when
have
you
been
one
the
top
students
the
school
Potter
this
school
you
and
Longbottom
have
set
together
Hey
Harry
Yeah
that
right
Harry
found
himself
shouting
wheeled
around
the
corridor
having
had
just
about
enough
just
been
crying
eyes
out
over
dead
mum
and
just
off
bit
more
was
just
you
dropped
your
quill
was
Cho
Harry
felt
the
color
rising
his
face
right
sorry
muttered
taking
the
quill
back
good
luck
Tuesday
she
said
really
hope
you
well
Which
left
Harry
feeling
extremely
stupid
Hermione
had
come
for
her
fair
share
unpleasantness
too
but
she
hadn
yet
started
yelling
innocent
bystanders
fact
Harry
was
full
admiration
for
the
way
she
was
handling
the
situation
Stunningly
pretty
Her
Pansy
Parkinson
had
shrieked
the
first
time
she
had
come
face
face
with
Hermione
after
Rita
article
had
appeared
What
was
she
judging
against
chipmunk
Ignore
Hermione
said
dignified
voice
holding
her
head
the
air
and
stalking
past
the
sniggering
Slytherin
girls
though
she
couldn
hear
them
Just
ignore
Harry
But
Harry
couldn
ignore
Ron
hadn
spoken
him
all
since
had
told
him
about
Snape
detentions
Harry
had
half
hoped
they
would
make
things
during
the
two
hours
they
were
forced
pickle
rats
brains
Snape
dungeon
but
that
had
been
the
day
Rita
article
had
appeared
which
seemed
have
confirmed
Ron
belief
that
Harry
was
really
enjoying
all
the
attention
Hermione
was
furious
with
the
pair
them
she
went
from
one
the
other
trying
force
them
talk
each
other
but
Harry
was
adamant
would
talk
Ron
again
only
Ron
admitted
that
Harry
hadn
put
his
name
the
Goblet
Fire
and
apologized
for
calling
him
liar
didn
start
this
Harry
said
stubbornly
his
problem
You
miss
him
Hermione
said
impatiently
And
know
misses
you
Miss
him
said
Harry
don
miss
him
But
this
was
downright
lie
Harry
liked
Hermione
very
much
but
she
just
wasn
the
same
Ron
There
was
much
hess
laughter
and
lot
more
hanging
around
the
library
when
Hermione
was
your
best
friend
Harry
still
hadn
mastered
Summoning
Charms
seemed
have
developed
something
block
about
them
and
Hermione
insisted
that
learning
the
theory
would
help
They
consequently
spent
lot
time
poring
over
books
during
their
lunchtimes
Viktor
Krum
was
the
library
awful
lot
too
and
Harry
wondered
what
was
Was
studying
was
looking
for
things
help
him
through
the
first
task
Hermione
often
complained
about
Krum
being
there
not
that
ever
bothered
them
but
because
groups
giggling
girls
often
turned
spy
him
from
behind
bookshelves
and
Hermione
found
the
noise
distracting
not
even
good
looking
she
muttered
angrily
glaring
Krum
sharp
profile
They
only
like
him
because
famous
They
wouldn
look
twice
him
couldn
that
WonkyFaint
thing
Wronski
Feint
said
Harry
through
gritted
teeth
Quite
apart
from
liking
get
Quidditch
terms
correct
caused
him
another
pang
imagine
Ron
expression
could
have
heard
Hermione
talking
about
Wonky
Faints
strange
thing
but
when
you
are
dreading
something
and
would
give
anything
slow
down
time
has
disobliging
habit
speeding
The
days
until
the
first
task
seemed
slip
though
someone
had
fixed
the
clocks
work
double
speed
Harry
feeling
barely
controlled
panic
was
with
him
wherever
went
everpresent
the
snide
comments
about
the
Daily
Prophet
article
the
Saturday
before
the
first
task
all
students
the
third
year
and
above
were
permitted
visit
the
village
Hogsmeade
Hermione
told
Harry
that
would
him
good
get
away
from
the
castle
for
bit
and
Harry
didn
need
much
persuasion
What
about
Ron
though
said
Don
you
want
with
him
well
Hermione
went
slightly
pink
thought
might
meet
with
him
the
Three
Broomsticks
said
Harry
flatly
Harry
this
stupid
come
but
not
meeting
Ron
and
wearing
Invisibility
Cloak
all
right
then
Hermione
snapped
but
hate
talking
you
that
cloak
never
know
looking
you
not
Harry
put
his
Invisibility
Cloak
the
dormitory
went
back
downstairs
and
together
and
Hermione
set
off
for
Hogsmeade
Harry
felt
wonderfully
free
under
the
cloak
watched
other
students
walking
past
them
they
entered
the
village
most
them
sporting
Support
Cedric
Diggory
badges
but
horrible
remarks
came
his
way
for
change
and
nobody
was
quoting
that
stupid
article
People
keep
looking
now
said
Hermione
grumpily
they
came
out
Honeydukes
Sweetshop
later
eating
large
cream
filled
chocolates
They
think
talking
myself
Don
move
your
lips
much
then
Come
please
just
take
off
your
cloak
for
bit
one
going
bother
you
here
yeah
said
Harry
Look
behind
you
Rita
Skeeter
and
her
photographer
friend
had
just
emerged
from
the
Three
Broomsticks
pub
Talking
low
voices
they
passed
right
Hermione
without
hooking
her
Harry
backed
into
the
wall
Honeydukes
stop
Rita
Skeeter
from
hitting
him
with
her
crocodile
skin
handbag
When
they
were
gone
Harry
said
She
staying
the
village
bet
she
coming
watch
the
first
task
said
his
stomach
flooded
with
wave
molten
panic
didn
mention
this
and
Hermione
hadn
discussed
what
was
coming
the
first
task
much
had
the
feeling
she
didn
want
think
about
She
gone
said
Hermione
looking
right
through
Harry
toward
the
end
the
street
Why
don
and
have
butterbeer
the
Three
Broomsticks
bit
cold
isn
You
don
have
talk
Ron
she
added
irritably
correctly
interpreting
his
silence
The
Three
Broomsticks
was
packed
mainly
with
Hogwarts
students
enjoying
their
free
afternoon
but
also
with
variety
magical
people
Harry
rarely
saw
anywhere
else
Harry
supposed
that
Hogsmeade
was
the
only
all
wizard
village
Britain
was
bit
haven
for
creatures
like
hags
who
were
not
adept
wizards
disguising
themselves
was
very
hard
move
through
crowds
the
Invisibility
Cloak
case
you
accidentally
trod
someone
which
tended
lead
awkward
questions
Harry
edged
slowly
toward
spare
table
the
corner
while
Hermione
went
buy
drinks
his
way
through
the
pub
Harry
spotted
Ron
who
was
sitting
with
Fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
Resisting
the
urge
give
Ron
good
hard
poke
the
back
the
head
finally
reached
the
table
and
sat
down
Hermione
joined
him
moment
later
and
slipped
him
butterbeer
under
his
cloak
look
like
such
idiot
sitting
here
own
she
muttered
Lucky
brought
something
And
she
pulled
out
notebook
which
she
had
been
keeping
record
members
Harry
saw
his
and
Ron
names
the
top
the
very
short
list
seemed
long
time
ago
that
they
had
sat
making
those
predictions
together
and
Hermione
had
turned
and
appointed
them
secretary
and
treasurer
You
know
maybe
should
try
and
get
some
the
villagers
involved
Hermione
said
thoughtfully
looking
around
the
pub
Yeah
right
said
Harry
took
swig
butterbeer
under
his
cloak
Hermione
when
are
you
going
give
this
spew
stuff
When
house
elves
have
decent
wages
and
working
conditions
she
hissed
back
You
know
starting
think
time
for
more
direct
action
wonder
how
you
get
into
the
school
kitchens
idea
ask
Fred
and
George
said
Harry
Hermione
lapsed
into
thoughtful
silence
while
Harry
drank
his
butterbeer
watching
the
people
the
pub
All
them
looked
cheerful
and
relaxed
Ernie
Macmillan
and
Hannah
Abbot
were
swapping
Chocolate
Frog
cards
nearby
table
both
them
sporting
Support
Cedric
Diggory
badges
their
cloaks
Right
over
the
door
saw
Cho
and
large
group
her
Ravenclaw
friends
She
wasn
wearing
Cedric
badge
though
This
cheered
Harry
very
slightly
What
wouldn
have
given
one
these
peophe
sitting
around
laughing
and
talking
with
nothing
worry
about
but
homework
imagined
how
would
have
felt
here
his
name
hadn
come
out
the
Goblet
Fire
wouldn
wearing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
for
one
thing
Ron
would
sitting
with
him
The
three
them
would
probably
happily
imagining
what
deadly
dangerous
task
the
school
champions
would
facing
Tuesday
have
been
really
hooking
forward
watching
them
whatever
was
cheering
Cedric
with
everyone
else
safe
seat
the
back
the
stands
wondered
how
the
other
champions
were
feeling
Every
time
had
seen
Cedric
lately
had
been
surrounded
admirers
and
looking
nervous
but
excited
Harry
glimpsed
Fleur
Delacour
from
time
time
the
corridors
she
looked
exactly
she
always
did
haughty
and
unruffled
And
Krum
just
sat
the
library
poring
over
books
Harry
thought
Sirius
and
the
tight
tense
knot
his
chest
seemed
ease
slightly
would
speaking
him
just
over
twelve
hours
for
tonight
was
the
night
they
were
meeting
the
common
room
fire
assuming
nothing
went
wrong
everything
else
had
done
lately
Look
Hagrid
said
Hermione
The
back
Hagrid
enormous
shaggy
head
had
mercifully
abandoned
his
bunches
emerged
over
the
crowd
Harry
wondered
why
hadn
spotted
him
once
Hagrid
was
large
but
standing
carefully
saw
that
Hagrid
had
been
leaning
low
talking
Professor
Moody
Hagrid
had
his
usual
enormous
tankard
front
him
but
Moody
was
drinking
from
his
hip
flask
Madam
Rosmerta
the
pretty
landlady
didn
seem
think
much
this
she
was
looking
askance
Moody
she
collected
glasses
from
tables
around
them
Perhaps
she
thought
was
insult
her
mulled
mead
but
Harry
knew
better
Moody
had
told
them
all
during
their
last
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
that
preferred
prepare
his
own
food
and
drink
all
times
was
easy
for
Dark
wizards
poison
unattended
cup
Harry
watched
saw
Hagrid
and
Moody
get
leave
waved
then
remembered
that
Hagrid
couldn
see
him
Moody
however
paused
his
magical
eye
the
corner
where
Harry
was
standing
tapped
Hagrid
the
small
the
back
being
unable
reach
his
shoulder
muttered
something
him
and
then
the
pair
them
made
their
way
back
across
the
pub
toward
Harry
and
Hermione
table
All
right
Hermione
said
Hagrid
loudly
Hello
said
Hermione
smiling
back
Moody
limped
around
the
table
and
bent
down
Harry
thought
was
reading
the
notebook
until
muttered
Nice
cloak
Potter
Harry
stared
him
amazement
The
large
chunk
missing
from
Moody
nose
was
particularly
obvious
few
inches
distance
Moody
grinned
Can
your
eye
mean
can
you
Yeah
can
see
through
Invisibility
Cloaks
Moody
said
quietly
And
come
useful
times
can
tell
you
Hagrid
was
beaming
down
Harry
too
Harry
knew
Hagrid
couldn
see
him
but
Moody
had
obviously
told
Hagrid
was
there
Hagrid
now
bent
down
the
pretext
reading
the
notebook
well
and
said
whisper
low
that
only
Harry
could
hear
Harry
meet
tonight
midnight
cabin
Wear
that
cloak
Straightening
Hagrid
said
loudly
Nice
ter
see
yeh
Hermione
winked
and
departed
Moody
followed
him
Why
does
Hagrid
want
meet
him
midnight
Harry
said
very
surprised
Does
said
Hermione
looking
startled
wonder
what
don
know
whether
you
should
Harry
She
looked
nervously
around
and
hissed
might
make
you
late
for
Sirius
was
true
that
going
down
Hagrid
midnight
would
mean
cutting
his
meeting
with
Sirius
very
fine
indeed
Hermione
suggested
sending
Hedwig
down
Hagrid
tell
him
couldn
always
assuming
she
would
consent
take
the
note
course
Harry
however
thought
better
just
quick
whatever
Hagrid
wanted
him
for
was
very
curious
know
what
this
might
Hagrid
had
never
asked
Harry
visit
him
late
night
half
past
eleven
that
evening
Harry
who
had
pretended
bed
early
pulled
the
Invisibility
Cloak
back
over
himself
and
crept
back
downstairs
through
the
common
room
Quite
few
people
were
still
there
The
Creevey
brothers
had
managed
get
hold
stack
Support
Cedric
Diggory
badges
and
were
trying
bewitch
them
make
them
say
Support
Harry
Potter
instead
far
however
all
they
had
managed
was
get
the
badges
stuck
POTTER
STINKS
Harry
crept
past
them
the
portrait
hole
and
waited
for
minute
keeping
eye
his
watch
Then
Hermione
opened
the
Fat
Lady
for
him
from
outside
they
had
planned
slipped
past
her
with
whispered
Thanks
and
set
off
through
the
castle
The
grounds
were
very
dark
Harry
walked
down
the
lawn
toward
the
lights
shining
Hagrid
cabin
The
inside
the
enormous
Beauxbatons
carriage
was
also
lit
Harry
could
hear
Madame
Maxime
talking
inside
knocked
Hagrid
front
door
You
there
Harry
Hagrid
whispered
opening
the
door
and
looking
around
Yeah
said
Harry
slipping
inside
the
cabin
and
pulling
the
cloak
down
off
his
head
What
Got
summat
ter
show
yeh
said
Hagrid
There
was
air
enormous
excitement
about
Hagrid
was
wearing
flower
that
resembled
oversized
artichoke
his
buttonhole
looked
though
had
abandoned
the
use
axle
grease
but
had
certainly
attempted
comb
his
hair
Harry
could
see
the
comb
broken
teeth
tangled
What
you
showing
Harry
said
warily
wondering
the
skrewts
had
laid
eggs
Hagrid
had
managed
buy
another
giant
three
headed
dog
off
stranger
pub
Come
with
keep
quiet
keep
yerself
covered
with
that
cloak
said
Hagrid
won
take
Fang
won
like
Listen
Hagrid
can
stay
long
got
back
the
castle
one
clock
But
Hagrid
wasn
listening
was
opening
the
cabin
door
and
striding
off
into
the
night
Harry
hurried
follow
and
found
his
great
surprise
that
Hagrid
was
leading
him
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
Hagrid
what
Shhh
said
Hagrid
and
knocked
three
times
the
door
bearing
the
crossed
golden
wands
Madame
Maxime
opened
She
was
wearing
silk
shawl
wrapped
around
her
massive
shoulders
She
smiled
when
she
saw
Hagrid
Agrid
time
Bong
sewer
said
Hagrid
beaming
her
and
holding
out
hand
help
her
down
the
golden
steps
Madame
Maxime
closed
the
door
behind
her
Hagrid
offered
her
his
arm
and
they
set
off
around
the
edge
the
paddock
containing
Madame
Maxime
giant
winged
horses
with
Harry
totally
bewildered
running
keep
with
them
Had
Hagrid
wanted
show
him
Madame
Maxime
could
see
her
any
old
time
wanted
she
wasn
exactly
hard
miss
But
seemed
that
Madame
Maxime
was
for
the
same
treat
Harry
because
after
while
she
said
playfully
Wair
you
are
taking
Agrid
Yeh
enjoy
this
said
Hagrid
gruffly
worth
seein
trust

said
Madame
Maxime
fluttering
her
long
black
eyelashes
And
still
they
walked
Harry
getting
more
and
more
irritated
jogged
along
their
wake
checking
his
watch
every
now
and
then
Hagrid
had
some
harebrained
scheme
hand
which
might
make
him
miss
Sirius
they
didn
get
there
soon
was
going
turn
around
straight
back
the
castle
and
leave
Hagrid
enjoy
his
moonlit
stroll
with
Madame
Maxime
But
then
when
they
had
walked
far
around
the
perimeter
the
forest
that
the
castle
and
the
lake
were
out
sight
Harry
heard
something
Men
were
shouting
ahead
then
came
deafening
earsplitting
roar
Hagrid
led
Madame
Maxime
around
clump
trees
and
came
halt
Harry
hurried
alongside
them
for
split
second
thought
was
seeing
bonfires
and
men
darting
around
them
and
then
his
mouth
fell
open
Dragons
Four
fully
grown
enormous
vicious
looking
dragons
were
rearing
onto
their
hind
legs
inside
enclosure
fenced
with
thick
planks
wood
roaring
and
snorting
torrents
fire
were
shooting
into
the
dark
sky
from
their
open
fanged
mouths
fifty
feet
above
the
ground
their
outstretched
necks
There
was
silvery
blue
one
with
long
pointed
horns
snapping
and
snarling
the
wizards
the
ground
smooth
scaled
green
one
which
was
writhing
and
stamping
with
all
its
might
red
one
with
odd
fringe
fine
gold
spikes
around
its
face
which
was
shooting
mushroom
shaped
fire
clouds
into
the
air
and
gigantic
black
one
more
lizard
hike
than
the
others
which
was
nearest
them
least
thirty
wizards
seven
eight
each
dragon
were
attempting
control
them
pulling
the
chains
connected
heavy
leather
straps
around
their
necks
and
legs
Mesmerized
Harry
looked
high
above
him
and
saw
the
eyes
the
black
dragon
with
vertical
pupils
like
cat
bulging
with
either
fear
rage
couldn
tell
which
was
making
horrible
noise
yowling
screeching
scream
Keep
back
there
Hagrid
yelled
wizard
near
the
fence
straining
the
chain
was
holding
They
can
shoot
fire
range
twenty
feet
you
know
seen
this
Horntail
forty
beautiful
said
Hagrid
softly
good
yelled
another
wizard
Stunning
Spells
the
count
three
Harry
saw
each
the
dragon
keepers
pull
out
his
wand
Stupefy
they
shouted
unison
and
the
Stunning
Spells
shot
into
the
darkness
like
fiery
rockets
bursting
showers
stars
the
dragons
scaly
hides
Harry
watched
the
dragon
nearest
them
teeter
dangerously
its
back
legs
its
jaws
stretched
wide
silent
howl
its
nostrils
were
suddenly
devoid
flame
though
still
smoking
then
very
slowly
fell
Several
tons
sinewy
scaly
black
dragon
hit
the
ground
with
thud
that
Harry
could
have
sworn
made
the
trees
behind
him
quake
The
dragon
keepers
lowered
their
wands
and
walked
forward
their
fallen
charges
each
which
was
the
size
small
hill
They
hurried
tighten
the
chains
and
fasten
them
securely
iron
pegs
which
they
forced
deep
into
the
ground
with
their
wands
Wan
closer
look
Hagrid
asked
Madame
Maxime
excitedly
The
pair
them
moved
right
the
fence
and
Harry
followed
The
wizard
who
had
warned
Hagrid
not
come
any
closer
turned
and
Harry
realized
who
was
Charlie
Weasley
All
right
Hagrid
panted
coming
over
talk
They
should
okay
now
put
them
out
with
Sleeping
Draft
the
way
here
thought
might
better
for
them
wake
the
dark
and
the
quiet
but
like
you
saw
they
weren
happy
not
happy
all
What
breeds
you
got
here
Charlie
said
Hagrid
gazing
the
closest
dragon
the
black
one
with
something
chose
reverence
Its
eyes
were
still
just
open
Harry
could
see
strip
gleaming
yellow
beneath
its
wrinkled
black
eyelid
This

Charlie

around

edge
the
enclosure
gazing
the
stunned
dragons

Hagrid
Charlie
said
frowning
The

Jus

Hagrid
still

enraptured
the
dragons
Really

Charlie
shaking
his

Four

Hagrid

Its

its

Charlie
pointed
toward
the
Horntail
tail
and
Harry
saw
long
bronze
colored
spikes
protruding
along
every
few
inches
Five
Charlie
fellow
keepers
staggered
the
Horntail
that
moment
carrying
clutch
huge
granite
gray
eggs
between

They
placed
them
carefully
the
Horntail
side
Hagrid
let
out

Hagrid
said
Charlie
sternly
Then
said
How
Harry
Fine
said
Hagrid
was
still
gazing
the
eggs
Just
hope
still
fine
after
faced
this
lot
said
Charlie
grimly
looking
out
over
the
dragons
enclosure
didn
dare
tell
Mum
what
got
for
the
first
task
she
already
having
kittens
about
him
Charlie
imitated
his
mother
anxious
voice
How
could
they
let
him
enter
that
tournament
much
too
young
thought
they
were
all
safe
thought
there
was
going
age
limit
She
was
floods
after
that
Daily
Prophet
article
about
him
still
cries
about
his
parents
bless
him
never
knew
Harry
had
had
enough
Trusting
the
fact
that
Hagrid
wouldn
miss
him
with
the
attractions
four
dragons
and
Madame
Maxime
occupy
him
turned
silently
and
began
walk
away
back
the
castle
didn
know
whether
was
glad
seen
what
was
coming
not
Perhaps
this
way
was
better
The
first
shock
was
over
now
Maybe
seen
the
dragons
for
the
first
time
Tuesday
would
have
passed
out
cold
front
the
whole
school
but
maybe
would
anyway
was
going
armed
with
his
wand
which
just
now
felt
like
nothing
more
than
narrow
strip
wood
against
fifty
foot
high
scaly
spike
ridden
fire
breathing
dragon
And
had
get
past
With
everyone
watching
How
Harry
sped
skirting
the
edge
the
forest
had
just
under
fifteen
minutes
get
back
the
fireside
and
talk
Sirius
and
couldn
remember
ever
wanting
talk
someone
more
than
did
right
now
when
without
warning
ran
into
something
very
solid
Harry
fell
backward
his
glasses
askew
clutching
the
cloak
around
him
voice
nearby
said
Ouch
Who
there
Harry
hastily
checked
that
the
cloak
was
covering
him
and
hay
very
still
staring
the
dark
outline
the
wizard
had
hit
recognized
the
goatee
was
Karkaroff
Who
there
said
Karkaroff
again
very
suspiciously
looking
around
the
darkness
Harry
remained
still
and
silent
After
minute
Karkaroff
seemed
decide
that
had
hit
some
sort
animal
was
looking
around
waist
height
though
expecting
see
dog
Then
crept
back
under
the
cover
the
trees
and
started
edge
forward
toward
the
place
where
the
dragons
were
Very
slowly
and
very
carefully
Harry
got
his
feet
and
set
off
again
fast
could
without
making
too
much
noise
hurrying
through
the
darkness
back
toward
Hogwarts
had
doubt
whatsoever
what
Karkaroff
was
had
sneaked
off
his
ship
try
and
find
out
what
the
first
task
was
going
might
even
have
spotted
Hagrid
and
Madame
Maxime
heading
off
around
the
forest
together
they
were
hardly
difficult
spot
distance
and
now
all
Karkaroff
had
was
follow
the
sound
voices
and
like
Madame
Maxime
would
know
what
was
store
for
the
champions
the
looks
the
only
champion
who
would
facing
the
unknown
Tuesday
was
Cedric
Harry
reached
the
castle
slipped
through
the
front
doors
and
began
climb
the
marble
stairs
was
very
out
breath
but
didn
dare
slow
down
had
less
than
five
minutes
get
the
fire
Balderdash
gasped
the
Fat
Lady
who
was
snoozing
her
frame
front
the
portrait
hole
you
say
she
muttered
sleepily
without
opening
her
eyes
and
the
picture
swung
forward
admit
him
Harry
climbed
inside
The
common
room
was
deserted
and
judging
the
fact
that
smelled
quite
normal
Hermione
had
not
needed
set
off
any
Dungbombs
ensure
that
and
Sirius
got
privacy
Harry
pulled
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
threw
himself
into
armchair
front
the
fire
The
room
was
semidarkness
the
flames
were
the
only
source
light
Nearby
table
the
Support
Cedric
Diggory
badges
the
Creeveys
had
been
trying
improve
were
glinting
the
firelight
They
now
read
POTTER
REALLY
STINKS
Harry
looked
back
into
the
flames
and
jumped
Sirius
head
was
sitting
the
fire
Harry
hadn
seen
Diggory
exactly
this
back
the
Weasleys
kitchen
would
have
scared
him
out
his
wits
Instead
his
face
breaking
into
the
first
smile
had
worn
for
days
scrambled
out
his
chair
crouched
down
the
hearth
and
said
Sirius
how
you
doing
Sirius
looked
different
from
Harry
memory
him
When
they
had
said
good
bye
Sirius
face
had
been
gaunt
and
sunken
surrounded
quantity
long
black
matted
hair
but
the
hair
was
short
and
clean
now
Sirius
face
was
fuller
and
looked
younger
much
more
like
the
only
photograph
Harry
had
him
which
had
been
taken
the
Potters
wedding
Never
mind
how
are
you
said
Sirius
seriously
For
second
Harry
tried
say
fine
but
couldn
Before
could
stop
himself
was
talking
more
than
talked
days
about
how
one
believed
hadn
entered
the
tournament
his
own
free
will
how
Rita
Skeeter
had
lied
about
him
the
Daily
Prophet
how
couldn
walk
down
corridor
without
being
sneered
and
about
Ron
Ron
not
believing
him
Ron
jealousy
and
now
Hagrid
just
shown
what
coming
the
first
task
and
dragons
Sirius
and
goner
finished
desperately
Sirius
looked
him
eyes
full
concern
eyes
that
had
not
yet
lost
the
look
that
Azkaban
had
given
them
that
deadened
haunted
look
had
let
Harry
talk
himself
into
silence
without
interruption
but
now
said
Dragons
can
deal
with
Harry
but
get
that
minute
haven
got
long
here
broken
into
wizarding
house
use
the
fire
but
they
could
back
any
time
There
are
things
need
warn
you
about
What
said
Harry
feeling
his
spirits
slip
further
few
notches
Surely
there
could
nothing
worse
than
dragons
coming
Karkaroff
said
Sirius
Harry
was
Death
Eater
You
know
what
Death
Eaters
are
don
you
Yes
what
was
caught
was
Azkaban
with
but
got
released
bet
everything
that
why
Dumbledore
wanted
Auror
Hogwarts
this
year
keep
eye
him
Moody
caught
Karkaroff
Put
him
into
Azkaban
the
first
place
Karkaroff
got
released
Harry
said
slowly
his
brain
seemed
struggling
absorb
yet
another
piece
shocking
information
Why
did
they
release
him
did
deal
with
the
Ministry
Magic
said
Sirius
bitterly
said
seen
the
error
his
ways
and
then
named
names
put
load
other
people
into
Azkaban
his
place
not
very
popular
there
can
tell
you
And
since
got
out
from
what
can
tell
been
teaching
the
Dark
Arts
every
student
who
passes
through
that
school
his
watch
out
for
the
Durmstrang
champion
well
Okay
said
Harry
slowly
But
are
you
saying
Karkaroff
put
name
the
goblet
Because
did
really
good
actor
seemed
furious
about
wanted
stop
from
competing
know
good
actor
said
Sirius
because
convinced
the
Ministry
Magic
set
him
free
didn
Now
been
keeping
eye
the
Daily
Prophet
Harry
you
and
the
rest
the
world
said
Harry
bitterly
and
reading
between
the
lines
that
Skeeter
woman
article
last
month
Moody
was
attacked
the
night
before
started
Hogwarts
Yes
know
she
says
was
another
false
alarm
Sirius
said
hastily
seeing
Harry
about
speak
but
don
think
somehow
think
someone
tried
stop
him
from
getting
Hogwarts
think
someone
knew
their
job
would
lot
more
difficult
with
him
around
And
one
going
look
into
too
closely
Mad
Eye
heard
intruders
bit
too
often
But
that
doesn
mean
can
still
spot
the
real
thing
Moody
was
the
best
Auror
the
Ministry
ever
had
what
are
you
saying
said
Harry
slowly
Karkaroff
trying
kill
But
why
Sirius
hesitated
been
nearing
some
very
strange
things
said
slowly
The
Death
Eaters
seem
bit
more
active
than
usual
lately
They
showed
themselves
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
didn
they
Someone
set
off
the
Dark
Mark
and
then
did
you
hear
about
that
Ministry
Magic
witch
who
gone
missing
Bertha
Jorkins
said
Harry
Exactly
she
disappeared
Albania
and
that
definitely
where
Voldemort
was
rumored
last
and
she
would
have
known
the
Triwizard
Tournament
was
coming
wouldn
she
Yeah
but
not
very
likely
she
have
walked
straight
into
Voldemort
said
Harry
Listen
knew
Bertha
Jorkins
said
Sirius
grimly
She
was
Hogwarts
when
was
few
years
above
your
dad
and
And
she
was
idiot
Very
nosy
but
brains
none
all
not
good
combination
Harry
say
she
very
easy
lure
into
trap
Voldemort
could
have
found
out
about
the
tournament
said
Harry
that
what
you
mean
You
think
Karkaroff
might
here
his
orders
don
know
said
Sirius
slowly
just
don
know
Karkaroff
doesn
strike
the
type
who
back
Voldemort
unless
knew
Voldemort
was
powerful
enough
protect
him
But
whoever
put
your
name
that
goblet
did
for
reason
and
can
help
thinking
the
tournament
would
very
good
way
attack
you
and
make
hook
like
accident
Looks
hike
really
good
plan
from
where
standing
said
Harry
grinning
bleaky
They
just
have
stand
back
and
let
the
dragons
their
stuff
Right
these
dragons
said
Sirius
speaking
very
quickly
now
There
way
Harry
Don
tempted
try
Stunning
Spell
dragons
are
strong
and
too
powerfully
magical
knocked
out
single
Stunner
you
need
about
half
dozen
wizards
time
overcome
dragon
Yeah
know
just
saw
said
Harry
But
you
can
alone
said
Sirius
There
away
and
simple
spell
all
you
need
Just
But
Harry
held
hand
silence
him
his
heart
suddenly
pounding
though
would
burst
could
hear
footsteps
coming
down
the
spiral
staircase
behind
him
hissed
Sirius
There
someone
coming
Harry
scrambled
his
feet
hiding
the
fire
someone
saw
Sirius
face
within
the
walls
Hogwarts
they
would
raise
almighty
uproar
the
Ministry
would
get
dragged
Harry
would
questioned
about
Sirius
whereabouts
Harry
heard
tiny
pop
the
fire
behind
him
and
knew
Sirius
had
gone
watched
the
bottom
the
spiral
staircase
Who
had
decided
for
stroll
one
clock
the
morning
and
stopped
Sirius
from
telling
him
how
get
past
dragon
was
Ron
Dressed
his
maroon
paisley
pajamas
Ron
stopped
dead
facing
Harry
across
the
room
and
looked
around
Who
were
you
talking
said
What
that
got
with
you
Harry
snarled
What
are
you
doing
down
here
this
time
night
just
wondered
where
you
Ron
broke
off
shrugging
Nothing
going
back
bed
Just
thought
you
come
nosing
around
did
you
Harry
shouted
knew
that
Ron
had
idea
what
walked
knew
hadn
done
purpose
but
didn
care
this
moment
hated
everything
about
Ron
right
down
the
several
inches
bare
ankle
showing
beneath
his
pajama
trousers
Sorry
about
that
said
Ron
his
face
reddening
with
anger
Should
realized
you
didn
want
disturbed
let
you
get
with
practicing
for
your
next
interview
peace
Harry
seized
one
the
POTTER
REALLY
STINKS
badges
off
the
table
and
chucked
hard
could
across
the
room
hit
Ron
the
forehead
and
bounced
off
There
you
Harry
said
Something
for
you
wear
Tuesday
You
might
even
have
scar
now
yon
lucky
That
what
you
want
isn
strode
across
the
room
toward
the
stairs
half
expected
Ron
stop
him
would
even
have
liked
Ron
throw
punch
him
but
Ron
just
stood
there
his
too
small
pajamas
and
Harry
having
stormed
upstairs
lay
awake
bed
fuming
for
long
time
afterward
and
didn
hear
him
come
bed
CHAPTER
TWENTY
THE
FIRST
TASK
Harry
got
Sunday
morning
and
dressed
inattentively
that
was
while
before
realized
was
trying
pull
his
hat
onto
his
foot
instead
his
sock
When
finally
got
all
his
clothes
the
right
parts
his
body
hurried
off
find
Hermione
locating
her
the
Gryffindor
table
the
Great
Hall
where
she
was
eating
breakfast
with
Ginny
Feeling
too
queasy
eat
Harry
waited
until
Hermione
had
swallowed
her
last
spoonful
porridge
then
dragged
her
out
onto
the
grounds
There
told
her
all
about
the
dragons
and
about
everything
Sirius
had
said
while
they
took
another
long
walk
around
the
lake
Alarmed
she
was
Sirius
warnings
about
Karkaroff
Hermione
still
thought
that
the
dragons
were
the
more
pressing
problem
Let
just
try
and
keep
you
alive
until
Tuesday
evening
she
said
desperately
and
then
can
worry
about
Karkaroff
They
walked
three
times
around
the
lake
trying
all
the
way
think
simple
spell
that
would
subdue
dragon
Nothing
whatsoever
occurred
them
they
retired
the
library
instead
Here
Harry
pulled
down
every
book
could
find
dragons
and
both
them
set
work
searching
through
the
large
pile
Talon
clipping
charms
treating
scale
rot
This
good
this
for
nutters
like
Hagrid
who
want
keep
them
healthy
Dragons
are
extremely
difficult
slay
owing
the
ancient
magic
that
imbues
their
thick
hides
which
none
but
the
most
powerful
spells
can
penetrate
But
Sirius
said
simple
one
would
Let
try
some
simple
spellbooks
then
said
Harry
throwing
aside
Men
Who
Love
Dragons
Too
Much
returned
the
table
with
pile
spellbooks
set
them
down
and
began
flick
through
each
turn
Hermione
whispering
nonstop
his
elbow
Well
there
are
Switching
Spells
but
what
the
point
Switching
Unless
you
swapped
its
fangs
for
wine
gums
something
that
would
make
less
dangerous
The
trouble
like
that
book
said
not
much
going
get
through
dragon
hide
say
Transfigure
but
something
that
big
you
really
haven
got
hope
doubt
even
Professor
McGonagall
unless
you
supposed
put
the
spell
yourself
Maybe
give
yourself
extra
powers
But
they
not
simple
spells
mean
haven
done
any
those
class
only
know
about
them
because
been
doing
practice
papers
Hermione
Harry
said
through
gritted
teeth
will
you
shut
for
bit
please
trying
concentrate
But
all
that
happened
when
Hermione
fell
silent
was
that
Harry
brain
filled
with
sort
blank
buzzing
which
didn
seem
allow
room
for
concentration
stared
hopelessly
down
the
index
Basic
Hexes
for
the
Busy
and
Vexed
Instant
scalping
but
dragons
had
hair
pepper
breath
that
would
probably
increase
dragon
firepower
horn
tongue
just
what
needed
give
extra
weapon
back
again
why
can
read
his
stupid
ship
said
Hermione
irritably
Viktor
Krum
slouched
cast
surly
look
over
the
pair
them
and
settled
himself
distant
corner
with
pile
books
Come
Harry
back
the
common
room
his
fan
club
here
moment
twittering
away
And
sure
enough
they
left
the
library
gang
girls
tiptoed
past
them
one
them
wearing
Bulgaria
scarf
tied
around
her
waist
Harry
barely
slept
that
night
When
awoke
Monday
morning
seriously
considered
for
the
first
time
ever
just
running
away
from
Hogwarts
But
looked
around
the
Great
Hall
breakfast
time
and
thought
about
what
leaving
the
castle
would
mean
knew
couldn
was
the
only
place
had
ever
been
happy
well
supposed
must
have
been
happy
with
his
parents
too
but
couldn
remember
that
Somehow
the
knowledge
that
would
rather
here
and
facing
dragon
than
back
Privet
Drive
with
Dudley
was
good
know
made
him
feel
slightly
calmer
finished
his
bacon
with
difficulty
his
throat
wasn
working
too
well
and
and
Hermione
got
saw
Cedric
Diggory
leaving
the
Hufflepuff
table
Cedric
still
didn
know
about
the
dragons
the
only
champion
who
didn
Harry
was
right
thinking
that
Maxime
and
Karkaroff
would
have
told
Fleur
and
Krum
Hermione
see
you
the
greenhouses
Harry
said
coming
his
decision
watched
Cedric
leaving
the
Hall
catch
you
Harry
you
late
the
bell
about
ring
catch
you
okay
the
time
Harry
reached
the
bottom
the
marble
staircase
Cedric
was
the
top
was
with
load
sixth
year
friends
Harry
didn
want
talk
Cedric
front
them
they
were
among
those
who
had
been
quoting
Rita
Skeeter
article
him
every
time
went
near
them
followed
Cedric
distance
and
saw
that
was
heading
toward
the
Charms
corridor
This
gave
Harry
idea
Pausing
distance
from
them
pulled
out
his
wand
and
took
careful
aim
Diffindo
Cedric
bag
split
Parchment
quills
and
books
spilled
out
onto
the
floor
Several
bottles
ink
smashed
Don
bother
said
Cedric
exasperated
voice
his
friends
bent
down
help
him
Tell
Flitwick
coming
This
was
exactly
what
Harry
had
been
hoping
for
slipped
his
wand
back
into
his
robes
waited
until
Cedric
friends
had
disappeared
into
their
classroom
and
hurried
the
corridor
which
was
now
empty
everyone
but
himself
and
Cedric
said
Cedric
picking
copy
Guide
Advanced
Transfiguration
that
was
now
splattered
with
ink
bag
just
split
brand
new
and
all
Cedric
said
Harry
the
first
task
dragons
What
said
Cedric
looking
Dragons
said
Harry
speaking
quickly
case
Professor
Flitwick
came
out
see
where
Cedric
had
got
They
got
four
one
for
each
and
got
get
past
them
Cedric
stared
him
Harry
saw
some
the
panic
been
feeling
since
Saturday
night
flickering
Cedric
gray
eyes
Are
you
sure
Cedric
said
hushed
voice
Dead
sure
said
Harry
seen
them
But
how
did
you
find
out
not
supposed
know
Never
mind
said
Harry
quickly
knew
Hagrid
would
trouble
told
the
truth
But
not
the
only
one
who
knows
Fleur
and
Krum
will
know
now
Maxime
and
Karkaroff
both
saw
the
dragons
too
Cedric
straightened
his
arms
full
inky
quills
parchment
and
books
his
ripped
bag
dangling
off
one
shoulder
stared
Harry
and
there
was
puzzled
almost
suspicious
look
his
eyes
Why
are
you
telling
asked
Harry
looked
him
disbelief
was
sure
Cedric
wouldn
have
asked
that
had
seen
the
dragons
himself
Harry
wouldn
have
let
his
worst
enemy
face
those
monsters
unprepared
well
perhaps
Malfoy
Snape
just
fair
isn
said
Cedric
all
know
now
even
footing
aren
Cedric
was
still
hooking
him
slightly
suspicious
way
when
Harry
heard
familiar
clunking
noise
behind
him
turned
around
and
saw
Mad
Eye
Moody
emerging
from
nearby
classroom
Come
with
Potter
growled
Diggory
off
you
Harry
stared
apprehensively
Moody
Had
overheard
them
Professor
supposed
Herbology
Never
mind
that
Potter
office
please
Harry
followed
him
wondering
what
was
going
happen
him
now
What
Moody
wanted
know
how
found
out
about
the
dragons
Would
Moody
Dumbledore
and
tell
Hagrid
just
turn
Harry
into
ferret
Well
might
easier
get
past
dragon
were
ferret
Harry
thought
dully
smaller
much
less
easy
see
from
height
fifty
feet
followed
Moody
into
his
office
Moody
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
turned
look
Harry
his
magical
eye
fixed
upon
him
well
the
normal
one
That
was
very
decent
thing
you
just
did
Potter
Moody
said
quietly
Harry
didn
know
what
say
this
wasn
the
reaction
had
expected
all
Sit
down
said
Moody
and
Harry
sat
looking
around
had
visited
this
office
under
two
its
previous
occupants
Professor
Lockhart
day
the
walls
had
been
plastered
with
beaming
winking
pictures
Professor
Lockhart
himself
When
Lupin
had
lived
here
you
were
more
likely
come
across
specimen
some
fascinating
new
Dark
creature
had
procured
for
them
study
class
Now
however
the
office
was
full
number
exceptionally
odd
objects
that
Harry
supposed
Moody
had
used
the
days
when
had
been
Auror
his
desk
stood
what
looked
hike
large
cracked
glass
spinning
top
Harry
recognized
once
Sneakoscope
because
owned
one
himself
though
was
much
smaller
than
Moody
the
corner
small
table
stood
object
that
looked
something
like
extra
squiggly
golden
television
aerial
was
humming
slightly
What
appeared
mirror
hung
opposite
Harry
the
wall
but
was
not
reflecting
the
room
Shadowy
figures
were
moving
around
inside
none
them
clearly
focus
Like
Dark
Detectors
you
aid
Moody
who
was
watching
Harry
closely
What
that
Harry
asked
pointing
the
squiggly
golden
aerial
Secrecy
Sensor
Vibrates
when
detects
concealment
and
lies
use
here
course
too
much
interference
students
every
direction
lying
about
why
they
haven
done
their
homework
Been
humming
ever
since
got
here
had
disable
Sneakoscope
because
wouldn
stop
whistling

sensitive
picks
stuff

mile
around

added
growl
And
what
the
mirror
for
that
Foe
Glass
See
them
out
there
skulking
around
not
really
trouble
until
see
the
whites
their
eyes
That
when
open
trunk
let
out
short
harsh
laugh
and
pointed
the
large
trunk
under
the
window
had
seven
keyholes
row
Harry
wondered
what
was
there
until
Moody
next
question
brought
him
sharply
back
earth
found
out
about
the
dragons
have
you
Harry
hesitated
been
afraid
this
but
hadn
told
Cedric
and
certainly
wasn
going
tell
Moody
that
Hagrid
had
broken
the
rules
all
right
said
Moody
sitting
down
and
stretching
out
his
wooden
leg
with
groan
Cheating
traditional
part
the
Triwizard
Tournament
and
always
has
been
didn
cheat
said
Harry
sharply
was
sort
accident
that
found
out
Moody
grinned
wasn
accusing
you
laddie
been
telling
Dumbledore

the
start
can
high
minded
likes
but
you
can
bet
old
Karkaroff
and
Maxime
won
They
have
told
their
champions
everything
they
can
They
want
win
They
want
beat
Dumbledore
They
like
prove
only
human
Moody
gave
another
harsh
laugh
and
his
magical
eye
swiveled
around
fast
made
Harry
feel
queasy
watch
got
any
ideas
how
you
going
get
past
your
dragon
yet
said
Moody
said
Harry
Well
not
going
tell
you
said
Moody
gruffly
don
show
favoritism
just
going
give
you
some
good
general
advice
And
the
first
bit
play

strengths

Harry
before
could
stop
himself
Excuse
growled
Moody

Think

What

you
best
Harry
tried
concentrate
What
was
best
Well

was
easy
really
Quidditch
said
dully
and
fat
lot

That
right
said
Moody
staring
him
very
hard
his
magical
eye
barely
moving
all
You
damn
good
flier
from
what
heard
Yeah
but
Harry
stared
him

Moody
loudly
interrupting
him

Harry
looked
him
blankly
What

Moody

And

Hermione
Harry
whispered
when
had
sped
into
greenhouse
three
minutes
later
uttering
hurried
apology
Professor
Sprout
passed
her
Hermione
need

help
What
you
think
been
trying
Harry
she
whispered
back
her
eyes
round
with
anxiety
over
the
top
the
quivering
Flutterby
Bush
she
was
pruning
Hermione
need
learn
how
Summoning
Charm
properly
tomorrow
afternoon
And
they
practiced
They
didn
have
lunch
but
headed
for
free
classroom
where
Harry
tried
with
all
his
might
make
various
objects
fly
across
the
room
toward
him
was
still
having
problems
The
books
and
quills
kept
losing
heart
halfway
across
the
room
and
dropping
hike
stones
the
floor
Concentrate
Harry
concentrate
What
you
think

said
Harry
angrily
great
big
dragon
keeps
popping
head
for
some
reason
Okay
try
again
wanted
skip
Divination
keep
practicing
but
Hermione
refused
point
blank
skive
off
Arithmancy
and
there
was
point
staying
without
her
therefore
had
endure
over
hour
Professor
Trelawney
who
spent
half
the
lesson
telling
everyone
that
the
position
Mars
with
relation
Saturn
that
moment
meant
that
people
born
July
were
great
danger
sudden
violent
deaths
Well
that
good
said
Harry
loudly
his
temper
getting
the
better
him
just
long
not
drawn
out
don
want
suffer
Ron
looked
for
moment
though
was
going
laugh
certainly
caught
Harry
eye
for
the
first
time
days
but
Harry
was
still
feeling
too
resentful
toward
Ron
care
spent
the
rest
the
lesson
trying
attract
small
objects
toward
him
under
the
table
with
his
wand
managed
make
fly
zoom
straight
into
his
hand
though
wasn
entirely
sure
that
was
his
prowess
Summoning
Charms
perhaps
the
fly
was
just
stupid
forced
down
some
dinner
after
Divination
then
returned
the
empty
classroom
with
Hermione
using
the
Invisibility
Cloak
avoid
the
teachers
They
kept
practicing
until
past
midnight
They
would
have
stayed
longer
but
Peeves
turned
and
pretending
think
that
Harry
wanted
things
thrown
him
started
chucking
chairs
across
the
room
Harry
and
Hermione
left
hurry
before
the
noise
attracted
Filch
and
went
back
the
Gryffindor
common
room
which
was
now
mercifully
empty
two
clock
the
morning
Harry
stood
near
the
fireplace
surrounded
heaps
objects
books
quills
several
upturned
chairs
old
set
Gobstones
and
Neville
toad
Trevor
Only
the
last
hour
had
Harry
really
got
the
hang
the
Summoning
Charm
That
better
Harry
that
loads
better
Hermione
said
looking
exhausted
but
very
pleased
Well
now
know
what
next
time
can
manage
spell
Harry
said
throwing
rune
dictionary
back
Hermione
could
try
again
threaten
with
dragon
Right
raised
his
wand
once
more
Accio
Dictionary
The
heavy
book
soared
out
Hermione
hand
flew
across
the
room
and
Harry
caught
Harry
really
think
you
got
said
Hermione
delightedly
Just
long
works

Harry
said
The
Firebolt
going
much
farther
away
than
the
stuff
here
going
the
castle
and
going
out
there
the
grounds
That
doesn
matter
said
Hermione
firmly
Just
long
you
concentrating
really
really
hard
come
Harry
better
get
some
sleep
you
going
need
Harry
had
been
focusing
hard
learning
the
Summoning
Charm
that
evening
that
some
his
blind
panic
had
heft
him
returned
full
measure
however
the
following
morning
The
atmosphere
the
school
was
one
great
tension
and
excitement
Lessons
were
stop
midday
giving
all
the
students
time
get
down
the
dragons
enclosure
though
course
they
didn
yet
know
what
they
would
find
there
Harry
felt
oddly
separate
from
everyone
around
him
whether
they
were
wishing
him
good
luck
hissing
have
box
tissues
ready
Potter
passed
was
state
nervousness
advanced
that
wondered
whether
mightn
just
lose
his
head
when
they
tried
lead
him
out
his
dragon
and
start
trying
curse
everyone
sight
Time
was
behaving
more
peculiar
fashion
than
ever
rushing
past
great
dollops
that
one
moment
seemed
sitting
down
his
first
lesson
History
Magic
and
the
next
walking
into
lunch
and
then
where
had
the
morning
gone
the
last
the
dragon
free
hours
Professor
McGonagall
was
hurrying
over
him
the
Great
Hall
Lots
people
were
watching
Potter
the
champions
have
come
down
onto
the
grounds
now
You
have
get
ready
for
your
first
task
Okay
said
Harry
standing
his
fork
falling
onto
his
plate
with
clatter
Good
luck
Harry
Hermione
whispered
You
fine
Yeah
said
Harry
voice
that
was
most
unlike
his
own
heft
the
Great
Hall
with
Professor
McGonagall
She
didn
seem
herself
either
fact
she
looked
nearly
anxious
Hermione
she
walked
him
down
the
stone
steps
and
out
into
the
cold
November
afternoon
she
put
her
hand
his
shoulder
Now
don
panic
she
said
just
keep
cool
head
got
wizards
standing
control
the
situation
gets
out
hand
The
main
thing
just
your
best
and
nobody
will
think
any
the
worse
you
Are
you
all
right
Yes
Harry
heard
himself
say
Yes
fine
She
was
leading
him
toward
the
place
where
the
dragons
were
around
the
edge
the
forest
but
when
they
approached
the
clump
trees
behind
which
the
enclosure
would
clearly
visible
Harry
saw
that
tent
had
been
erected
its
entrance
facing
them
screening
the
dragons
from
view
You
here
with
the
other
champions
said
Professor
McGonagall
rather
shaky
sort
voice
and
wait
for
your
turn
Potter
Bagman
there
telling
you
the
the
procedure
Good
luck
Thanks
said
Harry
flat
distant
voice
She
left
him
the
entrance
the
tent
Harry
went
inside
Fleur
Delacour
was
sitting
corner
how
wooden
stool
She
didn
look
nearly
composed
usual
but
rather
pale
and
clammy
Viktor
Krum
looked
even
surlier
than
usual
which
Harry
supposed
was
his
way
showing
nerves
Cedric
was
pacing
and
down
When
Harry
entered
Cedric
gave
him
small
smile
which
Harry
returned
feeling
the
muscles
his
face
working
rather
hard
though
they
had
forgotten
how
Harry
Good
said
Bagman
happily
looking
around
him
Come
come
make
yourself
home
Bagman
looked
somehow
like
slightly
overblown
cartoon
figure
standing
amid
all
the
pale
faced
champions
was
wearing
his
old
Wasp
robes
again
Well
now
all
here
time
fill
you
said
Bagman
brightly
When
the
audience
has
assembled
going
offering
each
you
this
bag
held
small
sack
purple
silk
and
shook
them
from
which
you
will
each
select
small
model
the
thing
you
are
about
face
There
are
different
varieties
you
see
And
have
tell
you
something
else
too
yes
your
task
collect
the
golden
egg
Harry
glanced
around
Cedric
had
nodded
once
show
that
understood
Bagman
words
and
then
started
pacing
around
the
tent
again
looked
slightly
green
Fleur
Delacour
and
Krum
hadn
reacted
all
Perhaps
they
thought
they
might
sick
they
opened
their
mouths
that
was
certainly
how
Harry
felt
But
they
least
had
volunteered
for
this
And
time
all
hundreds
upon
hundreds
pairs
feet
could
heard
passing
the
tent
their
owners
talking
excitedly
laughing
joking
Harry
felt
separate
from
the
crowd
though
they
were
different
species
And
then
seemed
like
about
second
later
Harry
Bagman
was
opening
the
neck
the
purple
silk
sack
Ladies
first
said
offering
Fleur
Delacour
She
put
shaking
hand
inside
the
bag
and
drew
out
tiny
perfect
model
dragon
Welsh
Green
had
the
number
two
around
its
neck
And
Harry
knew
the
fact
that
Fleur
showed
sign
surprise
but
rather
determined
resignation
that
had
been
right
Madame
Maxime
had
told
her
what
was
coming
The
same
held
true
for
Krum
pulled
out
the
scarlet
Chinese
Fireball
had
number
three
around
its
neck
didn
even
blink
just
sat
back
down
and
stared
the
ground
Cedric
put
his
hand
into
the
bag
and
out
came
the
blueish
gray
Swedish
Short
Snout
the
number
one
tied
around
its
neck
Knowing
what
was
left
Harry
put
his
hand
into
the
silk
bag
and
pulled
out
the
Hungarian
Horntail
and
the
number
four
stretched
its
wings
looked
down
and
bared
its
minuscule
fangs
Well
there
you
are
said
Bagman
You
have
each
pulled
out
the
dragon
you
will
face
and
the
numbers
refer
the
order
which
you
are
take
the
dragons
you
see
Now
going
have
leave
you
moment
because
commentating
Diggory
you
first
just
out
into
the
enclosure
when
you
hear
whistle
all
right
Now
Harry
could
have
quick
word
Outside
yes
said
Harry
blankly
and
got
and
went
out
the
tent
with
Bagman
who
walked
him
short
distance
away
into
the
trees
and
then
turned
him
with
fatherly
expression
his
face
Feeling
all
right
Harry
Anything
can
get
you
What
said
Harry
nothing
Got
plan
said
Bagman
lowering
his
voice
conspiratorially
Because
don
mind
sharing
few
pointers
you
like
them
you
know
mean
Bagman
continued
lowering
his
voice
still
further
you
the
underdog
here
Harry
Anything
can
help
said
Harry
quickly
knew
had
sounded
rude
know
what
going
thanks
Nobody
would
know
Harry
said
Bagman
winking
him
fine
said
Harry
wondering
why
kept
telling
people
this
and
wondering
whether
had
ever
been
less
fine
got
plan
worked
out
whistle
had
blown
somewhere
Good
lord
got
run
said
Bagman
alarm
and
hurried
off
Harry
walked
back
the
tent
and
saw
Cedric
emerging
from
greener
than
ever
Harry
tried
wish
him
luck
walked
past
but
all
that
came
out
his
mouth
was
sort
hoarse
grunt
Harry
went
back
inside
Fleur
and
Krum
Seconds
hater
they
heard
the
roar
the
crowd
which
meant
Cedric
had
entered
the
enclosure
and
was
now
face
face
with
the
living
counterpart
his
model
was
worse
than
Harry
could
ever
have
imagined
sitting
there
and
listening
The
crowd
screamed
yelled
gasped
like
single
many
headed
entity
Cedric
did
whatever
was
doing
get
past
the
Swedish
Short
Snout
Krum
was
still
staring
the
ground
Fleur
had
now
taken
retracing
Cedric
steps
around
and
around
the
tent
And
Bagman
commentary
made
everything
much
much
worse
Horrible
pictures
formed
Harry
mind
heard
Oooh
narrow
miss
there
very
narrow
taking
risks
this
one
Clever
move
pity
didn
work
And
then
after
about
fifteen
minutes
Harry
heard
the
deafening
roar
that
could
mean
only
one
thing
Cedric
had
gotten
past
his
dragon
and
captured
the
golden
egg
Very
good
indeed
Bagman
was
shouting
And
now
the
marks
from
the
judges
But
didn
shout
out
the
marks
Harry
supposed
the
judges
were
holding
them
and
showing
them
the
crowd
One
down
three
Bagman
yelled
the
whistle
blew
again
Miss
Delacour
you
please
Fleur
was
trembling
from
head
foot
Harry
felt
more
warmly
toward
her
than
had
done
far
she
heft
the
tent
with
her
head
held
high
and
her
hand
clutching
her
wand
and
Krum
were
left
alone
opposite
sides
the
tent
avoiding
each
other
gaze
The
same
process
started
again
not
sure
that
was
wise
they
could
hear
Bagman
shouting
gleefully
nearly
Careful
now
good
lord
thought
she
had
then
Ten
minutes
later
Harry
heard
the
crowd
erupt
into
applause
once
more
Fleur
must
have
been
successful
too
pause
while
Fleur
marks
were
being
shown
more
clapping
then
for
the
third
time
the
whistle
And
here
comes
Krum
cried
Bagman
and
Krum
slouched
out
leaving
Harry
quite
alone
felt
much
more
aware
his
body
than
usual
very
aware
the
way
his
heart
was
pumping
fast
and
his
fingers
tingling
with
fear
yet
the
same
time
seemed
outside
himself
seeing
the
walls
the
tent
and
hearing
the
crowd
though
from
far
away
Very
daring
Bagman
was
yelling
and
Harry
heard
the
Chinese
Fireball
emit
horrible
roaring
shriek
while
the
crowd
drew
its
collective
breath
That
some
nerve
showing
and
yes
got
the
egg
Applause
shattered
the
wintery
air
like
breaking
glass
Krum
had
finished
would
Harry
turn
any
moment
stood
noticing
dimly
that
his
legs
seemed
made
marshmallow
waited
And
then
heard
the
whistle
blow
walked
out
through
the
entrance
the
tent
the
panic
rising
into
crescendo
inside
him
And
now
was
walking
past
the
trees
through
gap
the
enclosure
fence
saw
everything
front
him
though
was
very
highly
colored
dream
There
were
hundreds
and
hundreds
faces
staring
down
him
from
stands
that
had
been
magicked
there
since
last
stood
this
spot
And
there
was
the
Horntail
the
other
end
the
enclosure
crouched
low
over
her
clutch
eggs
her
wings
half
furled
her
evil
yellow
eyes
upon
him
monstrous
scaly
black
lizard
thrashing
her
spiked
tail
heaving
yard
long
gouge
marks
the
hard
ground
The
crowd
was
making
great
deal
noise
but
whether
friendly
not
Harry
didn
know
care
was
time
what
had
focus
his
mind
entirely
and
absolutely
upon
the
thing
that
was
his
only
chance
raised
his
wand
Accio
Firebolt
shouted
Harry
waited
every
fiber
him
hoping
praying
hadn
worked
wasn
coming
seemed
looking
everything
around
him
through
some
sort
shimmering
transparent
barrier
like
heat
haze
which
made
the
enclosure
and
the
hundreds
faces
around
him
swim
strangely
And
then
heard
speeding
through
the
air
behind
him
turned
and
saw
his
Firebolt
hurtling
toward
him
around
the
edge
the
woods
soaring
into
the
enclosure
and
stopping
dead
midair
beside
him
waiting
for
him
mount
The
crowd
was
making
even
more
noise
Bagman
was
shouting
something
but
Harry
ears
were
not
working
properly
anymore
listening
wasn
important
swung
his
leg
over
the
broom
and
kicked
off
from
the
ground
And
second
later
something
miraculous
happened
soared
upward
the
wind
rushed
through
his
hair
the
crowd
faces
became
mere
flesh
colored
pinpnicks
below
and
the
Horntail
shrank
the
size
dog
realized
that
had
heft
not
only
the
ground
behind
but
also
his
fear
was
back
where
belonged
This
was
just
another
Quidditch
match
that
was
all
just
another
Quidditch
match
and
that
Horntail
was
just
another
ugly
opposing
team
looked
down
the
clutch
eggs
and
spotted
the
gold
one
gleaming
against
its
cement
colored
fellows
residing
safely
between
the
dragon
front
legs
Okay
Harry
told
himself
diversionary
tactics
let
dived
The
Horntail
head
followed
him
knew
what
was
going
and
pulled
out
the
dive
just
time
jet
fire
had
been
released
exactly
where
would
have
been
had
not
swerved
away
but
Harry
didn
care
that
was
more
than
dodging
Bludger
Great
Scott
can
fly
yelled
Bagman
the
crowd
shrieked
and
gasped
Are
you
watching
this
Krum
Harry
soared
higher
circle
the
Horntail
was
still
following
his
progress
its
head
revolving
its
long
neck
kept
this
would
nicely
dizzy
but
better
not
push
too
long
would
breathing
fire
again
Harry
plummeted
just
the
Horntail
opened
its
mouth
but
this
time
was
less
lucky
missed
the
flames
but
the
tail
came
whipping
meet
him
instead
and
swerved
the
left
one
the
long
spikes
grazed
his
shoulder
ripping
his
robes
could
feel
stinging
could
hear
screaming
and
groans
from
the
crowd
but
the
cut
didn
seem
deep
Now
zoomed
around
the
back
the
Horntail
and
possibility
occurred
him
The
Horntail
didn
seem
want
take
off
she
was
too
protective
her
eggs
Though
she
writhed
and
twisted
furling
and
unfurling
her
wings
and
keeping
those
fearsome
yellow
eyes
Harry
she
was
afraid
move
too
far
from
them
but
had
persuade
her
never
get
near
them
The
trick
was
carefully
gradually
began
fly
first
this
way
then
the
other
not
near
enough
make
her
breathe
fire
stave
him
off
but
still
posing
sufficient
threat
ensure
she
kept
her
eyes
him
Her
head
swayed
this
way
and
that
watching
him
out
those
vertical
pupils
her
fangs
bared
flew
higher
The
Horntail
head
rose
with
him
her
neck
now
stretched
its
fullest
extent
still
swaying
hike
snake
before
its
charmer
Harry
rose
few
more
feet
and
she
let
out
roar
exasperation
was
like
fly
her
fly
she
was
longing
swat
her
tail
thrashed
again
but
was
too
high
reach
now
She
shot
fire
into
the
air
which
dodged
Her
jaws
opened
wide
Come
Harry
hissed
swerving
tantalizingly
above
her
come
come
and
get
you
get
now
And
then
she
reared
spreading
her
great
black
leathery
wings
last
wide
those
small
airplane
and
Harry
dived
Before
the
dragon
knew
what
had
done
where
had
disappeared
was
speeding
toward
the
ground
fast
could
toward
the
eggs
now
unprotected
her
clawed
front
legs
had
taken
his
hands
off
his
Firebolt
had
seized
the
golden
egg
And
with
huge
spurt
speed
was
off
was
soaring
out
over
the
stands
the
heavy
egg
safely
under
his
uninjured
arm
and
was
though
somebody
had
just
turned
the
volume
back
for
the
first
time
became
properly
aware
the
noise
the
crowd
which
was
screaming
and
applauding
loudly
the
Irish
supporters
the
World
Cup
Look
that
Bagman
was
yelling
Will
you
look
that
Our
youngest
champion
quickest
get
his
egg
Well
this
going
shorten
the
odds
Potter
Harry
saw
the
dragon
keepers
rushing
forward
subdue
the
Horntail
and
over
the
entrance
the
enclosure
Professor
McGonagalh
Professor
Moody
and
Hagrid
hurrying
meet
him
all
them
waving
him
toward
them
their
smiles
evident
even
from
this
distance
flew
back
over
the
stands
the
noise
the
crowd
pounding
his
eardrums
and
came
smoothly
land
his
heart
lighter
than
had
been
weeks
had
got
through
the
first
task
had
survived
That
was
excellent
Potter
cried
Professor
McGonagall
got
off
the
Firebolt
which
from
her
was
extravagant
praise
noticed
that
her
hand
shook
she
pointed
his
shoulder
You
need
see
Madam
Pomfrey
before
the
judges
give
out
your
score
Over
there
she
had
mop
Diggory
already
Yeh
did
Harry
said
Hagrid
hoarsely
Yeh
did
agains
the
Horntail
all
yeh
know
Charlie
said
that
was
the
wors
Thanks
Hagrid
said
Harry
loudly
that
Hagrid
wouldn
blunder
and
reveal
that
had
shown
Harry
the
dragons
beforehand
Professor
Moody
looked
very
pleased
too
his
magical
eye
was
dancing
its
socket
Nice
and
easy
does
the
trick
Potter
growled
Right
then
Potter
the
first
aid
tent
please
said
Professor
McGonagall
Harry
walked
out
the
enclosure
still
panting
and
saw
Madam
Pomfrey
standing
the
mouth
second
tent
looking
worried
Dragons
she
said
disgusted
tone
pulling
Harry
inside
The
tent
was
divided
into
cubicles
could
make
out
Cedric
shadow
through
the
canvas
but
Cedric
didn
seem
badly
injured
was
sitting
least
Madam
Pomfrey
examined
Harry
shoulder
talking
furiously
all
the
while
Last
year
dementors
this
year
dragons
what
are
they
going
bring
into
this
school
next
You
very
lucky
this
quite
shallow
need
cleaning
before
heal
though
She
cleaned
the
cut
with
dab
some
purple
liquid
that
smoked
and
stung
but
then
poked
his
shoulder
with
her
wand
and
felt
heal
instantly
Now
just
sit
quietly
for
minute
sit
And
then
you
can
and
get
your
score
She
bustled
out
the
tent
and
heard
her
next
door
and
say
How
does
feel
now
Diggory
Harry
didn
want
sit
still
was
too
full
adrenaline
got
his
feet
wanting
see
what
was
going
outside
but
before
reached
the
mouth
the
tent
two
people
had
come
darting
inside
Hermione
followed
closely
Ron
Harry
you
were
brilliant
Hermione
said
squeakily
There
were
fingernail
marks
her
face
where
she
had
been
clutching
fear
You
were
amazing
You
really
were
But
Harry
was
looking
Ron
who
was
very
white
and
staring
Harry
though
were
ghost
Harry
said
very
seriously
whoever
put
your
name
that
goblet
reckon
they
trying
you
was
though
the
last
few
weeks
had
never
happened
though
Harry
were
meeting
Ron
for
the
first
time
right
after
been
made
champion
Caught
have
you
said
Harry
coldly
Took
you
long
enough
Hermione
stood
nervously
between
them
looking
from
one
the
other
Ron
opened
his
mouth
uncertainly
Harry
knew
Ron
was
about
apologize
and
suddenly
found
didn
need
hear
okay
said
before
Ron
could
get
the
words
out
Forget
said
Ron
shouldn
Forget
Harry
said
Ron
grinned
nervously
him
and
Harry
grinned
back
Hermione
burst
into
tears
There
nothing
cry
about
Harry
told
her
bewildered
You
two
are
stupid
she
shouted
stamping
her
foot
the
ground
tears
splashing
down
her
front
Then
before
either
them
could
stop
her
she
had
given
both
them
hug
and
dashed
away
now
positively
howling
Barking
mad
said
Ron
shaking
his
head
Harry
mon
they
putting
your
scores
Picking
the
golden
egg
and
his
Firebolt
feeling
more
elated
than
would
have
believed
possible
hour
ago
Harry
ducked
out
the
tent
Ron
his
side
talking
fast
You
were
the
best
you
know
competition
Cedric
did
this
weird
thing
where
Transfigured
rock
the
ground
turned
into
dog
was
trying
make
the
dragon
for
the
dog
instead
him
Well
was
pretty
cool
bit
Transfiguration
and
sort
worked
because
did
get
the
egg
but
got
burned
well
the
dragon
changed
its
mind
halfway
through
and
decided
would
rather
have
him
than
the
Labrador
only
just
got
away
And
that
Fleur
girl
tried
this
sort
charm
think
she
was
trying
put
into
trance
well
that
kind
worked
too
went
all
sleepy
but
then
snored
and
this
great
jet
flame
shot
out
and
her
skirt
caught
fire
she
put
out
with
bit
water
out
her
wand
And
Krum
you
won
believe
this
but
didn
even
think
flying
was
probably
the
best
after
you
though
Hit
with
some
sort
spell
right
the
eye
Only
thing
went
trampling
around
agony
and
squashed
half
the
real
eggs
they
took
marks
off
for
that
wasn
supposed
any
damage
them
Ron
drew
breath
and
Harry
reached
the
edge
the
enclosure
Now
that
the
Horntail
had
been
taken
away
Harry
could
see
where
the
five
judges
were
sitting
right
the
other
end
raised
seats
draped
gold
marks
out
ten
from
each
one
Ron
said
and
Harry
squinting
the
field
saw
the
first
judge
Madame
Maxime
raise
her
wand
the
air
What
hooked
like
long
silver
ribbon
shot
out
which
twisted
itself
into
large
figure
eight
Not
bad
said
Ron
the
crowd
applauded
suppose
she
took
marks
off
for
your
shoulder
Crouch
came
next
shot
number
nine
into
the
air
Looking
good
Ron
yelled
thumping
Harry
the
back
Next
Dumbledore
too
put
nine
The
crowd
was
cheering
harder
than
ever
Ludo
Bagman
ten
Ten
said
Harry
disbelief
But
got
hurt
What
playing
Harry
don
complain
Ron
yelled
excitedly
And
now
Karkaroff
raised
his
wand
paused
for
moment
and
then
number
shot
out
his
wand
too
four
What
Ron
bellowed
furiously
Four
You
lousy
biased
scum
bag
you
gave
Krum
ten
But
Harry
didn
care
wouldn
have
cared
Karkaroff
had
given
him
zero
Ron
indignation
his
behalf
was
worth
about
hundred
points
him
didn
tell
Ron
this
course
but
his
heart
felt
lighter
than
air
turned
leave
the
enclosure
And
wasn
just
Ron
those
weren
only
Gryffindors
cheering
the
crowd
When
had
come
when
they
had
seen
what
was
facing
most
the
school
had
been
his
side
well
Cedric
didn
care
about
the
Slytherins
could
stand
whatever
they
threw
him
now
You
tied
first
place
Harry
You
and
Krum
said
Charlie
Weasley
hurrying
meet
them
they
set
off
back
toward
the
school
Listen

run
got
and
send
Mum
owl
swore
tell
her
what
happened
but
that
was
unbelievable
yeah
and
they
told
tell
you

got
hang
around
for
few
more
minutes
Bagman
wants
word
back
the
champions
tent
Ron
said
would
wait
Harry
reentered
the
tent
which
somehow
looked
quite
different
now
friendly
and
welcoming
thought
back
how
felt
while
dodging
the
Horntail
and
compared
the
long
wait
before
walked
out
face
There
was
comparison
the
wait
had
been
immeasurably
worse
Fleur
Cedric
and
Krum
all
came
together
One
side
Cedric
face
was
covered
thick
orange
paste
which
was
presumably
mending
his
burn
grinned
Harry
when
saw
him
Good
one
Harry
And
you
said
Harry
grinning
back
Well
done
all
you
said
Ludo
Bagman
bouncing
into
the
tent
and
looking
pleased
though
personally
had
just
got
past
dragon
Now
just
quick
few
words
You
got
nice
long
break
before
the
second
task
which
will
take
place
half
past
nine
the
morning
February
the
twenty
fourth
but
giving
you
something
think
about
the
meantime
you
look
down
those
golden
eggs
you
all
holding
you
will
see
that
they
open
see
the
hinges
there
You
need
solve
the
clue
inside
the
egg
because
will
tell
you
what
the
second
task
and
enable
you
prepare
for
All
clear
Sure
Well
off
you
then
Harry
left
the
tent
rejoined
Ron
and
they
started
walk
back
around
the
edge
the
forest
talking
hard
Harry
wanted
hear
what
the
other
champions
had
done
more
detail
Then
they
rounded
the
clump
trees
behind
which
Harry
had
first
heard
the
dragons
roar
witch
leapt
out
from
behind
them
was
Rita
Skeeter
She
was
wearing
acid
green
robes
today
the
Quick
Quotes
Quill
her
hand
blended
perfectly
against
them
Congratulations
Harry
she
said
beaming
him
wonder
you
could
give
quick
word
How
you
felt
facing
that
dragon
How
you
feel
now
about
the
fairness
the
scoring
Yeah
you
can
have
word
said
Harry
savagely
Good
bye
And
set
off
back
the
castle
with
Ron
CHAPTER
TWENTY
ONE
THE
HOUSE
ELF
LIBERATION
FRONT
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
went
the
Owlery
that
evening
find
Pigwidgeon
that
Harry
could
send
Sirius
letter
telling
him
that
had
managed
get
past
his
dragon
unscathed
the
way
Harry
filled
Ron
everything
Sirius
had
told
him
about
Karkaroff
Though
shocked
first
hear
that
Karkaroff
had
been
Death
Eater
the
time
they
entered
the
Owlery
Ron
was
saying
that
they
ought
have
suspected
all
along
Fits
doesn
said
Remember
what
Malfoy
said
the
train
about
his
dad
being
friends
with
Karkaroff
Now
know
where
they
knew
each
other
They
were
probably
running
around
masks
together
the
World
Cup
tell
you
one
thing
though
Harry
was
Karkaroff
who
put
your
name
the
goblet
going
feeling
really
stupid
now
isn
Didn
work
did
You
only
got
scratch
Come
here
Pigwidgeon
was
overexcited
the
idea
delivery
was
flying
around
and
around
Harry
head
hooting
incessantly
Ron
snatched
Pigwidgeon
out
the
air
and
held
him
still
while
Harry
attached
the
letter
his
leg
There
way
any
the
other
tasks
are
going
that
dangerous
how
could
they
Ron
went
carried
Pigwidgeon
the
window
You
know
what
reckon
you
could
win
this
tournament
Harry
serious
Harry
knew
that
Ron
was
only
saying
this
make
for
his
behavior
the
last
few
weeks
but
appreciated
all
the
same
Hermione
however
leaned
against
the
Owlery
wall
folded
her
arms
and
frowned
Ron
Harry
got
long
way
before
finishes
this
tournament
she
said
seriously
that
was
the
first
task
hate
think
what
coming
next
Right
little
ray
sunshine
aren
you
said
Ron
You
and
Professor
Trelawney
should
get
together
sometime
threw
Pigwidgeon
out
the
window
Pigwidgeon
plummeted
twelve
feet
before
managing
pull
himself
back
again
the
letter
attached
his
leg
was
much
longer
and
heavier
than
usual
Harry
hadn
been
able
resist
giving
Sirius
blow
blow
account
exactly
how
had
swerved
circled
and
dodged
the
Horntail
They
watched
Pigwidgeon
disappear
into
the
darkness
and
then
Ron
said
Well
better
get
downstairs
for
your
surprise
party
Harry
Fred
and
George
should
have
nicked
enough
food
from
the
kitchens
now
Sure
enough
when
they
entered
the
Gryffindor
common
room
exploded
with
cheers
and
yells
again
There
were
mountains
cakes
and
flagons
pumpkin
juice
and
butterbeer
every
surface
Lee
Jordan
had
let
off
some
Filibuster
Fireworks
that
the
air
was
thick
with
stars
and
sparks
and
Dean
Thomas
who
was
very
good
drawing
had
put
some
impressive
new
banners
most
which
depicted
Harry
zooming
around
the
Horntail
head
his
Firebolt
though
couple
showed
Cedric
with
his
head
fire
Harry
helped
himself
food
had
almost
forgotten
what
was
like
feel
properly
hungry
and
sat
down
with
Ron
and
Hermione
couldn
believe
how
happy
felt
had
Ron
back
his
side
gotten
through
the
first
task
and
wouldn
have
face
the
second
one
for
three
months
Blimey
this
heavy
said
Lee
Jordan
picking
the
golden
egg
which
Harry
had
left
table
and
weighing
his
hands
Open
Harry
Let
just
see
what
inside
supposed
work
out
the
clue
his
own
Hermione
said
swiftly
the
tournament
rules
was
supposed
work
out
how
get
past
the
dragon
own
too
Harry
muttered
only
Hermione
could
hear
him
and
she
grinned
rather
guiltily
Yeah
Harry
open
several
people
echoed
Lee
passed
Harry
the
egg
and
Harry
dug
his
fingernails
into
the
groove
that
ran
all
the
way
around
and
prised
open
was
hollow
and
completely
empty
but
the
moment
Harry
opened
the
most
horrible
noise
loud
and
screechy
wailing
filled
the
room
The
nearest
thing
Harry
had
ever
heard
was
the
ghost
orchestra
Nearly
Headless
Nick
deathday
party
who
had
all
been
playing
the
musical
saw
Shut
Fred
bellowed
his
hands
over
his
ears
What
was
that
said
Seamus
Finnigan
staring
the
egg
Harry
slammed
shut
again
Sounded
like
banshee
Maybe
you
got
get
past
one
those
next
Harry
was
someone
being
tortured
said
Neville
who
had
gone
very
white
and
spilled
sausage
rolls
all
over
the
floor
You
going
have
fight
the
Cruciatus
Curse
Don
prat
Neville
that
illegal
said
George
They
wouldn
use
the
Cruciatus
Curse
the
champions
thought
sounded
bit
like
Percy
singing
maybe
you
got
attack
him
while
the
shower
Harry
Want
jam
tart
Hermione
said
Fred
Hermione
looked
doubtfully
the
plate
was
offering
her
Fred
grinned
all
right
said
haven
done
anything
them
the
custard
creams
you
got
watch
Neville
who
had
just
bitten
into
custard
cream
choked
and
spat
out
Fred
laughed
Just
little
joke
Neville
Hermione
took
jam
tart
Then
she
said
Did
you
get
all
this
from
the
kitchens
Fred
Yep
said
Fred
grinning
her
put
high
pitched
squeak
and
imitated
house
elf
Anything

get

sir

all
They
dead
helpful

said
was
peckish
How

get
there
Hermione
said
innocently
casual
sort
voice
Easy
said
Fred
concealed
door
behind
painting
bowl
fruit
Just
tickle
the
pear
and
giggles
and
stopped
and
looked
suspiciously
her
Why
Nothing
said
Hermione
quickly
Going
try
and
lead
the
house
elves
out
strike
now
are
you
said
George
Going
give
all
the
leaflet
stuff
and
try
and
stir
them
into
rebellion
Several
people
chortled
Hermione
didn
answer
Don
you
upsetting
them
and
telling
them
they
got
take
clothes
and
salaries
said
Fred
warningly
You
put
them
off
their
cooking
Just
then
Neville
caused
slight
diversion
turning
into
large
canary
sorry
Neville
Fred
shouted
over
all
the
laughter
forgot
was
the
custard
creams
hexed
Within
minute
however
Neville
had
molted
and
once
his
feathers
had
fallen
off
reappeared
looking
entirely
normal
even
joined
laughing
Canary
Creams
Fred
shouted
the
excitable
crowd
George
and
invented
them
seven
Sickles
each
bargain
was
nearly
one
the
morning
when
Harry
finally
went
the
dormitory
with
Ron
Neville
Seamus
and
Dean
Before
pulled
the
curtains
his
four
poster
shut
Harry
set
his
tiny
model
the
Hungarian
Horntail
the
table
next
his
bed
where
yawned
curled
and
closed
its
eyes
Really
Harry
thought
pulled
the
hangings
his
four
poster
closed
Hagrid
had
point
they
were
all
right
really
dragons
The
start
December
brought
wind
and
sleet
Hogwarts
Drafty
though
the
castle
always
was
winter
Harry
was
glad
its
fires
and
thick
walls
every
time
passed
the
Durmstrang
ship
the
lake
which
was
pitching
the
high
winds
its
black
sails
billowing
against
the
dark
skies
thought
the
Beauxbatons
caravan
was
likely
pretty
chilly
too
Hagrid
noticed
was
keeping
Madame
Maxime
horses
well
provided
with
their
preferred
drink
single
malt
whiskey
the
fumes
wafting
from
the
trough
the
comer
their
paddock
was
enough
make
the
entire
Care
Magical
Creatures
class
light
headed
This
was
unhelpful
they
were
still
tending
the
horrible
skrewts
and
needed
their
wits
about
them
not
sure
whether
they
hibernate
not
Hagrid
told
the
shivering
class
the
windy
pumpkin
patch
next
lesson
Thought
jus
try
see
they
fancied
kip
jus
settle
down
these
boxes
There
were
now
only
ten
skrewts
left
apparently
their
desire
kill
one
another
had
not
been
exercised
out
them
Each
them
was
now
approaching
six
feet
length
Their
thick
gray
armor
their
powerful
scuttling
legs
their
fire
blasting
ends
their
stings
and
their
suckers
combined
make
the
skrewts
the
most
repulsive
things
Harry
had
ever
seen
The
class
looked
dispiritedly
the
enormous
boxes
Hagrid
had
brought
out
all
lined
with
pillows
and
fluffy
blankets
jus
lead
here
Hagrid
said
put
the
lids
and
see
what
happens
But
the
skrewts
transpired
did
not
hibernate
and
did
not
appreciate
being
forced
into
pillow
lined
boxes
and
nailed
Hagrid
was
soon
yelling
Don
panic
now
don
panic
while
the
skrewts
rampaged
around
the
pumpkin
patch
now
strewn
with
the
smoldering
wreckage
the
boxes
Most
the
class
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
the
lead
had
fled
into
Hagrid
cabin
through
the
back
door
and
barricaded
themselves
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
however
were
among
those
who
remained
outside
trying
help
Hagrid
Together
they
managed
restrain
and
tie
nine
the
skrewts
though
the
cost
numerous
burns
and
cuts
finally
only
one
skrewt
was
left
Don
frighten
him
now
Hagrid
shouted
Ron
and
Harry
used
their
wands
shoot
jets
fiery
sparks
the
skrewt
which
was
advancing
menacingly
them
its
sting
arched
quivering
over
its
back
Jus
try
slip
the
rope
round
his
sting
won
hurt
any
the
others
Yeah
wouldn
want
that
Ron
shouted
angrily
and
Harry
backed
into
the
wall
Hagrid
cabin
still
holding
the
skrewt
off
with
their
sparks
Well
well
well
this
does
look
like
fun
Rita
Skeeter
was
leaning
Hagrid
garden
fence
looking
the
mayhem
She
was
wearing
thick
magenta
cloak
with
furry
purple
collar
today
and
her
crocodile
skin
handbag
was
over
her
arm
Hagrid
launched
himself
forward
top
the
skrewt
that
was
cornering
Harry
and
Ron
and
flattened
blast
fire
shot
out
its
end
withering
the
pumpkin
plants
nearby
Who
you
Hagrid
asked
Rita
Skeeter
slipped
loop
rope
around
the
skrewt
sting
and
tightened
Rita
Skeeter
Daily
Prophet
reporter
Rita
replied
beaming
him
Her
gold
teeth
glinted
Thought
Dumbledore
said
you
weren
allowed
inside
the
school
anymore
said
Hagrid
frowning
slightly
got
off
the
slightly
squashed
skrewt
and
started
tugging
over
its
fellows
Rita
acted
though
she
hadn
heard
what
Hagrid
had
said
What
are
these
fascinating
creatures
called
she
asked
beaming
still
more
widely
Blast
Ended
Skrewts
grunted
Hagrid
Really
said
Rita
apparently
full
lively
interest
never
heard
them
before
where
they
come
from
Harry
noticed
dull
red
flush
rising
out
Hagrid
wild
black
beard
and
his
heart
sank
Where
had
Hagrid
got
the
skrewts
from
Hermione
who
seemed
thinking
along
these
lines
said
quickly
They
very
interesting
aren
they
Aren
they
Harry
What
yeah
ouch
interesting
said
Harry
she
stepped
his
foot
you
here
Harry
said
Rita
Skeeter
she
looked
around
you
like
Care
Magical
Creatures
you
One
your
favorite
lessons
Yes
said
Harry
stoutly
Hagrid
beamed
him
Lovely
said
Rita
Really
lovely
Been
teaching
long
she
added
Hagrid
Harry
noticed
her
eyes
travel
over
Dean
who
had
nasty
cut
across
one
cheek
Lavender
whose
robes
were
badly
singed
Seamus
who
was
nursing
several
burnt
fingers
and
then
the
cabin
windows
where
most
the
class
stood
their
noses
pressed
against
the
glass
waiting
see
the
coast
was
clear
This
second
year
said
Hagrid
Lovely
don
suppose
you
like
give
interview
would
you
Share
some
your
experience
magical
creatures
The
Prophet
does
zoological
column
every
Wednesday
sure
you
know
could
feature
these
Bang
Ended
Scoots
Blast
Ended
Skrewts
Hagrid
said
eagerly
yeah
why
not
Harry
had
very
bad
feeling
about
this
but
there
was
way
communicating
Hagrid
without
Rita
Skeeter
seeing
had
stand
and
watch
silence
Hagrid
and
Rita
Skeeter
made
arrangements
meet
the
Three
Broomsticks
for
good
long
interview
later
that
week
Then
the
bell
rang
the
castle
signaling
the
end
the
lesson
Well
good
bye
Harry
Rita
Skeeter
called
merrily
him
set
off
with
Ron
and
Hermione
Until
Friday
night
then
Hagrid
She
twist
everything
says
Harry
said
under
his
breath
Just
long
didn
import
those
skrewts
illegally
anything
said
Hermione
desperately
They
looked
one
another
was
exactly
the
sort
thing
Hagrid
might
Hagrids
been
loads
trouble
before
and
Dumbledores
never
sacked
him
said
Ron
consolingly
Worst
that
can
happen
Hagrid
have
get
rid
the
skrewts
Sorry
did
say
worst
meant
best
Harry
and
Hermione
laughed
and
feeling
slightly
more
cheerful
went
off
lunch
Harry
thoroughly
enjoyed
double
Divination
that
afternoon
they
were
still
doing
star
charts
and
predictions
but
now
that
and
Ron
were
friends
once
more
the
whole
thing
seemed
very
funny
again
Professor
Trelawney
who
had
been
pleased
with
the
pair
them
when
they
had
been
predicting
their
own
horrific
deaths
quickly
became
irritated
they
sniggered
through
her
explanation
the
various
ways
which
Pluto
could
disrupt
everyday
life
would
think
she
said
mystical
whisper
that
did
not
conceal
her
obvious
annoyance
that
some
she
stared
very
meaningfully
Harry
might
little
less
frivolous
had
they
seen
what
have
seen
during
crystal
gazing
last
night
sat
here
absorbed
needlework
the
urge
consult
the
orb
overpowered
arose
settled
myself
before
and
gazed
into
its
crystalline
depths
and
what
you
think
saw
gazing
back
ugly
old
bat
outsize
specs
Ron
muttered
under
his
breath
Harry
fought
hard
keep
his
face
straight
Death
dears
Parvati
and
Lavender
both
put
their
hands
over
their
mouths
looking
horrified
Yes
said
Professor
Trelawney
nodding
impressively
comes
ever
closer
circles
overhead
like
vulture
ever
lower
ever
lower
over
the
castle
She
stared
pointedly
Harry
who
yawned
very
widely
and
obviously
bit
more
impressive
she
hadn
done
about
eighty
times
before
Harry
said
they
finally
regained
the
fresh
air
the
staircase
beneath
Professor
Trelawney
room
But
dropped
dead
every
time
she
told
going
medical
miracle
You
sort
extra
concentrated
ghost
said
Ron
chortling
they
passed
the
Bloody
Baron
going
the
opposite
direction
his
wide
eyes
staring
sinisterly
least
didn
get
homework
hope
Hermione
got
loads
off
Professor
Vector
love
not
working
when
she
But
Hermione
wasn
dinner
nor
was
she
the
library
when
they
went
look
for
her
afterward
The
only
person
there
was
Viktor
Krum
Ron
hovered
behind
the
bookshelves
for
while
watching
Krum
debating
whispers
with
Harry
whether
should
ask
for
autograph
but
then
Ron
realized
that
six
seven
girls
were
lurking
the
next
row
books
debating
exactly
the
same
thing
and
lost
his
enthusiasm
for
the
idea
Wonder
where
she
got
Ron
said
and
Harry
went
back
Gryffindor
Tower
Dunno
balderdash
But
the
Fat
Lady
had
barely
begun
swing
forward
when
the
sound
racing
feet
behind
them
announced
Hermione
arrival
Harry
she
panted
skidding
halt
beside
him
the
Fat
Lady
stared
down
her
eyebrows
raised
Harry
you
got
come
you
got
come
the
most
amazing
thing
happened
please
She
seized
Harry
arm
and
started
try
drag
him
back
along
the
corridor
What
the
matter
Harry
said
show
you
when
get
there
come
quick
Harry
looked
around
Ron
looked
back
Harry
intrigued
Okay
Harry
said
starting
off
back
down
the
corridor
with
Hermione
Ron
hurrying
keep
don
mind
the
Fat
Lady
called
irritably
after
them
Don
apologize
for
bothering
just
hang
here
wide
open
until
you
get
back
shall
Yeah
thanks
Ron
shouted
over
his
shoulder
Hermione
where
are
going
Harry
asked
after
she
had
led
them
down
through
six
floors
and
started
down
the
marble
staircase
into
the
entrance
hall
You
see
you
see
minute
said
Hermione
excitedly
She
turned
left
the
bottom
the
staircase
and
hurried
toward
the
door
through
which
Cedric
Diggory
had
gone
the
night
after
the
Goblet
Fire
had
regurgitated
his
and
Harry
names
Harry
had
never
been
through
here
before
and
Ron
followed
Hermione
down
flight
stone
steps
but
instead
ending
gloomy
underground
passage
like
the
one
that
led
Snape
dungeon
they
found
themselves
broad
stone
corridor
brightly
lit
with
torches
and
decorated
with
cheerful
paintings
that
were
mainly
food
hang
said
Harry
slowly
halfway
down
the
corridor
Wait
minute
Hermione
What
She
turned
around
look
him
anticipation
all
over
her
face

what
this
about
said
Harry
nudged
Ron
and
pointed
the
painting
just
behind
Hermione
showed
gigantic
silver
fruit
bowl
Hermione
said
Ron
cottoning
You

rope
into
that
spew
stuff

she
said
hastily
And
not
spew
Ron
Changed

said
Ron
frowning
her
What
are
now
then
the
House
Elf
Liberation
Front
not
barging
into
that
kitchen
and
trying
make
them
stop
work
not
doing
not
asking
you
Hermione
said
impatiently
came
down
here
just
now
talk
them
all
and
found
come
Harry
want
show
you
She
seized
his
arm
again
pulled
him
front
the
picture
the
giant
fruit
bowl
stretched
out
her
forefinger
and
tickled
the
huge
green
pear
began
squirm
chuckling
and
suddenly
turned
into
large
green
door
handle
Hermione
seized
pulled
the
door
open
and
pushed
Harry
hard
the
back
forcing
him
inside
had
one
brief
glimpse
enormous
high
ceilinged
room
large
the
Great
Hall
above
with
mounds
glittering
brass
pots
and
pans
heaped
around
the
stone
walls
and
great
brick
fireplace
the
other
end
when
something
small
hurtled
toward
him
from
the
middle
the
room
squealing
Harry
Potter
sir
Harry
Potter
Next
second
all
the
wind
had
been
knocked
out
him
the
squealing
elf
hit
him
hard
the
midriff
hugging
him
tightly
thought
his
ribs
would
break
Dobby
Harry
gasped
Dobby
sir
squealed
the
voice
from
somewhere
around
his
navel
Dobby
has
been
hoping
and
hoping
see
Harry
Potter
sir
and
Harry
Potter
has
come
see
him
sir
Dobby
let
and
stepped
back
few
paces
beaming
Harry
his
enormous
green
tennis
ball
shaped
eyes
brimming
with
tears
happiness
looked
almost
exactly
Harry
remembered
him
the
pencil
shaped
nose
the
batlike
ears
the
long
fingers
and
feet
all
except
the
clothes
which
were
very
different
When
Dobby
had
worked
for
the
Malfoys
had
always
worn
the
same
filthy
old
pillowcase
Now
however
was
wearing
the
strangest
assortment
garments
Harry
had
ever
seen
had
done
even
worse
job
dressing
himself
than
the
wizards
the
World
Cup
was
wearing
tea
cozy
for
hat
which
had
pinned
number
bright
badges
tie
patterned
with
horseshoes
over
bare
chest
pair
what
looked
like
children
soccer
shorts
and
odd
socks
One
these
Harry
saw
was
the
black
one
Harry
had
removed
from
his
own
foot
and
tricked
Malfoy
into
giving
Dobby
thereby
setting
Dobby
free
The
other
was
covered
pink
and
orange
stripes
Dobby
what
you
doing
here
Harry
said
amazement
Dobby
has
come
work
Hogwarts
sir
Dobby
squealed
excitedly
Professor
Dumbledore
gave
Dobby
and
Winky
jobs
sir
Winky
said
Harry
She
here
too
Yes
sir
yes
said
Dobby
and
seized
Harry
hand
and
pulled
him
off
into
the
kitchen
between
the
four
long
wooden
tables
that
stood
there
Each
these
tables
Harry
noticed
passed
them
was
positioned
exactly
beneath
the
four
House
tables
above
the
Great
Hall
the
moment
they
were
clear
food
dinner
having
finished
but
supposed
that
hour
ago
they
had
been
laden
with
dishes
that
were
then
sent
through
the
ceiling
their
counterparts
above
least
hundred
little
elves
were
standing
around
the
kitchen
beaming
bowing
and
curtsying
Dobby
led
Harry
past
them
They
were
all
wearing
the
same
uniform
tea
towel
stamped
with
the
Hogwarts
crest
and
tied
Winky
had
been
like
toga
Dobby
stopped
front
the
brick
fireplace
and
pointed
Winky
sir
said
Winky
was
sitting
stool
the
fire
Unlike
Dobby
she
had
obviously
not
foraged
for
clothes
She
was
wearing
neat
little
skirt
and
blouse
with
matching
blue
hat
which
had
holes
for
her
large
ears
However
while
every
one
Dobby
strange
collection
garments
was
clean
and
well
cared
for
that
looked
brand
new
Winky
was
plainly
not
taking
care
other
clothes
all
There
were
soup
stains
all
down
her
blouse
and
burn
her
skirt
Hello
Winky
said
Harry
Winky
lip
quivered
Then
she
burst
into
tears
which
spilled
out
her
great
brown
eyes
and
splashed
down
her
front
just
they
had
done
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
dear
said
Hermione
She
and
Ron
had
followed
Harry
and
Dobby
the
end
the
kitchen
Winky
don
cry
please
don
But
Winky
cried
harder
than
ever
Dobby
the
other
hand
beamed
Harry
Would
Harry
Potter
like
cup
tea
squeaked
loudly
over
Winky
sobs
yeah
okay
said
Harry
Instantly
about
six
house
elves
came
trotting
behind
him
bearing
large
silver
tray
laden
with
teapot
cups
for
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
milk
jug
and
large
plate
biscuits
Good
service
Ron
said
impressed
voice
Hermione
frowned
him
but
the
elves
all
looked
delighted
they
bowed
very
low
and
retreated
How
long
have
you
been
here
Dobby
Harry
asked
Dobby
handed
around
the
tea
Only
week
Harry
Potter
sir
said
Dobby
happily
Dobby
came
see
Professor
Dumbledore
sir
You
see
sir
very
difficult
for
house
elf
who
has
been
dismissed
get
new
position
sir
very
difficult
indeed
this
Winky
howled
even
harder
her
squashed
tomato
nose
dribbling
all
down
her
front
though
she
made
effort
stem
the
flow
Dobby
has
traveled
the
country
for
two
whole
years
sir
trying
find
work
Dobby
squeaked
But
Dobby
hasn
found
work
sir
because
Dobby
wants
paying
now
The
house
elves
all
around
the
kitchen
who
had
been
listening
and
watching
with
interest
all
looked
away
these
words
though
Dobby
had
said
something
rude
and
embarrassing
Hermione
however
said
Good
for
you
Dobby
Thank
you
miss
said
Dobby
grinning
toothily
her
But
most
wizards
doesn
want
house
elf
who
wants
paying
miss
That
not
the
point
house
elf
they
says
and
they
slammed
the
door
Dobby
face
Dobby
likes
work
but
wants
wear
clothes
and
wants
paid
Harry
Potter
Dobby
likes
being
free
The
Hogwarts
house
elves
had
now
started
edging
away
from
Dobby
though
were
carrying
something
contagious
Winky
however
remained
where
she
was
though
there
was
definite
increase
the
volume
other
crying
And
then
Harry
Potter
Dobby
goes
visit
Winky
and
finds
out
Winky
has
been
freed
too
sir
said
Dobby
delightedly
this
Winky
flung
herself
forward
off
her
stool
and
lay
face
down
the
flagged
stone
floor
beating
her
tiny
fists
upon
and
positively
screaming
with
misery
Hermione
hastily
dropped
down
her
knees
beside
her
and
tried
comfort
her
but
nothing
she
said
made
the
slightest
difference
Dobby
continued
with
his
story
shouting
shrilly
over
Winky
screeches
And
then
Dobby
had
the
idea
Harry
Potter
sir
Why
doesn
Dobby
and
Winky
find
work
together
Dobby
says
Where
there
enough
work
for
two
house
elves
says
Winky
And
Dobby
thinks
and
comes
him
sir
Hogwarts
Dobby
and
Winky
came
see
Professor
Dumbledore
sir
and
Professor
Dumbledore
took
Dobby
beamed
very
brightly
and
happy
tears
welled
his
eyes
again
And
Professor
Dumbledore
says

Dobby
sir
Dobby
wants
paying
And
Dobby
free
elf
sir
and
Dobby
gets
Galleon

and
one
day
off
month
That
not
very
much
Hermione
shouted
indignantly
from
the
floor
over
Winky
continued
screaming
and
fist
beating
Professor
Dumbledore
offered
Dobby
ten
Galleons
week
and
weekends
off
said
Dobby
suddenly
giving
little
shiver
though
the
prospect
much
leisure
and
riches
were
frightening
but
Dobby
beat
him
down
miss
Dobby
likes
freedom
miss
but
isn
wanting
too
much
miss
likes
work
better
And
how
much
Professor
Dumbledore
paying
you
Winky
Hermione
asked
kindly
she
had
thought
this
would
cheer
Winky
she
was
wildly
mistaken
Winky
did
stop
crying
but
when
she
sat
she
was
glaring
Hermione
through
her
massive
brown
eyes
her
whole
face
sopping
wet
and
suddenly
furious
Winky
disgraced
elf
but
Winky
not
yet
getting

she
squeaked
Winky
not

Hermione
blankly
But
Winky

But
these
words
Winky
clapped
her
hands
over
the
holes
her
hat
flattening
her
ears
that
she
couldn
hear
word
and
screeched
You

Crouch

Crouch

Winky
Winky

Harry
Potter
squeaked
Dobby
confidentially
Winky
forgets
she
not
bound
Crouch
anymore
she
allowed
speak
her
mind
now
but
she
won
Can

Harry
asked

said
Dobby
looking
suddenly
serious

Professor

told
Dobby

not
insist
upon

Professor
Dumbledore
said

Dobby

suddenly
nervous
and
beckoned
Harry
closer
Harry
bent
forward
Dobby
whispered
said

Dobby
gave
frightened

But
Dobby

and
shaking
his
head
that
his
ears
flapped
Dobby

and

But

Harry
asked
him
grinning
slightly
fearful
look
came
into
Dobby
immense
eyes
Dobby
Dobby
could
said
doubtfully
squared
his
small
shoulders
Dobby
could
tell
Harry
Potter
that
his
old
masters
were

bad
Dark
wizards
Dobby
stood
for
moment
quivering
all
over
horror
struck
his
own
daring
then
rushed
over
the
nearest
table
and
began
banging
his
head
very
hard
squealing
Bad

Dobby
Harry
seized
Dobby

back

tie
and
pulled

She
dissolved

sobbing
into
her
skirt
Poor

Winky

They
couldn
get
another
sensible
word

Winky
They
left

crying
and
finished
their
tea
while
Dobby
chatted
happily
about
his
life
free
elf
and
his
plans
for
his
wages
Dobby
going
buy

Harry
Potter
said
happily
pointing

Harry
and
Ron
loaded
their
pockets
with
cream

CHAPTER

THE
UNEXPECTED
TASK
Potter
Weasley
Will
you
pay
attention
Professor
McGonagall
irritated
voice
cracked
like
whip
through
the
Transfiguration
class
Thursday
and
Harry
and
Ron
both
jumped
and
looked
was
the
end
the
lesson
they
had
finished
their
work
the
guinea
fowl
they
had
been
changing
into
guinea
pigs

Neville

they
had
copied
down
their
homework
from
the
blackboard
Describe
with
examples
the
ways
which
Transforming
Spells
must
adapted
when
performing
Cross
Species
Switches
The
bell
was
due
ring
any
moment
and
Harry
and
Ron
who
had
been
having
sword
fight
with
couple
Fred
and
George
fake
wands
the
back
the
class
looked
Ron
holding
tin
parrot
and
Harry
rubber
haddock
Now
that
Potter
and
Weasley
have
been
kind
enough
act
their
age
said
Professor
McGonagall
with
angry
look
the
pair
them
the
head
Harry
haddock
drooped
and
fell
silently
the
floor
Ron
parrot

before

something
say
you
all
The
Yule
Ball
approaching
traditional
part

Triwizard

and
opportunity
for
socialize
with
our
foreign

Now
the

and
above
although
you
may
invite
younger

Lavender
Brown
let
out
shrill
giggle
Parvati
Patil
nudged
her
hard
the
ribs
her
face
working
furiously
she
too
fought
not
giggle
They
both
looked
around
Harry
Professor
McGonagall
ignored
them
which
Harry
thought
was
distinctly
unfair
she
had
just
told
off
him
and
Ron
Dress
robes

worn
Professor
McGonagall
continued
and
the
ball
will
start

Day
finishing

the
Great

Now
then
Professor
McGonagall
stared
deliberately
around
the
class
The
Yule
Ball

for
all
let
our
hair

she
said
disapproving
voice
Lavender
giggled
harder
than
ever
with
her
hand
pressed
hard
against
her
mouth
stifle
the
sound
Harry
could
see
what
was
funny
this
time
Professor
McGonagall
with
her
hair
tight
bun
looked
though
she
had
never
let
her
hair
down
any
sense
But
that
does
NOT
mean
Professor
McGonagall
went
that
will
relaxing
the
standards

expect
from
Hogwarts
students
will
most
seriously

Gryffindor

way
The
bell
rang
and
there
was
the
usual
scuffle
activity
everyone
packed
their
bags
and
swung
them
onto
their
shoulders
Professor
McGonagall
called
above
the
noise
Potter
word
you
please
Assuming
this
had
something
with
his
headless
rubber
haddock
Harry
proceeded
gloomily
the
teacher
desk
Professor
McGonagall
waited
until
the
rest
the
class
had
gone
and
then
said
Potter
the
champions
and
their
partners
What
partners
said
Harry
Profesor
McGonagall
looked
suspiciously
him
though
she
thought
was
trying
funny
Your
partners
for
the
Yule
Ball
Potter
she
said
coldly
Your
dance
partners
Harry
insides
seemed
curl
and
shrivel
Dance
partners
felt
himself
going
red
don
dance
said
quickly
yes
you
said
Professor
McGonagall
irritably
That
what
telling
you
Traditionally
the
champions
and
their
partners
open
the
ball
Harry
had
sudden
mental
image
himself
top
hat
and
tails
accompanied
girl
the
sort
frilly
dress
Aunt
Petunia
always
wore
Uncle
Vernon
work
parties
not
dancing
said
traditional
said
Professor
McGonagall
firmly
You
are
Hogwarts
champion
and
you
will
what
expected
you
representative
the
school
make
sure
you
get
yourself
partner
Potter
But
don
You
heard
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
very
final
sort
way
week
ago
Harry
would
have
said
finding
partner
for
dance
would
cinch
compared
taking
Hungarian
Horntail
But
now
that
had
done
the
latter
and
was
facing
the
prospect
asking
girl
the
ball
thought
rather
have
another
round
with
the
dragon
Harry
had
never
known
many
people
put
their
names
down
stay
Hogwarts
for
Christmas
always
did
course
because
the
alternative
was
usually
going
back
Privet
Drive
but
had
always
been
very
much
the
minority
before
now
This
year
however
everyone
the
fourth
year
and
above
seemed
staying
and
they
all
seemed
Harry
obsessed
with
the
coming
ball
least
all
the
girls
were
and
was
amazing
how
many
girls
Hogwarts
suddenly
seemed
hold
had
never
quite
noticed
that
before
Girls
giggling
and
whispering
the
corridors
girls
shrieking
with
laughter
boys
passed
them
girls
excitedly
comparing
notes
what
they
were
going
wear
Christmas
night
Why
they
have
move
packs
Harry
asked
Ron
dozen
girls
walked
past
them
sniggering
and
staring
Harry
How
you
supposed
get
one
their
own
ask
them
Lasso
one
Ron
suggested
Got
any
idea
who
you
going
try
Harry
didn
answer
knew
perfectly
well
whom
like
ask
but
working
the
nerve
was
something
else
Cho
was
year
older
than
was
she
was
very
pretty
she
was
very
good
Quidditch
player
and
she
was
also
very
popular
Ron
seemed
know
what
was
going
inside
Harry
head
Listen
you
not
going
have
any
trouble
You
champion
You
just
beaten
Hungarian
Horntail
bet
they
queuing
with
you
tribute
their
recently
repaired
friendship
Ron
had
kept
the
bitterness
his
voice
bare
minimum
Moreover
Harry
amazement
turned
out
quite
right
curly
haired
third
year
Hufflepuff
girl
whom
Harry
had
never
spoken
his
life
asked
him
the
ball
with
her
the
very
next
day
Harry
was
taken
aback
said
before
even
stopped
consider
the
matter
The
girl
walked
off
looking
rather
hurt
and
Harry
had
endure
Dean
Seamus
and
Ron
taunts
about
her
all
through
History
Magic
The
following
day
two
more
girls
asked
him
second
year
and
his
horror
fifth
year
who
looked
though
she
might
knock
him
out
refused
She
was
quite
good
looking
said
Ron
fairly
after
stopped
laughing
She
was
foot
taller
than
said
Harry
still
unnerved
Imagine
what
look
like
trying
dance
with
her
Hermione
words
about
Krum
kept
coming
back
him
They
only
like
him
because
famous
Harry
doubted
very
much
any
the
girls
who
had
asked
his
partner
far
would
have
wanted
the
ball
with
him
hadn
been
school
champion
Then
wondered
this
would
bother
him
Cho
asked
him
the
whole
Harry
had
admit
that
even
with
the
embarrassing
prospect
opening
the
ball
before
him
life
had
definitely
improved
since
had
got
through
the
first
task
wasn
attracting
nearly
much
unpleasantness
the
corridors
anymore
which
suspected
had
lot
with
Cedric
had
idea
Cedric
might
have
told
the
Hufflepuffs
leave
Harry
alone
gratitude
for
Harry
tip
off
about
the
dragons
There
seemed
fewer
Support
Cedric
Diggory
badges
around
too
Draco
Malfoy
course
was
still
quoting
Rita
Skeeter
article
him
every
possible
opportunity
but
was
getting
fewer
and
fewer
laughs
out
and
just
heighten
Harry
feeling
well
being
story
about
Hagrid
had
appeared
the
Daily
Prophet
She
didn
seem
very
int
rested
magical
creatures
ter
tell
yeh
the
truth
Hagrid
said
when
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
asked
him
how
his
interview
with
Rita
Skeeter
had
gone
during
the
last
Care
Magical
Creatures
lesson
the
term
their
very
great
relief
Hagrid
had
given
direct
contact
with
the
skrewts
now
and
they
were
merely
sheltering
behind
his
cabin
today
sitting
trestle
table
and
preparing
fresh
selection
food
with
which
tempt
the
skrewts
She
jus
wanted
ter
talk
about
you
Harry
Hagrid
continued
low
voice
Well
told
her
been
friends
since
went
ter
fetch
yeh
from
the
Dursleys
Never
had
tell
him
off
four
years
she
said
Never
played
you
lessons
has
told
her
she
didn
seem
happy
all
Yeh
think
she
wanted
say
yeh
were
horrible
Harry
Course
she
did
said
Harry
throwing
lumps
dragon
liver
into
large
metal
bowl
and
picking
his
knife
cut
some
more
She
can
keep
writing
about
what
tragic
little
hero
get
boring
She
wants
new
angle
Hagrid
said
Ron
wisely
shelled
salamander
eggs
You
were
supposed
say
Harry
mad
delinquent
But
not
said
Hagrid
looking
genuinely
shocked
She
should
interviewed
Snape
said
Harry
grimly
give
her
the
goods
any
day
Potter
has
been
crossing
lines
ever
since
first
arrived
this
school
Said
that
did
said
Hagrid
while
Ron
and
Hermione
laughed
Well
yeh
might
bent
few
rules
Harry
yeh
all
righ
really
aren
you
Cheers
Hagrid
said
Harry
grinning
You
coming
this
ball
thing
Christmas
Day
Hagrid
said
Ron
Though
might
look
yeah
said
Hagrid
gruffly
Should
good
reckon
You
openin
the
dancin
won
yeh
Harry
Who
you
takin
one
yet
said
Harry
feeling
himself
going
red
again
Hagrid
didn
pursue
the
subject
The
last
week
term
became
increasingly
boisterous
progressed
Rumors
about
the
Yule
Ball
were
flying
everywhere
though
Harry
didn
believe
half
them
for
instance
that
Dumbledore
had
bought
eight
hundred
barrels
mulled
mead
from
Madam
Rosmerta
seemed
fact
however
that
had
booked
the
Weird
Sisters
Exactly
who
what
the
Weird
Sisters
were
Harry
didn
know
never
having
had
access
wizard
wireless
but
deduced
from
the
wild
excitement
those
who
had
grown
listening
the
WWN
Wizarding
Wireless
Network
that
they
were
very
famous
musical
group
Some
the
teachers
like
little
Professor
Flitwick
gave
trying
teach
them
much
when
their
minds
were
clearly
elsewhere
allowed
them
play
games
his
lesson
Wednesday
and
spent
most
talking
Harry
about
the
perfect
Summoning
Charm
Harry
had
used
during
the
first
task
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Other
teachers
were
not
generous
Nothing
would
ever
deflect
Professor
Binns
for
example
from
plowing
through
his
notes
goblin
rebellions
Binns
hadn
let
his
own
death
stand
the
way
continuing
teach
they
supposed
small
thing
like
Christmas
wasn
going
put
him
off
was
amazing
how
could
make
even
bloody
and
vicious
goblin
riots
sound
boring
Percys
cauldron
bottom
report
Professors
McGonagall
and
Moody
kept
them
working
until
the
very
last
second
their
classes
too
and
Snape
course
would
sooner
let
them
play
games
class
than
adopt
Harry
Staring
nastily
around
them
all
informed
them
that
would
testing
them
poison
antidotes
during
the
last
lesson
the
term
Evil
Ron
said
bitterly
that
night
the
Gryffindor
common
room
Springing
test
the
last
day
Ruining
the
last
bit
term
with
whole
load
studying
Mmm
you
not
exactly
straining
yourself
though
are
you
said
Hermione
looking
him
over
the
top
her
Potions
notes
Ron
was
busy
building
card
castle
out
his
Exploding
Snap
pack
much
more
interesting
pastime
than
with
Muggle
cards
because
the
chance
that
the
whole
thing
would
blow
any
second
Christmas
Hermione
said
Harry
lazily
was
rereading
Flying
with
the
Cannons
for
the
tenth
time
armchair
near
the
fire
Hermione
looked
severely
over
him
too
have
thought
you
doing
something
constructive
Harry
even
you
don
want
learn
your
antidotes
Like
what
Harry
said
watched
Joey
Jenkins
the
Cannons
belt
Bludger
toward
Ballycastle
Bats
Chaser
That
egg
Hermione
hissed
Come
Hermione
got
till
February
the
twenty
fourth
Harry
said
had
put
the
golden
egg
upstairs
his
trunk
and
hadn
opened
since
the
celebration
party
after
the
first
task
There
were
still
two
and
half
months
until
needed
know
what
all
the
screechy
wailing
meant
after
all
But
might
take
weeks
work
out
said
Hermione
You
going
look
real
idiot
everyone
else
knows
what
the
next
task
and
you
don
Leave
him
alone
Hermione
earned
bit
break
said
Ron
and
placed
the
last
two
cards
top
the
castle
and
the
whole
lot
blew
singeing
his
eyebrows
Nice
look
Ron
well
with
your
dress
robes
that
will
was
Fred
and
George
They
sat
down
the
table
with
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
Ron
felt
how
much
damage
had
been
done
Ron
can
borrow
Pigwidgeon
George
asked
off
delivering
letter
said
Ron
Why
Because
George
wants

ball
said
Fred
sarcastically
Because

said
George
Who

Ron
Nose

Fred
waving
his
wand
threateningly

Ron
Well

said
Fred
Who

said
Ron
Angelina
said
Fred
promptly
without
trace
embarrassment
What
said
Ron
taken
aback
You
already
asked
her
Good
point
said
Fred
turned
his
head
and
called
across
the
common
room
Angelina
Angelina
who
had
been
chatting
with
Alicia
Spinnet
near
the
fire
looked
over
him
What
she
called
back
Want
come
the
ball
with
Angelina
gave
Fred
appraising
sort
look
All
right
then
she
said
and
she
turned
back
Alicia
and
carried
chatting
with
bit
grin
her
face
There
you
said
Fred
Harry
and
Ron
piece
cake
got
his
feet
yawning
and
said
better
use
school
owl
then
George
come
They
left
Ron
stopped
feeling
his
eyebrows
and
looked
across
the
smoldering
wreck
his
card
castle
Harry
should
get
move
you
know
ask
someone
right
don
want
end
with
pair
trolls
Hermione
let
out
sputter
indignation
pair
what
excuse
Well
you
know
said
Ron
shrugging
rather
alone
than
with
with
Eloise
Midgen
say
Her
acne
loads
better
lately
and
she
really
nice
Her
nose
off
center
said
Ron
see
Hermione
said
bristling
basically
you
going
take
the
best
looking
girl
who
have
you
even
she
completely
horrible
yeah
that
sounds
about
right
said
Ron
going
bed
Hermione
snapped
and
she
swept
off
toward
the
girls
staircase
without
another
word
The
Hogwarts
staff
demonstrating
continued
desire
impress
the
visitors
from
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
seemed
determined
show
the
castle
its
best
this
Christmas
When
the
decorations
went
Harry
noticed
that
they
were
the
most
stunning
had
yet
seen
inside
the
school
Everlasting
icicles
had
been
attached
the
banisters
the
marble
staircase
the
usual
twelve
Christmas
trees
the
Great
Hall
were
bedecked
with
everything
from
luminous
holly
berries
real
hooting
golden
owls
and
the
suits
armor
had
all
been
bewitched
sing
carols
whenever
anyone
passed
them
was
quite
something
hear
Come
All
Faithful
sung
empty
helmet
that
only
knew
half
the
words
Several
times
Filch
the
caretaker
had
extract
Peeves
from
inside
the
armor
where
had
taken
hiding
filling
the
gaps
the
songs
with
lyrics
his
own
invention
all
which
were
very
rude
And
still
Harry
hadn
asked
Cho
the
ball
and
Ron
were
getting
very
nervous
now
though
Harry
pointed
out
Ron
would
look
much
less
stupid
than
would
without
partner
Harry
was
supposed
starting
the
dancing
with
the
other
champions
suppose
there
always
Moaning
Myrtle
said
gloomily
referring
the
ghost
who
haunted
the
girls
toilets
the
second
floor
Harry
just
got
grit
our
teeth
and
said
Ron
Friday
morning
tone
that
suggested
they
were
planning
the
storming
impregnable
fortress
When
get
back
the
common
room
tonight
both
have
partners
agreed
okay
said
Harry
But
every
time
glimpsed
Cho
that
day
during
break
and
then
lunchtime
and
once
the
way
History
Magic
she
was
surrounded
friends
Didn
she
ever
anywhere
alone
Could
perhaps
ambush
her
she
was
going
into
bathroom
But
she
even
seemed
there
with
escort
four
five
girls
Yet
didn
soon
she
was
bound
have
been
asked
somebody
else
found
hard
concentrate
Snape
Potions
test
and
consequently
forgot
add
the
key
ingredient
bezoar
meaning
that
received
bottom
marks
didn
care
though
was
too
busy
screwing
his
courage
for
what
was
about
When
the
bell
rang
grabbed
his
bag
and
hurried
the
dungeon
door
meet
you
dinner
said
Ron
and
Hermione
and
dashed
off
upstairs
just
have
ask
Cho
for
private
word
that
was
all
hurried
off
through
the
packed
corridors
looking
for
her
and
rather
sooner
than
had
expected
found
her
emerging
from
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
Cho
Could
have
word
with
you
Giggling
should
made
illegal
Harry
thought
furiously
all
the
girls
around
Cho
started
doing
She
didn
though
She
said
Okay
and
followed
him
out
earshot
other
classmates
Harry
turned
look
her
and
his
stomach
gave
weird
lurch
though
had
missed
step
going
downstairs
said
couldn
ask
her
couldn
But
had
Cho
stood
there
looking
puzzled
watching
him
The
words
came
out
before
Harry
had
quite
got
his
tongue
around
them
Wangoballwime
Sorry
said
Cho
you
you
want
the
ball
with
said
Harry
Why
did
have
red
now
Why
aid
Cho
and
she
went
red
too
Harry
really
sorry
and
she
truly
looked
already
said
with
someone
else
said
Harry
was
odd
moment
before
his
insides
had
been
writhing
like
snakes
but
suddenly
didn
seem
have
any
insides
all
okay
said
problem
really
sorry
she
said
again
That
okay
said
Harry
They
stood
there
looking
each
other
and
then
Cho
said
Well
Yeah
said
Harry
Well
bye
said
Cho
still
very
red
She
walked
away
Harry
called
after
her
before
could
stop
himself
Who
you
going
with
Cedric
she
said
Cedric
Diggory
right
said
Harry
His
insides
had
come
back
again
felt
though
they
had
been
filled
with
lead
their
absence
Completely
forgetting
about
dinner
walked
slowly
back
Gryffindor
Tower
Cho
voice
echoing
his
ears
with
every
step
took
Cedric
Cedric
Diggory
had
been
starting
quite
like
Cedric
prepared
overlook
the
fact
that
had
once
beaten
him
Quidditch
and
was
handsome
and
popular
and
nearly
everyone
favorite
champion
Now
suddenly
realized
that
Cedric
was
fact
useless
pretty
boy
who
didn
have
enough
brains
fill
eggcup
Fairy
lights
said
dully
the
Fat
Lady
the
password
had
been
changed
the
previous
day
Yes
indeed
dear
she
trilled
straightening
her
new
tinsel
hair
band
she
swung
forward
admit
him
Entering
the
common
room
Harry
looked
around
and
his
surprise
saw
Ron
sitting
ashen
faced
distant
corner
Ginny
was
sitting
with
him
talking
him
what
seemed
low
soothing
voice
What
Ron
said
Harry
joining
them
Ron
looked
Harry
sort
blind
horror
his
face
Why
did
said
wildly
don
know
what
made
What
said
Harry
just
asked
Fleur
Delacour
the
ball
with
him
said
Ginny
She
looked
though
she
was
fighting
back
smile
but
she
kept
patting
Ron
arm
sympathetically
You
what
said
Harry
don
know
what
made
Ron
gasped
again
What
was
playing
There
were
people
all
around
gone
mad
everyone
watching
was
just
walking
past
her
the
entrance
hall
she
was
standing
there
talking
Diggory
and
sort
came
over
and
asked
her
Ron
moaned
and
put
his
face
his
hands
kept
talking
though
the
words
were
barely
distinguishable
She
looked
like
was
sea
slug
something
Didn
even
answer
And
then
dunno
just
sort
came
senses
and
ran
for
She
part
veela
said
Harry
You
were
right
her
grandmother
was
one
wasn
your
fault
bet
you
just
walked
past
when
she
was
turning
the
old
charm
for
Diggory
and
got
blast
but
she
was
wasting
her
time
going
with
Cho
Chang
Ron
looked
asked
her
with
just
now
Harry
said
dully
and
she
told

she
Well

dangerously
Just

Then

Hermione
said

And

stormed
off
toward

dormitories
again
She

Ron
flatly
watching

She

Ginny
quietly

she
went
scarlet
too
going

thought
well
not

She
looked
extremely
miserable

and
have

she
said
and
she
got
and
walked
off
the
portrait
hole
her
head
bowed
Ron
goggled
Harry
What
got
into
them
demanded
But
Harry
had
just
seen
Parvati
and
Lavender
come
through
the
portrait
hole
The
time
had
come
for
drastic
action
Wait

said
Ron
and
stood
walked
straight
Parvati
and
said
Parvati
Will

with
Parvati
went
into
fit
giggles
Harry
waited
for
them
subside
his
fingers
crossed
the
pocket
his
robes

she
said
finally
blushing
furiously

Harry
relief

Ron
She
going

Seamus
said
Parvati
and
the
pair
them
giggled
harder
than
ever
Harry
sighed
Can

think
anyone
who

Ron
said
lowering
his
voice
that
Ron
wouldn
hear
What

Hermione
Granger
said
Parvati
She
going
with
someone
else
Parvati
looked
astonished
Ooooh

Harry
shrugged

Well

Parvati
slowly

Padma

Ravenclaw
ask
her
you

great
said
Harry
Let

you
And
went
back
over
Ron
feeling
that
this
ball
was
lot
more
trouble
than
was
worth
and
hoping
very
much
that
Padma
Patil
nose
was
dead

CHAPTER
TWENTY
THREE
THE
YULE
BALL
Despite
the
very
heavy
load
homework
that
the
fourth
years
had
been
given
for
the
holidays
Harry
was
mood
work
when
term
ended
and
spent
the
week
leading
Christmas
enjoying
himself
fully
possible
along
with
everyone
else
Gryffindor
Tower
was
hardly
less
crowded
now
than
during
term
time
seemed
have
shrunk
slightly
too
its
inhabitants
were
being
much
rowdier
than
usual
Fred
and
George
had
had
great
success
with
their
Canary
Creams
and
for
the
first
couple
days
the
holidays
people
kept
bursting
into
feather
all
over
the
place
Before
long
however
all
the
Gryffindors
had
learned
treat
food
anybody
else
offered
them
with
extreme
caution
case
had
Canary
Cream
concealed
the
center
and
George
confided
Harry
that
and
Fred
were
now
working
developing
something
else
Harry
made
mental
note
never
accept
much
crisp
from
Fred
and
George
future
still
hadn
forgotten
Dudley
and
the
Ton
Tongue
Toffee
Snow
was
falling
thickly
upon
the
castle
and
its
grounds
now
The
pale
blue
Beauxbatons
carriage
looked
like
large
chilly
frosted
pumpkin
next
the
iced
gingerbread
house
that
was
Hagrid
cabin
while
the
Durmstrang
ship
portholes
were
glazed
with
ice
the
rigging
white
with
frost
The
house
elves
down
the
kitchen
were
outdoing
themselves
with
series
rich
warming
stews
and
savory
puddings
and
only
Fleur
Delacour
seemed
able
find
anything
complain
about
too
eavy
all
zis
Ogwarts
food
they
heard
her
saying
grumpily
they
left
the
Great
Hall
behind
her
one
evening
Ron
skulking
behind
Harry
keen
not
spotted
Fleur
will
not
fit
into
dress
robes
Oooh
there
tragedy
Hermione
snapped
Fleur
went
out
into
the
entrance
hall
She
really
thinks
lot
herself
that
one
doesn
she
Hermione
who
are
you
going
the
ball
with
said
Ron
kept
springing
this
question
her
hoping
startle
her
into
response
asking
when
she
least
expected
However
Hermione
merely
frowned
and
said
not
telling
you
you
just
make
fun
You
joking
Weasley
said
Malfoy
behind
them
You
not
telling
someone
asked
that
the
ball
Not
the
long
molared
Mudblood
Harry
and
Ron
both
whipped
around
but
Hermione
said
loudly
waving
somebody
over
Malfoys
shoulder
Hello
Professor
Moody
Malfoy
went
pale
and
jumped
backward
looking
wildly
around
for
Moody
but
was
still
the
staff
table
finishing
his
stew
Twitchy
little
ferret
aren

Malfoy
said
Hermione
scathingly
and
she
Harry
and
Ron
went
the
marble
staircase
laughing
heartily
Hermione
said
Ron
looking
sideways
her
suddenly
frowning
your
teeth
What
about
them
she
said
Well

noticed

you
expect

They
all
straight
and
and
normal
sized
Hermione
suddenly
smiled
very
mischievously
and
Harry
noticed
too
was
very
different
smile
from
the
one
remembered
Well
when
went
Madam
Pomfrey
get
them
shrunk
she
held
mirror
and
told
stop
her
when
they
were
back
how
they
normally
were
she
said
And
just
let
her
carry
bit
She
smiled
even
more
widely
Mum
and
Dad

too
pleased

trying
persuade
them

for

but
they

You

Pigwidgeons
back
Ron
tiny
owl
was
twittering
madly
the
top
the
icicle
laden
banisters
scroll
parchment
tied
his
leg
People
passing
him
were
pointing
and
laughing
and
group
third
year
girls
paused
and
said

weeny

Ron
hissed
hurrying
the
stairs
and
snatching
Pigwidgeon
You

around
showing
off
Pigwidgeon
hooted
happily
his
head
protruding
over
Ron
fist
The
third
year
girls
all
looked
very
shocked
Clear

Ron
snapped
them
waving
the
fist
holding
Pigwidgeon
who
hooted
more
happily
than
ever
soared
through
the
air
Here

Harry
Ron
added
undertone
the
third
year
girls
scuttled
away
looking
scandalized
pulled
Sirius
reply
off
Pigwidgeons
leg
Harry
pocketed
and
they
hurried
back
Gryffindor
Tower
read
Everyone
the
common
room
was
much
too
busy
letting
off
more
holiday
steam
observe
what
anyone
else
was
Ron
Harry
and
Hermione
sat
apart
from
everyone
else
dark
window
that
was
gradually
filling
with
snow
and
Harry
read
out
Dear
Harry
Congratulations
getting
past
the
Horntail
Whoever
put
your
name
that
goblet
shouldn
feeling
too
happy
right
now
was
going

Conjunctivitus
Curse
dragon
eyes
are
its
weakest
point
That
what
Krum
did
Hermione
whispered
but
your
way
was
better
impressed
Don
get
complacent
though
Harry
You
only
done
one
task
whoever
put
you
for
the
tournament
got
plenty
more
opportunity
they
trying
hurt
you
Keep
your
eyes
open
particularly
when
the
person
discussed
around
and
concentrate
keeping
yourself
out
trouble
Keep
touch
still
want
hear
about
anything
unusual
Sirius
sounds
exactly
like
Moody
said
Harry
quietly
tucking
the
letter
away
again
inside
his
robes
Constant
vigilance
You
think
walk
around
with
eyes
shut
banging
off
the
walls
But
right
Harry
said
Hermione
you
have
still
got
two
tasks
You
really
ought
have
look
that
egg
you
know
and
start
working
out
what
means
Hermione
got
ages
snapped
Ron
Want
game
chess
Harry
Yeah

said
Harry
Then
spotting
the
look
Hermione
face
said
Come
how
supposed
concentrate
with
all
this
noise
going
won
even
able
hear
the
egg
over
this
lot
suppose
not
she
sighed
and
she
sat
down
watch
their
chess
match
which
culminated
exciting
checkmate
Ron
involving
couple
recklessly
brave
pawns
and
very
violent
bishop
Harry
awoke
very
suddenly
Christmas
Day
Wondering
what
had
caused
his
abrupt
return
consciousness
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
something
with
very
large
round
green
eyes
staring
back
him
the
darkness
close
they
were
almost
nose
nose
Dobby
Harry
yelled
scrambling
away
from
the
elf
fast
almost
fell
out
bed
Don
that
Dobby
sorry
sir
squeaked
Dobby
anxiously
jumping
backward
with
his
long
fingers
over
his
mouth
Dobby
only
wanting
wish
Harry
Potter
Merry
Christmas
and
bring
him
present
Sir
Harry
Potter
did
say
Dobby
could
come
and
see
him
sometimes
sir
okay
said
Harry
still
breathing
rather
faster
than
usual
while
his
heart
rate
returned
normal
Just
just
prod
something
future
all
right
don
bend
over
like
that
Harry
pulled
back
the
curtains
around
his
four
poster
took
his
glasses
from
his
bedside
table
and
put
them
His
yell
had
awoken
Ron
Seamus
Dean
and
Neville
All
them
were
peering
through
the
gaps
their
own
hangings
heavy
eyed
and
tousle
haired
Someone
attacking
you
Harry
Seamus
asked
sleepily
just
Dobby
Harry
muttered
back
sleep
Nah
presents
said
Seamus
spotting
the
large
pile
the
foot
his
bed
Ron
Dean
and
Neville
decided
that
now
they
were
awake
they
might
well
get
down
some
present
opening
too
Harry
turned
back
Dobby
who
was
now
standing
nervously
next
Harrys
bed
still
looking
worried
that
had
upset
Harry
There
was
Christmas
bauble
tied
the
loop
top
his
tea
cozy
Can
Dobby
give
Harry
Potter
his
present
squeaked
tentatively
Course

can
said
Harry
got
something
for
you
too
was
lie
hadn
bought
anything
for
Dobby
all
but
quickly
opened
his
trunk
and
pulled
out
particularly
knobbly
rolled
pair
socks
They
were
his
oldest
and
foulest
mustard
yellow
and
had
once
belonged
Uncle
Vernon
The
reason
they
were
extra
knobbly
was
that
Harry
had
been
using
them
cushion
his
Sneakoscope
for
over
year
now
pulled
out
the
Sneako
scope
and
handed
the
socks
Dobby
saying
Sorry
forgot
wrap
them
But
Dobby
was
utterly
delighted
Socks

Dobby
favorite
favorite
clothes
sir
said
ripping
off
his
odd
ones
and
pulling
Uncle
Vernon
has
seven
now
sir
But
sir
said
his
eyes
widening
having
pulled
both
socks
their
highest
extent
that
they
reached
the
bottom
his
shorts
they
has
made
mistake
the
shop
Harry
Potter
they
giving
you
two
the
same
Harry
how
come
you
didn
spot

said
Ron
grinning
over
from
his
own
bed
which
was
now
strewn
with
wrapping
paper
Tell
you
what
Dobby
here
you
take
these
two
and
you
can
mix
them
properly
And
here
your
sweater

Dobby
pair
violet
socks

just
unwrapped
and
the
hand
knitted
sweater
Mrs
Weasley
had
sent
Dobby
looked
quite
overwhelmed
Sir
very
kind
squeaked
his
eyes
brimming
with
tears
again
bowing
deeply
Ron
Dobby
knew
sir
must
great
wizard
for
Harry
Potter
greatest
friend
but
Dobby
did
not
know
that
was
also
generous
spirit
noble
selfless
They

said
Ron
who
had
gone
slightly
pink
around
the
ears
though
looked
rather
pleased
all
the
same
Wow
Harry
had
just
opened
Harry
present
Chudley
Cannon
hat
Cool
jammed
onto
his
head
where
clashed
horribly
with
his
hair
Dobby
now
handed
Harry
small
package
which
turned
out
socks
Dobby
making
them
himself
sir
the
elf
said
happily
buying
the
wool
out

The
left

red
and
had
pattern
broomsticks
upon
the
right
sock

green

Snitches

Dobby
said
Harry
and
pulled
them
causing
Dobby
eyes
leak
with
happiness
again
Dobby
must
now
sir
already
making
Christmas
dinner
the
kitchens
said
Dobby
and
hurried
out
the
dormitory
waving
good
bye
Ron
and
the
others
passed
Harry
other
presents
were
much
more
satisfactory
than
Dobby
odd
socks
with
the
obvious
exception
the
Dursleys
which
consisted

all
time
low
Harry
supposed

Harry
supposed

her
all
about

Horntail
and
large
quantity
homemade
mince
pies
Harry
and
Ron
met
with
Hermione
the
common
room
and
they
went
down
breakfast
together
They
spent
most
the
morning
Gryffindor
Tower
where
everyone
was
enjoying
their
presents
then
returned
the
Great
Hall
for
magnificent
lunch
which
included
least
hundred
turkeys
and
Christmas
puddings
and
large
piles
Cribbage
Wizarding
Crackers
They
went
out
onto
the
grounds
the
afternoon
the
snow
was
untouched
except
for
the
deep
channels
made
the
Durmstrang
and
Beauxbatons
students
their
way
the
castle
Hermione
chose
watch
Harry
and
the
Weasleys
snowball
fight
rather
than
join
and
five
clock
said
she
was
going
back
upstairs
get
ready
for
the
ball
What
you
need
three
hours
said
Ron
looking
her
incredulously
and
paying
for
his
lapse
concentration
when
large
snowball
thrown
George
hit
him
hard
the
side
the
head
Who
you
going
with
yelled
after
Hermione
but
she
just
waved
and
disappeared
the
stone
steps
into
the
castle
There
was
Christmas
tea
today
the
ball
included
feast
seven
clock
when
had
become
hard
aim
properly
the
others
abandoned
their
snowball
fight
and
trooped
back
the
common
room
The
Fat
Lady
was
sitting
her
frame
with
her
friend
Violet
from
downstairs
both
them
extremely
tipsy
empty
boxes
chocolate
liqueurs
littering
the
bottom

Lairy
fights
that
the
one
she
giggled
when
they
gave
the
password
and
she
swung
forward
let
them
inside
Harry
Ron
Seamus
Dean
and
Neville
changed
into
their
dress
robes
their
dormitory
all
them
looking
very
self
conscious
but
none
much
Ron
who
surveyed
himself
the
long
mirror
the
corner
with
appalled
look
his
face
There
was
just
getting
around
the
fact
that
his
robes
looked
more
like
dress
than
anything
else
desperate
attempt
make
them
look
more
manly
used
Severing
Charm
the
ruff
and
cuffs
worked
fairly
well
least
was
now
lace
free
although
hadn
done
very
neat
job
and
the
edges
still
looked
depressingly
frayed
the
boys
set
off
downstairs
still
can
work
out
how
you
two
got
the
best
looking
girls
the
year
muttered
Dean
Animal
magnetism
said
Ron
gloomily
pulling
stray
threads
out
his
cuffs
The
common
room
looked
strange
full
people
wearing
different
colors
instead
the
usual
mass
black
Parvati
was
waiting
for
Harry
the
foot
the
stairs
She
looked
very
pretty
indeed
robes
shocking
pink
with
her
long
dark
plait
braided
with
gold
and
gold
bracelets
glimmering
her
wrists
Harry
was
relieved
see
that
she
wasn
giggling
You
look
nice
said
awkwardly
Thanks
she
said
Padma
going
meet
you
the
entrance
hall
she
added
Ron
Right
said
Ron
looking
around
Where
Hermione
Parvati
shrugged
Shall

then
Harry
Okay
said
Harry
wishing
could
just
stay
the
common
room
Fred
winked
Harry
passed
him
the
way
out
the
portrait
hole
The
entrance
hall
was
packed
with
students
too
all
milling
around
waiting
for
eight
clock
when
the
doors
the
Great
Hall
would
thrown
open
Those
people
who
were
meeting
partners
from
different
Houses
were
edging
through
the
crowd
trying
find
one
another
Parvati
found
her
sister
Padma
and
led
her
over
Harry
and
Ron
said
Padma
who
was
looking
just
pretty
Parvati
robes
bright
turquoise
She
didn
look
too
enthusiastic
about
having
Ron
partner
though
her
dark
eyes
lingered
the
frayed
neck
and
sleeves
his
dress
robes
she
looked
him
and
down
said
Ron
not
looking
her
but
staring
around
the
crowd
bent
his
knees
slightly
hide
behind
Harry
because
Fleur
Delacour
was
passing
looking
stunning
robes
silver
gray
satin
and
accompanied
the
Ravenclaw
Quidditch
captain
Roger
Davies
When
they
had
disappeared
Ron
stood
straight
again
and
stared
over
the
heads
the
crowd
Where
Hermione
said
again
group
Slytherins
came
the
steps
from
their
dungeon
common
room
Malfoy
was
front
was
wearing
dress
robes
black
velvet
with
high
collar
which
Harry
opinion
made
him
look
like
vicar
Pansy
Parkinson
very
frilly
robes
pale
pink
was
clutching
Malfoy
arm
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
both
wearing
green
they
resembled
moss
colored
boulders
and
neither
them
Harry
was
pleased
see
had
managed
find
partner
The
oak
front
doors
opened
and
everyone
turned
look
the
Durmstrang
students
entered
with
Professor
Karkaroff
Krum
was
the
front
the
party
accompanied
pretty
girl
blue
robes
Harry
didn
know
Over
their
heads
saw
that
area
lawn
right
front
the
castle
had
been
transformed
into
sort
grotto
full
fairy
lights
meaning
hundreds
actual
living
fairies
were
sitting
the
rosebushes
that
had
been
conjured
there
and
fluttering
over
the
statues
what
seemed
Father
Christmas
and
his
reindeer
Then
Professor
McGonagall
voice
called
Champions
over
here
please
Parvati
readjusted
her
bangles
beaming
she
and
Harry
said
See
you
minute
Ron
and
Padma
and
walked
forward
the
chattering
crowd
parting
let
them
through
Professor
McGonagall
who
was
wearing
dress
robes
red
tartan
and
had
arranged
rather
ugly
wreath
thistles
around
the
brim
other
hat
told
them
wait
one
side
the
doors
while
everyone
else
went
inside
they
were
enter
the
Great
Hall
procession
when
the
rest
the
students
had
sat
down
Fleur
Delacour
and
Roger
Davies
stationed
themselves
nearest
the
doors
Davies
looked
stunned
his
good
fortune
having
Fleur
for
partner
that
could
hardly
take
his
eyes
off
her
Cedric
and
Cho
were
close
Harry
too
looked
away
from
them
wouldn
have
talk
them
His
eyes
fell
instead
the
girl
next
Krum
His
jaw
dropped
was
Hermione
But
she
didn
look
like
Hermione
all
She
had
done
something
with
her
hair
was
longer
bushy
but
sleek
and
shiny
and
twisted
into
elegant
knot
the
back
her
head
She
was
wearing
robes
made
floaty
periwinkle
blue
material
and
she
was
holding
herself
differently
somehow
maybe
was
merely
the
absence
the
twenty
books
she
usually
had
slung
over
her
back
She
was
also
smiling
rather
nervously
was
true
but
the
reduction
the
size
her
front
teeth
was
more
noticeable
than
ever
Harry
couldn
understand
how
hadn
spotted
before
Harry
she
said
Parvati
Parvati
was
gazing
Hermione
unflattering
disbelief
She
wasn
the
only
one
either
when
the
doors
the
Great
Hall
opened
Krum
fan
club
from
the
library
stalked
past
throwing
Hermione
looks
deepest
loathing
Pansy
Parkinson
gaped
her
she
walked
with
Malfoy
and
even
didn
seem
able
find
insult
throw
her
Ron
however
walked
right
past
Hermione
without
looking
her
Once
everyone
else
was
settled
the
Hall
Professor
McGonagall
told
the
champions
and
their
partners
get
line
pairs
and
follow
her
They
did
and
everyone
the
Great
Hall
applauded
they
entered
and
started
walking
toward
large
round
table
the
top
the
Hall
where
the
judges
were
sitting
The
walls
the
Hall
had
all
been
covered
sparkling
silver
frost
with
hundreds
garlands
mistletoe
and
ivy
crossing
the
starry
black
ceiling
The
House
tables
had
vanished
instead
there
were
about
hundred
smaller
lantern
lit
ones
each
seating
about
dozen
people
Harry
concentrated
not
tripping
over
his
feet
Parvati
seemed
enjoying
herself
she
was
beaming
around
everybody
steering
Harry
forcefully
that
felt
though
were
show
dog
she
was
putting
through
its
paces
caught
sight
Ron
and
Padma
neared
the
top
table
Ron
was
watching
Hermione
pass
with
narrowed
eyes
Padma
was
looking
sulky
Dumbledore
smiled
happily
the
champions
approached
the
top
table
but
Karkaroff
wore
expression
remarkably
like
Ron
watched
Krum
and
Hermione
draw
nearer
Ludo
Bagman
tonight
robes
bright
purple
with
large
yellow
stars
was
clapping
enthusiastically
any
the
students
and
Madame
Maxime
who
had
changed
her
usual
uniform
black
satin
for
flowing
gown
lavender
silk
was
applauding
them
politely
But
Crouch
Harry
suddenly
realized
was
not
there
The
fifth
seat
the
table
was
occupied
Percy
Weasley
When
the
champions
and
their
partners
reached
the
table
Percy
drew
out
the
empty
chair
beside
him
staring
pointedly
Harry
Harry
took
the
hint
and
sat
down
next
Percy
who
was
wearing
brand
new
navy
blue
dress
robes
and
expression
such
smugness
that
Harry
thought
ought
fined
been
promoted
Percy
said
before
Harry
could
even
ask
and
from
his
tone
might
have
been
announcing
his
election
supreme
ruler
the
universe
now
Crouch
personal
assistant
and
here
representing
him
Why
didn
come
Harry
asked
wasn
looking
forward
being
lectured
cauldron
bottoms
all
through
dinner
afraid
say
Crouch
isn
well
not
well
all
Hasn
been
right
since
the
World
Cup
Hardly
surprising
overwork
not
young
was
though
still
quite
brilliant
course
the
mind
remains
great
ever
was
But
the
World
Cup
was
fiasco
for
the
whole
Ministry
and
then
Crouch
suffered
huge
personal
shock
with
the
misbehavior
that
house
elf
his
Blinky
whatever
she
was
called
Naturally
dismissed
her
immediately
afterward
but
well
say
getting
needs
looking
after
and
think
found
definite
drop
his
home
comforts
since
she
left
And
then
had
the
tournament
arrange
and
the
aftermath
the
Cup
deal
with
that
revolting
Skeeter
woman
buzzing
around
poor
man
having
well
earned
quiet
Christmas
just
glad
knew
had
someone
could
rely
upon
take
his
place
Harry
wanted
very
much
ask
whether
Crouch
had
stopped
calling
Percy
Weatherby
yet
but
resisted
the
temptation
There
was
food
yet
the
glittering
golden
plates
but
small
menus
were
lying
front
each
them
Harry
picked
his
uncertainly
and
looked
around
there
were
waiters
Dumbledore
however
looked
carefully
down
his
own
menu
then
said
very
clearly
his
plate
Pork
chops
And
pork
chops
appeared
Getting
the
idea
the
rest
the
table
placed
their
orders
with
their
plates
too
Harry
glanced
Hermione
see
how
she
felt
about
this
new
and
more
complicated
method
dining
surely
meant
plenty
extra
work
for
the
house
elves
but
for
once
Hermione
didn
seem
thinking
about
She
was
deep
talk
with
Viktor
Krum
and
hardly
seemed
notice
what
she
was
eating
now
occurred
Harry
that
had
never
actually
heard
Krum
speak
before
but
was
certainly
talking
now
and
very
enthusiastically
that
Veil
have
castle
also
not
big
this
nor
comfortable
thinking
was
telling
Hermione
have
just
four
floors
and
the
fires
are
lit
only
for
magical
purposes
But
have
grounds
larger
even
than
these
though
vinter
have
very
little
daylight
are
not
enjoying
them
But
summer
are
flying
every
day
over
the
lakes
and
the
mountains
Now
now
Viktor
said
Karkaroff
with
laugh
that
didn
reach
his
cold
eyes
don
giving
away
anything
else
now
your
charming
friend
will
know
exactly
where
find
Dumbledore
smiled
his
eyes
twinkling
Igor
all
this
secrecy
one
would
almost
think
you
didn
want
visitors
Well
Dumbledore
said
Karkaroff
displaying
his
yellowing
teeth
their
fullest
extent
are
all
protective
our
private
domains
are
not
not
jealously
guard
the
halls
learning
that
have
been
entrusted
Are
not
right
proud
that
alone
know
our
school
secrets
and
right
protect
them
would
never
dream
assuming
know
all
Hogwarts
secrets
Igor
said
Dumbledore
amicably
Only
this
morning
for
instance
took
wrong
turning
the
way
the
bathroom
and
found
myself
beautifully
proportioned
room
have
never
seen
before
containing
really
rather
magnificent
collection
chamber
pots
When
went
back
investigate
more
closely
discovered
that
the
room
had
vanished
But
must
keep
eye
out
for
Possibly
only
accessible
five
thirty
the
morning
may
only
appear
the
quarter
moon
when
the
seeker
has
exceptionally
full
bladder
Harry
snorted
into
his
plate
goulash
Percy
frowned
but
Harry
could
have
sworn
Dumbledore
had
given
him
very
small
wink
Meanwhile
Fleur
Delacour
was
criticizing
the
Hogwarts
decorations
Roger
Davies
Zis
nothing
she
said
dismissively
looking
around
the
sparkling
walls
the
Great
Hall
Palace
Beauxbatons
ave
ice

chamber
Chreestmas
Zey

She
slapped
her
hand
onto
the
table
impatiently
Roger
Davies
was
watching
her
talk
with
very
dazed
look
his
face
and
kept
missing
his
mouth
with
his
fork
Harry
had
the
impression
that
Davies
was
too
busy
staring
Fleur
take
word
she
was
saying
Absolutely
right
said
quickly
slapping
his
own
hand
down
the
table
imitation
Fleur
Like
that
Yeah
Harry
looked
around
the
Hall
Hagrid
was
sitting
one
the
other
staff
tables
was
back
his
horrible
hairy
brown
suit
and
gazing
the
top
table
Harry
saw
him
give
small
wave
and
looking
around
saw
Madame
Maxime
return
her
opals
glittering
the
candlelight
Hermione
was
now
teaching
Krum
say
her
name
properly
kept
calling
her
Hermy
own
Her
nee
she
said
slowly
and
clearly
Herm
own
ninny
Close
enough
she
said
catching
Harry
eye
and
grinning
When
all
the
food
had
been
consumed
Dumbledore
stood
and
asked
the
students
the
same
Then
with
wave
his
wand
all
the
tables
zoomed
back
along
the
walls
leaving
the
floor
clear
and
then
conjured
raised
platform
into
existence
along
the
right
wall
set
drums
several
guitars
lute
cello
and
some
bagpipes
were
set
upon
The
Weird
Sisters
now
trooped
onto
the
stage
wildly
enthusiastic
applause
they
were
all
extremely
hairy
and
dressed
black
robes
that
had
been
artfully
ripped
and
torn
They
picked
their
instruments
and
Harry
who
had
been
interested
watching
them
that
had
almost
forgotten
what
was
coming
suddenly
realized
that
the
lanterns
all
the
other
tables
had
gone
out
and
that
the
other
champions
and
their
partners
were
standing
Come
Parvati
hissed
supposed
dance
Harry
tripped
over
his
dress
robes
stood
The
Weird
Sisters
struck
slow
mournful
tune
Harry
walked
onto
the
brightly
lit
dance
floor
carefully
avoiding
catching
anyone
eye
could
see
Seamus
and
Dean
waving
him
and
sniggering
and
next
moment
Parvati
had
seized
his
hands
placed
one
around
her
waist
and
was
holding
the
other
tightly
hers
wasn
bad
could
have
been
Harry
thought
revolving
slowly
the
spot
Parvati
was
steering
kept
his
eyes
fixed
over
the
heads
the
watching
people
and
very
soon
many
them
too
had
come
onto
the
dance
floor
that
the
champions
were
longer
the
center
attention
Neville
and
Ginny
were
dancing
nearby
could
see
Ginny
wincing
frequently
Neville
trod
her
feet
and
Dumbledore
was
waltzing
with
Madame
Maxime
was
dwarfed
her
that
the
top
his
pointed
hat
barely
tickled
her
chin
however
she
moved
very
gracefully
for
woman
large
Mad
Eye
Moody
was
doing
extremely
ungainly
two
step
with
Professor
Sinistra
who
was
nervously
avoiding
his
wooden
leg
Nice
socks
Potter
Moody
growled
passed
his
magical
eye
staring
through
Harry
robes
yeah
Dobby
the
house
elf
knitted
them
for
said
Harry
grinning
creepy
Parvati
whispered
Moody
clunked
away
don
think
that
eye
should
allowed
Harry
heard
the
final
quavering
note
from
the
bagpipe
with
relief
The
Weird
Sisters
stopped
playing
applause
filled
the
hall
once
more
and
Harry
let
Parvati
once
Let
sit
down
shall
but
this
really
good
one
Parvati
said
the
Weird
Sisters
struck
new
song
which
was
much
faster
don
like
Harry
lied
and
led
her
away
from
the
dance
floor
past
Fred
and
Angelina
who
were
dancing
exhuberantly
that
people
around
them
were
backing
away
fear
injury
and
over
the
table
where
Ron
and
Padma
were
sitting
How
going
Harry
asked
Ron
sitting
down
and
opening
bottle
butterbeer
Ron
didn
answer
was
glaring
Hermione
and
Krum
who
were
dancing
nearby
Padma
was
sitting
with
her
arms
and
legs
crossed
one
foot
jiggling
time
the
music
Every
now
and
then
she
threw
disgruntled
look
Ron
who
was
completely
ignoring
her
Parvati
sat
down
Harry
other
side
crossed
her
arms
and
legs
too
and
within
minutes
was
asked
dance
boy
from
Beauxbatons
You
don
mind

Harry
Parvati
said
What
said
Harry
who
was
now
watching
Cho
and
Cedric
never
mind
snapped
Parvati
and
she
went
off
with
the
boy
from
Beauxbatons
When
the
song
ended
she
did
not
return
Hermione
came
over
and
sat
down
Parvati
empty
chair
She
was
bit
pink
the
face
from
dancing
said
Harry
Ron
didn
say

Hermione
fanning
herself
with
her
hand
Viktors

withering
look

Hermione
looked

surprise
What

said

Ron
scathingly
not

him
then
Harry

against

when

and
blushed
deeply

Ron

When

voice
quivered

Then

Ron
Don

Hermione
jumped
her
feet
and
stormed
off
across
the
dance
floor
disappearing
into
the
crowd
Ron
watched
her
with
mixture
anger
and
satisfaction
his
face
Are

Ron
still
glaring
after
Hermione

the
whole
point
you
know
international
magical
cooperation
Harry
displeasure
Percy
now
took
Padma
vacated
seat
The
top
table
was
now
empty
Professor
Dumbledore
was
dancing
with
Professor
Sprout
Ludo
Bagman
with
Professor
McGonagall
Madame
Maxime
and
Hagrid
were
cutting
wide
path
around
the
dance
floor
they
waltzed
through
the
students
and
Karkaroff
was
nowhere
seen
When
the
next
song
ended
everybody
applauded
once
more
and
Harry
saw
Ludo
Bagman
kiss
Professor
McGonagall
hand
and
make
his
way
back
through
the
crowds
which
point
Fred
and
George
accosted
him
What
they
think
they
doing
annoying
senior
Ministry
members
Percy
hissed
watching
Fred
and
George
suspiciously
respect
Ludo
Bagman
shook
off
Fred
and
George
fairly
quickly
however
and
spotting
Harry
waved
and
came
over
their
table
hope
brothers
weren
bothering
you
Bagman
said
Percy
once
What
not
all
not
all
said
Bagman
they
were
just
telling
bit
more
about
those
fake
wands
theirs
Wondering
could
advise
them
the
marketing
promised
put
them
touch
with
couple
contacts
mine
Zonko
Joke
Shop
Percy
didn
look
happy
about
this
all
and
Harry
was
prepared
bet
would
rushing
tell
Mrs
Weasley
about
this
the
moment
got
home
Apparently
Fred
and
George
plans
had
grown
even
more
ambitious
lately
they
were
hoping
sell
the
public
Bagman
opened
his
mouth
ask
Harry
something
but
Percy
diverted
him
How
you
feel
the
tournament
going
Bagman
Our
department
quite
satisfied
the
hitch
with
the
Goblet
Fire
glanced
Harry
was
little
unfortunate
course
but
seems
have
gone
very
smoothly
since
don
you
think
yes
Bagman
said
cheerfully
all
been
enormous
fun
How
old
Barty
doing
Shame
couldn
come
sure
Crouch
will
and
about
time
said
Percy
importantly
but
the
meantime
more
than
willing
take
the
slack
course
not
all
attending
balls
laughed
airily
had
deal
with
all
sorts
things
that
have
cropped
his
absence
you
heard
Ali
Bashir
was
caught
smuggling
consignment
flying
carpets
into
the
country
And
then
been
trying
persuade
the
Transylvanians
sign
the
International
Ban
Dueling
got
meeting
with
their
Head
Magical
Cooperation
the
new
year
Let
for
walk
Ron
muttered
Harry
get
away
from
Percy
Pretending
they
wanted
more
drinks
Harry
and
Ron
left
the
table
edged
around
the
dance
floor
and
slipped
out
into
the
entrance
hall
The
front
doors
stood
open
and
the
fluttering
fairy
lights
the
rose
garden
winked
and
twinkled
they
went
down
the
front
steps
where
they
found
themselves
surrounded
bushes
winding
ornamental
paths
and
large
stone
statues
Harry
could
hear
splashing
water
which
sounded
like
fountain
Here
and
there
people
were
sitting
carved
benches
and
Ron
set
off
along
one
the
winding
paths
through
the
rosebushes
but
they
had
gone
only
short
way
when
they
heard
unpleasantly
familiar
voice
don
see
what
there
fuss
about
Igor
Severus
you
cannot
pretend
this
isn
happening
Karkaroffs
voice
sounded
anxious
and
hushed
though
keen
not
overheard
been
getting
clearer
and
clearer
for
months
becoming
seriously
concerned
can
deny
Then
flee
said
Snapes
voice
curtly
Flee
will
make
your
excuses
however
remaining
Hogwarts
Snape
and
Karkaroff
came
around
the
corner
Snape
had
his
wand
out
and
was
blasting
rosebushes
apart
his
expression
most
ill
natured
Squeals
issued
from
many
the
bushes
and
dark
shapes
emerged
from
them
Ten
points
from
Ravenclaw
Fawcett
Snape
snarled
girl
ran
past
him
And
ten
points
from
Hufflepuff
too
Stebbins
boy
went
rushing
after
her
And
what
are
you
two
doing
added
catching
sight
Harry
and
Ron
the
path
ahead
Karkaroff
Harry
saw
looked
slightly
discomposed
see
them
standing
there
His
hand
went
nervously
his
goatee
and
began
winding
around
his
finger
walking
Ron
told
Snape
shortly
Not
against
the
law
Keep
walking
then
Snape
snarled
and
brushed
past
them
his
long
black
cloak
billowing
out
behind
him
Karkaroff
hurried
away
after
Snape
Harry
and
Ron
continued
down
the
path
What
got
Karkaroff
all
worried
Ron
muttered
And
since
when
have
and
Snape
been
first
name
terms
said
Harry
slowly
They
had
reached
large
stone
reindeer
now
over
which
they
could
see
the
sparkling
jets
tall
fountain
The
shadowy
outlines
two
enormous
people
were
visible
stone
bench
watching
the
water
the
moonlight
And
then
Harry
heard
Hagrid
speak
Momen
saw
yeh
knew
was
saying
oddly
husky
voice
Harry
and
Ron
froze
This
didn
sound
like
the
sort
scene
they
ought
walk
somehow
Harry
looked
around
back
the
path
and
saw
Fleur
Delacour
and
Roger
Davies
standing
half
concealed
rosebush
nearby
tapped
Ron
the
shoulder
and
jerked
his
head
toward
them
meaning
that
they
could
easily
sneak
off
that
way
without
being
noticed
Fleur
and
Davies
looked
very
busy
Harry
but
Ron
eyes
widening
horror
the
sight
Fleur
shook
his
head
vigorously
and
pulled
Harry
deeper
into
the
shadows
behind
the
reindeer
What
did
you
know
Agrid
said
Madame
Maxime
purr
her
low
voice
Harry
definitely
didn
want
listen
this
knew
Hagrid
would
hate
overheard
situation
like
this
certainly
would
have
had
been
possible
would
have
put
his
fingers
his
ears
and
hummed
loudly
but
that
wasn
really
option
Instead
tried
interest
himself
beetle
crawling
along
the
stone
reindeer
back
but
the
beetle
just
wasn
interesting
enough
block
out
Hagrid
next
words
jus
knew
knew
you
were
like
Was
yer
mother
yer
father
don
know
what
you
mean
Agrid
was
mother
said
Hagrid
quietly
She
was
one
the
las
ones
Britain
Course
can
remember
her
too
well
she
left
see
When
was
abou
three
She
wasn
really
the
maternal
sort
Well
not
their
natures
Dunno
what
happened
her
might
dead
fer
all
know
Madame
Maxime
didn
say
anything
And
Harry
spite
himself
took
his
eyes
off
the
beetle
and
looked
over
the
top
the
reindeer
antlers
listening
had
never
heard
Hagrid
talk
about
his
childhood
before
dad
was
broken
hearted
when
she
wen
Tiny
little
bloke
dad
was
the
time
was
six
could
lift
him
put
him
top
the
dresser
annoyed
Used
ter
make
him
laugh
Hagrid
deep
voice
broke
Madame
Maxime
was
listening
motionless
apparently
staring
the
silvery
fountain
Dad
raised
but
died
course
jus
after
started
school
Sorta
had
ter
make
own
way
after
that
Dumbledore
was
real
help
mind
Very
kind
ter
was
Hagrid
pulled
out
large
spotted
silk
handkerchief
and
blew
his
nose
heavily
anyway
enough
abou
What
about
you
Which
side
you
got
But
Madame
Maxime
had
suddenly
got
her
feet
chilly
she
said
but
whatever
the
weather
was
doing
was
nowhere
near
cold
her
voice
think
will
now
said
Hagrid
blankly
don
never
met
another
one
before
Anuzzer
what
precisely
said
Madame
Maxime
her
tone
icy
Harry
could
have
told
Hagrid
was
best
not
answer
stood
there
the
shadows
gritting
his
teeth
hoping
against
hope
wouldn
but
was
good
Another
half
giant
course
said
Hagrid
dare
you
shrieked
Madame
Maxime
Her
voice
exploded
through
the
peaceful
night
air
like
foghorn
behind
him
Harry
heard
Fleur
and
Roger
fall
out
their
rosebush
ave
nevair
been
more
insulted
life
Alf
giant
Moi
ave
ave
big
bones
She
stormed
away
great
multicolored
swarms
fairies
rose
into
the
air
she
passed
angrily
pushing
aside
bushes
Hagrid
was
still
sitting
the
bench
staring
after
her
was
much
too
dark
make
out
his
expression
Then
after
about
minute
stood
and
strode
away
not
back
the
castle
but
off
out
into
the
dark
grounds
the
direction
his
cabin
mon
Harry
said
very
quietly
Ron
Let
But
Ron
didn
move
What
said
Harry
looking
him
Ron
looked
around
Harry
his
expression
very
serious
indeed
Did
you
know
whispered
About
Hagrid
being
half
giant
Harry
said
shrugging
what
knew
immediately
from
the
look
Ron
was
giving
him
that
was
once
again
revealing
his
ignorance
the
wizarding
world
Brought
the
Dursleys
there
were
many
things
that
wizards
took
for
granted
that
were
revelations
Harry
but
these
surprises
had
become
fewer
with
each
successive
year
Now
however
could
tell
that
most
wizards
would
not
have
said
what
upon
finding
out
that
one
their
friends
had
giantess
for
mother
explain
inside
said
Ron
quietly
mon
Fleur
and
Roger
Davies
had
disappeared
probably
into
more
private
clump
bushes
Harry
and
Ron
returned
the
Great
Hall
Parvati
and
Padma
were
now
sitting
distant
table
with
whole
crowd
Beauxbatons
boys
and
Hermione
was
once
more
dancing
with
Krum
Harry
and
Ron
sat
down
table
far
removed
from
the
dance
floor
Harry
prompted
Ron
What
the
problem
with
giants
Well
they
they
Ron
struggled
for
words
not
very
nice
finished
lamely
Who
cares
Harry
said
There
nothing
wrong
with
Hagrid
know
there
isn
but
blimey
wonder
keeps
quiet
Ron
said
shaking
his
head
always
thought
got
the
way
bad
Engorgement
Charm
when
was
kid
something
Didn
like
mention
But
what
matter
his
mother
was
giantess
said
Harry
Well
one
who
knows
him
will
care
cos
they
know
not
dangerous
said
Ron
slowly
But
Harry
they
just
vicious
giants
like
Hagrid
said
their
natures
they
like
trolls
they
just
like
killing
everyone
knows
that
There
aren
any
left
Britain
now
though
What
happened
them
Well
they
were
dying
out
anyway
and
then
loads
got
themselves
killed
Aurors
There
supposed
giants
abroad
though
They
hide
out
mountains
mostly
don
know
who
Maxime
thinks
she
kidding
Harry
said
watching
Madame
Maxime
sitting
alone
the
judges
table
looking
very
somber
Hagrid
half
giant
she
definitely
Big
bones
the
only
thing
that
got
bigger
bones
than
her
dinosaur
Harry
and
Ron
spent
the
rest
the
ball
discussing
giants
their
corner
neither
them
having
any
inclination
dance
Harry
tried
not
watch
Cho
and
Cedric
too
much
gave
him
strong
desire
kick
something
When
the
Weird
Sisters
finished
playing
midnight
everyone
gave
them
last
loud
round
applause
and
started
wend
their
way
into
the
entrance
hall
Many
people
were
expressing
the
wish
that
the
ball
could
have
gone
longer
but
Harry
was
perfectly
happy
going
bed
far
was
concerned
the
evening
hadn
been
much
fun
Out
the
entrance
hall
Harry
and
Ron
saw
Hermione
saying
good
night
Krum
before
went
back
the
Durmstrang
ship
She
gave
Ron
very
cold
look
and
swept
past
him
the
marble
staircase
without
speaking
Harry
and
Ron
followed
her
but
halfway
the
staircase
Harry
heard
someone
calling
him
Hey
Harry
was
Cedric
Diggory
Harry
could
see
Cho
waiting
for
him
the
entrance
hall
below
Yeah
said
Harry
coldly
Cedric
ran
the
stairs
toward
him
Cedric
looked
though
didn
want
say
whatever
was
front
Ron
who
shrugged
looking
bad
tempered
and
continued
climb
the
stairs
Listen
Cedric
lowered
his
voice
Ron
disappeared
owe
you
one
for
telling
about
the
dragons
You
know
that
golden
egg
Does
yours
wail
when
you
open
Yeah
said
Harry
Well
take
bath
okay
What
Take
bath
and
take
the
egg
with
you
and
just
mull
things
over
the
hot
water
help
you
think
Trust
Harry
stared
him
Tell
you
what
Cedric
said
use
the
prefects
bathroom
Fourth
door
the
left
that
statue
Boris
the
Bewildered
the
fifth
floor
Password
pine
fresh
Gotta
want
say
good
night
grinned
Harry
again
and
hurried
back
down
the
stairs
Cho
Harry
walked
back
Gryffindor
Tower
alone
That
had
been
extremely
strange
advice
Why
would
bath
help
him
work
out
what
the
wailing
egg
meant
Was
Cedric
pulling
his
leg
Was
trying
make
Harry
look
like
fool
Cho
would
like
him
even
more
comparison
The
Fat
Lady
and
her
friend
were
snoozing
the
picture
over
the
portrait
hole
Harry
had
yell
Fairy
lights
before
woke
them
and
when
did
they
were
extremely
irritated
climbed
into
the
common
room
and
found
Ron
and
Hermione
having
blazing
row
Standing
ten
feet
apart
they
were
bellowing
each
other
each
scarlet
the
face
Well
you
don
like
you
know
what
the
solution
don
you
yelled
Hermione
her
hair
was
coming
down
out
its
elegant
bun
now
and
her
face
was
screwed
anger
yeah
Ron
yelled
back
What
that
Next
time
there
ball
ask
before
someone
else
does
and
not
last
resort
Ron
mouthed
soundlessly
like
goldfish
out
water
Hermione
turned
her
heel
and
stormed
the
girls
staircase
bed
Ron
turned
look
Harry
Well
sputtered
looking
thunderstruck
well
that
just
proves
completely
missed
the
point
Harry
didn
say
anything
liked
being
back
speaking
terms
with
Ron
too
much
speak
his
mind
right
now
but
somehow
thought
that
Hermione
had
gotten
the
point
much
better
than
Ron
had
CHAPTER
TWENTY
FOUR
RITA
SKEETER
SCOOP
Everybody
got
late
Boxing
Day
The
Gryffindor
common
room
was
much
quieter
than
had
been
lately
many
yawns
punctuating
the
lazy
conversations
Hermione
hair
was
bushy
again
she
confessed
Harry
that
she
had
used
liberal
amounts
Sleekeazy
Hair
Potion
for
the
ball
but
way
too
much
bother
every
day
she
said
matter
factly
scratching
purring
Crookshanks
behind
the
ears
Ron
and
Hermione
seemed
have
reached
unspoken
agreement
not
discuss
their
argument
They
were
being
quite
friendly
each
other
though
oddly
formal
Ron
and
Harry
wasted
time
telling
Hermione
about
the
conversation
they
had
overheard
between
Madame
Maxime
and
Hagrid
but
Hermione
didn
seem
find
the
news
that
Hagrid
was
half
giant
nearly
shocking
Ron
did
Well
thought
must
she
said
shrugging
knew
couldn
pure
giant
because
they
about
twenty
feet
tall
But
honestly
all
this
hysteria
about
giants
They
can
all
horrible
the
same
sort
prejudice
that
people
have
toward
werewolves
just
bigotry
isn
Ron
looked
though
would
have
liked
reply
scathingly
but
perhaps
didn
want
another
row
because
contented
himself
with
shaking
his
head
disbelievingly
while
Hermione
wasn
looking
was
time
now
think
the
homework
they
had
neglected
during
the
first
week
the
holidays
Everybody
seemed
feeling
rather
flat
now
that
Christmas
was
over
everybody
except
Harry
that
who
was
starting
once
again
feel
slightly
nervous
The
trouble
was
that
February
the
twenty
fourth
looked
lot
closer
from
this
side
Christmas
and
still
hadn
done
anything
about
working
out
the
clue
inside
the
golden
egg
therefore
started
taking
the
egg
out
his
trunk
every
time
went
the
dormitory
opening
and
listening
intently
hoping
that
this
time
would
make
some
sense
strained
think
what
the
sound
reminded
him
apart
from
thirty
musical
saws
but
had
never
heard
anything
else
like
closed
the
egg
shook
vigorously
and
opened
again
see
the
sound
had
changed
but
hadn
tried
asking
the
egg
questions
shouting
over
all
the
wailing
but
nothing
happened
even
threw
the
egg
across
the
room
though
hadn
really
expected
that
help
Harry
had
not
forgotten
the
hint
that
Cedric
had
given
him
but
his
less
than
friendly
feelings
toward
Cedric
just
now
meant
that
was
keen
not
take
his
help
could
avoid
any
case
seemed
him
that
Cedric
had
really
wanted
give
Harry
hand
would
have
been
lot
more
explicit
Harry
had
told
Cedric
exactly
what
was
coming
the
first
task
and
Cedric
idea
fair
exchange
had
been
tell
Harry
take
bath
Well
didn
need
that
sort
rubbishy
help
not
from
someone
who
kept
walking
down
corridors
hand
hand
with
Cho
anyway
And
the
first
day
the
new
term
arrived
and
Harry
set
off
lessons
weighed
down
with
books
parchment
and
quills
usual
but
also
with
the
lurking
worry
the
egg
heavy
his
stomach
though
were
carrying
that
around
with
him
too
Snow
was
still
thick
upon
the
grounds
and
the
greenhouse
windows
were
covered
condensation
thick
that
they
couldn
see
out
them
Herbology
Nobody
was
looking
forward
Care
Magical
Creatures
much
this
weather
though
Ron
said
the
skrewts
would
probably
warm
them
nicely
either
chasing
them
blasting
off
forcefully
that
Hagrid
cabin
would
catch
fire
When
they
arrived
Hagrid
cabin
however
they
found
elderly
witch
with
closely
cropped
gray
hair
and
very
prominent
chin
standing
before
his
front
door
Hurry
now
the
bell
rang
five
minutes
ago
she
barked
them
they
struggled
toward
her
through
the
snow
Who
you
said
Ron
staring
her
Wheres
Hagrid
name
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
she
said
briskly
your
temporary
Care
Magical
Creatures
teacher
Where
Hagrid
Harry
repeated
loudly
indisposed
said
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
shortly
Soft
and
unpleasant
laughter
reached
Harrys
ears
turned
Draco
Malfoy
and
the
rest
the
Slytherins
were
joining
the
class
All
them
looked
gleeful
and
none
them
looked
surprised
see
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
This
way
please
said
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
and
she
strode
off
around
the
paddock
where
the

were
shivering
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
followed
her
looking
back
over
their
shoulders
Hagrid
cabin
All
the
curtains
were
closed
Was
Hagrid
there
alone
and
ill
What
wrong
with
Hagrid
Harry
said
hurrying
catch
with
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
Never
you
mind
she
said
though
she
thought
was
being
nosy
mind
though
said
Harry
hotly
What
with
him
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
acted
though
she
couldn
hear
him
She
led
them
past
the
paddock
where
the
huge
Beauxbatons
horses
were
standing
huddled
against
the
cold
and
toward
tree
the
edge
the
forest
where
large
and
beautiful
unicorn
was
tethered
Many
the
girls
ooooohed
the
sight
the
unicorn
beautiful
whispered
Lavender
Brown
How
did
she
get
They
supposed
really
hard
catch
The
unicorn
was
brightly
white
made
the
snow
all
around
look
gray
was
pawing
the
ground
nervously
with
its
golden
hooves
and
throwing
back
its
horned
head
Boys

back
barked
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
throwing
out
arm
and
catching
Harry
hard
the
chest
They
prefer
the
woman

unicorns
Girls

front
and
approach
with
care

does
She
and
the
girls
walked
slowly
forward
toward
the
unicorn
leaving
the
boys
standing
near
the
paddock
fence
watching
The
moment
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
was
out
earshot
Harry
turned
Ron
What

Harry

Harry

before

that

Harry
finished
reading
and
looked
Ron
whose
mouth
was
hanging
open
How
did
she
find
out
whispered
But
that
wasn
what
was
bothering
Harry
What
you

Hagrid
Harry
spat
Malfoy
What
this
rubbish
about
him
pointed
Crabbe
getting

off

They
haven
even
got

Crabbe
was
sniggering
apparently
very
pleased
with
himself
Well
think
this
should
put

the
oaf

said
Malfoy
his

glinting
Half

and
there
was
thinking
just
swallowed

Skele

when
was

None
the

all
They
worried

You
Are
you
paying
attention
over
there
Professor
Grubbly
Planks
voice
carried
over
the
boys
the
girls
were
all
clustered
around
the
unicorn
now
stroking
Harry
was
angry
that
the
Daily
Prophet
article
shook
his
hands
turned
stare
unseeingly
the
unicorn
whose
many
magical
properties
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
was
now
enumerating
loud
voice
that
the
boys
could
hear
too
hope
she
stays
that
woman
said
Parvati
Patil
when
the
lesson
had
ended
and
they
were
all
heading
back
the
castle
for
lunch
That
more
what
thought
Care
Magical
Creatures
would
like
proper
creatures
like
unicorns
not
monsters
What
about
Hagrid
Harry
said
angrily
they
went
the
steps
What
about
him
said
Parvati
hard
voice
can
still
gamekeeper
can
Parvati
had
been
very
cool
toward
Harry
since
the
ball
supposed
that
ought
have
paid
her
bit
more
attention
but
she
seemed
have
had
good
time
all
the
same
She
was
certainly
telling
anybody
who
would
listen
that
she
had
made
arrangements
meet
the
boy
from
Beauxbatons
Hogsmeade
the
next
weekend
trip
That
was
really
good
lesson
said
Hermione
they
entered
the
Great
Hall
didn
know
half
the
things
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
told
about
uni
Look
this
Harry
snarled
and
shoved
the
Daily
Prophet
article
under
Hermione
nose
Hermione
mouth
fell
open
she
read
Her
reaction
was
exactly
the
same
Ron
How
did
that
horrible
Skeeter
woman
find
out
You
don
think
Hagrid
told
her
said
Harry
leading
the
way
over
the
Gryffindor
table
and
throwing
himself
into
chair
furious
never
even
told
did
reckon
she
was
mad
wouldn
give
her
loads
horrible
stuff
about
she
went
ferreting
around
get
him
back
Maybe
she
heard
him
telling
Madame
Maxime
the
ball
said
Hermione
quietly
have
seen
her
the
garden
said
Ron
Anyway
she
not
supposed
come
into
school
anymore
Hagrid
said
Dumbledore
banned
her
Maybe
she
got
Invisibility
Cloak
said
Harry
ladling
chicken
casserole
onto
his
plate
and
splashing
everywhere
his
anger
Sort
thing
she
isn
hide
bushes
listening
people
Like
you
and
Ron
did
you
mean
said
Hermione
weren
trying
hear
him
said
Ron
indignantly
didn
have
any
choice
The
stupid
prat
talking
about
his
giantess
mother
where
anyone
could
have
heard
him
got
and
see
him
said
Harry
This
evening
after
Divination
Tell
him
want
him
back
you
want
him
back
shot
Hermione
well
not
going
pretend
didn
make
nice
change
having
proper
Care
Magical
Creatures
lesson
for
once
but
want
Hagrid
back
course
Hermione
added
hastily
quailing
under
Harry
furious
stare
that
evening
after
dinner
the
three
them
left
the
castle
once
more
and
went
down
through
the
frozen
grounds
Hagrid
cabin
They
knocked
and
Fang
booming
barks
answered
Hagrid
Harry
shouted
pounding
the
door
Open
Hagrid
didn
answer
They
could
hear
Fang
scratching
the
door
whining
but
didn
open
They
hammered
for
ten
more
minutes
Ron
even
went
and
banged
one
the
windows
but
there
was
response
What
avoiding
for
Hermione
said
when
they
had
finally
given
and
were
walking
back
the
school
surely
doesn
think
care
about
him
being
half
giant
But
seemed
that
Hagrid
did
care
They
didn
see
sign
him
all
week
didn
appear
the
staff
table
mealtimes
they
didn
see
him
going
about
his
gamekeeper
duties
the
grounds
and
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
continued
take
the
Care
Magical
Creatures
classes
Malfoy
was
gloating
every
possible
opportunity
Missing
your
half
breed
pal
kept
whispering
Harry
whenever
there
was
teacher
around
that
was
safe
from
Harry
retaliation
Missing
the
elephant
man
There
was
Hogsmeade
visit
halfway
through
January
Hermione
was
very
surprised
that
Harry
was
going
just
thought
you
want
take
advantage
the
common
room
being
quiet
she
said
Really
get
work
that
egg
reckon
got
pretty
good
idea
what
about
now
Harry
lied
Have
you
really
said
Hermione
looking
impressed
Well
done
Harrys
insides
gave
guilty
squirm
but
ignored
them
still
had
five
weeks
work
out
that
egg
clue
after
all
and
that
was
ages
whereas
went
into
Hogsmeade
might
run
into
Hagrid
and
get
chance
persuade
him
come
back
Ron
and
Hermione
left
the
castle
together
Saturday
and
set
off
through
the
cold
wet
grounds
toward
the
gates
they
passed
the
Durmstrang
ship
moored
the
lake
they
saw
Viktor
Krum
emerge
onto
the
deck
dressed
nothing
but
swimming
trunks
was
very
skinny
indeed
but
apparently
lot
tougher
than
looked
because
climbed
onto
the
side
the
ship
stretched
out
his
arms
and
dived
right
into
the
lake
mad
said
Harry
staring
Krums
dark
head
bobbed
out
into
the
middle
the
lake
must
freezing
January
lot
colder
where
comes
from
said
Hermione
suppose
feels
quite
warm
him
Yeah
but
there
still
the
giant
squid
said
Ron
didn
sound
anxious
anything
sounded
hopeful
Hermione
noticed
his
tone
voice
and
frowned
really
nice
you
know
she
said
not
all
like
you
think
coming
from
Durmstrang
likes
much
better
here
told
Ron
said
nothing
hadn
mentioned
Viktor
Krum
since
the
ball
but
Harry
had
found
miniature
arm
under
his
bed
Boxing
Day
which
had
looked
very
much
though
had
been
snapped
off
small
model
figure
wearing
Bulgarian
Quidditch
robes
Harry
kept
his
eyes
skinned
for
sign
Hagrid
all
the
way
down
the
slushy
High
Street
and
suggested
visit
the
Three
Broomsticks
once
had
ascertained
that
Hagrid
was
not
any
the
shops
The
pub
was
crowded
ever
but
one
quick
look
around
all
the
tables
told
Harry
that
Hagrid
wasn
there
Heart
sinking
went
the
bar
with
Ron
and
Hermione
ordered
three
butterbeers
from
Madam
Rosmerta
and
thought
gloomily
that
might
just
well
have
stayed
behind
and
listened
the
egg
wailing
after
all
Doesn
ever
into
the
office
Hermione
whispered
suddenly
Look
She
pointed
into
the
mirror
behind
the
bar
and
Harry
saw
Ludo
Bagman
reflected
there
sitting
shadowy
corner
with
bunch
goblins
Bagman
was
talking
very
fast
low
voice
the
goblins
all
whom
had
their
arms
crossed
and
were
looking
rather
menacing
was
indeed
odd
Harry
thought
that
Bagman
was
here
the
Three
Broomsticks
weekend
when
there
was
Triwizard
event
and
therefore
judging
done
watched
Bagman
the
mirror
was
looking
strained
again
quite
strained
had
that
night
the
forest
before
the
Dark
Mark
had
appeared
But
just
then
Bagman
glanced
over
the
bar
saw
Harry
and
stood
moment
moment
Harry
heard
him
say
brusquely
the
goblins
and
Bagman
hurried
through
the
pub
toward
Harry
his
boyish
grin
back
place
Harry
said
How
are
you
Been
hoping
run
into
you
Everything
going
all
right
Fine
thanks
said
Harry
Wonder
could
have
quick
private
word
Harry
said
Bagman
eagerly
You
couldn
give
moment
you
two
could
you
okay
said
Ron
and
and
Hermione
went
off
find
table
Bagman
led
Harry
along
the
bar
the
end
furthest
from
Madam
Rosmerta
Well
just
thought
congratulate
you
again
your
splendid
performance
against
that
Horntail
Harry
said
Bagman
Really
superb
Thanks
said
Harry
but
knew
this
couldn
all
that
Bagman
wanted
say
because
could
have
congratulated
Harry
front
Ron
and
Hermione
Bagman
didn
seem
any
particular
rush
spill
the
beans
though
Harry
saw
him
glance
into
the
mirror
over
the
bar
the
goblins
who
were
all
watching
him
and
Harry
silence
through
their
dark
slanting
eyes
Absolute
nightmare
said
Bagman
Harry
undertone
noticing
Harry
watching
the
goblins
too
Their
English
isn
too
good
like
being
back
with
all
the
Bulgarians
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
but
least
they
used
sign
language
another
human
could
recognize
This
lot
keep
gabbling
Gobblede
gook
and
only
know
one
word
Gobbledegook
Bladvak
means
pickax
don
like
use
case
they
think
threatening
them
gave
short
booming
laugh
What
they
want
Harry
said
noticing
how
the
goblins
were
still
watching
Bagman
very
closely
well
said
Bagman
looking
suddenly
nervous
They
they
looking
for
Barty
Crouch
Why
are
they
looking
for
him
here
said
Harry
the
Ministry
London
isn
matter
fact
idea
where
said
Bagman
sort
stopped
coming
work
Been
absent
for
couple
weeks
now
Young
Percy
his
assistant
says
ill
Apparently
just
been
sending
instructions
owl
But
would
you
mind
not
mentioning
that
anyone
Harry
Because
Rita
Skeeter
still
poking
around
everywhere
she
can
and
willing
bet
she
work
Bartys
illness
into
something
sinister
Probably
say
gone
missing
like
Bertha
Jorkins
Have
you
heard
anything
about
Bertha
Jorkins
Harry
asked
said
Bagman
looking
strained
again
got
people
looking
course
About
time
thought
Harry
and
all
very
strange
She
definitely
arrived
Albania
because
she
met
her
second
cousin
there
And
then
she
left
the
cousin
house
south
and
see
aunt
and
she
seems
have
vanished
without
trace
route
Blowed
can
see
where
she
got
she
doesn
seem
the
type
elope
for
instance
but
still
What
are
doing
talking
about
goblins
and
Bertha
Jorkins
really
wanted
ask
you
lowered
his
voice
how
are
you
getting
with
your
golden
egg
not
bad
Harry
said
untruthfully
Bagman
seemed
know
wasn
being
honest
Listen
Harry
said
still
very
low
voice
feel
very
bad
about
all
this
you
were
thrown
into
this
tournament
you
didn
volunteer
for
and
his
voice
was
quiet
now
Harry
had
lean
closer
listen
can
help
all
prod
the
right
direction
taken
liking
you
the
way
you
got
past
that
dragon
well
just
say
the
word
Harry
stared
into
Bagman
round
rosy
face
and
his
wide
baby
blue
eyes
supposed
work
out
the
clues
alone
aren
said
careful
keep
his
voice
casual
and
not
sound
though
was
accusing
the
head
the
Department
Magical
Games
and
Sports
breaking
the
rules
Well
well
yes
said
Bagman
impatiently
but
come
Harry
all
want
Hogwarts
victory
don
Have
you
offered
Cedric
help
Harry
said
The
smallest
frowns
creased
Bagman
smooth
face
haven
said
well
like
say
taken
liking
you
Just
thought
offer
Well
thanks
said
Harry
but
think
nearly
there
with
the
egg
couple
more
days
should
crack
wasn
entirely
sure
why
was
refusing
Bagman
help
except
that
Bagman
was
almost
stranger
him
and
accepting
his
assistance
would
feel
somehow
much
more
like
cheating
than
asking
advice
from
Ron
Hermione
Sirius
Bagman
looked
almost
affronted
but
couldn
say
much
more
Fred
and
George
turned
that
point
Hello
Bagman
said
Fred
brightly
Can
buy
you
drink
said
Bagman
with
last
disappointed
glance
Harry
thank
you
boys
Fred
and
George
looked
quite
disappointed
Bagman
who
was
surveying
Harry
though
had
let
him
down
badly
Well
must
dash
said
Nice
seeing
you
all
Good
luck
Harry
hurried
out
the
pub
The
goblins
all
slid
off
their
chairs
and
exited
after
him
Harry
went
rejoin
Ron
and
Hermione
What
did
want
Ron
said
the
moment
Harry
had
sat
down
offered
help
with
the
golden
egg
said
Harry
shouldn
doing
that
said
Hermione
looking
very
shocked
one
the
judges
And
anyway
you
already
worked
out
haven
you
nearly
said
Harry
Well
don
think
Dumbledore
would
like
knew
Bagman
was

Hermione
now
striding
along
fast
that
was
all

keep
with
her
The

Breaking

led
them
all
the
way
back
the
road
through
the
gates
flanked
winged

and
through
the
grounds
Hagrid
cabin
The
curtains
were
still
drawn
and
they
could
hear
Fang
barking
they
approached
Hagrid
Hermione
shouted
pounding
his
front
door
Hagrid
that

Nobody

The
door
opened
Hermione
said
About
and
then
stopped
very
suddenly
because
she
had
found
herself
face
face
not
with
Hagrid
but
with
Albus
Dumbledore
Good

said
pleasantly
smiling
down
them
wanted

Hagrid
said
Hermione
rather
small
voice
Yes

said
Dumbledore
his
eyes
twinkling
Why
don
you

okay
said
Hermione
She
Ron
and
Harry
went
into
the
cabin
Fang
launched
himself
upon
Harry
the
moment
entered
barking
madly
and
trying
lick
his
ears
Harry
fended
off
Fang
and
looked
around
Hagrid
was
sitting
his
table
where
there
were
two
large
mugs
tea
looked
real
mess
His
face
was
blotchy
his
eyes
swollen
and
had
gone
the
other
extreme
where
his
hair
was
concerned
far
from
trying
make
behave
now
looked
like
wig
tangled
wire
Hagrid
said
Harry
Hagrid
looked

very
hoarse

behind
Harry
Ron
and

drawing
out
his

and
twiddling

tray
appeared
midair
along
with
plate
cakes
Dumbledore
magicked
the
tray
onto
the
table
and
everybody
sat
down
There
was
slight
pause
and
then
Dumbledore
said
Did
you
any
chance
hear
what
Miss
Granger
was
shouting
Hagrid
Hermione
went
slightly
pink
but
Dumbledore
smiled
her
and
continued
Hermione
Harry
and
Ron

seem
want

you
judging
the
way
they
were
attempting

quickly
looking
Dumbledore

temporarily
deaf
and

Harry
said
Dumbledore
twiddling
his
thumbs
and
staring
the
ceiling
right
said
Harry
sheepishly
just
meant
Hagrid
how
could
you
think
care
what
that
woman
wrote
about
you
Two
fat
tears
leaked
out
Hagrid
beetle
black
eyes
and
fell
slowly
into
his
tangled
beard
Living

Dumbledore

over

half
moon
spectacles
Not

Hagrid
gulped
More
tears
leaked
out
down
his
cheeks
and
into
his
tangled
beard
Dumbledore

Dumbledore
left
the
cabin
pausing
only
scratch
Fangs
ears
When
the
door
had
shut
behind
him
Hagrid
began
sob
into
his
dustbin
lid
sized
hands
Hermione
kept
patting
his
arm
and
last
Hagrid
looked
his
eyes
very
red
indeed
and
said
Great

Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
looked
one
another
nervously
Harry
would
rather
have
taken
fifty
Blast
Ended
Skrewts
for
walk
than
admit
Hagrid
that
had
overheard
him
talking
Madame
Maxime
but
Hagrid
was
still
talking
apparently
unaware
that
had
said
anything
odd
Yeh

Lying

Harry
went
back
the
castle
later
that
afternoon
with
Ron
and
Hermione
unable
banish
the
image
the
happy
expression
Hagrid
whiskery
face
had
imagined
Harry
winning
the
tournament
The
incomprehensible
egg
weighed
more
heavily
than
ever
Harrys
conscience
that
evening
and
the
time
had
got
into
bed
had
made
his
mind
was
time
shelve
his
pride
and
see
Cedric
hint
was
worth
anything
CHAPTER
TWENTY
FIVE
THE
EGG
AND
THE
EYE
Harry
had
idea
how
long
bath
would
need
work
out
the
secret
the
golden
egg
decided
night
when
would

take
much

Reluctant
though
was

more

from
Cedric
also
decided

fewer
people
were
allowed

less
likely
that
would

Harry
planned
his
excursion
carefully
because
had
been
caught
out
bed
and
out
bounds
Filch
the
caretaker
the
middle
the
night
once
before
and
had
desire
repeat
the
experience
The
Invisibility
Cloak
would
course
essential
and
added
precaution
Harry
thought
would
take
the
Marauders
Map
which
next
the
cloak
was
the
most
useful
aid
rule
breaking
Harry
owned
The
map
showed
the
whole
Hogwarts
including
its
many
shortcuts
and
secret
passageways
and
most
important
all
revealed
the
people
inside
the
castle
minuscule
labeled
dots
moving
around
the
corridors
that
Harry
would
forewarned
somebody
was
approaching
the
bathroom
Thursday
night
Harry
sneaked
bed
put
the
cloak
crept
back
downstairs
and
just
had
done
the
night
when
Hagrid
had
shown
him
the
dragons
waited
for
the
portrait
hole
open
This
time
was
Ron
who
waited
outside
give
the
Fat
Lady
the
password
banana
fritters
Good
luck
Ron
muttered
climbing
into
the
room
Harry
crept
out
past
him
was
awkward
moving
under
the
cloak
tonight
because
Harry
had
the
heavy
egg
under
one
arm
and
the
map
held
front
his
nose
with
the
other
However
the
moonlit
corridors
were
empty
and
silent
and
checking
the
map
strategic
intervals
Harry
was
able
ensure
that
wouldn
run
into
anyone
wanted
avoid
When
reached
the
statue
Boris
the
Bewildered
lost
looking
wizard
with
his
gloves
the
wrong
hands
located
the
right
door
leaned
close
and
muttered
the
password
Pine
fresh
just
Cedric
had
told
him
The
door
creaked
open
Harry
slipped
inside
bolted
the
door
behind
him
and
pulled
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
looking
around
His
immediate
reaction
was
that
would
worth
becoming
prefect
just
able
use
this
bathroom
was
softly
lit
splendid
candle
filled
chandelier
and
everything
was
made
white
marble
including
what
looked
like
empty
rectangular
swimming
pool
sunk
into
the
middle
the
floor
About
hundred
golden
taps
stood
all
around
the
pools
edges
each
with
differently
colored
Jewel
set
into
its
handle
There
was
also
diving
board
Long
white
linen
curtains
hung
the
windows
large
pile
fluffy
white
towels
sat
corner
and
there
was
single
golden
framed
painting
the
wall
featured
blonde
mermaid
who
was
fast
asleep
rock
her
long
hair
over
her
face
fluttered
every
time
she
snored
Harry
moved
forward
looking
around
his
footsteps
echoing
off
the
walls
Magnificent
though
the
bathroom
was
and
quite
keen
though
was
try
out
few
those
taps
now
was
here
couldn
quite
suppress
the
feeling
that
Cedric
might
have
been
having
him
How
earth
was
this
supposed
help
solve
the
mystery
the
egg
Nevertheless
put
one
the
Huffy
towels
the
cloak
the
map
and
the
egg
the
side
the
swimming
pool
sized
bath
then
knelt
down
and
turned
few
the
taps
could
tell
once
that
they
carried
different
sorts
bubble
bath
mixed
with
the
water
though
wasn
bubble
bath
Harry
had
ever
experienced
One
tap
gushed
pink
and
blue
bubbles
the
size
footballs
another
poured
ice
white
foam
thick
that
Harry
thought
would
have
supported
his
weight
cared
test
third
sent
heavily
perfumed
purple
clouds
hovering
over
the
surface
the
water
Harry
amused
himself
for
awhile
turning
the
taps
and
off
particularly
enjoying
the
effect
one
whose
jet
bounced
off
the
surface
the
water
large
arcs
Then
when
the
deep
pool
was
full
hot
water
foam
and
bubbles
which
took
very
short
time
considering
its
size
Harry
turned
off
all
the
taps
pulled
off
his
pajamas
slippers
and
dressing
gown
and
slid
into
the
water
was
deep
that
his
feet
barely
touched
the
bottom
and
actually
did
couple
lengths
before
swimming
back
the
side
and
treading
water
staring
the
egg
Highly
enjoyable
though
was
swim
hot
and
foamy
water
with
clouds
different
colored
steam
wafting
all
around
him
stroke
brilliance
came
him
sudden
burst
understanding
Harry
stretched
out
his
arms
lifted
the
egg
his
wet
hands
and
opened
The
wailing
screeching
sound
filled
the
bathroom
echoing
and
reverberating
off
the
marble
walls
but
sounded
just
incomprehensible
ever
not
more
with
all
the
echoes
snapped
shut
again
worried
that
the
sound
would
attract
Filch
wondering
whether
that
hadn
been
Cedric
plan
and
then
making
him
jump
badly
that
dropped
the
egg
which
clattered
away
across
the
bathroom
floor
someone
spoke
try
putting
the
water
were
you
Harry
had
swallowed
considerable
amount
bubbles
shock
stood
sputtering
and
saw
the
ghost
very
glum
looking
girl
sitting
cross
legged
top
one
the
taps
was
Moaning
Myrtle
who
was
usually
heard
sobbing
the
bend
toilet
three
floors
below
Myrtle
Harry
said
outrage
not
wearing
anything
The
foam
was
dense
that
this
hardly
mattered
but
had
nasty
feeling
that
Myrtle
had
been
spying
him
from
out
one
the
taps
ever
since
had
arrived
closed
eyes
when
you
got
she
said
blinking
him
through
her
thick
spectacles
You
haven
been
see
for
ages
Yeah
well
said
Harry
bending
his
knees
slightly
just
make
absolutely
sure
Myrtle
couldn
see
anything
but
his
head
not
supposed
come
into
your
bathroom
girls
one
You
didn
used
care
said
Myrtle
miserably
You
used
there
all
the
time
This
was
true
though
only
because
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
found
Myrtle
out
order
toilets
convenient
place
brew
Polyjuice
Potion
secret
forbidden
potion
that
had
turned
him
and
Ron
into
living
replicas
Crabbe
and
Goyle
for
hour
that
they
could
sneak
into
the
Slytherin
common
room
got
told
off
for
going
there
said
Harry
which
was
half
true
Percy
had
once
caught
him
coming
out
Myrtles
bathroom
thought
better
not
come
back
after
that
see
said
Myrtle
picking
spot
her
chin
morose
sort
way
Well
anyway
try
the
egg
the
water
That
what
Cedric
Diggory
did
Have
you
been
spying
him
too
said
Harry
indignantly
What
you
sneak
here
the
evenings
watch
the
prefects
take
baths
Sometimes
said
Myrtle
rather
slyly
but
never
come
out
speak
anyone
before
honored
said
Harry
darkly
You
keep
your
eyes
shut
made
sure
Myrtle
had
her
glasses
well
covered
before
hoisting
himself
out
the
bath
wrapping
the
towel
firmly
around
his
waist
and
going
retrieve
the
egg
Once
was
back
the
water
Myrtle
peered
through
her
fingers
and
said
then
open
under
the
water
Harry
lowered
the
egg
beneath
the
foamy
surface
and
opened
and
this
time
did
not
wail
gurgling
song
was
coming
out
song
whose
words
couldnt
distinguish
through
the
water
You
need
put
your
head
under
too
said
Myrtle
who
seemed
thoroughly
enjoying
bossing
him
around
Harry
took
great
breath
and
slid
under
the
surface
and
now
sitting
the
marble
bottom
the
bubble
filled
bath
heard
chorus
eerie
voices
singing
him
from
the
open
egg
his
hands
Come
seek
where
our
voices
sound
cannot
sing
above
the
ground
And
while
you
searching
ponder
this
Wove
taken
what
you
sorely
miss
hour
long
you
have
look
And
recover
what
took
But
past
hour
the
prospect
black
Too
late
gone
wont
come
back
Harry
let
himself
float
back
upward
and
broke
the
bubbly
surface
shaking
his
hair
out
his
eyes
Hear
said
Myrtle
Yeah
Come
seek
where
our
voices
sound
and
need
persuading
hang
need
listen
again
sank
back
beneath
the
water
took
three
more
underwater
renditions
the
egg
song
before
Harry
had
memorized
then
trod
water
for
while
thinking
hard
while
Myrtle
sat
and
watched
him
got
and
look
for
people
who
can
use
their
voices
above
the
ground
said
slowly
who
could
that
Slow
aren
you
had
never
seen
Moaning
Myrtle
cheerful
apart
from
the
day
when
dose
PolyJuice
Potion
had
given
Hermione
the
hairy
face
and
tail
cat
Harry
stared
around
the
bathroom
thinking
the
voices
could
only
heard
underwater
then
made
sense
for
them
belong
underwater
creatures
ran
this
theory
past
Myrtle
who
smirked
him
Well
thats
what
Diggory
thought
she
said
lay
there
talking
himself
for
ages
about
Ages
and
ages
nearly
all
the
bubbles
had
gone
Underwater
Harry
said
slowly
Myrtle
what
lives
the
lake
apart
from
the
giant
squid
all
sorts
she
said
sometimes
down
there
sometimes
don
have
any
choice
someone
flushes
toilet
when
not
expecting
Trying
not
think
about
Moaning
Myrtle
zooming
down
pipe
the
lake
with
the
contents
toilet
Harry
said
Well
does
anything
there
have
human
voice
Hang
Harry
eyes
had
fallen
the
picture
the
snoozing
mermaid
the
wall
Myrtle
there
aren
merpeople
there
are
there
Oooh
very
good
she
said
her
thick
glasses
twinkling
took
Diggory
much
longer
than
that
And
that
was
with
her
awake
too
Myrtle
jerked
her
head
toward
the
mermaid
with
expression
great
dislike
her
glum
face
giggling
and
showing
off
and
flashing
her
fins
Thats
isn
said
Harry
excitedly
The
second
tasks
and
find
the
merpeople
the
lake
and
and
But
suddenly
realized
what
was
saying
and
felt
the
excitement
drain
out
him
though
someone
had
just
pulled
plug
his
stomach
wasn
very
good
swimmer
never
had
much
practice
Dudley
had
had
lessons
his
youth
but
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
doubt
hoping
that
Harry
would
drown
one
day
hadn
bothered
give
him
any
couple
lengths
this
bath
were
all
very
well
but
that
lake
was
very
large
and
very
deep
and
merpeople
would
surely
live
right
the
bottom
Myrtle
Harry
said
slowly
how
supposed
breathe
this
Myrtle
eyes
filled
with
sudden
tears
again
Tactless
she
muttered
groping
her
robes
for
handkerchief
What
tactless
said
Harry
bewildered
Talking
about
breathing
front
she
said
shrilly
and
her
voice
echoed
loudly
around
the
bathroom
When
can
when
haven
not
for
ages
She
buried
her
face
her
handkerchief
and
sniffed
loudly
Harry
remembered
how
touchy
Myrtle
had
always
been
about
being
dead
but
none
the
other
ghosts
knew
made
such
fuss
about
Sorry
said
impatiently
didn
mean
just
forgot
yes
very
easy
forget
Myrtle
dead
said
Myrtle
gulping
looking
him
out
swollen
eyes
Nobody
missed
even
when
was
alive
Took
them
hours
and
hours
find
body
know
was
sitting
there
waiting
for
them
Olive
Hornby
came
into
the
bathroom
Are
you
here
again
sulking
Myrtle
she
said
because
Professor
Dippet
asked
look
for
you
And
then
she
saw
body
ooooh
she
didn
forget
until
her
dying
day
made
sure
that
followed
her
around
and
reminded
her
did
remember
her
brother
wedding
But
Harry
wasn
listening
was
thinking
about
the
merpeople
song
again
taken
what
you
sorely
miss
That
sounded
though
they
were
going
steal
something
his
something
had
get
back
What
were
they
going
take
and
then
course
she
went
the
Ministry
Magic
stop
stalking
her
had
come
back
here
and
live
toilet
Good
said
Harry
vaguely
Well
lot
further
than
was
Shut
your
eyes
again
will
you
getting
out
retrieved
the
egg
from
the
bottom
the
bath
climbed
out
dried
himself
and
pulled
his
pajamas
and
dressing
gown
again
Will
you
come
and
visit
bathroom
again
sometime
Moaning
Myrtle
asked
mournfully
Harry
picked
the
Invisibility
Cloak
try
Harry
said
though
privately
thinking
the
only
way
visiting
Myrtle
bathroom
again
was
every
other
toilet
the
castle
got
blocked
See
you
Myrtle
thanks
for
your
help
Bye
bye
she
said
gloomily
and
Harry
put
the
Invisibllity
Cloak
saw
her
zoom
back
the
tap
Out
the
dark
corridor
Harry
examined
the
Marauders
Map
check
that
the
coast
was
still
clear
Yes
the
dots
belonging
Filch
and
his
cat
Mrs
Norris
were
safely
their
office
nothing
else
seemed
moving
apart
from
Peeves
though
was
bouncing
around
the
trophy
room
the
floor
above
Harry
had
taken
his
first
step
back
toward
Gryffindor
Tower
when
something
else
the
map
caught
his
eye
something
distinctly
odd
Peeves
was
not
the
only
thing
that
was
moving
single
dot
was
flitting
around
room
the
bottom
left
hand
corner
Snapes
office
But
the
dot
wasn
labeled
Severus
Snape
was
Bartemius
Crouch
Harry
stared
the
dot
Crouch
was
supposed
too
ill
work
come
the
Yule
Ball
what
was
doing
sneaking
into
Hogwarts
one
clock
the
morning
Harry
watched
closely
the
dot
moved
around
and
around
the
room
pausing
here
and
there
Harry
hesitated
thinking
and
then
his
curiosity
got
the
better
him
turned
and
set
off
the
opposite
direction
toward
the
nearest
staircase
was
going
see
what
Crouch
was
Harry
walked
down
the
stairs
quietly
possible
though
the
faces
some
the
portraits
still
turned
curiously
the
squeak
floorboard
the
rustle
his
pajamas
crept
along
the
corridor
below
pushed
aside
tapestry
about
halfway
along
and
proceeded
down
narrower
staircase
shortcut
that
would
take
him
down
two
floors
kept
glancing
down
the
map
wondering
just
didn
seem
character
somehow
for
correct
law
abiding
Crouch
sneaking
around
somebody
else
office
this
late
night
And
then
halfway
down
the
staircase
not
thinking
about
what
was
doing
not
concentrating
anything
but
the
peculiar
behavior
Crouch
Harrys
leg
suddenly
sank
right
through
the
trick
step
Neville
always
forgot
jump
gave
ungainly
wobble
and
the
golden
egg
still
damp
from
the
bath
slipped
from
under
his
arm
lurched
forward
try
and
catch
but
too
late
the
egg
fell
down
the
long
staircase
with
bang
loud
bass
drum
every
step
the
Invisibility
Cloak
slipped
Harry
snatched
and
the
Marauder
Map
fluttered
out
his
hand
and
slid
down
six
stairs
where
sunk
the
step
above
his
knee
couldn
reach
The
golden
egg
fell
through
the
tapestry
the
bottom
the
staircase
burst
open
and
began
wailing
loudly
the
corridor
below
Harry
pulled
out
his
wand
and
struggled
touch
the
Marauder
Map
wipe
blank
but
was
too
far
away
reach
Pulling
the
cloak
back
over
himself
Harry
straightened
listening
hard
with
his
eyes
screwed
with
fear
and
almost
immediately
PEEVES
was
the
unmistakable
hunting
cry
Filch
the
caretaker
Harry
could
hear
his
rapid
shuffling
footsteps
coming
nearer
and
nearer
his
wheezy
voice
raised
fury
What
this
racket
Wake
the
whole
castle
will
you
have
you
Peeves
have
you
you
and
what
this
Filch
footsteps
halted
there
was
clink
metal
metal
and
the
wailing
stopped
Filch
had
picked
the
egg
and
closed
Harry
stood
very
still
one
leg
still
Jammed
tightly
the
magical
step
listening
Any
moment
now
Filch
was
going
pull
aside
the
tapestry
expecting
see
Peeves
and
there
would
Peeves
but
came
the
stairs
would
spot
the
Marauder
Map
and
Invisibility
Cloak
not
the
map
would
show
Harry
Potter
standing
exactly
where
was
Egg
Filch
said
quietly
the
foot
the
stairs
sweet
Mrs
Norris
was
obviously
with
him
This
Triwizard
clue
This
belongs
school
champion
Harry
felt
sick
his
heart
was
hammering
very
fast
PEEVES
Filch
roared
gleefully
You
been
stealing
ripped
back
the
tapestry
below
and
Harry
saw
his
horrible
pouchy
face
and
bulging
pale
eyes
staring
the
dark
and
Filch
deserted
staircase
Hiding
are
you
said
softly
coming
get
you
Peeves
You
gone
and
stolen
Triwizard
clue
Peeves
Dumbledore
have
you
out
here
for
this
you
filthy
pilfering
poltergeist
Filch
started
climb
the
stairs
his
scrawny
dust
colored
cat
his
heels
Mrs
Morris
lamp
like
eyes
very
like
her
masters
were
fixed
directly
upon
Harry
had
had
occasion
before
now
wonder
whether
the
Invisibility
Cloak
worked
cats
Sick
with
apprehension
watched
Filch
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
his
old
flannel
dressing
gown
tried
desperately
pull
his
trapped
leg
free
but
merely
sank
few
more
inches
any
second
now
Filch
was
going
spot
the
map
walk
right
into
him
Filch
Whats
going
Filch
stopped
few
steps
below
Harry
and
turned
the
foot
the
stairs
stood
the
only
person
who
could
make
Harry
situation
worse
Snape
was
wearing
long
gray
nightshirt
and
looked
livid
Its
Peeves
Professor
Filch
whispered
malevolently
threw
this
egg
down
the
stairs
Snape
climbed
the
stairs
quickly
and
stopped
beside
Filch
Harry
gritted
his
teeth
convinced
his
loudly
thumping
heart
would
give
him
away
any
second
Peeves
said
Snape
softly
staring
the
egg
Filch
hands
But
Peeves
couldn
get
into
office
This
egg
was
your
office
Professor
course
not
Snape
snapped
heard
banging
and
wailing
Yes
Professor
that
was
the
egg
was
coming
investigate
Peeves
threw
Professor
and
when
passed
office
saw
that
the
torches
were
lit
and
cupboard
door
was
ajar
Somebody
has
been
searching
But
Peeves
couldn
know
couldn
Filch
Snape
snapped
again
seal
office
with
spell
none
but
wizard
could
break
Snape
looked
the
stairs
straight
through
Harry
and
then
down
into
the
corridor
below
want
you
come
and
help
search
for
the
intruder
Filch
yes
Professor
but
Filch
looked
yearningly
the
stairs
right
through
Harry
who
could
see
that
was
very
reluctant
forgo
the
chance
cornering
Peeves
Harry
pleaded
with
him
silently
with
Snape
Mrs
Norris
was
peering
around
Filch
legs
Harry
had
the
distinct
impression
that
she
could
smell
him
Why
had
filled
that
bath
with
much
perfumed
foam
The
thing
Professor
said
Filch
plaintively
the
headmaster
will
have
listen
this
time
Peeves
has
been
stealing
from
student
might
chance
get
him
thrown
out
the
castle
once
and
for
all
Filch
don
give
damn
about
that
wretched
poltergeist
office
that
Clunk
Clunk
Clunk
Snape
stopped
talking
very
abruptly
and
Filch
both
looked
down
the
foot
the
stairs
Harry
saw
Mad
Eye
Moody
limp
into
sight
through
the
narrow
gap
between
their
heads
Moody
was
wearing
his
old
traveling
cloak
over
his
nightshirt
and
leaning
his
staff
usual
Pajama
party
growled
the
stairs
Professor
Snape
and
heard
noises
Professor
said
Filch
once
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
throwing
things
around
usual
and
then
Professor
Snape
discovered
that
someone
had
broken
into
his
off
Shut
Snape
hissed
Filch
Moody
took
step
closer
the
foot
the
stairs
Harry
saw
Moodys
magical
eye
travel
over
Snape
and
then
unmistakably
onto
himself
Harrys
heart
gave
horrible
jolt
Moody
could
see
through
Invisibility
Cloaks
alone
could
see
the
full
strangeness
the
scene
Snape
his
nightshirt
Filch
clutching
the
egg
and
Harry
trapped
the
stairs
behind
them
Moody
lopsided
gash
mouth
opened
surprise
For
few
seconds
and
Harry
stared
straight
into
each
other
eyes
Then
Moody
closed
his
mouth
and
turned
his
blue
eye
upon
Snape
again
Did
hear
that
correctly
Snape
asked
slowly
Someone
broke
into
your
office
unimportant
said
Snape
coldly
the
contrary
growled
Moody
very
important
Who
want
break
into
your
office
student

said
Snape
Harry
could
see
vein
flickering
horribly
Snape

mixtures

Reckon

said
Moody
Not

Harry
saw
the
edge
Snapes
sallow
face
turn
nasty
brick
color
the
vein
his
temple
pulsing
more
rapidly
You
know
hiding
nothing
Moody
said
soft
and
dangerous
voice
you
searched

pretty
thoroughly
yourself
Moodys
face
twisted
into
smile
Auror

Snape

Snape
through

growled
Moody
Hes

Believes
second

But
say
there
are
spots
that
don
come
off
Snape
Spots
that
never
come
off
you
know
what
mean
Snape
suddenly
did
something
very
strange
seized
his
left
forearm
convulsively
with
his
right
hand
though
something
had
hurt
him
Moody
laughed
Get
back
bed
Snape
You
don
have
the
authority
send
anywhere
Snape
hissed
letting
his
arm
though
angry
with
himself
have
much
right
prowl
this
school
after
dark
you
Prowl
away
said
Moody
but
his
voice
was
full
menace
look
forward
meeting
you
dark
corridor
some
time
You
dropped
something
the
way
With
stab
horror
Harry
saw
Moody
point
the
Marauders
Map
still
lying
the
staircase
six
steps
below
him
Snape
and
Filch
both
turned
look
Harry
threw
caution
the
winds
raised
his
arms
under
the
cloak
and
waved
furiously
Moody
attract
his
attention
mouthing
mine
Mine
Snape
had
reached
out
for
horrible
expression
dawning
comprehension
his
face
Accio
Parchment
The
map
flew
into
the
air
slipped
through
Snapes
outstretched
fingers
and
soared
down
the
stairs
into
Moodys
hand
mistake
Moody
said
calmly
mine
must
dropped
earlier
But
Snape
black
eyes
were
darting
from
the
egg
Filch
arms
the
map
Moodys
hand
and
Harry
could
tell
was
putting
two
and
two
together
only
Snape
could
Potter
said
quietly
What
that
said
Moody
calmly
folding
the
map
and
pocketing
Potter
Snape
snarled
and
actually
turned
his
head
and
stared
right
the
place
where
Harry
was
though
could
suddenly
see
him
That
egg
Potters
egg
That
piece
parchment
belongs
Potter
have
seen
before
recognize
Potter
here
Potter
his
Invisibility
Cloak
Snape
stretched
out
his
hands
like
blind
man
and
began
move
the
stairs
Harry
could
have
sworn
his
over
large
nostrils
were
dilating
trying
sniff
Harry
out
trapped
Harry
leaned
backward
trying
avoid
Snapes
fingertips
but
any
moment
now
There
nothing
there
Snape
barked
Moody
but
happy
tell
the
headmaster
how
quickly
your
mind
jumped
Harry
Potter
Meaning
what
Snape
turned
again
look
Moody
his
hands
still
outstretched
inches
from
Harry
chest
Meaning
that
Dumbledore
very
interested
know
who
got
for
that
boy
said
Moody
limping
nearer
still
the
foot
the
stairs
And
Snape
very
interested
The
torchlight
flickered
across
his
mangled
face
that
the
scars
and
the
chunk
missing
from
his
nose
looked
deeper
and
darker
than
ever
Snape
was
looking
down
Moody
and
Harry
couldn
see
the
expression
his
face
For
moment
nobody
moved
said
anything
Then
Snape
slowly
lowered
his
hands
merely
thought
said
Snape
voice
forced
calm
that
Potter
was
wandering
around
after
hours
again
unfortunate
habit
his
should
stopped
For
for
his
own
safety
see
said
Moody
softly
Got
Potter
best
interests
heart
have
you
There
was
pause
Snape
and
Moody
were
still
staring
each
other
Mrs
Norris
gave
loud
meow
still
peering
around
Filch
legs
looking
for
the
source
Harry
bubble
bath
smell
think
will
back
bed
Snape
said
curtly
Best
idea
you
had
all
night
said
Moody
Now
Filch
you
just
give
that
egg
said
Filch
clutching
the
egg
though
were
his
firstborn
son
Professor
Moody
this
evidence
Peeves
treachery
the
property
the
champion
stole
from
said
Moody
Hand
over
now
Snape
swept
downstairs
and
passed
Moody
without
another
word
Filch
made
chirruping
noise
Mrs
Norris
who
stared
blankly
Harry
for
few
more
seconds
before
turning
and
following
her
master
Still
breathing
very
fast
Harry
heard
Snape
walking
away
down
the
corridor
Filch
handed
Moody
the
egg
and
disappeared
from
view
too
muttering
Mrs
Norris
Never
mind
sweet
see
Dumbledore
the
morning
tell
him
what
Peeves
was
door
slammed
Harry
was
left
staring
down
Moody
who
placed
his
staff
the
bottommost
stair
and
started
climb
laboriously
toward
him
dull
clunk
every
other
step
Close
shave
Potter
muttered
Yeah
thanks
said
Harry
weakly
What
this
thing
said
Moody
drawing
the
Marauder
Map
out
his
pocket
and
unfolding
Map
Hogwarts
said
Harry
hoping
Moody
was
going
pull
him
out
the
staircase
soon
his
leg
was
really
hurting
him
Merlins
beard
Moody
whispered
staring
the
map
his
magical
eye
going
haywire
This
this
some
map
Potter
Yeah
its
quite
useful
Harry
said
His
eyes
were
starting
water
from
the
pain
Professor
Moody
you
think
you
could
help
What
Yes
yes
course
Moody
took
hold
Harrys
arms
and
pulled
Harrys
leg
came
free
the
trick
step
and
climbed
onto
the
one
above
Moody
was
still
gazing
the
map
Potter
said
slowly
you
didn
happen
any
chance
see
who
broke
into
Snapes
office
did
you
this
map
mean
yeah
did
Harry
admitted
was
Crouch
Moodys
magical
eye
whizzed
over
the
entire
surface
the
map
looked
suddenly
alarmed
Crouch
said
You
you
sure
Potter
Positive
said
Harry
Well
not
here
anymore
said
Moody
his
eye
still
whizzing
over
the
map
Crouch
that
very
very
interesting
said
nothing
for
almost
minute
still
staring
the
map
Harry
could
tell
that
this
news
meant
something
Moody
and
very
much
wanted
know
what
was
wondered
whether
dared
ask
Moody
scared
him
slightly
yet
Moody
had
just
helped
him
avoid
awful
lot
trouble
Professor
Moody
why
you
reckon
Crouch
wanted
look
around
Snapes
office
Moodys
magical
eye
left
the
map
and
fixed
quivering
upon
Harry
was
penetrating
glare
and
Harry
had
the
impression
that
Moody
was
sizing
him
wondering
whether
answer
not
how
much
tell
him
Put
this
way
Potter
Moody
muttered
finally
they
say
old
Mad
Eye
obsessed
with
catching
Dark
wizards
but
nothing
nothing
compared
Barty
Crouch
continued
stare
the
map
Harry
was
burning
know
more
Professor
Moody
said
again
you
think
could
this
have
anything
with
maybe
Crouch
thinks
there
something
going
Like
what
said
Moody
sharply
Harry
wondered
how
much
dare
say
didn
want
Moody
guess
that
had
source
information
outside
Hogwarts
that
might
lead
tricky
questions
about
Sirius
don
know
Harry
muttered
odd
stuffs
been
happening
lately
hasn
been
the
Daily
Prophet
the
Dark
Mark
the
World
Cup
and
the
Death
Eaters
and
everything
Both
Moody
mismatched
eyes
widened
You
sharp
boy
Potter
said
His
magical
eye
roved
back
the
Marauder
Map
Crouch
could
thinking
along
those
lines
said
slowly
Very
possible
there
have
been
some
funny
rumors
flying
around
lately
helped
along
Rita
Skeeter
course
making
lot
people
nervous
reckon
grim
smile
twisted
his
lopsided
mouth
there
one
thing
hate
muttered
more
himself
than
Harry
and
his
magical
eye
was
fixed
the
left
hand
corner
the
map
its
Death
Eater
who
walked
free
Harry
stared
him
Could
Moody
possibly
mean
what
Harry
thought
meant
And
now
want
ask
you
question
Potter
said
Moody
more
businesslike
tone
Harrys
heart
sank
had
thought
this
was
coming
Moody
was
going
ask
where
had
got
this
map
which
was
very
dubious
magical
object
and
the
story
how
had
fallen
into
his
hands
incriminated
not
only
him
but
his
own
father
Fred
and
George
Weasley
and
Professor
Lupin
their
last
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
Moody
waved
the
map
front
Harry
who
braced
himself
Can
borrow
this
said
Harry
was
very
fond
his
map
but
the
other
hand
was
extremely
relieved
that
Moody
wasn
asking
where
got
and
there
was
doubt
that
owed
Moody
favor
Yeah
okay
Good
boy
growled
Moody
can
make
good
use
this
this
might
exactly
what
been
looking
for
Right
bed
Potter
come
now
They
climbed
the
top
the
stairs
together
Moody
still
examining
the
map
though
was
treasure
the
like
which
had
never
seen
before
They
walked
silence
the
door
Moody
office
where
stopped
and
looked
Harry
You
ever
thought
career
Auror
Potter
said
Harry
taken
aback
You
want
consider
said
Moody
nodding
and
looking
Harry
thoughtfully
Yes
indeed
and
incidentally
guessing
you
werent
Just
taking
that
egg
for
walk
tonight
said
Harry
grinning
been
working
out
the
clue
Moody
winked
him
his
magical
eye
going
haywire
again
Nothing
like
nighttime
stroll
give
you
ideas
Potter
See
you
the
morning
went
back
into
his
office
staring
down
the
Marauders
Map
again
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
Harry
walked
slowly
back
Gryffindor
Tower
lost
thought
about
Snape
and
Crouch
and
what
all
meant
Why
was
Crouch
pretending
ill
could
manage
get
Hogwarts
when
wanted
What
did
think
Snape
was
concealing
his
office
And
Moody
thought
Harry
ought
Auror
Interesting
idea
but
somehow
Harry
thought
got
quietly
into
his
four
poster
ten
minutes
later
the
egg
and
the
cloak
now
safely
back
his
trunk
thought
like
check
how
scarred
the
rest
them
were
before
chose
career
CHAPTER
TWENTY
SIX
THE
SECOND
TASK
You
said
you
already
worked
out
that
egg
clue
said
Hermione
indignantly
Keep
your
voice
down
said
Harry
crossly
just
need
sort
fine
tune
all
right
Ron
and
Hermione
were
sitting
the
very
back
the
Charms
class
with
table
themselves
They
were
supposed
practicing
the
opposite
the
Summoning
Charm
today
the
Banishing
Charm
Owing
the
potential
for
nasty
accidents
when
objects
kept
flying
across
the
room
Professor
Flitwick
had
given
each
student
stack
cushions
which
practice
the
theory
being
that
these
wouldn
hurt
anyone
they
went
off
target
was
good
theory
but
wasn
working
very
well
Neville
aim
was
poor
that
kept
accidentally
sending
much
heavier
things
flying
across
the
room
Professor
Flitwick
for
instance
Just
forget
the
egg
for
minute
all
right
Harry
hissed
Professor
Flitwick
went
whizzing
resignedly
past
them
landing
top
large
cabinet
trying
tell
you
about
Snape
and
Moody
This
class
was
ideal
cover
for
private
conversation
everyone
was
having
far
too
much
fun
pay
them
any
attention
Harry
had
been
recounting
his
adventures
the
previous
night
whispered
installments
for
the
last
half
hour
Snape
said
Moodys
searched
his
office
well
Ron
whispered
his
eyes
alight
with
interest
Banished
cushion
with
sweep
his
wand
soared
into
the
air
and
knocked
Parvati
hat
off
What
you
reckon
Moody
here
keep
eye
Snape
well
Karkaroff
Well
dunno
that
what
Dumbledore
asked
him
but
definitely
doing
said
Harry
waving
his
wand
without
paying
much
attention
that
his
cushion
did
odd
sort
belly
flop
off
the
desk
Moody
said
Dumbledore
only
lets
Snape
stay
here
because
giving
him
second
chance
something
What
said
Ron
his
eyes
widening
his
next
cushion
spinning
high
into
the
air
ricocheting
off
the
chandelier
and
dropping
heavily
onto
Flitwick
desk
Harry
maybe
Moody
thinks
Snape
put
your
name
the
Goblet
Fire
Ron
said
Hermione
shaking
her
head
sceptically
thought
Snape
was
trying
kill
Harry
before
and
turned
out
was
saving
Harry
life
remember
She
Banished
cushion
and
flew
across
the
room
and
landed
the
box
they
were
all
supposed
aiming
Harry
looked
Hermione
thinking
was
true
that
Snape
had
saved
his
life
once
but
the
odd
thing
was
Snape
definitely
loathed
him
just
loathed
Harry
father
when
they
had
been
school
together
Snape
loved
taking
points
from
Harry
and
had
certainly
never
missed
opportunity
give
him
punishments
even
suggest
that
should
suspended
from
the
school
don
care
what
Moody
says
Hermione
went
Dumbledore
not
stupid
was
right
trust
Hagrid
and
Professor
Lupin
even
though
loads
people
wouldn
have
given
them
jobs
why
shouldn
right
about
Snape
even
Snape
bit
evil
said
Ron
promptly
Come
Hermione
why
are
all
these
Dark
wizard
catchers
searching
his
office
then
Why
has
Crouch
been
pretending
ill
said
Hermione
ignoring
Ron
Its
bit
funny
isn
that
cant
manage
come
the
Yule
Ball
but
can
get
here
the
middle
the
night
when
wants
You
just
don
like
Crouch
because
that
elf
Winky
said
Ron
sending
cushion
soaring
into
the
window
You
just
want
think
Snapes
something
said
Hermione
sending
her
cushion
zooming
neatly
into
the
box
just
want
know
what
Snape
did
with
his
first
chance
his
second
one
said
Harry
grimly
and
his
cushion
his
very
great
surprise
flew
straight
across
the
room
and
landed
neatly
top
Hermione
Obedient
Sirius
wish
hearing
about
anything
odd
Hogwarts
Harry
sent
him
letter
brown
owl
that
night
explaining
all
about
Crouch
breaking
into
Snape
office
and
Moody
and
Snape
conversation
Then
Harry
turned
his
attention
earnest
the
most
urgent
problem
facing
him
how
survive
underwater
for
hour
the
twenty
fourth
February
Ron
quite
liked
the
idea
using
the
Summoning
Charm
again
Harry
had
explained
about
Aqua
Lungs
and
Ron
couldn
see
why
Harry
shouldn
Summon
one
from
the
nearest
Muggle
town
Hermione
squashed
this
plan
pointing
out
that
the
unlikely
event
that
Harry
managed
learn
how
operate
Aqua
Lung
within
the
set
limit
hour
was
sure
disqualified
for
breaking
the
International
Code
Wizarding
Secrecy
was
too
much
hope
that
Muggles
would
spot
Aqua
Lung
zooming
across
the
countryside
Hogwarts
course
the
ideal
solution
would
for
you
Transfigure
yourself
into
submarine
something
Hermione
said
only
done
human
Transfiguration
already
But
don
think
start
that
until
sixth
year
and
can
badly
wrong
you
don
know
what
you
doing
Yeah
don
fancy
walking
around
with
periscope
sticking
out
head
said
Harry
pose
could
always
attack
someone
front
Moody
might
for
don
think
let
you
choose
what
you
wanted
turned
into
though
said
Hermione
seriously
think
your
best
chance
some
sort
charm
Harry
thinking
that
would
soon
have
had
enough
the
library
last
him
lifetime
buried
himself
once
more
among
the
dusty
volumes
looking
for
any
spell
that
might
enable
human
survive
without
oxygen
However
though
Ron
and
Hermione
searched
through
their
lunchtimes
evenings
and
whole
weekends
though
Harry
asked
Professor
McGonagall
for
note
permission
use
the
Restricted
Section
and
even
asked
the
irritable
vulture
like
librarian
Madam
Pince
for
help
they
found
nothing
whatsoever
that
would
enable
Harry
spend
hour
underwater
and
live
tell
the
tale
Familiar
flutterings
panic
were
starting
disturb
Harry
now
and
was
finding
difficult
concentrate
class
again
The
lake
which
Harry
had
always
taken
for
granted
just
another
feature
the
grounds
drew
his
eyes
whenever
was
near
classroom
window
great
iron
gray
mass
chilly
water
whose
dark
and
icy
depths
were
starting
seem
distant
the
moon
Just
had
before
faced
the
Horntail
time
was
slipping
away
though
somebody
had
bewitched
the
clocks
extra
fast
There
was
week
before
February
the
twenty
fourth
there
was
still
time
there
were
five
days
was
bound
find
something
soon
three
days
please
let
find
something
please
With
two
days
left
Harry
started
off
food
again
The
only
good
thing
about
breakfast
Monday
was
the
return
the
brown
owl
had
sent
Sirius
pulled
off
the
parchment
unrolled
and
saw
the
shortest
letter
Sirius
had
ever
written
him
Send
date
next
Hogsmeade
weekend
return
owl
Harry
turned
the
parchment
over
and
looked
the
back
hoping
see
something
else
but
was
blank
Weekend
after
next
whispered
Hermione
who
had
read
the
note
over
Harrys
shoulder
Here
take
quill
and
send
this
owl
back
straight
away
Harry
scribbled
the
dates
down
the
back
Sirius
letter
tied
onto
the
brown
owl
leg
and
watched
take
flight
again
What
had
expected
Advice
how
survive
underwater
had
been
intent
telling
Sirius
all
about
Snape
and
Moody
had
completely
forgotten
mention
the
eggs
clue
What
want
know
about
the
next
Hogsmeade
weekend
for
said
Ron
Dunno
said
Harry
dully
The
momentary
happiness
that
had
flared
inside
him
the
sight
the
owl
had
died
Come
Care
Magical
Creatures
Whether
Hagrid
was
trying
make
for
the
Blast
Ended
Skrewts
because
there
were
now
only
two
skrewts
left
because
was
trying
prove
could
anything
that
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
could
Harry
didnt
know
but
Hagrid
had
been
continuing
her
lessons
unicorns
ever
since
returned
work
turned
out
that
Hagrid
knew
quite
much
about
unicorns
did
about
monsters
though
was
clear
that
found
their
lack
poisonous
fangs
disappointing
Today
had
managed
capture
two
unicorn
foals
Unlike
full
grown
unicorns
they
were
pure
gold
Parvati
and
Lavender
went
into
transports
delight
the
sight
them
and
even
Pansy
Parkinson
had
work
hard
conceal
how
much
she
liked
them
Easier
ter
spot
than
the
adults
Hagrid
told
the
class
They

silver
when

two
years
old

Don

white
till

Harry
Hagrid
muttered
moving
aside
slightly
while
most
the
others
swarmed
around
the
baby
unicorns
Yeah
said
Harry
Jus
nervous
said
Hagrid
Bit
said
Harry
Harry
said
Hagrid
clapping
massive
hand
his
shoulder
that
Harry
knees
buckled
under
its
weight
bin
worried
before
saw

Yeh

Harry
nodded
but
even
did
insane
urge
confess
that
didn
have
any
idea
how
survive
the
bottom
the
lake
for
hour
came
over
him
looked
Hagrid
perhaps
had
into
the
lake
sometimes
deal
with
the
creatures
looked
after
everything
else
the
grounds
after
all
Yeh
goin
ter

Hagrid
growled
patting
Harrys
shoulder
again
that
Harry
actually
felt
himself
sink
couple
inches
into
the
soft
ground
know
can
feel
Yeh
goin
ter
win
Harry
Harry
just
couldn
bring
himself
wipe
the
happy
confident
smile
off
Hagrid
face
Pretending
was
interested
the
young
unicorns
forced
smile
return
and
moved
forward
pat
them
with
the
others
the
evening
before
the
second
task
Harry
felt
though
were
trapped
nightmare
was
fully
aware
that
even
some
miracle
managed
find
suitable
spell
have
real
job
mastering
overnight
How
could
have
let
this
happen
Why
hadn
got
work
the
egg
clue
sooner
Why
had
ever
let
his
mind
wander
class
what
teacher
had
once
mentioned
how
breathe
underwater
sat
with
Hermione
and
Ron
the
library
the
sun
set
outside
tearing
feverishly
through
page
after
page
spells
hidden
from
one
another
the
massive
piles
books
the
desk
front
each
them
Harry
heart
gave
huge
leap
every
time
saw
the
word
water
page
but
more
often
than
not
was
merely
Take
two
pints
water
half
pound
shredded
mandrake
leaves
and
newt
don
reckon
can
done
said
Rons
voice
flatly
from
the
other
side
the
table
There
nothing
Nothing
Closest
was
that
thing
dry
puddles
and
ponds
that
Drought
Charm
but
that
was
nowhere
near
powerful
enough
drain
the
lake
There
must
something
Hermione
muttered
moving
candle
closer
her
Her
eyes
were
tired
she
was
poring
over
the
tiny

Was

Staggering
under

Harry
returned

Crookshanks
crawled
into
Harrys
lap
and
curled
purring
deeply
The
common
room
emptied
slowly
around
Harry
People
kept
wishing
him
luck
for
the
next
morning
cheery
confident
voices
like
Hagrid
all
them
apparently
convinced
that
was
about
pull
off
another
stunning
performance
like
the

Harry
couldn
answer

the

the

Forgetting
that
Crookshanks

Harry
stood
very
suddenly
Crookshanks
hissed
angrily
landed
the
floor
gave
Harry
disgusted
look
and
stalked
away
with
his
bottlebrush
tail
the
air
but
Harry
was
already
hurrying
the
spiral
staircase
his

would
grab
the
Invisibility

Harry

them
over

set

the
narrow

his

occasionally
checking
his

One
the

the

the
only
way
could
keep

was

The

the

laughing
Harry
was
bobbing
like
cork
bubbly
water
next
her
rock
while
she
held
his
Firebolt
over
his
head
Come

she
giggled
maliciously
Come

Harry
panted
snatching
the
Firebolt
and
struggling
not
sink
Give
But
she
just
poked
him
painfully
the
side
with
the
end
the
broomstick
laughing
him
That

off
ouch
Harry
Potter

Stop

Harry
opened

still
the

Invisibility
Cloak
had
slipped
off
his
head
slept
and
the
side
his
face
was
stuck

Where

Harry

Dobby
The

Harry

Ten

Harry
croaked
Ten

minutes
looked
down
his
watch
Dobby

twenty
past
nine
large
dead

seemed
fall
through
Harry
chest
into
his
stomach
Hurry

Dobby
plucking
Harry
sleeve

Dobby

the
elf
Dobby
knew
Harry
had
not
found

Dobby
did
for
him
What

Harry
But

gasped
They

The

squeaked
Dobby
But
past
hour
the
prospect
black
Harry
recited
staring
horror
struck
the
elf
Too
late
gone
won
come
back
Dobby
what

You

sir
queaked
the
elf
and
put
his
hand
the
pocket
his
shorts
and
drew
out
ball
what
looked
like
slimy
grayish
green
rat
tails
Right
before
you
into
the
lake
sir
gillyweed
What
said
Harry
staring
the
gillyweed
will
make
Harry
Potter
breathe
underwater
sir
Dobby
said
Harry
frantically
listen
are
you
sure
about
this
couldn
quite
forget
that
the
last
time
Dobby
had
tried
help
him
had
ended
with
bones
his
right
arm
Dobby
quite
sure
sir
said
the
elf
earnestly
Dobby
hears

sir
house
elf

all
over
the
castle
lights
the
fires
and
mops
the
floors
Dobby
heard
Professor
McGonagall
and
Professor
Moody
the
staffroom
talking
about
the
next
task
Dobby
cannot
let
Harry
Potter
lose
his
Wheezy
Harrys
doubts
vanished
Jumping
his
feet
pulled
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
stuffed
into
his
bag
grabbed
the
gillyweed
and
put
into
his
pocket
then
tore
out
the
library
with
Dobby
his
heels
Dobby
supposed
the
kitchens
sir
Dobby
squealed
they
burst
into
the
corridor
Dobby
will
missed
good
luck
Harry
Potter
sir
good
luck
See
you
later
Dobby
Harry
shouted
and
sprinted
along
the
corridor
and
down
the
stairs
three
time
The
entrance
hall
contained
few
last
minute
stragglers
all
leaving
the
Great
Hall
after
breakfast
and
heading
through
the
double
oak
doors
watch
the
second
task
They
stared
Harry
flashed
past
sending
Colin
and
Dennis
Creevey
flying
leapt
down
the
stone
steps
and
out
onto
the
bright
chilly
grounds
pounded
down
the
lawn
saw
that
the
seats
that
had
encircled
the
dragons
enclosure
November
were
now
ranged
along
the
opposite
bank
rising
stands
that
were
packed
the
bursting
point
and
reflected
the
lake
below
The
excited
babble
the
crowd
echoed
strangely
across
the
water
Harry
ran
flat
out
around
the
other
side
the
lake
toward
the
judges
who
were
sitting
another
gold
draped
table
the
water
edge
Cedric
Fleur
and
Krum
were
beside
the
judges
table
watching
Harry
sprint
toward
them
here
Harry
panted
skidding
halt
the
mud
and
accidentally
splattering
Fleurs
robes
Where
have
you
been
said
bossy
disapproving
voice
The
task
about
start
Harry
looked
around
Percy
Weasley
was
sitting
the
judges
table
Crouch
had
failed
turn
again
Now
now
Percy
said
Ludo
Bagman
who
was
looking
intensely
relieved
see
Harry
Let
him
catch
his
breath
Dumbledore
smiled
Harry
but
Karkaroff
and
Madame
Maxime
didn
look
all
pleased
see
him
was
obvious
from
the
looks
their
faces
that
they
had
thought
wasn
going
turn
Harry
bent
over
hands
his
knees
gasping
for
breath
had
stitch
his
side
that
felt
though
had
knife
between
his
ribs
but
there
was
time
get
rid
Ludo
Bagman
was
now
moving
among
the
champions
spacing
them
along
the
bank
intervals
ten
feet
Harry
was
the
very
end
the
line
next
Krum
who
was
wearing
swimming
trunks
and
was
holding
his
wand
ready
All
right
Harry
Bagman
whispered
moved
Harry
few
feet
farther
away
from
Krum
Know
what
you
going
Yeah
Harry
panted
massaging
his
ribs
Bagman
gave
Harry
shoulder
quick
squeeze
and
returned
the
judges
table
pointed
his
wand
his
throat
had
done
the
World
Cup
said
Sonorus
and
his
voice
boomed
out
across
the
dark
water
toward
the
stands
Well
all
our
champions
are
ready
for
the
second
task
which
will
start
whistle
They
have
precisely
hour
recover
what
has
been
taken
from
them
the
count
three
then
One
two
three
The
whistle
echoed
shrilly
the
cold
still
air
the
stands
erupted
with
cheers
and
applause
without
looking
see
what
the
other
champions
were
doing
Harry
pulled
off
his
shoes
and
socks
pulled
the
handful
gillyweed
out
his
pocket
stuffed
into
his
mouth
and
waded
out
into
the
lake
was
cold
felt
the
skin
his
legs
searing
though
this
were
fire
not
icy
water
His
sodden
robes
weighed
him
down
walked
deeper
now
the
water
was
over
his
knees
and
his
rapidly
numbing
feet
were
slipping
over
silt
and
flat
slimy
stones
was
chewing
the
gillyweed
hard
and
fast
could
felt
unpleasantly
slimy
and
rubbery
like
octopus
tentacles
Waist
deep
the
freezing
water
stopped
swallowed
and
waited
for
something
happen
could
hear
laughter
the
crowd
and
knew
must
look
stupid
walking
into
the
lake
without
showing
any
sign
magical
power
The
part
him
that
was
still
dry
was
covered
goose
pimples
half
immersed
the
icy
water
cruel
breeze
lifting
his
hair
Harry
started
shiver
violently
avoided
looking
the
stands
the
laughter
was
becoming
louder
and
there
were
catcalls
and
jeering
from
the
Slytherins
Then
quite
suddenly
Harry
felt
though
invisible
pillow
had
been
pressed
over
his
mouth
and
nose
tried
draw
breath
but
made
his
head
spin
his
lungs
were
empty
and
suddenly
felt
piercing
pain
either
side
his
neck
Harry
clapped
his
hands
around
his
throat
and
felt
two
large
slits
just
below
his
ears
flapping
the
cold
air
had
gills
Without
pausing
think
did
the
only
thing
that
made
sense
flung
himself
forward
into
the
water
The
first
gulp
icy
lake
water
felt
like
the
breath
life
His
head
had
stopped
spinning
took
another
great
gulp
water
and
felt
pass
smoothly
through
his
gills
sending
oxygen
back
his
brain
stretched
out
his
hands
front
him
and
stared
them
They
looked
green
and
ghostly
under
the
water
and
they
had
become
webbed
twisted
around
and
looked
his
bare
feet
they
had
become
elongated
and
the
toes
were
webbed
too
looked
though
had
sprouted
flippers
The
water
didn
feel
icy
anymore
either
the
contrary
felt
pleasantly
cool
and
very
light
Harry
struck
out
once
more
marveling
how
far
and
fast
his
flipper
like
feet
propelled
him
through
the
vater
and
noticing
how
clearly
could
see
and
how
longer
seemed
need
blink
had
soon
swum
far
into
the
lake
that
could
longer
see
the
bottom
flipped
over
and
dived
into
its
depths
Silence
pressed
upon
his
ears
soared
over
strange
dark
foggy
landscape
could
only
see
ten
feet
around
him
that
sped
throuugh
the
water
new
scenes
seemed
loom
suddenly
out
the
incoming
darkness
forests
rippling
tangled
black
weed
wide
plains
mud
littered
with
dull
glimmering
stones
swam
deeper
and
deeper
out
toward
the
middle
the
lake
his
eyes
wide
staring
through
the
eerily
gray
lit
water
around
him
the
shadow
beyond
where
the
water
became
opaque
Small
fish
flickered
past
him
like
silver
darts
Once
twice
thought
saw
something
larger
moving
ahead
him
but
when
got
nearer
discovered
nothing
but
large
blackened
log
dense
clump
weed
There
was
sign
any
the
other
champions
merpeople
Ron
nor
thankfully
the
giant
squid
Light
green
weed
stretched
ahead
him
far
could
see
two
feet
deep
like
meadow
very
overgrown
grass
Harry
was
staring
unblinkingly
ahead
him
trying
discern
shapes
through
the
gloom
and
then
without
warning
something
grabbed
hold
his
ankle
Harry
twisted
his
body
around
and
saw
grindylow
small
horned
water
demon
poking
out
the
weed
its
long
fingers
clutched
tightly
around
Harry
leg
its
pointed
fangs
bared
Harry
stuck
his
webbed
hand
quickly
inside
his
robes
and
fumbled
for
his
wand
the
time
had
grasped
two
more
grindylows
had
risen
out
the
weed
had
seized
handfuls
Harry
robes
and
were
attempting
drag
him
down
Relashio
Harry
shouted
except
that
sound
came
out
large
bubble
issued
from
his
mouth
and
his
wand
instead
sending
sparks
the
grindylows
pelted
them
with
what
seemed
jet
boiling
water
for
where
struck
them
angry
red
patches
appeared
their
green
skin
Harry
pulled
his
ankle
out
the
grindylows
grip
and
swam
fast
could
occasionally
sending
more
jets
hot
water
over
his
shoulder
random
every
now
and
then
felt
one
the
grindylows
snatch
his
foot
again
and
kicked
out
hard
finally
felt
his
foot
connect
with
horned
skull
and
looking
back
saw
the
dazed
grindylow
floating
away
cross
eyed
while
its
fellows
shook
their
fists
Harry
and
sank
back
into
the
weed
Harry
slowed
down
little
slipped
his
wand
back
inside
his
robes
and
looked
around
listening
again
turned
full
circle
the
water
the
silence
pressing
harder
than
ever
against
his
eardrums
knew
must
even
deeper
the
lake
now
but
nothing
was
moving
but
the
rippling
weed
How
are
you
getting
Harry
thought
was
having
heart
attack
whipped
around
and
saw
Moaning
Myrtle
floating
hazily
front
him
gazing
him
through
her
thick
pearly
glasses
Myrtle
Harry
tried
shout
but
once
again
nothing
came
out
his
mouth
but
very
large
bubble
Moaning
Myrtle
actually
giggled
You
want
try
over
there
she
said
pointing
won
come
with
you
don
like
them
much
they
always
chase
when
get
too
close
Harry
gave
her
the
thumbs
show
his
thanks
and
set
off
once
more
careful
swim
bit
higher
over
the
weed
avoid
any
more
grindylows
that
might
lurking
there
swam
for
what
felt
like
least
twenty
minutes
was
passing
over
vast
expanses
black
mud
now
which
swirled
murkily
disturbed
the
water
Then
long
last
heard
snatch
haunting
mersong
hour
long
you
have
look
And
recover
what
took
Harry
swam
faster
and
soon
saw
large
rock
emerge
out
the
muddy
water
ahead
had
paintings
merpeople
they
were
carrying
spears
and
chasing
what
looked
like
the
giant
squid
Harry
swam
past
the
rock
following
the
mersong
your
time
half
gone
tarry
not
Lest
what
you
seek
stays
here
rot
cluster
crude
stone
dwellings
stained
with
algae
loomed
suddenly
out
the
gloom
all
sides
Here
and
there
the
dark
windows
Harry
saw
faces
faces
that
bore
resemblance
all
the
painting
the
mermaid
the
prefects
bathroom
The
merpeople
had
grayish
skin
and
long
wild
dark
green
hair
Their
eyes
were
yellow
were
their
broken
teeth
and
they
wore
thick
ropes
pebbles
around
their
necks
They
leered
Harry
swam
past
one
two
them
emerged
from
their
caves
watch
him
better
their
powerful
silver
fish
tails
beating
the
water
spears
clutched
their
hands
Harry
sped
staring
around
and
soon
the
dwellings
became
more
numerous
there
were
gardens
weed
around
some
them
and
even
saw
pet
grindylow
tied
stake
outside
one
door
Merpeople
were
emerging
all
sides
now
watching
him
eagerly
pointing
his
webbed
hands
and
gills
talking
behind
their
hands
one
another
Harry
sped
around
corner
and
very
strange
sight
met
his
eyes
whole
crowd
merpeople
was
floating
front
the
houses
that
lined
what
looked
like
mer
version
village
square
choir
merpeople
was
singing
the
middle
calling
the
champions
toward
them
and
behind
them
rose
crude
sort
statue
gigantic
merperson
hewn
from
boulder
Four
people
were
bound
tightly
the
tail
the
stone
merperson
Ron
was
tied
between
Hermione
and
Cho
Chang
There
was
also
girl
who
looked
older
than
eight
whose
clouds
silvery
hair
made
Harry
feel
sure
that
she
was
Fleur
Delacour
sister
All
four
them
appeared
very
deep
sleep
Their
heads
were
lolling
onto
their
shoulders
and
fine
streams
bubbles
kept
issuing
from
their
mouths
Harry
sped
toward
the
hostages
half
expecting
the
merpeople
lower
their
spears
and
charge
him
but
they
did
nothing
The
ropes
weed
tying
the
hostages
the
statue
were
thick
slimy
and
very
strong
For
fleeting
second
thought
the
knife
Sirius
had
bought
him
for
Christmas
locked
his
trunk
the
castle
quarter
mile
away
use
him
whatsoever
looked
around
Many
the
merpeople
surrounding
them
were
carrying
spears
swam
swiftly
toward
seven
foot
tall
merman
with
long
green
beard
and
choker
shark
fangs
and
tried
mime
request
borrow
the
spear
The
merman
laughed
and
shook
his
head
not
help
said
harsh
croaky
voice
Come
Harry
said
fiercely
but
only
bubbles
issued
from
his
mouth
and
tried
pull
the
spear
away
from
the
merman
but
the
merman
yanked
back
still
shaking
his
head
and
laughing
Harry
swirled
around
staring
about
Something
sharp
anything
There
were
rocks
littering
the
lake
bottom
dived
and
snatched
particularly
jagged
one
and
returned
the
statue
began
hack
the
ropes
binding
Ron
and
after
several
minutes
hard
work
they
broke
apart
Ron
floated
unconscious
few
inches
above
the
lake
bottom
drifting
little
the
ebb
the
water
Harry
looked
around
There
was
sign
any
the
other
champions
What
were
they
playing
Why
didn
they
hurry
turned
back
Hermione
raised
the
jagged
rock
and
began
hack
her
bindings
too
once
several
pairs
strong
gray
hands
seized
him
Half
dozen
mermen
were
pulling
him
away
from
Hermione
shaking
their
green
haired
heads
and
laughing
You
take
your
own
hostage
one
them
said
him
Leave
the
others
way
said
Harry
furiously
but
only
two
large
bubbles
came
out
Your
task
retrieve
your
own
friend
leave
the
others
She
friend
too
Harry
yelled
gesturing
toward
Hermione
enormous
silver
bubble
emerging
soundlessly
from
his
lips
And
don
want
them
die
either
Cho
head
was
Hermiones
shoulder
the
small
silver
haired
girl
was
ghostly
green
and
pale
Harry
struggled
fight
off
the
mermen
but
they
laughed
harder
than
ever
holding
him
back
Harry
looked
wildly
around
Where
were
the
other
champions
Would
have
time
take
Ron
the
surface
and
come
back
down
for
Hermione
and
the
others
Would
able
find
them
again
looked
down
his
watch
see
how
much
time
was
left
had
stopped
working
But
then
the
merpeople
around
him
pointed
excitedly
over
his
head
Harry
looked
and
saw
Cedric
swimming
toward
them
There
was
enormous
bubble
around
his
head
which
made
his
features
look
oddly
wide
and
stretched
Got
lost
mouthed
looking
panic
stricken
Fleur
and
Krum
coming
now
Feeling
enormously
relieved
Harry
watched
Cedric
pull
knife
out
his
pocket
and
cut
Cho
free
pulled
her
upward
and
out
sight
Harry
looked
around
waiting
Where
were
Fleur
and
Krum
Time
was
getting
short
and
according
the
song
the
hostages
would
lost
after
hour
The
merpeople
started
screeching
animatedly
Those
holding
Harry
loosened
their
grip
staring
behind
them
Harry
turned
and
saw
something
monstrous
cutting
through
the
water
toward
them
human
body
swimming
trunks
with
the
head
shark
was
Krum
appeared
have
transfigured
himself
but
badly
The
shark
man
swam
straight
Hermione
and
began
snapping
and
biting
her
ropes
the
trouble
was
that
Krum
new
teeth
were
positioned
very
awkwardly
for
biting
anything
smaller
than
dolphin
and
Harry
was
quite
sure
that
Krum
wasn
careful
was
going
rip
Hermione
half
Darting
forward
Harry
hit
Krum
hard
the
shoulder
and
held
the
jagged
stone
Krum
seized
and
began
cut
Hermione
free
Within
seconds
had
done
grabbed
Hermione
around
the
waist
and
without
backward
glance
began
rise
rapidly
with
her
toward
the
surface
Now
what
Harry
thought
desperately
could
sure
that
Fleur
was
coming
But
still
sign
There
was
nothing
done
except
snatched
the
stone
which
Krum
had
dropped
but
the
mermen
now
closed
around
Ron
and
the
little
girl
shaking
their
heads
him
Harry
pulled
out
his
wand
Get
out
the
way
Only
bubbles
flew
out
his
mouth
but
had
the
distinct
impression
that
the
mermen
had
understood
him
because
they
suddenly
stopped
laughing
Their
yellowish
eyes
were
fixed
upon
Harry
wand
and
they
looked
scared
There
might
lot
more
them
than
there
were
him
but
Harry
could
tell
the
looks
their
faces
that
they
knew
more
magic
than
the
giant
squid
did
You
got
until
three
Harry
shouted
great
stream
bubbles
burst
from
him
but
held
three
fingers
make
sure
they
got
the
message
One
put
down
finger
two
put
down
second
one
They
scattered
Harry
darted
forward
and
began
hack
the
ropes
binding
the
small
girl
the
statue
and
last
she
was
free
seized
the
little
girl
around
the
waist
grabbed
the
neck
Rons
robes
and
kicked
off
from
the
bottom
was
very
slow
work
could
longer
use
his
webbed
hands
propel
himself
forward
worked
his
flippers
furiously
but
Ron
and
Fleur
sister
were
like
potato
filled
sacks
dragging
him
back
down
fixed
his
eyes
skyward
though
knew
must
still
very
deep
the
water
above
him
was
dark
Merpeople
were
rising
with
him
could
see
them
swirling
around
him
with
ease
watching
him
struggle
through
the
water
Would
they
pull
him
back
down
the
depths
when
the
time
was
Did
they
perhaps
eat
humans
Harry
legs
were
seizing
with
the
effort
keep
swimming
his
shoulders
were
aching
horribly
with
the
effort
dragging
Ron
and
the
girl
was
drawing
breath
with
extreme
difficulty
could
feel
pain
the
sides
his
neck
again
was
becoming
very
aware
how
wet
the
water
was
his
mouth
yet
the
darkness
was
definitely
thinning
now
could
see
daylight
above
him
kicked
hard
with
his
flippers
and
discovered
that
they
were
nothing
more
than
feet
water
was
flooding
through
his
mouth
into
his
lungs
was
starting
feel
dizzy
but
knew
light
and
air
were
only
ten
feet
above
him
had
get
there
had
Harry
kicked
his
legs
hard
and
fast
felt
though
his
muscles
were
screaming
protest
his
very
brain
felt
waterlogged
couldn
breathe
needed
oxygen
had
keep
going
could
not
stop
And
then
felt
his
head
break
the
surface
the
lake
wonderful
cold
clear
air
was
making
his
wet
face
sting
gulped
down
feeling
though
had
never
breathed
properly
before
and
panting
pulled
Ron
and
the
little
girl
with
him
All
around
him
wild
green
haired
heads
were
emerging
out
the
water
with
him
but
they
were
smiling
him
The
crowd
the
stands
was
making
great
deal
noise
shouting
and
screaming
they
all
seemed
their
feet
Harry
had
the
impression
they
thought
that
Ron
and
the
little
girl
might
dead
but
they
were
wrong
both
them
had
opened
their
eyes
the
girl
looked
scared
and
confused
but
Ron
merely
expelled
great
spout
water
blinked
the
bright
light
turned
Harry
and
said
Wet
this
isn
Then
spotted
Fleur
sister
What
did
you
bring
her
for
Fleur
didn
turn
couldn
leave
her
Harry
panted
Harry
you
prat
said
Ron
you
didn
take
that
song
thing
seriously
did
you
Dumbledore
wouldn
have
let
any
drown
The
song
said
was
only
make
sure
you
got
back
inside
the
time
limit
said
Ron
hope
you
didn
waste
time
down
there
acting
the
hero
Harry
felt
both
stupid
and
annoyed
was
all
very
well
for
Ron
been
asleep
hadn
felt
how
eerie
was
down
the
lake
surrounded
spear
carrying
merpeople
who
looked
more
than
capable
murder
mon
Harry
said
shortly
help
with
her
don
think
she
can
swim
very
well
They
pulled
Fleur
sister
through
the
water
back
toward
the
bank
where
the
judges
stood
watching
twenty
merpeople
accompanying
them
like
guard
honor
singing
their
horrible
screechy
songs
Harry
could
see
Madam
Pomfrey
fussing
over
Hermione
Krum
Cedric
and
Cho
all
whom
were
wrapped
thick
blankets
Dumbledore
and
Ludo
Bagman
stood
beaming
Harry
and
Ron
from
the
bank
they
swam
nearer
but
Percy
who
looked
very
white
and
somehow
much
younger
than
usual
came
splashing
out
meet
them
Meanwhile
Madame
Maxime
was
trying
restrain
Fleur
Delacour
who
was
quite
hysterical
fighting
tooth
and
nail
return
the
water
Gabrielle
Gabrielle
she
alive
she
urt
She
fine
Harry
tried
tell
her
but
was
exhausted
could
hardly
talk
let
alone
shout
Percy
seized
Ron
and
was
dragging
him
back
the
bank
Gerroff
Percy
all
right
Dumbledore
and
Bagman
were
pulling
Harry
upright
Fleur
had
broken
free
Madame
Maxime
and
was
hugging
her
sister
was
grindylows
zey
attacked
Gabrielle
thought
thought
Come
here
you
said
Madam
Pomfrey
She
seized
Harry
and
pulled
him
over
Hermione
and
the
others
wrapped
him
tightly
blanket
that
felt
though
were
straitjacket
and
forced
measure
very
hot
potion
down
his
throat
Steam
gushed
out
his
ears
Harry
well
done
Hermione
cried
You
did
you
found
out
how
all
yourself
Well
said
Harry
would
have
told
her
about
Dobby
but
had
just
noticed
Karkaroff
watching
him
was
the
only
judge
who
had
not
left
the
table
the
only
judge
not
showing
signs
pleasure
and
relief
that
Harry
Ron
and
Fleur
sister
had
got
back
safely
Yeah
that
right
said
Harry
raising
his
voice
slightly
that
Karkaroff
could
hear
him
You
haff
water
beetle
your
hair
Herm
own
ninny
said
Krum
Harry
had
the
impression
that
Krum
was
drawing
her
attention
back
onto
himself
perhaps
remind
her
that
had
just
rescued
her
from
the
lake
but
Hermione
brushed
away
the
beetle
impatiently
and
said
You
well
outside
the
time
limit
though
Harry
Did
take
you
ages
find
found
you
okay
Harry
feeling
stupidity
was
growing
Now
was
out
the
water
seemed
perfectly
clear
that
Dumbledores
safety
precautions
wouldn
have
permitted
the
death
hostage
just
because
their
champion
hadn
turned
Why
hadn
just
grabbed
Ron
and
gone
would
have
been
first
back
Cedric
and
Krum
hadn
wasted
time
worrying
about
anyone
else
they
hadn
taken
the
mersong
seriously
Dumbledore
was
crouching
the
water
edge
deep
conversation
with
what
seemed
the
chief
merperson
particularly
wild
and
ferocious
looking
female
was
making
the
same
sort
screechy
noises
that
the
merpeople
made
when
they
were
above
water
clearly
Dumbledore
could
speak
Mermish
Finally
straightened
turned
his
fellow
judges
and
said
conference
before
give
the
marks
think
The
judges
went
into
huddle
Madam
Pomfrey
had
gone
rescue
Ron
from
Percy
clutches
she
led
him
over
Harry
and
the
others
gave
him
blanket
and
some
Pepperup
Potion
then
went
fetch
Fleur
and
her
sister
Fleur
had
many
cuts
her
face
and
arms
and
her
robes
were
torn
but
she
didn
seem
care
nor
would
she
allow
Madam
Pomfrey
clean
them
Look
after
Gabrielle
she
told
her
and
then
she
turned
Harry
You
saved
she
said
breathlessly
Even
though
she
was
not
your
ostage
Yeah
said
Harry
who
was
now
heartily
wishing
left
all
three
girls
tied
the
statue
Fleur
bent
down
kissed
Harry
twice
each
cheek
felt
his
face
burn
and
wouldn
have
been
surprised
steam
was
coming
out
his
ears
again
then
said
Ron
And
you
too
you
elped
Yeah
said
Ron
looking
extremely
hopeful
yeah
bit
Fleur
swooped
down
him
too
and
kissed
him
Hermione
looked
simply
furious
but
just
then
Ludo
Bagman
magically
magnified
voice
boomed
out
beside
them
making
them
all
jump
and
causing
the
crowd
the
stands
very
quiet
Ladies
and
gentlemen
have
reached
our
decision
Merchieftainess
Murcus
has
told
exactly
what
happened

bottom
the
lake
and
have
therefore
decided
award
marks
out
fifty
for
each
the
champions
follows
Fleur
Delacour
though
she
demonstrated
excellent
use
the
Bubble
Head
Charm
was
attacked
grindylows
she
approached
her
goal
and
failed
retrieve
her
hostage
award
her
twenty
five
points
Applause
from
the
stands

said
Fleur
throatily
shaking
her
magnificent
head
Cedric
Diggory
who
also
used
the
Bubble
Head
Charm
was
first
return
with
his
hostage
though
returned
one
minute
outside
the
time
limit
hour
Enormous
cheers
from
the
Hufflepuffs
the
crowd
Harry
saw
Cho
give
Cedric
glowing
look
therefore
award
him
forty
seven
points
Harrys
heart
sank
Cedric
had
been
outside
the
time
limit
most
certainly
had
been
Viktor
Krum
used
incomplete
form
Transfiguration
which
was
nevertheless
effective
and
was
second
return
with
his
hostage
award
him
forty
points
Karkaroff
clapped
particularly
hard
looking
very
superior
Harry
Potter
used
gillyweed
great
effect
Bagman
continued
returned
last
and
well
outside
the
time
limit
hour
However
the
Merchieftainess
informs
that
Potter
was
first
reach
the
hostages
and
that
the
delay
his
return
was
due
his
determination
return
all
hostages
safety
not
merely
his
own
Ron
and
Hermione
both
gave
Harry
half
exasperated
half
commiserating
looks
Most
the
judges
and
here
Bagman
gave
Karkaroff
very
nasty
look
feel
that
this
shows
moral
fiber
and
merits
full
marks
However
Potter
score
forty
five
points
Harry
stomach
leapt
was
now
tying
for
first
place
with
Cedric
Ron
and
Hermione
caught
surprise
stared
Harry
then
laughed
and
started
applauding
hard
with
the
rest
the
crowd
There
you
Harry
Ron
shouted
over
the
noise
You
weren
being
thick
after
all
you
were
showing
moral
fiber
Fleur
was
clapping
very
hard
too
but
Krum
didn
look
happy
all
attempted
engage
Hermione
conversation
again
but
she
was
too
busy
cheering
Harry
listen
The
third
and
final
task
will
take
place
dusk
the
twenty
fourth
June
continued
Bagman
The
champions

notified
what

precisely
one
month
beforehand
Thank
you
all
for
your
support
the
champions
was
over
Harry
thought
dazedly
Madam
Pomfrey
began
herding
the
champions
and
hostages
back
the
castle
get
into
dry
clothes
was
over
had
got
through
didn
have
worry
about

until
June
the
twenty
fourth
Next
time
was
Hogsmeade
Harry
decided
walked
back
the
stone
steps
into
the
castle
was
going
buy
Dobby
pair
socks
for
every
day
the
year
CHAPTER
TWENTY
SEVEN
PADFOOT
RETURNS
One
the
best
things
about
the
aftermath
the
second
task
was
that
everybody
was
very
keen
hear
details
what
had
happened
down
the
lake
which
meant
that
Ron
was
getting
share
Harry
limelight
for
once
Harry
noticed
that
Ron
version
events
changed
subtly
with
every
retelling
first
gave
what
seemed
the
truth
tallied
with
Hermione
story
anyway
Dumbledore
had
put
all
the
hostages
into
bewitched
sleep
Professor
McGonagall
office
first
assuring
them
that
they
would
quite
safe
and
would
awake
when
they
were
back
above
the
water
One
week
later
however
Ron
was
telling
thrilling
tale
kidnap
which
struggled
single
handedly
against
fifty
heavily
armed
merpeople
who
had
beat
him
into
submission
before
tying
him
But
had
wand
hidden
sleeve
assured
Padma
Patil
who
seemed
lot
keener
Ron
now
that
was
getting
much
attention
and
was
making
point
talking
him
every
time
they
passed
the
corridors
could
taken
those
mer
idiots
any
time
wanted
What
were
you
going
snore
them
said
Hermione
waspishly
People
had
been
teasing
her
much
about
being
the
thing
that
Viktor
Krum
would
most
miss
that
she
was
rather
tetchy
mood
Ron
ears
went
red
and
thereafter
reverted
the
bewitched
sleep
version
events
they
entered
March
the
weather
became
drier
but
cruel
winds
skinned
their
hands
and
faces
every
time
they
went
out
onto
the
grounds
There
were
delays
the
post
because
the
owls
kept
being
blown
off
course
The
brown
owl
that
Harry
had
sent
Sirius
with
the
dates
the
Hogsmeade
weekend
turned
breakfast
Friday
morning
with
half
its
feathers
sticking
the
wrong
way
Harry
had
sooner
torn
off
Sirius
reply
than
took
flight
clearly
afraid
was
going
sent
outside
again
Sirius

Hermione

said
Harry
tensely
caught
Made
far
though

Ron
And
not
like
the
place
swarming
with
dementors
anymore
Harry
folded
the
letter
thinking
was
honest
with
himself
really
wanted
see
Sirius
again
therefore
approached
the
final
lesson
the
afternoon
double
Potions
feeling
considerably
more
cheerful
than
usually
did
when
descending
the
steps
the
dungeons
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
standing
huddle
outside
the
classroom
door
with
Pansy
Parkinson
gang
Slytherin
girls
All
them
were
looking
something
Harry
couldn
see
and
sniggering
heartily
Pansys
pug
like
face
peered
excitedly
around
Goyle
broad
back
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
approached
There
they
are
there
they
are
she
giggled
and
the
knot
Slytherins
broke
apart
Harry
saw
that
Pansy
had
magazine
her
hands
Witch
Weekly
The
moving
picture
the
front
showed
curly
haired
witch
who
was
smiling
toothily
and
pointing
large
sponge
cake
with
her
wand
You
might
find
something
interest
you
there
Granger
Pansy
said
loudly
and
she
threw
the
magazine
Hermione
who
caught
looking
startled
that
moment
the
dungeon
door
opened
and
Snape
beckoned
them
all
inside
Hermione
Harry
and
Ron
headed
for
table
the
back
the
dungeon
usual
Once
Snape
had
turned

Hermione
hastily
rifled
through

Hermione
found

were

and
Ron
leaned

his

Hermione

Little
did
know
that

shortly
suffering

another
emotional
blow
life
already
littered
with
personal

Miss
Granger
plain
but
ambitious
girl
seems
have
taste
for
famous
wizards
that
Harry
alone
cannot
satisfy
Since
the
arrival
Hogwarts
Viktor
Krum
Bulgarian
Seeker
and
hero
the
last
World
Quidditch
Cup
Miss
Granger
has
been
toying
with
both

Krum
who
openly
smitten
with
the
devious
Miss
Granger
has
already
invited
her
visit
him
Bulgaria
over
the
summer
holidays
and
insists
that
has
never
felt
this
way
about
any
other
girl
However
might
not
Miss
Granger
doubtful

charms
that
have
captured

She
really
ugly
says
Pansy
Parkinson
pretty
and
vivacious
fourth

but
she
well
making
Love
Potion
she
quite
brainy
think
that
how
she
doing
Love
Potions
are
course
banned
Hogwarts
and
doubt
Albus
Dumbledore
will
want
investigate
these
claims
the
meantime
Harry
Potters
well
wishers
must
hope
that
next
time
bestows
his
heart
worthier
candidate
told
you
Ron
hissed
Hermione
she
stared
down
the
article
told
you
not
annoy
Rita
Skeeter
She
made
you
out
some
sort
scarlet
woman
Hermione
stopped
looking
astonished
and
snorted
with
laughter
Scarlet
woman
she
repeated
shaking
with
suppressed
giggles
she
looked
around
Ron
what
mum
calls
them
Ron
muttered
his
ears
going
red
that
the
best
Rita
can
she
losing
her
touch
said
Hermione
still
giggling
she
threw
Witch
Weekly
onto
the
empty
chair
beside
her
What
pile
old
rubbish
She
looked
over
the
Slytherins
who
were
all
watching
her
and
Harry
closely
across
the
room
see
they
had
been
upset
the
article
Hermione
gave
them
sarcastic
smile
and
wave
and
she
Harry
and
Ron
started
unpacking
the
ingredients
they
would
need
for
their
Wit
Sharpening
Potion
There
something
funny
though
said
Hermione
ten
minutes
later
holding
her
pestle
suspended
over
bowl
scarab
beetles
How
could
Rita
Skeeter
have
known
Known
what
said
Ron
quickly
You
haven
been
mixing
Love
Potions
have
you
Don
stupid
Hermione
snapped
starting
pound
her
beetles
again
just
how
did
she
know
Viktor
asked
visit
him
over
the
summer
Hermione
blushed
scarlet
she
said
this
and
determinedly
avoided
Ron
eyes
What
said
Ron
dropping
his
pestle
with
loud
clunk
asked
right
after
pulled
out
the
lake
Hermione
muttered
After
got
rid
his
shark
head
Madam
Pomfrey
gave
both
blankets
and
then
sort
pulled
away
from
the
judges
they
wouldn
hear
and
said
wasn
doing
anything
over
the
summer
would
like
And
what
did
you
say
said
Ron
who
had
picked
his
pestle
and
was
grinding
the
desk
good
six
inches
from
his
bowl
because
was
looking
Hermione
And
did
say
never
felt
the
same
way
about
anyone
else
Hermione
went
going
red
now
that
Harry
could
almost
feel
the
heat
coming
from
her
but
how
could
Rita
Skeeter
have
heard
him
She
wasn
there
was
she
Maybe
she
has
got
Invisibility
Cloak
maybe
she
sneaked
onto
the
grounds
watch
the
second
task
And
what
did
you
say
Ron
repeated
pounding
his
pestle
down
hard
that
dented
the
desk
Well
was
too
busy
seeing
whether
you
and
Harry
were
okay
Fascinating
though
your
social
life
undoubtedly
Miss
Granger
said
icy
voice
right
behind
them
and
all
three
them
jumped
must
ask
you
not
discuss
class
Ten
points
from
Gryffindor
Snape
had
glided
over
their
desk
while
they
were
talking
The
whole
class
was
now
looking
around
them
Malfoy
took
the
opportunity
flash
POTTER
STINKS
across
the
dungeon
Harry
reading
magazines
under
the
table
well
Snape
added
snatching
the
copy
Witch
Weekly
further
ten
points
from
Gryffindor
but
course
Snapes
black
eyes
glittered
they
fell
Rita
Skeeter
article
Potter
has
keep
with
his
press
cuttings
The
dungeon
rang
with
the
Slytherins
laughter
and
unpleasant
smile
curled
Snape
thin
mouth
Harry
fury
began
read
the
article
aloud
Harry
Potter
Secret
Heartache
dear
dear
Potter
what
ailing
you
now
boy
like
other
perhaps
Harry
could
feel
his
face
burning
Snape
was
pausing
the
end
every
sentence
allow
the
Slytherins
hearty
laugh
The
article
sounded
ten
times
worse
when
read
Snape
Even
Hermione
was
blushing
scarlet
now
Harry
Potter
well
wishers
must
hope
that
next
time
bestows
his
heart
upon
worthier
candidate
How
very
touching
sneered
Snape
rolling
the
magazine
continued
gales
laughter
from
the
Slytherins
Well
think
had
better
separate
the
three
you
you
can
keep
your
minds
your
potions
rather
than
your
tangled
love
lives
Weasley
you
stay
here
Miss
Granger
over
there
beside
Miss
Parkinson
Potter
that
table
front
desk
Move
Now
Furious
Harry
threw
his
ingredients
and
his
bag
into
his
cauldron
and
dragged
the
front
the
dungeon
the
empty
table
Snape
followed
sat
down
his
desk
and
watched
Harry
unload
his
cauldron
Determined
not
look
Snape
Harry
resumed
the
mashing
his
scarab
beetles
imagining
each
one
have
Snape
face
All
this
press
attention
seems
have
inflated
your
already
over
large
head
Potter
said
Snape
quietly
once
the
rest
the
class
had
settled
down
again
Harry
didn
answer
knew
Snape
was
trying
provoke
him
had
done
this
before
doubt
was
hoping
for
excuse
take
round
fifty
points
from
Gryffindor
before
the
end
the
class
You
might
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
the
entire
wizarding
world
impressed
with
you
Snape
went
quietly
that
one
else
could
hear
him
Harry
continued
pound
his
scarab
beetles
even
though
had
already
reduced
them
very
fine
powder
but
don
care
how
many
times
your
picture
appears
the
papers
Potter
you
are
nothing
but
nasty
little
boy
who
considers
rules
beneath
him
Harry
tipped
the
powdered
beetles
into
his
cauldron
and
started
cutting
his
ginger
roots
His
hands
were
shaking
slightly
out
anger
but
kept
his
eyes
down
though
couldn
hear
what
Snape
was
saying
him
give
you
fair
warning
Potter
Snape
continued
sorter
and
more
dangerous
voice
pint
sized
celebrity
not
catch
you
breaking
into
office
one
more
time
haven
been
anywhere
near
your
office
said
Harry
angrily
forgetting
his
feigned
deafness
Don
lie
Snape
hissed
his
fathomless
black
eyes
boring
into
Harrys
Boomslang
skin
Gillyweed
Both
come
from
private
stores
and
know
who
stole
them
Harry
stared
back
Snape
determined
not
blink
look
guilty
truth
hadn
stolen
either
these
things
from
Snape
Hermione
had
taken
the
boomslang
skin
back
their
second
year
they
had
needed
for
the
Polyjuice
Potion
and
while
Snape
had
suspected
Harry
the
time
had
never
been
able
prove
Dobby
course
had
stolen
the
gillyweed
don
know
what
you
talking
about
Harry
lied
coldly
You
were
out
bed
the
night
office
was
broken
into
Snape
hissed
know
Potter
Now
Mad
Eye
Moody
might
have
joined
your
fan
club
but
will
not
tolerate
your
behavior
One
more
nighttime
stroll
into
office
Potter
and
you
will
pay
Right
said
Harry
coolly
turning
back
his
ginger
roots
bear
that
mind
ever
get
the
urge
there
Snape
eyes
flashed
plunged
hand
into
the
inside
his
black
robes
For
one
wild
moment
Harry
thought
Snape
was
about
pull
out
his
wand
and
curse
him
then
saw
that
Snape
had
drawn
out
small
crystal
bottle
completely
clear
potion
Harry
stared
you
know
what
this
Potter
Snape
said
his
eyes
glittering
dangerously
again
said
Harry
with
complete
honesty
this
time
Veritaserum
Truth
Potion
powerful
that
three
drops
would
have
you
spilling
your
innermost
secrets
for
this
entire
class
hear
said
Snape
viciously
Now
the
use
this
potion
controlled
very
strict
Ministry
guidelines
But
unless
you
watch
your
step
you
might
just
find
that
hand
slips
shook
the
crystal
bottle
slightly
right
over
your
evening
pumpkin
juice
And
then
Potter
then
find
out
whether
you
been
office
not
Harry
said
nothing
turned
back
his
ginger
roots
once
more
picked
his
knife
and
started
slicing
them
again
didn
like
the
sound
that
Truth
Potion
all
nor
would
put
past
Snape
slip
him
some
repressed
shudder
the
thought
what
might
come
spilling
out
his
mouth
Snape
did
quite
apart
from
landing
whole
lot
people
trouble
Hermione
and
Dobby
for
start
there
were
all
the
other
things
was
concealing
like
the
fact
that
was
contact
with
Sirius
and
his
insides
squirmed
the
thought
how
felt
about
Cho
tipped
his
ginger
roots
into
the
cauldron
too
and
wondered
whether
ought
take
leaf
out
Moody
book
and
start
drinking
only
from
private
hip
flask
There
was
knock
the
dungeon
door
Enter
said
Snape
his
usual
voice
The
class
looked
around
the
door
opened
Professor
Karkaroff
came
Everyone
watched
him
walked
toward
Snape
desk
was
twisting
his
finger
around
his
goatee
and
looking
agitated
need
talk
said
Karkaroff
abruptly
when
had
reached
Snape
seemed
determined
that
nobody
should
hear
what
was
saying
that
was
barely
opening
his
lips
was
though
were
rather
poor
ventriloquist
Harry
kept
his
eyes
his
ginger
roots
listening
hard
talk
you
after
lesson
Karkaroff
Snape
muttered
but
Karkaroff
interrupted
him
want
talk
now
while
you
can
slip
off
Severus
You
been
avoiding
After
the
lesson
Snape
snapped
Under
the
pretext
holding
measuring
cup
see
poured
out
enough
armadillo
bile
Harry
sneaked
sidelong
glance
the
pair
them
Karkaroff
looked
extremely
worried
and
Snape
looked
angry
Karkaroff
hovered
behind
Snape
desk
for
the
rest
the
double
period
seemed
intent
preventing
Snape
from
slipping
away
the
end
class
Keen
hear
what
Karkaroff
wanted
say
Harry
deliberately
knocked
over
his
bottle
armadillo
bile
with
two
minutes
the
bell
which
gave
him
excuse
duck
down
behind
his
cauldron
and
mop
while
the
rest
the
class
moved
noisily
toward
the
door
What
urgent
heard
Snape
hiss
Karkaroff
This
said
Karkaroff
and
Harry
peering
around
the
edge
his
cauldron
saw
Karkaroff
pull
the
left
hand
sleeve
his
robe
and
show
Snape
something
his
inner
forearm
Well
said
Karkaroff
still
making
every
effort
not
move
his
lips
you
see
never
been
this
clear
never
since
Put
away
snarled
Snape
his
black
eyes
sweeping
the
classroom
But
you
must
have
noticed
Karkaroff
began
agitated
voice
can
talk
later
Karkaroff
spat
Snape
Potter
What
are
you
doing
Clearing
armadillo
bile
Professor
said
Harry
innocently
straightening
and
showing
Snape
the
sodden
rag
was
holding
Karkaroff
turned
his
heel
and
strode
out
the
dungeon
looked
both
worried
and
angry
Not
wanting
remain
alone
with
exceptionally
angry
Snape
Harry
threw
his
books
and
ingredients
back
into
his
bag
and
left
top
speed
tell
Ron
and
Hermione
what
had
just
witnessed
They
left
the
castle
noon
the
next
day
find
weak
silver
sun
shining
down
upon
the
grounds
The
weather
was
milder
than
had
been
all
year
and
the
time
they
arrived
Hogsmeade
all
three
them
had
taken
off
their
cloaks
and
thrown
them
over
their
shoulders
The
food
Sirius
had
told
them
bring
was
Harry
bag
they
had
sneaked
dozen
chicken
legs
loaf
bread
and
flask
pumpkin
juice
from
the
lunch
table
They
went
into
Gladrags
Wizardwear
buy
present
for
Dobby
where
they
had
fun
selecting
the
most
lurid
socks
they
could
find
including
pair
patterned
with
flashing
gold
and
silver
stars
and
another
that
screamed
loudly
when
they
became
too
smelly
Then
half
past
one
they
made
their
way
the
High
Street
past
Dervish
and
Banges
and
out
toward
the
edge
the
village
Harry
had
never
been
this
direction
before
The
winding
lane
was
leading
them
out
into
the
wild
countryside
around
Hogsmeade
The
cottages
were
fewer
here
and
their
gardens
larger
they
were
walking
toward
the
foot
the
mountain
whose
shadow
Hogsmeade
lay
Then
they
turned
corner
and
saw
stile
the
end
the
lane
Waiting
for
them
its
front
paws
the
topmost
bar
was
very
large
shaggy
black
dog
which
was
carrying
some
newspapers
its
mouth
and
looking
very
familiar
Hello
Sirius
said
Harry
when
they
had
reached
him
The
black
dog
sniffed
Harry
bag
eagerly
wagged
its
tail
once
then
turned
and
began
trot
away
from
them
across
the
scrubby
patch
ground
that
rose
meet
the
rocky
foot
the
mountain
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
climbed
over
the
stile
and
followed
Sirius
led
them
the
very
foot
the
mountain
where
the
ground
was
covered
with
boulders
and
rocks
was
easy
for
him
with
his
four
paws
but
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
soon
out
breath
They
followed
Sirius
higher
onto
the
mountain
itself
For
nearly
half
hour
they
climbed
steep
winding
and
stony
path
following
Sirius
wagging
tail
sweating
the
sun
the
shoulder
straps
Harry
bag
cutting
into
his
shoulders
Then
last
Sirius
slipped
out
sight
and
when
they
reached
the
place
where
had
vanished
they
saw
narrow
fissure
the
rock
They
squeezed
into
and
found
themselves
cool
dimly
lit
cave
Tethered
the
end
one
end
his
rope
around
large
rock
was
Buckbeak
the
hippogriff
Half
gray
horse
half
giant
eagle
Buckbeak
fierce
orange
eye
flashed
the
sight
them
All
three
them
bowed
low
him
and
after
regarding
them
imperiously
for
moment
Buckbeak
bent
his
scaly
front
knees
and
allowed
Hermione
rush
forward
and
stroke
his
feathery
neck
Harry
however
was
looking
the
black
dog
which
had
just
turned
into
his
godfather
Sirius
was
wearing
ragged
gray
robes
the
same
ones
had
been
wearing
when
had
left
Azkaban
His
black
hair
was
longer
than
had
been
when
had
appeared
the
fire
and
was
untidy
and
matted
once
more
looked
very
thin
Chicken
said
hoarsely
after
removing
the
old
Daily
Prophets
from
his
mouth
and
throwing
them
down
onto
the
cave
floor
Harry
pulled
open
his
bag
and
handed
over
the
bundle
chicken
legs
and
bread
Thanks
said
Sirius
opening
grabbing
drumstick
sitting
down
the
cave
floor
and
tearing
off
large
chunk
with
his
teeth
been
living
off
rats
mostly
Can
steal
too
much
food
from
Hogsmeade
draw
attention
myself
grinned
Harry
but
Harry
returned
the
grin
only
reluctantly
What
you
doing
here
Sirius
said
Fulfilling
duty
godfather
said
Sirius
gnawing
the
chicken
bone
very
doglike
way
Don
worry
about
pretending
lovable
stray
was
still
grinning
but
seeing
the
anxiety
Harrys
face
said
more
seriously
want
the
spot
Your
last
letter
well
let
just
say
things
are
getting
fishier
been
stealing
the
paper
every
time
someone
throws
one
out
and
the
looks
things
not
the
only
one
who
getting
worried
nodded
the
yellowing
Daily
Prophets
the
cave
floor
and
Ron
picked
them
and
unfolded
them
Harry
however
continued
stare
Sirius
What
they
catch

look
Sirius
however
looked
interested
Crouch

his
house
elf
Yeah

Quidditch
World
Cup
said
Harry
and
launched
into
the
story
the
Dark
Mark
appearance
and
Winky
being
found
with
Harrys
wand
clutched
her
hand
and
Crouch
fury
When
Harry
had
finished
Sirius
was
his
feet
again
and
had
started
pacing
and
down
the
cave
Let
get
this
straight
said
after
while
brandishing
fresh
chicken
leg
You
first
saw
the
elfin
the
Top
Box
She
was
saving
Crouch
seat
right
Right
said
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
together
But
Crouch
didn
turn
for
the
match
said
Harry
think
said
been
too
busy
Sirius
paced
all
around
the
cave
silence
Then
said
Harry
did
you
check
your
pockets
for
your
wand
after
you
left
the
Top
Box
Erm
Harry
thought
hard
said
finally
didn
need
use
before
got
the
forest
And
then
put
hand
pocket
and
all
that
was
there
were
Omnioculars
stared
Sirius
Are
you
saying
whoever
conjured
the
Mark
stole
wand
the
Top
Box
possible
said
Sirius
Winky
didn
steal
that
wand
Hermione
insisted
The
elf
wasn
the
only
one
that
box
said
Sirius
his
brow
furrowed
continued
pace
Who
else
was
sitting
behind
you
Loads
people
said
Harry
Some
Bulgarian
ministers
Cornelius
Fudge
the
Malfoys
The
Malfoys
said
Ron
suddenly
loudly
that
his
voice
echoed
all
around
the
cave
and
Buckbeak
tossed
his
head
nervously
bet
was
Lucius
Malfoy
Anyone
else
said
Sirius
one
said
Harry
Yes
there
was
there
was
Ludo
Bagman
Hermione
reminded
him
yeah
don
know
anything
about
Bagman
except
that
used
Beater
for
the
Wimbourne
Wasps
said
Sirius
still
pacing
What
like
okay
said
Harry
keeps
offering
help
with
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Does
now
said
Sirius
frowning
more
deeply
wonder
why
that
Says
taken
liking
said
Harry
Hmm
said
Sirius
looking
thoughtful
saw
him
the
forest
just
before
the
Dark
Mark
appeared
Hermione
told
Sirius
Remember
she
said
Harry
and
Ron
Yeah
but
didn
stay
the
forest
did
said
Ron
The
moment
told
him
about
the
riot
went
off
the
campsite
How
you
know
Hermione
shot
back
How
you
know
where
Disapparated
Come
off
said
Ron
incredulously
Are
you
saying
you
reckon
Ludo
Bagman
conjured
the
Dark
Mark
more
likely
did
than
Winky
said
Hermione
stubbornly
Told
you
said
Ron
looking
meaningfully
Sirius
told
you
she
obsessed
with
house
But
Sirius
held
hand
silence
Ron
When
the
Dark
Mark
had
been
conjured
and
the
elf
had
been
discovered
holding
Harry
wand
what
did
Crouch
Went
look
the
bushes
said
Harry
but
there
wasn
anyone
else
there
course
Sirius
muttered
pacing
and
down
course
want
pin
anyone
but
his
own
elf
and
then
sacked
her
Yes
said
Hermione
heated
voice
sacked
her
just
because
she
hadn
stayed
her
tent
and
let
herself
get
trampled
Hermione
will
you
give
rest
with
the
elf
said
Ron
Sirius
shook
his
head
and
said
She
got
the
measure
Crouch
better
than
you
have
Ron
you
want
know
what
mans
like
take
good
look
how
treats
his
inferiors
not
his
equals
ran
hand
over
his
unshaven
face
evidently
thinking
hard
All
these
absences
Barty
Crouch
goes
the
trouble
making
sure
his
house
elf
saves
him
seat
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
but
doesn
bother
turn
and
watch
works
very
hard
reinstate
the
Triwizard
Tournament
and
then
stops
coming
that
too
not
like
Crouch
ever
taken
day
off
work
because
illness
before
this
eat
Buckbeak
you
know
Crouch
then
said
Harry
Sirius
face
darkened
suddenly
looked
menacing
had
the
night
when
Harry
first
met
him
the
night
when
Harry
still
believed
Sirius
murderer
know
Crouch
all
right
said
quietly
was
the
one
who
gave
the
order
for

Azkaban
without

What

You

Harry
Ron
and
Hermione

for
the
next
Minister
Magic
said
Sirius
great
wizard
Barty
Crouch
powerfully
magical
and
power
hungry
never
Voldemort
supporter
said
reading
the
look
Harrys
face
Barty
Crouch
was
always
very
outspoken
against
the
Dark
Side
But
then
lot
people
who
were
against
the
Dark
Side
well
you
wouldn
understand
you
too
young
That
what
dad
said
the
World
Cup
said
Ron
with
trace
irritation
his
voice
Try
why
don
you
grin
flashed
across
Sirius
thin
face
All
right
try
you
walked
once
the
cave
back
again
and
then
said
Imagine
that
Voldemort
powerful
now
You
don
know
who
his
supporters
are
you
don
know
who
working
for
him
and
who
isn
you

control
people

they
terrible
things
without
being
able

themselves
You
scared
for

Every

more

Ministry

they
don

what
they
trying

everything

meanwhile
Muggles

Terror
everywhere

Well
times

and
the
worst
others
Crouch
principles
might
been
good
the
beginning
wouldn
know
rose
quickly
through
the
Ministry
and
started
ordering
very
harsh
measures
against
Voldemorts
supporters
The
Aurors
were
given
new
powers
powers
kill
rather
than
capture
for
instance
And
wasn
the
only
one
who
was
handed
straight
the
dementors
without
trial
Crouch
fought
violence
with
violence
and
authorized
the
use
the
Unforgivable
Curses
against
suspects
would
say
became
ruthless
and
cruel
many
the
Dark
Side
had
his
supporters
mind
you
plenty
people
thought
was
going
about
things
the
right
way
and
there
were
lot
witches
and
wizards
clamoring
for
him
take
over
Minister
Magic
When
Voldemort
disappeared
looked
like
only
matter
time
until
Crouch
got
the
top
job
But
then
something
rather
unfortunate
happened
Sirius
smiled
grimly
Crouch
own
son
was
caught
with
group
Death
Eaters
who
managed
talk
their
way
out
Azkaban
Apparently
they
were
trying
find
Voldemort
and
return
him
power
Crouch
son
was
caught
gasped
Hermione
Yep
said
Sirius
throwing
his
chicken
bone
Buckbeak
flinging
himself
back
down
the
ground
beside
the
loaf
bread
and
tearing
half
Nasty
little
shock
for
old
Barty
imagine
Should
have
spent
bit
more
time
home
with
his
family
shouldn
Ought
have
left
the
office
early
once
while
gotten
know
his
own
son
began
wolf
down
large
pieces
bread
Was
his
son
Death
Eater
said
Harry
idea
said
Sirius
still
stuffing
down
bread
was
Azkaban
myself
when
was
brought
This
mostly
stuff
found
out
since
got
out
The
boy
was
definitely
caught
the
company
people
bet
life
were
Death
Eaters
but
might
have
been
the
wrong
place
the
wrong
time
just
like
the
house
elf
Did
Crouch
try
and
get
his
son
off
Hermione
whispered
Sirius
let
out
laugh
that
was
much
more
like
bark
Crouch
let
his
son
off
thought
you
had
the
measure
him
Hermione
Anything
that
threatened
tarnish
his
reputation
had
had
dedicated
his
whole
life
becoming
Minister
Magic
You
saw
him
dismiss
devoted
house
elf
because
she
associated
him
with
the
Dark
Mark
again
doesn
that
tell
you
what
like
Crouch
fatherly
affection
stretched
just
far
enough
give
his
son
trial
and
all
accounts
wasn
much
more
than
excuse
for
Crouch
show
how
much
hated
the
boy
then
sent
him
straight
Azkaban
gave
his
own
son
the
dementors
asked
Harry
quietly
That
right
said
Sirius
and
didn
look
remotely
amused
now
saw
the
dementors
bringing
him
watched
them
through
the
bars
cell
door
can
have
been
more
than
nineteen
They
took
him
into
cell
near
mine
was
screaming
for
his
mother
nightfall
went
quiet
after
few
days
though
they
all
went
quiet
the
end
except
when
they
shrieked
their
sleep
For
moment
the
deadened
look
Sirius
eyes
became
more
pronounced
than
ever
though
shutters
had
closed
behind
them
still
Azkaban
Harry
said
said
Sirius
dully
not
there
anymore
died
about
year
after
they
brought
him
died
wasn
the
only
one
said
Sirius
bitterly
Most
mad
there
and
plenty
stop
eating
the
end
They
lose
the
will
live
You
could
always
tell
when
death
was
coming
because
the
dementors
could
sense
they
got
excited
That
boy
looked
pretty
sickly
when
arrived
Crouch
being
important
Ministry
member
and
his
wife
were
allowed
deathbed
visit
That
was
the
last
time
saw
Barty
Crouch
half
carrying
his
wife
past
cell
She
died
herself
apparently
shortly
afterward
Grief
Wasted
away
just
like
the
boy
Crouch
never
came
for
his
sons
body
The
dementors
buried
him
outside
the
fortress
watched
them
Sirius
threw
aside
the
bread
had
just
lifted
his
mouth
and
instead
picked
the
flask
pumpkin
juice
and
drained
old
Crouch
lost
all
just
when
thought
had
made
continued
wiping
his
mouth
with
the
back
his
hand
One
moment
hero
poised
become
Minister
Magic
next
his
son
dead
his
wife
dead
the
family
name
dishonored
and
heard
since
escaped
big
drop
popularity
Once
the
boy
had
died
people
started
feeling
bit
more
sympathetic
toward
the
son
and
started
asking
how
nice
young
lad
from
good
family
had
gone
badly
astray
The
conclusion
was
that
his
father
never
cared
much
for
him
Cornelius
Fudge
got
the
top
job
and
Crouch
was
shunted
sideways
into
the
Department
International
Magical
Cooperation
There
was
long
silence
Harry
was
thinking
the
way
Crouch
eyes
had
bulged
looked
down
his
disobedient
house
elf
back
the
wood
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
This
then
must
have
been
why
Crouch
had
overreacted
Winky
being
found
beneath
the
Dark
Mark
had
brought
back
memories
his
son
and
the
old
scandal
and
his
fall
from
grace
the
Ministry
Moody
says
Crouch
obsessed
with
catching
Dark
wizards
Harry
told
Sirius
Yeah
heard
become
bit
mania
with
him
said
Sirius
nodding
you
ask
still
thinks
can
bring
back
the
old
popularity
catching
one
more
Death
Eater
And
sneaked
here
search
Snape
office
aid
Ron
triumphantly
looking
Hermione
Yes
and
that
doesn
make
sense
all
said
Sirius
Yeah
does
said
Ron
excitedly
but
Sirius
shook
his
head
Listen
Crouch
wants
investigate
Snape
why
hasn
been
coming
judge
the
tournament
would
ideal
excuse
make
regular
visits
Hogwarts
and
keep
eye
him
you
think
Snape
could
something
then
asked
Harry
but
Hermione
broke
Look
don
care
what
you
say
Dumbledore
trusts
Snape
give
rest
Hermione
said
Ron
impatiently
know
Dumbledores
brilliant
and
everything
but
that
doesn
mean
really
clever
Dark
wizard
couldn
fool
him
Why
did
Snape
save
Harry
life
the
first
year
then
Why
didn
just
let
him
die
dunno
maybe
thought
Dumbledore
would
kick
him
out
What
you
think
Sirius
Harry
said
loudly
and
Ron
and
Hermione
stopped
bickering
listen
think
they
both
got
point
said
Sirius
looking
thoughtfully
Ron
and
Hermione
Ever
since
found
out
Snape
was
teaching
here
wondered
why
Dumbledore
hired
him
Snape
always
been
fascinated
the
Dark
Arts
was
famous
for
school
Slimy
oily
greasy
haired
kid
was
Sirius
added
and
Harry
and
Ron
grinned
each
other
Snape
knew
more
curses
when
arrived
school
than
half
the
kids
seventh
year
and
was
part
gang
Slytherins
who
nearly
all
turned
out
Death
Eaters
Sirius
held
his
fingers
and
began
ticking
off
names
Rosier
and
Wilkes
they
were
both
killed
Aurors
the
year
before
Voldemort
fell
The
Lestranges
they
married
couple
they
Azkaban
Avery
from
what
heard
wormed
his
way
out
trouble
saying
been
acting
under
the
Imperius
Curse
still
large
But
far
know
Snape
was
never
even
accused
being
Death
Eater
not
that
that
means
much
Plenty
them
were
never
caught
And
Snape
certainly
clever
and
cunning
enough
keep
himself
out
trouble
Snape
knows
Karkaroff
pretty
well
but
wants
keep
that
quiet
said
Ron
Yeah
you
should
seen
Snape
face
when
Karkaroff
turned
Potions
yesterday
said
Harry
quickly
Karkaroff
wanted
talk
Snape
says
Snape
been
avoiding
him
Karkaroff
looked
really
worried
showed
Snape
something
his
arm
but
couldn
see
what
was
showed
Snape
something
his
arm
said
Sirius
looking
frankly
bewildered
ran
his
fingers
distractedly
through
his
filthy
hair
then
shrugged
again
Well
idea
what
that
about
but
Karkaroff
genuinely
worried
and
going
Snape
for
answers
Sirius
stared
the
cave
wall
then
made
grimace
frustration
There
still
the
fact
that
Dumbledore
trusts
Snape
and
know
Dumbledore
trusts
where
lot
other
people
wouldn
but
just
can
see
him
letting
Snape
teach
Hogwarts
ever
worked
for
Voldemort
Why
are
Moody
and
Crouch
keen
get
into
Snapes
office
then
said
Ron
stubbornly
Well
said
Sirius
slowly
wouldn
put
past
Mad
Eye
have
searched
every
single
teacher
office
when
got
Hogwarts
takes
his
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
seriously
Moody
not
sure
trusts
anyone
all
and
after
the
things
seen
not
surprising
say
this
for
Moody
though
never
killed
could
help
Always
brought
people
alive
where
possible
was
tough
but
never
descended
the
level
the
Death
Eaters
Crouch
though
different
matter
really
ill
why
did
make
the
effort
drag
himself
Snape
office
And
not
what
What
was
doing
the
World
Cup
that
was
important
didn
turn
the
Top
Box
What
been
doing
while
should
have
been
judging
the
tournament
Sirius
lapsed
into
silence
still
staring
the
cave
wall
Buckbeak
was
ferreting
around
the
rocky
floor
looking
for
bones
might
have
overlooked
Finally
Sirius
looked
Ron
You
say
your
brother
Crouch
personal
assistant
Any
chance
you
could
ask
him
seen
Crouch
lately
can
try
said
Ron
doubtfully
Better
not
make
sound
like
reckon
Crouch
anything
dodgy
though
Percy
loves
Crouch
And
you
might
try
and
find
out
whether
they
got
any
leads
Bertha
Jorkins
while
you
said
Sirius
gesturing
the
second
copy
the
Daily
Prophet
Bagman
told
they
hadn
said
Harry
Yes
quoted
the
article
there
said
Sirius
nodding
the
paper
Blustering
about
how
bad
Bertha
memory
Well
maybe
she
changed
since
knew
her
but
the
Bertha
knew
wasn
forgetful
all
quite
the
reverse
She
was
bit
dim
but
she
had
excellent
memory
for
gossip
used
get
her
into
lot
trouble
she
never
knew
when
keep
her
mouth
shut
can
see
her
being
bit
liability
the
Ministry
Magic
maybe
that
why
Bagman
didn
bother
look
for
her
for
long
Sirius
heaved
enormous
sigh
and
rubbed
his
shadowed
eyes
What
the
time
Harry
checked
his
watch
then
remembered
hadn
been
working
since
had
spent
over
hour
the
lake
half
past
three
said
Hermione
You
better
get
back
school
Sirius
said
getting
his
feet
Now
listen
looked
particularly
hard
Harry
don
want
you
lot
sneaking
out
school
see
all
right
Just
send
notes
here
still
want
hear
about
anything
odd
But
you
not
leaving
Hogwarts
without
permission
would
ideal
opportunity
for
someone
attack
you
one
tried
attack
far
except
dragon
and
couple
grindylows
Harry
said
but
Sirius
scowled
him
don
care
breathe
freely
again
when
this
tournament
over
and
that
not
until
June
And
don
forget
you
talking
about
among
yourselves
call
Snuffles
okay
handed
Harry
the
empty
napkin
and
flask
and
went
pat
Buckbeak
good
bye
walk
the
edge
the
village
with
you
said
Sirius
see
can
scrounge
another
paper
transformed
into
the
great
black
dog
before
they
left
the
cave
and
they
walked
back
down
the
mountainside
with
him
across
the
boulder
strewn
ground
and
back
the
stile
Here
allowed
each
them

him
the
head
before

and
setting

run
around
the
outskirts
the
village
Harry

But

Yeah
Percy

They
walked
the
stone
steps
into
the
entrance
hall

from

Great
Hall
Poor

CHAPTER

THE
MADNESS
CROUCH
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
went
the
Owlery
after
breakfast
Sunday
send
letter
Percy
asking
Sirius
had
suggested
whether
had
seen
Crouch
lately
They
used
Hedwig
because
had
been
long
since
she
had
job
When
they
had
watched
her
fly
out
sight
through
the
Owlery
window
they
proceeded
down
the
kitchen
give
Dobby
his
new
socks
The
house
elves
gave
them
very
cheery
welcome
bowing
and
curtsying
and
bustling
around
making
tea
again
Dobby
was
ecstatic
about
his
present
Harry
Potter
too
good
Dobby
squeaked
wiping
large
tears
out
his
enormous
eyes
You
saved
life
with
that
gillyweed
Dobby
you
really

said
Harry
chance
more
those
eclairs
there
said
Ron
who
was
looking
around
the
beaming
and
bowing
house
elves
You
just
had
breakfast
said
Hermione
irritably
but
great
silver
platter
eclairs
was
already
zooming
toward
them
supported
four
elves

get
some
stuff
send
Snuffles
Harry
muttered
Good
idea
said
Ron
Give
Pig
something
You
couldn
give
bit
extra
food
could
you
said
the
surrounding
elves
and
they
bowed
delightedly
and
hurried
off
get
some
more
Dobby
where
Winky
said
Hermione
who
was
looking
around
Winky
over
there
the
fire
miss
said
Dobby
quietly
his
ears
drooping
slightly
dear
said
Hermione
she
spotted
Winky
Harry
looked
over
the
fireplace
too
Winky
was
sitting
the
same
stool
last
time
but
she
had
allowed
herself
become
filthy
that
she
was
not
immediately
distinguishable
from
the
smoke
blackened
brick
behind
her
Her
clothes
were
ragged
and
unwashed
She
was
clutching
bottle
butterbeer
and
swaying
slightly
her
stool
staring
into
the
fire
they
watched
her
she
gave
enormous
hiccup
Winky
getting
through
six
bottles
day
now
Dobby
whispered
Harry
Well
not
strong
that
stuff
Harry
said
But
Dobby
shook
his
head
Tis
strong
for
house
elf
sir
said
Winky
hiccuped
again
The
elves
who
had
brought
the
eclairs
gave
her
disapproving
looks
they
returned
work
Winky
pining
Harry
Potter
Dobby
whispered
sadly
Winky
wants
home
Winky
still
thinks
Crouch
her
master
sir
and
nothing
Dobby
says
will
persuade
her
that
Professor
Dumbledore
her
master
now
Hey
Winky
said
Harry
struck
sudden
inspiration
walking
over
her
and
bending
down
you
don
know
what
Crouch
might
you
Because
stopped
turning
judge
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Winky
eyes
flickered
Her
enormous
pupils
focused
Harry
She
swayed
slightly
again
and
then
said
Master
stopped
hic
coming
Yeah
said
Harry

seen
him
since
the
first
task
The
Daily
Prophet
saying
ill
Winky
swayed
some
more
staring
blurrily
Harry
Master
hic
ill
Her
bottom
lip
began
tremble
But
not
sure
that
true
said
Hermione
quickly
Master
needing
his
hie
Winky
whimpered
the
elf
Master

hic
manage
hic
all

Other
people

own
housework

Winky
Hermione
said
severely
Winky
hic
not
only
hic
doing
housework
for
Crouch
Winky
squeaked
indignantly
swaying
worse
than
ever
and
slopping
butterbeer
down
her
already
heavily
stained
blouse
Master
hic
trusting
Winky
with
hic
the
most
important
hic
the
most
secret
What
said
Harry
But
Winky
shook
her
head
very
hard
spilling
more
butterbeer
down
herself
Winky

hic
her
master
secrets
she
said
mutinously
swaying
very
heavily
now
frowning
Harry
with
her
eyes
crossed
You
hic
nosing

Winky
must
not
talk
like
that
Harry
Potter
said
Dobby
angrily
Harry
Potter

Winky

hic
Winky

her
silence
hic
people

hic
Winky
eyelids
drooped
and
suddenly
without
warning
she
slid
off
her
stool
into
the
hearth
snoring
loudly
The
empty
bottle
butterbeer
rolled
away
across
the
stone
flagged
floor
Half
dozen
house
elves
came
hurrying
forward
looking
disgusted
One
them
picked
the
bottle
the
others
covered
Winky
with
large
checked
tablecloth
and
tucked
the
ends
neatly
hiding
her
from
view
sorry
you
had
see
that
sirs
and
miss
squeaked
nearby
elf
shaking
his
head
and
looking
very
ashamed
hoping
you
will
not
judge
all
Winky
sirs
and
miss
She
unhappy
said
Hermione
exasperated
Why
don
you
try
and
cheer
her
instead
covering
her
Begging
your
pardon
miss
said
the
house
elf
bowing
deeply
again
but
house
elves
has
right
unhappy
when
there
work
done
and
masters
served
for
heavens
sake
Hermione
cried
Listen

You

right
wages
and
holidays
and
proper
clothes

Dobby
Miss

Dobby
out
this
Dobby
mumbled
looking
scared
The
cheery
smiles
had
vanished
from
the
faces
the
house
elves
around
the
kitchen
They
were
suddenly
looking
Hermione
though
she
were
mad
and
dangerous
has
your
extra
food
squeaked
elf
Harry
elbow
and
shoved
large
ham
dozen
cakes
and
some
fruit
into
Harry
arms
Good
bye
The
house
elves
crowded
around
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
and
began
shunting
them
out
the
kitchen
many
little
hands
pushing
the
smalls
their
backs
Thank
you
for
the
socks
Harry
Potter
Dobby
called
miserably
from
the
hearth
where
was
standing
next
the
lumpy
tablecloth
that
was
Winky
You
couldn
keep
your
mouth
shut
could
you
Hermione
said
Ron
angrily
the
kitchen
door
slammed
shut
behind
them
They
won
want
visiting
them
now
could
tried
get
more
stuff
out
Winky
about
Crouch
you
care
about
that
scoffed
Hermione
You
only
like
coming
down
here
for
the
food
was
irritable
sort
day
after
that
Harry
got
tired
Ron
and
Hermione
sniping
each
other
over
their
homework
the
common
room
that
took
Sirius
food
the
Owlery
that
evening
his
own
Pigwidgeon
was
much
too
small
carry
entire
ham
the
mountain
himself
Harry
enlisted
the
help
two
school
screech
owls
well
When
they
had
set
off
into
the
dusk
looking
extremely
odd
carrying
the
large
package
between
them
Harry
leaned
the
windowsill
looking
out
the
grounds
the
dark
rustling
treetops
the
Forbidden
Forest
and
the
rippling
sails
the
Durmstrang
ship
eagle
owl
flew
through
the
coil
smoke
rising
from
Hagrids
chimney
soared
toward
the
castle
around
the
Owlery
and
out
sight
Looking
down
Harry
saw
Hagrid
digging
energetically
front
his
cabin
Harry
wondered
what
was
doing
looked
though
were
making
new
vegetable
patch
watched
Madame
Maxime
emerged
from
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
and
walked
over
Hagrid
She
appeared
trying
engage
him
conversation
Hagrid
leaned
upon
his
spade
but
did
not
seem
keen
prolong
their
talk
because
Madame
Maxime
returned
the
carriage
shortly
afterward
Unwilling
back
Gryffindor
Tower
and
listen
Ron
and
Hermione
snarling
each
other
Harry
watched
Hagrid
digging
until
the
darkness
swallowed
him
and
the
owls
around
Harry
began
awake
swooshing
past
him
into
the
night
breakfast
the
next
day
Ron
and
Hermione
bad
moods
had
burnt
out
and
Harrys
relief
Ron
dark
predictions
that
the
house
elves
would
send
substandard
food
the
Gryffindor
table
because
Hermione
had
insulted
them
proved
false
the
bacon
eggs
and
kippers
were
quite
good
usual
When
the
post
owls
arrived
Hermione
looked
eagerly
she
seemed
expecting
something
Percy
won
had
time
answer
yet
said
Ron
only
sent
Hedwig
yesterday
not
that
said
Hermione
taken
out
subscription
the
Daily
Prophet
getting
sick
finding
everything
out
from
the
Slytherins
Good
thinking
said
Harry
also
looking
the
owls
Hey
Hermione
think
you
luck
gray
owl
was
soaring
down
toward
Hermione
hasn
got
newspaper
though
she
said
looking
disappointed
But
her
bewilderment
the
gray
owl
landed
front
her
plate
closely
followed
four
barn
owls
brown
owl
and
tawny
How
many
subscriptions
did
you
take
out
said
Harry
seizing
Hermione
goblet
before
was
knocked
over
the
cluster
owls
all
whom
were
jostling
close
her
trying
deliver
their
own
letter
first
What
earth
Hermione
said
taking
the
letter
from
the
gray
owl
opening
and
starting
read
really
she
sputtered
going
rather
red
What
said
Ron
how
ridiculous
She
thrust
the
letter
Harry
who
saw
that
was
not
handwritten
but
composed
from
pasted
letters
that
seemed
have
been
cut
out
the
Daily
Prophet
YOU
ARE
WICKED
GIRL
HARRY
POTTER
DESERVES
BETTER
BACK
WHERE

CAME

They

Hermione
desperately
opening

another

likes

You

boiled
frog
spawn
Ouch
She
had
opened
the
last
envelope
and
yellowish
green
liquid
smelling
strongly
petrol
gushed
over
her
hands
which
began
erupt
large
yellow
boils
Undiluted
bubotuber
pus
said
Ron
picking
the
envelope
gingerly
and
sniffing
said
Hermione
tears
starting
her
eyes
she
tried
rub
the
pus
off
her
hands
with
napkin
but
her
fingers
were
now
thickly
covered
painful
sores
that
looked
though
she
were
wearing
pair
thick
knobbly
gloves
You
better
get
the
hospital
wing
said
Harry
the
owls
around
Hermione
took
flight
tell
Professor
Sprout
where

gone
warned
her
said
Ron
Hermione
hurried
out
the
Great
Hall
cradling
her
hands
warned

Hagrid

ill
wishers
sent
Howlers
which
exploded
the
Gryffindor
table
and
shrieked
insults
her
for
the
whole
Hall
hear
Even
those
people
who
didn
read
Witch
Weekly
knew
all
about
the
supposed
Harry
Krum
Hermione
triangle
now
Harry
was
getting
sick
telling
people
that
Hermione
wasn
his
girlfriend
die
down
though
told
Hermione
just
ignore
People
got
bored
with
that
stuff
she
wrote
about
last
time
want
know
how
she
listening
into
private
conversations
when
she
supposed
banned
from
the
grounds
said
Hermione
angrily
Hermione
hung
back
their
next
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
ask
Professor
Moody
something
The
rest
the
class
was
very
eager
leave
Moody
had
given
them
such
rigorous
test
hex
deflection
that
many
them
were
nursing
small
injuries
Harry
had
such
bad
case
Twitchy
Ears
had
hold
his
hands
clamped
over
them
walked
away
from
the
class
Well
Rita
definitely
not
using
Invisibility
Cloak
Hermione
panted
five
minutes
later
catching
with
Harry
and
Ron
the
entrance
hall
and
pulling
Harrys
hand
away
from
one
his
wiggling
ears
that
could
hear
her
Moody
says
didn
see
her
anywhere
near
the
judges
table
the
second
task
anywhere
near
the
lake
Hermione
there
any
point
telling
you
drop
this
said
Ron
said
Hermione
stubbornly
want
know
how
she
heard
talking
Viktor
And
how
she
found
out
about
Hagrids
mum
Maybe
she
had
you
bugged
said
Harry
Bugged
said
Ron
blankly
What
put
fleas
her
something
Harry
started
explaining
about
hidden
microphones
and
recording
equipment
Ron
was
fascinated
but
Hermione
interrupted
them
Aren
you
two
ever
going
read
Hogwarts
History
What
the
point
said
Ron
You
know
heart
can
just
ask
you
All
those
substitutes
for
magic
Muggles
use
electricity
computers
and
radar
and
all
those
things
they
all
haywire
around
Hogwarts
there
too
much
magic
the
air
Rita
using
magic
eavesdrop
she
must
could
just
find
out
what
ooh
illegal
have
her
Haven
got
enough
worry
about
Ron
asked
her
have
start
vendetta
against
Rita
Skeeter
well
not
asking
you
help
Hermione
snapped
own
She
marched
back
the
marble
staircase
without
backward
glance
Harry
was
quite
sure
she
was
going
the
library
What
the
betting
she
comes
back
with
box
Hate
Rita
Skeeter
badges
said
Ron
Hermione
however
did
not
ask
Harry
and
Ron
help
her
pursue
vengeance
against
Rita
Skeeter
for
which
they
were
both
grateful
because
their
workload
was
mounting
ever
higher
the
days
before
the
Easter
holidays
Harry
frankly
marveled
the
fact
that
Hermione
could
research
magical
methods
eavesdropping
well
everything
else
they
had
was
working
flat
out
just
get
through
all
their
homework
though
made
point
sending
regular
food
packages
the
cave
the
mountain
for
Sirius
after
last
summer
Harry
had
not
forgotten
what
felt
like
continually
hungry
enclosed
notes
Sirius
telling
him
that
nothing
out
the
ordinary
had
happened
and
that
they
were
still
waiting
for
answer
from
Percy
Hedwig
didn
return
until
the
end
the
Easter
holidays
Percy
letter
was
enclosed
package
Easter
eggs
that
Mrs
Weasley
had
sent
Both
Harrys
and
Ron
were
the
size
dragon
eggs
and
full
homemade
toffee
Hermiones
however
was
smaller
than
chicken
egg
Her
face
fell
when
she
saw
Your
mum
doesn
read
Witch
Weekly
any
chance
does
she
Ron
she
asked
quietly
Yeah
said
Ron
whose
mouth
was
full
toffee
Gets
for
the
recipes
Hermione
looked
sadly
her
tiny
egg
Don
you
want
see
what
Percy
written
Harry
asked
her
hastily
Percys
letter
was
short
and
irritated
constantly
telling
the
Daily
Prophet
Crouch
taking
well
deserved
break
sending
regular
owls
with
instructions
haven
actually
seen
him
but
think
can
trusted
know
own
superior
handwriting
have
quite
enough
the
moment
without
trying
quash
these
ridiculous
rumors
Please
don
bother
again
unless
something
important
Happy
Easter
The
start
the
summer
term
would
normally
have
meant
that
Harry
was
training
hard
for
the
last
Quidditch
match
the
season
This
year
however
was
the
third
and
final
task
the
Triwizard
Tournament
for
which
needed
prepare
but
still
didn
know
what
would
have
Finally
the
last
week
May
Professor
McGonagall
held
him
back
Transfiguration
You
are
down
the
Quidditch
field
tonight
nine
clock
Potter
she
told
him
Bagman
will
there
tell
the
champions
about
the
third
task
half
past
eight
that
night
Harry
left
Ron
and
Hermione
Gryffindor
Tower
and
went
downstairs
crossed
the
entrance
hall
Cedric
came
from
the
Hufflepuff
common
room
What
you
reckon
going
asked
Harry
they
went
together
down
the
stone
steps
out
into
the
cloudy
night
Fleur
keeps
going
about
underground
tunnels
she
reckons
got
find
treasure
That
wouldn
too
bad
said
Harry
thinking
that
would
simply
ask
Hagrid
for
niffler
the
job
for
him
They
walked
down
the
dark
lawn
the
Quidditch
stadium
turned
through
gap
the
stands
and
walked
out
onto
the
field
What
they
done
Cedric
said
indignantly
stopping
dead
The
Quidditch
field
was
longer
smooth
and
flat
looked
though
somebody
had
been
building
long
low
walls
all
over
that
twisted
and
crisscrossed
every
direction
They
hedges
said
Harry
bending
examine
the
nearest
one
Hello
there
called
cheery
voice
Ludo
Bagman
was
standing
the
middle
the
field
with
Krum
and
Fleur
Harry
and
Cedric
made
their
way
toward
them
climbing
over
the
hedges
Fleur
beamed
Harry
came
nearer
Her
attitude
toward
him
had
changed
completely
since
had
saved
her
sister
from
the
lake
Well
what
you
think
said
Bagman
happily
Harry
and
Cedric
climbed
over
the
last
hedge
Growing
nicely
aren
they
Give
them
month
and
Hagrid
have
them
twenty
feet
high
Don
worry
added
grinning
spotting
the
less
than
happy
expressions
Harrys
and
Cedric
faces
you
have
your
Quidditch
field
back
normal
once
the
task
over
Now
imagine
you
can
guess
what
making
here
one
spoke
for
moment
Then
Maze
grunted
Krum
That
right
said
Bagman
maze
The
third
task
really
very
straightforward
The
Triwizard
Cup
will
placed
the
center
the
maze
The
first
champion
touch
will
receive
full
marks
seemply
ave
get
through
the
maze
said
Fleur
There
will
obstacles
said
Bagman
happily
bouncing
the
balls
his
feet
Hagrid
providing
number
creatures
then
there
will
spells
that
must
broken
all
that
sort
thing
you
know
Now
the
champions
who
are
leading
points
will
get
head
start
into
the
maze
Bagman
grinned
Harry
and
Cedric
Then
Krum
will
enter
then
Miss
Delacour
But
you
all
with
fighting
chance
depending
how
well
you
get
past
the
obstacles
Should
fun
Harry
who
knew
only
too
well
the
kind
creatures
that
Hagrid
was
likely
provide
for
event
like
this
thought
was
unlikely
any
fun
all
However
nodded
politely
like
the
other
champions
Very
well
you
haven
got
any
questions
back
the
castle
shall
bit
chilly
Bagman
hurried
alongside
Harry
they
began
wend
their
way
out
the
growing
maze
Harry
had
the
feeling
that
Bagman
was
going
start
offering
help
him
again
but
just
then
Krum
tapped
Harry
the
shoulder
Could
haff
vord
Yeah
all
right
said
Harry
slightly
surprised
Vill
you
valk
vith
Okay
said
Harry
curiously
Bagman
looked
slightly
perturbed
wait
for
you
Harry
shall
okay
Bagman
said
Harry
suppressing
smile
think
can
find
the
castle
own
thanks
Harry
and
Krum
left
the
stadium
together
but
Krum
did
not
set
course
for
the
Durmstrang
ship
Instead
walked
toward
the
forest
What
going
this
way
for
said
Harry
they
passed
Hagrid
cabin
and
the
illuminated
Beauxbatons
carriage
Don
vont
overheard
said
Krum
shortly
When
last
they
had
reached
quiet
stretch
ground
short
way
from
the
Beauxbatons
horses
paddock
Krum
stopped
the
shade
the
trees
and
turned
face
Harry
vant
know
said
glowering
vot
there
between
you
and
Hermy
own
ninny
Harry
who
from
Krum
secretive
manner
had
expected
something
much
more
serious
than
this
stared
Krum
amazement
Nothing
said
But
Krum
glowered
him
and
Harry
somehow
struck
anew
how
tall
Krum
was
elaborated
friends
She
not
girlfriend
and
she
never
has
been
just
that
Skeeter
woman
making
things
Hermy
own
ninny
talks
about
you
very
often
said
Krum
looking
suspiciously
Harry
Yeah
said
Harry
because
were
friends
couldn
quite
believe
was
having
this
conversation
with
Viktor
Krum
the
famous
International
Quidditch
player
was
though
the
eighteen
year
old
Krum
thought
Harry
was
equal
real
rival
You
haff
never
you
haff
not
said
Harry
very
firmly
Krum
looked
slightly
happier
stared
Harry
for
few
seconds
then
said
You
fly
very
veil
vos
votching
the
first
task
Thanks
said
Harry
grinning
broadly
and
suddenly
feeling
much
taller
himself
saw
you
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
The
Wronski
Feint
you
really
But
something
moved
behind
Krum
the
trees
and
Harry
who
had
some
experience
the
sort
thing
that
lurked
the
forest
instinctively
grabbed
Krum
arm
and
pulled
him
around
Vot
Harry
shook
his
head
staring
the
place
where
seen
movement
slipped
his
hand
inside
his
robes
reaching
for
his
wand
Suddenly
man
staggered
out
from
behind
tall
oak
For
moment
Harry
didn
recognize
him
then
realized
was
Crouch
looked
though
had
been
traveling
for
days
The
knees
his
robes
were
ripped
and
bloody
his
face
scratched
was
unshaven
and
gray
with
exhaustion
His
neat
hair
and
mustache
were
both
need
wash
and
trim
His
strange
appearance
however
was
nothing
the
way
was
behaving
Muttering
and
gesticulating
Crouch
appeared
talking
someone
that
alone
could
see
reminded
Harry
vividly
old
tramp
had
seen
once
when
out
shopping
with
the
Dursleys
That
man
too
had
been
conversing
wildly
with
thin
air
Aunt
Petunia
had
seized
Dudley
hand
and
pulled
him
across
the
road
avoid
him
Uncle
Vernon
had
then
treated
the
family
long
rant
about
what
would
like
with
beggars
and
vagrants
Vosn
judge
said
Krum
staring
Crouch
Isn
vith

Ministry
Harry
nodded
hesitated
for
moment
then
walked
slowly
toward
Crouch
who
did
not
look
him
but
continued
talk
nearby
tree
and
when

Crouch
said
Harry
cautiously
and
then
send
another
owl
Madame
Maxime
because
she
might
want
the
number
students
she
bringing
now
Karkaroff
made
round
dozen
that
Weatherby

Will

Crouch
eyes
were
bulging
stood
staring
the
tree
muttering
soundlessly
Then
staggered
sideways
and
fell
his
knees
Crouch
Harry
said
loudly
Are
you
all
right
Crouch
eyes
were
rolling
his
head
Harry
looked
around
Krum
who
had
followed
him
into
the
trees
and
was
looking
down
Crouch
alarm
Vot
wrong

Harry
muttered
Listen

Dumbledore
gasped
Crouch
reached
out
and
seized
handful
Harrys
robes
dragging
him
closer
though
his
eyes
were
staring
over
Harry
head
need
see
Dumbledore
Okay
said
Harry

Crouch

done
stupid
thing
Crouch
breathed
looked
utterly
mad
His
eyes
were
rolling
and
bulging
and
trickle
spittle
was
sliding
down
his
chin
Every
word
spoke
seemed
cost
him
terrible
effort
Must
tell
Dumbledore
Get

said
Harry
loudly
and
clearly
Get

Dumbledore
Crouch
eyes
rolled
forward
onto
Harry
Who

whispered
student
the
school
said
Harry
looking
around
Krum
for
some
help
but
Krum
was
hanging
back
looking
extremely
nervous
You

his
whispered
Crouch
his
mouth
sagging
said
Harry
without
the
faintest
idea
what
Crouch
was
talking
about
Dumbledore
That
right
said
Harry
Crouch
was
pulling
him
closer
Harry
tried
loosen
Crouch
grip
his
robes
but
was
too
powerful
Warn

Harry
Just

Mrs

Crouch
was
now
talking
fluently
tree
again
and
seemed
completely
unaware
that
Harry
was
there
which
surprised
Harry
much
didn
notice
that
Crouch
had
released
him
Yes

Krum
doubtfully
staring
down
Crouch

gabbling
the
tree
apparently
convinced

Percy
Just

him
said
Harry
starting
get
but
his
movement
seemed
trigger
another
abrupt
change
Crouch
who
seized
him
hard
around
the
knees
and
pulled
Harry
back
the
ground
Don

Harry

around
Krum
Help

Looking
extremely
apprehensive
Krum
moved
forward
and
squatted
down
next
Crouch
Just
keep
him
here
said
Harry
pulling
himself
free
Crouch
back
with
Dumbledore
Hurry
von

Krum
called
after
him
Harry
sprinted
away
from
the
forest
and
through
the
dark
grounds
They
were
deserted
Bagman
Cedric
and
Fleur
had
disappeared
Harry
tore
the
stone
steps
through
the
oak
front
doors
and
off
the
marble
staircase
toward
the
second
floor
Five
minutes
later
was
hurtling
toward

Perhaps

toward
the
staircase
POTTER
Harry
skidded
halt
and
looked
around
Snape
had
just
emerged
from
the
hidden
staircase
behind
the
stone
gargoyle
The
wall
was
sliding
shut
behind
him
even
beckoned
Harry
back
toward
him
What

Professor
Dumbledore
said
Harry
running
back
the
corridor
and
skidding

Snape
instead
Crouch
just
turned
the
forest
asking
What

Snape
his
black
eyes
glittering
What

Harry
shouted
From

Harry
yelled
Didn

Snape
was
thoroughly
enjoying
himself
denying

panicky
Look

Harry
angrily
Crouch

The
stone
wall
behind
Snape
slid
open
Dumbledore
was
standing
there
wearing
long
green
robes
and
mildly
curious
expression
there

said
looking
between
Harry
and
Snape
Professor
Harry
said
sidestepping
Snape
before
Snape
could
speak

Harry
expected
Dumbledore

questions
but
his
relief
Dumbledore
did
nothing

sort
Lead

way
said
promptly
and
swept
off
along
the
corridor
behind
Harry
leaving
Snape
standing
next
the
gargoyle
and
looking
twice
ugly
What
did
Crouch
say
Harry
said
Dumbledore
they
walked
swiftly
down
the
marble
staircase
Said

son
and
Bertha
Jorkins

Indeed
said
Dumbledore
and
quickened
his
pace
they
hurried
out
into
the
pitch
darkness
not
acting
normally
Harry
said
hurrying
along
beside
Dumbledore

Percy
Weasley

and
then
changes
and
says

Dumbledore
sharply
and

Harry
was
running

Harry
Krum
and
were

then
saw
Crouch
coming
out

forest
Where

Dumbledore
the
Beauxbatons

emerged
from
the
darkness
Over

holding
Its

ground
And
then
fell
upon
pair
feet
Harry
and
Dumbledore
hurried
forward
Krum
was
sprawled
the
forest
floor
seemed
unconscious
There
was
sign
all
Crouch
Dumbledore
bent
over
Krum
and
gently
lifted
one
his
eyelids
Stunned
said
softly
His
half
moon
glasses
glittered
the
wandlight
peered
around
the
surrounding
trees
Should

get
someone
said
Harry
Madam
Pomfrey
said
Dumbledore
swiftly
Stay
here
raised
his
wand
into
the
air
and
pointed
the
direction
Hagrid
cabin
Harry
saw
something
silvery
dart
out
and
streak
away
through
the
trees
like
ghostly
bird
Then
Dumbledore
bent
over
Krum
again
pointed
his
wand
him
and
muttered
Ennervate
Krum
opened
his
eyes
looked
dazed
When
saw
Dumbledore
tried
sit
but
Dumbledore
put
hand
his
shoulder
and
made
him
lie
still
attacked
Krum
muttered
putting
hand
his
head
The
old
madman

vos
looking
around

vare
Potter
had
gone
and
attacked
from
behind
Lie

for
moment
Dumbledore
said
The
sound
thunderous
footfalls
reached
them
and
Hagrid
came
panting
into
sight
with
Fang
his
heels
was
carrying
his
crossbow
Professor
Dumbledore
said
his
eyes
widening
Harry
what

Hagrid

Professor
Karkaroff
said
Dumbledore
His

Dumbledore
said
wheezy
growl
here
Moody
was
limping
toward
them
leaning
his
staff
his
wand
lit
Damn

said
furiously

Snape
said
something
about

Crouch
said
Hagrid
blankly
Karkaroff

said
Dumbledore
sharply

Hagrid
and

and
disappeared
into
the
dark
trees
Fang
trotting
after
him
don

where
Barty
Crouch
Dumbledore
told
Moody
but
essential

growled
Moody
and
pulled
out
his
wand
and
limped
off
into
the
forest
Neither
Dumbledore
nor
Harry
spoke
again
until
they
heard
the
unmistakable
sounds
Hagrid
and
Fang
returning
Karkaroff
was
hurrying
along
behind
them
was
wearing
his
sleek
silver
furs
and
looked
pale
and
agitated
What
this
cried
when
saw
Krum
the
ground
and
Dumbledore
and
Harry
beside
him

The

Dumbledore
began
but
Karkaroff

himself
clutching
his
furs
around
him
looking
livid
Treachery
bellowed
pointing
Dumbledore
plot
You

Dumbledore
This

Dumbledore

one
swift
movement
Hagrid
seized
the
front
Karkaroff
furs
lifted
him
into
the
air
and
slammed
him
against
nearby
tree
Apologize
Hagrid

Karkaroff
gasped
for

Hagrid
massive

his
throat
his
feet
dangling
midair
Hagrid
Dumbledore
shouted
his
eyes
flashing
Hagrid
removed
the
hand
pinning
Karkaroff
the
tree
and
Karkaroff
slid
all
the
way
down
the
trunk
and
slumped
huddle
its
roots
few
twigs
and
leaves
showered
down
upon
his
head
Kindly

Harry
back
the
castle
Hagrid
said
Dumbledore
sharply
Breathing
heavily
Hagrid

Karkaroff
glowering
look

Karkaroff

Stay

Harry
They
marched
silence
past
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
and
toward

castle
How

past

lake
How

him
front
the
Fat
Lady
clambered
through
the
portrait
hole
into
the
common
room
and
hurried
straight
for
the
corner
where
Ron
and
Hermione
were
sitting
tell
them
what
had
happened
CHAPTER
TWENTY
NINE
THE
DREAM
comes
down
this
said
Hermione
rubbing
her
forehead
Either
Crouch
attacked
Viktor
somebody
else
attacked
both
them
when
Viktor
wasn
looking
must
been
Crouch
said
Ron
once
That
why
was
gone
when
Harry
and
Dumbledore
got
there
done
runner
don
think
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
seemed
really
weak
don
reckon
was
Disapparating
anything
You
cant
Disapparate
the
Hogwarts
grounds
haven
told
you
enough
times
said
Hermione
Okay
hows
this
for
theory
said
Ron
excitedly
Krum
attacked
Crouch
wait
for
and
then
Stunned
himself
And
Crouch
evaporated
did
said
Hermione
coldly
yeah
was
daybreak
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
crept
out
their
dormitories
very
early
and
hurried
the
Owlery
together
send
note
Sirius
Now
they
were
standing
looking
out
the
misty
grounds
All
three
them
were
puffy
eyed
and
pale
because
they
had
been
talking
late
into
the
night
about
Crouch
Just
through
again
Harry
said
Hermione
What
did
Crouch
actually
say
told
you
wasn
making
much
sense
said
Harry
said
wanted
warn
Dumbledore
about
something
definitely
mentioned
Bertha
Jorkins
and
seemed
think
she
was
dead
kept
saying
stuff
was
his
fault
mentioned
his
son
Well
that
was
his
fault
said
Hermione
testily
was
out
his
mind
said
Harry
Half
the
time
seemed
think
his
wife
and
son
were
still
alive
and
kept
talking
Percy
about
work
and
giving
him
instructions
And
remind
what
said
about
You
Know
Who
said
Ron
tentatively
told
you
Harry
repeated
dully
said
getting
stronger
There
was
pause
Then
Ron
said
falsely
confident
voice
But
was
out
his
mind
like
you
said
half
was
probably
just
raving
was
sanest
when
was
trying
talk
about
Voldemort
said
Harry
and
Ron
winced
the
sound
the
name
was
having
real
trouble
stringing
two
words
together
but
that
was
when
seemed
know
where
was
and
know
what
wanted
just
kept
saying
had
see
Dumbledore
Harry
turned
away
from
the
window
and
stared
into
the
rafters
The
many
perches
were
half
empty
every
now
and
then
another
owl
would
swoop
through
one
the
windows
returning
from
its
night
hunting
with
mouse
its
beak
Snape
hadn
held
Harry
said
bitterly
might
got
there
time
The
headmaster
busy
Potter
what
this
rubbish
Potter
Why
couldn
have
just
got
out
the
way
Maybe
didn
want
you
get
there
said
Ron
quickly
Maybe
hang
how
fast
you
reckon
could
gotten
down
the
forest
you
reckon
could
beaten
you
and
Dumbledore
there
Not
unless
can
turn
himself
into
bat
something
said
Harry
Wouldn
put
past
him
Ron
muttered
need
see
Professor
Moody
said
Hermione
need
find
out
whether
found
Crouch
had
the
Marauder
Map
him
would
been
easy
said
Harry
Unless
Crouch
was
already
outside
the
grounds
said
Ron
because
only
shows
the
boundaries
doesn
Shh
said
Hermione
suddenly
Somebody
was
climbing
the
steps
the
Owlery
Harry
could
hear
two
voices
arguing
coming
closer
and
closer
that
blackmail
that
could
get
into
lot
trouble
for
that
tried
being
polite
time
play
dirty
like
him
wouldn
like
the
Ministry
Magic
knowing
what
did
telling
you
you
put
that
writing
blackmail
Yeah

complaining

nice
fat
payoff
will
you
The
Owlery
door
banged
open
Fred
and
George
came
over
the
threshold
then
froze
the
sight
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
What
you
doing
here
Ron
and
Fred
said
the
same
time
Sending
letter
said
Harry
and
George
unison
What
this
time
said
Hermione
and
Fred
Fred
grinned
Fine
won
ask
you
what
you
doing
you
don
ask
said
was
holding
sealed
envelope
his
hands
Harry
glanced
but
Fred
whether
accidentally
purpose
shifted
his
hand
that
the
name
was
covered
Well
don
let
hold
you
Fred
said
making
mock
bow
and
pointing
the
door
Ron
didn
move
Who
you
blackmailing
said
The
grin
vanished
from
Fred
face
Harry
saw
George
half
glance
Fred
before
smiling
Ron
Don
stupid
was
only
joking
said
easily
Didn
sound
like
that
said
Ron
Fred
and
George
looked
each
other
Then
Fred
said
abruptly
told
you
before
Ron
keep
your
nose
out
you
like
the
shape
Can
see
why
you
would
but
business

blackmailing
someone
said
Ron
George
right
you
could
end
serious
trouble
for
that
Told
you
was
joking
said
George
walked
over
Fred
pulled
the
letter
out
his
hands
and
began
attaching
the
leg
the
nearest
barn
owl
You
starting
sound
bit
like
our
dear
older
brother
you
are
Ron
Carry
like
this
and
you
made
prefect
won
said
Ron
hotly
George
carried
the
barn
owl
over
the
window
and
took
off
George
turned
around
and
grinned
Ron
Well
stop
telling
people
what
then
See
you
later
and
Fred
left
the
Owlery
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stared
one
another
You
don
think
they
know
something
about
all
this
you
Hermione
whispered
About
Crouch
and
everything
said
Harry
was
something
that
serious
they
tell
someone
They
tell
Dumbledore
Ron
however
was
looking
uncomfortable
What
the
matter
Hermione
asked
him
Well
said
Ron
slowly
dunno
they
would
They
they
obsessed
with
making
money
lately
noticed
when
was
hanging
around
with
them
when
you
know
weren
talking
Harry
finished
the
sentence
for
him
Yeah
but
blackmail
this
joke
shop
idea

said
Ron
thought
they
were
only
saying
annoy
Mum
but
they
really
mean
they
want
start
one
They
only
got
year
left
Hogwarts
they
keep
going
about
how
time

about
their
future
and
Dad

help
them
and
they
need
gold
get
started
Hermione
was
looking
uncomfortable
now
Yes
but
they
wouldn
anything
against
the
law
get
gold
Wouldn
they
said
Ron
looking
skeptical
dunno
they
don
exactly
mind
breaking
rules
they
Yes
but
this
the
law
said
Hermione
looking
scared
This
isn
some
silly
school
rule
They
get
lot
more
than
detention
for
blackmail
Ron
maybe
you
better
tell
Percy
Are
you
mad
said
Ron
Tell
Percy
probably
Crouch
and
turn
them
stared
the
window
through
which
Fred
and
George
owl
had
departed
then
said
Come
let
get
some
breakfast
you
think
too
early
and
see
Professor
Moody
Hermione
said
they
went
down
the
spiral
staircase
Yes
said
Harry
probably
blast
through
the
door
wake
him
the
crack
dawn
think
trying
attack
him
while
asleep
Let
give
till
break
History
Magic
had
rarely
gone
slowly
Harry
kept
checking
Ron
watch
having
finally
discarded
his
own
but
Ron
was
moving
slowly
could
have
sworn
had
stopped
working
too
All
three
them
were
tired
they
could
happily
have
put
their
heads
down
the
desks
and
slept
even
Hermione
wasn
taking
her
usual
notes
but
was
sitting
with
her
head
her
hand
gazing
Professor
Binns
with
her
eyes
out
focus
When
the
bell
finally
rang
they
hurried
out
into
the
corridors
toward
the
Dark
Arts
classroom
and
found
Professor
Moody
leaving
looked
tired
they
felt
The
eyelid
his
normal
eye
was
drooping
giving
his
face
even
more
lopsided
appearance
than
usual
Professor
Moody
Harry
called
they
made
their
way
toward
him
through
the
crowd
Hello
Potter
growled
Moody
His
magical
eye
followed
couple
passing
first
years
who
sped
looking
nervous
rolled
into
the
back
Moody
head
and
watched
them
around
the
corner
before
spoke
again
Come
here
stood
back
let
them
into
his
empty
classroom
limped
after
them
and
closed
the
door
Did
you
find
him
Harry
asked
without
preamble
Crouch
said
Moody
moved
over
his
desk
sat
down
stretched
out
his
wooden
leg
with
slight
groan
and
pulled
out
his
hip
flask
Did
you
use
the
map
Harry
said
course
said
Moody
taking
swig
from
his
flask
Took
leaf
out
your
book
Potter
Summoned
from
office
into
the
forest
wasn
anywhere
there

Disapparate
said
Ron
You

Disapparate
the
grounds
Ron
said
Hermione
There
are
other
ways
could
have
disappeared
aren
there
Professor
Moody
magical
eye
quivered
rested
Hermione
You
another
one
who
might
think
about
career
Auror
told
her
Mind

the
right
way
Granger
Hermione
flushed
pink
with
pleasure
Well
wasn
invisible
said
Harry
The
map
shows
invisible
people
must
left
the
grounds
then
But
under
his
own
steam
said
Hermione
eagerly
because
someone
made
him
Yeah
someone
could
could
pulled
him
onto
broom
and
flown
off
with
him
couldn
they
said
Ron
quickly
looking
hopefully
Moody
too
wanted
told
had
the
makings
Auror
can
rule
out
kidnap
growled
Moody
said
Ron
you
reckon
somewhere
Hogsmeade
Could
anywhere
said
Moody
shaking
his
head
Only
thing
know
for
sure
that
not
here
yawned
widely
that
his
scars
stretched
and
his
lopsided
mouth
revealed
number
missing
teeth
Then
said
Now
Dumbledore
told
you
three
fancy
yourselves
investigators
but
there
nothing
you
can
for
Crouch
The
Ministry
looking
for
him
now
Dumbledore
notified
them
Potter
you
just
keep
your
mind
the
third
task
What
said
Harry
yeah
hadn
given
the
maze
single
thought
since
left
with
Krum
the
previous
night
Should
right
your
street
this
one
said
Moody
looking
Harry
and
scratching
his
scarred
and
stubbly
chin
From
what
Dumbledore
said
you
managed
get
through
stuff
like
this
plenty
times
Broke
your
way
through
series
obstacles
guarding
the
Sorcerers
Stone
your
first
year
didn
you
helped
Ron
said
quickly
and
Hermione
helped
Moody
grinned
Well
help
him
practice
for
this
one
and
very
surprised
doesn
win
said
Moody
the
meantime
constant
vigilance
Potter
Constant
vigilance
took
another
long
draw
from
his
hip
flask
and
his
magical
eye
swiveled
onto
the
window
The
topmost
sail
the
Durmstrang
ship
was
visible
through
You
two
counseled
Moody
his
normal
eye
Ron
and
Hermione
you
stick
close
Potter
all
right
keeping
eye
things
but
all
the
same
you
can
never
have
too
many
eyes
out
Sirius
sent
their
owl
back
the
very
next
morning
fluttered
down
beside
Harry
the
same
moment
that
tawny
owl
landed
front
Hermione
clutching
copy
the
Daily
Prophet
its
beak
She
took
the
newspaper
scanned
the
first
few
pages
said
She
hasn
got
wind
Crouch
then
joined
Ron
and
Harry
reading
what
Sirius
had
say
the
mysterious
events
the
night
before
last
Harry
what
you
think
you
are
playing
walking
off
into
the
forest
with
Viktor
Krum
want
you
swear
return
owl
that
you
are
not
going
walking
with
anyone
else
night
There
somebody
highly
dangerous
Hogwarts
clear
that
they
wanted
stop
Crouch
from
seeing
Dumbledore
and
you
were
probably
feet
away
from
them
the
dark
You
could
have
been
killed
Your
name
didn
get
into
the
Goblet
Fire
accident
someone
trying
attack
you
they
their
last
chance
Stay
close
Ron
and
Hermione
not
leave
Gryffindor
Tower
after
hours
and
arm
yourself
for
the
third
task
Practice
Stunning
and
Disarming
few
hexes
wouldn
amiss
either
There
nothing
you
can
about
Crouch
Keep
your
head
down
and
look
after
yourself
waiting
for
your
letter
giving
your
word
you
won
stray
out
bounds
again
Sirius
Who
lecture
about
being
out
bounds
said
Harry
mild
indignation
folded
Sirius
letter
and
put
inside
his
robes
After
all
the
stuff
did

The
Hogwarts
grounds
never
looked
more
inviting
than
when
Harry
had
stay
indoors
For
the
next
few
days
spent
all
his
free
time
either
the
library
with
Hermione
and
Ron
looking
hexes
else
empty
classrooms
which
they
sneaked
into
practice
Harry
was
concentrating

Stunning
Spell
which

never
used
before
The
trouble
was
that
practicing
involved
certain
sacrifices
Ron

Hermione
impatiently
rearranging

pile
cushions
they
had
used
for
the
Banishing
Spell

Flitwick
had

Just

Ron
angrily
Why

Hermione
hastily
And

The

They
hastily
shoved

back
into
Flitwicks
cupboard
and
slipped
out
the
classroom
See

said
Hermione
and
she
set
off
for
Arithmancy
while
Harry
and
Ron
headed
toward
North
Tower
and
Divination
Broad
strips
dazzling
gold
sunlight

across
the
corridor
from
the

windows
The

brightly
blue

been
enameled
going
boiling
Trelawney
room
she
never
puts
out
that
fire
said
Ron
they
started
the
staircase
toward
the
silver
ladder
and
the
trapdoor
was
quite
right
The
dimly
lit
room
was
swelteringly
hot
The
fumes
from
the
perfumed
fire
were
heavier
than
ever
Harrys
head
swam
made
his
way
over
one
the
curtained
windows
While
Professor
Trelawney
was
looking
the
other
way
disentangling
her
shawl
from
lamp
opened
inch
and
settled
back
his
chintz
armchair
that
soft
breeze
played
across
his
face
was
extremely
comfortable
dears
said
Professor
Trelawney
sitting
down
her
winged
armchair
front
the
class
and
peering
around
them
all
with
her
strangely
enlarged
eyes
have
almost
finished
our
work
planetary
divination
Today
however
will
excellent
opportunity
examine
the
effects
Mars
for
placed
most
interestingly
the
present
time
you
will
all
look
this
way
will
dim
the
lights
She
waved
her
wand
and
the
lamps
went
out
The
fire
was
the
only
source
light
now
Professor
Trelawney
bent
down
and
lifted
from
under
her
chair
miniature
model
the
solar
system
contained
within
glass
dome
was
beautiful
thing
each
the
moons
glimmered
place
around
the
nine
planets
and
the
fiery
sun
all
them
hanging
thin
air
beneath
the
glass
Harry
watched
lazily
Professor
Trelawney
began
point
out
the
fascinating
angle
Mars
was
making
Neptune
The
heavily
perfumed
fumes
washed
over
him
and
the
breeze
from
the
window
played
across
his
face
could
hear
insect
humming
gently
somewhere
behind
the
curtain
His
eyelids
began
droop
was
riding
the
back
eagle
owl
soaring
through
the
clear
blue
sky
toward
old
ivy
covered
house
set
high
hillside
Lower
and
lower
they
flew
the
wind
blowing
pleasantly
Harry
face
until
they
reached
dark
and
broken
window
the
upper
story
the
house
and
entered
Now
they
were
flying
along
gloomy
passageway
room
the
very
end
through
the
door
they
went
into
dark
room
whose
windows
were
boarded
Harry
had
left
the
owl
back
was
watching
now
fluttered
across
the
room
into
chair
with
its
back
him
There
were
two
dark
shapes
the
floor
beside
the
chair
both
them
were
stirring
One
was
huge
snake
the
other
was
man
short
balding
man
man
with
watery
eyes
and
pointed
nose
was
wheezing
and
sobbing
the
hearth
rug
You
are
luck
Wormtail
said
cold
high
pitched
voice
from
the
depths
the
chair
which
the
owl
had
landed
You
are
very
fortunate
indeed
Your
blunder
has
not
ruined
everything
dead
Lord
gasped
the
man
the
floor
Lord
pleased
and
sorry
Nagini
said
the
cold
voice
you
are
out
luck
will
not
feeding
Wormtail
you
after
all
but
never
mind
never
mind
there
still
Harry
Potter
The
snake
hissed
Harry
could
see
its
tongue
fluttering
Now
Wormtail
said
the
cold
voice
perhaps
one
more
little
reminder
why
will
not
tolerate
another
blunder
from
you
Lord
beg
you
The
tip
wand
emerged
from
around
the
back
the
chair
was
pointing
Wormtail
Crucio
said
the
cold
voice
Wormtail
screamed
screamed
though
every
nerve
his
body
were
fire
the
screaming
filled
Harry
ears
the
scar
his
forehead
seared
with
pain
was
yelling
too
Voldemort
would
hear
him
would
know
was
there
Harry
Harry
Harry
opened
his
eyes
was
lying
the
floor
Professor
Trelawney
room
with
his
hands
over
his
face
His
scar
was
still
burning
badly
that
his
eyes
were
watering
The
pain
had
been
real
The
whole
class
was
standing
around
him
and
Ron
was
kneeling
next
him
looking
terrified
You
all
right
said
course
isn
said
Professor
Trelawney
looking
thoroughly
excited
Her
great
eyes
loomed
over
Harry
gazing
him
What
was
Potter
premonition
apparition
What
did
you
see
Nothing
Harry
lied
sat
could
feel
himself
shaking
couldn
stop
himself
from
looking
around
into
the
shadows
behind
him
Voldemorts
voice
had
sounded
close
You
were
clutching
your
scar
said
Professor
Trelawney
You
were
rolling
the
floor
clutching
your
scar
Come

Potter

matters
Harry
looked

Professor
Trelawney

may
lose
the
opportunity

than
you

anything
except

said
Harry
stood
The
class
backed
away
They
all
looked
unnerved
See
you
later
Harry
muttered
Ron
and
picked
his
bag
and
headed
for
the
trapdoor
ignoring
Professor
Trelawney
who
was
wearing
expression
great
frustration
though
she
had
just
been
denied
real
treat
When
Harry
reached
the
bottom
her
stepladder
however
did
not
set
off
for
the
hospital
wing
had
intention
whatsoever
going
there
Sirius
had
told
him
what
his
scar
hurt
him
again
and
Harry
was
going
follow
his
advice
was
going
straight
Dumbledore
office
marched
down
the
corridors
thinking
about
what
had
seen
the
dream
had
been
vivid
the
one
that
had
awoken
him
Privet
Drive
ran
over
the
details
his
mind
trying
make
sure
could
remember
them
had
heard
Voldemort
accusing
Wormtail
making
blunder
but
the
owl
had
brought
good
news
the
blunder
had
been
repaired
somebody
was
dead
Wormtail
was
not
going
fed
the
snake
Harry
was
going
fed
instead
Harry
had
walked
right
past
the
stone
gargoyle
guarding
the
entrance
Dumbledores
office
without
noticing
blinked
looked
around
realized
what
had
done
and
retraced
his
steps
stopping
front
Then
remembered
that
didn
know
the
password
Sherbet
lemon
tried
tentatively
The
gargoyle
did
not
move
Okay

Harry

said
angrily

its
urgent
The
gargoyle
remained
immovable
Harry
kicked
achieving
nothing
but
excruciating
pain
his
big
toe
Chocolate
Frog
yelled
angrily
standing
one
leg
Sugar
Quill
Cockroach
Cluster
The
gargoyle
sprang
life
and
jumped
aside
Harry
blinked
Cockroach
Cluster
said
amazed
was
only
joking
hurried
through
the
gap
the
walls
and
stepped
onto
the
foot
spiral
stone
staircase
which
moved
slowly
upward
the
doors
closed
behind
him
taking
him
polished
oak
door
with
brass
door
knocker
could
hear
voices
from
inside
the
office
stepped
off
the
moving
staircase
and
hesitated
listening
Dumbledore
afraid
don
see
the
connection
don
see
all
was
the
voice
the
Minister
Magic
Cornelius
Fudge
Ludo
says
Berthas
perfectly
capable
getting
herself
lost
agree
would
have
expected
have
found
her
now
but
all
the
same
evidence
foul
play
Dumbledore
none
all
for
her
disappearance
being
linked
with
Barty
Crouch
And
what
you
thinks
happened
Barty
Crouch
Minister
said
Moody
growling
voice
see
two
possibilities
Alastor
said
Fudge
Either
Crouch
has
finally
cracked
more
than
likely
sure
you
agree
given
his
personal
history
lost
his
mind
and
gone
wandering
off
somewhere
wandered
extremely
quickly
that
the
case
Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
calmly
else
well
Fudge
sounded
embarrassed
Well
reserve
judgment
until
after
seen
the
place
where
was
found
but
you
say
was
just
past
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
Dumbledore
you
know
what
that
woman
consider
her
very
able
headmistress
and
excellent
dancer
said
Dumbledore
quietly
Dumbledore
come
said
Fudge
angrily
Don
you
think
you
might
prejudiced
her
favor
because
Hagrid
They
don
all
turn
out
harmless
indeed
you
can
call
Hagrid
harmless
with
that
monster
fixation
got
more
suspect
Madame
Maxime
than
Hagrid
said
Dumbledore
just
calmly
think
possible
that
you
who
are
prejudiced
Cornelius
Can
wrap
this
discussion
growled
Moody
Yes
yes
let
down
the
grounds
then
said
Fudge
impatiently
not
that
said
Moody
just
that
Potter
wants
word
with
you
Dumbledore
just
outside
the
door
CHAPTER
THIRTY
THE
PENSIEVE
The
door
the
office
opened
Hello
Potter
said
Moody
Come
then
Harry
walked
inside
had
been
inside
Dumbledore
office
once
before
was
very
beautiful
circular
room
lined
with
pictures
previous
headmasters
and
headmistresses
Hogwarts
all
whom
were
fast
asleep
their
chests
rising
and
falling
gently
Cornelius
Fudge
was
standing
beside
Dumbledore
desk
wearing
his
usual
pinstriped
cloak
and
holding
his
lime
green
bowler
hat
Harry
said
Fudge
jovially
moving
forward
How
are
you
Fine
Harry
lied
were
just
talking
about
the
night
when
Crouch
turned
the
grounds
said
Fudge
was
you
who
found
him
was
not
Yes
said
Harry
Then
feeling
was
pointless
pretend
that
hadn
overheard
what
they
had
been
saying
added
didn
see
Madame
Maxime
anywhere
though
and
she
have
job
hiding
wouldn
she
Dumbledore
smiled
Harry
behind
Fudge
back
his
eyes
twinkling
Yes
well
said
Fudge
looking
embarrassed
about
for
short
walk
the
grounds
Harry
you
excuse
perhaps
you
just
back
your
class
wanted
talk
you
Professor
Harry
said
quickly
looking
Dumbledore
who
gave
him
swift
searching
look
Wait
here
for
Harry
said
Our
examination
the
grounds
will
not
take
long
They
trooped
out
silence
past
him
and
closed
the
door
After
minute
Harry
heard
the
clunks
Moody
wooden
leg
growing
fainter
the
corridor
below
looked
around
Hello
Fawkes
said
Fawkes
Professor
Dumbledore
phoenix
was
standing
his
golden
perch
beside
the
door
The
size
swan
with
magnificent
scarlet
and
gold
plumage
swished
his
long
tail
and
blinked
benignly
Harry
Harry
sat
down
chair
front
Dumbledore
desk
For
several
minutes
sat
and
watched
the
old
headmasters
and
headmistresses
snoozing
their
frames
thinking
about
what
had
just
heard
and
running
his
fingers
over
his
scar
had
stopped
hurting
now
felt
much
calmer
somehow
now
that
was
Dumbledore
office
knowing
would
shortly
telling
him
about
the
dream
Harry
looked
the
walls
behind
the
desk
The
patched
and
ragged
Sorting
Hat
was
standing
shelf
glass
case
next
held
magnificent
silver
sword
with
large
rubies
set
into
the
hilt
which
Harry
recognized
the
one
himself
had
pulled
out
the
Sorting
Hat
his
second
year
The
sword
had
once
belonged
Godric
Gryffindor
founder
Harry
House
was
gazing
remembering
how
had
come
his
aid
when
had
thought
all
hope
was
lost
when
noticed
patch
silvery
light
dancing
and
shimmering
the
glass
case
looked
around
for
the
source
the
light
and
saw
sliver
silver
white
shining
brightly
from
within
black
cabinet
behind
him
whose
door
had
not
been
closed
properly
Harry
hesitated
glanced
Fawkes
then
got
walked
across
the
office
and
pulled
open
the
cabinet
door
shallow
stone
basin
lay
there
with
odd
carvings
around
the
edge
runes
and
symbols
that
Harry
did
not
recognize
The
silvery
light
was
coming
from
the
basin
contents
which
were
like
nothing
Harry
had
ever
seen
before
could
not
tell
whether
the
substance
was
liquid
gas
was
bright
whitish
silver
and
was
moving
ceaselessly
the
surface
became
ruffled
like
water
beneath
wind
and
then
like
clouds
separated
and
swirled
smoothly
looked
like
light
made
liquid
like
wind
made
solid
Harry
couldn
make
his
mind
wanted
touch
find
out
what
felt
like
but
nearly
four
years
experience
the
magical
world
told
him
that
sticking
his
hand
into
bowl
full
some
unknown
substance
was
very
stupid
thing
therefore
pulled
his
wand
out
the
inside
his
robes
cast
nervous
look
around
the
office
looked
back
the
contents
the
basin
and
prodded
them
The
surface
the
silvery
stuff
inside
the
basin
began
swirl
very
fast
Harry
bent
closer
his
head
right
inside
the
cabinet
The
silvery
substance
had
become
transparent
looked
like
glass
looked
down
into
expecting
see
the
stone
bottom
the
basin
and
saw
instead
enormous
room
below
the
surface
the
mysterious
substance
room
into
which
seemed
looking
through
circular
window
the
ceiling
The
room
was
dimly
lit
thought
might
even
underground
for
there
were
windows
merely
torches
brackets
such
the
ones
that
illuminated
the
walls
Hogwarts
Lowering
his
face
that
his
nose
was
mere
inch
away
from
the
glassy
substance
Harry
saw
that
rows
and
rows
witches
and
wizards
were
seated
around
every
wall
what
seemed
benches
rising
levels
empty
chair
stood
the
very
center
the
room
There
was
something
about
the
chair
that
gave
Harry
ominous
feeling
Chains
encircled
the
arms
though
its
occupants
were
usually
tied
Where
was
this
place
surely
wasn
Hogwarts
had
never
seen
room
like
that
here
the
castle
Moreover
the
crowd
the
mysterious
room
the
bottom
the
basin
was
comprised
adults
and
Harry
knew
there
were
not
nearly
that
many
teachers
Hogwarts
They
seemed
thought
waiting
for
something
even
though
could
only
see
the
tops
their
hats
all
their
faces
seemed
pointing
one
direction
and
none
them
were
talking
one
another
The
basin
being
circular
and
the
room
was
observing
square
Harry
could
not
make
out
what
was
going
the
corners
leaned
even
closer
tilting
his
head
trying
see
The
tip
his
nose
touched
the
strange
substance
into
which
was
staring
Dumbledore
office
gave
almighty
lurch
Harry
was
thrown
forward
and
pitched
headfirst
into
the
substance
inside
the
basin
But
his
head
did
not
hit
the
stone
bottom
was
falling
through
something
icy
cold
and
black
was
like
being
sucked
into
dark
whirlpool
And
suddenly
Harry
found
himself
sitting
bench
the
end
the
room
inside
the
basin
bench
raised
high
above
the
others
looked
the
high
stone
ceiling
expecting
see
the
circular
window
through
which
had
just
been
staring
but
there
was
nothing
there
but
dark
solid
stone
Breathing
hard
and
fast
Harry
looked
around
him
Not
one
the
witches
and
wizards
the
room
and
there
were
least
two
hundred
them
was
looking
him
Not
one
them
seemed
have
noticed
that
fourteen
year
old
boy
had
just
dropped
from
the
ceiling
into
their
midst
Harry
turned
the
wizard
next
him
the
bench
and
uttered
loud
cry
surprise
that
reverberated
around
the
silent
room
was
sitting
right
next
Albus
Dumbledore
Professor
Harry
said
kind
strangled
whisper
sorry
didn
mean
was
just
looking
that
basin
your
cabinet
where
are
But
Dumbledore
didn
move
speak
ignored
Harry
completely
Like
every
other
wizard
the
benches
was
staring
into
the
far
corner
the
room
where
there
was
door
Harry
gazed
nonplussed
Dumbledore
then
around
the
silently
watchful
crowd
then
back
Dumbledore
And
then
dawned
him
Once
before
Harry
had
found
himself
somewhere
that
nobody
could
see
hear
him
That
time
had
fallen
through
page
enchanted
diary
right
into
somebody
else
memory
and
unless
was
very
much
mistaken
something
the
sort
had
happened
again
Harry
raised
his
right
hand
hesitated
and
then
waved
energetically
from
Dumbledore
face
Dumbledore
did
not
blink
look
around
Harry
indeed
move
all
And
that
Harry
opinion
settled
the
matter
Dumbledore
wouldn
ignore
him
like
that
was
inside
memory
and
this
was
not
the
present
day
Dumbledore
Yet
couldn
that
long
ago
the
Dumbledore
sitting
next
him
now
was
silver
haired
just
like
the
present
day
Dumbledore
But
what
was
this
place
What
were
all
these
wizards
waiting
for
Harry
looked
around
more
carefully
The
room
had
suspected
when
observing
from
above
was
almost
certainly
underground
more
dungeon
than
room
thought
There
was
bleak
and
forbidding
air
about
the
place
there
were
pictures
the
walls
decorations
all
just
these
serried
rows
benches
rising
levels
all
around
the
room
all
positioned
that
they
had
clear
view
that
chair
with
the
chains
its
arms
Before
Harry
could
reach
any
conclusions
about
the
place
which
they
were
heard
footsteps
The
door
the
corner
the
dungeon
opened
and
three
people
entered
least
one
man
flanked
two
dementors
Harry
insides
went
cold
The
dementors
tall
hooded
creatures
whose
faces
were
concealed
were
gliding
slowly
toward
the
chair
the
center
the
room
each
grasping
one
the
man
arms
with
their
dead
and
rotten
looking
hands
The
man
between
them
looked
though
was
about
faint
and
Harry
couldn
blame
him
knew
the
dementors
could
not
touch
him
inside
memory
but
remembered
their
power
only
too
well
The
watching
crowd
recoiled
slightly
the
dementors
placed
the
man
the
chained
chair
and
glided
back
out
the
room
The
door
swung
shut
behind
them
Harry
looked
down
the
man
now
sitting
the
chair
and
saw
that
was
Karkaroff
Unlike
Dumbledore
Karkaroff
looked
much
younger
his
hair
and
goatee
were
black
was
not
dressed
sleek
furs
but
thin
and
ragged
robes
was
shaking
Even
Harry
watched
the
chains
the
arms
the
chair
glowed
suddenly
gold
and
snaked
their
way
Karkaroff
arms
binding
him
there
Igor
Karkaroff
said
curt
voice
Harry
left
Harry
looked
around
and
saw
Crouch
standing
the
middle
the
bench
beside
him
Crouch
hair
was
dark
his
face
was
much
less
lined
looked
fit
and
alert
You
have
been
brought
from
Azkaban
present
evidence
the
Ministry
Magic
You
have
given
understand
that
you
have
important
information
for
Karkaroff
straightened
himself
best
could
tightly
bound
the
chair
have
sir
said
and
although
his
voice
was
very
scared
Harry
could
still
hear
the
familiar
unctuous
note
wish
use
the
Ministry
wish
help
know
that
the
Ministry
trying
round
the
last
the
Dark
Lords
supporters
eager
assist
any
way
can
There
was
murmur
around
the
benches
Some
the
wizards
and
witches
were
surveying
Karkaroff
with
interest
others
with
pronounced
mistrust
Then
Harry
heard
quite
distinctly
from
Dumbledores
other
side
familiar
growling
voice
saying
Filth
Harry
leaned
forward
that
could
see
past
Dumbledore
Mad
Eye
Moody
was
sitting
there
except
that
there
was
very
noticeable
difference
his
appearance
did
not
have
his
magical
eye
but
two
normal
ones
Both
were
looking
down
upon
Karkaroff
and
both
were
narrowed
intense
dislike
Crouch
going
let
him
out
Moody
breathed
quietly
Dumbledore
done
deal
with
him
Took
six
months
track
him
down
and
Crouch
going
let
him
got
enough
new
names
Let
hear
his
information
say
and
throw
him
straight
back
the
dementors
Dumbledore
made
small
noise
dissent
through
his
long
crooked
nose
was
forgetting
you
don
like
the
dementors
you
Albus
said
Moody
with
sardonic
smile
said
Dumbledore
calmly
afraid
don
have
long
felt
the
Ministry
wrong
ally
itself
with
such
creatures
But
for
filth
like
this
Moody
said
softly
You
say
you
have
names
for
Karkaroff
said
Crouch
Let
hear
them
please
You
must
understand
said
Karkaroff
hurriedly
that
Who
Must
Not
Named
operated
always
the
greatest
secrecy
preferred
that
mean
say
his
supporters
and
regret
now
very
deeply
that
ever
counted
myself
among
them
Get
with
sneered
Moody
never
knew
the
names
every
one
our
fellows
alone
knew
exactly
who
all
were
Which
was
wise
move
wasn
prevented
someone
like
you
Karkaroff
from
turning
all
them
muttered
Moody
Yet
you
say
you
have
some
names
for
said
Crouch
said
Karkaroff
breathlessly
And
these
were
important
supporters
mark
you
People
saw
with
own
eyes
doing
his
bidding
give
this
information
sign
that
fully
and
totally
renounce
him
and
filled
with
remorse
deep
can
barely
These
names
are
said
Crouch
sharply
Karkaroff
drew
deep
breath
There
was
Antonin
Dolohov
said
saw
him
torture
countless
Muggles
and
and
non
supporters
the
Dark
Lord
And
helped
him
murmured
Moody
have
already
apprehended
Dolohov
said
Crouch
was
caught
shortly
after
yourself
Indeed
said
Karkaroff
his
eyes
widening
delighted
hear
But
didn
look
Harry
could
tell
that
this
news
had
come
real
blow
him
One
his
names
was
worthless
Any
others
said
Crouch
coldly
Why
yes
there
was
Rosier
said
Karkaroff
hurriedly
Evan
Rosier
Rosier
dead
said
Crouch
was
caught
shortly
after
you
were
too
preferred
fight
rather
than
come
quietly
and
was
killed
the
struggle
Took
bit
with
him
though
whispered
Moody
Harry
right
Harry
looked
around
him
once
more
and
saw
him
indicating
the
large
chunk
out
his
nose
Dumbledore
more
than
Rosier
deserved
said
Karkaroff
real
note
panic
his
voice
now
Harry
could
see
that
was
starting
worry
that
none
his
information
would
any
use
the
Ministry
Karkaroff
eyes
darted
toward
the
door
the
corner
behind
which
the
dementors
undoubtedly
still
stood
waiting
Any
more
said
Crouch
Yes
said
Karkaroff
There
was
Travers
helped
murder
the
McKinnons
Mulciber
specialized
the
Imperius
Curse
forced
countless
people
horrific
things
Rookwood
who
was
spy
and
passed
Who
Must
Not
Named
useful
information
from
inside
the
Ministry
itself
Harry
could
tell
that
this
time
Karkaroff
had
struck
gold
The
watching
crowd
was
all
murmuring
together
Rookwood
said
Crouch
nodding
witch
sitting
front
him
who
began
scribbling
upon
her
piece
parchment
Augustus
Rookwood
the
Department
Mysteries
The
very
same
said
Karkaroff
eagerly
believe
used
network
well
placed
wizards
both

the
Ministry
and
out

information
But
Travers
and
Mulciber
have
said
Crouch
Very
well
Karkaroff
that
all
you
will
returned
Azkaban
while
decide
Not
yet
cried
Karkaroff
looking
quite
desperate
Wait
have
more
Harry
could
see
him
sweating
the
torchlight
his
white
skin
contrasting
strongly
with
the
black
his
hair
and
beard
Snape
shouted
Severus
Snape
Snape
has
been
cleared
this
council
said
Crouch
disdainfully
has
been
vouched
for
Albus
Dumbledore
shouted
Karkaroff
straining
the
chains
that
bound
him
the
chair
assure
you
Severus
Snape
Death
Eater
Dumbledore
had
gotten
his
feet
have
given
evidence
already
this
matter
said
calmly
Severus
Snape
was
indeed
Death
Eater
However
rejoined
our
side
before
Lord
Voldemort
downfall
and
turned
spy
for
great
personal
risk
now
more
Death
Eater
than
Harry
turned
look
Mad
Eye
Moody
was
wearing
look
deep
skepticism
behind
Dumbledore
back
Very
well
Karkaroff
Crouch
said
coldly
you
have
been
assistance
shall
review
your
case
You
will
return
Azkaban
the
meantime
Crouch
voice
faded
Harry
looked
around
the
dungeon
was
dissolving
though
were
made
smoke
everything
was
fading
could
see
only
his
own
body
all
else
was
swirling
darkness
And
then
the
dungeon
returned
Harry
was
sitting
different
seat
still
the
highest
bench
but
now
the
left
side
Crouch
The
atmosphere
seemed
quite
different
relaxed
even
cheerful
The
witches
and
wizards
all
around
the
walls
were
talking
one
another
almost
though
they
were
some
sort
sporting
event
Harry
noticed
witch
halfway
the
rows
benches
opposite
She
had
short
blonde
hair
was
wearing
magenta
robes
and
was
sucking
the
end
acid
green
quill
was
unmistakably
younger
Rita
Skeeter
Harry
looked
around
Dumbledore
was
sitting
beside
him
again
wearing
different
robes
Crouch
looked
more
tired
and
somehow
fiercer
gaunter
Harry
understood
was
different
memory
different
day
different
trial
The
door
the
corner
opened
and
Ludo
Bagman
walked
into
the
room
This
was
not
however
Ludo
Bagman
gone
seed
but
Ludo
Bagman
who
was
clearly
the
height
his
Quidditch
playing
fitness
His
nose
wasn
broken
now
was
tall
and
lean
and
muscular
Bagman
looked
nervous
sat
down
the
chained
chair
but
did
not
bind
him
there
had
bound
Karkaroff
and
Bagman
perhaps
taking
heart
from
this
glanced
around
the
watching
crowd
waved
couple
them
and
managed
small
smile
Ludo
Bagman
you
have
been
brought
here
front
the
Council
Magical
Law

Crouch

the
evidence
against
you
and
are
about

our
verdict

anything

your
testimony
before

judgment
Harry
couldn
believe
his
ears
Ludo
Bagman
Death
Eater
Only
said
Bagman
smiling
awkwardly
well
know
been
bit
idiot
One
two
wizards
and
witches
the
surrounding
seats
smiled
indulgently
Crouch
did
not
appear
share
their
feelings
was
staring
down
Ludo
Bagman
with
expression
the
utmost
severity
and
dislike
You
never
spoke
truer
word
boy
someone
muttered
dryly
Dumbledore
behind
Harry
looked
around
and
saw
Moody
sitting
there
again
didn
know
always
been
dim
have
said
some
those
Bludgers
had
permanently
affected
his
brain
Ludovic
Bagman

Lord
Voldemort
supporters
said
Crouch
For
this
suggest
term
imprisonment
Azkaban
lasting
less
than
But
there
was
angry
outcry
from
the
surrounding
benches
Several
the
witches
and
wizards
around
the
walls
stood
shaking
their
heads
and
even
their
fists
Crouch
But
told
you
had
idea
Bagman
called
earnestly
over
the
crowd
babble
his
round
blue
eyes
widening
None
all
Old
Rookwood
was
friend
dad
never
crossed
mind
was
with
You
Know
Who
thought

information
for
our
side
And
Rookwood
kept
talking
about

Ministry
later
once
Quidditch
days

over

keep
getting
hit
Bludgers
for
the
rest

There
were
titters
from
the
crowd
will
put
the
vote
said
Crouch
coldly
turned
the
right
hand
side
the
dungeon
The
jury
will
please
raise
their
hands
those
favor
imprisonment
Harry
looked
toward
the
right
hand
side
the
dungeon
Not
one
person
raised
their
hand
Many
the
witches
and
wizards
around
the
walls
began
clap
One
the
witches
the
jury
stood
Yes
barked
Crouch
just
like
congratulate
Bagman
his
splendid
performance
for
England
the
Quidditch
match
against
Turkey
last
Saturday
the
witch
said
breathlessly
Crouch
looked
furious
The
dungeon
was
ringing
with
applause
now
Bagman
got
his
feet
and
bowed
beaming
Despicable
Crouch
spat
Dumbledore
sitting
down
Bagman
walked
out
the
dungeon
Rookwood
get
him
job
indeed
The
day
Ludo
Bagman
joins
will
sad
day
indeed
for
the
Ministry
And
the
dungeon
dissolved
again
When
had
returned
Harry
looked
around
and
Dumbledore
were
still
sitting
beside
Crouch
but
the
atmosphere
could
not
have
been
more
different
There
was
total
silence
broken
only
the
dry
sobs
frail
wispy
looking
witch
the
seat
next
Crouch
She
was
clutching
handkerchief
her
mouth
with
trembling
hands
Harry
looked
Crouch
and
saw
that
looked
gaunter
and
grayer
than
ever
before
nerve
was
twitching
his
temple
Bring
them
said
and
his
voice
echoed
through
the
silent
dungeon
The
door
the
corner
opened
yet
again
Six
dementors
entered
this
time
flanking
group
four
people
Harry
saw
the
people
the
crowd
turn
look
Crouch
few
them
whispered
one
another
The
dementors
placed
each
the
four
people
the
four
chairs
with
chained
arms
that
now
stood
the
dungeon
floor
There
was
thickset
man
who
stared
blankly
Crouch
thinner
and
more
nervous
looking
man
whose
eyes
were
darting
around
the
crowd
woman
with
thick
shining
dark
hair
and
heavily
hooded
eyes
who
was
sitting
the
chained
chair
though
were
throne

boy
his
late
teens
who
looked
nothing
short
petrified
was
shivering
his
straw
colored
hair
all
over
his
face
his
freckled
skin
milk
white
The
wispy
little
witch
beside
Crouch
began
rock
backward
and
forward
her
seat
whimpering
into
her
handkerchief
Crouch
stood
looked
down
upon
the
four
front
him
and
there
was
pure
hatred
his
face
You
have
been
brought
here
before
the
Council
Magical
Law

clearly
that

pass
judgment

the

the

and
forward

unison
the
witches
and

along
the
right

side
the
dungeon
raised
their
hands
The
crowd
around
the
walls
began
clap
had
for
Bagman
their
faces
full
savage
triumph
The
boy
began
scream
Mother
didn

didn
know
Don

The
dementors
were
gliding
back
into
the
room
The
boys
three
companions
rose
quietly
from
their
seats
the
woman
with
the
heavy
lidded
eyes
looked
Crouch
and
called
The
Dark
Lord

rise
again
Crouch
Throw

But
the
boy
was
trying
fight
off
the
dementors
even
though
Harry
could
see
their
cold
draining
power
starting
affect
him
The
crowd
was
jeering
some
them
their
feet
the
woman
swept
out
the
dungeon
and
the
boy
continued
struggle

Crouch

The

and
slumped
her
seat
She
had
fainted
Crouch

noticed
Take

the
dementors

from
his
mouth

said
quiet
voice
Harrys
ear
Harry
started
looked
around
Then
looked
his
other
side
There
was
Albus
Dumbledore
sitting
his
right
watching
Crouch
son
being
dragged
away
the
dementors
and
there
was
Albus
Dumbledore
his
left
looking
right
him
Come
said
the
Dumbledore
his
left
and
put
his
hand
under
Harrys
elbow
Harry
felt
himself
rising
into
the
air
the
dungeon
dissolved
around
him
for
moment
all
was
blackness
and
then
felt
though
had
done
slow
motion
somersault
suddenly
landing
flat
his
feet
what
seemed
like
the
dazzling
light
Dumbledore
sunlit
office
The
stone
basin
was
shimmering
the
cabinet
front
him
and
Albus
Dumbledore
was
standing
beside
him
Professor
Harry
gasped
know
shouldn
didn
mean
the
cabinet
door
was
sort
open
and
quite
understand
said
Dumbledore
lifted
the
basin
carried
over
his
desk
placed
upon
the
polished
top
and
sat
down
the
chair
behind
motioned
for
Harry
sit
down
opposite
him
Harry
did
staring
the
stone
basin
The
contents
had
returned
their
original
silvery
white
state
swirling
and
rippling
beneath
his
gaze
What
Harry
asked
shakily
This
called
Pensieve
said
Dumbledore
sometimes
find
and
sure
you
know
the
feeling
that
simply
have
too
many
thoughts
and
memories
crammed
into
mind
said
Harry
who
couldn
truthfully
say
that
had
ever
felt
anything
the
sort
these
times
said
Dumbledore
indicating
the
stone
basin
use
the
Pensieve
One
simply
siphons
the
excess
thoughts
from
one
mind
pours
them
into
the
basin
and
examines
them
one
leisure
becomes
easier
spot
patterns
and
links
you
understand
when
they
are
this
form
You
mean
that
stuff
your
thoughts
Harry
said
staring
the
swirling
white
substance
the
basin
Certainly
said
Dumbledore
Let
show
you
Dumbledore
drew
his
wand
out
the
inside
his
robes
and
placed
the
tip
into
his
own
silvery
hair
near
his
temple
When
took
the
wand
away
hair
seemed
clinging
but
then
Harry
saw
that
was
fact
glistening
strand
the
same
strange
silvery
white
substance
that
filled
the
Pensieve
Dumbledore
added
this
fresh
thought
the
basin
and
Harry
astonished
saw
his
own
face
swimming
around
the
surface
the
bowl
Dumbledore
placed
his
long
hands
either
side
the
Pensieve
and
swirled
rather
gold
prospector
would
pan
for
fragments
gold
and
Harry
saw
his
own
face
change
smoothly
into
Snape
who
opened
his
mouth
and
spoke
the
ceiling
his
voice
echoing
slightly
coming
back
Karkaroff
too
stronger
and
clearer
than
ever
connection
could
have
made
without
assistance
Dumbledore
sighed
but
never
mind
peered
over
the
top
his
half
moon
spectacles
Harry
who
was
gaping
Snape
face
which
was
continuing
swirl
around
the
bowl
was
using
the
Pensieve
when
Fudge
arrived
for
our
meeting
and
put
away
rather
hastily
Undoubtedly
did
not
fasten
the
cabinet
door
properly
Naturally
would
have
attracted
your
attention
sorry
Harry
mumbled
Dumbledore
shook
his
head
Curiosity
not
sin
said
But
should
exercise
caution
with
our
curiosity
yes
indeed
Frowning
slightly
prodded
the
thoughts
within
the
basin
with
the
tip
his
wand
Instantly
figure
rose
out
plump
scowling
girl
about
sixteen
who
began
revolve
slowly
with
her
feet
still
the
basin
She
took
notice
whatsoever
Harry
Professor
Dumbledore
When
she
spoke
her
voice
echoed
Snape
had
done
though
were
coming
from
the
depths
the
stone
basin
put
hex
Professor
Dumbledore
and
was
only
teasing
him
sir
only
said
seen
him
kissing
Florence
behind
the
greenhouses
last
Thursday
But
why
Bertha
said
Dumbledore
sadly
looking
the
now
silently
revolving
girl
why
did
you
have
follow
him
the
first
place
Bertha
Harry
whispered
looking
her
that
was
that
Bertha
Jorkins
Yes
said
Dumbledore
prodding
the
thoughts
the
basin
again
Bertha
sank
back
into
them
and
they
became
silvery
and
opaque
once
more
That
was
Bertha
remember
her
school
The
silvery
light
from
the
Pensieve
illuminated
Dumbledore
face
and
struck
Harry
suddenly
how
very
old
was
looking
knew
course
that
Dumbledore
was
getting
years
but
somehow
never
really
thought
Dumbledore
old
man
Harry
said
Dumbledore
quietly
Before
you
got
lost
thoughts
you
wanted
tell
something
Yes
said
Harry
Professor
was
Divination
just
now
and
fell
asleep
hesitated
here
wondering
reprimand
was
coming
but
Dumbledore
merely
said
Quite
understandable
Continue
Well
had
dream
said
Harry
dream
about
Lord
Voldemort
was
torturing
Wormtail
you
know
who
Wormtail
know
said
Dumbledore
promptly
Please
continue
Voldemort
got
letter
from
owl
said
something
like
Wormtail
blunder
had
been
repaired
said
someone
was
dead
Then
said
Wormtail
wouldn
fed
the
snake
there
was
snake
beside
his
chair
said
said
feeding
instead
Then
did
the
Cruciatus
Curse
Wormtail
and
scar
hurt
Harry
said
woke
hurt
badly
Dumbledore
merely
looked
him
that
all
said
Harry
see
said
Dumbledore
quietly
see
Now
has
your
scar
hurt
any
other
time
this
year
excepting
the
time
woke
you
over
the
summer
how
did
you
know
woke
over
the
summer
said
Harry
astonished
You
are
not
Sirius
only
correspondent
said
Dumbledore
have
also
been
contact
with
him
ever
since
left
Hogwarts
last
year
was
who
suggested
the
mountainside
cave
the
safest
place
for
him
stay
Dumbledore
got
and
began
walking
and
down
behind
his
desk
Every
now
and
then
placed
his
wand
tip
his
temple
removed
another
shining
silver
thought
and
added
the
Pensieve
The
thoughts
inside
began
swirl
fast
that
Harry
couldn
make
out
anything
clearly
was
merely
blur
color
Professor
said
quietly
after
couple
minutes
Dumbledore
stopped
pacing
and
looked
Harry
apologies
said
quietly
sat
back
down
his
desk
you
you
know
why
scar
hurting
Dumbledore
looked
very
intently
Harry
for
moment
and
then
said
have
theory
more
than
that
belief
that
your
scar
hurts
both
when
Lord
Voldemort
near
you
and
when
feeling
particularly
strong
surge
hatred
But
why
Because
you
and
are
connected
the
curse
that
failed
said
Dumbledore
That
ordinary
scar
you
think
that
dream
did
really
happen
possible
said
Dumbledore
would
say
probable
Harry
did
you
see
Voldemort
said
Harry
Just
the
back
his
chair
But
there
wouldn
have
been
anything
see
would
there
mean
hasn
got
body
has
But
but
then
how
could
have
held
the
wand
Harry
said
slowly
How
indeed
muttered
Dumbledore
How
indeed
Neither
Dumbledore
nor
Harry
spoke
for
while
Dumbledore
was
gazing
across
the
room
and
every
now
and
then
placing
his
wand
tip
his
temple
and
adding
another
shining
silver
thought
the
seething
mass
within
the
Pensieve
Professor
Harry
said
last
you
think
getting
stronger
Voldemort
said
Dumbledore
looking
Harry
over
the
Pensieve
was
the
characteristic
piercing
look
Dumbledore
had
given
him
other
occasions
and
always
made
Harry
feel
though
Dumbledore
were
seeing
right
through
him
way
that
even
Moody
magical
eye
could
not
Once
again
Harry
can
only
give
you
suspicions
Dumbledore
sighed
again
and
looked
older
and
wearier
than
ever
The
years
Voldemort
ascent
power
said
were
marked
with
disappearances
Bertha
Jorkins
has
vanished
without
trace
the
place
where
Voldemort
was
certainly
known
last
Crouch
too
has
disappeared
within
these
very
grounds
And
there
was
third
disappearance
one
which
the
Ministry
regret
say
not
consider
any
importance
for
concerns
Muggle
His
name
was
Frank
Bryce
lived
the
village
where
Voldemort
father
grew
and
has
not
been
seen
since
last
August
You
see
read
the
Muggle
newspapers
unlike
most
Ministry
friends
Dumbledore
looked
very
seriously
Harry
These
disappearances
seem
linked
The
Ministry
disagrees
you
may
have
heard
while
waiting
outside
office
Harry
nodded
Silence
fell
between
them
again
Dumbledore
extracting
thoughts
every
now
and
then
Harry
felt
though
ought
but
his
curiosity
held
him
his
chair
Professor
said
again
Yes
Harry
said
Dumbledore
could
ask
you
about
that
court
thing
was
the
Pensieve
You
could
said
Dumbledore
heavily
attended
many
times
but
some
trials
come
back
more
clearly
than
others
particularly
now
You
know
you
know
the
trial
you
found
The
one
with
Crouch
son
Well
were
they
talking
about
Neville
parents
Dumbledore
gave
Harry
very
sharp
look
Has
Neville
never
told
you
why
has
been
brought
his
grandmother
said
Harry
shook
his
head
wondering
did
how
could
have
failed
ask
Neville
this
almost
four
years
knowing
him
Yes
they
were
talking
about
Nevilles
parents
said
Dumbledore
His
father
Frank
was
Auror
just
like
Professor
Moody
and
his
wife
were
tortured
for
information
about
Voldemort
whereabouts
after
lost
his
powers
you
heard
they
dead
said
Harry
quietly
said
Dumbledore
his
voice
full
bitterness
Harry
had
never
heard
there
before
They
are
insane
They
are
both
Mungo
Hospital
for
Magical
Maladies
and
Injuries
believe
Neville
visits
them
with
his
grandmother
during
the
holidays
They
not
recognize
him
Harry
sat
there
horror
struck
had
never
known
never
four
years
bothered
find
out
The
Longbottoms
were
very
popular
said
Dumbledore
The
attacks
them
came
after
Voldemort
fall
from
power
just
when
everyone
thought
they
were
safe
Those
attacks
caused
wave
fury
such
have
never
known
The
Ministry
was
under
great
pressure
catch
those
who
had
done
Unfortunately
the
Longbottoms
evidence
was
given
their
condition
none
too
reliable
Then
Crouch
son
might
not
have
been
involved
said
Harry
slowly
Dumbledore
shook
his
head
that
have
idea
Harry
sat
silence
once
more
watching
the
contents
the
Pensieve
swirl
There
were
two
more
questions
was
burning
ask
but
they
concerned
the
guilt
living
people
said
Bagman
has
never
been
accused
any
Dark
activity
since
said
Dumbledore
calmly
Right
said
Harry
hastily
staring
the
contents
the
Pensieve
again
which
were
swirling
more
slowly
now
that
Dumbledore
had
stopped
adding
thoughts
And
But
the
Pensieve
seemed
asking
his
question
for
him
Snape
face
was
swimming
the
surface
again
Dumbledore
glanced
down
into
and
then
Harry
more
has
Professor
Snape
said
Harry
looked
into
Dumbledore
light
blue
eyes
and
the
thing
really
wanted
know
spilled
out
his
mouth
before
could
stop
What
made
you
think
really
stopped
supporting
Voldemort
Professor
Dumbledore
held
Harrys
gaze
for
few
seconds
and
then
said
That
Harry
matter
between
Professor
Snape
and
myself
Harry
knew
that
the
interview
was
over
Dumbledore
did
not
look
angry
yet
there
was
finality
his
tone
that
told
Harry
was
time
stood
and
did
Dumbledore
Harry
said
Harry
reached
the
door
Please
not
speak
about
Neville
parents
anybody
else
has
the
right
let
people
know
when
ready
Yes
Professor
said
Harry
turning
And
Harry
looked
back
Dumbledore
was
standing
over
the
Pensieve
his
face
lit
from
beneath
its
silvery
spots
light
looking
older
than
ever
stared
Harry
for
moment
and
then
said
Good
luck
with
the
third
task
CHAPTER
THIRTY
ONE
THE
THIRD
TASK
Dumbledore
reckons
You
Know
Who
getting
stronger
again
well
Ron
whispered
Everything
Harry
had
seen
the
Pensieve
nearly
everything
Dumbledore
had
told
and
shown
him
afterward
had
now
shared
with
Ron
and
Hermione
and
course
with
Sirius
whom
Harry
had
sent
owl
the
moment
had
left
Dumbledore
office
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
late
the
common
room
once
again
that
night
talking
all
over
until
Harry
mind
was
reeling
until
understood
what
Dumbledore
had
meant
about
head
becoming
full
thoughts
that
would
have
been
relief
siphon
them
off
Ron
stared
into
the
common
room
fire
Harry
thought
saw
Ron
shiver
slightly
even
though
the
evening
was
warm
And
trusts
Snape
Ron
said
really
trusts
Snape
even
though
knows
was
Death
Eater
Yes
said
Harry
Hermione
had
not
spoken
for
ten
minutes
She
was
sitting
with
her
forehead
her
hands
staring
her
knees
Harry
thought
she
too
looked
though
she
could
have
done
with
Pensieve
Rita
Skeeter
she
muttered
finally
How
can
you
worrying
about
her
now
said
Ron
utter
disbelief
not
worrying
about
her
Hermione
said
her
knees
just
thinking
remember
what
she
said
the
Three
Broomsticks
know
things
about
Ludo
Bagman
that
would
make
your
hair
curl
This
what
she
meant
isn
She
reported
his
trial
she
knew
passed
information
the
Death
Eaters
And
Winky
too
remember
Ludo
Bagman
bad
wizard
Crouch
would
have
been
furious
got
off
would
have
talked
about
home
Yeah
but
Bagman
didn
pass
information
purpose
did
Hermione
shrugged
And
Fudge
reckons
Madame
Maxime
attacked
Crouch
Ron
said
turning
back
Harry
Yeah
said
Harry
but
only
saying
that
because
Crouch
disappeared
near
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
never
thought
her
did
said
Ron
slowly
Mind
you
she
definitely
got
giant
blood
and
she
doesn
want
admit
course
she
doesn
said
Hermione
sharply
looking
Look
what
happened
Hagrid
when
Rita
found
out
about
his
mother
Look
Fudge
jumping
conclusions
about
her
just
because
she
part
giant
Who
needs
that
sort
prejudice
probably
say
had
big
bones
knew
that
what
get
for
telling
the
truth
Hermione
looked
her
watch
haven
done
any
practicing
she
said
looking
shocked
were
going
the
Impediment
Curse
have
really
get
down
tomorrow
Come
Harry
you
need
get
some
sleep
Harry
and
Ron
went
slowly
upstairs
their
dormitory
Harry
pulled
his
pajamas
looked
over
Nevilles
bed
True
his
word
Dumbledore
had
not
told
Ron
and
Hermione
about
Neville
parents
Harry
took
off
his
glasses
and
climbed
into
his
four
poster
imagined
how
must
feel
have
parents
still
living
but
unable
recognize
you
often
got
sympathy
from
strangers
for
being
orphan
but
listened
Nevilles
snores
thought
that
Neville
deserved
more
than
did
Lying
the
darkness
Harry
felt
rush
anger
and
hate
toward
the
people
who
had
tortured
and
Mrs
Longbottom
remembered
the
jeers
the
crowd
Crouch
son
and
his
companions
had
been
dragged
from
the
court
the
dementors
understood
how
they
had
felt
Then
remembered
the
milk
white
face
the
screaming
boy
and
realized
with
jolt
that
had
died
year
later
was
Voldemort
Harry
thought
staring
the
canopy
his
bed
the
darkness
all
came
back
Voldemort
was
the
one
who
had
torn
these
families
apart
who
had
ruined
all
these
lives
Ron
and
Hermione
were
supposed
studying
for
their
exams
which
would
finish
the
day
the
third
task
but
they
were
putting
most
their
efforts
into
helping
Harry
prepare
Don
worry
about
Hermione
said
shortly
when
Harry
pointed
this
out
them
and
said
didn
mind
practicing
his
own
for
while
least
get
top
marks
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
never
have
found
out
about
all
these
hexes
class
Good
training
for
when
all
Aurors
said
Ron
excitedly
attempting
the
Impediment
Curse
wasp
that
had
buzzed
into
the
room
and
making
stop
dead
midair
The
mood
the
castle
they
entered
June
became
excited
and
tense
again
Everyone
was
looking
forward
the
third
task
which
would
take
place
week
before
the
end
term
Harry
was
practicing
hexes
every
available
moment
felt
more
confident
about
this
task
than
either
the
others
Difficult
and
dangerous
though
would
undoubtedly
Moody
was
right
Harry
had
managed
find
his
way
past
monstrous
creatures
and
enchanted
barriers
before
now
and
this
time
had
some
notice
some
chance
prepare
himself
for
what
lay
ahead
Tired
walking
Harry
Hermione
and
Ron
all
over
the
school
Professor
McGonagall
had
given
them
permission
use
the
empty
Transfiguration
classroom
lunchtimes
Harry
had
soon
mastered
the
Impediment
Curse
spell
slow
down
and
obstruct
attackers
the
Reductor
Curse
which
would
enable
him
blast
solid
objects
out
his
way
and
the
Four
Point
Spell
useful
discovery
Hermiones
that
would
make
his
wand
point
due
north
therefore
enabling
him
check
whether
was
going
the
right
direction
within
the
maze
was
still
having
trouble
with
the
Shield
Charm
though
This
was
supposed
cast
temporary
invisible
wall
around
himself
that
deflected
minor
curses
Hermione
managed
shatter
with
well
placed
Jelly
Legs
Jinx
and
Harry
wobbled
around
the
room
for
ten
minutes
afterward
before
she
had
looked
the
counter
jinx
You
still
doing
really
well
though
Hermione
said
encouragingly
looking
down
her
list
and
crossing
off
those
spells
they
had
already
learned
Some
these
are
bound
come
handy
Come
and
look
this
said
Ron
who
was
standing
the
window
was
staring
down
onto
the
grounds
What
Malfoy
doing
Harry
and
Hermione
went
see
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
standing
the
shadow
tree
below
Crabbe
and
Goyle
seemed
keeping
lookout
both
were
smirking
Malfoy
was
holding
his
hand
his
mouth
and
speaking
into
looks
like
using
walkie
talkie
said
Harry
curiously
can
said
Hermione
told
you
those
sorts
things
don
work
around
Hogwarts
Come
Harry
she
added
briskly
turning
away
from
the
window
and
moving
back
into
the
middle
the
room
let
try
that
Shield
Charm
again
Sirius
was
sending
daily
owls
now
Like
Hermione
seemed
want
concentrate
getting
Harry
through
the
last
task
before
they
concerned
themselves
with
anything
else
reminded
Harry
every
letter
that
whatever
might
going
outside
the
walls
Hogwarts
was
not
Harry
responsibility
nor
was
within
his
power
influence
Voldemort
really
getting
stronger
again
wrote
priority
ensure
your
safety
cannot
hope
lay
hands
you
while
you
are
under
Dumbledore
protection
but
all
the
same
take
risks
Concentrate
getting
through
that
maze
safely
and
then
can
turn
our
attention
other
matters
Harry
nerves
mounted
June
the
twenty
fourth
drew
closer
but
they
were
not
bad
those
had
felt
before
the
first
and
second
tasks
For
one
thing
was
confident
that
this
time
had
done
everything
his
power
prepare
for
the
task
For
another
this
was
the
final
hurdle
and
however
well
badly
did
the
tournament
would
last
over
which
would
enormous
relief
Breakfast
was
very
noisy
affair
the
Gryffindor
table
the
morning
the
third
task
The
post
owls
appeared
bringing
Harry
good
luck
card
from
Sirius
was
only
piece
parchment
folded
over
and
bearing
muddy
paw
print
its
front
but
Harry
appreciated
all
the

Parseltongue

Draco
Malfoy
Hogwarts
fourth
year
There
were
lot
attacks
students
couple
years
ago
and
most
people
thought
Potter
was
behind
them
after
they
saw
him
lose
his

and
set
snake
another
boy

all
hushed

But

Parseltongue
the
ability

has
long
been

Indeed
the

none

than
You

that
would
regard
any

Parseltongue
worthy
investigation
Personally
would
highly
suspicious
anybody
who
could
converse
with
snakes
serpents
are
often
used
the
worst
kinds
Dark
Magic
and
are
historically
associated
with
evildoers
Similarly
anyone
who
seeks
out
the
company
such
vicious
creatures
werewolves
and
giants
would
appear
have
fondness
for
violence
Albus
Dumbledore
should
surely
consider
whether
boy
such

fear
that

this

Harry
lightly
folding
the

Over

table
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
laughing
him
tapping
their
heads
with
their
fingers
pulling
grotesquely
mad

and
waggling
their

like

How

Harry
You

Hermione
But

odd
dreamy
expression
suddenly
came
over
Hermione
face
She
slowly
raised
hand
and
ran
her
fingers
through
her
hair
Are
you
all
right
said
Ron
frowning
her
Yes
said
Hermione
breathlessly
She
ran
her
fingers
through
her
hair
again
and
then
held
her
hand
her
mouth
though
speaking
into
invisible
walkie

Harry
and
Ron
stared

just
then
Professor

Ron

walked
across

and
opened
the

into
the
chamber
Cedric
and
his
parents
were
just
inside

Viktor
Krum

Gabrielle
was
holding

She

Then
saw
Mrs

and
Bill
standing
front
the
fireplace
beaming
him
Surprise
Mrs

said
excitedly
smiled
broadly
and
walked
over
them
Thought

She
bent

Harry
muttered
Mrs

thought
for
moment
the
Dursleys
Hmm
said
Mrs
Weasley
pursing
her
lips
She
had
always
refrained
from
criticizing
the
Dursleys
front
Harry
but
her
eyes
flashed
every
time
they
were
mentioned
great
being
back
here
said
Bill
looking
around
the
chamber
Violet
the
Fat
Lady
friend
winked
him
from
her
frame
Haven

place
for
five

Bill
She

Mrs

such
telling
off
one
night
when

the
morning

Harry
and
they
made
their
way
back
toward
the

into
the
Great
Hall
they
passed
Amos
Diggory
looked
around
There

quite
full

What

Harry
Ignore

Cedric

Harry
frowning
after
his

angry
ever
since

Triwizard

when
she
made

only
Hogwarts

said
Amos

loudly
enough
for
Harry
hear

walk
out

door
with
Mrs

and
Bill
Still

Beaten

Amos
Mrs

angrily

thought

that
working
the
Ministry
Diggory
looked
though
was
going
say
something
angry
but
his
wife
laid
hand
his
arm
and
merely
shrugged
and
turned
away
Harry
had
very
enjoyable
morning
walking
over
the
sunny
grounds
with
Bill
and
Mrs
Weasley
showing
them
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
and
the
Durmstrang
ship
Mrs
Weasley
was
intrigued
the
Whomping
Willow
which
had
been
planted
after
she
had
left
school
and
reminisced
length
about
the
gamekeeper
before
Hagrid
man
called
Ogg
How
Percy
Harry
asked
they
walked
around
the
greenhouses
Not
good
said
Bill
very
upset
said
Mrs
Weasley
lowering
her
voice
and
glancing
around
The
Ministry

quiet
but
Percy

hauled
for
questioning
about

They

They

castle
for
lunch
Mum
Bill
said
Ron
looking
stunned
joined
the
Gryffindor
table
What

here
Come

Harry

last
task
said
Mrs
Weasley
brightly
must
say
makes
lovely
change
not
having
cook
How

your
exam

said
Ron
Couldn
remember
all
the
goblin
rebels

said
helping
himself
Cornish
pasty
while
Mrs
Weasley
looked
stern
they
all
called
stuff
like
Bodrod
the
Bearded
and
Urg
the
Unclean
wasn
hard
Fred
George
and
Ginny
came
sit
next
them
too
and
Harry
was
having
such
good
time
felt
almost
though
were
back
the
Burrow
had
forgotten
worry
about
that
evening
task
and
not
until
Hermione
turned
halfway
through
lunch
did
remember
that
she
had
had
brainwave
about
Rita
Skeeter
Are
you
going
tell
Hermione
shook
her
head
warningly
and
glanced
Mrs
Weasley
Hello
Hermione
said
Mrs
Weasley
much
more
stiffly
than
usual
Hello
said
Hermione
her
smile
faltering
the
cold
expression
Mrs
Weasley
face
Harry
looked
between
them
then
said
Mrs
Weasley
you
didn
believe
that
rubbish
Rita
Skeeter
wrote
Witch
Weekly
did
you
Because
Hermione
not
girlfriend
said
Mrs
Weasley
course
didn
But
she
became
considerably
warmer
toward
Hermione
after
that
Harry
Bill
and
Mrs
Weasley
whiled
away
the
afternoon
with
long
walk
around
the
castle
and
then
returned
the
Great
Hall
for
the
evening
feast
Ludo
Bagman
and
Cornelius
Fudge
had
joined
the
staff
table
now
Bagman
looked
quite
cheerful
but
Cornelius
Fudge
who
was
sitting
next
Madame
Maxime
looked
stern
and
was
not
talking
Madame
Maxime
was
concentrating
her
plate
and
Harry
thought
her
eyes
looked
red
Hagrid
kept
glancing
along
the
table
her
There
were
more
courses
than
usual
but
Harry
who
was
starting
feel
really
nervous
now
didn
eat
much
the
enchanted
ceiling
overhead
began
fade
from
blue
dusky
purple
Dumbledore
rose
his
feet
the
staff
table
and
silence
fell
Ladies
and
gentlemen
five
minutes
time
will
asking
you
make
your
way
down
the
Quidditch
field
for
the
third
and
final
task
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Will
the
champions
please
follow
Bagman
down
the
stadium
now
Harry
got
The
Gryffindors
all
along
the
table
were
applauding
him
the
Weasleys
and
Hermione
all
wished
him
good
luck
and
headed
off
out
the
Great
Hall
with
Cedric
Fleur
and
Viktor
Feeling
all
right
Harry
Bagman
asked
they
went
down
the
stone
steps
onto
the
grounds
Confident
okay
said
Harry
was
sort
true
was
nervous
but
kept
running
over
all
the
hexes
and
spells
had
been
practicing
his
mind
they
walked
and
the
knowledge
that
could
remember
them
all
made
him
feel
better
They
walked
onto
the
Quidditch
field
which
was
now
completely
unrecognizable
twenty
foot
high
hedge
ran
all
the
way
around
the
edge
There
was
gap
right
front
them
the
entrance
the
vast
maze
The
passage
beyond
looked
dark
and
creepy
Five
minutes
later
the
stands
had
begun
fill
the
air
was
full
excited
voices
and
the
rumbling
feet
the
hundreds
students
filed
into
their
seats
The
sky
was
deep
clear
blue
now
and
the
first
stars
were
starting
appear
Hagrid
Professor
Moody
Professor
McGonagall
and
Professor
Flitwick
came
walking
into
the
stadium
and
approached
Bagman
and
the
champions
They
were
wearing
large
red
luminous
stars
their
hats
all
except
Hagrid
who
had
his
the
back
his
moleskin
vest
are
going
patrolling
the
outside
the
maze
said
Professor
McGonagall
the
champions
you
get
into
difficulty
and
wish
rescued
send
red
sparks
into
the
air
and
one
will
come
and
get
you
you
understand
The
champions
nodded
Off
you
then
said
Bagman
brightly
the
four
patrollers
Good
luck
Harry
Hagrid
whispered
and
the
four
them
walked
away
different
directions
station
themselves
around
the
maze
Bagman
now
pointed
his
wand
his
throat
muttered
Sonorus
and
his
magically
magnified
voice
echoed
into
the
stands
Ladies
and
gentlemen
the
third
and
final
task
the
Triwizard
Tournament
about
begin
Let
remind
you
how
the
points

Cedric
Diggory
and
Harry
Potter
both
Hogwarts
School
The
cheers
and
applause
sent
birds
from
the
Forbidden
Forest
fluttering
into
the
darkening

eighty
points
Viktor
Krum
Durmstrang
Institute
More

Miss
Fleur
Delacour
Beauxbatons
Academy
Harry
could
just
make
out
Mrs
Weasley
Bill
Ron
and
Hermione
applauding
Fleur
politely
halfway
the
stands
waved
them
and
they
waved
back
beaming
him
whistle
Harry
and
Cedric
said
Bagman
Three
two
one
gave
short
blast
his
whistle
and
Harry
and
Cedric
hurried
forward
into
the
maze
The
towering
hedges
cast
black
shadows
across
the
path
and
whether
because
they
were
tall
and
thick
because
they
had
been
enchanted
the
sound
the
surrounding
crowd
was
silenced
the
moment
they
entered
the
maze
Harry
felt
almost
though
were
underwater
again
pulled
out
his
wand
muttered
Lumos
and
heard
Cedric
the
same
just
behind
him
After
about
fifty
yards
they
reached
fork
They
looked
each
other
See
you
Harry
said
and
took
the
left
one
while
Cedric
took
the
right
Harry
heard
Bagman
whistle
for
the
second
time
Krum
had
entered
the
maze
Harry
sped
His
chosen
path
seemed
completely
deserted
turned
right
and
hurried
holding
his
wand
high
over
his
head
trying
see
far
ahead
possible
Still
there
was
nothing
sight
Bagman
whistle
blew
the
distance
for
the
third
time
All
the
champions
were
now
inside
Harry
kept
looking
behind
him
The
old
feeling
that
was
being
watched
was
upon
him
The
maze
was
growing
darker
with
every
passing
minute
the
sky
overhead
deepened
navy
reached
second
fork
Point
whispered
his
wand
holding
flat
his
palm
The
wand
spun
around
once
and
pointed
toward
his
right
into
solid
hedge
That
way
was
north
and
knew
that
needed
northwest
for
the
center
the
maze
The
best
could
was
take
the
left
fork
and
right
again
soon
possible
The
path
ahead
was
empty
too
and
when
Harry
reached
right
turn
and
took
again
found
his
way
unblocked
Harry
didn
know
why
but
the
lack
obstacles
was
unnerving
him
Surely
should
have
met
something
now
felt
though
the
maze
were
luring
him
into
false
sense
security
Then
heard
movement
right
behind
him
held
out
his
wand
ready
attack
but
its
beam
fell
only
upon
Cedric
who
had
just
hurried
out
path
the
right
hand
side
Cedric
looked
severely
shaken
The
sleeve
his
robe
was
smoking
Hagrid
Blast
Ended
Skrewts
hissed
They
enormous
only
just
got
away
shook
his
head
and
dived
out
sight
along
another
path
Keen
put
plenty
distance
between
himself
and
the
skrewts
Harry
hurried
off
again
Then
turned
corner
saw
dementor
gliding
toward
him
Twelve
feet
tall
its
face
hidden
its
hood
its
rotting
scabbed
hands
outstretched
advanced
sensing
its
way
blindly
toward
him
Harry
could
hear
its
rattling
breath
felt
clammy
coldness
stealing
over
him
but
knew
what
had
summoned
the
happiest
thought
could
concentrated
with
all
his
might
the
thought
getting
out
the
maze
and
celebrating
with
Ron
and
Hermione
raised
his
wand
and
cried
Expecto
Patronum
silver
stag
erupted
from
the
end
Harry
wand
and
galloped
toward
the
dementor
which
fell
back
and
tripped
over
the
hem
its
robes
Harry
had
never
seen
dementor
stumble
Hang
shouted
advancing
the
wake
his
silver
Patronus
You
boggart
Riddikulus
There
was
loud
crack
and
the
shape
shifter
exploded
wisp
smoke
The
silver
stag
faded
from
sight
Harry
wished
could
have
stayed
could
have
used
some
company
but
moved
quickly
and
quietly
possible
listening
hard
his
wand
held
high
once
more
Left
right
left
again
Twice
found
himself
facing
dead
ends
did
the
Four
Point
Spell
again
and
found
that
was
going
too
far
east
turned
back
took
right
turn
and
saw
odd
golden
mist
floating
ahead
him
Harry
approached
cautiously
pointing
the
wand
beam
This
looked
like
some
kind
enchantment
wondered
whether
might
able
blast
out
the
way
Reducio
said
The
spell
shot
straight
through
the
mist
leaving
intact
supposed
should
have
known
better
the
Reductor
Curse
was
for
solid
objects
What
would
happen
walked
through
the
mist
Was
worth
chancing
should
double
back
was
still
hesitating
when
scream
shattered
the
silence
Fleur
Harry
yelled
There
was
silence
stared
all
around
him
What
had
happened
her
Her
scream
seemed
have
come
from
somewhere
ahead
took
deep
breath
and
ran
through
the
enchanted
mist
The
world
turned
upside
down
Harry
was
hanging
from
the
ground
with
his
hair
end
his
glasses
dangling
off
his
nose
threatening
fall
into
the
bottomless
sky
clutched
them
the
end
his
nose
and
hung
there
terrified
felt
though
his
feet
were
glued
the
grass
which
had
now
become
the
ceiling
Below
him
the
dark
star
spangled
heavens
stretched
endlessly
felt
though
tried
move
one
his
feet
would
fall
away
from
the
earth
completely
Think
told
himself
all
the
blood
rushed
his
head
think
But
not
one
the
spells
had
practiced
had
been
designed
combat
sudden
reversal
ground
and
sky
Did
dare
move
his
foot
could
hear
the
blood
pounding
his
ears
had
two
choices
try
and
move
send
red
sparks
and
get
rescued
and
disqualified
from
the
task
shut
his
eyes
wouldn
able
see
the
view
endless
space
below
him
and
pulled
his
right
foot
hard
could
away
from
the
grassy
ceiling
Immediately
the
world
righted
itself
Harry
fell
forward
onto
his
knees
onto
the
wonderfully
solid
ground
felt
temporarily
limp
with
shock
took
deep
steadying
breath
then
got
again
and
hurried
forward
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
ran
away
from
the
golden
mist
which
twinkled
innocently
him
the
moonlight
paused
junction
two
paths
and
looked
around
for
some
sign
Fleur
was
sure
had
been
she
who
had
screamed
What
had
she
met
Was
she
all
right
There
was
sign
red
sparks
did
that
mean
she
had
got
herself
out
trouble
was
she
such
trouble
that
she
couldn
reach
her
wand
Harry
took
the
right
fork
with
feeling
increasing
unease
but
the
same
time
couldn
help
thinking
One
champion
down
The
cup
was
somewhere
close
and
sounded
though
Fleur
was
longer
the
running
got
this
far
hadn
What
actually
managed
win
Fleetingly
and
for
the
first
time
since
found
himself
champion
saw
again
that
image
himself
raising
the
Triwizard
Cup
front
the
rest
the
school
met
nothing
for
ten
minutes
but
kept
running
into
dead
ends
Twice
took
the
same
wrong
turning
Finally
found
new
route
and
started
jog
along
his
wandlight
waving
making
his
shadow
flicker
and
distort
the
hedge
walls
Then
rounded
another
corner
and
found
himself
facing
Blast
Ended
Skrewt
Cedric
was
right
was
enormous
Ten
feet
long
looked
more
like
giant
scorpion
than
anything
Its
long
sting
was
curled
over
its
back
Its
thick
armor
glinted
the
light
from
Harry
wand
which
pointed
Stupefy
The
spell
hit
the
skrewt
armor
and
rebounded
Harry
ducked
just
time
but
could
smell
burning
hair
had
singed
the
top
his
head
The
skrewt
issued
blast
fire
from
its
end
and
flew
forward
toward
him
Impedimenta
Harry
yelled
The
spell
hit
the
skrewt
armor
again
and
ricocheted
off
Harry
staggered
back
few
paces
and
fell
over
IMPEDIMENTA
The
skrewt
was
inches
from
him
when
froze
had
managed
hit
its
fleshy
shell
less
underside
Panting
Harry
pushed
himself
away
from
and
ran
hard
the
opposite
direction
the
Impediment
Curse
was
not
permanent
the
skrewt
would
regaining
the
use
its
legs
any
moment
took
left
path
and
hit
dead
end
right
and
hit
another
forcing
himself
stop
heart
hammering
performed
the
Four
Point
Spell
again
backtracked
and
chose
path
that
would
take
him
northwest
had
been
hurrying
along
the
new
path
for
few
minutes
when
heard
something
the
path
running
parallel
his
own
that
made
him
stop
dead
What
are
you
doing
yelled
Cedric
voice
What
the
hell
you
think
you
doing
And
then
Harry
heard
Krum
voice
Crucio
The
air
was
suddenly
full
Cedric
yells
Horrified
Harry
began
sprinting
his
path
trying
find
way
into
Cedric
When
none
appeared
tried
the
Reductor
Curse
again
wasn
very
effective
but
burned
small
hole
the
hedge
through
which
Harry
forced
his
leg
kicking
the
thick
brambles
and
branches
until
they
broke
and
made
opening
struggled
through
tearing
his
robes
and
looking
his
right
saw
Cedric
jerking
and
twitching
the
ground
Krum
standing
over
him
Harry
pulled
himself
and
pointed
his
wand
Krum
just
Krum
looked
Krum
turned
and
began
run
Stupefy
Harry
yelled
The
spell
hit
Krum
the
back
stopped
dead
his
tracks
fell
forward
and
lay
motionless
facedown
the
grass
Harry
dashed
over
Cedric
who
had
stopped
twitching
and
was
lying
there
panting
his
hands
over
his
face
Are
you
all
right
Harry
said
roughly
grabbing
Cedric
arm
Yeah
panted
Cedric
Yeah
don
believe
crept
behind
heard
him
turned
around
and
had
his
wand
Cedric
got
was
still
shaking
and
Harry
looked
down
Krum
can
believe
this
thought
was
all
right
Harry
said
staring
Krum
did
said
Cedric
Did
you
hear
Fleur
scream
earlier
said
Harry
Yeah
said
Cedric
You
don
think
Krum
got
her
too
don
know
said
Harry
slowly
Should
leave
him
here
Cedric
muttered
said
Harry
reckon
should
send
red
sparks
Someone
come
and
collect
him
otherwise
probably
eaten
skrewt
deserve
Cedric
muttered
but
all
the
same
raised
his
wand
and
shot
shower
red
sparks
into
the
air
which
hovered
high
above
Krum
marking
the
spot
where
lay
Harry
and
Cedric
stood
there
the
darkness
for
moment
looking
around
them
Then
Cedric
said
Well
pose
better
What
said
Harry
yeah
right
was
odd
moment
and
Cedric
had
been
briefly
united
against
Krum
now
the
fact
that
they
were
opponents
came
back
Harry
The
two
them
proceeded
the
dark
path
without
speaking
then
Harry
turned
left
and
Cedric
right
Cedric
footsteps
soon
died
away
Harry
moved
continuing
use
the
Four
Point
Spell
making
sure
was
moving
the
right
direction
was
between
him
and
Cedric
now
His
desire
reach
the
cup
first
was
now
burning
stronger
than
ever
but
could
hardly
believe
what
just
seen
Krum
The
use
Unforgivable
Curse
fellow
human
being
meant
life
term
Azkaban
that
was
what
Moody
had
told
them
Krum
surely
couldn
have
wanted
the
Triwizard
Cup
that
badly
Harry
sped
Every
often
hit
more
dead
ends
but
the
increasing
darkness
made
him
feel
sure
was
getting
near
the
heart
the
maze
Then
strode
down
long
straight
path
saw
movement
once
again
and
his
beam
wandlight
hit
extraordinary
creature
one
which
had
only
seen
picture
form
his
Monster
Book
Monsters
was
sphinx
had
the
body
over
large
lion
great
clawed
paws
and
long
yellowish
tail
ending
brown
tuft
Its
head
however
was
that
woman
She
turned
her
long
almond
shaped
eyes
upon
Harry
approached
raised
his
wand
hesitating
She
was
not
crouching
spring
but
pacing
from
side
side
the
path
blocking
his
progress
Then
she
spoke
deep
hoarse
voice
You
are
very
near
your
goal
The
quickest
way
past
will
you
move
please
said
Harry
knowing
what
the
answer
was
going
she
said
continuing
pace
Not

first
guess

you
pass

Harry
stomach
slipped
several
notches
was
Hermione
who
was
good
this
sort
thing
not
him
weighed
his
chances
the
riddle
was
too
hard
could
keep
silent
get
away
from
the
sphinx
unharmed
and
try
and
find
alternative
route
the
center
Okay
said
Can
hear
the
riddle
The
sphinx
sat
down
upon
her
hind
legs
the
very
middle
the
path
and
recited
First

person
who
lives

Who
deals
secrets
and
tells
naught
but
lies
Next

what
always
the
last
thing

And
finally
give
the
sound
often
heard
During
the
search
for
hard
find
word
Now

them
together
and
answer
this
Which
creature
would

unwilling
kiss
Harry
gaped
her
Could

asked
tentatively
She
blinked
him
smiled
and
repeated
the
poem
All

clues

want
kiss
Harry
asked
She
merely
smiled
her
mysterious
smile
Harry
took
that
for
yes
Harry
cast
his
mind
around
There
were
plenty
animals
wouldn
want
kiss
his
immediate
thought
was
Blast
Ended

but
something
told
him
that

the
answer

She

lines

Harry
repeated
idea

have
the
last
bit

She
gave
him
the

four
lines
The
sound

heard
during
the
search
for
hard

said
Harry
that

The

smiled

Harry
pacing

The
sphinx
smiled
more
broadly
She
got
stretched
her
front
legs
and
then
moved
aside
for
him
pass
Thanks
said
Harry
and
amazed
his
own
brilliance
dashed
forward
had
close
now
had
His
wand
was
telling
him
was
bang
course
long
didn
meet
anything
too
horrible
might
have
chance
Harry
broke
into
run
had
choice
paths
ahead
Point
whispered
again
his
wand
and
spun
around
and
pointed
him
the
right
hand
one
dashed
this
one
and
saw
light
ahead
The
Triwizard
Cup
was
gleaming
plinth
hundred
yards
away
Suddenly
dark
figure
hurtled
out
onto
the
path
front
him
Cedric
was
going
get
there
first
Cedric
was
sprinting
fast
could
toward
the
cup
and
Harry
knew
would
never
catch
Cedric
was
much
taller
had
much
longer
legs
Then
Harry
saw
something
immense
over
hedge
his
left
moving
quickly
along
path
that
intersected
with
his
own
was
moving
fast
Cedric
was
about
run
into
and
Cedric
his
eyes
the
cup
had
not
seen
Cedric
Harry
bellowed
your
left
Cedric
looked
around
just
time
hurl
himself
past
the
thing
and
avoid
colliding
with
but
his
haste
tripped
Harry
saw
Cedric
wand
fly
out
his
hand
gigantic
spider
stepped
into
the
path
and
began
bear
down
upon
Cedric
Stupefy
Harry
yelled
the
spell
hit
the
spider
gigantic
hairy
black
body
but
for
all
the
good
did
might
well
have
thrown
stone
the
spider
jerked
scuttled
around
and
ran
Harry
instead
Stupefy
Impedimenta
Stupefy
But
was
use
the
spider
was
either
large
magical
that
the
spells
were
doing
more
than
aggravating
Harry
had
one
horrifying
glimpse
eight
shining
black
eyes
and
razor
sharp
pincers
before
was
upon
him
was
lifted
into
the
air
its
front
legs
struggling
madly
tried
kick
his
leg
connected
with
the
pincers
and
next
moment
was
excruciating
pain
could
hear
Cedric
yelling
Stupefy
too
but
his
spell
had
more
effect
than
Harry
Harry
raised
his
wand
the
spider
opened
its
pincers
once
more
and
shouted
Expelliarmus
worked
the
Disarming
Spell
made
the
spider
drop
him
but
that
meant
that
Harry
fell
twelve
feet
onto
his
already
injured
leg
which
crumpled
beneath
him
Without
pausing
think
aimed
high
the
spider
underbelly
had
done
with
the
skrewt
and
shouted
Stupefy
just
Cedric
yelled
the
same
thing
The
two
spells
combined
did
what
one
alone
had
not
The
spider
keeled
over
sideways
flattening
nearby
hedge
and
strewing
the
path
with
tangle
hairy
legs
Harry
heard
Cedric
shouting
You
all
right
Did
fall
you
Harry
called
back
panting
looked
down
his
leg
was
bleeding
freely
could
see
some
sort
thick
gluey
secretion
from
the
spider
pincers
his
torn
robes
tried
get
but
his
leg
was
shaking
badly
and
did
not
want
support
his
weight
leaned
against
the
hedge
gasping
for
breath
and
looked
around
Cedric
was
standing
feet
from
the
Triwizard
Cup
which
was
gleaming
behind
him
Take
then
Harry
panted
Cedric
take
You
there
But
Cedric
didn
move
merely
stood
there
looking
Harry
Then
turned
stare
the
cup
Harry
saw
the
longing
expression
his
face
its
golden
light
Cedric
looked
around
Harry
again
who
was
now
holding
onto
the
hedge
support
himself
Cedric
took
deep
breath
You
take
You
should
win
That
twice
you
saved
neck
here
That
not
how
supposed
work
Harry
said
felt
angry
his
leg
was
very
painful
was
aching
all
over
from
trying
throw
off
the
spider
and
after
all
his
efforts
Cedric
had
beaten
him
just
beaten
Harry
ask
Cho
the
ball
The
one
who
reaches
the
cup
first
gets
the
points
That
you
telling
you
not
going
win
any
races
this
leg
Cedric
took
few
paces
nearer
the
Stunned
spider
away
from
the
cup
shaking
his
head
said
Stop
being
noble
said
Harry
irritably
Just
take
then
can
get
out
here
Cedric
watched
Harry
steadying
himself
holding
tight
the
hedge
You
told
about
the
dragons
Cedric
said
would
gone
down
the
first
task
you
hadn
told
what
was
coming
had
help
that
too
Harry
snapped
trying
mop
his
bloody
leg
with
his
robes
You
helped
with
the
egg
square
had
help
the
egg
the
first
place
said
Cedric
still
square
said
Harry
testing
his
leg
gingerly
shook
violently
put
weight
had
sprained
his
ankle
when
the
spider
had
dropped
him
You
should
got
more
points

second
task
said
Cedric
mulishly
You
stayed
behind
get
all
the
hostages
should
done
that
was
the
only
one
who
was
thick
enough
take
that
song
seriously
said
Harry
bitterly
Just
take
the
cup
said
Cedric
stepped
over
the
spider
tangled
legs
join
Harry
who
stared
him
Cedric
was
serious
was
walking
away
from
the
sort
glory
Hufflepuff
House
hadn
had
centuries
Cedric
said
looked
though
this
was
costing
him
every
ounce
resolution
had
but
his
face
was
set
his
arms
were
folded
seemed
decided
Harry
looked
from
Cedric
the
cup
For
one
shining
moment
saw
himself
emerging
from
the
maze
holding
saw
himself
holding
the
Triwizard
Cup
aloft
heard
the
roar
the
crowd
saw
Cho
face
shining
with
admiration
more
clearly
than
had
ever
seen
before
and
then
the
picture
faded
and
found
himself
staring
Cedric
shadowy
stubborn
face
Both
Harry
said
What
take
the
same
time
still
Hogwarts
victory
tie
for
Cedric
stared
Harry
unfolded
his
arms
You
you
sure
Yeah
said
Harry
Yeah
helped
each
other
out
haven
both
got
here
Let
just
take
together
For
moment
Cedric
looked
though
couldn
believe
his
ears
then
his
face
split
grin
You
said
Come
here
grabbed
Harrys
arm
below
the
shoulder
and
helped
Harry
limp
toward
the
plinth
where
the
cup
stood
When
they
had
reached
they
both
held
hand
out
over
one
the
cup
gleaming
handles
three
right
said
Harry
One
two
three
and
Cedric
both
grasped
handle
Instantly
Harry
felt
jerk
somewhere
behind
his
navel
His
feet
had
left
the
ground
could
not
unclench
the
hand
holding
the
Triwizard
Cup
was
pulling
him
onward
howl
wind
and
swirling
color
Cedric
his
side
CHAPTER
THIRTY
TWO
FLESH
BLOOD
AND
BONE
Harry
felt
his
feet
slam
into
the
ground
his
injured
leg
gave
way
and
fell
forward
his
hand
let
the
Triwizard
Cup
last
raised
his
head
Where
are
said
Cedric
shook
his
head
got
pulled
Harry
his
feet
and
they
looked
around
They
had
left
the
Hogwarts
grounds
completely
they
had
obviously
traveled
miles
perhaps
hundreds
miles
for
even
the
mountains
surrounding
the
castle
were
gone
They
were
standing
instead
dark
and
overgrown
graveyard
the
black
outline
small
church
was
visible
beyond
large
yew
tree
their
right
hill
rose
above
them
their
left
Harry
could
just
make
out
the
outline
fine
old
house
the
hillside
Cedric
looked
down
the
Triwizard
Cup
and
then
Harry
Did
anyone
tell
you
the
cup
was
Portkey
asked
Nope
said
Harry
was
looking
around
the
graveyard
was
completely
silent
and
slightly
eerie
this
supposed
part
the
task
dunno
said
Cedric
sounded
slightly
nervous
Wands
out
you
reckon
Yeah
said
Harry
glad
that
Cedric
had
made
the
suggestion
rather
than
him
They
pulled
out
their
wands
Harry
kept
looking
around
him
had
yet
again
the
strange
feeling
that
they
were
being
watched
Someone
coming
said
suddenly
Squinting
tensely
through
the
darkness
they
watched
the
figure
drawing
nearer
walking
steadily
toward
them
between
the
graves
Harry
couldn
make
out
face
but
from
the
way
was
walking
and
holding
its
arms
could
tell
that
was
carrying
something
Whoever
was
was
short
and
wearing
hooded
cloak
pulled
over
his
head
obscure
his
face
And
several
paces
nearer
the
gap
between
them
closing
all
the
time
Harry
saw
that
the
thing
the
persons
arms
looked
like
baby
was
merely
bundle
robes
Harry
lowered
his
wand
slightly
and
glanced
sideways
Cedric
Cedric
shot
him
quizzical
look
They
both
turned
back
watch
the
approaching
figure
stopped
beside
towering
marble
headstone
only
six
feet
from
them
For
second
Harry
and
Cedric
and
the
short
figure
simply
looked
one
another
And
then
without
warning
Harry
scar
exploded
with
pain
was
agony
such
had
never
felt
all
his
life
his
wand
slipped
from
his
fingers
put
his
hands
over
his
face
his
knees
buckled
was
the
ground
and
could
see
nothing
all
his
head
was
about
split
open
From
far
away
above
his
head
heard
high
cold
voice
say
Kill
the
spare
swishing
noise
and
second
voice
which
screeched
the
words
the
night
Avada
Kedavra
blast
green
light
blazed
through
Harry
eyelids
and
heard
something
heavy
fall
the
ground
beside
him
the
pain
his
scar
reached
such
pitch
that
retched
and
then
diminished
terrified
what
was
about
see
opened
his
stinging
eyes
Cedric
was
lying
spread
eagled
the
ground
beside
him
was
dead
For
second
that
contained
eternity
Harry
stared
into
Cedric
face
his
open
gray
eyes
blank
and
expressionless
the
windows
deserted
house
his
half
open
mouth
which
looked
slightly
surprised
And
then
before
Harry
mind
had
accepted
what
was
seeing
before
could
feel
anything
but
numb
disbelief
felt
himself
being
pulled
his
feet
The
short
man
the
cloak
had
put
down
his
bundle
lit
his
wand
and
was
dragging
Harry
toward
the
marble
headstone
Harry
saw
the
name
upon
flickering
the
wandlight
before
was
forced
around
and
slammed
against
TOM
RIDDLE
The
cloaked
man
was
now
conjuring
tight
cords
around
Harry
tying
him
from
neck
ankles
the
headstone
Harry
could
hear
shallow
fast
breathing
from
the
depths
the
hood
struggled
and
the
man
hit
him
hit
him
with
hand
that
had
finger
missing
And
Harry
realized
who
was
under
the
hood
was
Wormtail
You
gasped
But
Wormtail
who
had
finished
conjuring
the
ropes
did
not
reply
was
busy
checking
the
tightness
the
cords
his
fingers
trembling
uncontrollably
rumbling
over
the
knots
Once
sure
that
Harry
was
bound
tightly
the
headstone
that
couldn
move
inch
Wormtail
drew
length
some
black
material
from
the
inside
his
cloak
and
stuffed
roughly
into
Harry
mouth
then
without
word
turned
from
Harry
and
hurried
away
Harry
couldn
make
sound
nor
could
see
where
Wormtail
had
gone
couldn
turn
his
head
see
beyond
the
headstone
could
see
only
what
was
right
front
him
Cedric
body
was
lying
some
twenty
feet
away
Some
way
beyond
him
glinting
the
starlight
lay
the
Triwizard
Cup
Harry
wand
was
the
ground
Cedric
feet
The
bundle
robes
that
Harry
had
thought
was
baby
was
close
the
foot
the
grave
seemed
stirring
fretfully
Harry
watched
and
his
scar
seared
with
pain
again
and
suddenly
knew
that
didn
want
see
what
was
those
robes
didn
want
that
bundle
opened
could
hear
noises
his
feet
looked
down
and
saw
gigantic
snake
slithering
through
the
grass
circling
the
headstone
where
was
tied
Wormtail
fast
wheezy
breathing
was
growing
louder
again
sounded
though
was
forcing
something
heavy
across
the
ground
Then
came
back
within
Harry
range
vision
and
Harry
saw
him
pushing
stone
cauldron
the
foot
the
grave
was
full
what
seemed
water
Harry
could
hear
slopping
around
and
was
larger
than
any
cauldron
Harry
had
ever
used
great
stone
belly
large
enough
for
full
grown
man
sit
The
thing
inside
the
bundle
robes
the
ground
was
stirring
more
persistently
though
was
trying
free
itself
Now
Wormtail
was
busying
himself
the
bottom
the
cauldron
with
wand
Suddenly
there
were
crackling
names
beneath
The
large
snake
slithered
away
into
the
darkness
The
liquid
the
cauldron
seemed
heat
very
fast
The
surface
began
not
only
bubble
but
send
out
fiery
sparks
though
were
fire
Steam
was
thickening
blurring
the
outline
Wormtail
tending
the
fire
The
movements
beneath
the
robes
became
more
agitated
And
Harry
heard
the
high
cold
voice
again
Hurry
The
whole
surface
the
water
was
alight
with
sparks
now
might
have
been
encrusted
with
diamonds
ready
Master
Now
said
the
cold
voice
Wormtail
pulled
open
the
robes
the
ground
revealing
what
was
inside
them
and
Harry
let
out
yell
that
was
strangled
the
wad
material
blocking
his
mouth
was
though
Wormtail
had
flipped
over
stone
and
revealed
something
ugly
slimy
and
blind
but
worse
hundred
times
worse
The
thing
Wormtail
had
been
carrying
had
the
shape
crouched
human
child
except
that
Harry
had
never
seen
anything
less
like
child
was
hairless
and
scaly
looking
dark
raw
reddish
black
Its
arms
and
legs
were
thin
and
feeble
and
its
face
child
alive
ever
had
face
like
that
flat
and
snakelike
with
gleaming
red
eyes
The
thing
seemed
almost
helpless
raised
its
thin
arms
put
them
around
Wormtail
neck
and
Wormtail
lifted
did
his
hood
fell
back
and
Harry
saw
the
look
revulsion
Wormtail
weak
pale
face
the
firelight
carried
the
creature
the
rim
the
cauldron
For
one
moment
Harry
saw
the
evil
flat
face
illuminated
the
sparks
dancing
the
surface
the
potion
And
then
Wormtail
lowered
the
creature
into
the
cauldron
there
was
hiss
and
vanished
below
the
surface
Harry
heard
its
frail
body
hit
the
bottom
with
soft
thud
Let
drown
Harry
thought
his
scar
burning
almost
past
endurance
please
let
drown
Wormtail
was
speaking
His
voice
shook
seemed
frightened
beyond
his
wits
raised
his
wand
closed
his
eyes
and
spoke
the
night
Bone
the
father
unknowingly
given
you
wil
lrenew
your
son
The
surface
the
grave
Harry
feet
cracked
Horrified
Harry
watched
fine
trickle
dust
rose
into
the
air
Wormtail
command
and
fell
softly
into
the
cauldron
The
diamond
surface
the
water
broke
and
hissed
sent
sparks
all
directions
and
turned
vivid
poisonous
looking
blue
And
now
Wormtail
was
whimpering
pulled
long
thin
shining
silver
dagger
from
inside
his
cloak
His
voice
broke
into
petrified
sobs
Flesh
the
servant
willingly
given
you
will
revive
your
master
stretched
his
right
hand
out
front
him
the
hand
with
the
missing
finger
gripped
the
dagger
very
tightly
his
left
hand
and
swung
upward
Harry
realized
what
Wormtail
was
about
second
before
happened
closed
his
eyes
tightly
could
but
could
not
block
the
scream
that
pierced
the
night
that
went
through
Harry
though
had
been
stabbed
with
the
dagger
too
heard
something
fall
the
ground
heard
Wormtail
anguished
panting
then
sickening
splash
something
was
dropped
into
the
cauldron
Harry
couldn
stand
look
but
the
potion
had
turned
burning
red
the
light
shone
through
Harry
closed
eyelids
Wormtail
was
gasping
and
moaning
with
agony
Not
until
Harry
felt
Wormtail
anguished
breath
his
face
did
realize
that
Wormtail
was
right
front
him
blood
the
enemy
forcibly
taken
you
will
resurrect
your
foe
Harry
could
nothing
prevent
was
tied
too
tightly
Squinting
down
struggling
hopelessly
the
ropes
binding
him
saw
the
shining
silver
dagger
shaking
Wormtails
remaining
hand
felt
its
point
penetrate
the
crook
his
right
arm
and
blood
seeping
down
the
sleeve
his
torn
robes
Wormtail
still
panting
with
pain
rumbled
his
pocket
for
glass
vial
and
held
Harry
cut
that
dribble
blood
fell
into
staggered
back
the
cauldron
with
Harrys
blood
poured
inside
The
liquid
within
turned
instantly
blinding
white
Wormtail
his
job
done
dropped
his
knees
beside
the
cauldron
then
slumped
sideways
and
lay
the
ground
cradling
the
bleeding
stump
his
arm
gasping
and
sobbing
The
cauldron
was
simmering
sending
its
diamond
sparks
all
directions
blindingly
bright
that
turned
all
else
velvety
blackness
Nothing
happened
Let
have
drowned
Harry
thought
let
have
gone
wrong
And
then
suddenly
the
sparks
emanating
from
the
cauldron
were
extinguished
surge
white
steam
billowed
thickly
from
the
cauldron
instead
obliterating
everything
front
Harry
that
couldn
see
Wormtail
Cedric
anything
but
vapor
hanging
the
air
gone
wrong
thought
drowned
please
please
let
dead
But
then
through
the
mist
front
him
saw
with
icy
surge
terror
the
dark
outline
man
tall
and
skeletally
thin
rising
slowly
from
inside
the
cauldron
Robe
said
the
high
cold
voice
from
behind
the
steam
and
Wormtail
sobbing
and
moaning
still
cradling
his
mutilated
arm
scrambled
pick
the
black
robes
from
the
ground
got
his
feet
reached
and
pulled
them
one
handed
over
his
master
head
The
thin
man
stepped
out
the
cauldron
staring
Harry
and
Harry
stared
back
into
the
face
that
had
haunted
his
nightmares
for
three
years
Whiter
than
skull
with
wide
livid
scarlet
eyes
and
nose
that
was
flat
snakes
with
slits
for
nostrils
Lord
Voldemort
had
risen
again
CHAPTER
THIRTY
THREE
THE
DEATH
EATERS
Voldemort
looked
away
from
Harry
and
began
examining
his
own
body
His
hands
were
like
large
pale
spiders
his
long
white
fingers
caressed
his
own
chest
his
arms
his
face
the
red
eyes
whose
pupils
were
slits
like
cats
gleamed
still
more
brightly
through
the
darkness
held
his
hands
and
flexed
the
fingers
his
expression
rapt
and
exultant
took
not
the
slightest
notice
Wormtail
who
lay
twitching
and
bleeding
the
ground
nor
the
great
snake
which
had
slithered
back
into
sight
and
was
circling
Harry
again
hissing
Voldemort
slipped
one
those
unnaturally
long
fingered
hands
into
deep
pocket
and
drew
out
wand
caressed
gently
too
and
then
raised
and
pointed
Wormtail
who
was
lifted
off
the
ground
and
thrown
against
the
headstone
where
Harry
was
tied
fell
the
foot
and
lay
there
crumpled
and
crying
Voldemort
turned
his
scarlet
eyes
upon
Harry
laughing
high
cold
mirthless
laugh
Wormtail
robes
were
shining
with
blood
now
had
wrapped
the
stump
his
arm
them
Lord
choked
Lord
you
promised
you
did
promise
Hold
out
your
arm
said
Voldemort
lazily
Master
thank
you
Master
extended
the
bleeding
stump
but
Voldemort
laughed
again
The
other
arm
Wormtail
Master
please
please
Voldemort
bent
down
and
pulled
out
Wormtail
left
arm
forced
the
sleeve
Wormtail
robes
past
his
elbow
and
Harry
saw
something
upon
the
skin
there
something
like
vivid
red
tattoo
skull
with
snake
protruding
from
its
mouth
the
image
that
had
appeared
the
sky
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
the
Dark
Mark
Voldemort
examined
carefully
ignoring
Wormtail
uncontrollable
weeping
back
said
softly
they
will
all
have
noticed
and
now
shall
see
now
shall
know
pressed
his
long
white
forefinger
the
brand
Wormtail
arm
The
scar
Harry
forehead
seared
with
sharp
pain
again
and
Wormtail
let
out
fresh
howl
Voldemort
removed
his
fingers
from
Wormtail
mark
and
Harry
saw
that
had
turned
jet
black
look
cruel
satisfaction
his
face
Voldemort
straightened
threw
back
his
head
and
stared
around
the
dark
graveyard
How
many
will
brave
enough
return
when
they
feel
whispered
his
gleaming
red
eyes
fixed
upon
the
stars
And
how
many
will
foolish
enough
stay
away
began
pace
and
down
before
Harry
and
Wormtail
eyes
sweeping
the
graveyard
all
the
while
After
minute
looked
down
Harry
again
cruel
smile
twisting
his
snakelike
face
You
stand
Harry
Potter
upon
the
remains
late
father
hissed
softly
Muggle
and
fool
very
like
your
dear
mother
But
they
both
had
their
uses
did
they
not
Your
mother
died
defend
you
child
and
killed
father
and
see
how
useful
has
proved
himself
death
Voldemort
laughed
again
and
down
paced
looking
all
around
him
walked
and
the
snake
continued
circle
the
grass
You
see
that
house
upon
the
hillside
Potter
father
lived
there
mother
witch
who
lived
here
this
village
fell
love
with
him
But
abandoned
her
when
she
told
him
what
she
was
didn
like
magic
father
left
her
and
returned
his
Muggle
parents
before
was
even
born
Potter
and
she
died
giving
birth
leaving
raised
Muggle
orphanage
but
vowed
find
him
revenged
myself
upon
him
that
fool
who
gave
his
name
Tom
Riddle
Still
paced
his
red
eyes
darting
from
grave
grave
Listen
reliving
family
history
said
quietly
why
growing
quite
sentimental
But
look
Harry
true
family
returns
The
air
was
suddenly
full
the
swishing
cloaks
Between
graves
behind
the
yew
tree
every
shadowy
space
wizards
were
Apparating
All
them
were
hooded
and
masked
And
one
one
they
moved
forward
slowly
cautiously
though
they
could
hardly
believe
their
eyes
Voldemort
stood
silence
waiting
for
them
Then
one
the
Death
Eaters
fell
his
knees
crawled
toward
Voldemort
and
kissed
the
hem
his
black
robes
Master
Master
murmured
The
Death
Eaters
behind
him
did
the
same
each
them
approaching
Voldemort
his
knees
and
kissing
his
robes
before
backing
away
and
standing
forming
silent
circle
which
enclosed
Tom
Riddle
grave
Harry
Voldemort
and
the
sobbing
and
twitching
heap
that
was
Wormtail
Yet
they
left
gaps
the
circle
though
waiting
for
more
people
Voldemort
however
did
not
seem
expect
more
looked
around
the
hooded
faces
and
though
there
was
wind
rustling
seemed
run
around
the
circle
though
had
shivered
Welcome
Death
Eaters
said
Voldemort
quietly
Thirteen
years
thirteen
years
since
last
met
Yet
you
answer
call
though
were
yesterday
are
still
united
under
the
Dark
Mark
then
are
put
back
his
terrible
face
and
sniffed
his
slit
like
nostrils
widening
smell
guilt
said
There
stench
guilt
upon
the
air
second
shiver
ran
around
the
circle
though
each
member
longed
but
did
not
dare
step
back
from
him
see
you
all
whole
and
healthy
with
your
powers
intact
such
prompt
appearances
and
ask
myself
why
did
this
band
wizards
never
come
the
aid
their
master
whom
they
swore
eternal
loyalty
one
spoke
one
moved
except
Wormtail
who
was
upon
the
ground
still
sobbing
over
his
bleeding
arm
And
answer
myself
whispered
Voldemort
they
must
have
believed
broken
they
thought
was
gone
They
slipped
back
among
enemies
and
they
pleaded
innocence
and
ignorance
and
bewitchment
And
then
ask
myself
but
how
could
they
have
believed
would
not
rise
again
They
who
knew
the
steps
took
long
ago
guard
myself
against
mortal
death
They
who
had
seen
proofs
the
immensity
power
the
times
when
was
mightier
than
any
wizard
living
And
answer
myself
perhaps
they
believed
still
greater
power
could
exist
one
that
could
vanquish
even
Lord
Voldemort
perhaps
they
now
pay
allegiance
another
perhaps
that
champion
commoners
Mudbloods
and
Muggles
Albus
Dumbledore
the
mention
Dumbledore
name
the
members
the
circle
stirred
and
some
muttered
and
shook
their
heads
Voldemort
ignored
them
disappointment
confess
myself
disappointed
One
the
men
suddenly
flung
himself
forward
breaking
the
circle
Trembling
from
head
foot
collapsed
Voldemort
feet
Master
shrieked
Master
forgive
Forgive
all
Voldemort
began
laugh
raised
his
wand
Crucio
The
Death
Eater
the
ground
writhed
and
shrieked
Harry
was
sure
the
sound
must
carry
the
houses
around
Let
the
police
come
thought
desperately
anyone
anything
Voldemort
raised
his
wand
The
tortured
Death
Eater
lay
flat
upon
the
ground
gasping
Get
Avery
said
Voldemort
softly
Stand
You
ask
for
forgiveness
not
forgive
not
forget
Thirteen
long
years
want
thirteen
years
repayment
before
forgive
you
Wormtail
here
has
paid
some
his
debt
already
have
you
not
Wormtail
looked
down
Wormtail
who
continued
sob
You
returned
not
out
loyalty
but
out
fear
your
old
friends
You
deserve
this
pain
Wormtail
You
know
that
don
you
Yes
Master
moaned
Wormtail
please
Master
please
Yet
you
helped
return
body
said
Voldemort
coolly
watching
Wormtail
sob
the
ground
Worthless
and
traitorous
you
are
you
helped
and
Lord
Voldemort
rewards
his
helpers
Voldemort
raised
his
wand
again
and
whirled
through
the
air
streak
what
looked
like
molten
silver
hung
shining
the
wand
wake
Momentarily
shapeless
writhed
and
then
formed
itself
into
gleaming
replica
human
hand
bright
moonlight
which
soared
downward
and
fixed
itself
upon
Wormtails
bleeding
wrist
Wormtail
sobbing
stopped
abruptly
His
breathing
harsh
and
ragged
raised
his
head
and
stared
disbelief
the
silver
hand
now
attached
seamlessly
his
arm
though
were
wearing
dazzling
glove
flexed
the
shining
fingers
then
trembling
picked
small
twig
the
ground
and
crushed
into
powder
Lord
whispered
Master
beautiful
thank
you
thank
you
scrambled
forward
his
knees
and
kissed
the
hem
Voldemort
robes
May
your
loyalty
never
waver
again
Wormtail
said
Voldemort
Lord
never
Lord
Wormtail
stood
and
took
his
place
the
circle
staring
his
powerful
new
hand
his
face
still
shining
with
tears
Voldemort
now
approached
the
man
Wormtail
right
Lucius
slippery
friend
whispered
halting
before
him
told
that
you
have
not
renounced
the
old
ways
though
the
world
you
present
respectable
face
You
are
still
ready
take
the
lead
spot
Muggle
torture
believe
Yet
you
never
tried
find
Lucius
Your
exploits
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
were
fun
daresay
but
might
not
your
energies
have
been
better
directed
toward
finding
and
aiding
your
master
Lord
was
constantly
the
alert
came
Lucius
Malfoy
voice
swiftly
from
beneath
the
hood
Had
there
been
any
sign
from
you
any
whisper
your
whereabouts
would
have
been
your
side
immediately
nothing
could
have
prevented
And
yet
you
ran
from
Mark
when
faithful
Death
Eater
sent
into
the
sky
last
summer
said
Voldemort
lazily
and
Malfoy
stopped
talking
abruptly
Yes
know
all
about
that
Lucius
You
have
disappointed
expect
more
faithful
service
the
future
course
Lord
course
You
are
merciful
thank
you
Voldemort
moved
and
stopped
staring
the
space
large
enough
for
two
people
that
separated
Malfoy
and
the
next
man
The
Lestranges
should
stand
here
said
Voldemort
quietly
But
they
are
entombed
Azkaban
They
were
faithful
They
went
Azkaban
rather
than
renounce
When
Azkaban
broken
open
the
Lestranges
will
honored
beyond
their
dreams
The
dementors
will
join
they
are
our
natural
allies
will
recall
the
banished
giants
shall
have
all
devoted
servants
returned
and
army
creatures
whom
all
fear
walked
Some
the
Death
Eaters
passed
silence
but
paused
before
others
and
spoke
them
Macnair
destroying
dangerous
beasts
for
the
Ministry
Magic
now
Wormtail
tells
You
shall
have
better
victims
than
that
soon
Macnair
Lord
Voldemort
will
provide
Thank
you
Master
thank
you
murmured
Macnair
And
here
Voldemort
moved
the
two
largest
hooded
figures
have
Crabbe
you
will
better
this
time
will
you
not
Crabbe
And
you
Goyle
They
bowed
clumsily
muttering
dully
Yes
Master
will
Master
The
same
goes
for
you
Nott
said
Voldemort
quietly
walked
past
stooped
figure
Goyles
shadow
Lord
prostrate
myself
before
you
your
most
faithful
That
will
said
Voldemort
had
reached
the
largest
gap
all
and
stood
surveying
with
his
blank
red
eyes
though
could
see
people
standing
there
And
here
have
six
missing
Death
Eaters
three
dead
service
One
too
cowardly
return
will
pay
One
who
believe
has
left
forever
will
killed
course
and
one
who
remains
most
faithful
servant
and
who
has
already
reentered
service
The
Death
Eaters
stirred
and
Harry
saw
their
eyes
dart
sideways
one
another
through
their
masks
Hogwarts
that
faithful
servant
and
was
through
his
efforts
that
our
young
friend
arrived
here
tonight
Yes
said
Voldemort
grin
curling
his
lipless
mouth
the
eyes
the
circle
flashed
Harry
direction
Harry
Potter
has
kindly
joined
for
rebirthing
party
One
might
far
call
him
guest
honor
There
was
silence
Then
the
Death
Eater
the
right
Wormtail
stepped
forward
and
Lucius
Malfoy
voice
spoke
from
under
the
mask
Master
crave
know
beg
you
tell
how
you
have
achieved
this
this
miracle
how
you
managed
return
what
story
Lucius
said
Voldemort
And
begins
and
ends
with
young
friend
here
walked
lazily
over
stand
next
Harry
that
the
eyes
the
whole
circle
were
upon
the
two
them
The
snake
continued
circle
You
know
course
that
they
have
called
this
boy
downfall
Voldemort
said
softly
his
red
eyes
upon
Harry
whose
scar
began
burn
fiercely
that
almost
screamed
agony
You
all
know
that
the
night
lost
powers
and
body
tried
kill
him
His
mother
died
the
attempt
save
him
and
unwittingly
provided
him
with
protection
admit
had
not
foreseen
could
not
touch
the
boy
Voldemort
raised
one
his
long
white
fingers
and
put
very
close
Harry
cheek
His
mother
left
upon
him
the
traces
other
sacrifice
This
old
magic
should
have
remembered
was
foolish
overlook
but
matter
can
touch
him
now
Harry
felt
the
cold
tip
the
long
white
finger
touch
him
and
thought
his
head
would
burst
with
the
pain
Voldemort
laughed
softly
his
ear
then
took
the
finger
away
and
continued
addressing
the
Death
Eaters
miscalculated
friends
admit
curse
was
deflected
the
woman
foolish
sacrifice
and
rebounded
upon
myself
Aaah
pain
beyond
pain
friends
nothing
could
have
prepared
for
was
ripped
from
body
was
less
than
spirit
less
than
the
meanest
ghost
but
still
was
alive
What
was
even
not
know
who
have
gone
further
than
anybody
along
the
path
that
leads
immortality
You
know
goal
conquer
death
And
now
was
tested
and
appeared
that
one
more
experiments
had
worked
for
had
not
been
killed
though
the
curse
should
have
done
Nevertheless
was
powerless
the
weakest
creature
alive
and
without
the
means
help
myself
for
had
body
and
every
spell
that
might
have
helped
required
the
use
wand
remember
only
forcing
myself
sleeplessly
endlessly
second
second
exist
settled
faraway
place
forest
and
waited
Surely
one
faithful
Death
Eaters
would
try
and
find
one
them
would
come
and
perform
the
magic
could
not
restore
body
but
waited
vain
The
shiver
ran
once
more
around
the
circle
listening
Death
Eaters
Voldemort
let
the
silence
spiral
horribly
before
continuing
Only
one
power
remained
could
possess
the
bodies
others
But
dared
not
where
other
humans
were
plentiful
for
knew
that
the
Aurors
were
still
abroad
and
searching
for
sometimes
inhabited
animals
snakes
course
being
preference
but
was
little
better
off
inside
them
than
pure
spirit
for
their
bodies
were
ill
adapted
perform
magic
and
possession
them
shortened
their
lives
none
them
lasted
long
Then
four
years
ago
the
means
for
return
seemed
assured
wizard
young
foolish
and
gullible
wandered
across
path
the
forest
had
made
home
seemed
the
very
chance
had
been
dreaming
for
was
teacher
Dumbledore
school
was
easy
bend
will
brought
back
this
country
and
after
while
took
possession
his
body
supervise
him
closely
carried
out
orders
But
plan
failed
did
not
manage
steal
the
Sorcerer
Stone
was
not
assured
immortal
life
was
thwarted
thwarted
once
again
Harry
Potter
Silence
once
more
nothing
was
stirring
not
even
the
leaves
the
yew
tree
The
Death
Eaters
were
quite
motionless
the
glittering
eyes
their
masks
fixed
upon
Voldemort
and
upon
Harry
The
servant
died
when
left
his
body
and
was
left
weak
ever
had
been
Voldemort
continued
returned
hiding
place
far
away
and
will
not
pretend
you
that
didn
then
fear
that
might
never
regain
powers
Yes
that
was
perhaps
darkest
hour
could
not
hope
that
would
sent
another
wizard
possess
and
had
given
hope
now
that
any
Death
Eaters
cared
what
had
become
One
two
the
masked
wizards
the
circle
moved
uncomfortably
but
Voldemort
took
notice
And
then
not
even
year
ago
when
had
almost
abandoned
hope
happened
last
servant
returned
Wormtail
here
who
had
faked
his
own
death
escape
justice
was
driven
out
hiding
those
had
once
counted
friends
and
decided
return
his
master
sought
the
country
where
had
long
been
rumored
was
hiding
helped
course
the
rats
met
along
the
way
Wormtail
has
curious
affinity
with
rats
you
not
Wormtail
His
filthy
little
friends
told
him
there
was
place
deep
Albanian
forest
that
they
avoided
where
small
animals
like
themselves
had
met
their
deaths
dark
shadow
that
possessed
them
But
his
journey
back
was
not
smooth
was
Wormtail
For
hungry
one
night
the
edge
the
very
forest
where
had
hoped
find
foolishly
stopped
inn
for
some
food
and
who
should
meet
there
but
one
Bertha
Jorkins
witch
from
the
Ministry
Magic
Now
see
the
way
that
fate
favors
Lord
Voldemort
This
might
have
been
the
end
Wormtail
and
last
hope
for
regeneration
But
Wormtail
displaying
presence
mind
would
never
have
expected
from
him
convinced
Bertha
Jorkins
accompany
him
nighttime
stroll
overpowered
her
brought
her
And
Bertha
Jorkins
who
might
have
ruined
all
proved
instead

beyond
wildest
dreams
for
with
little
persuasion
she
became
veritable
mine
information
She
told
that
the
Triwizard
Tournament
would
played
Hogwarts
this
year
She
told
that
she
knew
faithful
Death
Eater
who
would
only
too
willing
help
could
only
contact
him
She
told
many
things
but
the
means
used
break
the
Memory
Charm
upon
her
were
powerful
and
when
had
extracted
all
useful
information
from
her
her
mind
and
body
were
both
damaged
beyond
repair
She
had
now
served
her
purpose
could
not
possess
her
disposed
her
Voldemort
smiled
his
terrible
smile
his
red
eyes
blank
and
pitiless
Wormtail
body
course
was
ill
adapted
for
possession
all
assumed
him
dead
and
would
attract
far
too
much
attention
noticed
However
was
the
able
bodied
servant
needed
and
poor
wizard
though
Wormtail
was
able
follow
the
instructions
gave
him
which
would

and
the

soon
returned
almost
human

and
strong
enough

There
was
hope
stealing
the
Sorcerer
Stone
anymore
for
knew
that
Dumbledore
would
have
seen
that
was
destroyed
But
was
willing
embrace

again
before
chasing

settle
for

back
again
and
old

knew
that

this
old

Dark
Magic
the
potion
that
revived
tonight
would
need
three
powerful
ingredients
Well
one
them
was
already
hand
was
not
Wormtail
Flesh
given
servant
father
bone
naturally
meant
that
would
have
come
here
where
was
buried
But
the
blood
foe
Wormtail
would
have
had
use
any
wizard
would
you
not
Wormtail
Any
wizard
who
had
hated
many
them
still
But
knew
the
one
must
use
was
rise
again
more
powerful
than
had
been
when
had
fallen
wanted
Harry
Potters
blood
wanted
the
blood
the
one
who
had
stripped
power
thirteen
years
ago
for
the
lingering
protection
his
mother
once
gave
him
would
then
reside
veins
too
But
how
get
Harry
Potter
For
has
been
better
protected
than
think
even
knows
protected
ways
devised
Dumbledore
long
ago
when
fell
him
arrange
the
boy
future
Dumbledore
invoked
ancient
magic
ensure
the
boy
protection
long
his
relations
care
Not
even
can
touch
him
there
Then
course
there
was
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
thought
his
protection
might
weaker
there
away
from
his
relations
and
Dumbledore
but
was
not
yet
strong
enough
attempt
kidnap
the
midst
horde
Ministry
wizards
And
then
the
boy
would
return
Hogwarts
where
under
the
crooked
nose
that
Muggle
loving
fool
from
morning
until
night
how
could
take
him
Why
using
Bertha
Jorkins
information
course
Use
one
faithful
Death
Eater
stationed
Hogwarts
ensure
that
the
boy
name
was
entered
into
the
Goblet
Fire
Use
Death
Eater
ensure
that
the
boy
won
the
tournament
that
touched
the
Triwizard
Cup
first
the
cup
which
Death
Eater
had
turned
into
Portkey
which
would
bring
him
here
beyond
the
reach
Dumbledore
help
and
protection
and
into
waiting
arms
And
here
the
boy
you
all
believed
had
been
downfall
Voldemort
moved
slowly
forward
and
turned
face
Harry
raised
his
wand
Crucio
was
pain
beyond
anything
Harry
had
ever
experienced
his
very
bones
were
fire
his
head
was
surely
splitting
along
his
scar
his
eyes
were
rolling
madly
his
head
wanted
end
black
out
die
And
then
was
gone
was
hanging
limply
the
ropes
binding
him
the
headstone
Voldemort
father
looking
into
those
bright
red
eyes
through
kind
mist
The
night
was
ringing
with
the
sound
the
Death
Eaters
laughter
You
see
think
how
foolish
was
suppose
that
this
boy
could
ever
have
been
stronger
than
said
Voldemort
But
want
there
mistake
anybody
mind
Harry
Potter
escaped
lucky
chance
And
now
going
prove
power
killing
him
here
and
now
front
you
all
when
there
Dumbledore
help
him
and
mother
die
for
him
will
give
him
his
chance
will
allowed
fight
and
you
will
left
doubt
which
the
stronger
Just
little
longer
Nagini
whispered
and
the
snake
glided
away
through
the
grass
where
the
Death
Eaters
stood
watching
Now
untie
him
Wormtail
and
give
him
back
his
wand
CHAPTER
THIRTY
FOUR
PRIORI
INCANTATEM
Wormtail
approached
Harry
who
scrambled
find
his
feet
support
his
own
weight
before
the
ropes
were
untied
Wormtail
raised
his
new
silver
hand
pulled
out
the
wad
material
gagging
Harry
and
then
with
one
swipe
cut
through
the
bonds
tying
Harry
the
gravestone
There
was
split
second
perhaps
when
Harry
might
have
considered
running
for
but
his
injured
leg
shook
under
him
stood
the
overgrown
grave
the
Death
Eaters
closed
ranks
forming
tighter
circle
around
him
and
Voldemort
that
the
gaps
where
the
missing
Death
Eaters
should
have
stood
were
filled
Wormtail
walked
out
the
circle
the
place
where
Cedric
body
lay
and
returned
with
Harry
wand
which
thrust
roughly
into
Harry
hand
without
looking
him
Then
Wormtail
resumed
his
place
the
circle
watching
Death
Eaters
You
have
been
taught
how
duel
Harry
Potter
said
Voldemort
softly
his
red
eyes
glinting
through
the
darkness
these
words
Harry
remembered
though
from
former
life
the
dueling
club
Hogwarts
had
attended
briefly
two
years
ago
All
had
learned
there
was
the
Disarming
Spell
Expelliarmus
and
what
use
would
deprive
Voldemort
his
wand
even
could
when
was
surrounded
Death
Eaters
outnumbered
least
thirty
one
had
never
learned
anything
that
could
possibly
fit
him
for
this
knew
was
facing
the
thing
against
which
Moody
had
always
warned
the
unblockable
Avada
Kedavra
curse
and
Voldemort
was
right
his
mother
was
not
here
die
for
him
this
time
was
quite
unprotected
bow
each
other
Harry
said
Voldemort
bending
little
but
keeping
his
snakelike
face
upturned
Harry
Come
the
niceties
must
observed
Dumbledore
would
like
you
show
manners
Bow
death
Harry
The
Death
Eaters
were
laughing
again
Voldemorts
lipless
mouth
was
smiling
Harry
did
not
bow
was
not
going
let
Voldemort
play
with
him
before
killing
him
was
not
going
give
him
that
satisfaction
said
bow
Voldemort
said
raising
his
wand
and
Harry
felt
his
spine
curve
though
huge
invisible
hand
were
bending
him
ruthlessly
forward
and
the
Death
Eaters
laughed
harder
than
ever
Very
good
said
Voldemort
softly
and
raised
his
wand
the
pressure
bearing
down
upon
Harry
lifted
too
And
now
you
face
like
man
straight
backed
and
proud
the
way
your
father
died
And
now
duel
Voldemort
raised
his
wand
and
before
Harry
could
anything
defend
himself
before
could
even
move
had
been
hit
again
the
Cruciatus
Curse
The
pain
was
intense
all
consuming
that
longer
knew
where
was
White
hot
knives
were
piercing
every
inch
his
skin
his
head
was
surely
going
burst
with
pain
was
screaming
more
loudly
than
ever
screamed
his
life
And
then
stopped
Harry
rolled
over
and
scrambled
his
feet
was
shaking
uncontrollably
Wormtail
had
done
when
his
hand
had
been
cut
off
staggered
sideways
into
the
wall
watching
Death
Eaters
and
they
pushed
him
away
back
toward
Voldemort
little
break
said
Voldemort
the
slit
like
nostrils
dilating
with
excitement
little
pause
That
hurt
didn
Harry
You
don
want
that
again
you
Harry
didn
answer
was
going
die
like
Cedric
those
pitiless
red
eyes
were
telling
him
was
going
die
and
there
was
nothing
could
about
but
wasn
going
play
along
wasn
going
obey
Voldemort
wasn
going
beg
asked
you
whether
you
want
that
again
said
Voldemort
softly
Answer
Imperial
And
Harry
felt
for
the
third
time
his
life
the
sensation
that
his
mind
had
been
wiped
all
thought
was
bliss
not
think
was
though
were
floating
dreaming
just
answer
say
just
answer
will
not
said
stronger
voice
the
back
his
head
won
answer
Just
answer
won
won
say
Just
answer
WON
And
these
words
burst
from
Harry
mouth
they
echoed
through
the
graveyard
and
the
dream
state
was
lifted
suddenly
though
cold
water
had
been
thrown
over
him
back
rushed
the
aches
that
the
Cruciatus
Curse
had
left
all
over
his
body
back
rushed
the
realization
where
was
and
what
was
facing
You
won
said
Voldemort
quietly
and
the
Death
Eaters
were
not
laughing
now
You
won
say
Harry
obedience
virtue
need
teach
you
before
you
die
Perhaps
another
little
dose
pain
Voldemort
raised
his
wand
but
this
time
Harry
was
ready
with
the
reflexes
born
his
Quidditch
training
flung
himself
sideways
onto
the
ground
rolled
behind
the
marble
headstone
Voldemort
father
and
heard
crack
the
curse
missed
him
are
not
playing
hide
and
seek
Harry
said
Voldemort
soft
cold
voice
drawing
nearer
the
Death
Eaters
laughed
You
cannot
hide
from
Does
this
mean
you
are
tired
our
duel
Does
this
mean
that
you
would
prefer
finish
now
Harry
Come
out
Harry
come
out
and
play
then
will
quick
might
even
painless
would
not
know
have
never
died
Harry
crouched
behind
the
headstone
and
knew
the
end
had
come
There
was
hope
help
had
And
heard
Voldemort
draw
nearer
still
knew
one
thing
only
and
was
beyond
fear
reason
was
not
going
die
crouching
here
like
child
playing
hide
and
seek
was
not
going
die
kneeling
Voldemort
feet
was
going
die
upright
like
his
father
and
was
going
die
trying
defend
himself
even
defense
was
possible
Before
Voldemort
could
stick
his
snakelike
face
around
the
headstone
Harry
stood
gripped
his
wand
tightly
his
hand
thrust
out
front
him
and
threw
himself
around
the
headstone
facing
Voldemort
Voldemort
was
ready
Harry
shouted
Expelliarmus
Voldemort
cried
Avada
Kedavra
jet
green
light
issued
from
Voldemorts
wand
just
jet
red
light
blasted
from
Harry
they
met
midair
and
suddenly
Harry
wand
was
vibrating
though
electric
charge
were
surging
through
his
hand
seized
around
couldn
have
released
wanted
and
narrow
beam
light
connected
the
two
wands
neither
red
nor
green
but
bright
deep
gold
Harry
following
the
beam
with
his
astonished
gaze
saw
that
Voldemort
long
white
fingers
too
were
gripping
wand
that
was
shaking
and
vibrating
And
then
nothing
could
have
prepared
Harry
for
this
felt
his
feet
lift
from
the
ground
and
Voldemort
were
both
being
raised
into
the
air
their
wands
still
connected
that
thread
shimmering
golden
light
They
glided
away
from
the
tombstone
Voldemort
father
and
then
came
rest
patch
ground
that
was
clear
and
free
graves
The
Death
Eaters
were
shouting
they
were
asking
Voldemort
for
instructions
they
were
closing
reforming
the
circle
around
Harry
and
Voldemort
the
snake
slithering
their
heels
some
them
drawing
their
wands
The
golden
thread
connecting
Harry
and
Voldemort
splintered
though
the
wands
remained
connected
thousand
more
beams
arced
high
over
Harry
and
Voldemort
crisscrossing
all
around
them
until
they
were
enclosed
golden
dome
shaped
web
cage
light
beyond
which
the
Death
Eaters
circled
like
jackals
their
cries
strangely
muffled
now
nothing
Voldemort
shrieked
the
Death
Eaters
and
Harry
saw
his
red
eyes
wide
with
astonishment
what
was
happening
saw
him
fighting
break
the
thread
light
still
connecting
his
wand
with
Harry
Harry
held
onto
his
wand
more
tightly
with
both
hands
and
the
golden
thread
remained
unbroken
nothing
unless
command
you
Voldemort
shouted
the
Death
Eaters
And
then
unearthly
and
beautiful
sound
filled
the
air
was
coming
from
every
thread
the
light
spun
web
vibrating
around
Harry
and
Voldemort
was
sound
Harry
recognized
though
had
heard
only
once
before
his
life
phoenix
song
was
the
sound
hope
Harry
the
most
beautiful
and
welcome
thing
had
ever
heard
his
life
felt
though
the
song
were
inside
him
instead
just
around
him
was
the
sound
connected
with
Dumbledore
and
was
almost
though
friend
were
speaking
his
ear
Don
break
the
connection
know
Harry
told
the
music
know
mustn
but
sooner
had
thought
than
the
thing
became
much
harder
His
wand
began
vibrate
more
powerfully
than
ever
and
now
the
beam
between
him
and
Voldemort
changed
too
was
though
large
beads
light
were
sliding
and
down
the
thread
connecting
the
wands
Harry
felt
his
wand
give
shudder
under
his
hand
the
light
beads
began
slide
slowly
and
steadily
his
way
The
direction
the
beams
movement
was
now
toward
him
from
Voldemort
and
felt
his
wand
shudder
angrily
the
closest
bead
light
moved
nearer
Harrys
wand
tip
the
wood
beneath
his
fingers
grew
hot
feared
would
burst
into
flame
The
closer
that
bead
moved
the
harder
Harry
wand
vibrated
was
sure
his
wand
would
not
survive
contact
with
felt
though
was
about
shatter
under
his
fingers
concentrated
every
last
particle
his
mind
upon
forcing
the
bead
back
toward
Voldemort
his
ears
full
phoenix
song
his
eyes
furious
fixed
and
slowly
very
slowly
the
beads
quivered
halt
and
then
just
slowly
they
began
move
the
other
way
and
was
Voldemort
wand
that
was
vibrating
extra
hard
now
Voldemort
who
looked
astonished
and
almost
fearful
One
the
beads
light
was
quivering
inches
from
the
tip
Voldemorts
wand
Harry
didn
understand
why
was
doing
didn
know
what
might
achieve
but
now
concentrated
had
never
done
his
life
forcing
that
bead
light
right
back
into
Voldemort
wand
and
slowly
very
slowly
moved
along
the
golden
thread
trembled
for
moment
and
then
connected
once
Voldemorts
wand
began
emit
echoing
screams
pain
then
Voldemort
red
eyes
widened
with
shock
dense
smoky
hand
flew
out
the
tip
and
vanished
the
ghost
the
hand
had
made
Wormtail
more
shouts
pain
and
then
something
much
larger
began
blossom
from
Voldemorts
wand
tip
great
grayish
something
that
looked
though
were
made
the
solidest
densest
smoke
was
head
now
chest
and
arms
the
torso
Cedric
Diggory
ever
Harry
might
have
released
his
wand
from
shock
would
have
been
then
but
instinct
kept
him
clutching
his
wand
tightly
that
the
thread
golden
light
remained
unbroken
even
though
the
thick
gray
ghost
Cedric
Diggory
was
ghost
looked
solid
emerged
its
entirety
from
the
end
Voldemort
wand
though
were
squeezing
itself
out
very
narrow
tunnel
and
this
shade
Cedric
stood
and
looked
and
down
the
golden
thread
light
and
spoke
Hold
Harry
said
Its
voice
was
distant
and
echoing
Harry
looked
Voldemort
his
wide
red
eyes
were
still
shocked
had
more
expected
this
than
Harry
had
and
very
dimly
Harry
heard
the
frightened
yells
the
Death
Eaters
prowling
around
the
edges
the
golden
dome
More
screams
pain
from
the
wand
and
then
something
else
emerged
from
its
tip
the
dense
shadow
second
head
quickly
followed
arms
and
torso
old
man
Harry
had
seen
only
dream
was
now
pushing
himself
out
the
end
the
wand
just
Cedric
had
done
and
his
ghost
his
shadow
whatever
was
fell
next
Cedric
and
surveyed
Harry
and
Voldemort
and
the
golden
web
and
the
connected
wands
with
mild
surprise
leaning
his
walking
stick
was
real
wizard
then
the
old
man
said
his
eyes
Voldemort
Killed
that
one
did
You
fight
him
boy
But
already
yet
another
head
was
emerging
and
this
head
gray
smoky
statue
was
woman
Harry
both
arms
shaking
now
fought
keep
his
wand
still
saw
her
drop
the
ground
and
straighten
like
the
others
staring
The
shadow
Bertha
Jorkins
surveyed
the
battle
before
her
with
wide
eyes
Don
let
now
she
cried
and
her
voice
echoed
like
Cedrics
though
from
very
far
away
Don
let
him
get
you
Harry
don
let
She
and
the
other
two
shadowy
figures
began
pace
around
the
inner
walls
the
golden
web
while
the
Death
Eaters
flitted
around
the
outside
and
Voldemort
dead
victims
whispered
they
circled
the
duelers
whispered
words
encouragement
Harry
and
hissed
words
Harry
couldn
hear
Voldemort
And
now
another
head
was
emerging
from
the
tip
Voldemorts
wand
and
Harry
knew
when
saw
who
would
knew
though
had
expected
from
the
moment
when
Cedric
had
appeared
from
the
wand
knew
because
the
man
appearing
was
the
one
thought
more
than
any
other
tonight
The
smoky
shadow
tall
man
with
untidy
hair
fell
the
ground
Bertha
had
done
straightened
and
looked
him
and
Harry
his
arms
shaking
madly
now
looked
back
into
the
ghostly
face
his
father
Your
mother
coming
said
quietly
She
wants
see
you
will
all
right
hold
And
she
came
first
her
head
then
her
body
young
woman
with
long
hair
the
smoky
shadowy
form
Lily
Potter
blossomed
from
the
end
Voldemort
wand
fell
the
ground
and
straightened
like
her
husband
She
walked
close
Harry
looking
down
him
and
she
spoke
the
same
distant
echoing
voice
the
others
but
quietly
that
Voldemort
his
face
now
livid
with
fear
his
victims
prowled
around
him
could
not
hear
When
the
connection
broken
will
linger
for
only
moments
but
will
give
you
time
you
must
get
the
Portkey
will
return
you
Hogwarts
you
understand
Harry
Yes
Harry
gasped
fighting
now
keep
hold
his
wand
which
was
slipping
and
sliding
beneath
his
fingers
Harry
whispered
the
figure
Cedric
take
body
back
will
you
Take
body
back
parents
will
said
Harry
his
face
screwed
with
the
effort
holding
the
wand
now
whispered
his
father
voice
ready
run
now
NOW
Harry
yelled
didn
think
could
have
held
for
another
moment
anyway
pulled
his
wand
upward
with
almighty
wrench
and
the
golden
thread
broke
the
cage
light
vanished
the
phoenix
song
died
but
the
shadowy
figures
Voldemort
victims
did
not
disappear
they
were
closing
upon
Voldemort
shielding
Harry
from
his
gaze
And
Harry
ran
had
never
run
his
life
knocking
two
stunned
Death
Eaters
aside
passed
zigzagged
behind
headstones
feeling
their
curses
following
him
hearing
them
hit
the
headstones
was
dodging
curses
and
graves
pelting
toward
Cedric
body
longer
aware
the
pain
his
leg
his
whole
being
concentrated
what
had
Stun
him
heard
Voldemort
scream
Ten
feet
from
Cedric
Harry
dived
behind
marble
angel
avoid
the
jets
red
light
and
saw
the
tip
its
wing
shatter
the
spells
hit
Gripping
his
wand
more
tightly
dashed
out
from
behind
the
angel
Impedimenta
bellowed
pointing
his
wand
wildly
over
his
shoulder
the
Death
Eaters
running
him
From
muffled
yell
thought
had
stopped
least
one
them
but
there
was
time
stop
and
look
jumped
over
the
cup
and
dived
heard
more
wand
blasts
behind
him
more
jets
light
flew
over
his
head
fell
stretching
out
his
hand
grab
Cedric
arm
Stand
aside
will
kill
him
mine
shrieked
Voldemort
Harry
hand
had
closed
Cedric
wrist
one
tombstone
stood
between
him
and
Voldemort
but
Cedric
was
too
heavy
carry
and
the
cup
was
out
reach
Voldemort
red
eyes
flamed
the
darkness
Harry
saw
his
mouth
curl
into
smile
saw
him
raise
his
wand
Accio
Harry
yelled
pointing
his
wand
the
Triwizard
Cup
flew
into
the
air
and
soared
toward
him
Harry
caught
the
handle
heard
Voldemort
scream
fury
the
same
moment
that
felt
the
jerk
behind
his
navel
that
meant
the
Portkey
had
worked
was
speeding
him
away
whirl
wind
and
color
and
Cedric
along
with
him
They
were
going
back
CHAPTER
THIRTY
FIVE
VERITASERUM
Harry
felt
himself
slam
flat
into
the
ground
his
face
was
pressed
into
grass
the
smell
filled
his
nostrils
had
closed
his
eyes
while
the
Portkey
transported
him
and
kept
them
closed
now
did
not
move
All
the
breath
seemed
have
been
knocked
out
him
his
head
was
swimming
badly
felt
though
the
ground
beneath
him
were
swaying
like
the
deck
ship
hold
himself
steady
tightened
his
hold
the
two
things
was
still
clutching
the
smooth
cold
handle
the
Triwizard
Cup
and
Cedric
body
felt
though
would
slide
away
into
the
blackness
gathering
the
edges
his
brain
let
either
them
Shock
and
exhaustion
kept
him
the
ground
breathing
the
smell
the
grass
waiting
waiting
for
someone
something
something
happen
and
all
the
while
his
scar
burned
dully
his
forehead
torrent
sound
deafened
and
confused
him
there
were
voices
everywhere
footsteps
screams
remained
where
was
his
face
screwed
against
the
noise
though
were
nightmare
that
would
pass
Then
pair
hands
seized
him
roughly
and
turned
him
over
Harry
Harry
opened
his
eyes
was
looking
the
starry
sky
and
Albus
Dumbledore
was
crouched
over
him
The
dark
shadows
crowd
people
pressed
around
them
pushing
nearer
Harry
felt
the
ground
beneath
his
head
reverberating
with
their
footsteps
had
come
back
the
edge
the
maze
could
see
the
stands
rising
above
him
the
shapes
people
moving
them
the
stars
above
Harry
let
the
cup
but
clutched
Cedric
him
even
more
tightly
raised
his
free
hand
and
seized
Dumbledore
wrist
while
Dumbledore
face
swam
and
out
focus
back
Harry
whispered
back
Voldemort
What
going
What
happened
The
face
Cornelius
Fudge
appeared
upside
down
over
Harry
looked
white
appalled
God
Diggory
whispered
Dumbledore
dead
The
words
were
repeated
the
shadowy
figures
pressing
them
gasped
those
around
them
and
then
others
shouted
screeched
into
the
night
dead
dead
Cedric
Diggory
Dead
Harry
let
him
heard
Fudge
voice
say
and
felt
fingers
trying
pry
him
from
Cedric
limp
body
but
Harry
wouldn
let
him
Then
Dumbledore
face
which
was
still
blurred
and
misted
came
closer
Harry
you
can
help
him
now
over
Let

Harry
muttered
seemed
important

That

Harry
just

Dumbledore
bent
down
and
with
extraordinary
strength
for
man

and
thin
raised
Harry
from
the
ground
and
set
him
his
feet
Harry
swayed
His
head
was
pounding
His
injured
leg
would
longer
support
his
weight
The
crowd
around
them
jostled
fighting

darkly

Harry
thickly

worse
than
ever
You

Come

Someone
larger
and
stronger
than
was

half
pulling

carrying
him
through
the

crowd
Harry
heard
people
gasping
screaming
and
shouting
the
man
supporting
him

path
through
them
taking
him
back

castle
Across
the
lawn
past
the

and
the
Durmstrang

pushed
into
his
hands
Drink

better

now
Harry
need
know
exactly
what
happened
Moody
helped
tip
the
stuff
down
Harrys
throat
coughed
peppery
taste
burning
his
throat
Moody
office
came
into
sharper
focus
and
did
Moody
himself
looked
white
Fudge
had
looked
and
both
eyes
were
fixed
unblinkingly
upon
Harry
face
Voldemort
back
Harry
You

How
did
took
stuff
from
his
father
grave
and
from
Wormtail
and
said
Harry
His
head
felt
clearer
his
scar
wasn
hurting
badly
could
now
see
Moodys
face
distinctly
even
though
the
office
was
dark
could
still
hear
screaming
and
shouting
from
the
distant
Quidditch
field
What
did
the
Dark
Lord
take
from
you
said
Moody
Blood
said
Harry
raising
his
arm
His
sleeve
was
ripped
where
Wormtail
dagger
had
torn
Moody
let
out
his
breath
long
low
hiss
And
the
Death
Eaters
They
returned
Yes
said
Harry
Loads
them
How
did
treat
them
Moody
asked
quietly
Did
forgive
them
But
Harry
had
suddenly
remembered
should
have
told
Dumbledore
should
have
said
straightaway
There
Death
Eater
Hogwarts
There
Death
Eater
here
they
put

Goblet

Harry
tried
get
but
Moody
pushed
him
back
down
know
who
the
Death
Eater
said
quietly
Karkaroff
said
Harry
wildly
Where
Have
you
got
him
locked
Karkaroff
said
Moody
with
odd
laugh
Karkaroff
fled
tonight
when
felt
the
Dark
Mark
burn
upon
his
arm
betrayed
too
many
faithful
supporters
the
Dark
Lord
wish
meet
them
but
doubt
will
get
far
The
Dark
Lord
has
ways
tracking
his
enemies
Karkaroff
gone
ran
away
But
then
didn
put
name
the
goblet
said
Moody
slowly
didn
was
who
did
that
Harry
heard
but
didn
believe
you
didn
said
You
didn
that
you
can
have
done
assure
you
did
said
Moody
and
his
magical
eye
swung
around
and
fixed
upon
the
door
and
Harry
knew
was
making
sure
that
there
was
one
outside
the
same
time
Moody
drew
out
his
wand
and
pointed
Harry
forgave
them
then
said
The
Death
Eaters
who
went
free
The
ones
who
escaped
Azkaban
What
said
Harry
was
looking
the
wand
Moody
was
pointing
him
This
was
bad
joke
had
asked
you
said
Moody
quietly
whether
forgave
the
scum
who
never
even
went
look
for
him
Those
treacherous
cowards
who
wouldn
even
brave
Azkaban
for
him
The
faithless
worthless
bits
filth
who
were
brave
enough
cavort
masks
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
but
fled
the
sight
the
Dark
Mark
when
fired
into
the
sky
You
fired
What
are
you
talking
about
told
you
Harry
told
you
there
one
thing
hate
more
than
any
other
Death
Eater
who
walked
free
They
turned
their
backs
master
when
needed
them
most
expected
him
punish
them
expected
him
torture
them
Tell

them
Harry
Moody
face
was
suddenly
lit
with
insane
smile
Tell
told
them
that
alone
remained
faithful
prepared
risk
everything
deliver
him
the
one
thing
wanted
above
all
you
You
didn
can
you
Who
put
your
name

Goblet
Fire
under
the
name
different
school
did
Who
frightened
off
every
person
thought
might
try
hurt
you
prevent
you
from
winning
the
tournament
did
Who
nudged
Hagrid
into
showing
you
the
dragons

Who
helped
you
see
the
only
way
you
could
beat
the
dragon
did
Moody
magical
eye
had
now
left
the
door
was
fixed
upon
Harry
His
lopsided
mouth
leered
more
widely
than
ever
hasn
been
easy
Harry
guiding
you
through
these
tasks
without
arousing
suspicion
have
had
use
every
ounce
cunning
possess
that
hand
would
not
detectable
your
success
Dumbledore
would
have
been
very
suspicious
you
had
managed
everything
too
easily
long
you
got
into
that
maze
preferably
with
decent
head
start
then
knew
would
have
chance
getting
rid
the
other
champions
and
leaving
your
way
clear
But
also
had
contend
with
your
stupidity
The
second
task
that
was
when
was
most
afraid
would
fail
was
keeping
watch
you
Potter
knew
you
hadn
worked
out
the
egg
clue
had
give
you
another
hint
You
didn
Harry
said
hoarsely
Cedric
gave
the
clue
Who
told
Cedric
open
underwater
did
trusted
that
would
pass
the
information
you
Decent
people
are
easy
manipulate
Potter
was
sure
Cedric
would
want
repay
you
for
telling
him
about
the
dragons
and
did
But
even
then
Potter
even
then
you
seemed
likely
fail
was
watching
all
the
time
all
those
hours
the
library
Didn
you
realize
that
the
book
you
needed
was
your
dormitory
all
along
planted
there
early
gave
the
Longbottom
boy
don
you
remember
Magical
Water
Plants
the
Mediterranean
would
have
told
you
all
you
needed
know
about
gillyweed
expected
you
ask
everyone
and
anyone
you
could
for
help
Longbottom
would
have
told
you
instant
But
you
did
not
you
did
not
You
have
streak
pride
and
independence
that
might
have
ruined
all
what
could
Feed
you
information
from
another
innocent
source
You
told
the
Yule
Ball
house
elf
called
Dobby
had
given
you
Christmas
present
called

staged
loud
conversation
with
Professor
McGonagall
about
the
hostages
who
had
been
taken
and
whether
Potter
would
think
use
gillyweed
And
your
little
elf
friend
ran
straight
Snape
office
and
then
hurried
find
you
Moodys
wand
was
still
pointing
directly
Harry
heart
Over
his
shoulder
foggy
shapes
were
moving
the
Foe
Glass
the
wall
You
were
long
that
lake
Potter
thought
you
had
drowned
But
luckily
Dumbledore
took
your
idiocy
for
nobility
and
marked
you
high
for
breathed
again
You
had
easier
time
than
you
should
have
that
maze
tonight
course
said
Moody
was
patrolling
around
able
see
through
the
outer
hedges
able
curse
many
obstacles
out
your
way
Stunned
Fleur
Delacour
she
passed
put
the
Imperius
Curse
Krum
that
would
finish
Diggory
and
leave
your
path
the
cup
clear
Harry
stared
Moody
just
didn
see
how
this
could
Dumbledore
friend
the
famous
Auror
the
one
who
had
caught
many
Death
Eaters
made
sense
sense
all
The
foggy
shapes
the
Foe
Glass
were
sharpening
had
become
more
distinct
Harry
could
see
the
outlines
three
people
over
Moody
shoulder
moving
closer
and
closer
But
Moody
wasn
watching
them
His
magical
eye
was
upon
Harry
The
Dark
Lord
didn
manage
kill
you
Potter
and
wanted
whispered
Moody
Imagine
how

and
then

beyond
all
other
Death
Eaters
will
his
dearest
his
closest
supporter
closer
than
son
Moody
normal
eye
was
bulging
the
magical
eye
fixed
upon
Harry
The
door
was
barred
and
Harry
knew
would
never
reach
his
own
wand
time
The
Dark
Lord
and
said
Moody
and
looked
completely
insane
now
towering
over
Harry
leering
down
him
have
much
common
Both
for
instance
had
very
disappointing
fathers
very
disappointing
indeed
Both
suffered
the
indignity
Harry
being
named
after
those
fathers
And
both
had
the
pleasure
the
very
great
pleasure
killing
our
fathers
ensure
the
continued
rise
the
Dark
Order
You
mad
Harry
said
couldn
stop
himself
you

Mad
said
Moody
his
voice
rising
uncontrollably
see
see
who
mad
now
that
the
Dark
Lord
has
returned
with
his
side
back
Harry
Potter
you
did
not
conquer
him
and
now
conquer
you
Moody
raised
his
wand
opened
his
mouth
Harry
plunged
his
own
hand
into
his
robes
Stupefy
There
was
blinding
flash
red
light
and
with
great
splintering
and
crashing
the
door
Moody
office
was
blasted
apart
Moody
was
thrown
backward
onto
the
office
floor
Harry
still
staring
the
place
where
Moody
face
had
been
saw
Albus
Dumbledore
Professor
Snape
and
Professor
McGonagall
looking
back
him
out
the
Foe
Glass
looked
around
and
saw
the
three
them
standing
the
doorway
Dumbledore
front
his
wand
outstretched
that
moment
Harry
fully
understood
for
the
first
time
why
people
said
Dumbledore
was
the
only
wizard
Voldemort
had
ever
feared
The
look
upon
Dumbledore
face
stared
down
the
unconscious
form
Mad
Eye
Moody
was
more
terrible
than
Harry
could
have
ever
imagined
There
was
benign
smile
upon
Dumbledore
face
twinkle
the
eyes
behind
the
spectacles
There
was
cold
fury
every
line
the
ancient
face
sense
power
radiated
from
Dumbledore
though
were
giving
off
burning
heat
stepped
into
the
office
placed
foot
underneath
Moodys
unconscious
body
and
kicked
him
over
onto
his
back
that
his
face
was
visible
Snape
followed
him
looking
into
the
Foe
Glass
where
his
own
face
was
still
visible
glaring
into
the
room
Professor
McGonagall
went
straight
Harry
Come
along
Potter
she
whispered
The
thin
line
her
mouth
was
twitching
though
she
was
about
cry
Come
along
hospital
wing
said
Dumbledore
sharply
Dumbledore
ought
look
him
been
through
enough

Minerva
because

said
Dumbledore
curtly
Understanding
the
first
step
acceptance
and
only
with
acceptance
can
there
recovery
needs
know
who
has
put
him
through
the
ordeal

suffered
tonight
and
why
Moody
Harry
said
was
still
state
complete
disbelief
How
can
have
been
Moody
This
not
Alastor
Moody
said
Dumbledore
quietly
You
have
never
known
Alastor
Moody
The
real
Moody
would
not
have
removed
you
from
sight
after
what
happened
tonight
The
moment
took
you
knew
and
followed
Dumbledore
bent
down
over
Moody
limp
form
and
put
hand
inside
his
robes
pulled
out
Moody
hip
flask
and
set
keys
ring
Then
turned
Professors
McGonagall
and
Snape
Severus
please

the
strongest
Truth
Potion

possess
and
then
down
the
kitchens
and
bring
the
house
elf

black

pumpkin
patch
Take

dog
office

him
shortly
then
come
back
here
either
Snape
McGonagall
found
these
instructions
peculiar
they
hid
their
confusion
Both
turned
once
and
left
the
office
Dumbledore
walked
over
the
trunk
with
seven
locks
fitted
the
first
key
the
lock
and
opened
contained
mass
spell
books
Dumbledore
closed
the
trunk
placed
second
key
the
second
lock
and
opened
the
trunk
again
The
spellbooks
had
vanished
this
time
contained
assortment
broken
Sneako
scopes
some
parchment
and
quills
and
what
looked
like
silvery
Invisibility
Cloak
Harry
watched
astounded
Dumbledore
placed
the
third
fourth
fifth
and
sixth
keys
their
respective
locks
reopening
the
trunk
each
time
and
revealing
different
contents
each
time
Then
placed
the
seventh
key
the
lock
threw
open
the
lid
and
Harry
let
out
cry
amazement
was
looking
down
into
kind
pit
underground
room
and
lying
the
floor
some
ten
feet
below
apparently
fast
asleep
thin
and
starved
appearance
was
the
real
Mad
Eye
Moody
His
wooden
leg
was
gone
the
socket
that
should
have
held
the
magical
eye
looked
empty
beneath
its
lid
and
chunks
his
grizzled
hair
were
missing
Harry
stared
thunderstruck
between
the
sleeping
Moody
the
trunk
and
the
unconscious
Moody
lying
the
floor
the
office
Dumbledore
climbed
into
the
trunk
lowered
himself
and
fell
lightly
onto
the
floor
beside
the
sleeping
Moody
bent
over
him
Stunned
controlled
the
Imperius
Curse
very
weak
said
course
they
would
have
needed
keep
him
alive
Harry
throw
down
the
imposter
cloak
freezing
Madam
Pomfrey
will
need
see
him
but
seems
immediate
danger
Harry
did
was
told
Dumbledore
covered
Moody
the
cloak
tucked
around
him
and
clambered
out
the
trunk
again
Then
picked
the
hip
flask
that
stood
upon
the
desk
unscrewed
and
turned
over
thick
glutinous
liquid
splattered
onto
the
office
floor
Polyjuice
Potion
Harry
said
Dumbledore
You
see
the
simplicity
and
the
brilliance
For
Moody
never
does
drink
except
from
his
hip
flask
well
known
for
The
imposter
needed
course
keep
the
real
Moody
close
that
could
continue
making
the
potion
You
see
his
hair
Dumbledore
looked
down
the
Moody
the
trunk
The
imposter
has
been
cutting
off
all
year
see
where
uneven
But
think
the
excitement
tonight
our
fake
Moody
might
have
forgotten
take
frequendy
should
have
done
the
hour
every
hour
shall
see
Dumbledore
pulled
out
the
chair
the
desk
and
sat
down
upon
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
unconscious
Moody
the
floor
Harry
stared
him
too
Minutes
passed
silence
Then
before
Harry
very
eyes
the
face
the
man
the
floor
began
change
The
scars
were
disappearing
the
skin
was
becoming
smooth
the
mangled
nose
became
whole
and
started
shrink
The
long
mane
grizzled
gray
hair
was
withdrawing
into
the
scalp
and
turning
the
color
straw
Suddenly
with
loud
clunk
the
wooden
leg
fell
away
normal
leg
regrew
its
place
next
moment
the
magical
eyeball
had
popped
out
the
man
face
real
eye
replaced
rolled
away
across
the
floor
and
continued
swivel
every
direction
Harry
saw
man
lying
before
him
pale
skinned
slightly
freckled
with
mop
fair
hair
knew
who
was
had
seen
him
Dumbledore
Pensieve
had
watched
him
being
led
away
from
court
the
dementors
trying
convince
Crouch
that
was
innocent
but
was
lined
around
the
eyes
now
and
looked
much
older
There
were
hurried
footsteps
outside
the
corridor
Snape
had
returned
with
Winky
his
heels
Professor
McGonagall
was
right
behind
them
Crouch
Snape
said
stopping
dead
the
doorway
Barty
Crouch
Good

said
Professor
McGonagall
stopping
dead
and
staring
down
the
man
the
floor
Filthy
disheveled
Winky
peered
around
Snape
legs
Her
mouth
opened
wide
and
she
let
out
piercing
shriek
Master
Barty
Master
Barty

She
flung
herself
forward
onto
the
young
man
chest

Stunned
Winky
said
Dumbledore

Snape
handed

Veritaserum
with
which
had
threatened
Harry

Dumbledore
got
bent
over
the
man
the
floor
and
pulled
him
into
sitting
position
against
the
wall
beneath
the
Foe
Glass
which
the
reflections
Dumbledore
Snape
and
McGonagall
were
still
glaring
down
upon
them
all
Winky
remained
her
knees
trembling
her
hands
over
her
face
Dumbledore
forced
the
mans
mouth
open
and
poured
three
drops
inside
Then
pointed
his
wand
the
mans
chest
and
said
Ennervate
Crouch
son
opened
his
eyes
His
face
was
slack
his
gaze
unfocused
Dumbledore
knelt
before
him
that
their
faces
were
level
Can

Dumbledore
asked
quietly
The
man

flickered
Yes
muttered

Dumbledore
softly

Barty

But
Crouch
took
another
deep
breath
and
continued
the

voice
The

CHAPTER
THIRTY
SIX
THE
PARTING
THE
WAYS
Dumbledore
stood
stared
down
Barty
Crouch
for
moment
with
disgust
his
face
Then
raised
his
wand
once
more
and
ropes
flew
out
ropes
that
twisted
themselves
around
Barty
Crouch
binding
him
tightly
turned
Professor
McGonagall
Minerva

ask
you

guard
here
while

Harry

said
Professor
McGonagall
She
looked
slightly
nauseous
though
she
had
just
watched
someone
being
sick
However
when
she
drew
out
her
wand
and
pointed
Barty
Crouch
her
hand
was
quite
steady
Severus
Dumbledore
turned
Snape

Snape
nodded
silently
and
swept
out
the
room
Harry
Dumbledore
said
gently
Harry
got
and
swayed
again
the
pain
his
leg
which
had
not
noticed
all
the
time
had
been
listening
Crouch
now
returned
full
measure
also
realized
that
was
shaking
Dumbledore
gripped
his
arm
and
helped
him
out
into
the
dark
corridor
want
you
come
office
first
Harry
said
quiedy
they
headed
the
passageway
Sirius
waiting
for
there
Harry
nodded
kind
numbness
and
sense
complete
unreality
were
upon
him
but
did
not
care
was
even
glad
didn
want
have
think
about
anything
that
had
happened
since
had
first
touched
the
Triwizard
Cup
didn
want
have
examine
the
memories
fresh
and
sharp
photographs
which
kept
flashing
across
his
mind
Mad
Eye
Moody
inside
the
trunk
Wormtail
slumped
the
ground
cradling
his
stump
arm
Voldemort
rising
from
the
steaming
cauldron
Cedric
dead
Cedric
asking
returned
his
parents
Professor
Harry
mumbled
where
are
and
Mrs
Diggory
They
are
with
Professor
Sprout
said
Dumbledore
His
voice
which
had
been
calm
throughout
the
interrogation
Barty
Crouch
shook
very
slightly
for
the
first
time
She
was
Head
Cedric
house
and
knew
him
best
They
had
reached
the
stone
gargoyle
Dumbledore
gave
the
password
sprang
aside
and
and
Harry
went
the
moving
spiral
staircase
the
oak
door
Dumbledore
pushed
open
Sirius
was
standing
there
His
face
was
white
and
gaunt
had
been
when
had
escaped
Azkaban
one
swift
moment
had
crossed
the
room
Harry
are
you
all
right
knew
knew
something
like
this
what
happened
His
hands
shook
helped
Harry
into
chair
front
the
desk
What
happened
asked
more
urgently
Dumbledore
began
tell
Sirius
everything
Barty
Crouch
had
said
Harry
was
only
half
listening
tired
every
bone
his
body
was
aching
wanted
nothing
more
than
sit
here
undisturbed
for
hours
and
hours
until
fell
asleep
and
didn
have
think
feel
anymore
There
was
soft
rush
wings
Fawkes
the
phoenix
had
left
his
perch
flown
across
the
office
and
landed
Harry
knee
Fawkes
said
Harry
quietly
stroked
the
phoenix
beautiful
scarlet
and
gold
plumage
Fawkes
blinked
peacefully
him
There
was
something
comforting
about
his
warm
weight
Dumbledore
stopped
talking
sat
down
opposite
Harry
behind
his
desk
was
looking
Harry
who
avoided
his
eyes
Dumbledore
was
going
question
him
was
going
make
Harry
relive
everything
need
know
what
happened
after
you
touched
the
Portkey
the
maze
Harry
said
Dumbledore
can
leave
that
till
morning
can
Dumbledore
said
Sirius
harshly
had
put
hand
Harrys
shoulder
Let
him
have
sleep
Let
him
rest
Harry
felt
rush
gratitude
toward
Sirius
but
Dumbledore
took
notice
Sirius
words
leaned
forward
toward
Harry
Very
unwillingly
Harry
raised
his
head
and
looked
into
those
blue
eyes
thought
could
help
you
Dumbledore
said
gently
putting
you
into
enchanted
sleep
and
allowing
you
postpone
the
moment
when
you
would
have
think
about
what
has
happened
tonight
would
But
know
better
Numbing
the
pain
for
while
will
make
worse
when
you
finally
feel
You
have
shown
bravery
beyond
anything
could
have
expected
you
ask
you
demonstrate
your
courage
one
more
time
ask
you
tell
what
happened
The
phoenix
let
out
one
soft
quavering
note
shivered
the
air
and
Harry
felt
though
drop
hot
liquid
had
slipped
down
his
throat
into
his
stomach
warming
him
and
strengthening
him
took
deep
breath
and
began
tell
them
spoke
visions
everything
that
had
passed
that
night
seemed
rise
before
his
eyes
saw
the
sparkling
surface
the
potion
that
had
revived
Voldemort
saw
the
Death
Eaters
Apparating
between
the
graves
around
them
saw
Cedric
body
lying
the
ground
beside
the
cup
Once
twice
Sirius
made
noise
though
about
say
something
his
hand
still
tight
Harry
shoulder
but
Dumbledore
raised
his
hand
stop
him
and
Harry
was
glad
this
because
was
easier
keep
going
now
had
started
was
even
relief
felt
almost
though
something
poisonous
were
being
extracted
from
him
was
costing
him
every
bit
determination
had
keep
talking
yet
sensed
that
once
had
finished
would
feel
better
When
Harry
told
Wormtail
piercing
his
arm
with
the
dagger
however
Sirius
let
out
vehement
exclamation
and
Dumbledore
stood
quickly
that
Harry
started
Dumbledore
walked
around
the
desk
and
told
Harry
stretch
out
his
arm
Harry
showed
them
both
the
place
where
his
robes
were
torn
and
the
cut
beneath
them
said
blood
would
make
him
stronger
than
used
someone
else
Harry
told
Dumbledore
said
the
protection
mother
left
have
too
And
was
right
could
touch
without
hurting
himself
touched
face
For
fleeting
instant
Harry
thought
saw
gleam
something
like
triumph
Dumbledore
eyes
But
next
second
Harry
was
sure
had
imagined
for
when
Dumbledore
had
returned
his
seat
behind
the
desk
looked
old
and
weary
Harry
had
ever
seen
him
Very
well
said
sitting
down
again
Voldemort
has
overcome
that
particular
barrier
Harry
continue
please
Harry
went
explained
how
Voldemort
had
emerged
from
the
cauldron
and
told
them
all
could
remember
Voldemort
speech
the
Death
Eaters
Then
told
how
Voldemort
had
untied
him
returned
his
wand
him
and
prepared
duel
But
when
reached
the
part
where
the
golden
beam
light
had
connected
his
and
Voldemort
wands
found
his
throat
obstructed
tried
keep
talking
but
the
memories
what
had
come
out
Voldemort
wand
were
flooding
into
his
mind
could
see
Cedric
emerging
see
the
old
man
Bertha
Jorkins
his
father
his
mother
was
glad
when
Sirius
broke
the
silence
The
wands
connected
said
looking
from
Harry
Dumbledore
Why
Harry
looked
Dumbledore
again
whose
face
there
was
arrested
look
Priori
Incantatem
muttered
His
eyes
gazed
into
Harry
and
was
almost
though

between
them

Sirius

The

and
then
those
which
preceded
looked
interrogatively
Harry
and
Harry
nodded
Which
means
said
Dumbledore
slowly
his
eyes
upon
Harry
face
that
some
form

have
reappeared
Harry
nodded
again

constricted

And
Your

Dumbledore
quietly
Yes

Harry
Sirius
grip
Harry
shoulder
was
now
tight
was
painful
The
last
murders
the
wand
performed
said
Dumbledore
nodding
reverse
order
More
would
have
appeared
course
had
you
maintained
the
connection
Very
well
Harry
these
echoes
these
shadows
what
did
they
Harry
described
how
the
figures
that
had
emerged
from
the
wand
had
prowled
the
edges
the
golden
web
how
Voldemort
had
seemed
fear
them
how
the
shadow
Harry
mother
had
told
him
what
how
Cedric
had
made
its
final
request
this
point
Harry
found
could
not
continue
looked
around
Sirius
and
saw
that
had
his
face
his
hands
Harry
suddenly
became
aware
that
Fawkes
had
left
his
knee
The
phoenix
had
fluttered
the
floor
was
resting
its
beautiful
head
against
Harry
injured
leg
and
thick
pearly
tears
were
falling
from
its
eyes
onto
the
wound
left
the
spider
The
pain
vanished
The
skin
mended
His
leg
was
repaired
will
say
again
said
Dumbledore
the
phoenix
rose
into
the
air
and
resettled
itself
upon
the
perch
beside
the
door
You
have
shown
bravery
beyond
anything
could
have
expected
you
tonight
Harry
You
have
shown
bravery
equal
those
who
died
fighting
Voldemort
the
height
his
powers
You
have
shouldered
grown
wizard
burden
and
found
yourself
equal
and
you
have
now
given
all
have
right
expect
You
will
come
with
the
hospital
wing
not
want
you
returning
the
dormitory
tonight
Sleeping
Potion
and
some
peace
Sirius
would
you
like
stay
with
him
Sirius
nodded
and
stood
transformed
back
into
the
great
black
dog
and
walked
with
Harry
and
Dumbledore
out
the
office
accompanying
them
down
flight
stairs
the
hospital
wing
When
Dumbledore
pushed
open
the
door
Harry
saw
Mrs
Weasley
Bill
Ron
and
Hermione
grouped
around
harassed
looking
Madam
Pomfrey
They
appeared
demanding
know
where
Harry
was
and
what
had
happened
him
All
them
whipped
around
Harry
Dumbledore
and
the
black
dog
entered
and
Mrs
Weasley
let
out
kind
muffled
scream
Harry
Harry
She
started
hurry
toward
him
but
Dumbledore
moved
between
them
Molly
said
holding
hand
please
listen
for
moment
Harry
has
been
through
terrible
ordeal
tonight
has
just
had
relive
for
What
needs
now
sleep
and
peace
and
quiet
would
like
you
all
stay
with
him
added
looking
around
Ron
Hermione
and
Bill
too
you
may
But
not
want
you
questioning
him
until
ready
answer
and
certainly
not
this
evening
Mrs
Weasley
nodded
She
was
very
white
She
rounded
Ron
Hermione
and
Bill
though
they
were
being
noisy
and
hissed
Did
you
hear
needs
quiet
Headmaster
said
Madam
Pomfrey
staring
the
great
black
dog
that
was
Sirius
may
ask
what
This
dog
will
remaining
with
Harry
for
while
said
Dumbledore
simply
assure
you
extremely
well
trained
Harry
will
wait
while
you
get
into
bed
Harry
felt
inexpressible
sense
gratitude
Dumbledore
for
asking
the
others
not
question
him
wasn
though
didn
want
them
there
but
the
thought
explaining
all
over
again
the
idea
reliving
one
more
time
was
more
than
could
stand
will
back
see
you
soon
have
met
with
Fudge
Harry
said
Dumbledore
would
like
you
remain
here
tomorrow
until
have
spoken
the
school
left
Madam
Pomfrey
led
Harry
nearby
bed
caught
sight
the
real
Moody
lying
motionless
bed
the
far
end
the
room
His
wooden
leg
and
magical
eye
were
lying
the
bedside
table
okay
Harry
asked
fine
said
Madam
Pomfrey
giving
Harry
some
pajamas
and
pulling
screens
around
him
took
off
his
robes
pulled
the
pajamas
and
got
into
bed
Ron
Hermione
Bill
Mrs
Weasley
and
the
black
dog
came
around
the
screen
and
settled
themselves
chairs
either
side
him
Ron
and
Hermione
were
looking
him
almost
cautiously
though
scared
him
all
right
told
them
Just
tired
Mrs
Weasleys
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
smoothed
his
bed
covers
unnecessarily
Madam
Pomfrey
who
had
bustled
off
her
office
returned
holding
small
bottle
some
purple
potion
and
goblet
You
need
drink
all
this
Harry
she
said
potion
for
dreamless
sleep
Harry
took
the
goblet
and
drank
few
mouthfuls
felt
himself
becoming
drowsy
once
Everything
around
him
became
hazy
the
lamps
around
the
hospital
wing
seemed
winking
him
friendly
way
through
the
screen
around
his
bed
his
body
felt
though
was
sinking
deeper
into
the
warmth
the
feather
matress
Before
could
finish
the
potion
before
could
say
another
word
his
exhaustion
had
carried
him
off
sleep
Harry
woke
warm
very
sleepy
that
didn
open
his
eyes
wanting
drop
off
again
The
room
was
still
dimly
lit
was
sure
was
still
nighttime
and
had
feeling
that
couldn
have
been
asleep
very
long
Then
heard
whispering
around
him
They
wake
him
they
don
shut
What
are
they
shouting
about
Nothing
else
can
have
happened
can
Harry
opened
his
eyes
blearily
Someone
had
removed
his
glasses
could
see
the
fuzzy
outlines
Mrs
Weasley
and
Bill
close
Mrs
Weasley
was
her
feet
That
Fudge
voice
she
whispered
And
that
Minerva
McGonagall
isn
But
what
are
they
arguing
about
Now
Harry
could
hear
them
too
people
shouting
and
running
toward
the
hospital
wing
Regrettable
but
all
the
same
Minerva
Cornelius
Fudge
was
saying
loudly
You
should
never
have
brought
inside
the
castle
yelled
Professor
McGonagall
When
Dumbledore
finds
out
Harry
heard
the
hospital
doors
burst
open
Unnoticed
any
the
people
around
his
bed
all
whom
were
staring
the
door
Bill
pulled
back
the
screens
Harry
sat
and
put
his
glasses
back
Fudge
came
striding
the
ward
Professors
McGonagall
and
Snape
were
his
heels
Where
Dumbledore
Fudge
demanded
Mrs
Weasley
not
here
said
Mrs
Weasley
angrily
This
hospital
wing
Minister
don
you
think
you
better
But
the
door
opened
and
Dumbledore
came
sweeping
the
ward
What
has
happened
said
Dumbledore
sharply
looking
from
Fudge
Professor
McGonagall
Why
are
you
disturbing
these
people
Minerva
surprised
you
asked
you
stand
guard
over
Barty
Crouch
There
need
stand
guard
over
him
anymore
Dumble
dore
she
shrieked
The
Minister
has
seen
that
Harry
had
never
seen
Professor
McGonagall
lose
control
like
this
There
were
angry
blotches
color
her
cheeks
and
hands
were
balled
into
fists
she
was
trembling
with
fury
When
told
Fudge
that
had
caught
the
Death
Eater
responsible
for
tonight
events
said
Snape
low
voice
seemed
feel
his
personal
safety
was
question
insisted
summoning
dementor
accompany
him
into
the
castle
brought
the
office
where
Barty
Crouch
told
him
you
would
not
agree
Dumbledore
McGonagall
fumed
told
him
you
would
never
allow
dementors
set
foot
inside
the
castle
but
dear
woman
roared
Fudge
who
likewise
looked
angrier
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
him
Minister
Magic
decision
whether
wish
bring
protection
with
when
interviewing
possibly
dangerous
But
Professor
McGonagall
voice
drowned
Fudge
The
moment
that
that
thing
entered
the
room
she
screamed
pointing
Fudge
trembling
all
over
swooped
down
Crouch
and
and
Harry
felt
chill
his
stomach
Professor
McGonagall
struggled
find
words
describe
what
had
happened
did
not
need
her
finish
her
sentence
knew
what
the
dementor
must
have
done
had
administered
its
fatal
kiss
Barty
Crouch
had
sucked
his
soul
out
through
his
mouth
was
worse
than
dead
all
accounts
loss
blustered
Fudge
seems
has
been
responsible
for
several
deaths
But
cannot
now
give
testimony
Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
was
staring
hard
Fudge
though
seeing
him
plainly
for
the
first
time
cannot
give
evidence
about
why
killed
those
people
Why
killed
them
Well
that
mystery
blustered
Fudge
was
raving
lunatic
From
what
Minerva
and
Severus
have
told
seems
have
thought
was
doing
all
You
Know
Who
instructions
Lord
Voldemort
was
giving
him
instructions
Cornelius
Dumbledore
said
Those
peoples
deaths
were
mere
products
plan
restore
Voldemort
full
strength
again
The
plan
succeeded
Voldemort
has
been
restored
his
body
Fudge
looked
though
someone
had
just
swung
heavy
weight
into
his
face
Dazed
and
blinking
stared
back
Dumbledore
couldn
quite
believe
what
had
just
heard
began
sputter
still
goggling
Dumbledore
You
Know
Who
returned
Preposterous
Come
now
Dumbledore
Minerva
and
Severus
have
doubtless
told
you
said
Dumbledore
heard
Barty
Crouch
confess
Under
the
influence
Veritaserum
told
how
was
smuggled
out
Azkaban
and
how
Voldemort
learning
his
continued
existence
from
Bertha
Jorkins
went
free
him
from
his
father
and
used
him
capture
Harry
The
plan
worked
tell
you
Crouch
has
helped
Voldemort
return
See
here
Dumbledore
said
Fudge
and
Harry
was
astonished
see
slight
smile
dawning
his
face
you
you
can
seriously
believe
that
You
Know
Who
back
Come
now
come
now
certainly
Crouch
may
have
believed
himself
acting
upon
You
Know
Who
orders
but
take
the
word
lunatic
like
that
Dumbledore
When
Harry
touched
the
Triwizard
Cup
tonight
was
transported
straight
Voldemort
said
Dumbledore
steadily
witnessed
Lord
Voldemort
rebirth
will
explain
all
you
you
will
step
office
Dumbledore
glanced
around
Harry
and
saw
that
was
awake
but
shook
his
head
and
said
afraid
cannot
permit
you
question
Harry
tonight
Fudge
curious
smile
lingered
too
glanced
Harry
then
looked
back
Dumbledore
and
said
You
are
prepared
take
Harry
word
this
are
you
Dumbledore
There
was
moment
silence
which
was
broken
Sirius
growling
His
hackles
were
raised
and
was
baring
his
teeth
Fudge
Certainly
believe
Harry
said
Dumbledore
His
eyes
were
blazing
now
heard
Crouch
confession
and
heard
Harry
account
what
happened
after
touched
the
Triwizard
Cup
the
two
stories
make
sense
they
explain
everything
that
has
happened
since
Bertha
Jorkins
disappeared
last
summer
Fudge
still
had
that
strange
smile
his
face
Once
again
glanced
Harry
before
answering
You
are
prepared
believe
that
Lord
Voldemort
has
returned
the
word
lunatic
murderer
and
boy
who
well
Fudge
shot
Harry
another
look
and
Harry
suddenly
understood
You
been
reading
Rita
Skeeter
Fudge
said
quietly
Ron
Hermione
Mrs
Weasley
and
Bill
all
jumped
None
them
had
realized
that
Harry
was
awake
Fudge
reddened
slightly
but
defiant
and
obstinate
look
came
over
his
face
And
have
said
looking
Dumbledore
have
discovered
that
you
been
keeping
certain
facts
about
the
boy
very
quiet
Parselmouth
And
having
funny
turns
all
over
the
place
assume
that
you
are
referring
the
pains
Harry
has
been
experiencing
his
scar
said
Dumbledore
coolly
You
admit
that
has
been
having
these
pains
then
said
Fudge
quickly
Headaches
Nightmares
Possibly
hallucinations
Listen
Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
taking
step
toward
Fudge
and
once
again
seemed
radiate
that
indefinable
sense
power
that
Harry
had
felt
after
Dumbledore
had
Stunned
young
Crouch
Harry
sane
you
That
scar
upon
his
forehead
has
not
addled
his
brains
believe
hurts
him
when
Lord
Voldemort
close
feeling
particularly
murderous
Fudge
had
taken
half
step
back
from
Dumbledore
but
looked
less
stubborn
You
forgive
Dumbledore
but
never
heard
curse
scar
acting
alarm
bell
before
Look
saw
Voldemort
come
back
Harry
shouted
tried
get
out
bed
again
but
Mrs
Weasley
forced
him
back
saw
the
Death
Eaters
can
give
you
their
names
Lucius
Malfoy
Snape
made
sudden
movement
but
Harry
looked
him
Snape
eyes
flew
back
Fudge
Malfoy
was
cleared
said
Fudge
visibly
affronted
very
old
family
donations
excellent
causes
Macnair
Harry
continued
Also
cleared
Now
working
for
the
Ministry
Avery
Nott
Crabbe
Goyle
You
are
merely
repeating
the
names
those
who
were
acquitted
being
Death
Eaters
thirteen
years
ago
said
Fudge
angrily
You
could
have
found
those
names
old
reports
the
trials
For
heavens
sake
Dumbledore
the
boy
was
full
some
crackpot
story
the
end
last
year
too
his
tales
are
getting
taller
and
you
still
swallowing
them
the
boy
can
talk
snakes
Dumbledore
and
you
still
think
trustworthy
You
fool
Professor
McGonagall
cried
Cedric
Diggory
Crouch
These
deaths
were
not
the
random
work
lunatic
see
evidence
the
contrary
shouted
Fudge
now
matching
her
anger
his
face
purpling
seems
that
you
are
all
determined
start
panic
that
will
destabilize
everything
have
worked
for
these
last
thirteen
years
Harry
couldn
believe
what
was
hearing
had
always
thought
Fudge
kindly
figure
little
blustering
little
pompous
but
essentially
good
natured
But
now
short
angry
wizard
stood
before
him
refusing
point
blank
accept
the
prospect
disruption
his
comfortable
and
ordered
world
believe
that
Voldemort
could
have
risen
Voldemort
has
returned
Dumbledore
repeated
you
accept
that
fact
straightaway
Fudge
and
take
the
necessary
measures
may
still
able
save
the
situation
The
first
and
most
essential
step
remove
Azkaban
from
the
control
the
dementors
Preposterous
shouted
Fudge
again
Remove
the
dementors
kicked
out
office
for
suggesting
Half
only
feel
safe
our
beds
night
because
know
the
dementors
are
standing
guard
Azkaban
The
rest
sleep
less
soundly
our
beds
Cornelius
knowing
that
you
have
put
Lord
Voldemort
most
dangerous
supporters
the
care
creatures
who
will
join
him
the
instant
asks
them
said
Dumbledore
They
will
not
remain
loyal
you
Fudge
Voldemort
can
offer
them
much
more
scope
for
their
powers
and
their
pleasures
than
you
can
With
the
dementors
behind
him
and
his
old
supporters
returned
him
you
will
hard
pressed
stop
him
regaining
the
sort
power
had
thirteen
years
ago
Fudge
was
opening
and
closing
his
mouth
though
words
could
express
his
outrage
The
second
step
you
must
take
and
once
Dumbledore
pressed
send
envoys
the
giants
Envoys
the
giants
Fudge
shrieked
finding
his
tongue
again
What
madness
this
Extend
them
the
hand
friendship
now
before
too
late
said
Dumbledore
Voldemort
will
persuade
them
did
before
that
alone
among
wizards
will
give
them
their
rights
and
their
freedom
You
you
cannot
serious
Fudge
gasped
shaking
his
head
and
retreating
further
from
Dumbledore
the
magical
community
got
wind
that
had
approached
the
giants
people
hate
them
Dumbledore
end
career
You
are
blinded
said
Dumbledore
his
voice
rising
now
the
aura
power
around
him
palpable
his
eyes
blazing
once
more
the
love
the
office
you
hold
Cornelius
You
place
too
much
importance
and
you
always
have
done
the
called
purity
blood
You
fail
recognize
that
matters
not
what
someone
born
but
what
they
grow
Your
dementor
has
just
destroyed
the
last
remaining
member
pure
blood
family
old
any
and
see
what
that
man
chose
make
his
life
tell
you
now
take
the
steps
have
suggested
and
you
will
remembered
office
out
one
the
bravest
and
greatest
Ministers
Magic
have
ever
known
Fail
act
and
history
will
remember
you
the
man
who
stepped
aside
and
allowed
Voldemort
second
chance
destroy
the
world
have
tried
rebuild
Insane
whispered
Fudge
still
backing
away
Mad
And
then
there
was
silence
Madam
Pomfrey
was
standing
frozen
the
foot
Harry
bed
her
hands
over
her
mouth
Mrs
Weasley
was
still
standing
over
Harry
her
hand
his
shoulder
prevent
him
from
rising
Bill
Ron
and
Hermione
were
staring
Fudge
your
determination
shut
your
eyes
will
carry
you
far
this
Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
have
reached
parting
the
ways
You
must
act
you
see
fit
And
shall
act
see
fit
Dumbledore
voice
carried
hint
threat
sounded
like
mere
statement
but
Fudge
bristled
though
Dumbledore
were
advancing
upon
him
with
wand
Now
see
here
Dumbledore
said
waving
threatening
finger
given
you
free
rein
always
had
lot
respect
for
you
might
not
have
agreed
with
some
your
decisions
but
kept
quiet
There
aren
many
who
have
let
you
hire
werewolves
keep
Hagrid
decide
what
teach
your
students
without
reference
the
Ministry
But
you
going
work
against
The
only
one
against
whom
intend
work
said
Dumbledore
Lord
Voldemort
you
are
against
him
then
remain
Cornelius
the
same
side
seemed
Fudge
could
think
answer
this
rocked
backward
and
forward
his
small
feet
for
moment
and
spun
his
bowler
hat
his
hands
Finally
said
with
hint
plea
his
voice
can
back
Dumbledore
just
can
Snape
strode
forward
past
Dumbledore
pulling
the
left
sleeve
his
robes
went
stuck
out
his
forearm
and
showed
Fudge
who
recoiled
There
said
Snape
harshly
There
The
Dark
Mark
not
clear
was
hour
ago
when
burned
black
but
you
can
still
see
Every
Death
Eater
had
the
sign
burned
into
him
the
Dark
Lord
was
means
distinguishing
one
another
and
his
means
summoning
him
When
touched
the
Mark
any
Death
Eater
were
Disapparate
and
Apparate
instantly
his
side
This
Mark
has
been
growing
clearer
all
year
Karkaroff
too
Why
you
think
Karkaroff
fled
tonight
both
felt
the
Mark
burn
both
knew
had
returned
Karkaroff
fears
the
Dark
Lord
vengeance
betrayed
too
many
his
fellow
Death
Eaters
sure
welcome
back
into
the
fold

stepped
back
from

Snape

taking

dropping
onto
Harrys
bedside
table
One

There

but
under
the
circumstances
crammed
his
bowler
hat
onto
his
head
and
walked
out
the
room
slamming
the
door
behind
him
The
moment
had
disappeared
Dumbledore
turned
look
the
group

Harry
bed
There

Dumbledore

Very

well
said
Madam
Pomfrey
looking
startled
and
she
too
left
Dumbledore
made
sure
that
the
door
was
closed
and
that
Madam
Pomfrey
footsteps
had
died
away
before
spoke
again
And
now
said
time
for
two
our
number
recognize
each
other
for
what
they
are
Sirius
you
could
resume
your
usual
form
The
great
black
dog
looked
Dumbledore
then
instant
turned
back
into
man
Mrs
Weasley
screamed
and
leapt
back
from
the
bed
Sirius
Black
she
shrieked
pointing
him
Mum
shut
Ron
yelled
okay
Snape
had
not
yelled
jumped
backward
but
the
look
his
face
was
one
mingled
fury
and
horror
Him
snarled
staring
Sirius
whose
face
showed
equal
dislike
What

invitation
said
Dumbledore
looking
between
them
are
you
Severus
trust
you
both
time
for
you
lay
aside
your
old
differences
and
trust
each
other
Harry
thought
Dumbledore
was
asking
for
near
miracle
Sirius
and
Snape
were
eyeing
each
other
with
the
utmost
loathing
will
settle
the
short
term
said
Dumbledore
with
bite
impatience
his
voice
for
lack
open
hostility
You
will
shake
hands
You
are
the
same
side
now
Time
short
and
unless
the
few
who
know
the
truth
not
stand
united
there
hope
for
any
Very
slowly
but
still
glaring
each
other
though
each
wished
the
other
nothing
but
ill
Sirius
and
Snape
moved
toward
each
other
and
shook
hands
They
let
extremely
quickly
That
will
going
with
said
Dumbledore
stepping
between
them
once
more
Now
have
work
for
each
you
Fudge
attitude
though
not
unexpected

You

Remus

Arabella
Figg
Mundungus
Fletcher
the
old
crowd
Lie

Lupin
for
while

there
But
said
Harry
wanted
Sirius
stay
did
not
want
have
say
goodbye
again
quickly
You
see
very
soon
Harry
said
Sirius
turning
him
promise
you
But
must
what
can
you
understand
don
you
Yeah
said
Harry
Yeah
course
Sirius
grasped
his
hand
briefly
nodded
Dumbledore
transformed
again
into
the
black
dog
and
ran
the
length
the
room
the
door
whose
handle
turned
with
paw
Then
was
gone
Severus
said
Dumbledore
turning
Snape
you
know
what
must
ask
you
you
are
ready
you
are
prepared
said
Snape
looked
slightly
paler
than
usual
and
his
cold
black
eyes
glittered
strangely
Then
good
luck
said
Dumbledore
and
watched
with
trace
apprehension
his
face
Snape
swept
wordlessly
after
Sirius
was
several
minutes
before
Dumbledore
spoke
again
must
downstairs
said
finally
must
see
the
Diggorys
Harry
take
the
rest
your
potion
will
see
all
you
later
Harry
slumped
back
against
his
pillows
Dumbledore
disappeared
Hermione
Ron
and
Mrs
Weasley
were
all
looking
him
None
them
spoke
for
very
long
time
You
got
take
the
rest
your
potion
Harry
Mrs
Weasley
said
last
Her
hand
nudged
the
sack
gold
his
bedside
cabinet
she
reached
for
the
bottle
and
the
goblet
You
have
good
long
sleep
Try
and
think
about
something
else
for
while
think
about
what
you
going
buy
with
your
winnings
don
want
that
gold
said
Harry
expressionless
voice
You
have
Anyone
can
have
shouldn
have
won
should
been
Cedric
The
thing
against
which
had
been
fighting
and
off
ever
since
had
come
out
the
maze
was
threatening
overpower
him
could
feel
burning
prickling
feeling
the
inner
corners
his
eyes
blinked
and
stared
the
ceiling
wasn
your
fault
Harry
Mrs
Weasley
whispered
told
him
take
the
cup
with
said
Harry
Now
the
burning
feeling
was
his
throat
too
wished
Ron
would
look
away
Mrs
Weasley
set
the
potion
down
the
bedside
cabinet
bent
down
and
put
her
arms
around
Harry
had
memory
ever
being
hugged
like
this
though
mother
The
full
weight
everything
had
seen
that
night
seemed
fall
upon
him
Mrs
Weasley
held
him
her
His
mother
face
his
father
voice
the
sight
Cedric
dead
the
ground
all
started
spinning
his
head
until
could
hardly
bear
until
was
screwing
his
face
against
the
howl
misery
fighting
get
out
him
There
was
loud
slamming
noise
and
Mrs
Weasley
and
Harry
broke
apart
Hermione
was
standing
the
window
She
was
holding
something
tight
her
hand
Sorry
she
whispered
Your
potion
Harry
said
Mrs
Weasley
quickly
wiping
her
eyes
the
back
her
hand
Harry
drank
one
gulp
The
effect
was
instantaneous
Heavy
irresistible
waves
dreamless
sleep
broke
over
him
fell
back
onto
his
pillows
and
thought
more
CHAPTER
THIRTY
SEVEN
THE
BEGINNING
When
looked
back
even
month
later
Harry
found
had
only
scattered
memories
the
next
few
days
was
though
had
been
through
too
much
take
any
more
The
recollections
did
have
were
very
painful
The
worst
perhaps
was
the
meeting
with
the
Diggorys
that
took
place
the
following
morning
They
did
not
blame
him
for
what
had
happened
the
contrary
both
thanked
him
for
returning
Cedric
body
them
Diggory
sobbed
through
most
the
interview
Mrs
Diggory
grief
seemed
beyond
tears
suffered
very
little
then
she
said
when
Harry
had
told
her
how
Cedric
had
died
And
after
all
Amos
died
just
when
won
the
tournament
must
have
been
happy
When
they
got
their
feet
she
looked
down
Harry
and
said
You
look
after
yourself
now
Harry
seized
the
sack
gold
the
bedside
table
You
take
this
muttered
her
should
been
Cedric
got
there
first
you
take
But
she
backed
away
from
him
yours
dear
couldn
you
keep
Harry
returned
Gryffindor
Tower
the
following
evening
From
what
Hermione
and
Ron
told
him
Dumbledore
had
spoken
the
school
that
morning
breakfast
had
merely
requested
that
they
leave
Harry
alone
that
nobody
ask
him
questions
badger
him
tell
the
story
what
had
happened
the
maze
Most
people
noticed
were
skirting
him
the
corridors
avoiding
his
eyes
Some
whispered
behind
their
hands
passed
guessed
that
many
them
had
believed
Rita
Skeeter
article
about
how
disturbed
and
possibly
dangerous
was
Perhaps
they
were
formulating
their
own
theories
about
how
Cedric
had
died
found
didn
care
very
much
liked
best
when
was
with
Ron
and
Hermione
and
they
were
talking
about
other
things
else
letting
him
sit
silence
while
they
played
chess
felt
though
all
three
them
had
reached
understanding
they
didn
need
put
into
words
that
each
was
waiting
for
some
sign
some
word
what
was
going
outside
Hogwarts
and
that
was
useless
speculate
about
what
might
coming
until
they
knew
anything
for
certain
The
only
time
they
touched
upon
the
subject
was
when
Ron
told
Harry
about
meeting
Mrs
Weasley
had
had
with
Dumbledore
before
going
home
She
went
ask
him
you
could
come
straight

summer
said
But

Dursleys

Harry
She
said
Dumbledore

Ron
shaking
his
head
darkly
suppose

trust
him

The
only
person
apart
from
Ron
and
Hermione
that
Harry
felt
able
talk
was
Hagrid

and
wagging
his

madly
Who

Hagrid

Harry

Harry
into
one
armed
hug

hair
and
said

They
saw
two
bucket

wooden

When

cookies

back

chair
and
surveyed
Harry
closely
through
his
beetle
black
eyes
You

Hagrid

evasively
Now

the
las
skrewt

was
jokin
jokin
added
hastily
seeing
the
looks
their
faces
was
with
heavy
heart
that
Harry
packed
his
trunk
the
dormitory
the
night
before
his
return
Privet
Drive
was
dreading
the
Leaving
Feast
which
was
usually
cause
for
celebration
when
the
winner
the
Inter
House
Championship
would
announced
had
avoided
being
the
Great
Hall
when
was
full
ever
since
had
left
the
hospital
wing
preferring
eat
when
was
nearly
empty
avoid
the
stares
his
fellow
students
When
Ron
and
Hermione
entered
the
Hall
they
saw
once
that
the
usual
decorations
were
missing
The
Great
Hall
was
normally
decorated
with
the
winning
House
colors
for
the
Leaving
Feast
Tonight
however
there
were
black
drapes
the
wall
behind
the
teachers
table
Harry
knew
instantly
that
they
were
there
mark
respect
Cedric
The
real
Mad
Eye
Moody
was
the
staff
table
now
his
wooden
leg
and
his
magical
eye
back
place
was
extremely
twitchy
jumping
every
time
someone
spoke
him
Harry
couldn
blame
him
Moodys
fear
attack
was
bound
have
been
increased
his
ten
month
imprisonment
his
own
trunk
Professor
Karkaroff
chair
was
empty
Harry
wondered
sat
down
with
the
other
Gryffindors
where
Karkaroff
was
now
and
whether
Voldemort
had
caught
with
him
Madame
Maxime
was
still
there
She
was
sitting
next
Hagrid
They
were
talking
quietly
together
Further
along
the
table
sitting
next
Professor
McGonagall
was
Snape
His
eyes
lingered
Harry
for
moment
Harry
looked
him
His
expression
was
difficult
read
looked
sour
and
unpleasant
ever
Harry
continued
watch
him
long
after
Snape
had
looked
away
What
was
that
Snape
had
done
Dumbledores
orders
the
night
that
Voldemort
had
returned
And
why
why
was
Dumbledore
convinced
that
Snape
was
truly
their
side
had
been
their
spy
Dumbledore
had
said
the
Pensieve
Snape
had
turned
spy
against
Voldemort
great
personal
risk
Was
that
the
job
had
taken
again
Had
made
contact
with
the
Death
Eaters
perhaps
Pretended
that
had
never
really
gone
over
Dumbledore
that
had
been
like
Voldemort
himself
biding
his
time
Harry
musings
were
ended
Professor
Dumbledore
who
stood
the
staff
table
The
Great
Hall
which
any
case
had
been
less
noisy
than
usually
was
the
Leaving
Feast
became
very
quiet
The
end
said
Dumbledore
looking
around
them
all
another
year
paused
and
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
Hufflepuff
table
Theirs
had
been
the
most
subdued
table
before
had
gotten
his
feet
and
theirs
were
still
the
saddest
and
palest
faces
the
Hall
There
much
that
would
like
say
you
all
tonight
said
Dumbledore
but
must
first
acknowledge
the
loss
very
fine
person
who
should
sitting
here
gestured
toward
the
Hufflepuffs
enjoying
our
feast
with
would
like
you
all
please
stand
and
raise
your
glasses
Cedric
Diggory
They
did
all
them
the
benches
scraped
everyone
the
Hall
stood
and
raised
their
goblets
and
echoed
one
loud
low
rumbling
voice
Cedric
Diggory
Harry
caught
glimpse
Cho
through
the
crowd
There
were
tears
pouring
silently
down
her
face
looked
down
the
table
they
all
sat
down
again
Cedric
was
person
who
exemplified
many
the
qualities
that
distinguish
Hufflepuff
house
Dumbledore
continued
was
good
and
loyal
friend
hard
worker
valued
fair
play
His
death
has
affected
you
all
whether
you
knew
him
well
not
think
that
you
have
the
right
therefore
know
exactly
how
came
about
Harry
raised
his
head
and
stared
Dumbledore
Cedric
Diggory
was
murdered
Lord
Voldemort
panicked
whisper
swept
the
Great
Hall
People
were
staring
Dumbledore
disbelief
horror
looked
perfectly
calm
watched
them
mutter
themselves
into
silence
The
Ministry
Magic
Dumbledore
continued
does
not
wish
tell
you
this
possible
that
some
your
parents
will
horrified
that
have
done
either
because
they
will
not
believe
that
Lord
Voldemort
has
returned
because
they
think
should
not
tell
you
young
you
are
belief
however
that
the
truth
generally
preferable
lies
and
that
any
attempt
pretend
that
Cedric
died
the
result
accident
some
sort
blunder
his
own
insult
his
memory
Stunned
and
frightened
every
face
the
Hall
was
turned
toward
Dumbledore
now
almost
every
face
Over
the
Slytherin
table
Harry
saw
Draco
Malfoy
muttering
something
Crabbe
and
Goyle
Harry
felt
hot
sick
swoop
anger
his
stomach
forced
himself
look
back
Dumbledore
There
somebody
else
who
must
mentioned
connection
with
Cedrics
death
Dumbledore
went
talking
course
about
Harry
Potter
kind
ripple
crossed
the
Great
Hall
few
heads
turned
Harry
direction
before
flicking
back
face
Dumbledore
Harry
Potter
managed
escape
Lord
Voldemort
said
Dumbledore
risked
his
own
life
return
Cedric
body
Hogwarts
showed
every
respect
the
sort
bravery
that
few
wizards
have
ever
shown
facing
Lord
Voldemort
and
for
this
honor
him
Dumbledore
turned
gravely
Harry
and
raised
his
goblet
once
more
Nearly
everyone
the
Great
Hall
followed
suit
They
murmured
his
name
they
had
murmured
Cedric
and
drank
him
But
through
gap
the
standing
figures
Harry
saw
that
Malfoy
Crabbe
Goyle
and
many
the
other
Slytherins
had
remained
defiantly
their
seats
their
goblets
untouched
Dumbledore
who
after
all
possessed
magical
eye
did
not
see
them
When
everyone
had
once
again
resumed
their
seats
Dumbledore
continued
The
Triwizard
Tournament
aim
was
further
and
promote
magical
understanding
the
light
what
has
happened

for
the

that

take
them

The

Arry

around
Fleur
Delacour
was
hurrying
the
stone
steps
into
the
castle
Beyond
her
far
across
the
grounds
Harry
could
see
Hagrid
helping
Madame
Maxime
back

Harrys
spirits
couldn

but
lift
slightly
watched
Fleur
hurry
back
across
the
lawns
Madame
Maxime
her
silvery
hair
rippling
the
sunlight
Wonder
how
the
Durmstrang
students
are
getting
back
said
Ron
you
reckon
they
can
steer
that
ship
without
Karkaroff
Karkaroff
did
not

said
gruff
voice
stayed
his
cabin
and
let
the
vork
Krum
had
come
say
good
bye
Hermione
Could
have
vord
asked
her
yes
all
right
said
Hermione
looking
slightly
flustered
and
following
Krum
through
the
crowd
and
out
sight
You
better
hurry
Ron
called
loudly
after
her
The
carriages
here
minute
let
Harry
keep
watch
for
the
carriages
however
and
spent
the
next
few
minutes
craning
his
neck
over
the
crowd
try
and
see
what
Krum
and
Hermione
might
They
returned
quite
soon
Ron
stared
Hermione
but
her
face
was
quite
impassive
liked
Diggory
said
Krum
abruptly
Harry
vos
alvays
polite
Alvays
Even
though
vos
from
Durmstrang
with
Karkaroff
added
scowling
Have

got
new
headmaster
yet
said
Harry
Krum
shrugged
held
out
his
hand
Fleur
had
done
shook
Harry
hand
and
then
Ron
Ron
looked
though
was
suffering
some
sort
painful
internal
struggle
Krum
had
already
started
walking
away
when
Ron
burst
out
Can
have
your
autograph
Hermione
turned
away
smiling
the
horseless
carriages
that
were
now
trundling
toward
them
the
drive
Krum
looking
surprised
but
gratified
signed
fragment
parchment
for
Ron
The
weather
could
not
have
been
more
different
the
journey
back
King
Cross
than
had
been
their
way
Hogwarts
the
previous
September
There
wasn
single
cloud
the
sky
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
managed
get
compartment
themselves
Pigwidgeon
was
once
again
hidden
under
Rons
dress
robes
stop
him
from
hooting
continually
Hedwig
was
dozing
her
head
under
her
wing
and
Crookshanks
was
curled
spare
seat
like
large
furry
ginger
cushion
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
talked
more
fully
and
freely
than
they
had
all
week
the
train
sped
them
southward
Harry
felt
though
Dumbledore
speech
the
Leaving
Feast
had
unblocked
him
somehow
was
less
painful
discuss
what
had
happened
now
They
broke
off
their
conversation
about
what
action
Dumbledore
might
taking
even
now
stop
Voldemort
only
when
the
lunch
trolley
arrived
When
Hermione
returned
from
the
trolley
and
put
her
money
back
into
her
schoolbag
she
dislodged
copy
the
Daily
Prophet
that
she
had
been
carrying
there
Harry
looked
unsure
whether
really
wanted
know
what
might
say
but
Hermione
seeing
him
looking
said
calmly
There
nothing
there
You
can
look
for
yourself
but
there
nothing
all
been
checking
every
day
Just
small
piece
the
day
after
the
third
task
saying
you
won
the
tournament
They
didn
even
mention
Cedric
Nothing
about
any
you
ask
Fudge
forcing
them
keep
quiet
never
keep
Rita
quiet
said
Harry
Not
story
like
this
Rita
hasn
written
anything
all
since
the
third
task
said
Hermione
oddly
constrained
voice
matter
fact
she
added
her
voice
now
trembling
slightly
Rita
Skeeter
isn
going
writing
anything
all
for
while
Not
unless
she
wants
spill
the
beans
her
What
are
you
talking
about
said
Ron
found
out
how
she
was
listening
private
conversations
when
she
wasn
supposed
coming
onto
the
grounds
said
Hermione
rush
Harry
had
the
impression
that
Hermione
had
been
dying
tell
them
this
for
days
but
that
she
had
restrained
herself
light
everything
else
that
had
happened
How
was
she
doing
said
Harry
once
How
did
you
find
out
said
Ron
staring
her
Well
was
you
really
who
gave
the
idea
Harry
she
said
Did
said
Harry
perplexed
How
Bugging
said
Hermione
happily
But
you
said
they
didn
work
not
electronic
bugs
said
Hermione
you
see
Rita
Skeeter
Hermiones
voice
trembled
with
quiet
triumph
unregistered
Animagus
She
can
turn
Hermione
pulled
small
sealed
glass
jar
out
other
bag
into
beetle
You
kidding
said
Ron
You
haven
she
not
yes
she
said
Hermione
happily
brandishing
the
jar
them
Inside
were
few
twigs
and
leaves
and
one
large
fat
beetle
That
never
you
kidding
Ron
whispered
lifting
the
jar
his
eyes
not
said
Hermione
beaming
caught
her
the
windowsill
the
hospital
wing
Look
very
closely
and
you
notice
the
markings
around
her
antennae
are
exactly
like
those
foul
glasses
she
wears
Harry
looked
and
saw
that
she
was
quite
right
also
remembered
something
There
was
beetle
the
statue
the
night
heard
Hagrid
telling
Madame
Maxime
about
his
mum
Exactly
said
Hermione
And
Viktor
pulled
beetle
out
hair
after
had
our
conversation
the
lake
And
unless
very
much
mistaken
Rita
was
perched
the
windowsill
the
Divination
class
the
day
your
scar
hurt
She
been
buzzing
around
for
stories
all
year
When
saw
Malfoy
under
that
tree
said
Ron
slowly
was
talking
her
his
hand
said
Hermione
knew
course
That
how
she
been
getting
all
those
nice
little
interviews
with
the
Slytherins
They
wouldn
care
that
she
was
doing
something
illegal
long
they
were
giving
her
horrible
stuff
about
and
Hagrid
Hermione
took
the
glass
jar
back
from
Ron
and
smiled
the
beetle
which
buzzed
angrily
against
the
glass
told
her
let
her
out
when
get
back
London
said
Hermione
put
Unbreakable
Charm
the
jar
you
see
she
can
transform
And
told
her
she
keep
her
quill
herself
for
whole
year
See
she
can
break
the
habit
writing
horrible
lies
about
people
Smiling
serenely
Hermione
placed
the
beetle
back
inside
her
schoolbag
The
door
the
compartment
slid
open
Very
clever
Granger
said
Draco
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
standing
behind
him
All
three
them
looked
more
pleased
with
themselves
more
arrogant
and
more
menacing
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
them
said
Malfoy
slowly
advancing
slightly
into
the
compartment
and
looking
slowly
around
them
smirk
quivering
his
lips
You
caught
some
pathetic
reporter
and
Potter
Dumbledore
favorite
boy
again
Big
deal
His
smirk
widened
Crabbe
and
Goyle
leered
Trying
not
think
about
are
said
Malfoy
softly
looking
around
all
three
them
Trying
pretend
hasn
happened
Get
out
said
Harry
had
not
been
this
close
Malfoy
since
had
watched
him
muttering
Crabbe
and
Goyle
during
Dumbledores
speech
about
Cedric
could
feel
kind
ringing
his
ears
His
hand
gripped
his
wand
under
his
robes
You
picked
the
losing
side
Potter
warned
you
told
you
you
ought
choose
your
company
more
carefully
remember
When
met
the
train
first
day
Hogwarts
told
you
not
hang
around
with
riffraff
like
this
jerked
his
head
Ron
and
Hermione
Too
late
now
Potter
They
the
first
now
the
Dark
Lord
back
Mudbloods
and
Muggle
lovers
first
Well
second
Diggory
was
the
was
though
someone
had
exploded
box
fireworks
within
the
compartment
Blinded
the
blaze
the
spells
that
had
blasted
from
every
direction
deafened
series
bangs
Harry
blinked
and
looked
down
the
floor
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
all
lying
unconscious
the
doorway
Ron
and
Hermione
were
their
feet
all
three
them
having
used
different
hex
Nor
were
they
the
only
ones
have
done
Thought
see
what
those
three
were
said
Fred
matter
factly
stepping
onto
Goyle
and
into
the
compartment
had
his
wand
out
and
did
George
who
was
careful
tread
Malfoy
followed
Fred
inside
Interesting
effect
said
George
looking
down
Crabbe
Who
used
the
Furnunculus
Curse
said
Harry
Odd
said
George
lightly
used
Jelly
Legs
Looks
though
those
two
shouldn
mixed
seems
have
sprouted
little
tentacles
all
over
his
face
Well
let
not
leave
them
here
they
don
add
much
the
decor
Ron
Harry
and
George
kicked
rolled
and
pushed
the
unconscious
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
each
whom
looked
distinctly
the
worse
for
the
jumble
jinxes
with
which
they
had
been
hit
out
into
the
corridor
then
came
back
into
the
compartment
and
rolled
the
door
shut
Exploding
Snap
anyone
said
Fred
pulling
out
pack
cards
They
were
halfway
through
their
fifth
game
when
Harry
decided
ask
them
You
going
tell
then
said
George
Who
you
were
blackmailing
said
George
darkly
That
doesn
matter
said
Fred
shaking
his
head
impatiently
wasn
anything
important
Not
now
anyway
given
said
George
shrugging
But
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
kept
asking
and
finally
Fred
said
All
right
all
right

really
want
know
was
Ludo
Bagman
Bagman
said
Harry
sharply
Are

saying

involved
Nah
said
George
gloomily
Nothing
like
that
Stupid
git
wouldn
have
the
brains
Well
what
then
said
Ron
Fred
hesitated
then
said
You
remember
that
bet
had
with
him
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
About
how
Ireland
would
win
but
Krum
would
get
the
Snitch
Yeah
said
Harry
and
Ron
slowly
Well

Irish
mascots

Fred
impatiently
vanished

next
morning

But

Hermione
George
laughed
very
bitterly
Yeah

and
told
him

cough
But
nothing

Ignored
our
letter

trying

about
Hogwarts
but

some
excuse

the
end

pretty
nasty
said
Fred
Told

too
young
gamble
and

giving
anything
asked
for
our
money
back
said
George
glowering
didn
refuse
gasped
Hermione
Right

said
Fred
But
that
was
all
your
savings
said
Ron
Tell

said
George
Course
found
out
what
was
going
the
end
Lee
Jordan
dad
had
had
bit
trouble
getting
money

Bagman
well
Turns
out

trouble
with
the
goblins
Borrowed
loads

the
woods
after
the
World
Cup
and

his
debts
They
followed
him
all
the
way
Hogwarts

everything
gambling
Hasn

Galleons

together
And

How

Harry

Fred
Put

trying

Harry
Well

George
shaking
his
head
The
goblins

him
They

with
Diggory
and
Bagman
was
betting
you
win
outright
Bagman
had
run
for
did
run
for
right
after
the
third
task
George
sighed
deeply
and
started
dealing
out
the
cards
again
The
rest
the
journey
passed
pleasantly
enough
Harry
wished
could
have
gone
all
summer
fact
and
that
would
never
arrive
King
Cross
but
had
learned
the
hard
way
that
year
time
will
not
slow
down
when
something
unpleasant
lies
ahead
and
all
too
soon
the
Hogwarts
Express
was
pulling
platform
nine
and
three
quarters
The
usual
confusion
and
noise
filled
the
corridors
the
students
began
disembark
Ron
and
Hermione
struggled
out
past
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
carrying
their
trunks
Harry
however
stayed
put
Fred
George
wait
moment
The
twins
turned
Harry
pulled
open
his
trunk
and
drew
out
his
Triwizard
winnings
Take
said
and
thrust
the
sack
into
George
hands
What
said
Fred
looking
flabbergasted
Take

repeated
firmly

said
George
trying
push
back
Harry

said
Harry
You

Fred
said
almost
awed
voice
Listen
said
Harry
firmly
you
don
take
throwing
down
the
drain
don
want
and
don
need
But
could
with
few
laughs
could
all
with
few
laughs
got
feeling
going
need
them
more
than
usual
before
long
Harry
said
George
weakly
weighing
the
money
bag
his
hands
there
got
thousand
Galleons
here
Yeah
said
Harry
grinning
Think
how
many
Canary
Creams
that
The
twins
stared
him
Just
don
tell
your
mum
where
you
got
although
she
might
not
keen
for
you
join
the
Ministry
anymore
come
think
Harry
Fred
began
but
Harry
pulled
out
his
wand
Look
said
flatly

know
some
good
ones
now
Just
one
favor
okay
Buy
Ron
some
different
dress
robes
and
say
they
from
you
left
the
compartment
before
they
could
say
another
word
stepping
over
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
were
still
lying
the
floor
covered
hex
marks
Uncle
Vernon
was
waiting
beyond
the
barrier
Mrs
Weasley
was
close
him
She
hugged
Harry
very
tightly
when
she
saw
him
and
whispered
his
ear
think
Dumbledore
will
let
you
come
later
the
summer
Keep
touch
Harry
See
you
Harry
said
Ron
clapping
him
the
back
Bye
Harry
said
Hermione
and
she
did
something
she
had
never
done
before
and
kissed
him
the
cheek
Harry
thanks
George
muttered
while
Fred
nodded
fervently
his
side
Harry
winked
them
turned
Uncle
Vernon
and
followed
him
silently
from
the
station
There
was
point
worrying
yet
told
himself
got
into
the
back
the
Dursleys
car
Hagrid
had
said
what
would
come
would
come
and
would
have
meet
