Not

Privet
Drive
Vernon
Dursley
had
been
woken
the
early
hours
the
morning
loud
hooting
noise
from
his
nephew
Harry
room
Third
time
this
week
roared
across
the
table
you
can
control
that
owl
have
Harry
tried
yet
again
explain
She

said
She
used
flying
around

Uncle

what
happen
that
owl
let
out
exchanged
dark
looks
with
his
wife
Petunia
Harry
tried
argue
back
but
his
words
were
drowned
long
loud
belch
from
the
Dursleys
son
Dudley
want
more
bacon
There
more
the
frying
pan
sweetums
said
Aunt
Petunia
turning
misty
eyes
her
massive
son

you
while

the
chance
don
like
the
sound
that
school
food
Nonsense
Petunia
never
went
hungry
when

Smeltings
said
Uncle
Vernon
heartily
Dudley
gets
enough
don
you
son
Dudley
who
was
large
his
bottom
drooped
over
either
side
the
kitchen
chair
grinned
and
turned
Harry
Pass
the
frying
pan
You
forgotten
the
magic
word
said
Harry
irritably
The
effect
this
simple
sentence
the
rest
the
family
was
incredible
Dudley
gasped
and
fell
off
his
chair
with
crash
that
shook
the
whole
kitchen
Mrs
Dursley
gave
small
scream
and
clapped
her
hands
her
mouth
Dursley
jumped
his
feet
veins
throbbing
his
temples
meant
please
said
Harry
quickly
didn
mean
WHAT
HAVE
TOLD
YOU
thundered
his
uncle
spraying
spit
over
the
table
ABOUT
SAYING
THE
WORD
OUR
HOUSE
But
HOW
DARE
YOU
THREATEN
DUDLEY
roared
Uncle
Vernon
pounding
the
table
with
his
fist
just
WARNED
YOU
WILL
NOT
TOLERATE
MENTION
YOUR
ABNORMALITY
UNDER
THIS
ROOF
Harry
stared
from
his
purple
faced
uncle
his
pale
aunt
who
was
trying
heave
Dudley
his
feet
All
right
said
Harry
all
right
Uncle
Vernon
sat
back
down
breathing
like
winded
rhinoceros
and
watching
Harry
closely
out
the
corners
his
small
sharp
eyes
Ever
since
Harry
had
come
home
for
the
summer
holidays
Uncle
Vernon
had
been
treating
him
like
bomb
that
might
off
any
moment
because
Harry
Potter
wasn
normal
boy
matter
fact
was
not
normal
possible
Harry
Potter
was
wizard
wizard
fresh
from
his
first
year
Hogwarts
School
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
And
the
Dursleys
were
unhappy
have
him
back
for
the
holidays
was
nothing
how
Harry
felt
missed
Hogwarts
much
was
like
having
constant
stomachache
missed
the
castle
with
its
secret
passageways
and
ghosts
his
classes
though
perhaps
not
Snape
the
Potions
master
the
mail
arriving
owl
eating
banquets
the
Great
Hall
sleeping
his

poster

the
tower
dormitory
visiting
the
gamekeeper
Hagrid
his
cabin
next
the
Forbidden
Forest
the
grounds
and
especially
Quidditch
the
most
popular
sport
the
wizarding
world
six
tall

four
flying
balls
and
fourteen
players
broomsticks
All
Harry
spellbooks
his
wand
robes
cauldron
and
top
the
line
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
broomstick
had
been
locked
cupboard
under
the
stairs
Uncle
Vernon
the
instant
Harry
had
come
home
What
did
the
Dursleys
care
Harry
lost
his
place
the
House
Quidditch
team
because
hadn
practiced
all
summer
What
was
the
Dursleys
Harry
went
back
school
without
any
his
homework
done
The
Dursleys
were
what
wizards
called
Muggles
not
drop
magical
blood
their
veins
and
far
they
were
concerned
having
wizard
the
family
was
matter
deepest
shame
Uncle
Vernon
had
even
padlocked
Harry
owl
Hedwig
inside
her
cage
stop
her
from
carrying
messages
anyone
the
wizarding
world
Harry
looked
nothing
like
the
rest
the
family
Uncle
Vernon
was
large
and
neckless
with
enormous
black
mustache
Aunt
Petunia
was
horse
faced
and
bony
Dudley
was
blond
pink
and
porky
Harry
the
other
hand
was
small
and
skinny
with
brilliant
green
eyes
and
jet
black
hair
that
was
always
untidy
wore
round
glasses
and
his
forehead
was
thin
lightning
shaped
scar
was
this
scar
that
made
Harry
particularly
unusual
even
for
wizard
This
scar
was
the
only
hint
Harry
very
mysterious
past
the
reason
had
been
left
the
Dursleys
doorstep
eleven
years
before
the
age
one
year
old
Harry
had
somehow
survived
curse
from
the
greatest
Dark
sorcerer
all
time
Lord
Voldemort
whose
name
most
witches
and
wizards
still
feared
speak
Harry
parents
had
died
Voldemort
attack
but
Harry
had
escaped
with
his
lightning
scar
and
somehow
nobody
understood
why
Voldemort
powers
had
been
destroyed
the
instant
had
failed
kill
Harry
Harry
had
been
brought
his
dead
mother
sister
and
her
husband
had
spent
ten
years
with
the
Dursleys
never
understanding
why
kept
making
odd
things
happen
without
meaning
believing
the
Dursleys
story
that
had
got
his
scar
the
car
crash
that
had
killed
his
parents
And
then
exactly
year
ago
Hogwarts
had
written
Harry
and
the
whole
story
had
come
out
Harry
had
taken
his
place
wizard
school
where
and
his
scar
were
famous
but
now
the
school
year
was
over
and
was
back
with
the
Dursleys
for
the
summer
back
being
treated
like
dog
that
had
rolled
something
smelly
The
Dursleys
hadn
even
remembered
that
today
happened
Harry
twelfth
birthday
course
his
hopes
hadn
been
high
they
never
given
him
real
present
let
alone
cake
but
ignore
completely
that
moment
Uncle
Vernon
cleared
his
throat
importantly
and
said
Now
all
know
today
very
important
day
Harry
looked
hardly
daring
believe
This
could
well
the
day
make
the
biggest
deal
career
said
Uncle
Vernon
Harry
went
back
his
toast
course
thought
bitterly
cle
Vernon
was
talking
about
the
stupid
dinner
party
been
talk
ing
nothing
else
for
two
weeks
Some
rich
builder
and
his
wife
were
coming

and
Uncle
Vernon
was
hoping
get
huge
order
from
him
Uncle
Vernon

Aunt

simpering
smile
May

Aunt
Petunia
rapturously

said
Uncle

Then

This
was
too
much
for
both
Aunt
Petunia
and
Harry
Aunt
Petunia
burst
into
tears
and
hugged
her
son
while
Harry
ducked
under
the
table
they
wouldn
see
him
laughing
And
you
boy
Harry
fought
keep
his
face
straight
emerged
room
making
noise
and
pretending
not
there
said
Too

said
Uncle
Vernon
forcefully
The
sons

that
way
When

you
take
Mrs

Petunia
and
bring

With
any
luck

and
sealed
before
the
news
ten
shopping
for
vacation
home
Majorca
this
time
morrow
Harry
couldn
feel
too
excited
about
this
didn
think
the
Dursleys
would
like
him
any
better
Majorca
than
they
did
Privet
Drive
Right
off
into
town
pick
the
dinner
jackets
for
Dudley
and
And
you
snarled
Harry
You
stay
out
your
aunt
way
while
she
cleaning
Harry
left
through
the
back
door
was
brilliant
sunny
day
crossed
the
lawn
slumped
down
the
garden
bench
and
sang
under
his
breath
Happy
birthday
happy
birthday
cards
presents
and
would
spending
the
evening
pretending
not
exist
gazed
miserably
into
the
hedge
had
never
felt
lonely
More
than
anything
else
Hogwarts
more
even
than
playing
Quidditch
Harry
missed
his
best
friends
Ron
Weasley
and
Hermione
Granger
They
however
didn
seem
missing
him
all
Neither
them
had
written
him
all
summer
even
though
Ron
had
said
was
going
ask
Harry
come
and
stay
Countless
times
Harry
had
been
the
point
unlocking
Hedwig
cage
magic
and
sending
her
Ron
and
Hermione
with
letter
but
wasn
worth
the
risk
Underage
wizards
weren
allowed
use
magic
outside
school
Harry
hadn
told
the
Dursleys
this
knew
was
only
their
terror
that
might
turn
them
all
into
dung
beetles
that
stopped
them
from
locking
him
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
with
his
wand
and
broomstick
For
the
first
couple
weeks
back
Harry
had
enjoyed
muttering
nonsense
words
under
his
breath
and
watching
Dudley
tearing
out
the
room
fast
his
fat
legs
would
carry
him
But
the
long
silence
from
Ron
and
Hermione
had
made
Harry
feel
cut
off
from
the
magical
world
that
even
taunting
Dudley
had
lost
its
appeal
and
now
Ron
and
Hermione
had
forgotten
his
birthday
What
wouldn
give
now
for
message
from
Hogwarts
From
any
witch
wizard
almost
glad
sight
his
archenemy
Draco
Malfoy
just
sure
hadn
all
been
dream
Not
that
his
whole
year
Hogwarts
had
been
fun
the
very
end
last
term
Harry
had
come
face
face
with
none
other
than
Lord
Voldemort
himself
Voldemort
might
ruin
his
former
self
but
was
still
terrifying
still
cunning
still
determined
regain
power
Harry
had
slipped
through
Voldemort
clutches
for
second
time
but
had
been
narrow
escape
and
even
now
weeks
later
Harry
kept
waking
the
night
drenched
cold
sweat
wondering
where
Voldemort
was
now
remembering
his
livid
face
his
wide
mad
eyes
Harry
suddenly
sat
bolt
upright
the
garden
bench
had
been
staring
absent
mindedly
into
the
hedge
and
the
hedge
was
staring
back
Two
enormous
green
eyes
had
appeared
among
the
leaves
Harry
jumped
his
feet
just
jeering
voice
floated
across
the
lawn
know
what
day
sang
Dudley
waddling
toward
him
The
huge
eyes
blinked
and
vanished
What
said
Harry
not
taking
his
eyes
off
the
spot
where
they
had
been
know
what
day
Dudley
repeated
coming
right
him
Well
done
said
Harry
you
finally
learned
the
days
the
week
Today
your
birthday
sneered
Dudley
How
come
you
haven
got
any
cards
Haven
you
even
got
friends
that
freak
place
Better
not
let
your
mum
hear
you
talking
about
school
said
Harry
coolly
Dudley
hitched
his
trousers
which
were
slipping
down
his
fat
bottom
Why
you
staring
the
hedge
said
suspiciously
trying
decide
what
would
the
best
spell
set
fire
said
Harry
Dudley
stumbled
backward
once
look
panic
his
fat
face
You
can
Dad
told
you
you
not
magic
said
chuck
you
out
the
house
and
you
haven
got
anywhere
else
you
haven
got
any
friends
take
you
Jiggery
pokery
said
Harry
fierce
voice
Hocus
pocus
squiggly
wiggly
MUUUUUUM
howled
Dudley
tripping
over
his
feet
dashed
back
toward
the
house
MUUUUM
doing
you
know
what
Harry
paid
dearly
for
his
moment
fun
neither
Dudley
nor
the
hedge
was
any
way
hurt
Aunt
Petunia
knew
hadn
really
done
magic
but
still
had
duck
she
aimed
heavy
blow
his
head
with
the
soapy
frying
pan
Then
she
gave
him
work
with
the
promise
wouldn
eat
again
until
finished
While
Dudley
lolled
around
watching
and
eating
ice
cream
Harry
cleaned
the
windows
washed
the
car
mowed
the
lawn
trimmed
the
flowerbeds
pruned
and
watered
the
roses
and
repainted
the
garden
bench
The
sun
blazed
overhead
burning
the
back
his
neck
Harry
knew
shouldn
have
risen
Dudley
bait
but
Dudley
had
said
the
very
thing
Harry
had
been
thinking
himself
maybe
didn
have
any
friends
Hogwarts
Wish
they
could
see
famous
Harry
Potter
now
thought
savagely
spread
manure
the
flower
beds
his
back
aching
sweat
running
down
his
face
was
half
past
seven
the
evening
when
last
exhausted
heard
Aunt
Petunia
calling
him
Get
here
And
walk
the
newspaper
Harry
moved
gladly
into
the
shade
the
gleaming
kitchen
top
the
fridge
stood
tonight
pudding
huge
mound
whipped
cream
and
sugared
violets
loin
roast
pork
was
sizzling
the
oven
Eat
quickly
The
Masons
will
here
soon
snapped
Aunt
Petunia
pointing
two
slices
bread
and
lump
cheese
the
kitchen
table
She
was
already
wearing
salmon
pink
cocktail
dress
Harry
washed
his
hands
and
bolted
down
his
pitiful
supper
The
moment
had
finished
Aunt
Petunia
whisked
away
his
plate
Upstairs
Hurry
passed
the
door
the
living
room
Harry
caught
glimpse
Uncle
Vernon
and
Dudley
bow
ties
and
dinner
jack
ets
had
only
just
reached
the
upstairs
landing
when
the
door
bell
rang
and
Uncle
Vernon
furious
face
appeared
the
foot
the
stairs
Remember
boy
one
sound
Harry
crossed
his
bedroom
tiptoe
slipped
inside
closed
the
door
and
turned
collapse
his
bed
The
trouble
was
there
was
already
someone
sitting
DOBBY
WARNING
arry
managed
not
shout
out
but
was
close
thing
The
little
creature
the
bed
had
large
bat
like
ears
and
bulging
green
eyes
the
size
tennis
balls
Harry
knew
instantly
that
this
was
what
had
been
watching
him
out
the
garden
hedge
that
morning
they
stared
each
other
Harry
heard
Dudley
voice
from
the
hall
May
take
your
coats
and
Mrs
Mason
The
creature
slipped
off
the
bed
and
bowed
low
that
the
end
its
long
thin
nose
touched
the
carpet
Harry
noticed
that
was
wearing
what
looked
like
old
pillowcase
with
rips
for
arm
and
leg
holes
hello
said
Harry
nervously
Harry
Potter
said
the
creature
high
pitched
voice
Harry
was

carry
down
the
stairs
long
has
Dobby

Harry
edging
along
the
wall
and
sinking
into
his
desk
chair
next
Hedwig
who
was
asleep
her
large
cage
wanted
ask
What

Harry
trying

and
look

onto
the
bed

himself
and
sat
with
his
great
eyes

Harry
expression

adoration

said
Harry
trying
cheer
him
Dobby
shook
his
head
Then
without
warning
leapt
and
started
banging
his
head
furiously
the
window
shouting
Bad
Dobby

Harry
hissed
springing
and
pulling
Dobby
back
onto
the

loud
screech
and
was
beating
her
wings
wildly
against

her

This

Thinking

too
Dobby
leaned
toward
Harry
his
eyes
wide
headlights
Dobby
heard
tell
said
hoarsely
that
Harry
Potter
met
the
Dark
Lord
for

time
just
weeks

that

Yet

Harry
nodded
and
Dobby

over
Dobby

What

Harry
once
Who

Dobby

noise
and
then

against
the
wall
All

Harry

the
wall
again
Slowly
Dobby
shook
his
head
Not

But
Dobby
eyes
were
wide
and
seemed
trying
give
Harry
hint
Harry
however
was
completely
lost

Dobby
shook
his
head
his
eyes
wider
than

Well

things
happen
Hogwarts

Harry

Dobby

urgent
whisper

And
before
Harry
could
stop
him
Dobby
bounded
off
the
bed
seized
Harry
desk
lamp
and
started
beating
himself
around
the
head
with
earsplitting
yelps
sudden
silence
fell
downstairs
Two
seconds
later
Harry
heart
thudding
madly
heard
Uncle
Vernon
coming
into
the
hall
calling
Dudley

Quick

Uncle

Harry

One

Shaking
Harry

the

Stepping

Hagrid
Dobby

anxiously

Dobby

said
Harry
angrily
Give

Then
Harry
Potter

Dobby
choice
said
the
elf
sadly
Before
Harry
could
move
Dobby
had
darted
the
bedroom
door
pulled
open
and
sprinted
down
the
stairs
Mouth
dry
stomach
lurching
Harry
sprang
after
him
trying
not
make
sound
jumped
the
last
six
steps
landing
catlike
the
hall
carpet
looking
around
for
Dobby
From
the
dining
room
heard
Uncle
Vernon
saying
tell
Petunia
that
very
funny
story
about
those
American
plumbers
Mason
She
been
dying
hear
Harry
ran
the
hall
into
the
kitchen
and
felt
his
stomach
disappear
Aunt
Petunia
masterpiece
pudding
the
mountain
cream
and
sugared
violets
was
floating
near
the
ceiling
top
cupboard
the
corner
crouched
Dobby
croaked
Harry
Please
they
kill
Harry
Potter
must
say
not
going
back
school
Dobby
please
Say
sir
can
Dobby
gave
him
tragic
look
Then
Dobby
must
sir
for
Harry
Potter
own
good
The
pudding
fell
the
floor
with
heart
stopping
crash
Cream
splattered
the
windows
and
walls
the
dish
shattered
With
crack
like
whip
Dobby
vanished
There
were
screams
from
the
dining
room
and
Uncle
Vernon
burst
into
the
kitchen
find
Harry
rigid
with
shock
covered
from
head
foot
Aunt
Petunias
pudding
first
looked
though
Uncle
Vernon
would
manage
gloss
the
whole
thing
over
Just
our
nephew
very
disturbed
meeting
strangers
upsets
him
kept
him
upstairs
shooed
the
shocked
Masons
back
into
the
dining
room
promised
Harry
would
flay
him
within
inch
his
life
when
the
sons
had
left
and
handed
him
mop
Aunt
Petunia
dug
some
ice
cream
out
the
freezer
and
Harry
still
shaking
started
scrubbing
the
kitchen
clean
Uncle
Vernon
might
still
have
been
able
make
his
deal
hadn
been
for
the
owl
Aunt
Petunia
was
just
passing
around
box
after
dinner
mints
when
huge
barn
owl
swooped
through
the
dining
room
window
dropped
letter
Mrs
Mason
head
and
swooped
out
again
Mrs
Mason
screamed
like
banshee
and
ran
from
the
house
shouting
about
lunatics
Mason
stayed
just
long
enough
tell
the
Dursleys
that
his
wife
was
mortally
afraid
birds
all
shapes
and
sizes
and
ask
whether
this
was
their
idea
joke
Harry
stood
the
kitchen
clutching
the
mop
for
support
Uncle
Vernon
advanced
him
demonic
glint
his
tiny
eyes
Read
hissed
evilly
brandishing
the
letter
the
owl
had
delivered
read
Harry
took
did
not
contain

Ministry
Magic
Harry
looked
from
the
letter
and
gulped
You
didn
tell
you
weren
allowed
use
magic
outside
school
said
Uncle
Vernon
mad
gleam
dancing
his
eyes
For
got
mention
Slipped
your
mind
daresay
was
bearing
down
Harry
like
great
bulldog
all
his
teeth
bared
Well
got
news
for
you
boy
locking
you
You
never
going
back
that
school
never
and
you
try
and
magic
yourself
out
they
expel
you
And
laughing
like
maniac
dragged
Harry
back
upstairs
Uncle
Vernon
was
bad
his
word
The
following
morning
paid
man
fit
bars
Harry
window
himself
fitted
cat
flap
the
bedroom
door
that
small
amounts
food
could
pushed
inside
three
times
day
They
let
Harry
out
use
the
bathroom
morning
and
evening
Otherwise
was
locked
his
room
around
the
clock
Three
days
later
the
Dursleys
were
showing
sign
relenting
and
Harry
couldn
see
any
way
out
his
situation
lay
his
bed
watching
the
sun
sinking
behind
the
bars
the
window
and
wondered
miserably
what
was
going
happen
him
What
was
the
good
magicking
himself
out
his
room
Hogwarts
would
expel
him
for
doing
Yet
life
Privet
Drive
had
reached
all
time
low
Now
that
the
Dursleys
knew
they
weren
going
wake
fruit
bats
had
lost
his
only
weapon
Dobby
might
have
saved
Harry
from
horrible
happenings
Hogwarts
but
the
way
things
were
going
probably
starve
death
anyway
The
cat
flap
rattled
and
Aunt
Petunias
hand
appeared
pushing
bowl
canned
soup
into
the
room
Harry
whose
insides
were
aching
with
hunger
jumped
off
his
bed
and
seized
The
soup
was
stone
cold
but
drank
half
one
gulp
Then
crossed
the
room
Hedwig
cage
and
tipped
the
soggy
vegetables
the
bottom
the
bowl
into
her
empty
food
tray
She
ruffled
her
feathers
and
gave
him
look
deep
disgust
good
turning
your
beak
that
all
got
said
Harry
grimly
put
the
empty
bowl
back
the
floor
next
the
cat
flap
and
lay
back
down
the
bed
somehow
even
hungrier
than
had
been
before
the
soup
Supposing
was
still
alive
another
four
weeks
what
would
happen
didn
turn
Hogwarts
Would
someone
sent
see
why
hadn
come
back
Would
they
able
make
the
Dursleys
let
him
The
room
was
growing
dark
Exhausted
stomach
rumbling
mind
spinning
over
the
same
unanswerable
questions
Harry
fell
into
uneasy
sleep
dreamed
that
was
show
zoo
with
card
reading
UNDERAGE
WIZARD
attached
his
cage
People
goggled
through
the
bars
him
lay
starving
and
weak
bed
straw
saw
Dobby
face
the
crowd
and
shouted
out
asking
for
help
but
Dobby
called
Harry
Potter
safe
there
sir
and
vanished
Then
the
Dursleys
appeared
and
Dudley
rattled
the
bars
the
cage
laughing
him
Stop
Harry
muttered
the
rattling
pounded
his
sore
head
Leave
alone
cut
out
trying
sleep
opened
his
eyes
Moonlight
was
shining
through
the
bars
the
window
And
someone
was
goggling
through
the
bars
him
freckle
faced
red
haired
long
nosed
someone
Ron
Weasley
was
outside
Harry
window
THE
BURROW
Ron
breathed
Harry
creeping
the
window
and
pushing
they
could
talk
through
the
bars
Ron
how
did
you
What
the
Harry
mouth
fell
open
the
full
impact
what
was
seeing
hit
him
Ron
was
leaning
out
the
back
window
old
turquoise
car
which
was
parked
midair
Grinning
Harry
from
the
front
seats
were
Fred
and
George
Ron
elder
twin
brothers
All
right
Harry
asked
George
What
been
going
said
Ron
Why
haven
you
been
answering
letters
asked
you

about
twelve
times
and
then
Dad
came
home
and
said
you
got
official
warning
for

and
how

know

the
Ministry
said
Ron
You

not
supposed
spells

school
You
should
talk
said
Harry
staring
the
floating
car
this
doesn
count
said
Ron
only
borrowing
this
Dad
didn
enchant
But
doing
magic
front
those
Muggles
you
live
with
told
you
didn
but
take
too
long
explain
now
look
can
you
tell
them
Hogwarts
that
the
Dursleys
have
locked
and
won
let
come
back
and
obviously
can
magic
myself
out
because
the
Ministry
think
that

days
Stop

said
Ron
come
take
you
home
with
But

said
Ron
jerking
his
head
toward
the
front
seat
and
grinning
You

Tie

Fred

Harry

Dursleys

Harry
tied
the
rope
tightly
around
bar
and
Fred
revved
the
car
Don
worry
said
Fred
and
stand
back
Harry
moved
back
into
the
shadows
next
Hedwig
who
seemed
have
realized
how
important
this
was
and
kept
still
and
silent
The
car
revved
louder
and
louder
and
suddenly
with
crunching
noise
the
bars
were
pulled
clean
out
the
window
Fred
drove
straight
the
air
Harry
ran
back
the
window
see
the
bars
dangling
few
feet
above
the
ground
Panting
Ron
hoisted
them
into
the
car
Harry
listened
anxiously
but
there
was
sound
from
the
Dursleys
bedroom
When
the
bars
were
safely

back
seat

Ron
Fred

George
from

Out

Harry
Fred

climbed
catlike
through
the
window
into
Harry

said
Fred
but
feel

There
was
small
click
and
the
door
swung
open

your
room
and
hand

Ron
whispered
George
Watch

Harry
whispered
back

onto
the
dark

Harry
dashed
around

his
things
and
passing
them
out

Ron
Then
went

Fred
climbed
back
into
the
car

with
Ron
and
Harry
and
George
pushed
from

Inch

the

slid
through

Uncle
Vernon
coughed
again

more
panted
Fred
who
was
pulling
from
inside
the
car
One
good
push
Harry
and
George
threw
their
shoulders
against
the
trunk
and
slid
out
the
window
into
the
back
seat
the
car
Okay

George
whispered
But
Harry
climbed
onto
the
windowsill

from
behind

Ron
was
scrambling
back
onto

when
Uncle
Vernon
hammered
the
unlocked
door
and
crashed
open
For
split
second
Uncle
Vernon
stood
framed
the
doorway
then
let
out
bellow
like
angry
bull
and
dived
Harry

Ron

down

whipping
his
hair
and
looked
back

shrinking
rooftops
Privet

Uncle
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia

Dudley
were
all
hanging
dumbstruck
out
Harry
window
See

The

with
laughter
and
Harry
settled

Harry

Malfoy

had
the
best
everything

wizard
gold
could
just
see
Malfoy
strutting
around
large

house
Sending

Harry
from

exactly

thing

Ron

What

The

berserk
and
squirted

That

said
George
peering
down
through
the
windshield
there
ten
minutes
Just
well
getting
light
faint
pinkish
glow
was
visible
along
the
horizon
the
east
Fred
brought
the
car
lower
and
Harry
saw
dark
patchwork
fields
and
clumps
trees
little
way
outside
the
village
said
George
Ottery
Catchpole
Lower
and
lower
went
the
flying
car
The
edge
brilliant
red
sun
was
now
gleaming
through
the
trees
Touchdown
said
Fred
with
slight
bump
they
hit
the
ground
They
had
landed
next
tumbledown
garage
small
yard
and
Harry
looked
out
for
the
first
time
Ron
house
looked
though
had
once
been
large
stone
pigpen
but
extra
rooms
had
been
added
here
and
there
until
was
several
stories
high
and
crooked
looked
though
were
held
magic
which
Harry
reminded
himself
probably
was
Four
five
chimneys
were
perched
top
the
red
roof
lopsided
sign
stuck
the
ground
near
the
entrance
read
THE
BuRRow
Around
the
front
door
lay
jumble
rubber
boots
and
very
rusty
cauldron
Several
fat
brown
chickens
were
pecking
their
way
around
the
yard
not
much
said
Ron
wonderful
said
Harry
happily
thinking
Privet
Drive
They
got
out
the
car
Now
upstairs
really
quietly
said
Fred
and
wait
for
Mum
call
for
breakfast
Then
Ron
you
come
bounding
downstairs
going
Mum
look
who
turned
the
night
and
she
all
pleased

Harry
and
one
need

flew
the
car
Right
said
Ron
Come
Harry
sleep
the
the
top
Ron
had
gone
nasty
greenish
color
his
eyes
fixed
the
house
The
other
three
wheeled
around
Mrs
Weasley
was
marching
across
the
yard
scattering
chickens
and
for
short
plump
kind
faced
woman
was
remarkable
how
much
she
looked
like
saber
toothed
tiger
said
Fred
dear
said
George
Mrs
Weasley
came
halt
front
them
her
hands
her
hips
staring
from
one
guilty
face
the
next
She
was
wearing
flowered
apron
with
wand
sticking
out
the
pocket
she
said
Morning
Mum
said
George
what
clearly
thought
was
jaunty
winning
voice
Have
you
any
idea
how
worried
been
said
Mrs
Weasley
deadly
whisper
Sorry
Mum
but
see
had
All
three
Mrs
Weasley
sons
were
taller
than
she
was
but
they
cowered
her
rage
broke
over
them
Beds
empty
note
Cargone
could
have
crashed
out
mind
with
worry
did
you
care
never
long
lived
you
wait
until
your
father
gets
home
never
had
trouble
like
this
from
Bill
Charlie
Percy
Perfect
Percy
muttered
Fred
YOU
COULD
WITH
TAKING
LEAF
OUT
PERCY
BOOK
yelled
Mrs
Weasley
prodding
finger
Fred
chest
You
could
have
died
you
could
have
been
seen
you
could
have
lost
your
father
his
job
seemed
for
hours
Mrs
Weasley
had
shouted
herself
hoarse
before
she
turned
Harry
who
backed
away
very
pleased
see
you
Harry
dear
she
said
Come
and
have
some
breakfast
She
turned
and
walked
back
into
the
house
and
Harry
after
nervous
glance
Ron
who
nodded
encouragingly
followed
her
The
kitchen
was
small
and
rather
cramped
There
was
scrubbed
wooden
table
and
chairs
the
middle
and
Harry
sat
down
the
edge
his
seat
looking
around
had
never
been
wizard
house
before
The
clock
the
wall
opposite
him
had
only
one
hand
and
numbers
all
Written
around
the
edge
were
things
like
Time
make
tea
Time
feed
the
chickens
and
You
late
Books
were
stacked
three
deep
the
mantelpiece
books
with
titles
like
Charm
Your
Own
Cheese
Enchantment
Baking
and
One
Minute
Feasts
Magic
And
unless
Harry
ears
were
deceiving
him
the
old
radio
next
the
sink
had
just
announced
that
coming
was
Witching
Hour
with
the
popular
singing
sorceress
Celestina
Warbeck
Mrs
Weasley
was
clattering
around
cooking
breakfast
little
haphazardly
throwing
dirty
looks
her
sons
she
threw
sausages
into
the
frying
pan
Every
now
and
then
she
muttered
things
like
don
know
what
you
were
thinking
and
never
would
have
believed
don
blame
you
dear
she
assured
Harry
tipping
eight
nine
sausages
onto
his
plate
Arthur

been
worried
about
you
too
Just
last
night
were
saying
come
and
get
you
ourselves
you
hadn
written
back
Ron
Friday
But
really
she
was
now
adding
three
fried
eggs
his
plate
flying
illegal
car
halfway
across
the
country
anyone
could
have
seen
you
She
flicked
her
wand
casually
the
dishes
the
sink
which
began
clean
themselves
clinking
gently
the
background
was
cloudy
Mum
said
Fred
You
keep
your
mouth
closed
while
you
eating
Mrs
Weasley
snapped
They
were
starving
him
Mum
said
George
And
you
said
Mrs
Weasley
but
was
with
slightly
softened
expression
that
she
started
cutting
Harry
bread
and
buttering
for
him
that
moment
there
was
diversion
the
form
small
redheaded
figure
long
nightdress
who
appeared
the
kitchen
gave
small
squeal
and
ran
out
again
Ginny
said
Ron
undertone
Harry
sister
She
been
talking
about
you
all
summer
Yeah
she
wanting
your
autograph
Harry
Fred
said
with
grin
but
caught
his
mother
eye
and
bent
his
face
over
his
plate
without
another
word
Nothing
more
was
said
until
all
four
plates
were
clean
which
took
surprisingly
short
time
Blimey
tired
yawned
Fred
setting
down
his
knife
and
fork
last
think
bed
and
You
will

snapped
Mrs
Weasley
your
own
fault

she
said
glaring
Ron
and
Fred
You

she
added
Harry
You
didn
ask
them

that
wretched
car
But
Harry
who
felt
wide
awake
said
quickly
help
Ron
never
seen
gnoming
That
very
sweet
you
dear
but
dull
work
said
Mrs
Weasley
Now
let
see
what
Lockhart
got
say
the
subject
And
she
pulled
heavy
book
from
the
stack
the
mantelpiece
George
groaned
Mum

how
gnome
garden
Harry
looked
the
cover
Mrs
Weasley
book
Written
across
fancy
gold
letters
were
the
words
Gilderoy
Lockhart
Guide
Household
Pests
There
was
big
photograph
the
front
very
good
IOI
king
wizard
with
wavy
blond
hair
and
bright
blue
eyes
always
the
wizarding
world
the
photograph
was
moving
the
wizard
who
Harry
supposed
was
Gilderoy
Lockhart
kept
winking
cheekily
them
all
Mrs
Weasley
beamed
down
him
marvelous
she
said
knows
his
household
pests
all
right
wonderful
book
Mum
fancies
him
said
Fred
very
audible
whisper
Don
ridiculous
Fred
said
Mrs
Weasley
her
cheeks
rather
pink
All
right
you
think
you
know
better
than
Lockhart
you
can
and
get
with
and
woe
betide
you
there
single
gnome
that
garden
when
come
out
inspect
Yawning
and
grumbling
the
Weasleys
slouched
outside
with
Harry
behind
them
The
garden
was
large
and
Harry
eyes
exactlY
what
garden
should
The
Dursleys
wouldn
have
liked
there
were
plenty
weeds
and
the
grass
needed
cutting
but
there
were
gnarled
trees
all
around
the
walls
plants
Harry
had
never
seen
spilling
from
every
flower
bed
and
big
green
pond
full
frogs
Muggles
have
garden
gnomes
too
you
know
Harry
told
Ron
they
crossed
the
lawn
Yeah
seen
those
things
they
think
are
gnomes
said
Ron
bent
double
with
his
head
peony
bush
like
fat
little
Santa
Clauses
with
fishing
rods
There
was
violent
scuffling
noise
the
peony
bush
shuddered
and
Ron
straightened
This
gnome
said
grimly
Gerroff
Gerroff
squealed
the
gnome
was
certainly
nothing
like
Santa
Claus
was
small
and
leathery
looking
with
large
knobby
bald
head
exactly
like
potato
Ron
held
arm
length
kicked
out
him
with
its
horny
little
feet
grasped
around
the
ankles
and
turned
upside
down
This
what
you
have
said
raised
the
gnome
above
his
head
Gerroff
and
started
swing
great
circles
like
lasso
Seeing
the
shocked
look
Harry
face
Ron
added
doesn
hurt
them
you
just
got
make
them
really
dizzy
they
can
find
their
way
back
the
gnomeholes
let
the
gnome
ankles
flew
twenty
feet
into
the
air
and
landed
with
thud
the
field
over
the
hedge
Pitiful
said
Fred
bet
can
get
mine
beyond
that
stump
Harry
learned
quickly
not
feel
too
sorry
for
the
gnomes
decided
just
drop
the
first
one
caught
over
the
hedge
but
the
gnome
sensing
weakness
sank
its
razor
sharp
teeth
into
Harry
finger
and
had
hard
job
shaking
off
until
Wow
Harry
that
must
been
fifty
feet
The
air
was
soon
thick
with
flying
gnomes
See
they
not
too
bright
said
George
seizing
five
six
gnomes
once
The
moment
they
know
the
gnoming
going
they
storm
have
look
You
think
they
have
learned
now
just
stay
put
Soon
the
crowd
gnomes
the
field
started
walking
away
straggling
line
their
little
shoulders
hunched
They
back
said
Ron
they
watched
the
gnomes
disappear
into
the
hedge
the
other
side
the
field
They
love
here
Dad
too
soft
with
them
thinks
they
funny
Just
then
the
front
door
slammed
back
said
George
Dad
home
They
hurried
through
the
garden
and
back
into
the
house
Weasley
was
slumped
kitchen
chair
with
his
glasses
off
and
his
eyes
closed
was
thin
man
going
bald
but
the
little
hair
had
was
red
any
his
children
was
wearing
long
green
robes
which
were
dusty
and
travel
worn
What
night
mumbled
groping
for
the
teapot
they
all
sat
down
around
him
Nine
raids
Nine
And
old
Mundungus
Fletcher
tried
put
hex
when
had
back
turned
Weasley
took
long
gulp
tea
and
sighed
Find
anything
Dad
said
Fred
eagerly
All
got
were
few
shrinking
door
keys
and
biting
kettle
yawned
Weasley
There
was
some
pretty
nasty
stuff
that
wasn
department
though
Mortlake
was
taken
away
for
questioning
about
some
extremely
odd
ferrets
but
that
the
Committee
Experimental
Charms
thank
goodness
Why
would
anyone
bother
making
door
keys
shrink
said
George
Just
Muggle
baiting
sighed
Weasley
Sell
them
key
that
keeps
shrinking
nothing
they
can
never
find
when
they
need
course
very
hard
convict
anyone
because
Muggle
would
admit
their
key
keeps
shrinking
they
insist
they
just
keep
losing
Bless
them
they
any
lengths
ignore
magic
even
staring
them
the
face
But
the
things
our
lot
have
taken
enchanting
you
wouldn
believe
LIKE
CARS
FOR
INSTANCE
Mrs
Weasley
had
appeared
holding
long
poker
like
sword
Weasley
eyes
jerked
open
stared
guiltily
his
wife
cars
Molly
dear
Yes
Arthur
cars
said
Mrs
Weasley
her
eyes
flashing
Imagine
wizard
buying
rusty
old
car
and
telling
his
wife
all
wanted
with
was
take
apart
see
how
worked
while
really
was
enchanting
make
fly
Weasley
blinked
Well
dear
think
you
find
that
would
quite
within
the
law
that
even
maybe
would
have
done
better
tell
his
wife
the
truth
There
loophole
the
law
you
find
long
wasn
intending
fly
the
car
the
fact
that
the
car
could
fly
wouldn
Arthur
Weasley
you
made
sure
there
was
loophole
when
you
wrote
that
law
shouted
Mrs
Weasley
Just
you
could
carry
tinkering
with
all
that
Muggle
rubbish
your
shed
And
for
your
information
Harry
arrived
this
morning
the
car
you
weren
intending
fly
Harry
said
Weasley
blankly
Harry
who
looked
around
saw
Harry
and
jumped
Good
lord
Harry
Potter
Very
pleased
meet
you
Ron
told
much
about
Your
sons
flew
that
car
Harry
house
and
back
last
night
shouted
Mrs
Weasley
What
have
you
got
say
about
that
Did
you
really
said
Weasley
eagerly
Did
all
right
mean
faltered
sparks
flew
from
Mrs
Weasley
eyes
that
that
was
very
wrong
boys
very
wrong
indeed
Let
leave
them
Ron
muttered
Harry
Mrs
Weasley
swelled
like
bullfrog
Come
show
you
bedroom
They
slipped
out
the
kitchen
and
down
narrow
passageway
uneven
staircase
which
wound
its
way
zigzagging
through
the
house
the
third
landing
door
stood
ajar
Harry
just
caught
sight
pair
bright
brown
eyes
staring
him
before
closed
with
snap
Ginny
said
Ron
You
don
know
how
weird
for
her
this
shy
She
never
shuts
normally
They
climbed
two
more
flights
until
they
reached
door
with
peeling
paint
and
small
plaque
saying
RONALD
ROOM
Harry
stepped
his
head
almost
touching
the
sloping
ceiling
and
blinked
was
like
walking
into
furnace
Nearly
everything
Ron
room
seemed
violent
shade
orange
the
bedspread
the
walls
even
the
ceiling
Then
Harry
realized
that
Ron
had
covered
nearly
every
inch
the

Harry
stepped
over

Self
Shuffling
playing
cards
the
floor
and
looked
out
the
tiny
window
the
field
far
below
could
see
gang
gnomes
sneaking
one
one
back
through
the
Weasleys
hedge
Then
turned
look
Ron
who
was
watching
him
almost
nervously
though
waiting
for
his
opinion
bit
small
said
Ron
quickly
Not
like
that
room
you
had
with
the
Muggles
And
right
underneath
the
ghoul
the
attic
always
banging
the
pipes
and
groaning
But
Harry
grinning
widely
said
This
the
best
house
ever
been
Ron
ears
went
pink
AND
BLOTTS
ife
the
Burrow
was
different
possible
from
life
Privet
Drive
The
Dursleys
liked
everything
neat
and
ordered
the
Weasleys
house
burst
with
the
strange
and
unexpected
Harry
got
shock
the
first
time
looked
the
mirror
over
the
kitchen
mantelpiece
and
shouted
Tuck
your
shirt
scruffy
The
ghoul
the
attic
howled
and
dropped
pipes
whenever
felt
things
were
getting
too
quiet
and
small
explosions
from
Fred
and
George
bedroom
were
considered
perfectly
normal
What
Harry
found
most
unusual
about
life
Ron
however
wasn
the
talking
mirror
the
clanking
ghoul
was
the
fact
that
everybody
there
seemed
like
him
Mrs
Weasley
fussed
over
the
state
his
socks
and
tried
force
him
eat
fourth
helpings
every
meal
Weasley
liked
Harry
sit
next
him
the
dinner
table
that
could
bombard
him
with
questions
about
life
with
Muggles
asking
him
explain
how
things
like
plugs
and
the
postal
service
worked
Fascinating
would
say
Harry
talked
him
through
using
telephone
Ingenious
really
how
many
ways
Muggles
have
found
getting
along
without
magic
Harry
heard
from
Hogwarts
one
sunny
morning
about
week
after
had
arrived
the
Burrow
and
Ron
went
down
breakfast
find
and
Mrs
Weasley
and
Ginny
already
sitting
the
kitchen
table
The
moment
she
saw
Harry
Ginny
accidentally
knocked
her
porridge
bowl
the
floor
with
loud
clatter
Ginny
seemed
very
prone
knocking
things
over
whenever
Harry
entered
room
She
dived
under
the
table
retrieve
the
bowl
and
emerged
with
her
face
glowing
like
the
setting
sun
Pretending
hadn
noticed
this
Harry
sat
down
and
took
the
toast
Mrs
Weasley
offered
him
Letters

Fred
and
George
ambled
still
their
pajamas
For
few
minutes
there
was
silence
they
all
read
their

Harry
told
him

said
The

this

Fred
caught
his
mother
eye
and
quickly
busied
himself
with
the
marmalade
That
lot
won
come
cheap
said
George
with
quick
look
his
parents
Lockhart

Mrs
Weasley
but
she
looked
worried
expect
able
pick

Ginny

starting
Hogwarts
this
year
Harry
asked
Ginny
She
nodded
blushing
the
roots
her
flaming
hair
and
put
her
elbow
the
butter
dish
Fortunately
one
saw
this
except
Harry
because
just
then
Ron
elder
brother
Percy
walked
was
already
dressed
his
Hogwarts
prefect
badge
pinned
his
sweater
vest
Morning
all
said
Percy
briskly
Lovely
day
sat
down
the
only
remaining
chair
but
leapt
again
almost
immediately
pulling
from
underneath
him
moulting
gray
feather
duster
least
that
was
what
Harry
thought
was
until
saw
that
was
breathing
Errol
said
Ron
taking
the
limp
owl
from
Percy
and
extracting
letter
from
under
its
wing
Finally
got
Hermione
answer
wrote
her
saying
were
going
try
and
rescue
you
from
the
Dursleys
carried
Errol
perch
just
inside
the
back
door
and
tried
stand
him
but
Errol
flopped
straight
off
again
Ron
lay
him
the
draining
board
instead
muttering
Pathetic
Then
ripped
open
Hermione
letter
and
read
out
loud
Dear
Ron
and
Harry
you
there
hope
everything
went
all
right
and
that
Harry
okay
and
that
you
didn
anything
illegal
get
him
out
Ron
because
that
would
get
Harry
into
trouble
too
been
really
worried
and
Harry
all
right
will
you
please
let
know
once
but
perhaps
would
bet
ter
you
used
different
owl
because
think
another
delivery
might
finish
your
one
off
very
busy
with
schoolwork
course
How

she
said
Ron

Well

said
Mrs
Weasley
starting
clear
the
table
What
you
all
today
Harry
Ron
Fred
and
George
were
planning
the
hill
small
paddock
the
Weasleys
owned
was
surrounded
trees
that
blocked
from
view
the
village
below
meaning
that
they
could
practice
Quidditch
there
long
they
didn
fly
too
high
They
couldn
use
real
Quidditch
balls
which
would
have
been
hard
explain
they
had
escaped
and
flown
away
over
the
village
instead
they
threw
apples
for
one
another
catch
They
took
turns
riding
Harry
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
which
was
easily
the
best
broom
Ron
old
Shooting
Star
was
often
outstripped
passing
butterflies
Five
minutes
later
they
were
marching
the
hill
broomsticks
over
their
shoulders
They
had
asked
Percy
wanted
join
them
but
had
said
was
busy
Harry
had
only
seen
Percy
mealtimes
far
stayed
shut
his
room
the
rest
the
time
Wish
knew
what
was
said
Fred
frowning
not
himself
His
exam
results
came
the
day
before
you
did
twelve
and
hardly
gloated
all
Ordinary

George
explained
seeing
Harry
puzzled
look
Bill
got

too
not
careful
have
another
Head
Boy
the
family
don
think
could
stand
the
shame
Bill
was
the
oldest
Weasley
brother
and
the
next
brother
Charlie
had
already
left
Hogwarts
Harry
had
never
met
either
them
but
knew
that
Charlie
was
Romania
studying
dragons
and
Bill
Egypt
working
for
the
wizard
bank
Gringotts
Dunno
how
Mum
and
Dad
are
going
afford
all
our
school
stuff
this
year
said
George
after
while
Five
sets
Lockhart
books
And
Ginny
needs
robes
and
wand
and
everything
Harry
said
nothing
felt
bit
awkward
Stored
underground
vault
Gringotts
London
was
small
fortune
that
his
parents
had
left
him
course
was
only
the
wizarding
world
that
had
money
you
couldn
use
Galleons
Sickles
and
Knuts
Muggle
shops
had
never
mentioned
his
Gringotts
bank
account
the
Dursleys
didn
think
their
horror
anything
connected
with
magic
would
stretch
large
pile
gold
Mrs
Weasley
woke
them
all
early
the
following
Wednesday
After
quick
half
dozen
bacon
sandwiches
each
they
pulled
their
coats
and
Mrs
Weasley
took
flowerpot
off
the
kitchen
mantelpiece
and
peered
inside
running
low
Arthur
she
sighed
have
buy
some
more
today
well
guests
first
After
you
Harry
dear
And
she
offered
him
the
flowerpot
Harry
stared
them
all
watching
him
what
supposed
stammered
never
traveled
Floo
powder
said
Ron
suddenly
Sorry
Harry
forgot
Never
said
Weasley
But
how
did

Diagon
Alley

school
things

year

Underground

Weasley
eagerly

Arthur
said
Mrs
Weasley

Mum
said
Fred
Harry
watch
first
took
pinch
glittering
powder
out
the
flowerpot
stepped
the
fire
and
threw
the
powder
into
the
flames
With
roar
the
fire
turned
emerald
green
and
rose
higher
than
Fred
who
stepped
right
into
shouted
Diagon
Alley
and
vanished
You
must
speak
clearly
dear
Mrs
Weasley
told
Harry
George
dipped
his
hand
into
the
flowerpot
And
sure
get
out
the
right
grate
The
right
what
said
Harry
nervously
the
fire
roared
and
whipped
George
out
sight
too
Well
there
are
awful
lot
wizard
fires
choose
from
you
know
but
long
you
spoken
clearly
fine
Molly
don
fuss
said
Weasley
helping
himself
Floo
powder
too
But
dear
got
lost
how
would
ever
explain
his
aunt
and
uncle
They
wouldn
mind
Harry
reassured
her
Dudley
would
think
was
brilliant
joke
got
lost
chimney
don
worry
about
that
Well
all
right
you
after
Arthur
said
Mrs
Weasley
Now
when
you
get
into
the
fire
say
where
you
going
And
keep
your
elbows
tucked
Ron
advised
And
your
eyes
shut
said
Mrs
Weasley
The
soot
Don
fidget
said
Ron
you
might
well
fall
out
the
wrong
fireplace
But
don
panic
and
get
out
too
early
wait
until
you
see
Fred
and
George
Trying
hard
bear
all
this
mind
Harry
took
pinch
Floo
powder
and
walked
the
edge
the
fire
took
deep
breath
scattered
the
powder
into
the
flames
and
stepped
forward
the
fire
felt
like
warm
breeze
opened
his
mouth
and
immediately
swallowed
lot
hot
ash
Dia
gon
Alley
coughed
felt
though
was
being
sucked
down
giant
drain
seemed
spinning
very
fast
the
roaring
his
ears
was
deafening
tried
keep
his
eyes
open
but
the
whirl
green
flames
made
him
feel
sick
something
hard
knocked
his
elbow
and
tucked
tightly
still
spinning
and
spinning
now
felt
though
cold
hands
were
slapping
his
face
squinting
through
his
glasses
saw
blurred
stream
fireplaces
and
snatched
glimpses
the
rooms
beyond
his
bacon
sandwiches
were
churning
inside
him
closed
his
eyes
again
wishing
would
stop
and
then
fell
face
forward
onto
cold
stone
and
felt
the
bridge
his
glasses
snap
Dizzy
and
bruised
covered
soot
got
gingerly
his
feet
holding
his
broken
glasses
his
eyes
was
cite
alone
but
where
was
had
idea
All
could
tell
was
that
was
standing
the
stone
fireplace
what
looked
like
large
dimly
lit
wizard
shop
but
nothing
here
was
ever
likely
Hogwarts
school
list
glass
case
nearby
held
withered
hand
cushion
bloodstained
pack
cards
and
staring

Evil
looking
masks
stared
down
from
the
walls
assortment
human
bones
lay
upon
the
counter
and
rusty
spiked
instruments
hung
from
the
ceiling
Even
worse
the
dark
narrow
street
Harry
could
see
through
the
dusty
shop
window
was
definitely
not
Diagon
Alley
The
sooner
got
out
here
the
better
Nose
still
stinging
where
had
hit
the
hearth
Harry
made
his
way
swiftly
and
silently
toward
the
door
but
before
got
halfway
toward
two
people
appeared
the
other
side
the
glass
and
one
them
was
the
very
last
person
Harry
wanted
meet
when
was
lost
covered
soot
and
wearing
broken
glasses
Draco
Malfoy
Harry
looked
quickly
around
and
spotted
large
black
cabinet
his
left
shot
inside
and
pulled
the
doors
closed
leaving
small
crack
peer
through
Seconds
later
bell
clanged
and
Malfoy
stepped
into
the
shop
The
man
who
followed
could
only
Draco
father
had
the
same
pale
pointed
face
and
identical
cold
gray
eyes
Malfoy
crossed
the
shop
looking
lazily
the
items
display
and
rang
bell
the
counter
before
turning
his
son
and
saying
Touch
nothing
Draco
Malfoy
who
had
reached
for
the
glass
eye
said
thought
you
were
going

his

drumming
his

What

Malfoy
looking
sulky
and
bad

You

said
Malfoy
with
quelling
look
his
son
And
would
remind
you
that
not
prudent
appear
less
than
fond
Harry
Potter
not
when
most
our
kind
regard
him
the
hero
who
made
the
Dark
Lord

Borgin
stooping
man
had
appeared
behind
the
counter
smoothing
his
greasy
hair
back
from
his
face
Malfoy
what
pleasure

said
Borgin
voice
oily
his

Delighted

Master
Malfoy

charmed
How

just

Borgin
but

Malfoy
Selling
The
smile
faded
slightly
from
Borgin
face
You
have
heard

Malfoy

The

said
Borgin
Let

interrupted
Draco
pointing

said
Borgin
abandoning
Malfoy
list
and
scurrying
over
Draco
Insert

Borgin
said
Malfoy
coldly
and
Borgin
said
quickly

Though

said
Malfoy
more
coldly
still
that

Draco
The

Malfoy
said
Harry

Draco

abashed
and
angry

all
over

Borgin

They
started

Harry
watched
nervously
Draco

nearer
and

stretched
out
his

for

Done

Malfoy

Come

Harry
wiped
his

Draco
turned
away
Good

The
moment
the

Borgin
dropped
his

manner
Good

Mister
Malfoy

the
stories

true
you

sold
half
what

Muttering
darkly
Borgin
disappeared
into

room
Harry
waited
for
minute

came
back
then
quietly
could
slipped
out

The

that
sped
along

through
the

Harry
enjoyed
the
breakneck
journey
down
the
Weasleys
vault
but
felt
dreadful
far
worse
than
had
Knockturn
Alley
when
was
opened
There
was
very
small
pile
silver
Sickles
inside
and
just
one
gold
Galleon
Mrs
Weasley
felt
right
into
the
corners
before
sweeping
the
whole
lot
into
her

Harry
felt
even
worse
when
they
reached
his
vault
tried
block
the
contents
from

hastily
shoved
handfuls
coins
into
leather
bag
Back

Mrs

The

his
pointed

short
irritable

man
was
dancing
around
taking

The

for

over
the

When

Lockhart
threw

Gilderoy

Staggering
slightly
under

weight
managed
make
his
way
out

and
Mrs

Arthur
said
Hagrid
almost
lifting

his
robes

The
assistant
looked
though
wanted
stop
them
leaving
but
barely
came
Hagrid
waist
and
seemed
think
better
They
hurried
the
street
the
Grangers
shaking
with
fright
and
Mrs
Weasley
beside
herself
with
fury
fine
example
set
for
your
children
brawling

the
fight
into

But
was
subdued
group
that
headed
back
the
fireside
the
Leaky
Cauldron
where
Harry
the
Weasleys
and
all
their
shopping
would
traveling
back
the
Burrow
using
Floo
powder
They
said
good
bye
the
Grangers
who
were
leaving
the
pub
for
the
Muggle
street
the
other
side
Weasley
started
ask
them
how
bus
stops
worked
but
stopped
quickly
the
look
Mrs
Weasley
face
Harry
took
off
his
glasses
and
put
them
safely
his
pocket
before
helping
himself
Floo

definitely
wasn
his
favorite
way
travel
THE
WHOMPING
WILLOW
end
the
summer
vacation
came
too
quickly
for
Harry
liking
was
looking
forward
getting
back
Hogwarts
but
his
month
the
Burrow
had
been
the
happiest
his
life
was
difficult
not
feel
jealous
Ron
when
thought
the
Dursleys
and
the
sort
welcome
could
expect
next
time
turned
Privet
Drive
their
last
evening
Mrs
Weasley
conjured
sumptuous
dinner
that
included
all
Harry
favorite
things
ending
with
mouthwatering
treacle
pudding
Fred
and
George
rounded
off
the
evening
with
display
Filibuster
fireworks
they
fiIled
the
kitchen
with
red
and
blue
stars
that
bounced
from
ceiling
wall
for
least
half
hour
Then
was
time
for
last
mug
hot
chocolate
and
bed
took
long
while
get
started
next
morning
They
were
dawn
but
somehow
they
still
seemed
have
great
deal
Mrs
Weasley
dashed
about
bad
mood
looking
for
spare
socks
and
quills
people
kept
colliding
the
stairs
half
dressed
with
bits
toast
their
hands
and
Weasley
nearly
broke
his
neck
tripping
over
stray
chicken
crossed
the
yard
carrying
Ginny
trunk
the
car
Harry
couldn
see
how
eight
people
six
large
trunks
two
owls
and
rat
were
going
fit
into
one
small
Ford
Anglia
had
reckoned
course
without
the
special
features
that
Weasley
had
added
Not
word
Molly
whispered
Harry
opened
the
trunk
and
showed
him
how
had
been
magically
expanded
that
the
luggage
fitted
easily
When
last
they
were
all
the
car
Mrs
Weasley
glanced
into
the
back
seat
where
Harry
Ron
Fred
George
and
Percy
were
all
sitting
comfortably
side
side
and
said
Muggles
know
more
than
give
them
credit
for
don
they
She
and
Ginny
got
into
the
front
seat
which
had
been
stretched
that
resembled
park
bench
mean
you
never
know
was
this
roomy
from
the
outside
would
you
Weasley
started
the
engine
and
they
trundled
out
the
yard
Harry
turning
back
for
last
look
the
house
barely
had
time
wonder
when
see
again
when
they
were
back
George
had
forgotten
his
box
Filibuster
fireworks
Five
minutes
after
that
they
skidded
halt
the
yard
that
Fred
could
run
for
his
broomstick
They
had
almost
reached
the
highway
when
Ginny
shrieked
that
she
left
her
diary
the
time
she
had
clambered
back
into
the
car
they
were
running
very
late
and
tempers
were
running
high
Weasley
glanced
his
watch
and
then
his
wife
Molly
dear
Arthur
one
would
see
this
little
button
here
Invisibility
Booster
installed
that
get
the
air
then
fly
above
the
clouds
there
ten
minutes
and
one
would
any
the
wiser
said
Arthur
not
broad
daylight
They
reached
King
Cross
quarter
eleven
Weasley
dashed
across
the
road
get
trolleys
for
their
trunks
and
they
all
hurried
into
the
station
Harry
had
caught
the
Hogwarts
Express
the
previous
year
The
tricky
part
was
getting
onto
platform
nine
and
three
quarters
which
wasn
visible
the
Muggle
eye
What
you
had
was
walk
through
the
solid
barrier
dividing
platforms
nine
and
ten
didn
hurt
but
had
done
carefully
that
none
the
Muggles
noticed
you
vanishing
Percy
first
said
Mrs
Weasley
looking
nervously
the
clock
overhead
which
showed
they
had
only
five
minutes
disappear
casually
through
the
barrier
Percy
strode
briskly
forward
and
vanished
Weasley
went
next
Fred
and
George
followed
take
Ginny
and
you
two
come
right
after
Mrs
Weasley
told
Harry
and
Ron
grabbing
Ginny
hand
and
setting
off
the
blink
eye
they
were
gone
Let
together
only
got
minute
Ron
said
Harry
Harry
made
sure
that
Hedwig
cage
was
safely
wedged
top
his
trunk
and
wheeled
his
trolley
around
face
the
barrier
felt
perfectly
confident
this
wasn
nearly
uncomfortable
using
Floo
powder
Both
them
bent
low
over
the
handles
their
trolleys
and
walked
purposefully
toward
the
barrier
gathering
speed
few
feet
away
from
they
broke
into
run
and
CRASH
Both
trolleys
hit
the
barrier
and
bounced
backward
Ron
trunk
fell
off
with
loud
thump
Harry
was
knocked
off
his
feet
and
Hedwig
cage
bounced
onto
the
shiny
floor
and
she
rolled
away
shrieking
indignantly
people
all
around
them
stared
and
guard
nearby
yelled
What
blazes
you
think
you
doing
Lost
control
the
trolley
Harry
gasped
clutching
his
ribs
got
Ron
ran
pick
Hedwig
who
was
causing
such
scene
that
there
was
lot
muttering
about
cruelty
animals
from
the
surrounding
crowd
Why
can
get
through
Harry
hissed
Ron
dunno
Ron
looked
wildly
around
dozen
curious
people
were
still
watching
them
going
miss
the
train
Ron
whispered
don
understand
why
the
gateway
sealed
itself
Harry
looked
the
giant
clock
with
sickening
feeling
the
pit
his
stomach
Ten
seconds
nine
seconds
wheeled
his
trolley
forward
cautiously
until
was
right
against
the
barrier
and
pushed
with
all
his
might
The
metal
remained
solid
Three
seconds
two
seconds
one
second
gone
said
Ron
sounding
stunned
The
train
left
What
Mum
and
Dad
can
get
back
through
Have
you
got
any
Muggle
money
And
they
marched
off
through
the
crowd
curious
Muggles
out
the
station
and
back
onto
the
side
road
where
the
old
Ford
Anglia
was
parked
Ron
unlocked
the
cavernous
trunk
with
series
taps
from
his
wand
They
heaved
their
luggage
back
put
Hedwig
the
back
seat
and
got
into
the
front
Check
that
one
watching
said
Ron
starting
the
ignition
with
another
tap
his
wand
Harry
stuck
his
head
out
the
window
Traffic
was
rumbling
along
the
main
road
ahead
but
their
street
was
empty
Okay
said
Ron
pressed
tiny
silver
button
the
dashboard
The
car
around
them
vanished
and
did
they
Harry
could
feel
the
seat
vibrating
beneath
him
hear
the
engine
feel
his
hands
his
knees
and
his
glasses
his
nose
but
for
all
could
see
had
become
pair
eyeballs
floating
few
feet
above
the
ground
dingy
street
full
parked
cars
Let
said
Ron
voice
from
his
right
And
the
ground
and
the
dirty
buildings
either
side
fell
away
dropping
out
sight
the
car
rose
seconds
the
whole
London
lay
smoky
and
glittering
below
them
Then
there
was
popping
noise
and
the
car
Harry
and
Ron
reappeared
said
Ron
jabbing
the
Invisibility
Booster
faulty
Both
them
pummeled
The
car
vanished
Then
flickered
back
again
Hold
Ron
yelled
and
slammed
his
foot
the
acceler
ator
they
shot
straight
into
the
low
woolly
clouds
and
everything
turned
dull
and
foggy
Now
what
said
Harry
blinking
the
solid
mass
cloud
pressing
them
from
all
sides
need
see
the
train
know
what
direction
said
Ron
Dip
back
down
again
quickly
They
dropped
back
beneath
the
clouds
and
twisted
around
their
seats
squinting
the
ground
can
see
Harry
yelled
Right
ahead
there
The
Hogwarts
Express
was
streaking
along
below
them
like
scarlet
snake
Due
north
said
Ron
checking
the
compass
the
dashboard
Okay
just
have
check
every
half
hour
hold
And
they
shot
through
the
clouds
minute
later
they
burst
out
into
blaze
sunlight
was
different
world
The
wheels
the
car
skimmed
the
sea
fluffy
cloud
the
sky
bright
endless
blue
under
the
blinding
white
sun
All
got
worry
about
now
are
airplanes
said
Ron
They
looked
each
other
and
started
laugh
for
long
time
they
couldn
stop
was
though
they
had
been
plunged
into
fabulous
dream
This
thought
Harry
was
surely
the
only
way
travel
past
swirls
and
turrets
snowy
cloud
car
full
hot
bright
sunlight
with
fat
pack
toffees
the
glove
compartment
and
the
prospect
seeing
Fred
and
George
jealous
faces
when
they
landed
smoothly
and
spectacularly
the
sweeping
lawn
front
Hogwarts
castle
They
made
regular
checks
the
train
they
flew
farther
and
farther
north
each
dip
beneath
the
clouds
showing
them
different
view
London
was
soon
far
behind
them
replaced
neat
green
fields
that
gave
way
turn
wide
purplish
moors
great
city
alive
with
cars
like
multicolored
ants
villages
with
tiny
toy
churches
Several
uneventful
hours
later
however
Harry
had
admit
that
some
the
fun
was
wearing
off
The
toffees
had
made
them
extremely
thirsty
and
they
had
nothing
drink
and
Ron
had
pulled
off
their
sweaters
but
Harry
shirt
was
sticking
the
back
his
seat
and
his
glasses
kept
sliding
down
the
end
his
sweaty
nose
had
stopped
noticing
the
fantastic
cloud
shapes
now
and
was
thinking
longingly
the
train
miles
below
where
you
could
buy
ice
cold
pumpkin
juice
from
trolley
pushed
plump
witch
Why
hadn
they
been
able
get
onto
platform
nine
and
three
quarters
Can
much
further
can
croaked
Ron
hours
later
still
the
sun
started
sink
into
their
floor
cloud
staining
deep
pink
Ready
for
another
check
the
train
was
still
right
below
them
winding
its
way
past
snowcapped
mountain
was
much
darker
beneath
the
canopy
clouds
Ron
put
his
foot
the
accelerator
and
drove
them
upward
again
but
did
the
engine
began
whine
Harry
and
Ron
exchanged
nervous
glances
probably
just
tired
said
Ron
never
been
this
far
before
And
they
both
pretended
not
notice
the
whining
growing
louder
and
louder
the
sky
became
steadily
darker
Stars
were
blossoming
the
blackness
Harry
pulled
his
sweater
back
try
ing
ignore
the
way
the
windshield
wipers
were
now
waving
fee
bly
though
protest
Not
far
said
Ron
more
the
car
than
Harry
not
far
now
and
patted
the
dashboard
nervously
When
they
flew
back
beneath
the
clouds
little
while
later
they
had
squint
through
the
darkness
for
landmark
they
knew
There
Harry
shouted
making
Ron
and
Hedwig
jump
Straight
ahead
Silhouetted
the
dark
horizon
high
the
cliff
over
the
lake
stood
the
many
turrets
and
towers
Hogwarts
castle
But
the
car
had
begun
shudder
and
was
losing
speed
Come
Ron
said
cajolingly
giving
the
steering
wheel
lit
tle
shake
nearly
there
come
The
engine
groaned
Narrow
jets
steam
were
issuing
from
der
the
hood
Harry
found
himself
gripping
the
edges
his
seat
very
hard
they
flew
toward
the
lake
The
car
gave
nasty
wobble
Glancing
out
his
window
Harry
saw
the
smooth
black
glassy
surface
the
water
mile
below
Ron
knuckles
were
white
the
steering
wheel
The
car
wobbled
again
Come
Ron
muttered
They
were
over
the
lake
the
castle
was
right
ahead
Ron
put
his
foot
down
There
was
loud
clunk
splutter
and
the
engine
died
com
pletely
said
Ron
into
the
silence
The
nose
the
car
dropped
They
were
falling
gathering
speed
heading
straight
for
the
solid
castle
wall
Noooooo
Ron
yelled
swinging
the
steering
wheel
around
they
missed
the
dark
stone
wall
inches
the
car
turned
great
arc
soaring
over
the
dark
greenhouses
then
the
vegetable
patch
and
then
out
over
the
black
lawns
losing
altitude
all
the
time
Ron
let
the
steering
wheel
completely
and
pulled
his
wand
out
his
back
pocket
STOP
STOP
yelled
whacking
the
dashboard
and
the
windshield
but
they
were
still
plummeting
the
ground
flying
toward
them
WATCH
OUT
FOR
THAT
TREE
Harry
bellowed
lunging
for
the
steering
wheel
but
too
late
CRUNCH
With
earsplitting
bang
metal
wood
they
hit
the
thick
tree
trunk
and
dropped
the
ground
with
heavy
jolt
Steam
was
billowing
from
under
the
crumpled
hood
Hedwig
was
shrieking
terror
golfball
size
lump
was
throbbing
Harry
head
where
had
hit
the
windshield
and
his
right
Ron
let
out
low
despairing
groan
Are
you
okay
Harry
said
urgently
wand
said
Ron
shaky
voice
Look
wand
had
snapped
almost
two
the
tip
was
dangling
limply
held
few
splinters
Harry
opened
his
mouth
say
was
sure
they
able
mend
the
school
but
never
even
got
started
that
very
moment
something
hit
his
side
the
car
with
the
force
charging
bull
sending
him
lurching
sideways
into
Ron
just
equally
heavy
blow
hit
the
roof
What
happen
Ron
gasped
staring
through
the
windshield
and
Harry
looked
around
just
time
see
branch
thick
python
smash
into
The
tree
they
had
hit
was
attacking
them
Its
trunk
was
bent
almost
double
and
its
gnarled
boughs
were
pummeling
every
inch
the
car
could
reach
Aaargh
said
Ron
another
twisted
limb
punched
large
dent
into
his
door
the
windshield
was
now
trembling
under
hail
blows
from
knuckle
like
twigs
and
branch
thick
battering
ram
was
pounding
furiously
the
roof
which
seemed
caving
Run
for
Ron
shouted
throwing
his
full
weight
against
his
door
but
next
second
had
been
knocked
backward
into
Harry
lap
vicious
uppercut
from
another
branch
done
for
moaned
the
ceiling
sagged
but
suddenly
the
floor
the
car
was
vibrating
the
engine
had
restarted
Reverse
Harry
yelled
and
the
car
shot
backward
the
tree
was
still
trying
hit
them
they
could
hear
its
roots
creaking
almost
ripped
itself
lashing
out
them
they
sped
out
reach
That
panted
Ron
was
close
Well
done
car
The
car
however
had
reached
the
end
its
tether
With
two
sharp
clunks
the
doors
flew
open
and
Harry
felt
his
seat
tip
sideways
Next
thing
knew
was
sprawled
the
damp
ground
Loud
thuds
told
him
that
the
car
was
ejecting
their
luggage
from
the
trunk
Hedwig
cage
flew
through
the
air
and
burst
open
she
rose
out
with
angry
screech
and
sped
off
toward
the
castle
without
backward
look
Then
dented
scratched
and
steaming
the
car
rumbled
off
into
the
darkness
its
rear
lights
blazing
angrily
Come
back
Ron
yelled
after
brandishing
his
broken
wand
Dad
kill
But
the
car
disappeared
from
view
with
one
last
snort
from
its
exhaust
Can
you
believe
our
luck
said
Ron
miserably
bending
down
pick
Scabbers
all
the
trees
could
hit
had
get
one
that
hits
back
glanced
over
his
shoulder
the
ancient
tree
which
was
still
flailing
its
branches
threateningly
Come
said
Harry
wearily
better
get
the
school
wasn
all
the
triumphant
arrival
they
had
pictured
Stiff
cold
and
bruised
they
seized
the
ends
their
trunks
and
began
dragging
them
the
grassy
slope
toward
the
great
oak
front
doors
think
the
feast
already
started
said
Ron
dropping
his
trunk
the
foot
the
front
steps
and
crossing
quietly
look
through
brightly
lit
window
Hey
Harry
come
and
look
the
Sorting
Harry
hurried
over
and
together
and
Ron
peered
the
Great
Hall
Innumerable
candles
were
hovering
midair
over
four
long
crowded
tables
making
the
golden
plates
and
goblets
sparkle
Overhead
the
bewitched
ceiling
which
always
mirrored
the
sky
outside
sparkled
with
stars
Through
the
forest
pointed
black
Hogwarts
hats
Harry
saw
long
line
scared
looking
first
years
fiIing
into
the
Hall
Ginny
was
among
them
easily
visible
because
her
vivid
Weasley
Meanwhile
Professor
McGonagall
bespectacled
witch
with
her
hair
tight
bun
was
placing
the
famous
Hogwarts
Sorting
Hat
stool
before
the
newcomers
Every
year
this
aged
old
hat
patched
frayed
and
dirty
sorted
new
students
into
the
four
Hogwarts
houses
Gryffindor
Hufflepuff
Ravenclaw
and
Slytherin
Harry
well
remembered
putting
exactly
one
year
ago
and
waiting
petrified
for
its
decision
muttered
aloud
his
ear
For
few
horrible
seconds
had
feared
that
the
hat
was
going
put
him
Slytherin
the
house
that
had
turned
out
more
Dark
witches
and
wizards
than
any
other
but
had
ended
Gryffindor
along
with
Ron
Hermione
and
the
rest
the
Weasleys
Last
term
Harry
and
Ron
had
helped
Gryffindor
win
the
House
Championship
beating
Slytherin
for
the
first
time
seven
years
very
small
mousy
haired
boy
had
been
called
forward
place
the
hat
his
head
Harry
eyes
wandered
past
him
where
Professor
Dumbledore
the
headmaster
sat
watching
the
Sorting
from
the
staff
table
his
long
silver
beard
and
half
moon
glasses
shining
brightly
the
candlelight
Several
seats
along
Harry
saw
Gilderoy
Lockhart
dressed
robes
aquamarine
And
there
the
end
was
Hagrid
huge
and
hairy
drinking
deeply
from
his
goblet
Hang
Harry
muttered
Ron
There
empty
chair
the
staff
table
Where
Snape
Professor
Severus
Snape
was
Harry
least
favorite
teacher
Harry
also
happened
Snape
least
favorite
student
Cruel
sarcastic
and
disliked
everybody
except
the
students
from
his
own
house
Slytherin
Snape
taught
Potions
Maybe
ill
said
Ron
hopefully
Maybe
left
said
rry
because
missed
out
the
Defense
Against
Dark
Arts
job
again
might
have
been
sacked
said
Ron
enthusiastically
mean
everyone
hates
him
maybe
said
very
cold
voice
right
behind
them
waiting
hear
why
you
two
didn
arrive
the
school
train
Harry
spun
around
There
his
black
robes
rippling
cold
breeze
stood
Severus
Snape
was
thin
man
with
sallow
skin
hooked
nose
and
greasy
shoulder
length
black
hair
and
this
moment
was
smiling
way
that
told
Harry
and
Ron
were
very
deep
trouble
Follow
said
Snape
Not
daring
even
look
each
other
Harry
and
Ron
followed
Snape
the
steps
into
the
vast
echoing
entrance
hall
which
was
lit
with
flaming
torches
delicious
smell
food
was
wafting
from
the
Great
Hall
but
Snape
led
them
away
from
the
warmth
and
light
down
narrow
stone
staircase
that
led
into
the
dungeons
said
opening
door
halfway
down
the
cold
passageway
and
pointing
They
entered
Snape
office
shivering
The
shadowy
walls
were
lined
with
shelves
large
glass
ars
which
floated
all
manner
revolting
things
Harry
didn
really
want
know
the
name
the
moment
The
fireplace
was
dark
and
empty
Snape
closed
the
door
and
turned
look
them
said
softly
the
train
isn
good
enough
for
the
famous
Harry
Potter
and
his
faithful
sidekick
Weasley
Wanted
arrive
with
bang
did
boys
sir
was
the
barrier
King
Cross
Silence
said
Snape
coldly
What
have
you
done
with
the
car
Ron
gulped
This
wasn
the
first
time
Snape
had
given
Harry
the
impression
being
able
read
minds
But
moment
later
derstood
Snape
unrolled

said
looking
Ron
and
smiling
still
more
nastily
Dear
dear
his
own
son
Harry
felt
though
just
been
walloped
the
stomach
one
the
mad
tree
larger
branches
anyone
found
out
Weasley
had
bewitched
the
car
hadn
thought
that

Whomping

Snape

That
tree

Ron
blurted
out
Silence
snapped
Snape
again
Most
unfortunately

not

the
people

You

Harry
and
Ron
stared
each
other
white
faced
Harry
didn
feel
hungry
any
more
now
felt
extremely
sick
tried
not
look
large
slimy
something
suspended
green
liquid
shelf
behind
Snape
desk
Snape
had
gone
fetch
Professor
McGonagall
head
Gryffindor
House
they
were
hardly
any
better
off
She
might
fairer
than
Snape
but
she
was
still
extremely
strict
Ten
minutes
later
Snape
returned
and
sure
enough
was
Professor
McGonagall
who
accompanied
him
Harry
had
seen
Professor
McGonagall
angry
several
occasions
but
either
had
forgotten
just
how
thin
her
mouth
could
had
never
seen
her
this
angry
before
She
raised
her
wand
the
moment
she
entered
Harry
and
Ron
both
flinched
but
she
merely
pointed
the
empty
fireplace
where
flames
suddenly
erupted
Sit
she
said
and
they
both
backed
into
chairs
the
fire
Explain
she
said
her
glasses
glinting
ominously
Ron
launched
into
the
story
starting

Professor

Why
didn
you
send

owl
believe

Professor
McGonagall
said
coldly
Harry
Harry
gaped
her
Now
she
said
that
seemed
the
obvious
thing
have
done
didn
think
That
said
Professor
McGonagall
obvious
There
was
knock
the
office
door
and
Snape
now
looking
happier
than
ever
opened
There
stood
the
headmaster
Professor
Dumbledore
Harry
whole
body
went
numb
Dumbledore
was
looking
unusually
grave
stared
down
his
very
crooked
nose
them
and
Harry
suddenly
found
himself
wishing
and
Ron
were
still
being
beaten
the
Whomping
Willow
There
was
long
silence
Then
Dumbledore
said
Please
explain
why
you
did
this
would
have
been
better
had
shouted
Harry
hated
the
disappointment
his
voice
For
some
reason
was
unable
look
Dumbledore
the
eyes
and
spoke
instead
his
knees
told
Dumbledore
everything
except
that
Weasley
owned
the
bewitched
car
making
sound
though
and
Ron
had
happened
find
flying
car
parked
outside
the
station
knew
Dumbledore
would
see
through
this
once
but
Dumbledore
asked
questions
about
the
car
When
Harry
had
finished
merely
continued
peer
them
through
his
spectacles
and
get
our
stuff
said
Ron
hopeless
sort
voice
What
are
you
talking
about
Weasley
barked
Professor
McGonagall
Well

expelling
aren
you
said
Ron
Harry
looked
quickly
Dumbledore
Not

Weasley
said
Dumbledore
But

impress
upon
both
you
the
seriousness
what
you
have
done
will
writing
both
your
families
tonight
must
also
warn
you
that
you
anything
like
this
again
will
have
choice
but
expel
you
Snape
looked
though
Christmas
had
been
canceled
cleared
his
throat
and
said
Professor
Dumbledore
these
boys
have
flouted
the
Decree
for
the
Restriction
Underage
Wizardry
caused
serious
damage
old
and
valuable
tree
surely
acts
this
nature
will
for
Professor
McGonagall
decide
these
boys
punishments
Severus
said
Dumbledore
calmly
They
are
her
House
and
are
therefore
her
responsibility
turned
Professor
McGonagall
must

feast
Minerva

notices
Come

Snape
shot
look
pure
venom
Harry
and
Ron
allowed
himself
swept
out
his
office
leaving
them
alone
with
Pro
fessor
McGonagall
who
was
still
eyeing
them
like
wrathful
eagle
You
better
get
along
the
hospital
wing
Weasley
you
bleeding
Not
much
said
Ron
hastily
wiping
the
cut
over
his
eye
with
his
sleeve
Professor
wanted
watch
sister
being
Sorted
The
Sorting
Ceremony
over
said
Professor
McGonagall
Your
sister

Gryffindor

said
Ron
And
speaking
Gryffindor
Professor
McGonagall
said
sharply
but
Harry
cut
Professor
when
took
the
car
term
hadn
started
Gryffindor
shouldn
really
have
points
taken
from
should
finished
watching
her
anxiously
Professor
McGonagall
gave
him
piercing
look
but
was
sure
she
had
almost
smiled
Her
mouth
looked
less
thin
anyway
will
not
take
any
points
from
Gryffindor
she
said
and
Harry
heart
lightened
considerably
But
you
will
both
get
tention
was
better
than
Harry
had
expected
for
Dumbledore
writing
the
Dursleys
that
was
nothing
Harry
knew
perfectly
well
they
just
disappointed
that
the
Whomping
Willow
hadn
squashed
him
flat
Professor
McGonagall
raised
her
wand
again
and
pointed
Snape
desk
large
plate
sandwiches
two
silver
goblets
and
jug
iced
pumpkin
juice
appeared
with
pop
You
will
eat
here
and
then
straight
your
dormitory
she
said
must
also
return
the
feast
When
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
Ron
let
out
long
low
whistle
thought
had
said
grabbing
sandwich
did
said
Harry
taking
one
too
Can
you
believe
our
luck
though
said
Ron
thickly
through
mouthful
chicken
and
ham
Fred
and
George
must
flown
that
car
five
six
times
and
Muggle
ever
saw
them
swallowed
and
took
another
huge
bite
Why
couldn
get
through
the
barrier
Harry
shrugged
have
watch
our
step
from
now
though
said
taking
grateful
swig
pumpkin
juice
Wish
could
gone
the
feast
She
didn
want
showing
off
said
Ron
sagely
Doesn
want
people
think
clever
arriving
flying
car
When
they
had
eaten
many
sandwiches
they
could
the
plate
kept
refilling
itself
they
rose
and
left
the
office
treading
the
familiar
path
Gryffindor
Tower
The
castle
was
quiet
seemed
that
the
feast
was
over
They
walked
past
muttering
portraits
and
creaking
suits
armor
and
climbed
narrow
flights
stone
stairs
until
last
they
reached
the
passage
where
the
secret
entrance
Gryffindor
Tower
was
hidden
behind
oil
painting
very
fat
woman
pink
silk
dress
Password
she
said
they
approached
said
Harry
They
didn
know
the
new
year
password
not
having
met
Gryffindor
prefect
yet
but
help
came
almost
immediately
they
heard
hurrying
feet
behind
them
and
turned
see
Hermione
dashing
toward
them
There
you
are
Where
have
you
been
The
most
ridiculous
rumors
someone
said
you
been
expelled
for
crashing
flying
car
Well
haven
been
expelled
Harry
assured
her
You
not
telling
you
did
fly
here
said
Hermione
sounding
almost
severe
Professor
McGonagall
Skip
the
lecture
said
Ron
impatiently
and
tell
the
new
password
wattlebird
said
Hermione
impatiently
but
that
not
the
point
Her
words
were
cut
short
however
the
portrait
the
fat
lady
swung
open
and
there
was
sudden
storm
clapping
looked
though
the
whole
Gryffindor
House
was
still
awake
packed
into
the
circular
common
room
standing
the
lopsided
tables
and
squashy
armchairs
waiting
for
them

Arms
reached
through

talking
about

years
Good

said
fifth

Harry
had
never
spoken
someone
was
patting
him
the
back
though
just
won
marathon
Fred
and
George
pushed
their
way
the
front
the
crowd
and
said
together
Why
couldn
come
the
car
Ron
was
scarlet
the
face
grinning
embarrassedly
but
Harry
could
see
one
person
who
didn
look
happy
all
Percy
was
visible
over
the
heads
some
excited
first
years
and
seemed
trying
get
near
enough
start
telling
them
off
Harry
nudged
Ron
the
ribs
and
nodded
Percy
direction
Ron
got
the
point
once
Got
get
upstairs
bit
tired
said
and
the
two
them
started
pushing
their
way
toward
the
door
the
other
side
the
room
which
led
spiral
staircase
and
the
dormitories
Night
Harry
called
back
Hermione
who
was
wearing
scowl
just
like
Percy
They
managed
get
the
other
side
the
common
room
still
having
their
backs
slapped
and
gained
the
peace
the
staircase
They
hurried
right
the
top
and
last
reached
the
door
their
old
dormitory
which
now
had
sign
saying
SECOND
YEARS
They
entered
the
familiar
circular
room
with
its
five
four
posters
hung
with
red
velvet
and
its
high
narrow
windows
Their
trunks
had
been
brought
for
them
and
stood
the
ends
their
beds
Ron
grinned
guiltily
Harry
know
shouldn
enjoyed
that
anything
but
The
dormitory
door
flew
open
and
came
the

GILDEROY

next
day
however
Harry
barely
grinned
once
Things
started
downhill
from
breakfast
the
Great
Hall
The
four
long
house
tables
were
laden
with
tureens
porridge
plates
kippers
mountains
toast
and
dishes
eggs
and
bacon
beneath
the
enchanted
ceiling
today
dull
cloudy
gray
Harry
and
Ron
sat
down
the
Gryffindor
table
next
Hermione
who
had
her
copy
Voyages
with
Vampires
propped
open
against
milk
jug
There
was
slight
stiffness
the
way
she
said
Morning
which
told
Harry
that
she
was
still
disapproving
the
way
they
had
arrived
Neville
Longbottom
the
other
hand
greeted
them
cheerfully
Neville
was
round
faced
and
accident
prone
boy
with
the
worst
memory
anyone
Harry
had
ever
met
Mail
due
any
minute
think
Gran
sending
few
things
forgot
Harry
had
only
just
started
his
porridge
when
sure
enough
there
was
rushing
sound
overhead
and
hundred
owls
streamed
circling
the
hall
and
dropping
letters
and
packages
into
the
chattering
crowd
big
lumpy
package
bounced
off
Neville
head
and
second
later
something
large
and
gray
fell
into
Hermione
jug
spraying
them
all
with
milk
and
feathers
Enrol
said
Ron
pulling
the
bedraggled
owl
out
the
feet
Errol
slumped
unconscious
onto
the
table
his
legs
the
air
and
damp
red
envelope
his
beak
Ron
gasped
all
right
still
alive
said
Hermione
prodding
Errol
gently
with
the
tip
her
finger
not
that
that
Ron
was
pointing
the
red
envelope
looked
quite
ordinary
Harry
but
Ron
and
Neville
were
both
looking
though
they
expected
explode
What
the
matter
said
Harry
She
she

Ron
faintly
You

Ron
said
Neville
timid
whisper

sent
one
once
and
ignored
and
gulped
was
horrible
Harry
looked
from
their
petrified
faces
the
red
envelope
What
Howler
said
But
Ron
whole
attention
was
fixed
the
letter
which
had
begun
smoke
the
corners
Open
Neville
urged
all
over
few
minutes
Ron
stretched
out
shaking
hand
eased
the
envelope
from
Errol
beak
and
slit
open
Neville
stuffed
his
fingers
his
ears
split
second
later
Harry
knew
why
thought
for
moment
had
exploded
roar

fiIled
the
huge

Mrs

yells
hundred
times
louder
than
usual
made
the
plates
and
spoons
rattle
the
table
and
echoed
deafeningly
off
the
stone
walls
People
throughout
the
hall
were
swiveling
around
see
who
had
received
the
Howler
and
Ron
sank
low
his
chair
that
only
his
crimson
forehead
could
seen

had
been

when

tried
very
hard
look
though
couldn
hear
the
voice
that
was
making
his

ringing
silence
fell
The
red
envelope
which
had
dropped
from
Ron
hand
burst
into
flames
and
curled
into
ashes
Harry
and
Ron
sat
stunned
though
tidal
wave
had
just
passed
over
them
few
people
laughed
and
gradually
babble
talk
broke
out
again
Hermione
closed
Voyages
with
Vampires
and
looked
down
the
top
Ron
head
Well
don
know
what
you
expected
Ron
but
you
Don
tell

snapped
Ron
Harry
pushed
his
porridge
away
His
insides
were
burning
with
guilt
Weasley
was
facing
inquiry
work
After
all
and
Mrs
Weasley
had
done
for
him
over
the
summer
But
had
time
dwell
this
Professor
McGonagall
was
moving
along
the
Gryffindor
table
handing
out
course
schedules
Harry
took
his
and
saw
that
they
had
double
Herbology
with
the
Hufepuffs
first
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
left
the
castle
together
crossed
the
vegetable
patch
and
made
for
the
greenhouses
where
the
magical
plants
were
kept
least
the
Howler
had
done
one
good
thing
Hermione
seemed
think
they
had
now
been
punished
enough
and
was
being
perfectly
friendly
again
they
neared
the
greenhouses
they
saw
the
rest
the
class
standing
outside
waiting
for
Professor
Sprout
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
only
just
joined
them
when
she
came
striding
into
view
across
the
lawn
accompanied
Gilderoy
Lockhart
Professor
Sprout
arms
were
full
bandages
and
with
another
twinge
guilt
Harry
spotted
the
Whomping
Willow
the
distance
several
its
branches
now
slings
Professor
Sprout
was
squat
little
witch
who
wore
patched
hat
over
her
flyaway
hair
there
was
usually
large
amount
earth
her
clothes
and
her
fingernails
would
have
made
Aunt
Petunia
faint
Gilderoy
Lockhart
however
was
immaculate
sweeping

his
golden
hair
shining
under
perfectly

Professor

There

Professor
Sprout
took
large
key
from
her
belt
and
unlocked
the
door
Harry
caught
whiff
damp
earth
and
fertilizer
mingling
with
the
heavy
perfume
some
giant
umbrella
sized
flowers
dangling
from
the
ceiling
was
about
follow
Ron
and
Hermione
inside
when
Lockhart

shot
out

Lockhart

closed
the

Harry
said
Lockhart
his
large

his
head
Harry

Completely

and
strode

Harry
stood
stunned
for
few
seconds
then
remembering

supposed
the
greenhouse
opened
the
door
and
slid
inside
Professor
Sprout
was
standing
behind
trestle
bench
the
cen
ter
the
greenhouse
About
twenty
pairs
different
colored

muffs
were
lying
the
bench
When
Harry
had
taken
his
place
between
Ron
and
Hermione
she

She

everyone
shuffled
forward
for

They
looked
quite
unremarkable
Harry
who
didn

the

what
Hermione
meant
the
cry
the
Mandrake
Everyone

Professor

There

Harry
snapped
the
earmuffs
over
his
ears
They
shut
out

completely
Professor
Sprout
put
the
pink
fluffy
pair
over
her
own
ears
rolled
the
sleeves
her
robes
grasped
one
the
tufty
plants
firmly
and
pulled

Harry
let

that

Instead

The

growing
right
out
his
head
had
pale
green
mottled
skin
and
was
clearly
bawling
the
top
his
lungs
Professor
Sprout
took
large
plant
pot
from
under
the
table
and
plunged
the
Mandrake
into
burying
him
dark
damp
compost
until
only
the
tufted
leaves
were
visible
Professor
Sprout
dusted
off
her
hands
gave
them
all
the
thumbs
and
removed
her
own
earmuffs
our
Mandrakes
are
only
seedlings
their
cries
won
kill
yet
she
said
calmly
though
she
just
done
nothing
more
exciting
than
water
begonia
However
they
will
knock
you
out
for
several
hours
and
sure
none
you
want
miss
your
first
day
back
make
sure
your
earmuffs
are
securely
place
while
you
work
will
attract
your
attention
when

Four

large
supply

sacks

and
careful
the
Venemous
Tentacula
teething
She
gave
sharp
slap
spiky
dark
red
plant
she
spoke
making
draw
the
long
feelers
that
had
been
inching
sneakily
over
her
shoulder
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
joined
their
tray
curly
haired
Hufflepuff
boy
Harry
knew
sight
but
had
never
spoken
Justin
Finch
Fletchley
said
brightly
shaking
Harry
the
hand
Know
who
you
are
course
the
famous
Harry
Potter
And
you
Hermione
Granger
always
top
everything
Hermione
beamed
she
had
her
hand
shaken
too
and
Ron
Weasley
Wasn
that
your
flying
car
Ron
didn
smile
The
Howler
was
obviously
still
his
mind
That
Lockhart
something
isn
said
Justin
happily
they
began
fiIling
their
plant
pots
with
dragon
dung
compost
Awfully
brave
chap
Have
you
read
his
books
have
died
fear
been
cornered
telephone
booth
werewolf
but
stayed
cool
and
zap
just
fantastic
name
was
down
for
Eton
you
know
can
tell
you
how
glad
came
here
instead
course
Mother
was
slightly
disappointed
but
since
made
her
read
Lockhart
books
think
she
begun
see
how
useful
have
fully
trained
wizard
the
family
After
that
they
didn
have
much
chance
talk
Their
earmuffs
were
back
and
they
needed
concentrate
the
Mandrakes
Professor
Sprout
had
made
look
extremely
easy
but
wasn
The
Mandrakes
didn
like
coming
out
the
earth
but
didn
seem
want
back
into
either
They
squirmed
kicked
flailed
their
sharp
little
fists
and
gnashed
their
teeth
Harry
spent
ten
whole
minutes
trying
squash
particularly
fat
one
into
pot
the
end
the
class
Harry
like
everyone
else
was
sweaty
aching
and
covered
earth
Everyone
traipsed
back
the
castle
for
quick
wash
and
then
the
Gryffindors
hurried
off
Transfiguration
Professor
McGonagall
classes
were
always
hard
work
but
today
was
especially
difficult
Everything
Harry
had
learned
last
year
seemed
have
leaked
out
his
head
during
the
summer
was
supposed
turning
beetle
into
button
but
all
managed
was
give
his
beetle
lot
exercise
scuttled
over
the
desktop
avoiding
his
wand
Ron
was
having
far
worse
problems
had
patched
his
wand
with
some
borrowed
Spellotape
but
seemed
damaged
beyond
repair
kept
crackling
and
sparking
odd
moments
and
every
time
Ron
tried
transfigure
his
beetle
engulfed
him
thick
gray
smoke
that
smelled
rotten
eggs
Unable
see
what
was
doing
Ron
accidentally
squashed
his
beetle
with
his
elbow
and
had
ask
for
new
one
Professor
McGonagall
wasn
pleased
Harry
was
relieved
hear
the
lunch
bell
His
brain
felt
like
wrung
sponge
Everyone
fiIed
out
the
classroom
except
him
and
Ron
who
was
whacking
his
wand
furiously
the
desk
Stupid
useless
thing
Write
home
for
another
one
Harry
suggested
the
wand
let
off
volley
bangs
like
firecracker
yeah
and
get
another
Howler
back
said
Ron
stuffing
the
now
hissing
wand
into
his
bag
your
own
fault
your
wand
got
snapped
They
went
down
lunch
where
Ron
mood
was
not
improved
Hermione
showing
them
the
handful
perfect
coat
buttons
she
had
produced
Transfiguration
What
got
this
afternoon
said
Harry
hastily
changing
the
subject
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
said
Hermione
once
Why
demanded
Ron
seizing
her
schedule
have
you
outlined
all
Lockhart
lessons
little
hearts
Hermione
snatched
the
schedule
back
blushing
furiously
They
finished
lunch
and
went
outside
into
the
overcast
courtyard
Hermione
sat
down
stone
step
and
buried
her
nose
Voyages
with
Vampires
again
Harry
and
Ron
stood
talking
about
Quidditch
for
several
minutes
before
Harry
became
aware
that
was
being
closely
watched
Looking
saw
the
very
small
mousy
haired
boy
seen
trying
the
Sorting
Hat
last
night
staring
Harry
though
transfixed
was
clutching
what
looked
like
ordinary
Muggle
camera
and
the
moment
Harry
looked
him
went
bright
red
All

Harry
Colin
Creevey
said
breathlessly
taking

Ron
angrily
Crabbe

and
started
rubbing

sneered

Ron

Spellotaped

but
Hermione
shut

Vampires
with
snap
and
whispered
Look

What

Gilderoy
Lockhart
was
striding
toward
them
his
turquoise
robes
swirling
behind
him
Who

Harry
started
speak
but
was
cut
short
Lockhart
flung
arm
around
his
shoulders
and
thundered
jovially
Shouldn
have
asked

again
Harry
Pinned
Lockhart
side
and
burning
with
humiliation
Harry
saw
Malfoy
slide
smirking
back
into
the
crowd
Come

Creevey
said
Lockhart
beaming
Colin

Colin
fumbled
for
his
camera
and
took
the
picture
the
bell
rang
behind
them
signaling
the
start
afternoon
classes
Off

Lockhart
called
the
crowd
and
set
off
back
the
castle
with
Harry
who
was
wishing

Vanishing

Lockhart
swept
him
down
corridor
lined
with
staring
students
and
staircase
Let

Harry

There

gave
little
chor
tle
don
think
you
quite
there
yet
They
had
reached
Lockhart
classroom
and
let
Harry
last
Harry
yanked
his
robes
straight
and
headed
for
seat
the
very
back
the
class
where
busied
himself
with
piling
all
seven
Lockhart
books
front
him
that
could
avoid
looking
the
real
thing
The
rest
the
class
came
clattering
and
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
down
either
side
Harry
You

Ron

Harry
The
last
thing
needed
was
for
Lockhart

phrase

When
the
whole
class
was
seated
Lockhart
cleared
his
throat
loudly
and
silence
fell

picked
Neville

When
had
handed
out
the
test
papers
returned
the
front
the
class
and
said
You

minutes

Harry
looked

read

Half

Tut

large

Ogdeds

Ron
was
now
staring
Lockhart
with
expression
disbelief
his
face
Seamus
Finnigan
and
Dean
Thomas
who
were
sitting
front
were
shaking
with
silent
laughter
Hermione
the
other
hand
was
listening
Lockhart
with
rapt
attention
and
gave
start
when
mentioned
her
name

Miss

Hermione

Excellent

Lockhart
Quite

Take

points
for
Gryffindor
And
business
bent
down
behind
his
desk
and
lifted
large
covered
cage
onto
Now
warned
job
arm
you
against
the
foulest
creatures
known
wizardkind
You
may
find
yourselves
facing
your
worst
fears
this
room
Know
only
that
harm
can
befall
you
whilst
here
All
ask
that
you
remain
calm
spite
himself
Harry
leaned
around
his
pile
books
for
better
look
the
cage
Lockhart
placed
hand
the
cover
Dean
and
Seamus
had
stopped
laughing
now
Neville
was
cowering
his
front
row
seat
must
ask
you
not
scream
said
Lockhart
low
voice
might
provoke
them
the
whole
class
held
its
breath
Lockhart
whipped
off
the
cover
Yes
said
dramatically
Freshly
caught
Cornish
pixies
Seamus
Finnigan
couldn
control
himself
let
out
snort
laughter
that
even
Lockhart
couldn
mistake
for
scream
terror
Yes
smiled
Seamus
Well
they
not
they
not
very
dangerous
are
they
Seamus
choked
Don
sure
said
Lockhart
waggling
finger
annoyingly
Seamus
Devilish
tricky
little
blighters
they
can
The
pixies
were
electric
blue
and
about
eight
inches
high
with
pointed
faces
and
voices
shrill
was
like
listening
lot
budgies
arguing
The
moment
the
cover
had
been
removed
they
101
had
started
jabbering
and
rocketing
around
rattling
the
bars
and
making
bizarre
faces
the
people
nearest
them
Right
then
Lockhart
said
loudly
Let
see
what
you
make
them
And
opened
the
cage
was
pandemonium
The
pixies
shot
every
direction
like
rockets
Two
them
seized
Neville
the
ears
and
lifted
him
into
the
air
Several
shot
straight
through
the
window
showering
the
back
row
with
broken
glass
The
rest
proceeded
wreck
the
classroom
more
effectively
than
rampaging
rhino
They
grabbed
ink
bottles
and
sprayed
the
class
with
them
shredded
books
and
papers
tore
pictures
from
the
walls
ended
the
waste
basket
grabbed
bags
and
books
and
threw
them
out
the
smashed
window
within
minutes
half
the
class
was
sheltering
under
desks
and
Neville
was
swinging
from
the
iron
chandelier
the
ceiling
Come
now
round
them
round
them
they
only
pixies
Lockhart
shouted
rolled
his
sleeves
brandished
his
wand
and
bellowed
Peskipiksi
Pesternomi
had
absolutely
effect
one
the
pixies
seized
his
wand
and
threw
out
the
window
too
Lockhart
gulped
and
dived
under
his
own
desk
narrowly
avoiding
being
squashed
Neville
who
fell
second
later
the
chandelier
gave
way
The
bell
rang
and
there
was
mad
rush
toward
the
exit
the
relative
calm
that
followed
Lockhart
straightened
caught
sight
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
who
were
almost
the
door
and
said
Well
ask
you
three
just
nip
the
rest
them
back
into
their
cage
swept
past
them
and
shut
the
door
quickly
behind
him
102
Can
you
believe
him
roared
Ron
one
the
remaining
pixies
bit
him
painfully
the
ear
just
wants
give
some
hands
experience
said
Hermione
immobilizing
two
pixies
once
with
clever
Freezing
Charm
and
stuffing
them
back
into
their
cage
Hands
said
Harry
who
was
trying
grab
pixie
dancing
out
reach
with
its
tongue
out
Hermione
didn
have
clue
what
was
doing
Rubbish
said
Hermione
You
read
his
books
look
all
those
amazing
things
done
says
done
Ron
muttered
arry
spent
lot
time
over
the
next
few
days
dodging
out
sight
whenever
saw
Gilderoy
Lockhart
coming
down
corridor
Harder
avoid
was
Colin
Creevey
who
seemed
have
memorized
Harry
schedule
Nothing
seemed
give
Colin
bigger
thrill
than
say
All
right
Harry
six
seven
times
day
and
hear
Hello
Colin
back
however
exasperated
Harry
sounded
when
said
Hedwig
was
still
angry
with
Harry
about
the
disasterous
car
journey
and
Ron
wand
was
still
malfunctioning
surpassing
itself
Friday
morning
shooting
out
Ron
hand
Charms
and
hitting
tiny
old
Professor
Flitwick
squarely
between
the
eyes
creating
large
throbbing
green
boil
where
had
struck
with
one
thing
and
another
Harry
was
quite
glad
reach
the
weekend
Ron
and
Hermione
were
planning
visit
Hagrid
Saturday
morning
Harry
however
was
shaken
awake
several
hours
earlier
104
than
would
have
liked
Oliver
Wood
Captain
the
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
Whassamatter
said
Harry
groggily
Quidditch
practice
said
Wood
Come
Harry
squinted
the
window
There
was
thin
mist
hanging
across
the
pink
and
gold
sky
Now
that
was
awake
couldn
understand
how
could
have
slept
through
the
racket
the
birds
were
making
Oliver
Harry
croaked
the
crack
dawn
Exactly
said
Wood
was
tall
and
burly
sixth
year
and
the
moment
his
eyes
were
gleaming
with
crazed
enthusiasm
part
our
new
training
program
Come
grab
your
broom
and
let
said
Wood
heartily
None
the
other
teams
have
started
training
yet
going
first
off
the
mark
this
year
Yawning
and
shivering
slightly
Harry
climbed
out
bed
and
tried
find
his
Quidditch
robes
Good
man
said
Wood
Meet
you
the
field
fifteen
minutes
When
found
his
scarlet
team
robes
and
pulled
his
cloak
for
warmth
Harry
scribbled
note
Ron
explaining
where
gone
and
went
down
the
spiral
staircase
the
common
room
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
his
shoulder
had
just
reached
the
portrait
hole
when
there
was
clatter
behind
him
and
Colin
Creevey
came
dashing
down
the
spiral
staircase
his
camera
swinging
madly
around
his
neck
and
something
clutched
his
hand
heard
someone
saying
your
name
the
stairs
Harry
Look
what
got
here
had
developed
wanted
show
you
105
Harry
looked
bemusedly
the
photograph
Colin
was
brandishing
under
his
nose
moving
black
and
white
Lockhart
was
tugging
hard
arm
Harry
recognized
his
own
was
pleased
see
that
his
photographic
self
was
putting
good
fight
and
refusing
dragged
into
view
Harry
watched
Lockhart
gave
and
slumped
panting
against
the
white
edge
the
picture
Will
you
sign
said
Colin
eagerly
said
Harry
flatly
glancing
around
check
that
the
room
was
really
deserted
Sorry
Colin
hurry
Quidditch
practice
climbed
through
the
portrait
hole
wow
Wait
for
never
watched
Quidditch
game
before
Colin
scrambled
through
the
hole
after
him
really
boring
Harry
said
quickly
but
Colin
ignored
him
his
face
shining
with
excitement
You
were
the
youngest
House
player
hundred
years
weren
you
Harry
Weren
you
said
Colin
trotting
alongside
him
You
must
brilliant
never
flown
easy
that
your
own
broom
that
the
best
one
there
Harry
didn
know
how
get
rid
him
was
like
having
extremely
talkative
shadow
don
really
understand
Quidditch
said
Colin
breathlessly
true
there
are
four
balls
And
two
them
fly
around
trying
knock
people
off
their
brooms
Yes
said
Harry
heavily
resigned
explaining
the
complicated
rules
Quidditch
They
called
Bludgers
There
are
two
Beaters
106
each
team
who
carry
clubs
beat
the
Bludgers
away
from
their
side
Fred
and
George
Weasley
are
the
Gryffindor
Beaters
And
what
are
the
other
balls
for
Colin
asked
tripping
down
couple
steps
because
was
gazing
open
mouthed
Harry
Well
the
Quafe
that
the
biggish
red
one
the
one
that
scores
goals
Three
Chasers
each
team
throw
the
Quaffle
each
other
and
try
and
get
through
the
goal
posts
the
end
the
pitch
they
three
long
poles
with
hoops
the
end
And
the
fourth
ball
the
Golden
Snitch
said
Harry
and
very
small
very
fast
and
difficult
catch
But
that
what
the
Seeker
got
because
game
Quidditch
doesn
end
until
the
Snitch
has
been
caught
And
whichever
team
Seeker
gets
the
Snitch
earns
his
team
extra
hundred
and
fifty
points
And
you
the
Gryffindor
Seeker
aren
you
said
Colin
awe
Yes
said
Harry
they
left
the
castle
and
started
across
the
dew
drenched
grass
And
there
the
Keeper
too
guards
the
goal
posts
That
really
But
Colin
didn
stop
questioning
Harry
all
the
way
down
the
sloping
lawns
the
Quidditch
field
and
Harry
only
shook
him
off
when
reached
the
changing
rooms
Colin
called
after
him
piping
voice
and
get
good
seat
Harry
and
hurried
off
the
stands
The
rest
the
Gryffindor
team
were
already
the
changing
room
Wood
was
the
only
person
who
looked
truly
awake
Fred
and
George
Weasley
were
sitting
puffy
eyed
and
touslehaired
next
fourth
year
Alicia
Spinnet
who
seemed
nodding
off
against
the
wall
behind
her
Her
fellow
Chasers
Katie
107
Bell
and
Angelina
Johnson
were
yawning
side
side
opposite
them
There
you
are
Harry
what
kept
you
said
Wood
briskly
Now
wanted
quick
talk
with
you
all
before
actually
get
onto
the
field
because
spent
the
summer
devising
whole
new
training
program
which
really
think
will
make
all
the
difference
Wood
was
holding
large
diagram
Quidditch
field
which
were
drawn
many
lines
arrows
and
crosses
differentcolored
inks
took
out
his
wand
tapped
the
board
and
the
arrows
began
wiggle
over
the
diagram
like
caterpillars
Wood
launched
into
speech
about
his
new
tactics
Fred
Weasley
head
drooped
right
onto
Alicia
Spinnet
shoulder
and
began
snore
The
first
board
took
nearly
twenty
minutes
explain
but
there
was
another
board
under
that
and
third
under
that
one
Harry
sank
into
stupor
Wood
droned
and
said
Wood
long
last
jerking
Harry
from
wistful
fantasy
about
what
could
eating
for
breakfast
this
very
moment
the
castle
that
clear
Any
questions
got
question
Oliver
said
George
who
had
woken
with
start
Why
couldn
you
have
told
all
this
yesterday
when
were
awake
Wood
wasn
pleased
Now
listen
here
you
lot
said
glowering
them
all
should
have
won
the
Quidditch
cup
last
year
easily
the
best
team
But
unfortunately
owing
circumstances
beyond
our
control
108
Harry
shifted
guiltily
his
seat
had
been
unconscious
the
hospital
wing
for
the
final
match
the
previous
year
meaning
that
Gryffindor
had
been
player
short
and
had
suffered
their
worst
defeat
three
hundred
years
Wood
took
moment
regain
control
himself
Their
last
defeat
was
clearly
still
torturing
him
this
year
train
harder
than
ever
before
Okay
let
and
put
our
new
theories
into
practice
Wood
shouted
seizing
his
broomstick
and
leading
the
way
out
the
locker
rooms
Stifflegged
and
still
yawning
his
team
followed
They
had
been
the
locker
room
long
that
the
sun
was
completely
now
although
remnants
mist
hung
over
the
grass
the
stadium
Harry
walked
onto
the
field
saw
Ron
and
Hermione
sitting
the
stands
Aren
you
finished
yet
called
Ron
incredulously
Haven
even
started
said
Harry
looking
jealously
the
toast
and
marmalade
Ron
and
Hermione
had
brought
out
the
Great
Hall
Wood
been
teaching
new
moves
mounted
his
broomstick
and
kicked
the
ground
soaring
into
the
air
The
cool
morning
air
whipped
his
face
waking
him
far
more
effectively
than
Wood
long
talk
felt
wonderful
back
the
Quidditch
field
soared
right
around
the
stadium
full
speed
racing
Fred
and
George
What
that
funny
clicking
noise
called
Fred
they
hurtled
around
the
corner
Harry
looked
into
the
stands
Colin
was
sitting
one
the
highest
seats
his
camera
raised
taking
picture
after
picture
the
sound
strangely
magnified
the
deserted
stadium
io9
Look
this
way
Harry
This
way
cried
shrilly
Who
that
said
Fred
idea
Harry
lied
putting
spurt
speed
that
took
him
far
away
possible
from
Colin
What
going
said
Wood
frowning
skimmed
through
the
air
toward
them
Why
that
first
year
taking
pictures
don
like
could
Slytherin
spy
trying
find
out
about
our
new
training
program
Gryffindor
said
Harry
quickly
And
the
Slytherins
don
need
spy
Oliver
said
George
What
makes
you
say
that
said
Wood
testily
Because
they
here
person
said
George
pointing
Several
people
green
robes
were
walking
onto
the
field
broomsticks
their
hands
don
believe
Wood
hissed
outrage
booked
the
field
for
today
see
about
this
Wood
shot
toward
the
ground
landing
rather
harder
than
meant
his
anger
staggering
slightly
dismounted
Harry
Fred
and
George
followed
Flint
Wood
bellowed
the
Slytherin
Captain
This
our
practice

specially
You

off
now
Marcus
Flint
was
even
larger
than
Wood
had
look
trollish
cunning
his
face
replied
Plenty
room
for
all
Wood
Angelina
Alicia
and
Katie
had
come
over
too
There
were
girls
the
Slytherin
team
who
stood
shoulder

facing
the
Gryffindors
leering

But

Wood
positively

with
rage

Flint
But

said
Wood
distracted
Where
And
from
behind
the
six
large
figures
before
them
came
seventh
smaller
boy
smirking
all
over
his
pale
pointed
face
was
Draco
Malfoy
Aren
you
Lucius
Malfoy
son
said
Fred
looking
Malfoy
with
dislike
Funny
you
should
mention
Draco
father
said
Flint
the
whole
Slytherin
team
smiled
still
more
broadly
Let
show
you
the
generous
gift
made
the
Slytherin
team
All
seven
them
held
out
their
broomsticks
Seven
highly
polished
brand
new
handles
and
seven
sets
fine
gold
lettering
spelling
the
words
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
and
One
gleamed
under
the
Gryffindors
noses
the
early
morning
sun
Very
latest
model
Only
came
out
last
month
said
Flint
carelessly
flicking
speck
dust
from
the
end
his
own
believe
outstrips
the
old
Two
Thousand
series
considerable
amount
for
the
old
Cleansweeps
smiled
nastily
Fred
and
George
who
were
both
clutching
Cleansweep
Fives
sweeps
the
board
with
them
None
the
Gryffindor
team
could
think
anything
say
for
moment
Malfoy
was
smirking
broadly
his
cold
eyes
were
reduced
slits

Flint
field
invasion
Ron
and
Hermione
were
crossing
the
grass
see
what
was
going
111
What
happening
Ron
asked
Harry
Why

you
playing
And
what
doing
here
was
looking
Malfoy
taking
his
Slytherin
Quidditch
robes
the
new
Slytherin
Seeker
Weasley
said
Malfoy
smugly
Everyone
just
been
admiring
the
brooms
father
bought
our
team
Ron
gaped
open
mouthed
the
seven
superb
broomsticks
front
him
Good
aren
they
said
Malfoy
smoothly
But
perhaps
the
Gryffindor
team
will
able
raise
some
gold
and
get
new
brooms
too
You
could
raffle
off
those
Cleansweep
Fives
expect
museum
would
bid
for
them
The
Slytherin
team
howled
with
laughter
least
one
the
Gryffindor
team
had
buy
their
way
said
Hermione
sharply
They
got
pure
talent
The
smug
look
Malfoy
face
flickered
one
asked
your
opinion
you
fiIthy
little
Mudblood
spat
Harry
knew
once
that
Malfoy
had
said
something
really
bad
because
there
was
instant
uproar
his
words
Flint
had
dive
front
Malfoy
stop
Fred
and
George
jumping
him
Alicia
shrieked
How
dare
you
and
Ron
plunged
his
hand
into
his
robes
pulled
out
his
wand
yelling
You
pay
for
that
one
Malfoy
and
pointed
furiously
under
Flint
arm
Malfoys
face
loud
bang
echoed
around
the
stadium
and
jet
green
light
shot
out
the
wrong
end
Ron
wand
hitting
him
the
stomach
and
sending
him
reeling
backward
onto
the
grass
Ron
Ron
Are
you
all
right
squealed
Hermione
Ron
opened
his
mouth
speak
but
words
came
out
Instead
gave
almighty
belch
and
several
slugs
dribbled
out
his
mouth
onto
his
lap
The
Slytherin
team
were
paralyzed
with
laughter
Flint
was
doubled
hanging
onto
his
new
broomstick
for
support
Malfoy
was
all
fours
banging
the
ground
with
his
fist
The
Gryffindors
were
gathered
around
Ron
who
kept
belching
large
glistening
slugs
Nobody
seemed
want
touch
him
better
get
him
Hagrid
nearest
said
Harry
Hermione
who
nodded
bravely
and
the
pair
them
pulled
Ron
the
arms
What
happened
Harry
What
happened
ill
But
you
can
cure
him
can
you
Colin
had
run
down
from
his
seat
and
was
now
dancing
alongside
them
they
left
the
field
Ron
gave
huge
heave
and
more
slugs
dribbled
down
his
front
Oooh
said
Colin
fascinated
and
raising
his
camera
Can
you
hold
him
still
Harry
Get
out
the
way
Colin
said
Harry
angrily
and
Hermione
supported
Ron
out
the
stadium
and
across
the
grounds
toward
the
edge
the
forest
Nearly
there
Ron
said
Hermione
the
gamekeeper
cabin
came
into
view
You

They

feet
Hagrid

when
the

but

Gilderoy
Lockhart
wearing
robes
palest
mauve

Quick

Harry

behind

bush
Hermione
followed
somewhat
reluctantly

Well

And
strode
away
toward
the
castle
Harry
waited
until
Lockhart
was
out
sight
then
pulled
Ron
out
the
bush
and
Hagrid
front
door
They
knocked
urgently
Hagrid
appeared
once
looking
very
grumpy
but
his
expression
brightened
when
saw
who
was
Bin

Professor
Lockhart
back
again
Harry
and
Hermione
supported
Ron
over
the
threshold
into
the
one
roomed
cabin
which
had
enormous
bed
one
corner
fire
crackling
merrily
the

Hagrid
didn

Ron

Harry
hastily

Better

cheerfully
plunking
large
copper
basin
front
him
Get

Ron
don

said
Hermione
anxiously
watching
Ron
bend
over
the
basin
That
difficult
curse
work
the
best
times
but
with
broken
wand
Hagrid
was
bustling
around
making
them
tea
His
boarhound
Fang
was
slobbering
over
Harry
What
did
Lockhart
want
with
you
Hagrid
Harry
asked
scratching
Fang
ears
Givin

114
Hagrid
moving

plucked
rooster
off
his

table
and
setting
down
the
teapot
Like

about

Hermione

said
Hagrid
offering
them
plate
treacle
fudge
while
Ron
coughed
squelchily
into
his
basin
mean
the
one
Gettin

said
Ron
hoarsely
emerging
over
the
tabletop
looking
pale
and
sweaty
Malfoy
called
her
Mudblood
Hagrid
Ron
dived
out

again
fresh
wave
slugs
made
their
appearance
Hagrid
looked
outraged

Hermione

she
said
But

gasped
Ron

parents
There

115
some
wizards
like
Malfoy
family
who

because
they
what
people
call
pure
blood
gave
small
burp
and
single
slug
fell
into
his
outstretched
hand
threw
into
the
basin

Ron

his
sweaty
brow
with
shaking
hand
Dirty

Muggles

Well

Ron
said
Hagrid
loudly
over
the
thuds
more
slugs
hitting
the
basin

backfired
Spect
Lucius
Malfoy

his

Least

Harry
would
have
pointed

much
worse
than

slugs
pouring
out
your
mouth
but
couldn
Hagrid
treacle

Harry

Hagrid
abruptly

hotly
Lockhart
still
spreading
that
around
116
But
then
saw
that
Hagrid
was
laughing

patting
Harry
genially
the
back
and
sending
him
face

into
the
table

Harry

Ron
weakly

Hagrid
Harry
and
Hermione
finished
the
last
their
tea
the
small
vegetable
patch
behind
Hagrid
house
were

the
largest
pumpkins
Harry
had

Each

Hagrid
happily

Harry
Hagrid
looked
over
his
shoulder
check
that
they
were
alone
Well

Harry
noticed
Hagrid
flowery
pink
umbrella
leaning
against
the
back
wall
the
cabin
Harry
had
had
reason
believe
before
now
that
this
umbrella
was
not
all
looked
fact
had
the
strong
impression
that
Hagrid
old
school
wand
was
concealed
inside
Hagrid
wasn
supposed
use
magic
had
been
expelled
from
Hogwarts
his
third
year
but
Harry
had
never
found
out
why
any
mention
the
matter
and
Hagrid
would
clear
his
117
throat
loudly
and
become
mysteriously
deaf
until
the
subject
was
changed
Engorgement
Charm

said
Hermione
halfway
between
disapproval
and
amusement
Well

That
what

said
Hagrid
nodding
Ron
Met

was
nearly

and
Harry
had
only
had
one
bit
treacle
fudge
since
dawn
was
keen

They
said
good

Hagrid
and
walked
back
the
castle
Ron
hiccoughing
occasionally
but
only
bringing
two
very
small
slugs
They
had
barely
set

There

Answering

Saturday
afternoon
seemed
melt
away
and
what
seemed
like
time
was
five
minutes
eight
and
Harry
was
dragging
his
feet
along
the
second
floor
corridor
Lockhart
office
gritted
his
teeth
and
knocked
The
door
flew
open
once
Lockhart
beamed
down
him
here
the
scalawag
said
Come
Harry
come
Shining
brightly
the
walls
the
light
many
candles
were
countless
framed
photographs
Lockhart
had
even
signed
few
them
Another
large
pile
lay
his
desk
You

Lockhart
told
Harry
though
this
was
huge
treat
This
first
one
Gladys
Gudgeon

her
huge

The
minutes
snailed
Harry
let
Lockhart
voice
wash
over
him
occasionally
saying
Mmm
and
Right
and
Yeah
Now
and
then
caught
phrase
like
Fame
fickle
friend
Harry
Celebrity
celebrity
does
remember
that
The
candles
burned
lower
and
lower
making
the
light
dance
over
the
many
moving
faces
Lockhart
watching
him
Harry
moved
his
aching
hand
over
what
felt
like
the
thousandth
envelope
writing
out
Veronica
Smethley
address
must
nearly
time
leave
Harry
thought
miserably
please
let
nearly
time
And
then
heard
something
something
quite
apart
from
the
spitting
the
dying
candles
and
Lockhart
prattle
about
his
fans
was
voice
voice
chill
the
bone
marrow
voice
breathtaking
ice
cold
venom
Come

Let
rip

Let

Harry
gave
huge
jump
and

appeared

Six

Harry
frantically

Lockhart

That

Lockhart

What

Harry
didn

was
straining
his
ears
hear
the
voice
again
but
there
was
sound
now
except
for
Lockhart
telling
him
mustn
expect

like
this
every
time

Feeling
dazed
Harry
left
was
late
that
the
Gryffindor

was
almost
empty
Harry
went

Ron
wasn
back

Harry
pulled
his

into

Half

October

Madam

Her

smoking

Ginny

who
had

into

The

one
stormy
Saturday
afternoon
few
days
before
Halloween
returning
Gryffindor
Tower
drenched
the
skin
and
splattered
with

123
Even
aside
from
the
rain
and
wind
hadn
been
happy
practice
session
Fred
and
George
who
had
been
spying
the
Slytherin
team
had
seen
for
themselves
the
speed
those
new
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
and
Ones
They
reported
that
the
Slytherin
team
was
more
than
seven
greenish
blurs
shooting
through
the
air
like
missiles
Harry
squelched
along
the
deserted
corridor
came
across
somebody
who
looked
just
preoccupied
was
Nearly
Headless
Nick
the
ghost
Gryffindor
Tower
was
staring
morosely
out
window
muttering
under
his
breath
don
fulfill
their
requirements
half
inch
that
Hello
Nick
said
Harry
Hello
hello
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
starting
and
looking
round
wore
dashing
plumed
hat
his
long
curly
hair
and
tunic
with
ruff
which
concealed
the
fact
that
his
neck
was
almost
completely
severed
was
pale
smoke
and
Harry
could
see
right
through
him
the
dark
sky
and
torrential
rain
outside
You
look
troubled
young
Potter

Nick
folding
transparent

and
tucking

Thought

apparently

spite
his

there
was

his
face
But

would
think
wouldn
you
erupted
suddenly
pulling
the
letter
back
out
his
pocket
that
getting
hit
forty
five
times
the

with
blunt
axe
would
qualify
you

124
yes
said
Harry
who
was
obviously
supposed
agree
mean
nobody
wishes
more
than
that
had
all
been
quick
and
clean
and
head
had
come
off
properly
mean
would
have
saved
great
deal
pain
and
ridicule
However
Nearly
Headless
Nick
shook
his
letter
open
and
read
furiously

Sir

Delaney
Podmore
Fuming
Nearly
Headless
Nick
stuffed
the

away
Half

Harry
Most
people
would
think
that
good
and
beheaded
but
not
enough
for
Sir
Properly
Decapitated
Podmore
Nearly
Headless
Nick
took
several
deep
breaths
and
then
said

calmer
tone
what

Anything

Harry
Not

where

The

Harry
sentence
was
drowned
out
high
pitched
mewling
from
somewhere
near
his
ankles
looked
down
and
found
himself
gazing
into
pair
lamp
like
yellow
eyes
was
Mrs
Norris
the
skeletal
gray
cat
who
was
used
the
caretaker
Argus
Filch
sort
deputy
his
endless
battle
against

You

Harry
said
Nick

Right
said
Harry
backing
away
from
the
accusing
stare
Mrs
Norris
but
not
quickly
enough
Drawn
the
spot
the
mysterious
power
that
seemed
connect
him
with
his
foul
cat
Argus
Filch
burst
suddenly
through
tapestry
Harry
right
wheezing
and
looking
wildly
about
for
the
rule
breaker
There
was
thick
tartan
scarf
bound
around
his
head
and
his
nose
was
unusually
purple
Filth
shouted
his
jowls
aquiver
his
eyes
popping
alarmingly
pointed
the
muddy
puddle
that
had
dripped
from
Harry
Quidditch

Mess

everywhere
had
enough
tell
you
Follow

Harry
waved
gloomy
good
bye
Nearly
Headless
Nick
and
followed
Filch
back
downstairs
doubling
the
number
muddy
footprints
the
floor
Harry
had
never
been
inside
Filch
office
before
was
place
most
students
avoided
The
room
was
dingy
and
windowless
lit
single
oil
lamp
dangling
from
the
low
ceiling
faint
smell
fried
fish
lingered
about
the
place
Wooden
filing
cabinets
stood
around
the
walls
from
their
labels
Harry
could
see
that
they
contained
details
every
pupil
Filch
had
ever
punished
Fred
and
George
Weasley
had
entire
drawer
themselves
highly
polished
collection
chains
and
manacles
hung
the
wall
behind
Filch
desk
was
common
knowledge
that
was
always
begging
Dumbledore
let
him
suspend
students
their
ankles
from
the
ceiling
Filch
grabbed
quill
from
pot
his
desk
and
began
shuffling
around
looking
for
parchment
Dung
muttered
furiously
great
sizzling
dragon

had
enough
make

where
the
form

126
retrieved
large
roll
parchment
from
his

and
stretched
out

him
dipping
his
long
black
quill
into
the
ink
pot

Dabbing
his

Filch
squinted
unpleasantly
Harry
who
waited
with
bated
breath
for
his
sentence
fall
But
Filch
lowered
his
quill
there
was
great
BANG
the
ceiling
the
office
which
made
the
oil
lamp
rattle
PEEVES
Filch
roared
flinging
down
his
quill
transport
rage
have
you
this
time
have
you
And
without
backward
glance
Harry
Filch
ran
flat
footed
from
the
office
Mrs
Norris
streaking
alongside
him
Peeves
was
the
school
poltergeist
grinning
airborne
menace
who
lived
cause
havoc
and
distress
Harry
didn
much
like
Peeves
but
couldn
help
feeling
grateful
for
his
timing
Hopefully
whatever
Peeves
had
done
and
sounded
though
wrecked
something
very
big
this
time
would
distract
Filch
from
Harry
Thinking
that
should
probably
wait
for
Filch
come
back
Harry
sank
into
moth
eaten
chair
next
the
desk
There
was
only
one
thing
apart
from
his
half
completed
form
large
glossy
purple
envelope
with
silver
lettering
the
front
With
quick
glance
the
door
check
that
Filch
wasn
his
way
back
Harry
picked
the
envelope
and
read

Intrigued
Harry
flicked
the

open
and
pulled
out
the

Fascinated
Harry
thumbed
through
the
rest
the
envelope
contents
Why
earth
did
Filch
want
Kwikspell
course
Did
this
mean
wasn
proper

Harry
was
just
reading

when
shuffling
footsteps
outside
told
him
Filch
was
coming
back
Stuffing
the
parchment
back
into
the
envelope
Harry
threw
back
onto
the
desk
just
the
door
opened
Filch
was
looking
triumphant
That
vanishing
cabinet
was
extremely
valuable
was
saying
gleefully
Mrs
Norris
have
Peeves
out
this
time
sweet
His
eyes
fell
Harry
and
then
darted
the
Kwikspell
envelope
which
Harry
realized
too
late
was
lying
two
feet
away
from
where
had
started
Filch
pasty
face
went
brick
red
Harry
braced
himself
for
tidal
wave
fury
Filch
hobbled
across
his
desk
snatched
the
envelope
and
threw
into
drawer
Have
you
did
you
read
sputtered
128
Harry
lied
quickly
Filch
knobbly
hands
were
twisting
together
thought
you
read
private
not
that
mine
for
friend
that
may
however
Harry
was
staring
him
alarmed
Filch
had
never
looked
madder
His
eyes
were
popping
tic
was
going
one
his
pouchy
cheeks
and
the
tartan
scarf
didn
help
Very
well
and
don
breathe
word
not
that
however
you
didn
read
now
have
write
Peeves
report
Amazed
his
luck
Harry
sped
out
the
office
the
corridor
and
back
upstairs
escape
from
Filch
office
without
punishment
was
probably
some
kind
school
record
Harry
Harry
Did
work
Nearly
Headless
Nick
came
gliding
out
classroom
Behind
him
Harry
could
see
the
wreckage

cabinet
that
appeared

been
dropped
from

Peeves

said
Nick
eagerly
Thought
might
distract
him
Was

said
Harry
gratefully
Yeah

get

Thanks
Nick
They
set
off
the
corridor
together
Nearly

Nick
Harry
noticed

wish
there
was
something

you
about

Harry
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
stopped
his
tracks
and
Harry
walked
right
through
him
wished
hadn
was
like
stepping
through
icy
shower
But
there
something
you
could
for
said
Nick
excitedly
Harry
would
asking
too
much
but
you
wouldn
want
What
said
Harry
Well

Halloween

hundredth

Nearly
Headless
Nick
drawing
himself
and
looking
dignified
said
Harry
not
sure
whether
should
look
sorry
happy
about
this
Right

Ron

grumpy
Sounds
dead
depressing
Rain
was
still
lashing
the
windows
which
were
now
inky
black
but
inside
all
looked
bright
and
cheerful
The
firelight
glowed
over
the

when
the
salamander
suddenly
whizzed
into
the
air
emitting
loud
sparks
and
bangs
whirled
wildly
round
the
room
The
sight
Percy
bellowing
himself
hoarse
Fred
and
George
the
spectacular
display
tangerine
stars
showering
from
the
salamander
mouth
and
its
escape
into
the
fire
with
accompanying
explosions
drove
both
Filch
and
the
Kwikspell
envelope
from
Harry
mind
the
time
Halloween
arrived
Harry
was
regretting
his
rash
promise
the
deathday
party
The
rest
the
school
was
happily
anticipating
their
Halloween
feast
the
Great

been
decorated
with
the
usual
live
bats
Hagrid
vast
pumpkins
had
been
carved
into
lanterns
large
enough
for
three
men
sit
and
there
were
rumors
that
Dumbledore
had
booked
troupe
dancing
skeletons
for
the
entertainment
promise

Hermione
reminded
Harry
bossily
You
said
you
the
deathday
party
seven
clock
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
walked
straight
past
the
doorway
the
packed
Great
Hall
which
was
glittering
invitingly
with
gold
plates
and
candles
and
directed
their
steps
instead
toward
the
dungeons
131
The
passageway
leading
Nearly
Headless
Nick
party
had
been
lined
with
candles
too
though
the
effect
was
far
from
cheerful
These
were
long
thin
jet
black
tapers
all
burning
bright
blue
casting
dim
ghostly
light
even
over
their
own
living
faces
The
temperature
dropped
with
every
step
they
took
Harry
shivered
and
drew
his
robes
tightly
around
him
heard
what
sounded
like
thousand
fingernails
scraping
enormous
blackboard
that
supposed
music
Ron
whispered
They
turned
corner
and
saw
Nearly
Headless
Nick
standing
doorway
hung
with
black
velvet
drapes
dear
friends
said
mournfully
Welcome
welcome
pleased
you
could
come
swept
off
his
plumed
hat
and
bowed
them
inside
was
incredible
sight
The
dungeon
was
full
hundreds
pearly
white
translucent
people
mostly
drifting
around
crowded
dance
floor
waltzing
the
dreadful
quavering
sound
thirty
musical
saws
played
orchestra
raised
black
draped
platform
chandelier
overhead
blazed
midnight
blue
with
thousand
more
black
candles
Their
breath
rose
mist
before
them
was
like
stepping
into
freezer
Shall
have
look
around
Harry
suggested
wanting
warm
his
feet
Careful
not
walk
through
anyone
said
Ron
nervously
and
they
set
off
around
the
edge
the
dance
floor
They
passed
group
gloomy
nuns
ragged
man
wearing
chains
and
the
Fat
Friar
cheerful
Hufflepuff
ghost
who
was
talking
knight
with
arrow
sticking
out
his
forehead
Harry
wasn
surprised
see
that
the
Bloody
Baron
gaunt
staring
Slytherin
ghost
covered
silver
bloodstains
was
being
given
wide
berth
the
other
ghosts
132
said
Hermione
stopping
abruptly
Turn
back
turn
back
don
want
talk
Moaning
Myrtle
Who
said
Harry
they
backtracked
quickly
She
haunts
one
the
toilets
the
girls
bathroom
the
first
floor
said
Hermione
She
haunts
toilet
Yes
been
out
order
all
year
because
she
keeps
having
tantrums
and
flooding
the
place
never
went
there
anyway
could
avoid
awful
trying
have
pee
with
her
wailing
you
Look
food
said
Ron
the
other
side
the
dungeon
was
long
table
also
covered
black
velvet
They
approached
eagerly
but
next
moment
had
stopped
their
tracks
horrified
The
smell
was
quite
disgusting
Large
rotten
fish
were
laid
handsome
silver
platters
cakes
burned
charcoal
black
were
heaped
salvers
there
was
great
maggoty
haggis
slab
cheese
covered
furry
green
mold
and
pride
place
enormous
gray
cake
the
shape
tombstone
with
tar
like
icing
forming
the
words
Sir
Nicholas
Mimsy
Porpington

31st
October
1492
Harry
watched
amazed
portly
ghost
approached
the
table
crouched
low
and
walked
through
his
mouth
held
wide
that
passed
through
one
the
stinking
salmon
Can
you
taste
you
walk
though
Harry
asked
him
Almost
said
the
ghost
sadly
and
drifted
away
133
expect
they
let
rot
give
stronger
flavor
said
Hermione
knowledgeably
pinching
her
nose
and
leaning
closer
look
the
putrid
haggis
Can
move
feel
sick
said
Ron
They
had
barely
turned
around
however
when
little
man
swooped
suddenly
from
under
the
table
and
came
halt
midair
before
them
Hello
Peeves
said
Harry
cautiously
Unlike
the
ghosts
around
them
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
was
the
very
reverse
pale
and
transparent
was
wearing
bright
orange
party
hat
revolving
bow
tie
and
broad
grin
his
wide
wicked
face
Nibbles
said
sweetly
offering
them
bowl
peanuts
covered
fungus
thanks
said
Hermione
Heard
you
talking
about
poor
Myrtle
said
Peeves
his
eyes
dancing
Rude
you
was
about
poor
Myrtle
took
deep
breath
and
bellowed
MYRTLE
Peeves
don
tell
her
what
said
she
really
upset
Hermione
whispered
frantically
didn
mean
don
mind
her
hello
Myrtle
The
squat
ghost
girl
had
glided
over
She
had
the
glummest
face
Harry
had
ever
seen
half
hidden
behind
lank
hair
and
thick
pearly
spectacles
What
she
said
sulkily
How
are
you
Myrtle
said
Hermione
falsely
bright
voice
nice
see
you
out
the
toilet
134
Myrtle
sniffed
Miss
Granger
was
just
talking
about
you
said
Peeves
slyly
Myrtle
ear
Just
saying
saying
how
nice
you
look
tonight
said
Hermione
glaring
Peeves
Myrtle
eyed
Hermione
suspiciously
You
making
fun
she
said
silver
tears
welling
rapidly
her
small
see
through
eyes
honestly
didn
just
say
how
nice
Myrtle
looking
said
Hermione
nudging
Harry
and
Ron
painfully
the
ribs
yeah
She
did
Don
lie
Myrtle
gasped
tears
now
flooding
down
her
face
while
Peeves
chuckled
happily
over
her
shoulder
you
think
don
know
what
people
call
behind
back
Fat
Myrtle
Ugly
Myrtle
Miserable
moaning
moping
Myrtle
You
forgotten
pimply
Peeves
hissed
her
ear
Moaning
Myrtle
burst
into
anguished
sobs
and
fled
from
the
dungeon
Peeves
shot
after
her
pelting
her
with
moldy
peanuts
yelling
Pimply
Pimply
dear
said
Hermione
sadly
Nearly
Headless
Nick
now
drifted
toward
them
through
the
crowd
135
Enjoying
yourselves
yes
they
lied
Not
bad
turnout
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
proudly
The
Wailing
Widow
came
all
the
way
from
Kent
nearly
time
for
speech
better
and
warn
the
orchestra
The
orchestra
however
stopped
playing
that
very
moment
They
and
everyone
else
the
dungeon
fell
silent
looking
around
excitement
hunting
horn
sounded
here
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
bitterly
Through
the
dungeon
wall
burst
dozen
ghost
horses
each
ridden
headless
horseman
The
assembly
clapped
wildly
Harry
started
clap
too
but
stopped
quickly
the
sight
Nick
face
The
horses
galloped
into
the
middle
the
dance
floor
and
halted
rearing
and
plunging
the
front
the
pack
was
large
ghost
who
held
his
bearded
head
under
his
arm
from
which
position
was
blowing
the
horn
The
ghost
leapt
down
lifted
his
head
high
the
air
could
see
over
the
crowd
everyone
laughed
and
strode
over
Nearly
Headless
Nick
squashing
his
head
back
onto
his
neck
Nick
roared
How
are
you
Head
still
hanging
there
gave
hearty
guffaw
and
clapped
Nearly
Headless
Nick
the
shoulder
Welcome
Patrick
said
Nick
stiffly
Live
uns
said
Sir
Patrick
spotting
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
and
giving
huge
fake
jump
astonishment
that
his
head
fell
off
again
the
crowd
howled
with
laughter
136
Very
amusing
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
darkly
Don
mind
Nick
shouted
Sir
Patrick
head
from
the
floor
Still
upset
won
let
him
join
the
Hunt
But
mean
say
look
the
fellow

said
Harry
hurriedly
meaningful
look
from
Nick
Nick
very
frightening
and
yelled
Sir
Patrick
head
Bet
asked
you
say
that
could
have
everyone
attention
time
for
speech
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
loudly
striding
toward
the
podium
and
climbing
into
icy
blue
spotlight
late
lamented
lords
ladies
and
gentlemen
great
sorrow
But
nobody
heard
much
more
Sir
Patrick
and
the
rest
the
Headless
Hunt
had
just
started
game
Head
Hockey
and
the
crowd
were
turning
watch
Nearly
Headless
Nick
tried
vainly
recapture
his
audience
but
gave
Sir
Patrick
head
went
sailing
past
him
loud
cheers
Harry
was
very
cold
now
not
mention
hungry
can
stand
much
more
this
Ron
muttered
his
teeth
chattering
the
orchestra
ground
back
into
action
and
the
ghosts
swept
back
onto
the
dance
floor
Let
Harry
agreed
They
backed
toward
the
door
nodding
and
beaming
anyone
who
looked
them
and
minute
later
were
hurrying
back
the
passageway
full
black
candles
Pudding
might
not
finished
yet
said
Ron
hopefully
leading
the
way
toward
the
steps
the
entrance
hall
137
And
then
Harry
heard
rip
tear
kill
was
the
same
voice
the
same
cold
murderous
voice
had
heard
Lockhart
office
stumbled
halt
clutching
the
stone
wall
listening
with
all
his
might
looking
around
squinting
and
down
the
dimly
lit
passageway
Harry
what
you
that
voice
again
shut
minute
soo
hungry
for
long
Listen
said
Harry
urgently
and
Ron
and
Hermione
froze
watching
him
kill
time
kill
The
voice
was
growing
fainter
Harry
was
sure
was
moving
away
moving
upward
mixture
fear
and
excitement
gripped
him
stared
the
dark
ceiling
how
could
moving
upward
Was
phantom
whom
stone
ceilings
didn
matter
This
way
shouted
and
began
run
the
stairs
into
the
entrance
hall
was
good
hoping
hear
anything
here
the
babble
talk
from
the
Halloween
feast
was
echoing
out
the
Great
Hall
Harry
sprinted
the
marble
staircase
the
first
floor
Ron
and
Hermione
clattering
behind
him
Harry
what
SHH
138
Harry
strained
his
ears
Distantly
from
the
floor
above
and
growing
fainter
still
heard
the
voice
smell
blood
SMELL
BLOOD
His
stomach
lurched
going
kill
someone
shouted
and
ignoring
Ron
and
Hermione
bewildered
faces
ran
the
next
flight
steps
three
time
trying
listen
over
his
own
pounding
footsteps
Harry
hurtled
around
the
whole
the
second
floor
Ron
and
Hermione
panting
behind
him
not
stopping
until
they
turned
corner
into
the
last
deserted
passage
Harry
what
was
that
all
about
said
Ron
wiping
sweat
off
his
face
couldn
hear
anything
But
Hermione
gave
sudden
gasp
pointing
down
the
corridor
Look
Something
was
shining
the
wall
ahead
They
approached
slowly
squinting
through
the
darkness
Foot
high
words
had
been
daubed
the
wall
between
two
windows
shimmering
the
light
cast
the
flaming
torches
the
chamber
secrets
has
been
opened
enemies
the
heir
beware
What
that
thing
hanging
underneath
said
Ron
slight
quiver
his
voice
they
edged
nearer
Harry
almost
slipped
there
was
large
puddle
water
the
floor
Ron
and
Hermione
grabbed
him
and
they
inched
toward
the
message
eyes
fixed
dark
shadow
beneath
All
three
them
realized
what
was
once
and
leapt
backward
with
splash
Mrs
Norris
the
caretaker
cat
was
hanging
her
tail
from
the
torch
bracket
She
was
stiff
board
her
eyes
wide
and
staring
For
few
seconds
they
didn
move
Then
Ron
said
Let
get
out
here
Shouldn
try
and
help
Harry
began
awkwardly
Trust
said
Ron
don
want
found
here
But
was
too
late
rumble
though
distant
thunder
told
them
that
the
feast
had
just
ended
From
either
end
the
corridor
where
they
stood
came
the
sound
hundreds
feet
climbing
the
stairs
and
the
loud
happy
talk
well
fed
people
next
moment
students
were
crashing
into
the
passage
from
both
ends
The
chatter
the
bustle
the
noise
died
suddenly
the
people
front
spotted
the
hanging
cat
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stood
alone
the
middle
the
corridor
silence
fell
among
the
mass
students
pressing
forward
see
the
grisly
sight
Then
someone
shouted
through
the
quiet
Enemies

Heir
beware
You
next
Mudbloods
was
Draco
Malfoy
had
pushed
the
front
the
crowd
his
cold
eyes
alive
his

bloodless
face

hanging
immobile
cat

Then

And

Dumbledore
The
silent
crowd
parted
let
them
pass
Lockhart
looking
excited
and
important
hurried
after
Dumbledore
did
Professors
McGonagall
and
Snape
they
entered
Lockhart
darkened
office
there
was
flurry
movement
across
the
walls
Harry
saw
several
the
Lockharts
the
pictures
dodging
out

their
hair
rollers
The
real
Lockhart
lit
the
candles
his
desk
and
stood
back
Dumbledore
lay
Mrs
Norris
the
polished
surface
and
began
examine
her
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
exchanged
tense
looks
and
sank
into
chairs
outside
the
pool

The

and
poking
Professor
McGonagall

almost
close
her

Snape
loomed
behind
them
half
shadow
wearing
most
peculiar
expression
was
though
was
trying
hard
not

And
Lockhart
was
hovering
around
all

definitely

that

Transmogrifian
Torture

sorry
for

though
not
nearly
sorry
felt
for
himself
Dumbledore
believed
Filch
would
expelled
for
sure
Dumbledore
was
now
muttering
strange
words
under
his
breath
and
tapping
Mrs
Norris
with
his
wand
but
nothing

She
continued

Snape
from

Harry

forboding
increased
was
sure
nothing
Snape
had
say

going

any

Potter

the

Why

Why

into

hundreds
ghosts
theyll
tell
you
were
there
But
why
not
join
the
feast
afterward
said
Snape
his
black
eyes
glittering
the
candlelight
Why
that
corridor
Ron
and
Hermione
looked
Harry
Because
because
Harry
said
his

There

Dumbledore
was
giving
Harry
searching
look
His

Harry
feel

They
went
quickly
they
could
without
actually
running
When
they
were
floor
from
Lockhart
office
they
turned
into
144
empty
classroom
and
closed
the
door
quietly
behind
them
Harry
squinted
his
friends
darkened
faces
you
think
should
have
told
them
about
that
voice
heard
said
Ron
without
hesitation
Hearing
voices
one
else
can
hear
isn
good
sign
even
the
wizarding
world
Something
Ron
voice
made
Harry
ask
You
believe
don
you
Course
said
Ron
quickly
But
you
must
admit
weird
know
weird
said
Harry
The
whole
thing
weird
What
was
that
writing
the
wall
about
The
Cbamber
Has
Been
Opened
What
that
supposed
mean
You
know
rings
sort
bell
said
Ron
slowly
think
someone
told
story
about
secret
chamber
Hogwarts
once
might
been
Bill
And
what
earth
Squib
said
Harry
his
surprise
Ron
stifled
snigger
Well
not
funny
really
but
Filch
said
Squib
someone
who
was
born
into
wizarding
family
but
hasn
got
any
magic
powers
Kind
the
opposite
Muggle
born
wizards
but
Squibs
are
quite
unusual
Filch
trying
learn
magic
from
Kwikspell
course
reckon
must
Squib
would
explain
lot
Like
why
hates
students
much
Ron
gave
satisfied
smile
bitter
clock
chimed
somewhere
Midnight
said
Harry
better
get
bed
before
Snape
comes
along
and
tries
frame
for
something
else
145
For
few
days
the
school
could
talk
little
else
but
the
attack
Mrs
Norris
Filch
kept
fresh
everyone
minds
pacing
the
spot
where
she
had
been
attacked
though
thought
the
attacker
might
come
back
Harry
had
seen
him
scrubbing
the
message
the
wall
with
Mrs
Skower
All
Purpose
Magical
Mess
Remover
but
effect
the
words
still
gleamed
brightly
ever
the
stone
When
Filch
wasn
guarding
the
scene
the
crime
was
skulking
red
eyed
through
the
corridors
lunging
out
unsuspecting
students
and
trying
put
them
detention
for
things
like
breathing
loudly
and
looking
happy
Ginny
Weasley
seemed
very
disturbed
Mrs
Norris
fate
According
Ron
she
was
great
cat
lover
But
you
haven
really
got
know
Mrs
Norris
Ron
told
her
bracingly
Honestly
much
better
off
without
her
Ginny
lip
trembled
Stuff
like
this
doesn
often
happen
Hogwarts
Ron
assured
her
They
catch
the
maniac
who
did
and
have
him
out
here
time
just
hope
got
time
Petrify
Filch
before
expelled
only
joking
Ron
added
hastily
Ginny
blanched
The
attack
had
also
had
effect
Hermione
was
quite
usual
for
Hermione
spend
lot
time
reading
but
she
was
now
doing
almost
nothing
else
Nor
could
Harry
and
Ron
get
much
response
from
her
when
they
asked
what
she
was
and
not
until
the
following
Wednesday
did
they
find
out
Harry
had
been
held
back
Potions
where
Snape
had
made
him
stay
behind
scrape
tubeworms
off
the
desks
After
hurried
lunch
went
upstairs
meet
Ron
the
library
and
saw
Justin
Finch
Fletchley
the
Hufflepuff
boy
from
Herbology
coming
146
toward
him
Harry
had
just
opened
his
mouth
say
hello
when
Justin
caught
sight
him
turned
abruptly
and
sped
off
the
opposite
direction
Harry
found
Ron
the
back
the
library
measuring
his
History
Magic
homework
Professor
Binns
had
asked
for
threefoot
long
composition
The
Medieval
Assembly
European
Wizards
don
believe
still
eight
inches
short
said
Ron
riously
letting
his
parchment
which
sprang
back
into
roll
And
Hermione
done
four
feet
seven
inches
and
her
writing
tiny
Where
she
asked
Harry
grabbing
the
tape
measure
and
unrolling
his
own
homework
Somewhere
over
there
said
Ron
pointing
along
the
shelves
Looking
for
another
book
think
she
trying
read
the
whole
library
before
Christmas
Harry
told
Ron
about
Justin
Finch
Fletchley
running
away
from
him
Dunno
why
you
care
thought
was
bit
idiot
said
Ron
scribbling
away
making
his
writing
large
possible
All
that
junk
about
Lockhart
being
great
Hermione
emerged
from
between
the
bookshelves
She
looked
irritable
and
last
seemed
ready
talk
them
All
the
copies
Hogwarts
History
have
been
taken
out
she
said
sitting
down
next
Harry
and
Ron
And
there
two
week
waiting
list
wish
hadn
left
copy
home
but
couldn
fit
trunk
with
all
the
Lockhart
books
Why
you
want
said
Harry
141
The
same
reason
everyone
else
wants
said
Hermione
read
the
legend
the
Chamber
Secrets
What
that
said
Harry
quickly
That
just
can
remember
said
Hermione
biting
her
lip
And
can
find
the
story
anywhere
else
Hermione
let
read
your
composition
said
Ron
desperately
checking
his
watch
won
said
Hermione
suddenly
severe
You
had
ten
days
finish
only
need
another
two
inches
come
The
bell
rang
Ron
and
Hermione
led
the
way
History
Magic
bickering
History
Magic
was
the
dullest
subject
their
schedule
Professor
Binns
who
taught
was
their
only
ghost
teacher
and
the
most
exciting
thing
that
ever
happened
his
classes
was
his
entering
the
room
through
the
blackboard
Ancient
and
shriveled
many
people
said
hadn
noticed
was
dead
had
simply
got
teach
one
day
and
left
his
body
behind
him
armchair
front
the
staff
room
fire
his
routine
had
not
varied
the
slightest
since
Today
was
boring
ever
Professor
Binns
opened
his
notes
and
began
read
flat
drone
like
old
vacuum
cleaner
until
nearly
everyone
the
class
was
deep
stupor
occasionally
coming
long
enough
copy
down
name
date
then
falling
asleep
again
had
been
speaking
for
half
hour
when
something
happened
that
had
never
happened
before
Hermione
put
her
hand
Professor
Binns
glancing
the
middle
deadly
dull
lec
148
ture
the
International
Warlock
Convention
1289
looked
amazed
Miss
Granger
Professor
was
wondering
you
could
tell
anything
about
the
Chamber
Secrets
said
Hermione
clear
voice
Dean
Thomas
who
had
been
sitting
with
his
mouth
hanging
open
gazing
out
the
window
jerked
out
his
trance
Lavender
Brown
head
came
off
her
arms
and
Neville
Longbottom
elbow
slipped
off
his
desk
Professor
Binns
blinked
subject
History
Magic
said
his
dry
wheezy
voice
deal
with
facts
Miss
Granger
not
myths
and
legends
cleared
his
throat
with
small
noise
like
chalk
ping
and
continued
September
that
year
subcommittee
Sardinian
sorcerers
stuttered
halt
Hermione
hand
was
waving
the
air
again
Miss
Grant
Please
sir
don
legends
always
have
basis
fact
Professor
Binns
was
looking
her
such
amazement
Harry
was
sure
student
had
ever
interrupted
him
before
alive
dead
Well
said
Professor
Binns
slowly
yes
one
could
argue
that
suppose
peered
Hermione
though
had
never
seen
student
properly
before
However
the
legend
which
you
speak
such
very
sensational
even
ludicrous
tale
But
the
whole
class
was
now
hanging
Professor
Binns
every
word
looked
dimly
them
all
every
face
turned
his
Harry
149
could
tell
was
completely
thrown
such
unusual
show
interest
very
well
said
slowly
Let
see
the
Chamber
Secrets
You
all
know
course
that
Hogwarts
was
founded
over
thousand
years
ago
the
precise
date
uncertain
the
four
greatest
witches
and
wizards
the
age
The
four
school
Houses
are
named
after
them
Godric
Gryffindor
Helga
Hufflepuff
Rowena
Ravenclaw
and
Salazar
Slytherin
They
built
this
castle
together
far
from
prying
Muggle
eyes
for
was
age
when
magic
was
feared
common
people
and
witches
and
wizards
suffered
much
persecution
paused
gazed
blearily
around
the
room
and
continued
For
few
years
the
founders
worked
harmony
together
seeking
out
youngsters
who
showed
signs
magic
and
bringing
them
the
castle
educated
But
then
disagreements
sprang
between
them
rift
began
grow
between
Slytherin
and
the
others
Slytherin
wished
more
selective
about
the
students
admitted
Hogwarts
believed
that
magical
learning
should
kept
within
all
magic
families
disliked
taking
students
Muggle
parentage
believing
them
untrustworthy
After
while
there
was
serious
argument
the
subject
between
Slytherin
and
Gryffindor
and
Slytherin
left
the
school
Professor
Binns
paused
again
pursing
his
lips
looking
like
wrinkled
old
tortoise
Reliable
historical
sources
tell
this
much
said
But
these
honest
facts
have
been
obscured
the
fanciful
legend
the
Chamber
Secrets
The
story
goes
that
Slytherin
had
built
150
hidden
chamber
the
castle
which
the
other
founders
knew
nothing
Slytherin
according
the
legend
sealed
the
Chamber
Secrets
that
none
would
able
open
until
his
own
true
heir
arrived
the
school
The
heir
alone
would
able
unseal
the
Chamber
Secrets
unleash
the
horror
within
and
use
purge
the
school
all
who
were
unworthy
study
magic
There
was
silence
finished
telling
the
story
but
wasn
the
usual
sleepy
silence
that
filled
Professor
Binns
classes
There
was
unease
the
air
everyone
continued
watch
him
hoping
for
more
Professor
Binns
looked
faintly
annoyed
The
whole
thing
arrant
nonsense
course
said
Naturally
the
school
has
been
searched
for
evidence
such
chamber
many
times
the
most
learned
witches
and
wizards
does
not
exist
tale
told
frighten
the
gullible
Hermione
hand
was
back
the
air
Sir
what
exactly
you
mean
the
horror
within
the
Chamber
That
believed
some
sort
monster
which
the
Heir
Slytherin
alone
can
control
said
Professor
Binns
his
dry
reedy
voice
The
class
exchanged
nervous
looks
tell
you
the
thing
does
not
exist
said
Professor
Binns
shuffling
his
notes
There
Chamber
and
monster
But
sir
said
Seamus
Finnigan
the
Chamber
can
only
opened
Slytherin
true
heir
one
else
would
able
find
would
they
Nonsense
Flaherty
said
Professor
Binns
aggravated
151
tone
long
succession
Hogwarts
headmasters
and
headmistresses
haven
found
the
thing
But
Professor
piped
Parvati
Patil
you
probably
have
use
Dark
Magic
open
Just
because
wizard
doesn
use
Dark
Magic
doesn
mean
can
Miss
Pennyfeather
snapped
Professor
Binns
repeat
the
likes
Dumbledore
But
maybe
you
got
related
Slytherin
Dumbledore
couldn
began
Dean
Thomas
but
Professor
Binns
had
had
enough
That
will
said
sharply
myth
does
not
exist
There
not
shred
evidence
that
Slytherin
ever
built
much
secret
broom
cupboard
regret
telling
you
such
foolish
story
will
return
you
please
history
solid
believable
verifiable
fact
And
within
five
minutes
the
class
had
sunk
back
into
its
usual
torpor
always
knew
Salazar
Slytherin
was
twisted
old
loony
Ron
told
Harry
and
Hermione
they
fought
their
way
through
the
teeming
corridors
the
end
the
lesson
drop
off
their
bags
before
dinner
But
never
knew
started
all
this
pure
blood
stuff
wouldn
his
house
you
paid
Honestly
the
Sorting
Hat
had
tried
put
Slytherin
got
the
train
straight
back
home
Hermione
nodded
fervently
but
Harry
didn
say
anything
His
stomach
had
just
dropped
unpleasantly
Harry
had
never
told
Ron
and
Hermione
that
the
Sorting
Hat
152
had
seriously
considered
putting
him
Slytherin
could
remember
though
were
yesterday
the
small
voice
that
had
spoken
his
ear
when
placed
the
hat
his
head
year
before
You
could
great
you
know
all
here
your
head
and
Slytherin
would
help
you
the
way
greatness
doubt
about
that
But
Harry
who
had
already
heard
Slytherin
House
reputa
tion
for
turning
out
Dark
wizards
had
thought
desperately
Not
Slytherin
and
the
hat
had
said
well
you
sure
better
Gryffindor
they
were
shunted
along
the
throng
Colin
Creevy
went
past
Hiya
Harry
Hullo
Colin
said
Harry
automatically
Harry
Harry
boy
class
has
been
saying
you
But
Colin
was
small
couldn
fight
against
the
tide
people
bearing
him
toward
the
Great
Hall
they
heard
him
squeak
See
you
Harry
and
was
gone
What
boy
his
class
saying
about
you
Hermione
wondered
That
Slytherin
heir
expect
said
Harry
his
stomach
dropping
another
inch
suddenly
remembered
the
way
Justin
Finch
Fletchley
had
run
away
from
him
lunchtime
People
here
believe
anything
said
Ron
disgust
The
crowd
thinned
and
they
were
able
climb
the
next
staircase
without
difficulty
you
really
think
there
Chamber
Secrets
Ron
asked
Hermione
don
know
she
said
frowning
Dumbledore
couldn
cure
Mrs
Norris
and
that
makes
think
that
whatever
attacked
her
might
not
well
human
she
spoke
they
turned
corner
and
found
themselves
the
end
the
very
corridor
where
the
attack
had
happened
They
stopped
and
looked
The
scene
was
just
had
been
that
night
except
that
there
was
stiff
cat
hanging
from
the
torch
bracket
and
empty
chair
stood
against
the
wall
bearing
the
message
The
Chamber
Secrets
has
been
Opened
That
where
Filch
has
been
keeping
guard
Ron
muttered
They
looked
each
other
The
corridor
was
deserted
Can
hurt
have
poke
around
said
Harry
dropping
his
bag
and
getting
his
hands
and
knees
that
could
crawl
along
searching
for
clues
Scorch
marks
said
Here
and
here
Come
and
look
this
said
Hermione
This
funny
Harry
got
and
crossed
the
window
next
the
message
the
wall
Hermione
was
pointing
the
topmost
pane
where
around
twenty
spiders
were
scuttling
apparently
fighting
get
through
small
crack
long
silvery
thread
was
dangling
like
rope
though
they
had
all
climbed
their
hurry
get
outside
Have
you
ever
seen
spiders
act
like
that
said
Hermione
wonderingly
said
Harry
have
you
Ron
Ron
looked
over
his
shoulder
Ron
was
standing
well
back
and
seemed
fighting
the
impulse
run
What
said
Harry
don
like
spiders
said
Ron
tensely
never
knew
that
said
Hermione
looking
Ron
surprise
You
used
spiders
Potions
loads
times
154
don
mind
them
dead
said
Ron
who
was
carefully
looking
anywhere
but
the
window
just
don
like
the
way
they
move
Hermione
giggled
not
funny
said
Ron
fiercely
you
must
know
when
was
three
Fred
turned
teddy
bear
into
great
big
fiIthy
spider
because
broke
his
toy
broomstick
You
wouldn
like
them
either
you
been
holding
your
bear
and
suddenly
had
too
many
legs
and
broke
off
shuddering
Hermione
was
obviously
still
trying
not
laugh
Feeling
they
had
better
get
off
the
subject
Harry
said
Remember
all
that
water
the
floor
Where
did
that
come
from
Someone
mopped
was
about
here
said
Ron
recovering
himself
walk
few
paces
past
Filch
chair
and
pointing
Level
with
this
door
reached
for
the
brass
doorknob
but
suddenly
withdrew
his
hand
though
been
burned
What
the
matter
said
Harry
Can
there
said
Ron
gruffly
That
girls
toilet
Ron
there
won
anyone
there
said
Hermione
standing
and
coming
over
That
Moaning
Myrtle
place
Come
let
have
look
And
ignoring
the
large
OUT
ORDER
sign
she
opened
the
door
was
the
gloomiest
most
depressing
bathroom
Harry
had
ever
set
foot
Under
large
cracked
and
spotted
mirror
were
row
chipped
sinks
The
floor
was
damp
and
reflected
the
dull
light
given
off
the
stubs
few
candles
burning
low
their
holders
the
wooden
doors
the
stalls
were
flaking
and
scratched
and
one
them
was
dangling
off
its
hinges
Hermione
put
her
fingers
her
lips
and
set
off
toward
the
end
stall
When
she
reached
she
said
Hello
Myrtle
how
are
you
Harry
and
Ron
went
look
Moaning
Myrtle
was
floating
above
the
tank
the
toilet
picking
spot
her
chin
This
girls
bathroom
she
said
eyeing
Ron
and
Harry
suspiciously
They
not
girls
Hermione
agreed
just
wanted
show
them
how
nice
here
She
waved
vaguely
the
dirty
old
mirror
and
the
damp
floor
Ask
her
she
saw
anything
Harry
mouthed
Hermione
What
are
you
whispering
said
Myrtle
staring
him
Nothing
said
Harry
quickly
wanted
ask
wish
people
would
stop
talking
behind
back
said
Myrtle
voice
choked
with
tears
have
feelings
you
know
even
dead
Myrtle
one
wants
upset
you
said
Hermione
Harry
only
one
wants
upset
That
good
one
howled
Myrtle
life
was
nothing
but
misery
this
place
and
now
people
come
along
ruining
death
wanted
ask
you
you
seen
anything
funny
lately
said
Hermione
quickly
Because
cat
was
attacked
right
outside
your
front
door
Halloween
Did
you
see
anyone
near
here
that
night
said
Harry
wasn
paying
attention
said
Myrtle
dramatically
Peeves
upset
much
came
here
and
tried
kill
myself
Then
course
remembered
that
that
Already
dead
said
Ron
helpfully
Myrtle
gave
tragic
sob
rose
the
air
turned
over
and
dived
headfirst
into
the
toilet
splashing
water
all
over
them
and
vanishing
from
sight
although
from
the
direction
her
muffled
sobs
she
had
come
rest
somewhere
the
bend
Harry
and
Ron
stood
with
their
mouths
open
but
Hermione
shrugged
wearily
and
said
Honestly
that
was
almost
cheerful
for
Myrtle
Come
let
Harry
had
barely
closed
the
door
Myrtle
gurgling
sobs
when
loud
voice
made
all
three
them
jump
RON
Percy
Weasley
had
stopped
dead
the
head
the
stairs
prefect
badge
agleam
expression
complete
shock
his
face
That
girls
bathroom
gasped
What

Just
having
look
around
Ron
shrugged
Clues

Percy
swelled
manner
that
reminded
Harry
forcefully
Mrs
Weasley
Get

from
there
Perry
said
striding

along
flapping
his

Don

Coming

Ron
hotly
stopping
short
and
glaring
Percy
Listen

That

Percy
fiercely
but
she

out
you
might
think
her
all
the

business
You

Ginny
said
Ron
whose
ears

157
reddening
You

Head

Percy

And

Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
chose
seats
far
possible
from
Percy
the
common
room
that
night
Ron
was
still
very
bad
temper
and
kept
blotting
his
Charms

When

Fuming

Hermione

Heir

Hermione
skeptically
Look

said
Harry
closing
his
books
too
The
whole
lot
them
have
been
Slytherin
always
boasting
about
They
could
easily
Slytherin
descendants
His
father
definitely
evil
enough
158
They

centuries
said
Ron
Handing
down
father

Well
said
Hermione
cautiously
suppose
possible
But
how
prove
said
Harry
darkly
There

said
Hermione
slowly
dropping
her
voice
still
further
with
quick
glance
across
the
room
Percy

And
dangerous
very
dangerous
breaking

like

said
Ron
irritably
All
right
said
Hermione
coldly
What
need
get
inside
the
Slytherin
common
room
and
ask
Malfoy
few
questions
without
him
realizing
But
that
impossible
Harry
said
Ron
laughed
not

Hermione
All

some
Polyjuice
Potion
What
that
said
Ron
and
Harry
together
Snape
mentioned
class
few
weeks
ago
you
think
got
nothing
better
Potions
than

Snape
muttered
Ron
transforms
you
into
somebody
else
Think
about
could
change
into
three
the
Slytherins
one
would
know
was
Malfoy
would
probably
tell
anything
probably
boasting
about
the
Slytherin
common
room
right
now
only
could
hear
him
This
Polyjuice
stuff
sounds
bit
dodgy
said
Ron
frowning
What
were
stuck
looking
like
three
the
Slytherins
forever
wears
off
after
while
said
Hermione
waving
her
hand
159
impatiently
But
getting
hold
the
recipe
will
very
difficult
Snape
said
was
book
called
Moste
Potente
Potions

There

only
one
way

Ron

Hermione
that

Ron
They

THE
ROGUE
BLUDGER
ince
the
disastrous
episode
the
pixies
Professor
Lockhart
had
not
brought

Instead
read
passages
from
his
books
them
and
sometimes
reenacted
some
the
more
dramatic
bits
usually
picked
Harry
help
him
with
these
reconstructions
far
Harry
had
been
forced
play
simple
Transylvanian
villager
whom
Lockhart
had
cured
Babbling
Curse
yeti
with
head
cold
and
vampire
who
had
been
unable

anything
except
lettuce
since
Lockhart
had
dealt
with
him
Harry
was
hauled

during
their

next
Defense
Against

this
time
acting
werewolf
hadn
had
very
good
reason
for
keeping
Lockhart
good
mood
would
have
refused
Nice

Harry
exactly
and
then
you

pounced
like
this
slammed
him

floor
thus
with
one
hand
managed
hold
him
down
with
other
161
put

then
screwed
remaining

and
performed
the
immensely
complex
Homorphus
Charm
let
out
piteous
moan
Harry
higher
than
that
good
the
fur
vanished
the
fangs
shrank
and
turned
back
into
man
Simple
yet
effective
and
another
village
will
remember
forever
the
hero
who
delivered
them
from
the
monthly
terror
werewolf
attacks
The
bell
rang
and
Lockhart
got
his
feet
Homework

Magical

The

Harry
returned

back
the
room
where
Ron
and
Hermione
were
waiting
Ready
Harry
muttered
Wait
till
everyone

said
Hermione
nervously
All
right
She
approached
Lockhart
desk
piece
paper
clutched
tightly
her
hand
Harry
and
Ron
right
behind
her
Professor
Lockhart
Hermione
stammered
wanted
get
this
book
out

library
Just
for
background
reading
She
held
out
the
piece
paper
her
hand
shaking
slightly
But
the
thing
the
Restricted

the

need
teacher

for
sure
would
help
understand
what
you
say
Gadding

Ghouls
about

Gadding

said
Lockhart
taking
the
note
from
Hermione
and
smiling
widely
her
Possibly
very
favorite
book
You
enjoyed
162
yes
said
Hermione
eagerly
clever
the
way
you
trapped
that
last
one
with
the
tea
strainer
Well
sure
one
will
mind
giving
the
best
student
the
year
little
extra
help
said
Lockhart
warmly
and
pulled
out
enormous
peacock
quill
Yes

said
misreading
the
revolted
look
Ron
face
usually
save
for
book
signings
scrawled
enormous
loopy
signature
the
note
and
handed
back
Hermione
Harry
said
Lockhart
while
Hermione
folded
the
note
with
fumbling
fingers
and
slipped
into
her
bag
Tomorrow

Still

private
training

hesitate
ask
Always
happy

Harry
made
indistinct
noise
his
throat
and
then
hurried
off
after
Ron
and
Hermione
don
believe
said
the
three
them
examined
the
signature
the
note
didn
even
look
the
book
wanted
That
because
brainless
git
said
Ron
But
who
cares
got
what
needed
not
brainless
git
said
Hermione
shrilly
they
half
ran
toward
the
library
Just
because
said
you
were
the
best
student
the
year
They
dropped
their
voices
they
entered
the
muffled
stillness
the
library
Madam
Pince
the
librarian
was
thin
irritable
woman
who
looked
like
underfed
vulture
163
Moste
Potente
Potions
she
repeated
suspiciously
trying
take
the
note
from
Hermione
but
Hermione
wouldn
let
was
wondering
could
keep
she
said
breathlessly
come
said
Ron
wrenching
from
her
grasp
and
thrusting
Madam
Pince
get
you
another
autograph
Lockhart
sign
anything
stands
still
long
enough
Madam
Pince
held
the
note
the
light
though
determined
detect
forgery
but
passed
the
test
She
stalked
away
between
the
lofty
shelves
and
returned
several
minutes
later
carrying
large
and
moldy
looking
book
Hermione
put
carefully
into
her
bag
and
they
left
trying
not
walk
too
quickly
look
too
guilty
Five
minutes
later
they
were
barricaded
Moaning
Myrtle
out
order
bathroom
once
again
Hermione
had
overridden
Ron
objections
pointing
out
that
was
the
last
place
anyone
their
right
minds
would
they
were
guaranteed
some
privacy
Moaning
Myrtle
was
crying
noisily
her
stall
but
they
were
ignoring
her
and
she
them
Hermione
opened
Moste
Potente
Potions
carefully
and
the
three
them
bent
over
the
damp
spotted
pages
was
clear
from
glance
why
belonged
the
Restricted
Section
Some
the
potions
had
effects
almost
too
gruesome
think
about
and
there
were
some
very
unpleasant
illustrations
which
included
man
who
seemed
have
been
turned
inside
out
and
witch
sprouting
several
extra
pairs
arms
out
her
head
Here
said
Hermione
excitedly
she
found
the
page
headed
The
Polyjuice
Potion
was
decorated
with
drawings
people
halfway
through
transforming
into
other
people
Harry
sin
164
cerely
hoped
the
artist
had
imagined
the
looks
intense
pain
their
faces
This
the
most
complicated
potion
ever
seen
said
Hermione
they
scanned
the
recipe
Lacewing
flies
leeches
fluxweed
and
knotgrass
she
murmured
running
her
finger
down
the
list
ingredients
Well

the
student
store
cupboard
can
help
ourselves
Oooh

and

said
Ron
sharply
What

Crabbe
toenails
Hermione
continued
though
she
hadn
heard
him
don
have
worry
about
that
yet
though
because
add
those
bits
last
Ron
turned
speechless
Harry
who

Hermione
Shredded

Hermione
shut
the
book
with
snap
Well

she
said
There
were
bright
pink
patches
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
were
brighter
than
usual
don
want
break

you
know

threatening
Muggle

far
worse
than

potion
But

Madam
Pince

165

said
Ron
All
right
But
not

How
long
will
take
make
anyway
said
Harry
Hermione
looking
happier
opened
the
book
again
Well
since
the
fluxweed

got
picked
the
full
moon
and
the
lacewings

got
stewed

one
days

the
ingredients
month
said
Ron
Malfoy
could
have
attacked
half
the
Muggle
borns
the
school
then
But
Hermione
eyes
narrowed
dangerously
again
and
added
swiftly
But
the
best
plan
got
full
steam
ahead
say
However
while
Hermione
was
checking
that
the
coast
was
clear
for
them
leave
the
bathroom
Ron
muttered
Harry
lot
less
hassle
you
can
just
knock
Malfoy
off
his
broom
tomorrow
Harry
woke
early
Saturday
morning
and
lay
for
while
thinking
about
the
coming
Quidditch
match
was
nervous
mainly
the
thought
what
Wood
would
say
Gryffindor
lost
but
also
the
idea
facing
team
mounted
the
fastest
racing
brooms
gold
could
buy
had
never
wanted
beat
Slytherin
badly
After
half
hour
lying
there
with
his
insides
churning
got
dressed
and
went
down
breakfast
early
where
found
the
rest
the
Gryffindor
team
huddled
the
long
empty
table
all
looking
uptight
and
not
speaking
much
eleven
clock
approached
the
whole
school
started
make
its
way
down
the
Quidditch
stadium

muggy

166
with
hint
thunder
the
air
Ron
and
Hermione
came
hurrying
over
wish
Harry
good
luck
entered
the
locker
rooms
The
team
pulled
their
scarlet
Gryffindor
robes
then
sat
down
listen
Wood

pre
match
pep
talk
Slytherin

point
denying
But

Too

muttered
George
Weasley

August
and

them
rue
the
day
they
let
that
little
bit
slime
Malfoy
buy
his
way
onto
their
team
Chest
heaving
with
emotion
Wood
turned
Harry
down

Harry

father
Get

Harry
said
Fred
winking
him
they
walked
out
onto
the
pitch
roar
noise
greeted
them
mainly
cheers
because
Ravenclaw
and
Hufflepuff
were
anxious
see
Slytherin
beaten
but
the
Slytherins
the
crowd
made
their
boos
and
hisses
heard
too
Madam
Hooch
the
Quidditch
teacher
asked
Flint
and
Wood
shake
hands
which
they
did
giving
each
other
threatening
stares
and
gripping
rather
harder
than
was
necessary
whistle

Madam
Hooch
Three

one
With
roar
from
the
crowd
speed
them
upward
the
fourteen
players
rose
toward
the
leaden
sky
Harry
flew
higher
than
any
them
squinting
around
for
the
Snitch
167
All
right
there
Scarhead
yelled
Malfoy
shooting
underneath
him
though
show
off
the
speed
his
broom
Harry
had
time
reply
that
very
moment
heavy
black
Bludger
came
pelting
toward
him
avoided
narrowly
that
felt
ruffle
his
hair
passed
Close
one
Harry
said
George
streaking
past
him
with
his
club
his
hand
ready
knock
the
Bludger
back
toward
Slytherin
Harry
saw
George
give
the
Bludger
powerful
whack
the
direction
Adrian
Pucey
but
the
Bludger
changed
direction
midair
and
shot
straight
for
Harry
again
Harry
dropped
quickly
avoid
and
George
managed
hit
hard
toward
Malfoy
Once
again
the
Bludger
swerved
like
boomerang
and
shot
Harry
head
Harry
put
burst
speed
and
zoomed
toward
the
other
end
the
pitch
could
hear
the
Bludger
whistling
along
behind
him
What
was
going
Bludgers
never
concentrated
one
player
like
this
was
their
job
try
and
unseat
many
people
possible
Fred
Weasley
was
waiting
for
the
Bludger
the
other
end
Harry
ducked
Fred
swung
the
Bludger
with
all
his
might
the
Bludger
was
knocked
off
course
Gotcha
Fred
yelled
happily
but
was
wrong
though
was
magnetically
attracted
Harry
the
Bludger
pelted
after
him
once
more
and
Harry
was
forced
fly
off
full
speed
had
started
rain
Harry
felt
heavy
drops
fall
onto
his
face
splattering
onto
his
glasses
didn
have
clue
what
was
going
the
rest
the
game
until
heard
Lee
Jordan
who
was
commentating
say
Slytherin

sixty
points

The
Slytherins
superior
brooms
were
clearly
doing
their
jobs
and
meanwhile
the
mad
Bludger
was
doing
all
could
knock
Harry
out
the
air
Fred
and
George
were
now
flying
close
him
either
side
that
Harry
could
see
nothing
all
except
their
flailing
arms
and
had
chance
look
for
the
Snitch
let
alone

Someone
tampered
with

Bludger
Fred
grunted
swinging

said
George
trying

Wood
and
stop
the
Bludger
breaking
Harry
nose
the
same
time
Wood
had
obviously
got
the
message
Madam
Hooch
whistle
rang
out
and
Harry
Fred
and
George
dived
for
the
ground
still
trying
avoid
the
mad
Bludger
What

Wood
the
Gryffindor

huddled
together
while

angrily

But

said
Wood
anxiously
Madam
Hooch
was
walking
toward
them
Over
her
shoulder
Harry
could
see
the
Slytherin
team
jeering
and
pointing
his
direction

him
Higher

Harry
climbed
looped
and
swooped
spiraled
zigzagged
and
rolled
Slightly
dizzy
nevertheless
kept
his
eyes
wide
open
rain

speckling
his
glasses
and
ran
his
nostrils
hung
upside
down
avoiding
another
fierce
dive
from

hear
laughter
from
the
crowd

must
look
very
stupid
but
the
rogue
Bludger
was
heavy
and
couldn
change

quickly
Harry

kind
roller

around
the

the
Golden

hovering
inches
above

For

moment
Harry
hung

toward

looked
and
saw
the
Snitch
WHAM
had
stayed
still
second
too
long
The
Bludger
had
hit
him
last
smashed
into
his
elbow
and
Harry
felt
his
arm
break
Dimly
dazed
the
searing
pain
his
arm
slid
sideways
his
rain
drenched
broom
one
knee
still
crooked
over
his
right
arm
dangling
useless
his
side
the
Bludger
came
pelting
back
for
second

this
time

Harry
swerved
out
the
way
one
idea
firmly
lodged
his
numb
brain
get
Malfoy
Through
haze
rain
and
pain
dived
for
the
shimmering
sneering
face
below
him
and
saw
its
eyes
widen
with
fear
Malfoy
thought
Harry
was
attacking
him
What
the
gasped
careening
out
Harry
way
Harry
took
his
remaining
hand
off
his
broom
and
made
wild
snatch
felt
his
fingers
close
the
cold
Snitch
but
was
now
only

gripping
the
broom
with
his
legs
and
there
was
yell
from
the
crowd
below
headed
straight
for
the
ground
trying
hard
not
pass
out
With
splattering
thud
hit
the
mud
and
rolled
off
his
broom
His
arm
was
hanging
very
strange
angle
riddled
with
pain
heard
though
from
distance
good
deal
whistling
and
shouting
focused
the
Snitch
clutched
his
good
hand
Aha

And

turned
away
from
his
arm
but
his
worst
fears
were
realized
the
people
above
him
gasped
and
Colin
Creevey
began
clicking
away
madly
His
arm
didn
hurt
anymore
nor
did
feel
remotely
like

said
Lockhart
Yes
Well

Taking

breath
looked
down

right
side
What

again
Poking

Ron
The
door
the
hospital
wing
burst
open
that
moment
Filthy
and
soaking
wet
the
rest
the
Gryffindor
team
had
arrived

Harry
Unbelievable

Harry
said
George
just

Mar
cus
Flint
yelling
Malfoy
Something
about
having
the
Snitch
top
his
head
and
not
noticing
Malfoy
didn
seem
too
happy
They
had
brought
cakes
sweets
and
bottles
pumpkin
juice
they
gathered
around
Harry
bed
and
were
just
getting
started
what
promised
good
party
when
Madam
Pomfrey
came
storming
over
shouting
This
boy
needs

got
thirty
three
bones
regrow
Out
OUT
And
Harry
was
left
alone
with
nothing
distract
him
from
the
stabbing
pains
his
limp
arm
Hours
and
hours
later
Harry
woke
quite
suddenly
the
pitch
blackness
and
gave
small
yelp
pain
His
arm
now
felt
full
large
splinters
For
second
thought
that
was
what
had
woken
him
Then
with
thrill
horror
realized
that
someone
was
sponging
his
forehead
the
dark
Get
off
said
loudly
and
then
Dobby
The
house
elf
goggling
tennis
ball
eyes
were
peering
Harry
through
the
darkness
single
tear
was
running
down
his
long
pointed
nose
Harry
Potter
came
back
school
whispered
miserably
Dobby
warned
and
warned
Harry
Potter
sir
why
didn
you
heed
Dobby
Why
didn
Harry
Potter
back
home
when
missed
the
train
Harry
heaved
himself
his
pillows
and
pushed
Dobby
sponge
away
What
you
doing
here
said
And
how
did
you
know
missed
the
train
Dobby
lip
trembled
and
Harry
was
seized
sudden
suspicion
was
you
said
slowly
You
stopped
the
barrier
from
letting
through
Indeed
yes
sir
said
Dobby
nodding
his
head
vigorously
ears
flapping
Dobby
hid
and
watched
for
Harry
Potter
and
sealed
the
gateway
and
Dobby
had
iron
his
hands
afterward
showed
Harry
ten
long
bandaged
fingers
but
Dobby
didn
care
sir
for
thought
Harry
Potter
was
safe
and
never
did
Dobby
dream
that
Harry
Potter
would
get
school
another
way
was
rocking
backward
and
forward
shaking
his
ugly
head
Dobby
was
shocked
when
heard
Harry
Potter
was
back
Hogwarts
let
his
master
dinner
burn
Such
flogging
Dobby
never
had
sir
176
Harry
slumped
back
onto
his
pillows
You
nearly
got
Ron
and
expelled
said
fiercely
You
better
get
lost
before
bones
come
back
Dobby
might
strangle
you
Dobby
smiled
weakly
Dobby
used
death
threats
sir
Dobby
gets
them
five
times
day
home
blew
his
nose
corner
the
filthy
pillowcase
wore
looking
pathetic
that
Harry
felt
his
anger
ebb
away
spite
himself
Why
you
wear
that
thing
Dobby
asked
curiously
This
sir
said
Dobby
plucking
the
pillowcase
Tis

Dobby
can
only

The

Dobby
even

sir
for
then
would
free
leave
their
house
forever
Dobby
mopped
his
bulging
eyes
and
said
suddenly
Harry
Potter
must
home
Dobby
thought
his
Bludger
would
enough
make
Your
Bludger
said
Harry
anger
rising
once
more
What
you
mean
your
Bludger
You
made
that
Bludger
try
and
kill
Not

you
sir
never

said
Dobby
shocked
Dobby
wants

Harry
Potter
life
Better
sent
home
grievously
injured
than
remain
here
sir
Dobby
only
wanted
Harry
Potter
hurt
enough
sent
home
that
all
said
Harry
angrily
don
suppose
you
going
tell
why
you
wanted

home
pieces
Harry
Potter
only
knew
Dobby
groaned
more
tears
dripping
onto
his
ragged
pillowcase
knew
what
means
177
the
lowly
the
enslaved
dregs
the
magical
world
Dobby
remembers
how
was
when
Who
Must
Not
Named
was
the
height
his
powers
sir
house
elfs
were
treated
like
vermin
sir
course
Dobby
still
treated
like
that
sir
admitted
drying
his
face
the
pillowcase
But
mostly
sir
life
has
improved
for
kind
since
you
triumphed
over
Who
Must
Not
Named
Harry
Potter
survived
and
the
Dark
Lord
power
was
broken
and
was
new
dawn
sir
and
Harry
Potter
shone
like
beacon
hope
for
those
who
thought
the
Dark
days
would
never
end
sit
And
now
Hogwarts
terrible
things
are
happen
are
perhaps
happening
already
and
Dobby
cannot
let
Harry
Potter
stay
here
now
that
history
repeat
itself
now
that
the
Chamber
Secrets

Dobby
froze
horrorstruck
then
grabbed
Harry
water
jug
from
his
bedside
table
and
cracked
over
his
own
head
toppling
out

Seeing

Quidditch
match
took
out
Colin
There
something
else
said
Harry
watching
Hermione
tearing
bundles
knotgrass
and
throwing
them
into
the
potion
Dobby
came
visit
the
middle
the
night
Ron
and
Hermione
looked
amazed
Harry
told
them
everything
Dobby
had
told
him
hadn
told
him
Hermione
and
Ron
listened
with
their
mouths
open
The
Chamber
Secrets
has
been
opened
before
Hermione
said
This
settles
said
Ron
triumphant
voice
Lucius
Malfoy
must
opened
the
Chamber
when
was
school
here
and
now
told
dear
old
Draco
how
obvious
Wish
Dobby
told
you
what
kind
monster

though
want
know
how
come
nobody

sneaking
around
the
school
Maybe

make
itself
invisible
said
Hermione
prodding
leeches
the
bottom
the
cauldron
maybe
can
disguise
itself
pretend
suit
armor
something
read
about
Chameleon
Ghouls
You

too
much
Hermione
said
Ron
pouring
dead
lacewings
top
the
leeches
crumpled
the
empty
lacewing
bag
and
looked
Harry
Dobby
stopped
from
getting
the

and
broke
your
arm
shook
his
head
You

The
news
that
Colin
Creevey
had
been
attacked
and
was
now
lying
though
dead
the
hospital
wing
had
spread
through
the
entire
school
Monday
morning
The
air
was
suddenly
thick
with
rumor
and
suspicion
The
first
years
were
now
moving
around
the
castle
tight
knit
groups
though
scared
they
would
attacked
they
ventured
forth
alone
Ginny
Weasley
who
sat
next
Colin
Creevey
Charms
was
distraught
but
Harry
felt
that
Fred
and
George
were
going
the
wrong
way
about
cheering
her
They
were
taking
turns
covering
themselves
with
fur
boils
and
jumping
out
her
from
behind
statues
They
only
stopped
when
Percy
apoplectic
with
rage
told
them
was
going
write
Mrs
Weasley
and
tell
her
Ginny
was
having
nightmares
Meanwhile
hidden
from
the
teachers
roaring
trade
talismans
amulets
and
other
protective
devices
was
sweeping
the
school
Neville
Longbottom
bought
large
evil
smelling
green
onion
pointed
purple
crystal
and
rotting
newt
tail
before
the
other
Gryffindor
boys
pointed
out
that
was
danger
was
pure
blood
and
therefore
unlikely
attacked
They
went
for
Filch
first
Neville
said
his
round
face
fearful
And
everyone
knows
almost
Squib
the
second
week
December
Professor
McGonagall
came
around
usual
collecting
names
those
who
would
staying
school
for
Christmas
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
signed
her
list
they
had
heard
that
Malfoy
was
staying
which
struck
them
very
suspicious
The
holidays
would
the
perfect
time
use
the
Polyjuice
Potion
and
try
worm
confession
out
him
Unfortunately
the
potion
was
only
half
finished
They
still
needed
the
bicorn
horn
and
the
boomslang
skin
and
the
only
place
they
were
going
get
them
was
from
Snape
private
stores
Harry
privately
felt
rather
face
Slytherin
legendary
monster
than
let
Snape
catch
him
robbing
his
office
What
need
said
Hermione
briskly
Thursday
afternoon
double
Potions
lesson
loomed
nearer
diversion
Then

can
sneak
into
Snape
office
and
take

Harry
and
Ron
looked
her
nervously
think
better
the
actual
stealing
Hermione
continued
matter
fact
tone
You
two
will
expelled
you
get
into
any
more
trouble
and
got
clean
record
all
you
need
cause
enough
mayhem

Snape
busy
for
five
minutes
Harry
smiled
feebly
Deliberately
causing
mayhem
Snape
Potions
class
was
about
safe
poking
sleeping
dragon
the
eye
Potions
lessons
took
place
one
the
large
dungeons
Thursday
afternoon
lesson
proceeded
the
usual
way
Twenty
cauldrons
stood
steaming
between
the
wooden
desks
which
stood
brass
scales
and
jars
ingredients
Snape
prowled
through
the
fumes
making
waspish
remarks
about
the
Gryffindors
work
while
the
Slytherins
sniggered
appreciatively
Draco
Malfoy
who
was
Snape
favorite
student
kept
flicking
puffer
fish
eyes
Ron
and
Harry
who
knew
that
they
retaliated
they
would
get
detention
faster
than
you
could
say
Unfair
Harry
Swelling
Solution
was
far
too
runny
but
had
his
mind
more
important

was
waiting
for
Hermione
signal
and
hardly
listened
Snape
paused
sneer
his
watery

potion
When
Snape
turned
and
walked
off
bully
Neville
Hermione
caught
Harry
eye
and
nodded
Harry
ducked
swiftly
down
behind
his
cauldron
pulled
one
Fred
Filibuster
fireworks
out
his
pocket
and
gave
quick
prod
with
his
wand
The
firework
began
fizz
and
sputter
Knowing
had
only
seconds
Harry
straightened
took
aim
and
lobbed
into
the
air
landed
right
target
Goyle
cauldron
Goyle
potion
exploded
showering
the
whole
class
People
shrieked
splashes
the
Swelling
Solution
hit
them
Malfoy
got
faceful
and
his
nose
began
swell
like
balloon
Goyle
blundered
around
his
hands
over
his
eyes
which
had
expanded
the
size
dinner
plate
Snape
was
trying
restore
calm
and
find
out
what
had
happened
Through
the
confusion
Harry
saw
Hermione
slip
quietly
into
Snape
office
Silence
SILENCE
Snape
roared
Anyone
who
has
been
splashed
come
here
for
Deflating
Draft
when
find
out
who
did
this
Harry
tried
not
laugh
watched
Malfoy
hurry
forward
his
head
drooping
with
the
weight
nose
like
small
melon
half
the
class
lumbered
Snape
desk
some
weighted
down
with
arms
like
clubs
others
unable
talk
through
gigantic
puffedup
lips
Harry
saw
Hermione
slide
back
into
the
dungeon
the
front
her
robes
bulging
When
everyone
had
taken
swig
antidote
and
the
various
swellings
had
subsided
Snape
swept
over
Goyle
cauldron
and
scooped
out
the
twisted
black
remains
the
firework
There
was
sudden
hush
187
ever
find
out
who
threw
this
Snape
whispered
shall
make
sure
that
person
expelled
Harry
arranged
his
face
into
what
hoped
was
puzzled
expression
Snape
was
looking
right
him
and
the
bell
that
rang
ten
minutes
later
could
not
have
been
more
welcome
knew

told
Ron

Hermione
threw
the
new

into
the
cauldron
and
began
stir
feverishly
ready

weeks
she
said
happily

Ron
reassuringly
Harry
What

Knowing
Snape

said
Harry
the
potion
frothed
and
bubbled
week
later
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
walking
across
the
entrance
hall
when
they
saw
small
knot
people
gathered
around
the
notice
board
reading
piece
parchment
that
had
just
been
pinned
Seamus
Finnigan
and
Dean
Thomas
beckoned
them
over
looking
excited
They
starting
Dueling
Club
said
Seamus
First

What

said
Ron
but
too
read
the
sign
with
interest
Could
useful
said
Harry
and
Hermione
they
went
into
dinner
Shall
Harry
and
Hermione
were
all
for
eight
clock
that
188
evening
they
hurried
back
the
Great
Hall
The
long
dining
tables
had
vanished
and
golden
stage
had
appeared
along
one
wall
lit
thousands
candles
floating
overhead
The
ceiling
was
velvety
black
once
more
and
most
the
school
seemed
packed
beneath
all
carrying
their
wands
and
looking
excited
wonder
who
teaching
said
Hermione
they
edged
into
the
chattering
crowd
Someone
told
Flitwick
was
dueling
champion
when
was
young
maybe
him
long
not
Harry
began
but
ended
groan
Gilderoy
Lockhart
was
walking
onto
the
stage
resplendent
robes
deep
plum
and
accompanied
none
other
than
Snape
wearing
his
usual
black
Lockhart
waved
arm
for
silence
and
called
Gather

they
finished

off
Ron
muttered
Harry
ear
Snape
upper
lip
was
curling
Harry
wondered
why
Lockhart
189
was
still
smiling
Snape
had
been
looking
him
like
that
have
been
running
fast
could
the
opposite
direction
Lockhart
and
Snape
turned
face
each
other
and
bowed
least
Lockhart
did
with
much
twirling
his
hands
whereas
Snape
jerked
his
head
irritably
Then
they
raised
their
wands
like
swords
front
them
you
see
are
holding
our
wands
the
accepted
combative
position
Lockhart
told
the
silent
crowd
the
count

our
first
spells
Neither

wouldn
bet
that
Harry
murmured
watching
Snape
baring
his
teeth
One
two
three
Both
them
swung
their
wands
above
their
heads
and
pointed
them
their
opponent
Snape
cried
Expelliarmus
There
was
dazzling
flash
scarlet
light
and
Lockhart
was
blasted
off
his
feet
flew
backward
off
the
stage
smashed
into
the
wall
and
slid
down
sprawl
the
floor
Malfoy
and
some
the
other
Slytherins
cheered
Hermione
was
dancing
tiptoes
you
think
all
right
she
squealed
through
her
fingers
Who
cares
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
Lockhart
was
getting
unsteadily
his
feet
His
hat
had
fallen
off
and
his
wavy
hair
was
standing
end
Well

They
moved
through
the
crowd
matching
partners
Lockhart
teamed
Neville
with
Justin
Finch
Fletchley
but
Snape
reached
Harry
and
Ron

Time

Miss
Bulstrode
Malfoy
strutted
over
smirking
Behind
him
walked
Slytherin
girl
who
reminded
Harry
picture
seen
Holidays
with
Hags
She
was
large
and
square
and
her
heavy
jaw
jutted
aggressively
Hermione
gave
her
weak
smile
that
she
did
not
return
Face

partners
called
Lockhart
back
the
platform
And
bow
Harry
and
Malfoy
barely
inclined

Harry
swung
his
wand

but
Malfoy
had
already
started

His

Harry
hard
felt
though
been
hit
over
the
head
with

stumbled
but
everything
still
seemed
working
and
wasting
more
time
Harry
pointed
his
wand
straight
Malfoy
and
shouted

Malfoy
the

Lockhart
shouted

over

the
battling
crowd
Malfoy
sank
his
knees
Harry
had
hit
him
with
Tickling
Charm
and
could
barely
move
for
laughing
Harry
hung
back
with
vague
feeling
would
unsporting
bewitch
Malfoy
while
was

this
was

gasping
for

Lockhart
but
Snape
took
charge

shouted
Harry
feet
stopped
dancing
Malfoy
stopped
laughing
and
they
were
able
look
haze
greenish
smoke
was
hovering
over
the
scene
Both
Neville
and
Justin
were
lying
the
floor
panting
Ron
was
holding
ashen

Seamus
apologizing
for
whatever
his
broken
wand
had
done
but
Hermione
and
Millicent
Bulstrode
were
still
moving
Millicent
had
Hermione
headlock
and
Hermione
was
whimpering
pain
both
their
wands
lay
forgotten
the
floor
Harry
leapt
forward
and
pulled
Millicent
off
was
difficult
She
was
lot
bigger
than
was
Dear

Lockhart
standing
flustered
the
midst
the
hall
glanced
Snape
whose
black
eyes
glinted
and
looked
quickly
away
Let
have
volunteer
pair
Longbottom
and
Finch
Fletchley
how
about
you

Professor
Lockhart
said
Snape
gliding
over
like

devastation
with
the

spells
sending
what

Neville

How

Snape
with
twisted
smile
Excellent
idea
said
Lockhart
gesturing
Harry
and
Malfoy
into
the
middle
the
hall
the
crowd
backed
away
give
them
room
Now
Harry
said
Lockhart
When
Draco
points
his
wand
you

this
raised
his
own
wand
attempted
complicated
sort
wiggling
action
and
dropped
Snape
smirked
Lockhart
quickly
picked
saying
Whoops

little
overexcited
Snape
moved
closer
Malfoy
bent
down
and
whispered
something
his
ear
Malfoy
smirked
too
Harry
looked
nervously
Lockhart
and
said
Professor
could
you
show
that
blocking
thing
again
Scared
muttered
Malfoy
that
Lockhart
couldn
hear
him
You
wish
said
Harry
out
the
corner
his
mouth
Lockhart
cuffed
Harry
merrily
the
shoulder
Just
what
did
Harry
What
drop
wand
But
Lockhart
wasn
listening
Three
two
one
shouted
Malfoy
raised
his
wand
quickly
and
bellowed
Serpensortia
The
end
his
wand
exploded
Harry
watched
aghast
long
black
snake
shot
out
fell
heavily
onto
the
floor
between
them
and
raised
itself
ready
strike
There
were
screams
the
crowd
backed
swiftly
away
clearing
the
floor
Don
move
Potter
said
Snape
lazily
clearly
enjoying
the
sight
Harry
standing
motionless
eye
eye
with
the
angry
snake
get
rid
Allow
shouted
Lockhart
brandished
his
wand
the
snake
and
there
was
loud
bang
the
snake
instead
vanishing
flew
ten
feet
into
the
air
and
fell
back
the
floor
with
loud
smack
Enraged
hissing
furiously
slithered
straight
toward
Justin
Finch
Fletchley
and
raised
itself
again
fangs
exposed
poised
strike
Harry
wasn
sure
what
made
him
wasn
even
aware
deciding
All
knew
was
that
his
legs
were
carrying
him
forward
though
was
casters
and
that
had
shouted
stupidly
the
snake
Leave
him
alone
And
miraculously
inexplicably
the
snake
slumped
the
floor
docile
thick
black
garden
hose
its
eyes
now
Harry
Harry
felt
the
fear
drain
out
him
knew
the
snake
wouldn
attack
anyone
now
though
how
knew
couldn
have
explained
looked
Justin
grinning
expecting
see
Justin
looking
194
relieved
puzzled
even
grateful
but
certainly
not
angry
and
scared
What
you
think
you
playing
shouted
and
before
Harry
could
say
anything
Justin
had
turned
and
stormed
out
the
hall
Snape
stepped
forward
waved
his
wand
and
the
snake
vanished
small
puff
black
smoke
Snape
too
was
looking
Harry
unexpected
way
was
shrewd
and
calculating
look
and
Harry
didn
like
was
also
dimly
aware
ominous
muttering
all
around
the
walls
Then
felt
tugging
the
back
his
robes
Come
said
Rods
voice
his
ear
Move

Ron
steered
him
out
the
hall
Hermione
hurrying
alongside
them
they
went
through
the
doors
the
people
either
side
drew
away
though
they
were
frightened
catching
something
Harry
didn
have
clue
what
was
going
and
neither
Ron
nor
Hermione
explained
anything
until
they
had
dragged
him
all
the
way
the
empty
Gryffindor
common
room
Then
Ron
pushed
Harry
into
armchair
and
said
You
Parselmouth
Why
didn
you
tell
what
said
Harry
Parselmouth
said
Ron

Ron

with
everyone

Harry
gaped
him
spoke
different
language
But
didn
realize
how
can
speak
language

Ron
shook
his
head
Both
and
Hermione
were
looking
though
someone
had
died
Harry
couldn

what
was
terrible

what
wrong
with

What

Hunt

Hermione
speaking
last
hushed
voice
because
being
able
talk

was
what

was
famous
for

Harry
lay
awake
for
hours
that
night
Through
gap
the
curtains
around
his
four
poster
watched
snow
starting
drift
past
the
tower
window
and
wondered
Could
descendant
Salazar
Slithering
didn
know
anything
about
his
father
family
after
all
The
Dursleys
had
always
forbidden
questions
about
his
wizarding
relatives
Quietly
Harry
tried
say
something
Parseltongue
The
words
wouldn
come
seemed
had
face
face
with
snake
But
Gryffindor
Harry
thought
The
Sorting
Hat
wouldn
have
put
here
had
Slytherin
blood
said
nasty
little
voice
his
brain
but
the
Sorting
Hat
wanted
put
you

don
you
remember
Harry
turned
over
see
Justin
the
next
day
Herbology
and
explain
that
been
calling
the
snake
off
not
egging
which
thought
angrily
pummeling
his
pillow
any
fool
should
have
realized
next
morning
however
the
snow
that
had
begun
the
night
had
turned
into
blizzard
thick
that
the
last
Herbology
lesson
the
term
was
canceled
Professor
Sprout
wanted
fit
socks
and
scarves
the
Mandrakes
tricky
operation
she
would
entrust

quickly
and

Mrs
Norris
and
Colin
Creevey
Harry
fretted
about
this
next
the
fire
the
Gryffindor
common
room
while
Ron
and
Hermione
used
their
time
off

chess
For

you
Harry
got
and
left
through
the
portrait
hole
wondering
where
Justin
might
The
castle
was
darker
than
usually
was
daytime
because
the
thick
swirling
gray
snow
every
window
Shivering
Harry
walked
past
classrooms
where
lessons
were
taking
place
catching
snatches
what
was
happening
within
Professor
McGonagall
was
shouting
someone
who
the
sound
had
turned
his
friend
into
badger
Resisting
the
urge
take
look
Harry
walked
thinking
that
Justin
might
using
his
free
time
catch
some
work
and
deciding
check
the
library
first
group
the
Hufliepuffs
who
should
have
been
Herbology
were
indeed
sitting
the
back
the
library
but
they
didn
seem
working
Between
the
long
lines
high
bookshelves
Harry
could
see
that
their
heads
were
close
together
and
they
were
having
what
looked
like
absorbing
conversation
couldn
see
whether
Justin
was
among
them
was
walking
toward
them
when
something
what
they
were
saying
met
his
ears
and
paused
listen
hidden
the
Invisibility
section
anyway
stout
boy
was
saying
told
Justin

Justin
been
waiting
for
something
like
this

ever
since
let

Potter
was
Muggle
born
Justin
actually
told
him
been
down
for
Eton
That
not
the
kind
thing
you
bandy
about
with
Slytherin
heir
the
loose
You

Potter
then
Ernie

with

pigtails
anxiously

Hannah
said
the
stout
boy
solemnly
Parselmouth
Everyone
knows
that
the
mark
Dark
wizard
Have
you
ever
heard
decent
one
who
could
talk
snakes
They
called
Slytherin
himself
Serpent
tongue
There
was
some
heavy
murmuring
this
and
Ernie
went
Remember
what
was
written
the
wall
Enemies
the
Heir
Beware
Potter
had
some
sort
run
with
Filch
Next
thing

Flich

That

You

Ernie
lowered
his
voice
mysteriously
the
Hufflepuffs
bent
closer
and
Harry
edged
nearer
that
could
catch
Ernie
words
one
knows
how
survived
that
attack
You
Know
Who
mean
say
was
only
baby
when

have
been
blasted
into
smithereens
Only
really
powerful
Dark
wizard
could
have
survived
curse
like
that
dropped
his
voice
until
was
barely
more
than
whisper
and
said
That
probably
why
You
Know
Who
wanted
kill
him
the
first
place
Didn
want
another
Dark
Lord
competing
with
him
wonder
what
other
powers

hiding
Harry
couldn
take
anymore
Clearing
his
throat
loudly
stepped
out
from
behind
the
bookshelves

been
feeling
angry

have
found
the
sight
that
greeted
him
funny
Every
one

Hufflepuffs
looked
though
they
had
been
Petrified
the
sight
him
and
the
color
was
draining
out

Harry

for
Justin
Finch
Fletchley
The
Hufepuffs
worst
fears
had
clearly
been
confirmed
They
all
looked
fearfully
Ernie
What

Ernie

him
what
really

Harry
Ernie
bit
his
white
lips
and

taking
deep
breath
said

Then

that

Harry
All

Ernie
stubbornly
though

trembling

Parseltongue

Harry
said
his
voice
shaking
with
anger

even
touch
him

very
near

Ernie
And

generations

Ernie

Harry

his
heel
and
stormed
out
the
library
earning
himself
reproving
glare
from
Madam
Pince
who
was
polishing

gilded
cover
large
spellbook
200
Harry
blundered
the
corridor
barely
noticing
where
was
going
was
such
fury
The
result
was
that
walked
into
something
very
large
and
solid
which
knocked
him
backward
onto
the
floor
hello
Hagrid
Harry
said
looking
Hagrid
face
was
entirely
hidden
woolly
snow
covered
balaclava
but
couldn
possibly
anyone

filled
most
the
corridor
his
moleskin

rooster
was
hanging
from

his
massive
gloved
hands
All

Yeh

Harry
couldn
bring
himself

what
Ernie
and
the
rest

Hufflepuffs
had
been
saying
about
him
nothing
said
better
get
going
Hagrid
Transfiguration
next
and
got
pick
books
walked
off
his
mind
still
full
what
Ernie
had
said
about
him
Justin
been
waiting
for
something
like
this
happen
ever
since
let
slip
Potter
was
Muggle
born
Harry
stamped
the
stairs
and
turned
along
another
corridor
which
was
particularly
dark
the
torches
had
been
extinguished
strong
icy
draft
that
was
blowing
through
loose
windowpane
was
halfway
down
the
passage
when
tripped
headlong
over
something
lying
the
floor
turned
squint
what
fallen
over
and
felt
though
his
stomach
had
dissolved
Justin
Finch
Fletchley
was
lying
the
floor
rigid
and
cold
look
shock
frozen
his
face
his
eyes
staring
blankly
the
ceiling
And
that
wasn
all
Next
him
was
another
figure
the
strangest
sight
Harry
had
ever
seen
was
Nearly
Headless
Nick
longer
pearly
white
and
transparent
but
black
and
smoky
floating
immobile
and
horizontal
six
inches
off
the
floor
His
head
was
half
off
and
his
face
wore
expression
shock
identical
Justin
Harry
got
his
feet
his
breathing
fast
and
shallow
his
heart
doing
kind
drumroll
against
his
ribs
looked
wildly
and
down
the
deserted
corridor
and
saw
line
spiders
scuttling
fast
they
could
away
from
the
bodies
The
only
sounds
were
the
muffled
voices
teachers
from
the
classes
either
side
could
run
and
one
would
ever
know
had
been
there
But
couldn
just
leave
them
lying
here
had
get
help
Would
anyone
believe
hadn
had
anything
with
this
stood
there
panicking
door
right
next
him
opened
with
bang
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
came
shooting
out
Why

wee

cackled
Peeves
knocking
Harry
glasses
askew
bounced
past
him
What

Why

202
Peeves
stopped
halfway
through
midair
somersault
Upside
down
spotted
Justin
and
Nearly
Headless
Nick
flipped
the
right
way
filled
his
lungs
and
before
Harry
could
stop
him
screamed
ATTACK

MORTAL
GHOST

RUN
FOR
YOUR
LIVES
ATTAAAACK
Crash
crash
crash
door
after
door
flew
open
along
the
corridor
and
people
flooded
out
For
several
long
minutes
there
was
scene
such
confusion
that
Justin
was
danger
being
squashed
and
people
kept
standing
Nearly
Headless
Nick
Harry
found
himself
pinned
against
the
wall
the
teachers
shouted
for
quiet
Professor
McGonagall
came
running
followed
her
own
class
one
whom
still
had
black
and
white
striped
hair
She
used
her
wand
set
off
aloud
bang
which
restored
silence
and
ordered
everyone
back
into
their
classes
sooner
had
the
scene
cleared
somewhat
than
Ernie
the
Hufflepuff
arrived
panting
the
scene
Caught
the
act
Ernie
yelled
his
face
stark
white
pointing
his
finger
dramatically
Harry
That
will
Macmillan
said
Professor
McGonagall
sharply
Peeves
was
bobbing
overhead
now
grinning
wickedly
surveying
the
scene
Peeves
always
loved
chaos
the
teachers
bent
over
Justin
and
Nearly
Headless
Nick
examining
them
Peeves
broke
into
song
Potter
you
rotter
what
have
you
done
You
killing
off
students
you
think
good
fun
That
enough
Peeves
barked
Professor
McGonagall
and
Peeves
zoomed
away
backward
with
his
tongue
out
Harry
203
Justin
was
carried
the
hospital
wing
Professor
Flitwick
and
Professor
Sinistra
the
Astronomy
department
but
nobody
seemed
know
what
for
Nearly
Headless
Nick
the
end
Professor
McGonagall
conjured
large
fan
out
thin
air
which
she
gave
Ernie
with
instructions
waft
Nearly
Headless
Nick
the
stairs
This
Ernie
did
fanning
Nick
along
like
silent
black
hovercraft
This
left
Harry
and
Professor
McGonagall
alone
together
This
way
Potter
she
said
Professor
said
Harry
once
swear
didn
This
out
hands
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
curtly
They
marched
silence
around
corner
and
she
stopped
before
large
and
extremely
ugly
stone
gargoyle
Lemon
drop
she
said
This
was
evidently
password
because
the
gargoyle
sprang
suddenly
life
and
hopped
aside
the
wall
behind
him
split
two
Even
full
dread
for
what
was
coming
Harry
couldn
fail
amazed
Behind
the
wall
was
spiral
staircase
that
was
moving
smoothly
upward
like
escalator
and
Professor
McGonagall
stepped
onto
Harry
heard
the
wall
thud
closed
behind
them
They
rose
upward
circles
higher
and
higher
until
last
slightly
dizzy
Harry
saw
gleaming
oak
door
ahead
with
brass
knocker
the
shape
griffin
knew
now
where
was
being
taken
This
must
where
Dumbledore
lived
204
THE
POLYJUICE
POTION
hey
stepped
off
the
stone
staircase
the
top
and
Professor
McGonagall
rapped
the
door
opened
silently
and
they
entered
Professor
McGonagall
told
Harry
wait
and
left
him
there
alone
Harry
looked
around
One
thing
was
certain
all
the
teachers
offices
Harry
had
visited
far
this
year
Dumbledore
was
far
the
most
interesting
hadn
been
scared
out
his
wits
that
was
about
thrown
out
school
would
have
been
very
pleased
have
chance
look
around
was
large
and
beautiful
circular
room
full
funny
little
noises
number
curious
silver
instruments
stood
spindlelegged
tables
whirring
and
emitting
little
puffs
smoke
The
walls
were
covered
with
portraits
old
headmasters
and
headmistresses
all
whom
were
snoozing
gently
their
frames
There
was
also
enormous
claw
footed
desk
and
sitting
shelf
behind
shabby
tattered
wizard
hat
the
Sorting
Hat
205
Harry
hesitated
cast
wary
eye
around
the
sleeping
witches
and
wizards
the
walls
Surely
couldn
hurt
took
the
hat
down
and
tried
again
Just
see
just
make
sure
had
put
him
the
right
House
walked
quietly
around
the
desk
lifted
the
hat
from
its
shelf
and
lowered
slowly
onto
his
head
was
much
too
large
and
slipped
down
over
his
eyes
just
had
done
the
last
time
put
Harry
stared
the
black
inside
the
hat
waiting
Then
small
voice
said
his
ear
Bee
your
bonnet
Harry
Potter
yes
Harry
muttered
sorry
bother
you
wanted
ask
You
been
wondering
whether
put
you
the
right
House
said
the
hat
smartly
Yes
you
were
particularly
difficult
place
But
stand
what
said
before
Harry
heart
leapt
you
would
have
done
well
Slytherin
Harry
stomach
plummeted
grabbed
the
point
the
hat
and
pulled
off
hung
limply
his
hand
grubby
and
faded
Harry
pushed
back
onto
its
shelf
feeling
sick
You
wrong
said
aloud
the
still
and
silent
hat
didn
move
Harry
backed
away
watching
Then
strange
gagging
noise
behind
him
made
him
wheel
around
wasn
alone
after
all
Standing
golden
perch
behind
the
door
was
decrepit
looking
bird
that
resembled
half
plucked
turkey
Harry
stared
and
the
bird
looked
balefully
back
making
its
gagging
noise
again
Harry
thought
looked
very
ill
Its
eyes
were
dull
and
even
Harry
watched
couple
more
feathers
fell
out
its
tail
Harry
was
just
thinking
that
all
needed
was
for
Dumbledore
pet
bird
die
while
was
alone
the
office
with
when
the
bird
burst
into
flames
Harry
yelled
shock
and
backed
away
into
the
desk
looked
feverishly
around
case
there
was
glass
water
somewhere
but
couldn
see
one
the
bird
meanwhile
had
become
fireball
gave
one
loud
shriek
and
next
second
there
was
nothing
but
smouldering
pile
ash
the
floor
The
office
door
opened
Dumbledore
came
looking
very
somber
Professor
Harry
gasped
Your
bird
couldn
anything
just
caught
fire
Harry
astonishment
Dumbledore
smiled
About
time

Harry
Phoenixes
burst
into
flame
when
time
for
them
die
and
are
reborn
from
the
ashes
Watch

Harry
looked
down
time
see
tiny
wrinkled
newborn
bird
poke
its
head
out
the
ashes
was
quite
ugly
the
old
one
shame
you
had
see
him
Burning

said
Dumbledore
seating
himself
behind
his
desk
really
very
handsome
most
the
time
wonderful
red
and
gold
plumage
Fascinating
creatures
phoenixes
They
can
carry
immensely
heavy
loads
their
tears
have
healing
powers
and
they
make
highly
faithful
pets
the
shock
Fawkes
catching
fire
Harry
had
forgotten
what
was
there
for
but
all
came
back
him
Dumbledore
settled
himself
the
high
chair
behind
the
desk
and
fixed
Harry
with
his
penetrating
light
blue
stare
Before
Dumbledore
could
speak
another
word
however
the
door
the
office
flew
open
with
almighty
bang
and
Hagrid
burst
wild
look
his
eyes
his
balaclava
perched
top
his
shaggy
black
head
and
the
dead
rooster
still
swinging
from
his
hand
wasn
Harry
Professor
Dumbledore
said
Hagrid
urgently
was
talkin
ter
him
seconds
before
that
kid
was
found
never
had
time

Dumbledore
tried
say
something
but
Hagrid
went
ranting
waving
the
rooster
around
his
agitation
sending
feathers
everywhere

front
the
Ministry
Magic

Dumbledore

Hagrid
the
rooster
falling
limply
his
side
Right

Headmaster
And
stomped
out
looking
embarrassed
You

Professor
Harry
repeated
hopefully
Dumbledore
brushed
rooster
feathers
off
his
desk
Harry

Dumbledore
though
his
face
was
somber
again
But
still

Harry
waited
nervously
while
Dumbledore
considered
him
the
tips
his
long
fingers

must
ask
you
Harry
whether
there
anything
you
like
tell
said
gently
Anything
all
Harry
didn
know
what
say
thought
Malfoy
shouting
You
next
Mudbloods
and
the
Polyjuice
Potion
simmering
away
Moaning
Myrtle
bathroom
Then
thought
the
disembodied
voice
had
heard
twice
and
remembered
what
Ron
had
said
Hearing
voices
one
else
can
hear
isn
good
sign
even
the
wizarding
world
thought
too
about
what
everyone
was
saying
about
him
and
his
growing
dread
that
was
somehow
connected
with
Salazar
Slytherin
said
Harry
There
isn
anything
Professor
The
double
attack
Justin
and
Nearly
Headless
Nick
turned
what
had
hitherto
been
nervousness
into
real
panic
Curiously
was
Nearly
Headless
Nick
fate
that
seemed
worry
people
most
What
could
possibly
that
ghost
people
asked
each
other
what
terrible
power
could
harm
someone
who
was
already
dead
There
was
almost
stampede
book
seats
the
Hogwarts
Express
that
students
could
home
for
Christmas
this
rate
the
only
ones
left
Ron
told
Harry
and
Hermione
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
What
jolly
holiday
going
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
always
did
whatever
Malfoy
did
had
signed
stay
over
the
holidays
too
But
Harry
was
glad
that
most
people
were
leaving
was
tired
people
skirting
around
him
the
corridors
though
was
about
sprout
fangs
spit
poison
tired
all
the
muttering
pointing
and
hissing
passed
209
Fred
and
George
however
found
all
this
very
funny
They
went
out
their
way
march
ahead
Harry
down
the
corridors
shouting
Make
way
for
the
Heir
Slytherin
seriously
evil
wizard
coming
through
Percy
was
deeply
disapproving
this
behavior
not
laughing
matter
said
coldly
get
out
the
way
Percy
said
Fred
Harry
hurry
Yeah
off
the
Chamber
Secrets
for
cup
tea
with
his
fanged
servant
said
George
chortling
Ginny
didn
find
amusing
either
don
she
wailed
every
time
Fred
asked
Harry
loudly
who
was
planning
attack
next
when
George
pretended
ward
Harry
off
with
large
clove
garlic
when
they
met
Harry
didn
mind
made
him
feel
better
that
Fred
and
George
least
thought
the
idea
his
being
Slytherin
heir
was
quite
ludicrous
But
their
antics
seemed
aggravating
Draco
Malfoy
who
looked
increasingly
sour
each
time
saw
them
because
bursting
say
really
him
said
Ron
knowingly
You
know
how
hates
anyone
beating
him
anything
and
you
getting
all
the
credit
for
his
dirty
work
Not
for
long
said
Hermione
satisfied
tone
The
Polyjuice
Potion
nearly
ready
getting
the
truth
out
him
any
day
now
last
the
term
ended
and
silence
deep
the
snow
the
grounds
descended
the
castle
Harry
found
peaceful
rather
than
gloomy
and
enjoyed
the
fact
that
Hermione
and
the
Weasleys
had
the
run
Gryffindor
Tower
which
meant
they
could
210
play
Exploding
Snap
loudly
without
bothering
anyone
and
practice
dueling
private
Fred
George
and
Ginny
had
chosen
stay
school
rather
than
visit
Bill
Egypt
with
and
Mrs
Weasley
Percy
who
disapproved
what
termed
their
childish
behavior
didn
spend
much
time
the
Gryffindor
common
room
had
already
told
them
pompously
that
was
only
staying
over
Christmas
because
was
his
duty
prefect
support
the
teachers
during
this
troubled
time
Christmas
morning
dawned
cold
and
white
Harry
and
Ron
the
only
ones
left
their
dormitory
were
woken
very
early
Hermione
who
burst
fully
dressed
and
carrying
presents
for
them
both
Wake
she
said
loudly
pulling
back
the
curtains
the
window
Hermione
you
not
supposed
here
said
Ron
shielding
his
eyes
against
the
light
Merry
Christmas
you
too
said
Hermione
throwing
him
his
present
been
for
nearly
hour
adding
more
lacewings
the
potion
ready
Harry
sat
suddenly
wide
awake
Are
you
sure
Positive
said
Hermione
shifting
Scabbers
the
rat
that
she
could
sit
down
the
end
Ron
four
poster
going
say
should
tonight
that
moment
Hedwig
swooped
into
the
room
carrying
very
small
package
her
beak
Hello
said
Harry
happily
she
landed
his
bed
Are
you
speaking
again
211
She
nibbled
his
ear
affectionate
sort
way
which
was
far
better
present
than
the
one
that
she
had
brought
him
which
turned
out
from
the
Dursleys
They
had
sent
Harry
toothpick
and
note
telling
him
find
out
whether
able
stay
Hogwarts
for
the
summer
vacation
too
The
rest
Harry
Christmas
presents
were
far
more
satisfactory
Hagrid
had
sent
him
large
tin
treacle
fudge
which
Harry
decided
soften
the
fire
before
eating
Ron
had
given
him
book
called
Flying
with
the
Cannons
book
interesting
facts
about
his
favorite
Quidditch
team
and
Hermione
had
bought
him
luxury
eagle
feather
quill
Harry
opened
the
last
present
find
new
hand
knitted
sweater
from
Mrs
Weasley
and
large
plum
cake
read
her
card
with
fresh
surge
guilt
thinking
about
Weasley
car
which
hadn
been
seen
since
its
crash
with
the
Whomping
Willow
and
the
bout
rule
breaking
and
Ron
were
planning
next
one
not
even
someone
dreading
taking
Polyjuice
Potion
later
could
fail
enjoy
Christmas
dinner
Hogwarts
The
Great
Hall
looked
magnificent
Not
only
were
there
dozen
frost
covered
Christmas
trees
and
thick
streamers
holly
and
mistletoe
crisscrossing
the
ceiling
but
enchanted
snow
was
falling
warm
and
dry
from
the
ceiling
Dumbledore
led
them
few
his
favorite
carols
Hagrid
booming
more
and
more
loudly
with
every
goblet
eggnog
consumed
Percy
who
hadn
noticed
that
Fred
had
bewitched
his
prefect
badge
that
now
read
Pinhead
kept
asking
them
all
what
they
were
sniggering
Harry
didn
even
care
that
Draco
Malfoy
was
making
loud
snide
remarks
about
his
new
sweater
from
the
Slytherin
table
With
bit
luck
Malfoy
would
getting
his
comeuppance
few
hours
time
Harry
and
Ron
had
barely
finished
their
third
helpings
Christmas
pudding
when
Hermione
ushered
them
out
the
hall
finalize
their
plans
for
the
evening
still
need
bit
the
people
you
changing
into
said
Hermione
matter
facdy
though
she
were
sending
them
the
supermarket
for
laundry
detergent
And
obviously
best
you
can
get
something
Crabbe
and
Goyle
they
Malfoys
best
friends
tell
them
anything
And
also
need
make
sure
the
real
Crabbe
and
Goyle
can
burst
while
interrogating
him
got
all
worked
out
she
went
smoothly
ignoring
Harry
and
Ron
stupefied
faces
She
held
two
plump
chocolate
cakes
filled
these
with
simple
Sleeping
Draught
All
you
have
make
sure
Crabbe
and
Goyle
find
them
You
know
how
greedy
they
are
they
bound
eat
them
Once
they
asleep
pull
out
few
their
hairs
and
hide
them
broom
closet
Harry
and
Ron
looked
incredulously
each
other
Hermione
don
think
That
could
seriously
wrong
But
Hermione
had
steely
glint
her
eye
not
unlike
the
one
Professor
McGonagall
sometimes
had
The
potion
will
useless
without
Crabbe
and
Goyle
hair
she
said
sternly
You
want
investigate
Malfoy
don
you
all
right
all
right
said
Harry
But
what
about
you
Whose
hair
are
you
ripping
out
213
already
got
mine
said
Hermione
brightly
pulling
tiny
bottle
out
her
pocket
and
showing
them
the
single
hair
inside
Remember
Millicent
Bulstrode
wrestling
with
the
Dueling
Club
She
left
this
robes
when
she
was
trying
strangle
And
she
gone
home
for
Christmas
just
have
tell
the
Slytherins
decided
come
back
When
Hermione
had
bustled
off
check
the
Polyjuice
Potion
again
Ron
turned
Harry
with
doom
laden
expression
Have
you
ever
heard
plan
where
many
things
could
wrong
But
Harry
and
Ron
utter
amazement
stage
one
the
operation
went
just
smoothly
Hermione
had
said
They
lurked
the
deserted
entrance
hall
after
Christmas
tea
waiting
for
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
had
remained
alone
the
Slytherin
table
shoveling
down
fourth
helpings
trifle
Harry
had
perched
the
chocolate
cakes
the
end
the
banisters
When
they
spotted
Crabbe
and
Goyle
coming
out
the
Great
Hall
Harry
and
Ron
hid
quickly
behind
suit
armor
next
the
front
door
How
thick
can
you
get
Ron
whispered
ecstatically
Crabbe
gleefully
pointed
out
the
cakes
Goyle
and
grabbed
them
Grinning
stupidly
they
stuffed
the
cakes
whole
into
their
large
mouths
For
moment
both
them
chewed
greedily
looks
triumph
their
faces
Then
without
the
smallest
change
expression
they
both
keeled
over
backward
onto
the
floor
far
the
hardest
part
was
hiding
them
the
closet
across
the
hall
Once
they
were
safely
stowed
among
the
buckets
and
mops
Harry
yanked
out
couple
the
bristles
that
covered
Goyle
fore
head
and
Ron
pulled
out
several
Crabbe
hairs
They
also
stole
their
shoes
because
their
own
were
far
too
small
for
Crabbe
and
Goyle
size
feet
Then
still
stunned
what
they
had
just
done
they
sprinted
Moaning
Myrtle
bathroom
They
could
hardly
see
for
the
thick
black
smoke
issuing
from
the
stall
which
Hermione
was
stirring
the
cauldron
Pulling
their
robes
over
their
faces
Harry
and
Ron
knocked
softly
the
door
Hermione
They
heard
the
scrape
the
lock
and
Hermione
emerged
shiny
faced
and
looking
anxious
Behind
her
they
heard
the
gloop
gloop
the
bubbling
glutinous
potion
Three
glass
tumblers
stood
ready
the
toilet
seat
Did
you
get
them
Hermione
asked
breathlessly
Harry
showed
her
Goyle
hair
Good
And
sneaked
these
spare
robes
out
the
laundry
Hermione
said
holding
small
sack
You
need
bigger
sizes
once
you
Crabbe
and
Goyle
The
three
them
stared
into
the
cauldron
Close
the
potion
looked
like
thick
dark
mud
bubbling
sluggishly
sure
done
everything
right
said
Hermione
nervously
rereading
the
splotched
page
Moste
Potente
Potions
looks
like
the
book
says
should
once
drunk
have
exactly
hour
before
change
back
into
ourselves
Now
what
Ron
whispered
separate
into
three
glasses
and
add
the
hairs
Hermione
ladled
large
dollops
the
potion
into
each
the
glasses
Then
her
hand
trembling
she
shook
Millicent
Bulstrode
hair
out
its
bottle
into
the
first
glass
215
The
potion
hissed
loudly
like
boiling
kettle
and
frothed
madly
second
later
had
turned
sick
sort
yellow
Urgh
essence
Millicent
Bulstrode
said
Ron
eyeing
with
loathing
Bet
tastes
disgusting
Add
yours
then
said
Hermione
Harry
dropped
Goyle
hair
into
the
middle
glass
and
Ron
put
Crabbe
into
the
last
one
Both
glasses
hissed
and
frothed
Goyle
turned
the
khaki
color
booger
Crabbe
dark
murky
brown
Hang
said
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
reached
for
their
glasses
better
not
all
drink
them
here
Once
turn
into
Crabbe
and
Goyle
won
fit
And
Millicent
Bulstrode
pixie
Good
thinking
said
Ron
unlocking
the
door
take
separate
stalls
Careful
not
spill
drop
his
Polyjuice
Potion
Harry
slipped
into
the
middle
stall
Ready
called
Ready
came
Ron
and
Hermione
voices
One
two
three
Pinching
his
nose
Harry
drank
the
potion
down
two
large
gulps
tasted
like
overcooked
cabbage
Immediately
his
insides
started
writhing
though
just
swallowed
live
snakes
doubled
wondered
whether
was
going
sick
then
burning
sensation
spread
rapidly
from
his
stomach
the
very
ends
his
fingers
and
toes
next
bringing
him
gasping
all
fours
came
horrible
melting
feeling
the
skin
all
over
his
body
bubbled
like
hot
wax
and
before
his
eyes
his
hands
began
grow
the
fingers
thickened
the
nails
broadened
2116
the
knuckles
were
bulging
like
bolts
his
shoulders
stretched
painfully
and
prickling
his
forehead
told
him
that
hair
was
creeping
down
toward
his
eyebrows
his
robes
ripped
his
chest
expanded
like
barrel
bursting
its
hoops
his
feet
were
agony
shoes
four
sizes
too
small
suddenly
had
started
everything
stopped
Harry
lay
facedown
the
stone
cold
floor
listening
Myrtle
gurgling
morosely
the
end
toilet
With
difficulty
kicked
off
his
shoes
and
stood
this
was
what
felt
like
being
Goyle
His
large
hand
trembling
pulled
off
his
old
robes
which
were
hanging
foot
above
his
ankles
pulled
the
spare
ones
and
laced
Goyle
boatlike
shoes
reached
brush
his
hair
out
his
eyes
and
met
only
the
short
growth
wiry
bristles
low
his
forehead
Then
realized
that
his
glasses
were
clouding
his
eyes
because
Goyle
obviously
didn
need
them
took
them
off
and
called
Are
you
two
okay
Goyle
low
rasp
voice
issued
from
his
mouth
Yeah
came
the
deep
grunt
Crabbe
from
his
right
Harry
unlocked
his
door
and
stepped
front
the
cracked
mirror
Goyle
stared
back
him
out
dull
deepset
eyes
Harry
scratched
his
ear
did
Goyle
Ron
door
opened
They
stared
each
other
Except
that
looked
pale
and
shocked
Ron
was
indistinguishable
from
Crabbe
from
the
pudding
bowl
haircut
the
long
gorilla
arms
This
unbelievable
said
Ron
approaching
the
mirror
and
prodding
Crabbe
flat
nose
Unbelievable
better
get
going
said
Harry
loosening
the
watch
that
was
cutting
into
Goyle
thick
wrist
still
got
find
out
217
where
the
Slytherin
common
room
only
hope
can
find
someone
follow
Ron
who
had
been
gazing
Harry
said
You
don
know
how
bizarre
see
Goyle
thinking
banged
Hermione
door
mon
need
high
pitched
voice
answered
him
don
think
going
come
after
all
You

Hermione
know
Millicent
Bulstrode
ugly
one
going
know
you
really
don
think
come
You
two
hurry
you
wasting
time
Harry
looked
Ron
bewildered
That
looks
more
like
Goyle
said
Ron
That
how
looks
every
time
teacher
asks
him
question
Hermione
are
you
okay
said
Harry
through
the
door
Fine
fine
Harry
looked
his
watch
Five
their
precious
sixty
minutes
had
already
passed
meet
you
back
here
all
right
said
Harry
and
Ron
opened
the
door
the
bathroom
carefully
checked
that
the
coast
was
clear
and
set
off
Don
swing
your
arms
like
that
Harry
muttered
Ron
Crabbe
holds
them
sort
stiff
How
this
Yeah
that
better
They
went
down
the
marble
staircase
All
they
needed
now
was
218
Slytherin
that
they
could
follow
the
Slytherin
common
room
but
there
was
nobody
around
Any
ideas
muttered
Harry
The
Slytherins
always
come
breakfast
from
over
there
said
Ron
nodding
the
entrance
the
dungeons
The
words
had
barely
left
his
mouth
when
girl
with
long
curly
hair
emerged
from
the
entrance
Excuse
said
Ron
hurrying
her
forgotten
the
way
our
common
room
beg
your
pardon
said
the
girl
stiffly
Our
common
room
Ravenclaw
She
walked
away
looking
suspiciously
back
them
Harry
and
Ron
hurried
down
the
stone
steps
into
the
darkness
their
footsteps
echoing
particularly
loudly
Crabbe
and
Goyle
huge
feet
hit
the
floor
feeling
that
this
wasn
going
easy
they
had
hoped
The
labyrinthine
passages
were
deserted
They
walked
deeper
and
deeper
under
the
school
constantly
checking
their
watches
see
how
much
time
they
had
left
After
quarter
hour
just
when
they
were
getting
desperate
they
heard
sudden
movement
ahead
said
Ron
excitedly
There
one
them
now
The
figure
was
emerging
from
side
room
they
hurried
nearer
however
their
hearts
sank
wasn
Slytherin
was
Percy
What
you
doing
down
here
said
Ron
surprise
Percy
looked
affronted
That
said
stiffly
none
your
business
Crabbe
isn
yeah
said
Ron
Well
get
off
your
dormitories
said
Percy
sternly
not
safe
wandering
around
dark
corridors
these
days
You
are
Ron
pointed
out
said
Percy
drawing
himself
prefect
Nothing
about
attack
voice
suddenly
echoed
behind
Harry
and
Ron
Draco
Malfoy
was
strolling
toward
them
and
for
the
first
time
his
life
Harry
was
pleased
see
him
There
you
are
drawled
looking
them
Have
you
two
been
pigging
out
the
Great
Hall
all
this
time
been
looking
for
you
want
show
you
something
really
funny
Malfoy
glanced
witheringly
Percy
And
what

down
here
Weasley
sneered
Percy
looked
outraged
You
want
show
bit
more
respect
school
prefect
said
don
like
your
attitude
Malfoy
sneered
and
motioned
for
Harry
and
Ron
follow
him
Harry
almost
said
something
apologetic
Percy
but
caught
himself
just
time
and
Ron
hurried
after
Malfoy
who
said
they
turned
into
the
next
passage
That
Peter
Weasley
Percy
Ron
corrected
him
automatically
Whatever
said
Malfoy
noticed
him
sneaking
around
lot
lately
And
bet
know
what
thinks
going
catch
Slytherin
heir
single
handed
gave
short
derisive
laugh
Harry
and
Ron
exchanged
excited
looks
Malfoy
paused
stretch
bare
damp
stone
wall
220
What
the
new
password
again
said
Harry
said
Harry
yeah
pure
blood
said
Malfoy
not
listening
and
stone
door
concealed
the
wall
slid
open
Malfoy
marched
through
and
Harry
and
Ron
followed
him
The
Slytherin
common
room
was
long
low
underground
room
with
rough
stone
walls
and
ceiling
from
which
round
greenish
lamps
were
hanging
chains
fire
was
crackling
under
elaborately
carved
mantelpiece
ahead
them
and
several
Slytherins
were
silhouetted
around
high
backed

said
Malfoy
Harry
and
Ron
motioning
them
pair
empty
chairs
set
back
from
the
fire
and
get
father
just
sent
Wondering
what
Malfoy
was
going
show
them
Harry
and
Ron
sat
down
doing
their
best
look
home
Malfoy
came
back
minute
later
holding
what
looked
like
newspaper
clipping
thrust
under
Ron
nose
That
give
you
laugh
said
Harry
saw
Ron
eyes
widen
shock
read
the
clipping
quickly
gave
very
forced
laugh
and
handed
Harry
had
been
clipped
out

called

for

Weasley

brought

into
disrepute
Malfoy
told
our
reporter
clearly
unfit

our
laws
and
his
ridiculous
Muggle
Protection
Act
should

immediately
Weasley
was
unavailable
for
comment
although
his
wife
told
reporters
clear
off
she
set
the
family
ghoul
them
Well
said
Malfoy
impatiently
Harry
handed
the
clipping
back
him
Don

think

said
Harry
bleakly
Arthur
Weasley
loves
Muggles
much
should
snap
his
wand
half
and
and
join
them
said
Malfoy
scornfully
You
never
know
the
Weasleys
were
pure
bloods
the
way
they
behave
Ron
rather
Crabbe
face
was
contorted
with
fury
What

Crabbe
snapped
Malfoy
Stomachache
Ron
grunted
Well

give
all

said
Malfoy
snickering
You
know
surprised
the
Daily
Prophet

reported
all
these
attacks
yet
went
thoughtfully
suppose
Dumbledore
trying

Malfoy
started
taking
pictures
with
imaginary
camera
and
did
cruel
but
accurate
impression
Colin
Potter
can
have
your
picture
Potter
Can
have
your
autograph
Can
lick
your
shoes
please
Potter
dropped
his
hands
and
looked
Harry
and
Ron
What
the
matter
with
you
two
Far
too
late
Harry
and
Ron
forced
themselves
laugh
but
Malfoy
seemed
satisfied
perhaps
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
always
slow
the
uptake
Saint
Potter
the
Mudbloods
friend
said
Malfoy
slowly
another
one
with
proper
wizard
feeling
wouldn
around
with
that
jumped
Granger
Mudblood
And
people
think
Slytherin
heir
Harry
and
Ron
waited
with
bated
breath
Malfoy
was
surely
seconds
away
from
telling
them
was
him
but
then
wish
knew
who
said
Malfoy
petulantly
could
help
them
Ron
jaw
dropped
that
Crabbe
looked
even
more
clueless
than
usual
Fortunately
Malfoy
didn
notice
and
Harry
thinking
fast
said
You
must
have
some
idea
who
behind
all
You
know
haven
Goyle
how
many
times
have
tell
you
snapped
Malfoy
And
Father
won
tell
anything
about
the
last
time
the
Chamber
was
opened
either
course
was
fifty
years
ago
was
before
his
time
but
knows
all
about
and
says
that
was
all
kept
quiet
and
look
suspicious
know
too
much
about
But
know
one
thing
last
time
the
Chamber
Secrets
was
opened
Mudblood
died
bet
matter
time
before
one
them
killed
this
time
hope
Granger
said
with
relish
Ron
was
clenching
Crabbe
gigantic
fists
Feeling
that
would
bit
giveaway
Ron
punched
Malfoy
Harry
shot
him
warning
look
and
said
you
know
the
person
who
opened
the
Chamber
last
time
was
caught
yeah
whoever
was
was
expelled
said
Malfoy
They
probably

Azkaban

Harry
puzzled
Azkaban

wizard
prison
Goyle
said
Malfoy
looking
him
disbelief
Honestly
you
were
any
slower
you
going
backward
shifted
restlessly
his
chair
and
said
Father
says
keep
head
down
and
let
the
Heir
Slytherin
get
with
says
the
school
needs
ridding
all
the
Mudblood
filth
but
not
get
mixed
course
got
lot
his
plate
the
moment
You
know
the
Ministry
Magic
raided
our
manor
last
week
Harry
tried
force
Goyle
dull
face
into
look
concern
Yeah
said
Malfoy
Luckily
they
didn
find
much
Father
got
some
very
valuable
Dark
Arts
stuff
But
luckily
got
our
own
secret
chamber
under
the
drawing
room
floor
said
Ron
Malfoy
looked
him
did
Harry
Ron
blushed
Even
his
hair
was
turning
red
His
nose
was
also
slowly
lengthening
their
hour
was
Ron
was
turning
back
into
himself
and
from
the
look
horror
was
suddenly
giving
Harry
must
too
They
both
jumped
their
feet
Medicine
for
stomach
Ron
grunted
and
without
further
ado
they
sprinted
the
length
the
Slytherin
common
room
hurled
themselves
the
stone
wall
and
dashed
the
passage
hoping
against
hope
that
Malfoy
hadn
noticed
anything
Harry
224
could
feel
his
feet
slipping
around
Goyle
huge
shoes
and
had
hoist
his
robes
shrank
they
crashed
the
steps
into
the
dark
entrance
hall
which
was
full
muffled
pounding
coming
from
the
closet
where
they
locked
Crabbe
and
Goyle
Leaving
their
shoes
outside
the
closet
door
they
sprinted
their
socks
the
marble
staircase
toward
Moaning
Myrtle
bathroom
Well
wasn
complete
waste
time
Ron
panted
closing
the
bathroom
door
behind
them
know
still
haven
found
out
who
doing
the
attacks
but
going
write
Dad

the
Malfoys

room
Harry
checked
his
face

cracked
mirror

put
his
glasses
Ron
hammered
the
door
Hermione
stall
Hermione

Hermione
squeaked
Harry
and
Ron
looked
each
other
What
the
matter
said
Ron
You
must
back
normal
now

But
Moaning
Myrtle
glided
suddenly
through
the
stall
door
Harry
had
never
seen
her
looking
happy
Ooooooh
wait
till
you
see
she
said
awful
They
heard
the
lock
slide
back
and
Hermione
emerged
sobbing
her
robes
pulled
over
her
head
What
said
Ron
uncertainly
Have
you
still
got
Millicent
nose
something
Hermione
let
her
robes
fall
and
Ron
backed
into
the
sink
Her
face
was
covered
black
fur
Her
eyes
had
turned
yellow
and
there
were
long
pointed
ears
poking
through
her
hair
was
cat
hair
she
howled
Millicent
Bulstrode
225
must
have
cat
And
the
potion

animal
transformations
said
Ron
You
teased
something
dreadful
said
Myrtle
happily
okay
Hermione
said
Harry
quickly
take
you
the
hospital
wing
Madam
Pomfrey
never
asks
too
many
questions
took
long
time
persuade
Hermione
leave
the
bathroom
Moaning
Myrtle
sped
them
their
way
with
hearty
guffaw
Wait
till
everyone
finds
out
you
got
tail
ermione
remained
the
hospital
wing
for
several
weeks
There
was
flurry
rumor
about
her
disappearance
when
the
rest
the
school
arrived
back
from
their
Christmas
holidays
because
course
everyone
thought
that
she
had
been
attacked
many
students
filed
past
the
hospital
wing
trying
catch
glimpse
her
that
Madam
Pomfrey
took
out
her
curtains
again
and
placed
them
around
Hermione
bed
spare
her
the
shame
being
seen
with
furry
face
Harry
and
Ron
went
visit
her
every
evening
When
the
new
term
started
they
brought
her
each
day
homework
sprouted
whiskers
take
break
from
work
said
Ron
tipping
stack
books
onto
Hermione
bedside
table
one
evening
Don
silly
Ron
got
keep
said
Hermione
briskly
Her
spirits
were
greatly
improved
the
fact
that
all
the
hair
had
gone
from
her
face
and
her
eyes
were
turning
slowly
back
brown
don
suppose
you
got
any
new
leads
she
added
whisper
that
Madam
Pomfrey
couldn
hear
her
Nothing
said
Harry
gloomily
was
sure
was
Malfoy
said
Ron
for
about
the
hundredth
time
What
that
asked
Harry
pointing
something
gold
sticking
out
from
under
Hermione
pillow
Just
get
well
card
said
Hermione
hastily
trying
poke
out
sight
but
Ron
was
too
quick
for
her
pulled
out
flicked
open
and
read
aloud
Miss
Granger
wishing
you
speedy
recovery
from
your
concerned
teacher
Professor

Class
Honorary

Ron
looked
Hermione
disgusted
You
sleep
with
this
under
your
pillow
But
Hermione
was
spared
answering
Madam
Pomfrey
sweeping
over
with
her
evening
dose
medicine
Lockhart
the
smarmiest
bloke
you
ever
met
what
Ron
said
Harry
they
left
the
infirmary
and
started
the
stairs
toward
Gryffindor
Tower
Snape
had
given
them
much
homework
Harry
thought
was
likely
the
sixth
year
before
finished
Ron
was
just
saying
wished
had
asked
Hermione
how
many
rat
tails
you
were
supposed
add
HairRaising
Potion
when
angry
outburst
from
the
floor
above
reached
their
ears
That
Filch
Harry
muttered
they
hurried
the
stairs
and
paused
out
sight
listening
hard
228
You
don
think
someone
else
been
attacked
said
Ron
tensely
They
stood
still
their
heads
inclined
toward
Flich
voice
which
sounded
quite
hysterical
even
more
work
for
Mopping
all
night
like
haven
got
enough
this
the
final
straw
going
Dumbledore
His
footsteps
receded
along
the
out
sight
corridor
and
they
heard
distant
door
slam
They
poked
their
heads
around
the
corner
Filch
had
clearly
been
manning
his
usual
lookout
post
They
were
once
again
the
spot
where
Mrs
Norris
had
been
attacked
They
saw
glance
what
Filch
had
been
shouting
about
great
flood
water
stretched
over
half
the
corridor
and
looked
though
was
still
seeping
from
under
the
door
Moaning
Myrtle
bathroom
Now
that
Filch
had
stopped
shouting
they
could
hear
Myrtle
wails
echoing
off
the
bathroom
walls
Now
what
with
her
said
Ron
Let
and
see
said
Harry
and
holding
their
robes
over
their
ankles
they
stepped
through
the
great
wash
water
the
door
bearing
its
OUT
ORDER
sign
ignored
always
and
entered
Moaning
Myrtle
was
crying
possible
louder
and
harder
than
ever
before
She
seemed
hiding
down
her
usual
toilet
was
dark
the
bathroom
because
the
candles
had
been
extinguished
the
great
rush
water
that
had
left
both
walls
and
floor
soaking
wet
What
Myrtle
said
Harry
Who
that
glugged
Myrtle
miserably
Come
throw
something
else
Harry
waded
across
her
stall
and
said
Why
would
throw
something
you
229
Don
ask
Myrtle
shouted
emerging
with
wave
yet
more
water
which
splashed
onto
the
already
sopping
floor
Here
minding
own
business
and
someone
thinks
funny
throw
book
But
can
hurt
you
someone
throws
something
you
said
Harry
reasonably
mean
just
right
through
you
wouldn
had
said
the
wrong
thing
Myrtle
puffed
herself
and
shrieked
Let
all
throw
books
Myrtle
because
she
can
feel
Ten
points
you
can
get
through
her
stomach
Fifty
points
goes
through
her
head
Well
What
lovely
game
don
think
Who
threw
you
anyway
asked
Harry
don
know
was
just
sitting
the
bend
thinking
about
death
and
fell
right
through
the
top
head
said
Myrtle
glaring
them
over
there
got
washed
out
Harry
and
Ron
looked
under
the
sink
where
Myrtle
was
pointing
small
thin
book
lay
there
had
shabby
black
cover
and
was
wet
everything
else
the
bathroom
Harry
stepped
forward
pick
but
Ron
suddenly
flung
out
arm
hold
him
back
What
said
Harry
Are
you
crazy
said
Ron
could
dangerous
Dangerous
said
Harry
laughing
Come
off
how
could
dangerous
You
surprised
said
Ron
who
was
looking
apprehensively
the
book
Some
the
books
the
Ministry
confiscated
Dad
told
there
was
one
that
burned
your
eyes
out
And
everyone
who
read
Sonnets
Sorcerer
spoke
limericks
for
the
rest
their
lives
And
some
old
witch
Bath
had
book
that
you
could
never
stop
reading
You
just
had
wander
around
with
your
nose
trying
everything
one
handed
And
All
right
got
the
point
said
Harry
The
little
book
lay
the
floor
nondescript
and
soggy
Well
won
find
out
unless
look
said
and
ducked
around
Ron
and
picked
off
the
floor
Harry
saw
once
that
was
diary
and
the
faded
year
the
cover
told
him
was
fifty
years
old
opened
eagerly
the
first
page
could
just
make
out
the
name
Riddle
smudged
ink
Hang
said
Ron
who
had
approached
cautiously
and
was
looking
over
Harry
shoulder
know
that
name
Riddle
got
award
for
special
services
the
school
fifty
years
ago
How
earth
you
know
that
said
Harry
amazement
Because
Filch
made
polish
his
shield
about
fifty
times
detention
said
Ron
resentfully
That
was
the
one
burped
slugs
all
over
you
wiped
slime
off
name
for
hour
you
remember
too
Harry
peeled
the
wet
pages
apart
They
were
completely
blank
There
wasn
the
faintest
trace
writing
any
them
not
even
Auntie
Mabel
birthday
dentist
half
past
three
never
wrote
said
Harry
disappointed
wonder
why
someone
wanted
flush
away
said
Ron
curiously
Harry
turned
the
back
cover
the
book
and
saw
the
printed
name
variety
store
Vauxhall
Road
London
231
must
been
Muggle
born
said
Harry
thoughtfufly
have
bought
diary
from
Vauxhall
Road
Well
not
much
use
you
said
Ron
dropped
his
voice
Fifty
points
you
can
get
through
Myrtle
nose
Harry
however
pocketed
Hermione
left
the
hospital
wing
whiskered
tail
less
and
furfree
the
beginning
February
her
first
evening
back
Gryffindor
Tower
Harry
showed
her
Riddle
diary
and
told
her
the
story
how
they
had
found
Oooh
might
have
hidden
powers
said
Hermione
enthusiastically
taking
the
diary
and
looking
closely
has
hiding
them
very
well
said
Ron
Maybe
shy
don
know
why
you
don
chuck
Harry
wish
knew
why
someone
did
try
chuck
said
Harry
wouldn
mind
knowing
how
Riddle
got
award
for
special
services
Hogwarts
either
Could
been
anything
said
Ron
Maybe
got
thirty
saved
teacher
from
the
giant
squid
Maybe
murdered
Myrtle
that
would
done
everyone
favor
But
Harry
could
tell
from
the
arrested
look
Hermione
face
that
she
was
thinking
what
was
thinking
What
said
Ron
looking
from
one
the
other
Well
the
Chamber
Secrets
was
opened
fifty
years
ago
wasn
said
That
what
Malfoy
said
Yeah
said
Ron
slowly
And
this
diary
fifty
years
old
said
Hermione
tapping
excitedly
232
Ron
wake
snapped
Hermione
know
the
person
who
opened
the
Chamber
last
time
was
expelled
fifty
years
ago
know
Riddle
got
award
for
special
services
the
school
fifty
years
ago
Well
what
Riddle
got
his
special
award
for
catching
the
Heir
Slytherin
His
diary
would
probably
tell
everything
where
the
Chamber
and
how
open
and
what
sort
creature
lives
the
person
who
behind
the
attacks
this
time
wouldn
want
that
lying
around
would
they
That
brilliant
theory
Hermione
said
Ron
with
just
one
tiny
little
flaw
There
nothing
written
his
diary
But
Hermione
was
pulling
her
wand
out
her
bag
might
invisible
ink
she
whispered
She
tapped
the
diary
three
times
and
said
Aparecium
Nothing
happened
Undaunted
Hermione
shoved
her
hand
back
into
her
bag
and
pulled
out
what
appeared
bright
red
eraser
Revealer
got
Diagon
Alley
she
said
She
rubbed
hard
January
first
Nothing
happened
telling
you
there
nothing
find
there
said
Ron
Riddle
just
got
diary
for
Christmas
and
couldn
bothered
filling
Harry
couldn
explain
even
himself
why
didn
just
throw
Riddle
diary
away
The
fact
was
that
even
though
knew
the
diary
was
blank
kept
absentmindedly
picking
and
turning
the
pages
though
were
story
wanted
finish
And
while
Harry
was
sure
had
never
heard
the
name
Riddle
before
still
seemed
mean
something
him
almost
though
233
Riddle
was
friend
had
when
was
very
small
and
had
halfforgotten
But
this
was
absurd
never
had
friends
before
Hogwarts
Dudley
had
made
sure
that
Nevertheless
Harry
was
determined
find
out
more
about
Riddle
next
day
break
headed
for
the
trophy
room
examine
Riddle
special

interested
Hermione
and
thoroughly
unconvinced
Ron
who

tucked
away
corner
cabinet
didn
carry

Good
thing
too
even

and

said
Ron
However
they
did
find
Riddle
name
old
Medal
for
Magical
Merit
and
list
old
Head

Percy
said
Ron
wrinkling
his
nose
disgust
Prefect
Head
Boy
probably
top
every
class
You
say
that
like
bad
thing
said
Hermione
slightly
hurt
voice
The
sun
had
now
begun
shine
weakly
Hogwarts
again
Inside
the
castle
the
mood
had
grown
more
hopeful
There
had
been
more
attacks
since
those
Justin
and
Nearly
Headless
Nick
and
Madam
Pomfrey
was
pleased
report
that
the
Mandrakes
were
becoming
moody
and
secretive
meaning
that
they
were
fast
leaving
childhood
The
moment
their
acne
clears
they
ready
for
repotting
again
Harry
heard
her
telling
Filch
kindly
one
afternoon
And
after
that
won
long
until
cutting
them
and
stewing
them
You
have
Mrs
Norris
back
time
243
Perhaps
the
Heir
Slytherin
had
lost
his
her
nerve
thought
Harry
must
getting
riskier
and
riskier
open
the
Chamber
Secrets
with
the
school
alert
and
suspicious
Perhaps
the
monster
whatever
was
was
even
now
settling
itself
down
hibernate
for
another
fifty
years
Ernie
Macmillan
Hufflepuff
didn
take
this
cheerful
view
was
still
convinced
that
Harry
was
the
guilty
one
that
had
given
himself
away
the
Dueling
Club
Peeves
wasn
helping
matters
kept
popping
the
crowded
corridors
singing
Potter
you
rotter
now
with
dance
routine
match
Gilderoy
Lockhart
seemed
think
himself
had
made
the
attacks
stop
Harry
overheard
him
telling
Professor
McGonagall
while
the
Gryffindors
were
lining
for
Transfiguration
don
think
there
any
more
trouble
Minerva
said
tapping
his
nose
knowingly
and
winking
think
the
Chamber
has
been
locked
for
good
this
time
The
culprit
must
have
known
was
only
matter
time
before
caught
him
Rather
sensible
stop
now
before
came
down
hard
him
You
know
what
the
school
needs
now
morale
booster
Wash
away
the
memories
last
term
won
say
any
more
just
now
but
think
know
just
the
thing
tapped
his
nose
again
and
strode
off
Lockhart
idea
morale
booster
became
clear
breakfast
time
February
fourteenth
Harry
hadn
had
much
sleep
because
late
running
Quidditch
practice
the
night
before
and
hurried
down
the
Great
Hall
slightly
late
thought
for
moment
that
walked
through
the
wrong
doors
The
walls
were
all
covered
with
large
lurid
pink
flowers
Worse
235
still
heart
shaped
confetti
was
falling
from
the
pale
blue
ceiling
Harry
went
over
the
Gryffindor
table
where
Ron
was
sitting
looking
sickened
and
Hermione
seemed
have
been
overcome
with
giggles
What
going
Harry
asked
them
sitting
down
and
wiping
confetti
off
his
bacon
Ron
pointed
the
teachers
table
apparently
too
disgusted
speak
Lockhart
wearing
lurid
pink
robes
match
the
decorations
was
waving
for
silence
The
teachers
either
side
him
were
looking
stony
faced
From
where
sat
Harry
could
see
muscle
going
Professor
McGonagall
cheek
Snape
looked
though
someone
had
just
fed
him
large
beaker
Skele
Gro
Happy
Valentine
Day
Lockhart
shouted
And
may
thank
the
forty
six
people
who
have
far
sent
cards
Yes
have
taken
the
liberty
arranging
this
little
surprise
for
you
all
and
doesn
end
here
Lockhart
clapped
his
hands
and
through
the
doors
the
entrance
hall
marched
dozen
surly
looking
dwarfs
Not
just
any
dwarfs
however
Lockhart
had
them
all
wearing
golden
wings
and
carrying
harps
friendly
card
carrying
cupids
beamed
Lockhart
They
will
roving
around
the
school
today
delivering
your
valentines
And
the
fun
doesn
stop
here
sure
colleagues
will
want
enter
into
the
spirit
the
occasion
Why
not
ask
Professor
Snape
show
you
how
whip
Love
Potion
And
while
you
Professor
Flitwick
knows
more
about
Entrancing
Enchantments
than
any
wizard
ever
met
the
sly
old
dog
Professor
Flitwick
buried
his
face
his
hands
Snape
was

236
ing
though
the
first
person
ask
him
for
Love
Potion
would
force
fed
poison
Please
Hermione
tell
you
weren
one
the
forty
six
said
Ron
they
left
the
Great
Hall
for
their
first
lesson
Hermione
suddenly
became
very
interested
searching
her
bag
for
her
schedule
and
didn
answer
All
day
long
the
dwarfs
kept
barging
into
their
classes
deliver
valentines
the
annoyance
the
teachers
and
late
that
afternoon
the
Gryffindors
were
walking
upstairs
for
Charms
one
the
dwarfs
caught
with
Harry

Hot

Harry
tried

The
dwarf
however
cut
his
way
through
the
crowd
kicking
people

and
reached
him
before

two
paces

Not

Stay

grunted
the
dwarf
grabbing
hold
Harry
bag
and
pulling
him
back
Let
Harry
snarled
tugging
With
loud
ripping
noise
his
bag
split
two
His
books
wand
parchment
and
quill
spilled
onto
the
floor
and
his
ink
bottle
smashed
over
everything
Harry
scrambled
around
trying
pick
all
before
the
dwarf
started
singing
causing
something
holdup
the
corridor
237
What
going
here
came
the
cold
drawling
voice
Draco
Malfoy
Harry
started
stuffing
everything
feverishly
into
his
ripped
bag
desperate
get
away
before
Malfoy
could
hear
his
musical
valentine
What
all
this
commotion
said
another
familiar
voice
Percy
Weasley
arrived
Losing
his
head
Harry
tried
make
run
for
but
the
dwarf
seized
him
around
the
knees
and
brought
him
crashing
the
floor
Right

Here

His

really
divine
The
hero
who
conquered
the
Dark
Lord
Harry
would
have
given
all
the
gold
Gringotts
evaporate
the
spot
Trying
valiantly
laugh
along
with
everyone
else
got
his
feet
numb
from
the
weight
the
dwarf
Percy
Weasley
did
his
best
disperse
the
crowd
some
whom
were
crying
with
mirth
Off
you
off
you
the
bell
rang
five
minutes
ago
off
class
now
said
shooing
some
the
younger
students
away
And
you
Malfoy
Harry
glancing
over
saw
Malfoy
stoop
and
snatch
something
Leering
showed
Crabbe
and
Goyle
and
Harry
realized
that
got
Riddle
diary
Give
that
back
said
Harry
quietly
Wonder
what
Potter
written
this
said
Malfoy
who
obvi
238
ously
hadn
noticed
the
year
the
cover
and
thought
had
Harry
own
diary
hush
fell
over
the
onlookers
Ginny
was
staring
from
the
diary
Harry
looking
terrified
Hand
over
Malfoy
said
Percy
sternly
When
had
look
said
Malfoy
waving
the
diary
tauntingly
Harry
Percy
said
school
prefect
but
Harry
had
lost
his
temper
pulled
out
his
wand
and
shouted
Expelliarmus
and
just
Snape
had
disarmed
Lockhart
Malfoy
found
the
diary
shooting
out
his
hand
into
the
air
Ron
grinning
broadly
caught
Harry
said
Percy
loudly
magic
the
corridors
have
report
this
you
know
But
Harry
didn
care
was
one
Malfoy
and
that
was
worth
five
points
from
Gryffindor
any
day
Malfoy
was
looking
furious
and
Ginny
passed
him
enter
her
classroom
yelled
spitefully
after
her
don
think
Potter
liked
your
valentine
much
Ginny
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
ran
into
class
Snarling
Ron
pulled
out
his
wand
too
but
Harry
pulled
him
away
Ron
didn
need
spend
the
whole
Charms
belching
slugs
wasn
until
they
had
reached
Professor
Flitwick
class
that
Harry
noticed
something
rather
odd
about
Riddle
diary
All
his
other
books
were
drenched
scarlet
ink
The
diary
however
was
clean
had
been
before
the
ink
bottle
had
smashed
all
over
tried
point
this
out
Ron
but
Ron
was
having
trouble
with
his
wand
again
large
purple
bubbles
were
blossoming
out
the
end
and
wasn
much
interested
anything
else
Harry
went
bed
before
anyone
else
his
dormitory
that
night
This
was
partly
because
didn
think
could
stand
Fred
and
George
singing
His
eyes
are
green
fresh
pickled
toad
one
more
time
and
partly
because
wanted
examine
Riddle
diary
again
and
knew
that
Ron
thought
was
wasting
his
time
Harry
sat
his
four
poster
and
flicked
through
the
blank
pages
not
one
which
had
trace
scarlet
ink
Then
pulled
new
bottle
out
his
bedside
cabinet
dipped
his
quill
into
and
dropped
blot
onto
the
first
page
the
diary
The
ink
shone
brightly
the
paper
for
second
and
then
though
was
being
sucked
into
the
page
vanished
Excited
Harry
loaded
his
quill
second
time
and
wrote
name
Harry
Potter
The
words
shone
momentarily
the
page
and
they
too
sank
without
trace
Then
last
something
happened
Oozing
back
out
the
page
his
very
own
ink
came
words
Harry
had
never
written
Hello
Harry
Potter
name
Tom
Riddle
How
did
you
come
diary
These
words
too
faded
away
but
not
before
Harry
had
started
scribble
back
Someone
tried
flush
down
toilet
waited
eagerly
for
Riddle
reply
Lucky
that
recorded
memories
some
more
lasting
way
than
ink
But
always
knew
that
there
would
those
who
would
not
want
this
diary
read
What
you
mean
Harry
scrawled
blotting
the
page
his
excitement
240
mean
that
this
diary
holds
memories
terrible
things
Things
that
were
covered
Things
that
happened
Hogwarts
School
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
That
where
now
Harry
wrote
quickly
Hogwarts
and
horrible
stuff
been
happening
you
know
anything
about
the
Chamber
Secrets
His
heart
was
hammering
Riddle
reply
came
quickly
his
writing
becoming
untidier
though
was
hurrying
tell
all
knew
course
know
about
the
Chamber
Secrets
day
they
told
was
legend
that
did
not
exist
But
this
was
lie
fifth
year
the
Chamber
was
opened
and
the
monster
attacked
several
students
finally
killing
one
caught
the
person
whod
opened
the
Chamber
and
was
expelled
But
the
Headmaster
Professor
Dippet
ashamed
that
such
thing
had
happened
Hogwarts
forbade
tell
the
truth
story
was
given
out
that
thegirl
had
died
freak
accident
They
gave
nice
shiny
engraved
trophy
for
trouble
and
warned
keep
mouth
shut
But
knew
could
happen
again
The
monster
lived
and
the
one
who
had
the
power
release
was
not
imprisoned
Harry
nearly
upset
his
ink
bottle
his
hurry
write
back
happening
again
now
There
have
been
three
attacks
and
one
seems
know
who
behind
them
Who
was
last
time
can
show
you
you
like
came
Riddle
reply
You
don
have
take
word
for
can
take
you
inside
memory
the
night
when
caught
him
Harry
hesitated
his
quill
suspended
over
the
diary
What
did
Riddle
mean
How
could
taken
inside
somebody
else
memory
glanced
nervously
the
door
the
dormitory
which
was
241
growing
dark
When
looked
back
the
diary
saw
fresh
words
forming
Let
show
you
Harry
paused
for
fraction
second
and
then
wrote
two
letters
40K
The
pages
the
diary
began
blow
though
caught
high
wind
stopping
halfway
through
the
month
June
Mouth
hanging
open
Harry
saw
that
the
little
square
for
June
thirteenth
seemed
have
turned
into
miniscule
television
screen
His
hands
trembling
slightly
raised
the
book
press
his
eye
against
the
little
window
and
before
knew
what
was
happening
was
tilting
forward
the
window
was
widening
felt
his
body
leave
his
bed
and
was
pitched
headfirst
through
the
opening
the
page
into
whirl
color
and
shadow
felt
his
feet
hit
solid
ground
and
stood
shaking
the
blurred
shapes
around
him
came
suddenly
into
focus
knew
immediately
where
was
This
circular
room
with
the
sleeping
portraits
was
Dumbledore
office
but
wasn
Dumbledore
who
was
sitting
behind
the
desk
wizened
fraillooking
wizard
bald
except
for
few
wisps
white
hair
was
reading
letter
candlelight
Harry
had
never
seen
this
man
before
sorry
said
shakily
didn
mean
butt
But
the
wizard
didn
look
continued
read
frowning
slightly
Harry
drew
nearer
his
desk
and
stammered
just
shall
Still
the
wizard
ignored
him
didn
seem
even
have
heard
him
Thinking
that
the
wizard
might
deaf
Harry
raised
his
voice
242
Sorry
disturbed
you
now
half
shouted
The
wizard
folded
the
letter
with
sigh
stood
walked
past
Harry
without
glancing
him
and
went
draw
the
curtains
his
window
The
sky
outside
the
window
was
ruby
red
seemed
sunset
The
wizard
went
back
the
desk
sat
down
and
twiddled
his
thumbs
watching
the
door
Harry
looked
around
the
office
Fawkes
the
phoenix
whirring
silver
contraptions
This
was
Hogwarts
Riddle
had
known
meaning
that
this
unknown
wizard
was
Headmaster
not
Dumbledore
and
Harry
was
little
more
than
phantom
completely
invisible
the
people
fifty
years
ago
There
was
knock
the
office
door
Enter
said
the
old
wizard
feeble
voice
boy
about
sixteen
entered
taking
off
his
pointed
hat
silver
prefect
badge
was
glinting
his
chest
was
much
taller
than
Harry
but
too
had
jet
black
hair
Riddle
said
the
Headmaster
You
wanted
see
Professor
Dippet
said
Riddle
looked
nervous
Sit
down
said
Dippet
just
been
reading
the
letter
you
sent
said
Riddle
sat
down
gripping
his
hands
together
very
tightly
dear
boy
said
Dipper
kindly
cannot
possibly
let
you
stay
school
over
the
summer
Surely
you
want
home
for
the
holidays
said
Riddle
once
much
rather
stay
Hogwarts
than
back
that
that
243
You
live
Muggle
orphanage
during
the
holidays
believe
said
Dippet
curiously
Yes
sir
said
Riddle
reddening
slightly
You
are
Muggle
born
Half
blood
sir
said
Riddle
Muggle
father
witch
mother
And
are
both
your
parents
mother
died
just
after
was
born
sir
They
told
the
orphanage
she
lived
just
long
enough
name
Tom
after
father
Marvolo
after
grandfather
Dipper
clucked
his
tongue
sympathetically
The
thing
Tom
sighed
Special
arrangements
might
have
been
made
for
you
but
the
current
circumstances
You
mean
all
these
attacks
sir
said
Riddle
and
Harry
heart
leapt
and
moved
closer
scared
missing
anything
Precisely
said
the
headmaster
dear
boy
you
must
see
how
foolish
would
allow
you
remain
the
castle
when
term
ends
Particularly
light
the
recent
tragedy
the
death
that
poor
little
girl
You
will
safer
far
your
orphanage
matter
fact
the
Ministry
Magic
even
now
talking
about
closing
the
school
are
nearer
locating
the
source
all
this
unpleasantness
Riddle
eyes
had
widened
Sir
the
person
was
caught
all
stopped
What
you
mean
said
Dippet
with
squeak
his
voice
sitting
his
chair
Riddle
you
mean
you
know
something
about
these
attacks
sir
said
Riddle
quickly
But
Harry
was
sure
was
the
same
sort
that
himself
had
given
Dumbledore
244
Dippet
sank
back
looking
faintly
disappointed
You
may
Tom
Riddle
slid
off
his
chair
and
slouched
out
the
room
Harry
followed
him
Down
the
moving
spiral
staircase
they
went
emerging
next
the
gargoyle
the
darkening
corridor
Riddle
stopped
and
did
Harry
watching
him
Harry
could
tell
that
Riddle
was
doing
some
serious
thinking
was
biting
his
lip
his
forehead
furrowed
Then
though
had
suddenly
reached
decision
hurried
off
Harry
gliding
noiselessly
behind
him
They
didn
see
another
person
until
they
reached
the
entrance
hall
when
tall
wizard
with
long
sweeping
auburn
hair
and
beard
called
Riddle
from
the
marble
staircase
What
are
you
doing
wandering
around
this
late
Tom
Harry
gaped
the
wizard
was
none
other
than
fifty
year
younger
Dumbledore
had
see
the
headmaster
sir
said
Riddle
Well
hurry
off
bed
said
Dumbledore
giving
Riddle
exactly
the
kind
penetrating
stare
Harry
knew
well
Best
not
roam
the
corridors
these
days
Not
since
sighed
heavily
bade
Riddle
good
night
and
strode
off
Riddle
watched
him
walk
out
sight
and
then
moving
quickly
headed
straight
down
the
stone
steps
the
dungeons
with
Harry
hot
pursuit
But
Harry
disappointment
Riddle
led
him
not
into
hidden
passageway
secret
tunnel
but
the
very
dungeon
which
Harry
had
Potions
with
Snape
The
torches
hadn
been
lit
and
when
Riddle
pushed
the
door
almost
closed
Harry
could
only
just
see
him
standing
stock
still
the
door
watching
the
passage
outside
felt
Harry
that
they
were
there
for
least
hour
All
could
see
was
the
figure
Riddle
the
door
staring
through
the
crack
waiting
like
statue
And
just
when
Harry
had
stopped
feeling
expectant
and
tense
and
started
wishing
could
return
the
present
heard
something
move
beyond
the
door
Someone
was
creeping
along
the
passage
heard
whoever
was
pass
the
dungeon
where
and
Riddle
were
hidden
Riddle
quiet
shadow
edged
through
the
door
and
followed
Harry
tiptoeing
behind
him
forgetting
that
couldn
heard
For
perhaps
five
minutes
they
followed
the
footsteps
until
Riddle
stopped
suddenly
his
head
inclined
the
direction
new
noises
Harry
heard
door
creak
open
and
then
someone
speaking
hoarse
whisper
mon
gotta
get
yeh
outta
here
mon
now
the
box
There
was
something
familiar
about
that
voice
Riddle
suddenly
jumped
around
the
corner
Harry
stepped
out
behind
him
could
see
the
dark
outline
huge
boy
who
was
crouching
front
open
door
very
large
box
next
Evening
Rubeus
said
Riddle
sharply
The
boy
slammed
the
door
shut
and
stood
What
yer
doin
down
here
Tom
Riddle
stepped
closer
all
over
said
going
have
turn
you
Rubeus
They
talking
about
closing
Hogwarts
the
attacks
don
stop
yeh
don
think

But

pets

exercise
and

one
said
the
large
boy
backing
against
the
closed
door
From
behind
him
Harry
could
hear
funny
rustling
and
clicking
Come
Rubeus
said
Riddle
moving
yet
closer
The
dead
girl
parents
will
here
tomorrow
The
least
Hogwarts
can
make
sure
that
the
thing
that
killed
their
daughter
slaughtered
wasn
him
roared
the
boy
his
voice
echoing
the
dark
passage
wouldn
never
Stand
aside
said
Riddle
drawing
out
his
wand
His
spell
lit
the
corridor
with
sudden
flaming
light
The
door
behind
the
large
boy
flew
open
with
such
force
knocked
him
into
the
wall
opposite
And
out
came
something
that
made
Harry
let
out
long
piercing
scream
unheard
anyone
vast
low
slung
hairy
body
and
tangle
black
legs
gleam
many
eyes
and
pair
razor
sharp
pincers
Riddle
raised
his
wand
again
but
was
too
late
The
thing
bowled
him
over
scuttled
away
tearing
the
corridor
and
out
sight
Riddle
scrambled
his
feet
looking
after
raised
his
wand
but
the
huge
boy
leapt
him
seized
his
wand
and
threw
him
back
down
yelling
NO000000
The
scene
whirled
the
darkness
became
complete
Harry
felt
himself
falling
and
with
crash
landed
spread
eagled
his
four
poster
the
Gryffindor
dormitory
Riddle
diary
lying
open
his
stomach
Before
had
had
time
regain
his
breath
the
dormitory
door
opened
and
Ron
came
There
you
are
said
Harry
sat
was
sweating
and
shaking
What
said
Ron
looking
him
with
concern
was
Hagrid
Ron
Hagrid
opened
the
Chamber
Secrets
fifty
years
ago
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
always
known
that
Hagrid
had
unfortunate
liking
for
large
and
monstrous
creatures
During
their
first
year
Hogwarts
had
tried
raise
dragon
his
little
wooden
house
and
would
long
time
before
they
forgot
the
giant
three
headed
dog
christened
Fluffy
And
boy
Hagrid
had
heard
that
monster
was
hidden
somewhere
the
castle
Harry
was
sure
have
gone
any
lengths
for
glimpse
probably
thought
was
shame
that
the
monster
had
been
cooped
long
and
thought
deserved
the
chance
stretch
its
many
legs
Harry
could
just
imagine
the
thirteen
year
old
Hagrid
trying
fit
leash
and
collar
But
was
equally
certain
that
Hagrid
would
never
have
meant
kill
anybody
Harry
half
wished
hadn
found
out
how
work
Riddle
diary
Again
and
again
Ron
and
Hermione
made
him
recount
what
seen
until
was
heartily
sick
telling
them
and
sick
the
long
circular
conversations
that
followed
Riddle
might
have
got
the
wrong
person
said
Hermione
Maybe
was
some
other
monster
that
was
attacking
people
How
many
monsters
you
think
this
place
can
hold
Ron
asked
dully
always
knew
Hagrid
had
been
expelled
said
Harry
miserably
And
the
attacks
must
stopped
after
Hagrid
was
kicked
out
Otherwise
Riddle
wouldn
have
got
his
award
Ron
tried
different
tack
Riddle
does
sound
like
Percy
who
asked
him
squeal
Hagrid
anyway
But
the
monster
had
killed
someone
Ron
said
Hermione
And
Riddle
was
going
back
some
Muggle
orphanage
they
closed
Hogwarts
said
Harry
don
blame
him
for
wanting
stay
here
You
met
Hagrid
down
Knockturn
Alley
didn
you
Harry
was
buying
Flesh
Eating
Slug
Repellent
said
Harry
quickly
The
three
them
fell
silent
After
long
pause
Hermione
voiced
the
knottiest
question
all
hesitant
voice
you
think
should
and
ask
Hagrid
about
all
That
cheerful
visit
said
Ron
Hello
Hagrid
Tell
have
you
been
setting
anything
mad
and
hairy
loose
the
castle
lately
the
end
they
decided
that
they
would
not
say
anything
Hagrid
unless
there
was
another
attack
and
more
and
more
days
went
with
whisper
from
the
disembodied
voice
they
became
hopeful
that
they
would
never
need
talk
him
about
why
had
been
expelled
was
now
nearly
four
months
since
Justin
and
Nearly
Headless
Nick
had
been
Petrified
and
nearly
everybody
seemed
think
that
the
attacker
whoever
was
had
retired
for
good
Peeves
had
finally
got
bored
his
Potter
you
rotter
song
Ernie
Macmillan
asked
Harry
quite
politely
pass
bucket
leaping
toadstools
Herbology
one
day
and
March
several
the
Mandrakes
threw
loud
and
raucous
party
greenhouse
three
This
made
Professor
Sprout
very
happy
The
moment
they
start
trying
move
into
each
other
pots
know
they
fully
mature
she
told
Harry
Then
able
revive
those
poor
people
the
hospital
wing
The
second
years
were
given
something
new
think
about
during
their
Easter
holidays
The
time
had
come
choose
their
subjects
for
the
third
year
matter
that
Hermione
least
took
very
seriously
could
affect
our
whole
future
she
told
Harry
and
Ron
they
pored
over
lists
new
subjects
marking
them
with
checks
just
want
give
Potions
said
Harry
can
said
Ron
gloomily
keep
all
our
old
subjects
ditched
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
But
that
very
important
said
Hermione
shocked
Not
the
way
Lockhart
teaches
said
Ron
haven
learned
anything
from
him
except
not
set
pixies
loose
Neville
Longbottom
had
been
sent
letters
from
all
the
witches
and
wizards
his
family
all
giving
him
different
advice
what
choose
Confused
and
worried
sat
reading
the
subject
lists
with
his
tongue
poking
out
asking
people
whether
they
thought
Arithmancy
sounded
more
difficult
than
the
study
Ancient
Runes
Dean
Thomas
who
like
Harry
had
grown
with
Muggles
ended
closing
his
eyes
and
jabbing
his
wand
the
list
then
picking
the
subjects
landed
Hermione
took
nobody
advice
but
signed
for
everything
Harry
smiled
grimly
himself
the
thought
what
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
would
say
tried
discuss
his
career
wizardry
with
them
Not
that
didn
get
any
guidance
Percy
Weasley
was
eager
share
his
experience
Depends
where
you
want
Harry
said
never
too
early
think
about
the
future
recommend
Divination
People
say
Muggle
Studies
soft
option
but
personally
think
wizards
should
have
thorough
understanding
the
non
magical
community
particularly
they
thinking
working
close
contact
with
them
look
father
has
deal
with
Muggle
business
all
the
time
brother
Charlie
was
always
more
outdoor
type
went
for
Care
Magical
Creatures
Play
your
strengths
Harry
But
the
only
thing
Harry
felt
was
really
good
was
Quidditch
the
end
chose
the
same
new
subjects
Ron
feeling
that
was
lousy
them
least
have
someone
friendly
help
him
Gryffindor
next
Quidditch
match
would
against
Hufflepuff
Wood
was
insisting
team
practices
every
night
after
dinner
that
Harry
barely
had
time
for
anything
but
Quidditch
and
homework
However
the
training
sessions
were
getting
better
least
drier
and
the
evening
before
Saturday
match
went
his
dormitory
drop
off
his
broomstick
feeling
Gryffindor
chances
for
the
Quidditch
cup
had
never
been
better
But
his
cheerful
mood
didn
last
long
the
top
the
stairs
the
dormitory
met
Neville
Longbottom
who
was
looking
frantic
Harry
don
know
who
did
just
found
Watching
Harry
fearfully
Neville
pushed
open
the
door
The
contents
Harry
trunk
had
been
thrown
everywhere
His
cloak
lay
ripped
the
floor
The
bedclothes
had
been
pulled
off
his
four
poster
and
the
drawer
had
been
pulled
out
his
bedside
cabinet
the
contents
strewn
over
the
mattress
Harry
walked
over
the
bed
open
mouthed
treading
few
loose
pages
Travels
with
Trolls
and
Neville
pulled
the
blankets
back
onto
his
bed
Ron
Dean
and
Seamus
came
Dean
swore
loudly
What
happened
Harry
idea
said
Harry
But
Ron
was
examining
Harry
robes
All
the
pockets
were
hanging
out
Someone
been
looking
for
something
said
Ron
there
anything
missing
Harry
started
pick
all
his
things
and
throw
them
into
his
trunk
was
only
threw
the
last
the
Lockhart
books
back
into
that
realized
what
wasn
there
Riddle
diary
gone
said
undertone
Ron
What
Harry
jerked
his
head
toward
the
dormitory
door
and
Ron
followed
him
out
They
hurried
down
the
Gryffindor
common
room
which
was
half
empty
and
joined
Hermione
who
was
sitting
alone
reading
book
called
Ancient
Runes
Made
Easy
Hermione
looked
aghast
the
news
But
only
Gryffindor
could
have
stolen
nobody
else
knows
our
password
Exactly
said
Harry
They
woke
the
next
day
brilliant
sunshine
and
light
refreshing
breeze
Perfect
Quidditch
conditions
said
Wood
enthusiastically
the
Gryffindor
table
loading
the
team
plates
with
scrambled
eggs
Harry
buck
there
you
need
decent
breakfast
Harry
had
been
staring
down
the
packed
Gryffindor
table
wondering
the
new
owner
Riddle
diary
was
right
front
his
eyes
Hermione
had
been
urging
him
report
the
robbery
but
Harry
didn
like
the
idea
have
tell
teacher
all
about
the
diary
and
how
many
people
knew
why
Hagrid
had
been
expelled
fifty
years
ago
didn
want
the
one
who
brought
all
again
left
the
Great
Hall
with
Ron
and
Hermione
and
collect
his
Quidditch
things
another
very
serious
worry
was
added
Harry
growing
list
had
just
set
foot
the
marble
staircase
when
heard
yet
again
Kill
this
time
let
rip
tear
shouted
aloud
and
Ron
and
Hermione
both
jumped
away
from
him
alarm
The
voice
said
Harry
looking
over
his
shoulder
just
heard
again
didn
you
Ron
shook
his
head
wide
eyed
Hermione
however
clapped
hand
her
forehead
Harry
think
just
understood
something
got
the
library
And
she
sprinted
away
the
stairs
What
does
she
understand
said
Harry
distractedly
still
looking
around
trying
tell
where
the
voice
had
come
from
Loads
more
than
said
Ron
shaking
his
head
But
why
she
got
the
library
Because
that
what
Hermione
does
said
Ron
shrugging
When
doubt
the
library
Harry
stood
irresolute
trying
catch
the
voice
again
but
people
were
now
emerging
from
the
Great
Hall
behind
him
talking
loudly
exiting
through
the
front
doors
their
way
the
Quidditch
pitch
You
better
get
moving
said
Ron
nearly
eleven
the
match
Harry
raced
Gryffindor
Tower
collected
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
and
joined
the
large
crowd
swarming
across
the
grounds
but
his
mind
was
still
the
castle
along
with
the
bodiless
voice
and
pulled
his
scarlet
robes
the
locker
room
his
only
comfort
was
that
everyone
was
now
outside
watch
the
game
The
teams
walked
onto
the
field
tumultuous
applause
Oliver
Wood
took
off
for
warm
flight
around
the
goal
posts
Madam
Hooch
released
the
balls
The
Hufflepuffs
who
played
canary
yellow
were
standing
huddle
having
last
minute
discussion
tactics
Harry
was
just
mounting
his
broom
when
Professor
McGonagall
came
half
marching
half
running
across
the
pitch
carrying
enormous
purple
megaphone
Harry
heart
dropped
like
stone
This
match
has
been
cancelled
Professor
McGonagall
called
through
the
megaphone
addressing
the
packed
stadium
There
were
boos
and
shouts
Oliver
Wood
looking
devastated
landed
and
ran
toward
Professor
McGonagall
without
getting
off
his
broomstick
But
Professor
shouted
got
play
the
cup
Gryffindor
Professor
McGonagall
ignored
him
and
continued
shout
through
her
megaphone
All
students
are
make
their
way
back
the
House
common
rooms
where
their
Heads
Houses
will
give
them
further
information
quickly

can
please
Then
she
lowered
the
megaphone
and
beckoned
Harry
over
her
Potter
think
you
better
come
with
Wondering
how
she
could
possibly
suspect
him
this
time
Harry
saw
Ron
detach
himself
from
the
complaining
crowd
came
running
them
they
set
off
toward
the
castle
Harry
surprise
Professor
McGonagall
didn
object
Yes
perhaps
you
better
come
too
Weasley
Some
the
students
swarming
around
them
were
grumbling
about
the
match
being
canceled
others
looked
worried
Harry
and
Ron
followed
Professor
McGonagall
back
into
the
school
and
the
marble
staircase
But
they
weren
taken
anybody
office
this
time
This
will
bit
shock
said
Professor
McGonagall
surprisingly
gentle
voice
they
approached
the
infirmary
There
has
been
another
attack
another
double
attack
Harry
insides
did
horrible
somersault
Professor
McGonagall
pushed
the
door
open
and
and
Ron
entered
Madam
Pomfrey
was
bending
over
fifth
year
girl
with
long
curly
hair
Harry
recognized
her
the
Ravenclaw
they
accidentally
asked
for
directions
the
Slytherin
common
room
And
the
bed
next
her
was
Hermione
Ron
groaned
Hermione
lay
utterly
still
her
eyes
open
and
glassy
They
were
found
near
the
library
said
Professor
McGonagall
don
suppose
either
you
can
explain
this
was
the
floor
next
them
She
was
holding
small
circular
mirror
Harry
and
Ron
shook
their
heads
both
staring
Hermione
will
escort
you
back
Gryffindor
Tower

Professor
McGonagall
heavily

There

The
Gryffindors
packed
inside
the
common
room
listened
Professor
McGonagall
silence
She
rolled
the
parchment
from
which
she
had
been
reading
and
said
somewhat
choked
voice
need
hardly
add
that
have
rarely
been
distressed
likely
that
the
school
will
closed
unless
the
culprit
behind
these
attacks
caught
would
urge
anyone
who
thinks
they
might
know
anything
about
them
come
forward
She
climbed
somewhat
awkwardly
out
the
portrait
hole
and
the
Gryffindors
began
talking
immediately
That
two
Gryffindors
down
not
counting
Gryffindor
ghost
one
Ravenclaw
and
one
Hufflepuff
said
the
Weasley
twins
friend
Lee
Jordan
counting
his
fingers
Haven
any
the
teachers
noticed
that
the
Slytherins
are
all
safe
Isn
obvious

stuff
coming
from
Slytherin
The
Heir
Slytherin
the
monster
Slytherin
why
don
they
just
chuck
all
the
Slytherins
out
roared
nods
and
scattered
applause
Percy
Weasley
was
sitting
chair
behind
Lee
but
for
once
didn
seem
keen
make
his
views
heard

looking
pale
and
stunned
Percy
shock
George
told
Harry
quietly
That
Ravenclaw
girl
Penelope
Clearwater
she
prefect
don
think
thought
the
monster
would
dare
attack
prefect
But
Harry
was
only
half
listening
didn
seem
able
get
rid
the
picture
Hermione
lying
the
hospital
bed
though
carved
out
stone
And
the
culprit
wasn
caught
soon
was
looking
lifetime
back
with
the
Dursleys
Tom
Riddle
had
turned
Hagrid
because
was
faced
with
the
prospect
Muggle
orphanage
the
school
closed
Harry
now
knew
exactly
how
had
felt
What
going
said
Ron
quietly
Harry
ear
you
think
they
suspect
Hagrid
got

said
Harry
making
his
mind
can
believe
him
this
time
but
set
the
monster
loose
last
time
know
how
get
inside
the
Chamber
Secrets
and
that
start
But
McGonagall
said

Harry
more
quietly
still
time
get
dad
old
cloak
out
again
Harry
had
inherited
ust
one
thing
from
his
father
long
and
sil
very
Invisibility
Cloak
was
their
only
chance
sneaking
out
the
school
visit
Hagrid
without
anyone
knowing
about
They
went
bed
the
usual
time
waited
until
Neville
Dean
and
Sea
mus
had
stopped
discussing
the
Chamber
Secrets
and
finally
fallen
asleep
then
got
dressed
again
and
threw
the
cloak
over
themselves
The
journey
through
the
dark
and
deserted
castle
corridors
wasn
enjoyable
Harry
who
had
wandered
the
castle
night
sev
eral
times
before
had
never
seen
crowded
after
sunset
Teach
ers
prefects
and
ghosts
were
marching
the
corridors
pairs
staring
around
for
any
unusual
activity
Their
Invisibility
Cloak
didn
stop
them
making
any
noise
and
there
was
particularly
tense
moment
when
Ron
stubbed
his
toe
only
yards
from
the
spot
where
Snape
stood
standing
guard
Thankfully
Snape
sneezed
almost
exactly
the
moment
Ron
swore
was
with
relief
that
they
reached
the
oak
front
doors
and
eased
them
open
was
clear
starry
night
They
hurried
toward
the
lit
windows
Hagrid
house
and
pulled
off
the
cloak
only
when
they
were
right
outside
his
front
door
Seconds
after
they
had
knocked
Hagrid
flung
open
They
found
themselves
face
face
with
him
aiming
crossbow
them
Fang
the
boarhound
barked
loudly
behind
him
said
lowering
the
weapon
and
staring
them
What
you
two
doin
here
What
that
for
said
Harry
pointing
the
crossbow
they
stepped
inside
Nothin
nothin
Hagrid
muttered
bin
expectin
doesn
matter
Sit
down
make
tea
hardly
seemed
know
what
was
doing
nearly
extinguished
the
fire
spilling
water
from
the
kettle
and
then
smashed
the
teapot
with
nervous
jerk
his
massive
hand
Are
you
okay
Hagrid
said
Harry
Did
you
hear
about
Hermione
heard
all
righ
said
Hagrid
slight
break
his
voice
kept
glancing
nervously
the
windows
poured
them
both
large
mugs
boiling
water
had
forgotten
add
tea
bags
and
was
just
putting
slab
fruitcake
plate
when
there
was
loud
knock
the
door
Hagrid
dropped
the
fruitcake
Harry
and
Ron
exchanged
panicstricken
looks
then
threw
the
Invisibility
Cloak
back
over
themselves
and
retreated
into
corner
Hagrid
checked
that
they
were
hidden
seized
his
crossbow
and
flung
open
his
door
once
more
Good
evening
Hagrid
was
Dumbledore
entered
looking
deadly
serious
and
was
followed
second
very
odd
looking
man
The
stranger
had
rumpled
gray
hair
and
anxious
expression
and
was
wearing
strange
mixture
clothes
pinstriped
suit
scarlet
tie
long
black
cloak
and
pointed
purple
boots
Under
his
arm
carried
lime
green
bowler
That
Dad
boss
Ron
breathed
Cornelius
Fudge
the
Minister
Magic
Harry
elbowed
Ron
hard
make
him
shut
Hagrid
had
gone
pale
and
sweaty
dropped
into
one
his
chairs
and
looked
from
Dumbledore
Cornelius
Fudge
Bad
business
Hagrid
said
Fudge
rather
clipped
tones
Very
bad
business
Had

Four
attacks
Muggle
borns
Things

far
enough
Ministry

said
Hagrid
looking
imploringly
Dumbledore
You

Professor
Dumbledore

Cornelius
that
Hagrid
has
full
confidence
said
Dumbledore
frowning
Fudge
Look
Albus

Fudge
uncomfortably
Hagrid
record
against
him
Ministry

school
governors

been

Yet
again
Cornelius
tell
you
that
taking
Hagrid
away

not
help
the
slightest
said
Dumbledore
His
blue
eyes
were
full
fire
Harry
had
never
seen
before
Look
from
point
view
said
Fudge
fidgeting
with
his
bowler
under
lot
pressure
Got

Hagrid
back
and
more
said
But

take
him
Got

said
Hagrid
who
was
trembling
Take

For
short
stretch
only
said
Fudge
not

Hagrid
eyes
Not

Hagrid
more
precaution
someone

with
full
apology
Not
Azkaban
croaked
Hagrid
Before
Fudge
could
answer
there
was
another
loud
rap
the
door
Dumbledore
answered
was
Harry
turn
for
elbow
the
ribs
let
out
audible
gasp
Lucius
Malfoy
strode
into
Hagrid
hut
swathed
long
black
traveling
cloak
smiling
cold
and
satisfied
smile
Fang
started
growl
Already
here
Fudge
said
approvingly
Good
good
What
you
doin
here
said
Hagrid
furiously
Get
outta
house
dear
man
please
believe
have
pleasure
all
being
inside
your
you
call
this
house
said
Lucius
Malfoy
sneering
looked
around
the
small
cabin
simply
called
the
school
and
was
told
that
the
headmaster
was
here
And
what
exactly
did
you
want
with
Lucius
said
Dumbledore
spoke
politely
but
the
fire
was
still
blazing
his
blue
eyes
Dreadful
thing
Dumbledore
said
Malfoy
lazily
taking
out
long
roll
parchment
but
the
governors
feel
time
for
you
step
aside
This
Order
Suspension
you
find
all
twelve
signatures
afraid
feel
you
losing
your
touch
How
many
attacks
have
there
been
now
Two
more
this
afternoon
wasn
this
rate
there
Muggle
borns
left
Hogwarts
and
all
know
what
awful
loss
that
would
the
school
now
see
here
Lucius
said
Fudge
looking
alarmed
Dumbledore
suspended
last
thing
want
just
now
262
The
appointment
suspension
the
headmaster
matter
for
the
governors
Fudge
said
Malfoy
smoothly
And
Dumbledore
has
failed
stop
these
attacks
See
here
Malfoy
Dumbledore
can
stop
them
said
Fudge
whose
upper
lip
was
sweating
now
mean
say
who
can
That
remains
seen
said
Malfoy
with
nasty
smile
But
all
twelve
have
voted
Hagrid
leapt
his
feet
his
shaggy
black
head
grazing
the
ceiling
how
many
did
yeh
have
ter
threaten
blackmail
before
they
agreed
Malfoy
roared
Dear
dear
you
know
that
temper
yours
will
lead
you
into
trouble
one
these
days
Hagrid
said
Malfoy
would
advise
you
not
shout
the
Azkaban
guards
like
that
They
won
like
all
Yeh
can
take
Dumbledore
yelled
Hagrid
making
Fang
the
boarhound
cower
and
whimper
his
basket
Take
him
away
the
Muggle
borns
won
stand
chance
There
killin
next
Calm
yourself
Hagrid
said
Dumbledore
sharply
looked
Lucius
Malfoy
the
governors
want
removal
Lucius
shall
course
step
aside
But
stuttered
Fudge
growled
Hagrid
Dumbledore
had
not
taken
his
bright
blue
eyes
off
Lucius
Malfoy
cold
gray
ones
However
said
Dumbledore
speaking
very
slowly
and
clearly
that
none
them
could
miss
word
you
will
find
that
will
ummer
was
creeping
over
the
grounds
around
the
castle
sky
and
lake
alike
turned
periwinkle
blue
and
flowers
large
cabbages
burst
into
bloom
the
greenhouses
But
with
Hagrid
visible
from
the
castle
windows
striding
the
grounds
with
Fang
his
heels
the
scene
didn
look
right
Harry
better
fact
than
the
inside
the
castle
where
things
were
horribly
wrong
Harry
and
Ron
had
tried
visit
Hermione
but
visitors
were
now
barred
from
the
hospital
wing
taking
more
chances
Madam
Pomfrey
told
them
severely
through
crack
the
infirmary
door
sorry
there
every
chance
the
attacker
might
come
back
finish
these
people
off
With
Dumbledore
gone
fear
had
spread
never
before
that
the
sun
warming
the
castle
walls
outside
seemed
stop
the
mullioned
windows
There
was
barely
face
seen
the
school
265
that
didn
look
worried
and
tense
and
any
laughter
that
rang
through
the
corridors
sounded
shrill
and
unnatural
and
was
quickly
stifled
Harry
constantly
repeated
Dumbledore
final
words
himself
will
only
truly
have
left
this
school
when
none
here
are
loyal
Help
will
always
given
Hogwarts
those
who
ask
for
But
what
good
were
these
words
Who
exactly
were
they
supposed
ask
for
help
when
everyone
was
just
confused
and
scared
they
were
Hagrid
hint
about
the
spiders
was
far
easier
understand
the
trouble
was
there
didn
seem
single
spider
left
the
castle
follow
Harry
looked
everywhere
went
helped
rather
reluctantly
Ron
They
were
hampered
course
the
fact
that
they
weren
allowed
wander
off
their
own
but
had
move
around
the
castle
pack
with
the
other
Gryffindors
Most
their
fellow
students
seemed
glad
that
they
were
being
shepherded
from
class
class
teachers
but
Harry
found
very
irksome
One
person
however
seemed
thoroughly
enjoying
the
atmosphere
terror
and
suspicion
Draco
Malfoy
was
strutting
around
the
school
though
had
just
been
appointed
Head
Boy
Harry
didn
realize
what
was
pleased
about
until
the
Potions
lesson
about
two
weeks
after
Dumbledore
and
Hagrid
had
left
when
sitting
right
behind
Malfoy
Harry
overheard
him
gloating
Crabbe
and
Goyle
always
thought
Father
might
the
one
who
got
rid
Dumbledore
said
not
troubling
keep
his
voice
down
told
you
thinks
Dumbledore
the
worst
headmaster
the
school
ever
266
had
Maybe
get
decent
headmaster
now
Someone
who
won
want
the
Chamber
Secrets
closed
McGonagall
won
last
long
she
only
filling
Snape
swept
past
Harry
making
comment
about
Hermione
empty
seat
and
cauldron
Sir
said
Malfoy
loudly
Sir
why
don
you
apply
for
the
headmaster
job
Now
now
Malfoy
said
Snape
though
couldn
suppress
thin
lipped
smile
Professor
Dumbledore
has
only
been
suspended
the
governors
daresay
back
with
soon
enough
Yeah
right
said
Malfoy
smirking
expect
you
have
Father
vote
sir
you
wanted
apply
for
the
job
tell
Father
you
the
best
teacher
here
sir
Snape
smirked
swept
off
around
the
dungeon
fortunately
not
spotting
Seamus
Finnigan
who
was
pretending
vomit
into
his
cauldron
quite
surprised
the
Mudbloods
haven
all
packed
their
bags
now
Malfoy
went
Bet
you
five
Galleons
the
next
one
dies
Pity
wasn
Granger
The
bell
rang
that
moment
which
was
lucky
Malfoy
last
words
Ron
had
leapt
off
his
stool
and
the
scramble
collect
bags
and
books
his
attempts
reach
Malfoy
went
unnoticed
Let
him
Ron
growled
Harry
and
Dean
hung
onto
his
arms
don
care
don
need
wand
going
kill
him
with
bare
hands
Hurry
got
take
you
all
Herbology
barked
Snape
over
the
class
heads
and
off
they
marched
with
Harry
Ron
and
Dean
bringing
the
rear
Ron
still
trying
get
loose
was
only
261
safe
let
him
when
Snape
had
seen
them
out
the
castle
and
they
were
making
their
way
across
the
vegetable
patch
toward
the
greenhouses
The
Herbology
class
was
very
subdued
there
were
now
two
missing
from
their
number
Justin
and
Hermione
Professor
Sprout
set
them
all
work
pruning
the
Abyssinian
Shrivelfigs
Harry
went
tip
armful
withered
stalks
onto
the
compost
heap
and
found
himself
face
face
with
Ernie
Macmillan
Ernie
took
deep
breath
and
said
very
formally
just
want
say
Harry
that
sorry
ever
suspected
you
know
you
never
attack
Hermione
Granger
and
apologize
for
all
the
stuff
said
all
the
same
boat
now
and
well
held
out
pudgy
hand
and
Harry
shook
Ernie
and
his
friend
Hannah
came
work
the
same
Shrivelfig
Harry
and
Ron
That
Draco
Malfoy
character
said
Ernie
breaking
off
dead
twigs
seems
very
pleased
about
all
this
doesn
you
know
think
might
Slytherin
heir
That
clever
you
said
Ron
who
didn
seem
have
forgiven
Ernie
readily
Harry
you
think
Malfoy
Harry
Ernie
asked
said
Harry
firmly
that
Ernie
and
Hannah
stared
second
later
Harry
spotted
something
Several
large
spiders
were
scuttling
over
the
ground
the
other
side
the
glass
moving
unnaturally
straight
line
though
taking
the
shortest
route
prearranged
meeting
Harry
hit
Ron
over
the
hand
with
his
pruning
shears
Ouch
What
you
268
Harry
pointed
out
the
spiders
following
their
progress
with
his
eyes
screwed
against
the
sun
yeah
said
Ron
trying
and
failing
look
pleased
But
can
follow
them
now
Ernie
and
Hannah
were
listening
curiously
Harry
eyes
narrowed
focused
the
spiders
they
pursued
their
fixed
course
there
could
doubt
about
where
they
would
end
Looks
like
they
heading
for
the
Forbidden
Forest
And
Ron
looked
even
unhappier
about
that
the
end
the
lesson
Professor
Sprout
escorted
the
class
their
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
Harry
and
Ron
lagged
behind
the
others
they
could
talk
out
earshot
have
use
the
Invisibility
Cloak
again
Harry
told
Ron
can
take
Fang
with
used
going
into
the
forest
with
Hagrid
might
some
help
Right
said
Ron
who
was
twirling
his
wand
nervously
his
fingers
aren
there
aren
there
supposed
werewolves
the
forest
added
they
took
their
usual
places
the
back
Lockhart
classroom
Preferring
not
answer
that
question
Harry
said
There
are
good
things
there
too
The
centaurs
are
all
right
and
the
unicorns
Ron
had
never
been
into
the
Forbidden
Forest
before
Harry
had
entered
only
once
and
had
hoped
never
again
Lockhart
bounded
into
the
room
and
the
class
stared
him
Every
other
teacher
the
place
was
looking
grimmer
than
usual
but
Lockhart
appeared
nothing
short
buoyant
Come
now
cried
beaming
around
him
Why
all
these
long
faces
People
swapped
exasperated
looks
but
nobody
answered
Don
you
people
realize
said
Lockhart
speaking
slowly
though
they
were
all
bit
dim
the
danger
has
passed
The
culprit
has
been
taken
away
Says
who
said
Dean
Thomas
loudly
dear
young
man
the
Minister
Magic
wouldn
have
taken
Hagrid
hadn
been
one
hundred
percent
sure
that
was
guilty
said
Lockhart
the
tone
someone
explaining
that
one
and
one
made
two
yes
would
said
Ron
even
more
loudly
than
Dean
flatter
myself
know
touch
more
about
Hagrid
arrest
than
you
Weasley
said
Lockhart
self
satisfied
tone
Ron
started
say
that
didn
think
somehow
but
stopped
midsentence
when
Harry
kicked
him
hard
under
the
desk
weren
there
remember
Harry
muttered
But
Lockhart
disgusting
cheeriness
his
hints
that
had
always
thought
Hagrid
was
good
his
confidence
that
the
whole
business
was
now
end
irritated
Harry
much
that
yearned
throw
Gadding
with
Ghouls
right
Lockhart
stupid
face
Instead
contented
himself
with
scrawling
note
Ron
Let
tonight
Ron
read
the
message
swallowed
hard
and
looked
sideways
the
empty
seat
usually
filled
Hermione
The
sight
seemed
stiffen
his
resolve
and
nodded
The
Gryffindor
common
room
was
always
very
crowded
these
days
because
from
six
clock
onward
the
Gryffindors
had
270
where
else
They
also
had
plenty
talk
about
with
the
result
that
the
common
room
often
didn
empty
until
past
midnight
Harry
went
get
the
Invisibility
Cloak
out
his
trunk
right
after
dinner
and
spent
the
evening
sitting
waiting
for
the
room
clear
Fred
and
George
challenged
Harry
and
Ron
few
games
Exploding
Snap
and
Ginny
sat
watching
them
very
subdued
Hermione
usual
chair
Harry
and
Ron
kept
losing
purpose
trying
finish
the
games
quickly
but
even
was
well
past
midnight
when
Fred
George
and
Ginny
finally
went
bed
Harry
and
Ron
waited
for
the
distant
sounds
two
dormitory
doors
closing
before
seizing
the
cloak
throwing
over
themselves
and
climbing
through
the
portrait
hole
was
another
difficult
journey
through
the
castle
dodging
all
the
teachers
last
they
reached
the
entrance
hall
slid
back
the
lock
the
oak
front
doors
squeezed
between
them
trying
stop
any
creaking
and
stepped
out
into
the
moonlit
grounds
Course
said
Ron
abruptly
they
strode
across
the
black
grass
might
get
the
forest
and
find
there
nothing
follow
Those
spiders
might
not
been
going
there
all
know
looked
like
they
were
moving
that
sort
general
direction
but
His
voice
trailed
away
hopefully
They
reached
Hagrid
house
sad
and
sorry
looking
with
its
blank
windows
When
Harry
pushed
the
door
open
Fang
went
mad
with
joy
the
sight
them
Worried
might
wake
everyone
the
castle
with
his
deep
booming
barks
they
hastily
fed
him
treacle
fudge
from
tin
the
mantelpiece
which
glued
his
teeth
together
Harry
left
the
Invisibility
Cloak
Hagrid
table
There
would
need
for
the
pitch
dark
forest
mon
Fang
going
for
walk
said
Harry
patting
his
leg
and
Fang
bounded
happily
out
the
house
behind
them
dashed
the
edge
the
forest
and
lifted
his
leg
against
large
sycamore
tree
Harry
took
out
his
wand
murmured
Lumos
and
tiny
light
appeared
the
end
just
enough
let
them
watch
the
path
for
signs
spiders
Good
thinking
said
Ron
light
mine
too
but
you
know
probably
blow
something
Harry
tapped
Ron
the
shoulder
pointing
the
grass
Two
solitary
spiders
were
hurrying
away
from
the
wandlight
into
the
shade
the
trees
Okay
Ron
sighed
though
resigned
the
worst
ready
Let
with
Fang
scampering
around
them
sniffing
tree
roots
and
leaves
they
entered
the
forest
the
glow
Harry
wand
they
followed
the
steady
trickle
spiders
moving
along
the
path
They
walked
behind
them
for
about
twenty
minutes
not
speaking
listening
hard
for
noises
other
than
breaking
twigs
and
rustling
leaves
Then
when
the
trees
had
become
thicker
than
ever
that
the
stars
overhead
were
longer
visible
and
Harry
wand
shone
alone
the
sea
dark
they
saw
their
spider
guides
leaving
the
path
Harry
paused
trying
see
where
the
spiders
were
going
but
everything
outside
his
little
sphere
light
was
pitch
black
had
never
been
this
deep
into
the
forest
before
could
vividly
remember
Hagrid
advising
him
not
leave
the
forest
path
last
time
been
here
But
Hagrid
was
miles
away
now
probably
sitting
cell
Azkaban
and
had
also
said
follow
the
spiders
Something
wet
touched
Harry
hand
and
jumped
backward
crushing
Rods
foot
but
was
only
Fang
nose
What
you
reckon
Harry
said
Ron
whose
eyes
could
just
make
out
reflecting
the
light
from
his
wand
come
this
far
said
Ron
they
followed
the
darting
shadows
the
spiders
into
the
trees
They
couldn
move
very
quickly
now
there
were
tree
roots
and
stumps
their
way
barely
visible
the
near
blackness
Harry
could
feel
Fang
hot
breath
his
hand
More
than
once
they
had
stop
that
Harry
could
crouch
down
and
find
the
spiders
the
wandlight
They
walked
for
what
seemed
like
least
half
hour
their
robes
snagging
low
slung
branches
and
brambles
After
while
they
noticed
that
the
ground
seemed
sloping
downward
though
the
trees
were
thick
ever
Then
Fang
suddenly
let
loose
great
echoing
bark
making
both
Harry
and
Ron
jump
out
their
skins
What
said
Ron
loudly
looking
around
into
the
pitch
dark
and
gripping
Harry
elbow
very
hard
There
something
moving
over
there
Harry
breathed
Listen
sounds
like
something
big
They
listened
Some
distance
their
right
the
something
big
was
snapping
branches
carved
path
through
the
trees
said
Ron
Shut
said
Harry
frantically
hear
you
Hear
said
Ron
unnaturally
high
voice
already
heard
Fang
The
darkness
seemed
pressing
their
eyeballs
they
273
stood
terrified
waiting
There
was
strange
rumbling
noise
and
then
silence
What
you
think
doing
said
Harry
Probably
getting
ready
pounce
said
Ron
They
waited
shivering
hardly
daring
move
you
think
gone
Harry
whispered
Dunno
Then
their
right
came
sudden
blaze
light
bright
the
darkness
that
both
them
flung
their
hands
shield
their
eyes
Fang
yelped
and
tried
run
but
got
lodged
tangle
thorns
and
yelped
even
louder
Harry
Ron
shouted
his
voice
breaking
with
relief
Harry
our
car
What
Come
Harry
blundered
after
Ron
toward
the
light
stumbling
and
tripping
and
moment
later
they
had
emerged
into
clearing
Weasley
car
was
standing
empty
the
middle
circle
thick
trees
under
roof
dense
branches
its
headlights
ablaze
Ron
walked
open
mouthed
toward
moved
slowly
toward
him
exactly
like
large
turquoise
dog
greeting
its
owner
been
here
all
the
time
said
Ron
delightedly
walking
around
the
car
Look
The
forest
turned
wild
The
sides
the
car
were
scratched
and
smeared
with
mud
Apparently
had
taken
trundling
around
the
forest
its
own
Fang
didn
seem
all
keen
kept
close
Harry
who
could
feel
him
quivering
His
breathing
slowing
down
again
Harry
stuffed
his
wand
back
into
his
robes
214
And
thought
was
going
attack
said
Ron
leaning
against
the
car
and
patting
wondered
where
had
gone
Harry
squinted
around
the
floodlit
ground
for
signs
more
spiders
but
they
had
all
scuttled
away
from
the
glare
the
headlights
lost
the
trail
said
mon
let
and
find
them
Ron
didn
speak
didn
move
His
eyes
were
fixed
point
some
ten
feet
above
the
forest
floor
right
behind
Harry
His
face
was
livid
with
terror
Harry
didn
even
have
time
turn
around
There
was
loud
clicking
noise
and
suddenly
felt
something
long
and
hairy
seize
him
around
the
middle
and
lift
him
off
the
ground
that
was
hanging
facedown
Struggling
terrified
heard
more
clicking
and
saw
Ron
legs
leave
the
ground
too
heard
Fang
whimpering
and
howling
next
moment
was
being
swept
away
into
the
dark
trees
Head
hanging
Harry
saw
that
what
had
hold
him
was
marching
six
immensely
long
hairy
legs
the
front
two
clutching
him
tightly
below
pair
shining
black
pincers
Behind
him
could
hear
another
the
creatures
doubt
carrying
Ron
They
were
moving
into
the
very
heart
the
forest
Harry
could
hear
Fang
fighting
free
himself
from
third
monster
whining
loudly
but
Harry
couldn
have
yelled
even
had
wanted
seemed
have
left
his
voice
back
with
the
car
the
clearing
never
knew
how
long
was
the
creature
clutches
only
knew
that
the
darkness
suddenly
lifted
enough
for
him
see
that
the
leaf
strewn
ground
was
now
swarming
with
spiders
Craning
his
neck
sideways
realized
that
they
had
reached
the
ridge
vast
hollow
hollow
that
had
been
cleared
trees
that
the
stars
shone
brightly
onto
the
worst
scene
had
ever
laid
eyes
Spiders
Not
tiny
spiders
like
those
surging
over
the
leaves
below
Spiders
the
size
carthorses
eight
eyed
eight
legged
black
hairy
gigantic
The
massive
specimen
that
was
carrying
Harry
made
its
way
down
the
steep
slope
toward
misty
domed
web
the
very
center
the
hollow
while
its
fellows
closed
all
around
clicking
their
pincers
excitedly
the
sight
its
load
Harry
fell
the
ground
all
fours
the
spider
released
him
Ron
and
Fang
thudded
down
next
him
Fang
wasn
howling
anymore
but
cowering
silently
the
spot
Ron
looked
exactly
like
Harry
felt
His
mouth
was
stretched
wide
kind
silent
scream
and
his
eyes
were
popping
Harry
suddenly
realized
that
the
spider
that
had
dropped
him
was
saying
something
had
been
hard
tell
because
clicked
his
pincers
with
every
word
spoke
Aragog
called
Aragog
And
from
the
middle
the
misty
domed
web
spider
the
size
small
elephant
emerged
very
slowly
There
was
gray
the
black
his
body
and
legs
and
each
the
eyes
his
ugly
pincered
head
was
milky
white
was
blind
What
said
clicking
his
pincers
rapidly
Men
clicked
the
spider
who
had
caught
Harry
Hagrid
said
Aragog
moving
closer
his
eight
milky
eyes
wandering
vaguely
Strangers
clicked
the
spider
who
had
brought
Ron
Kill
them
clicked
Aragog
fretfully
was
sleeping
friends
Hagrid
Harry
shouted
His
heart
seemed
have
left
his
chest
pound
his
throat
216
Click
click
click
went
the
pincers
the
spiders
all
around
the
hollow
Aragog
paused
Hagrid
has
never
sent
men
into
our
hollow
before
said
slowly
Hagrid
trouble
said
Harry
breathing
very
fast
That
why
come
trouble
said
the
aged
spider
and
Harry
thought
heard
concern
beneath
the
clicking
pincers
But
why
has
sent
you
Harry
thought
getting
his
feet
but
decided
against
didn
think
his
legs
would
support
him
spoke
from
the
ground
calmly
could
They
think
the
school
that
Hagrid
been
setting
something
students
They
taken
him
Azkaban
Aragog
clicked
his
pincers
furiously
and
all
around
the
hollow
the
sound
was
echoed
the
crowd
spiders
was
like
applause
except
applause
didn
usually
make
Harry
feel
sick
with
fear
But
that
was
years
ago
said
Aragog
fretfully
Years
and
years
ago
remember
well
That
why
they
made
him
leave
the
school
They
believed
that
was
the
monster
that
dwells
what
they
call
the
Chamber
Secrets
They
thought
that
Hagrid
had
opened
the
Chamber
and
set
free
And
you
you
didn
come
from
the
Chamber
Secrets
said
Harry
who
could
feel
cold
sweat
his
forehead
said
Aragog
clicking
angrily
was
not
born
the
castle
come
from
distant
land
traveler
gave
Hagrid
when
was
egg
Hagrid
was
only
boy
but
cared
for
hidden
cupboard
the
castle
feeding
scraps
from
the
table
Hagrid
good
friend
and
good
man
When
was
discovered
and
blamed
for
the
death
girl
protected
have
lived
here
the
forest
ever
since
where
Hagrid
still
visits
even
found
wife
Mosag
and
you
see
how
our
family
has
grown
all
through
Hagrid
goodness
Harry
summoned
what
remained
his
courage
you
never
never
attacked
anyone
Never
croaked
the
old
spider
would
have
been
instinct
but
out
respect
for
Hagrid
never
harmed
human
The
body
the
girl
who
was
killed
was
discovered
bathroom
never
saw
any
part
the
castle
but
the
cupboard
which
grew
Our
kind
like
the
dark
and
the
quiet
But
then
you
know
what
did
kill
that
girl
said
Harry
Because
whatever
back
and
attacking
people
again
His
words
were
drowned
loud
outbreak
clicking
and
the
rustling
many
long
legs
shifting
angrily
large
black
shapes
shifted
all
around
him
The
thing
that
lives
the
castle
said
Aragog
ancient
creature
spiders
fear
above
all
others
Well
remember
how
pleaded
with
Hagrid
let
when
sensed
the
beast
moving
about
the
school
What
said
Harry
urgently
More
loud
clicking
more
rustling
the
spiders
seemed
closing
not
speak
said
Aragog
fiercely
not
name
never
even
told
Hagrid
the
name
that
dread
creature
though
asked
many
times
Harry
didn
want
press
the
subject
not
with
the
spiders
pressing
closer
all
sides
Aragog
seemed
tired
tamng
was
backing
slowly
into
his
domed
web
but
his
fellow
spiders
continued
inch
slowly
toward
Harry
and
Ron
just
then
Harry
called
desperately
Aragog
hearing
leaves
rustling
behind
him
said
Aragog
slowly
think
not
But
but
sons
and
daughters
not
harm
Hagrid
command
But
cannot
deny
them
fresh
meat
when
wanders
willingly
into
our
midst
Good
bye
friend
Hagrid
Harry
spun
around
Feet
away
towering
above
him
was
solid
wall
spiders
clicking
their
many
eyes
gleaming
their
ugly
black
heads
Even
reached
for
his
wand
Harry
knew
was
good
there
were
too
many
them
but
tried
stand
ready
die
fighting
loud
long
note
sounded
and
blaze
light
flamed
through
the
hollow
Weasley
car
was
thundering
down
the
slope
headlights
glaring
its
horn
screeching
knocking
spiders
aside
several
were
thrown
onto
their
backs
their
endless
legs
waving
the
air
The
car
screeched
halt
front
Harry
and
Ron
and
the
doors
flew
open
Get
Fang
Harry
yelled
diving
into
the
front
seat
Ron
seized
the
boarhound
around
the
middle
and
threw
him
yelping
into
the
back
the
car
the
doors
slammed
shut
Ron
didn
touch
the
accelerator
but
the
car
didn
need
him
the
engine
roared
and
they
were
off
hitting
more
spiders
They
sped
the
slope
out
the
hollow
and
they
were
soon
crashing
through
the
forest
branches
whipping
the
windows
the
car
wound
its
way
cleverly
through
the
widest
gaps
following
path
obviously
knew
Harry
looked
sideways
Ron
His
mouth
was
still
open
the
silent
scream
but
his
eyes
weren
popping
anymore
Are
you
okay
Ron
stared
straight
ahead
unable
speak
They
smashed
their
way
through
the
undergrowth
Fang
howling
loudly
the
back
seat
and
Harry
saw
the
side
mirror
snap
off
they
squeezed
past
large
oak
After
ten
noisy
rocky
minutes
the
trees
thinned
and
Harry
could
again
see
patches
sky
The
car
stopped
suddenly
that
they
were
nearly
thrown
into
the
windshield
They
had
reached
the
edge
the
forest
Fang
flung
himself
the
window
his
anxiety
get
out
and
when
Harry
opened
the
door
shot
off
through
the
trees
Hagrid
house
tail
between
his
legs
Harry
got
out
too
and
after
minute
Ron
seemed
regain
the
feeling
his
limbs
and
followed
still
stiff
necked
and
staring
Harry
gave
the
car
grateful
pat
reversed
back
into
the
forest
and
disappeared
from
view
Harry
went
back
into
Hagrid
cabin
get
the
Invisibility
Cloak
Fang
was
trembling
under
blanket
his
basket
When
Harry
got
outside
again
found
Ron
being
violently
sick
the
pumpkin
patch
Follow
the
spiders
said
Ron
weakly
wiping
his
mouth
his
sleeve
never
forgive
Hagrid
lucky
alive
bet
thought
Aragog
wouldn
hurt
friends
his
said
Harry
That
exactly
Hagrid
problem
said
Ron
thumping
the
wall
the
cabin
always
thinks
monsters
aren
bad
they
280
made
out
and
look
where
got
him
cell
Azkaban
was
shivering
uncontrollably
now
What
was
the
point
sending
there
What
have
found
out
like
know
That
Hagrid
never
opened
the
Chamber
Secrets
said
Harry
throwing
the
cloak
over
Ron
and
prodding
him
the
arm
make
him
walk
was
innocent
Ron
gave
loud
snort
Evidently
hatching
Aragog
cupboard
wasn
his
idea
being
innocent
the
castle
loomed
nearer
Harry
twitched
the
cloak
make
sure
their
feet
were
hidden
then
pushed
the
creaking
front
doors
ajar
They
walked
carefully
back
across
the
entrance
hall
and
the
marble
staircase
holding
their
breath
they
passed
corridors
where
watchful
sentries
were
walking
last
they
reached
the
safety
the
Gryffindor
common
room
where
the
fire
had
burned
itself
into
glowing
ash
They
took
off
the
cloak
and
climbed
the
winding
stair
their
dormitory
Ron
fell
onto
his
bed
without
bothering
get
undressed
Harry
however
didn
feel
very
sleepy
sat
the
edge
his
fourposter
thinking
hard
about
everything
Aragog
had
said
The
creature
that
was
lurking
somewhere
the
castle
thought
sounded
like
sort
monster
Voldemort
even
other
monsters
didn
want
name
But
and
Ron
were
closer
finding
out
what
was
how
Petrified
its
victims
Even
Hagrid
had
never
known
what
was
the
Chamber
Secrets
Harry
swung
his
legs
onto
his
bed
and
leaned
back
against
his
pillows
watching
the
moon
glinting
him
through
the
tower
window
couldn
see
what
else
they
could
They
had
hit
dead
ends
281
everywhere
Riddle
had
caught
the
wrong
person
the
Heir
Slytherin
had
got
off
and
one
could
tell
whether
was
the
same
person
different
one
who
had
opened
the
Chamber
this
time
There
was
nobody
else
ask
Harry
lay
down
still
thinking
about
what
Aragog
had
said
was
becoming
drowsy
when
what
seemed
like
their
very
last
hope
occurred
him
and
suddenly
sat
bolt
upright
Ron
hissed
through
the
dark
Ron
Ron
woke
with
yelp
like
Fang
stared
wildly
around
and
saw
Harry
Ron
that
girl
who
died
Aragog
said
she
was
found
bathroom
said
Harry
ignoring
Neville
snufing
snores
from
the
corner
What
she
never
left
the
bathroom
What
she
still
there
Ron
rubbed
his
eyes
frowning
through
the
moonlight
And
then
understood
too
You
don
think
not
Moaning
Myrtle
those
times
were
that
bathroom
and
she
was
just
three
toilets
away
said
Ron
bitterly
breakfast
next
day
and
could
asked
her
and
now
had
been
hard
enough
trying
look
for
spiders
Escaping
their
teachers
long
enough
sneak
into
girls
bathroom
the
girls
bathroom
moreover
right
next
the
scene
the
first
attack
was
going
almost
impossible
But
something
happened
their
first
lesson
Transfiguration
that
drove
the
Chamber
Secrets
out
their
minds
for
the
first
time
weeks
Ten
minutes
into
the
class
Professor
McGonagall
told
them
that
their
exams
would
start
the
first
June
one
week
from
today
Exams
howled
Seamus
Finnigan
still
getting
exams
There
was
loud
bang
behind
Harry
Neville
Longbottom
wand
slipped
vanishing
one
the
legs
his
desk
Professorr
McGonagall
restored
with
wave
her
own
wand
and
turned
frowning
Seamus
The
whole
point
keeping
the
school
open
this
time
for
you
receive
your
education
she
said
sternly
The
exams
will
therefore
take
place
usual
and
trust
you
are
all
studying
hard
Studying
hard
had
never
occurred
Harry
that
there
would
exams
with
the
castle
this
state
There
was
great
deal
mutinous
muttering
around
the
room
which
made
Professor
McGonagall
scowl
even
more
darkly
Professor
Dumbledore
instructions
were
keep
the
school
running
normally
possible
she
said
And
that
need
hardly
point
out
means
finding
out
how
much
you
have
learned
this
year
Harry
looked
down
the
pair
white
rabbits
was
supposed
turning
into
slippers
What
had
learned
far
this
year
couldn
seem
think
anything
that
would
useful
exam
Ron
looked
though
just
been
told
had
and
live
the
Forbidden
Forest
Can
you
imagine
taking
exams
with
this
asked
Harry
holding
his
wand
which
had
just
started
whistling
loudly
Three
days
before
their
first
exam
Professor
McGonagall
made
another
announcement
breakfast
have
good
news
she
said
and
the
Great
Hall
instead
falling
silent
erupted
Dumbledore
coming
back
several
people
yelled
joyfully
You
caught
the
Heir
Slytherin
squealed
girl
the
Ravenclaw
table
284
Quidditch
matches
are
back
roared
Wood
excitedly
When
the
hubbub
had
subsided
Professor
McGonagall
said
Professor
Sprout
has
informed
that
the
Mandrakes
are
ready
for
cutting
last
Tonight
will
able
revive
those
people
who
have
been
Petrified
need
hardly
remind
you
all
that
one
them
may
well
able
tell
who
what
attacked
them
hopeful
that
this
dreadful
year
will
end
with
our
catching
the
culprit
There
was
explosion
cheering
Harry
looked
over
the
Slytherin
table
and
wasn
all
surprised
see
that
Draco
Malfoy
hadn
joined
Ron
however
was
looking
happier
than
looked
days
won
matter
that
never
asked
Myrtle
then
said
Harry
Hermione

all
the
answers

they
wake
her
Mind

when
she
finds
out
got
exams
three
days
time
She
hasn
studied
might
kinder
leave
her
where
she
till
they
over
Just
then
Ginny
Weasley
came
over
and
sat
down
next
Ron
She
looked
tense
and
nervous
and
Harry
noticed
that
her
hands
were
twisting
her
lap
What
said
Ron
helping
himself
more
porridge
Ginny
didn
say
anything
but
glanced
and
down
the
Gryffindor
table
with
scared
look
her
face
that
reminded
Harry
someone
though
couldn
think
who
Spit
out
said
Ron
watching
her
Harry
suddenly
realized
who
Ginny
looked
like
She
was
rocking
backward
and
forward
slightly
her
chair
exactly
like
Dobby
did
when
was
teetering
the
edge
revealing
forbidden
information
got
tell
you
something
Ginny
mumbled
carefully
not
looking
Harry
What
said
Harry
Ginny
looked
though
she
couldn
find
the
right
words
What
said
Ron
Ginny
opened
her
mouth
but
sound
came
out
Harry
leaned
forward
and
spoke
quietly
that
only
Ginny
and
Ron
could
hear
him
something
about
the
Chamber
Secrets
Have
you
seen
something
Someone
acting
oddly
Ginny
drew
deep
breath
and
that
precise
moment
Percy
Weasley
appeared
looking
tired
and
wan
you
finished
eating
take
that
seat
Ginny
starving
only
just
come
off
patrol
duty
Ginny
jumped
though
her
chair
had
just
been
electrified
gave
Percy
fleeting
frightened
look
and
scampered
away
Percy
sat
down
and
grabbed
mug
from
the
center
the
table
Percy
said
Ron
angrily
She
was
just
about
tell
some
thing
important
Halfway
through
gulp
tea
Percy
choked
What
sort
thing
said
coughing
just
asked
her
she
seen
anything
odd
and
she
started
say
that
that
nothing
with
the
Chamber
Secrets
said
Percy
once
How
you
know
said
Ron
his
eyebrows
raised
Well
you
must
know
Ginny
walked
the
other
day
when
was
well
never
mind
the
point
she
spot
ted
doing
something
and
asked
her
not
mention
anybody

say

think
she
keep
her
word

just
rather
Harry
had
never
seen
Percy
look
uncomfortable
What
were

Percy
said
Ron
grinning
tell
won
laugh
Percy
didn
smile
back
Pass

Harry
knew
the
whole
mystery
might
solved
tomorrow
without
their
help
but
wasn
about

Myrtle
turned
and
his
delight
did
midmorning
when
they
were
being
led
History
Magic
Gilderoy
Lockhart
Lockhart
who
had
often
assured
them
that
all
danger
had
passed
only
proved
wrong
right
away
was
now
wholeheartedly
convinced
that
was
hardly
worth
the
trouble
see
them
safely
down
the
corridors
His
hair
wasn
sleek
usual
seemed
had
been
most
the
night
patrolling
the
fourth
floor
Mark
words
said
ushering
them
around
corner
The
first
words
out
those
poor
Petrified
people
mouths
will
was
Hagrid
Frankly
astounded
Professor
McGonagall
thinks
all
these
security
measures
are
necessary
agree
sir
said
Harry
making
Ron
drop
his
books
surprise
Thank
you
Harry
said
Lockhart
graciously
while
they
waited
for
long
line
Hufflepuffs
pass
mean
teachers
have
quite
enough
getting
with
without
walking
students
classes
and
standing
guard
all
night
That
right
said
Ron
catching
Why
don
you
leave
here
sir
only
got
one
more
corridor
You
know
Weasley
think
will
said
Lockhart
really
should
and
prepare
next
class
And
hurried
off
Prepare
his
class
Ron
sneered
after
him
Gone
curl
his
hair
more
like
They
let
the
rest
the
Gryffindors
draw
ahead
them
then
darted
down
side
passage
and
hurried
off
toward
Moaning
Myrtle
bathroom
But
just
they
were
congratulating
each
other
their
brilliant
scheme
Potter
Weasley
What
are
you
doing
was
Professor
McGonagall
and
her
mouth
was
the
thinnest
thin
lines
were
were
Ron
stammered
were
going
and
see
Hermione
said
Harry
Ron
and
Professor
McGonagall
both
looked
him
haven
seen
her
for
ages
Professor
Harry
went
hurriedly
treading
Ron
foot
and
thought
sneak
into
the
hospital
wing
you
know
and
tell
her
the
Mandrakes
are
nearly
ready
and
not
worry
Professor
McGonagall
was
still
staring
him
and
for
moment
Harry
thought
she
was
going
explode
but
when
she
spoke
was
strangely
croaky
voice
course
she
said
and
Harry
amazed
saw
tear
glistening
her
beady
eye
course
realize
this
has
all
been
hardest
the
friends
those
who
have
been
quite
understand
Yes
Potter
course
you
may
visit
Miss
Granger
will
inform
Professor
Binns
where
you
gone
Tell
Madam
Pomfrey
have
given
permission
Harry
and
Ron
walked
away
hardly
daring
believe
that
they
avoided
detention
they
turned
the
corner
they
distinctly
heard
Professor
McGonagall
blow
her
nose
That
said
Ron
fervently
was
the
best
story
you
ever
come
with
They
had
choice
now
but
the
hospital
wing
and
tell
Madam
Pomfrey
that
they
had
Professor
McGonagall
permission
visit
Hermione
Madam
Pomfrey
let
them
but
reluctantly
There
just
point
talking
Petrified
person
she
said
and
they
had
admit
she
had
point
when
they
taken
their
seats
next
Hermione
was
plain
that
Hermione
didn
have
the
faintest
inkling
that
she
had
visitors
and
that
they
might
just
well
tell
her
bedside
cabinet
not
worry
for
all
the
good
would
Wonder
she
did
see
the
attacker
though
said
Ron
looking
sadly
Hermione
rigid
face
Because
sneaked
them
all
one
ever
know
But
Harry
wasn
looking
Hermione
face
was
more
interested
her
right
hand
lay
clenched
top
her
blankets
and
bending
closer
saw
that
piece
paper
was
scrunched
inside
her
fist
Making
sure
that
Madam
Pomfrey
was
nowhere
near
pointed
this
out
Ron
and
get
out
Ron
whispered
shifting
his
chair
that
blocked
Harry
from
Madam
Pomfrey
view
was
easy
task
Hermione
hand
was
clamped
tightly
around
the
paper
that
Harry
was
sure
was
going
tear
While
Ron
kept
watch
tugged
and
twisted
and
last
after
several
tense
minutes
the
paper
came
free
was
page
torn
from
very
old
library
book
Harry
smoothed
out
eagerly
and
Ron
leaned
close
read
too
the
many
fearsome
beasts
and
monsters
that
roam
our
land
there
none
more
curious
more
deadly
than
the
Basilisk
known
also
the
King
Serpents
This
snake
which
may
reach
gigantic
size
and
live
many
hundreds
years
born
from
chicken
egg
hatched
beneath
toad
Its
methods
killing
are
most
wondrous
for
aside
from
its
deadly
and
venomous
fangs
the
Basilisk
has
murderous
stare
and
all
who
are
fixed
with
the
beam
its
eye
shall
suffer
instant
death
Spiders
flee
before
the
Basilisk
for
their
mortal
enemy
and
the
Basilisk
flees
only
from
the
crowing
the
rooster
which

And
beneath
this
single
word
had
been
written

Harry
recognized
Hermione
Pipes
was
though
somebody
had
just
flicked
light
his
brain
Ron
breathed
This
This
the
answer
The
monster
the
Chamber
basilisk
giant
serpent
That
why
been
hearing
that
voice
all
over
the
place
and
nobody
else
has
heard
because
understand
Parseltongue
Harry
looked
the
beds
around
him
The
basilisk
kills
people
looking
them
But
one
died
because
one
looked
straight
the
eye
Colin
saw
through
his
camera
The
basilisk
burned
all
the
film
inside
but
Colin
just
got
Petrified
Justin
Justin
must
seen
the
basilisk
through
Nearly
Headless
Nick
Nick
got
the
full
blast
but
couldn
die
again
and
Hermione
and
that
Ravenclaw
prefect
were
found
with
mirror
next
them
Hermione
had
just
realized
the
monster
was
basilisk
bet
you
anything
she
warned
the
first
person
she
met
look
around
corners
with
mirror
first
And
that
girl
pulled
out
her
mirror
and
Rods
jaw
had
dropped
And
Mrs
Norris
whispered
eagerly
Harry
thought
hard
picturing
the
scene
the
night
Halloween
The
water
said
slowly
The
flood
from
Moaning
Myrtle
bathroom
bet
you
Mrs
Norris
only
saw
the
reflection
scanned
the
page
his
hand
eagerly
The
more
looked
the
more
made
sense
The
crowing
the
rooster
fatal
read
aloud
Hagrid
roosters
were
killed
The
Heir
Slytherin
didn
want
one
anywhere
near
the
castle

the
Chamber
was
opened

before
all

But
how

Someone

scribbled

Ron

using
the
plumbing

hearing
that
voice
inside
the
walls

Ron
suddenly
grabbed
Harry
arm
The
entrance
the
Chamber
Secrets
said
hoarsely
What

What
Moaning
Myrtle

said
Harry
They
sat
there
excitement
coursing
through
them
hardly
able
believe
This
means

Harry

only
Parselmouth

Let

Harry

She

minutes
nearly
break
They
ran
downstairs
Not
wanting
discovered
hanging
around
another
corridor
they
went
straight
into
the
deserted
staff
room
was
large
paneled
room
full
dark
wooden
chairs
Harry
and
Ron
paced
around
too
excited
sit
down
But
the
bell
signal
break
never
came
Instead
echoing
through
the
corridors
came
Professor
McGon
agall
voice
magically
magnified
All
students

House

All

Immediately

Harry
wheeled
around

Ron
Not

Not

What

Ron
aghast
back
the
dormitory
said
Harry
glancing
around
There

ugly

full
the
teachers
cloaks
here
Let
hear
what
all

Then

tell
them
what
found
out
They
hid
themselves
inside
listening
the
rumbling
hundreds
people
moving
overhead
and
the
staff
room
door
banging
open
From
between
the
musty
folds
the
cloaks
they
watched
the
teachers
filtering
into
the
room
Some
them
were
looking
puzzled
others
downright
scared
Then
Professor
McGonagall
arrived
has
happened
she
told
the
silent
staff
room
student
has
been
taken
the
monster
Right
into
the
Chamber
itself
Professor
Flitwick
let
out
squeal
Professor
Sprout
clapped
her
hands
over
her
mouth
Snape
gripped
the
back
chair
very
hard
and
said
How
can
you
sure
The
Heir
Slytherin
said
Professor
McGonagall
who
was
very
white
left
another
message
Right
underneath
the
first
one
Her
skeleton
will
lie
the
Chamber
forever
Professor
Flitwick
burst
into
tears
Who
said
Madam
Hooch
who
had
sunk
weak
kneed
into
chair
Which
student
Ginny
Weasley
said
Professor
McGonagall
Harry
felt
Ron
slide
silently
down
onto
the
wardrobe
floor
beside
him

have
send
all
the
students
home
tomorrow
said
Professor
McGonagall
This
the
end
Hogwarts
Dumbledore
always
said
The
staffroom
door
banged
open
again
For
one
wild
moment
Harry
was
sure
would
Dumbledore
But
was
Lockhart
and
was
beaming
sorry
dozed
off
what
have
missed
didn
seem
notice
that
the
other
teachers
were
looking
him
with
something
remarkably
like
hatred
Snape
stepped
forward
Just
the
man
said
The
very
man
girl
has
been
snatched
the
monster
Lockhart
Taken
into
the
Chamber
Secrets
itself
Your
moment
has
come
last
Lockhart
blanched
That
right
Gilderoy
chipped
Professor
Sprout
Weren
you
saying
just
last
night
that
you
known
all
along
where
the
entrance
the
Chamber
Secrets
well
sputtered
Lockhart
Yes
didn
you
tell
you
were
sure
you
knew
what
was
inside
piped
Professor
Flitwick
did
don
recall
certainly
remember
you
saying
you
were
sorry
you
hadn
had
crack
the
monster
before
Hagrid
was
arrested
said
Snape
Didn
you
say
that
the
whole
affair
had
been
bungled
and
that
you
should
have
been
given
free
rein
from
the
first
Lockhart
stared
around
his
stony
faced
colleagues
really
never
you
may
have
misunderstood
leave
you
then
Gilderoy
said
Professor
McGonagall
Tonight
will
excellent
time
make
sure
everyone
out
your
way
You
able
tackle
the
monster
all
youself
free
rein
last
Lockhart
gazed
desperately
around
him
but
nobody
came
the
rescue
didn
look
remotely
handsome
anymore
His
lip
was
trembling
and
the
absence
his
usually
toothy
grin
looked
weak
chinned
and
feeble
very
well
said
office
getting
getting
ready
And
left
the
room
Right
said
Professor
McGonagall
whose
nostrils
were
flared
that
got
him
out
from
under
our
feet
The
Heads
Houses
should
and
inform
their
students
what
has
happened
Tell
them
the
Hogwarts
Express
will
take
them
home
first
thing
tomorrow
Will
the
rest
you
please
make
sure
students
have
been
left
outside
their
dormitories
The
teachers
rose
and
left
one
one
was
probably
the
worst
day
Harry
entire
life
Ron
Fred
and
George
sat
together
corner
the
Gryffindor
common
room
unable
say
anything
each
other
Percy
wasn
there
had
gone
send
owl
and
Mrs
Weasley
then
shut
himself
his
dormitory
afternoon
ever
lasted
long
that
one
nor
had
Gryffindor
Tower
ever
been
crowded
yet
quiet
Near
sunset
Fred
and
George
went
bed
unable
sit
there
any
longer
She
knew
something
Harry
said
Ron
speaking
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
entered
the
wardrobe
the
staff
room
That
why
she
was
taken
wasn
some
stupid
thing
about
Percy
all
She
found
out
something
about
the
Chamber
Secrets
That
must
why
she
was
Ron
rubbed
his
eyes
frantically
mean
she
was
pure
blood
There
can
any
other
reason
Harry
could
see
the
sun
sinking
blood
red
below
the
skyline
This
was
the
worst
had
ever
felt
only
there
was
something
they
could
Anything
Harry
said
Ron
you
think
there
any
chance
all
she
not
you
know
Harry
didn
know
what
say
couldn
see
how
Ginny
could
still
alive
you
know
what
said
Ron
think
should
and
see
295
Lockhart
Tell
him
what
know
going
try
and
get
into
the
Chamber
can
tell
him
where
think
and
tell
him
basilisk
there
Because
Harry
couldn
think
anything
else
and
because
wanted
doing
something
agreed
The
Gryffindors
around
them
were
miserable
and
felt
sorry
for
the
Weasleys
that
nobody
tried
stop
them
they
got
crossed
the
room
and
left
through
the
portrait
hole
Darkness
was
falling
they
walked
down
Lockhart
office
There
seemed
lot
activity
going
inside
They
could
hear
scraping
thumps
and
hurried
footsteps
Harry
knocked
and
there
was
sudden
silence
from
inside
Then
the
door
opened
the
tiniest
crack
and
they
saw
one
Lockhart
eyes
peering
through
Potter
Weasley
said
opening
the
door
bit
wider
rather
busy
the
moment
you
would
quick
Professor
got
some
information
for
you
said
Harry
think
help
you
well
not
terribly
The
side
Lockhart
face
that
they
could
see
looked
very
uncomfortable
mean
well
all
right
opened
the
door
and
they
entered
His
office
had
been
almost
completely
stripped
Two
large
trunks
stood
open
the
floor
Robes
jade
green
lilac
midnightblue
had
been
hastily
folded
into
one
them
books
were
jumbled
untidily
into
the
other
The
photographs
that
had
covered
the
walls
were
now
crammed
into
boxes
the
desk
296
Are
you
going
somewhere
said
Harry
well
yes
said
Lockhart
ripping
life
size
poster
himself
from
the
back
the
door
spoke
and
starting
roll
Urgent
call
unavoidable

What

sister
said
Ron
jerkily
Well
that
most
unfortunate
said
Lockhart
avoiding
their
eyes
wrenched
open
drawer
and
started
emptying
the
contents
into
bag
one
regrets
more
than
You
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
said
Harry
You
can
now
Not
with
all
the
Dark
stuff
going
here
Well
must
say

took
the
job
Lockhart
muttered
now
piling
socks
top
his
robes
nothing
the
job
description
didn
expect
You
mean
you
running
away
said
Harry
disbelievingly
After
all
that
stuff
you
did
your
books
Books

said
Lockhart
delicately
You
wrote
them
Harry
shouted
dear
boy
said
Lockhart
straightening
and
frowning
Harry
use
your
common
sense
books
wouldn
have
sold
half
well
people
didn
think
done
all
those
things
one
wants

about
some
ugly
old
Armenian
warlock

And

Banshee

taking
credit
for
what
load

people

said
Harry
incredulously
Harry
Harry
said
Lockhart
shaking
his
head
impatiently
not
nearly
simple
that
There
was
work
involved
had
297
track
these
people
down
Ask
them
exactly
how
they
managed

Then

Harry

You

prepared
for
long
hard
slog
banged
the
lids
his
trunks
shut
and
locked
them
Let
see
said
think
that
everything
Yes
Only
one
thing
left
pulled
out
his
wand
and
turned
them
Awfully
sorry
boys
but
have
put
Memory
Charm
you
now
Can
have
you
blabbing
secrets
all
over
the
place
never
sell

Harry
reached
his
wand
just
time
Lockhart
had
barely
raised
his
when
Harry
bellowed
Expelliarmus
Lockhart
was
blasted
backward
falling
over
his
trunk
his
wand
flew
high
into
the
air
Ron
caught
and
flung
out
the
open
window
Shouldn
have
let
Professor
Snape
teach
that
one
said
Harry
furiously
kicking
Lockhart
trunk
aside
Lockhart
was
looking
him
feeble
once
more
Harry
was
still
pointing
his
wand
him
What
you
want
said
Lockhart
weakly
don
know
where
the
Chamber
Secrets
There
nothing
can
You

Harry
forcing
Lockhart
his
feet
wandpoint

where
And
what
inside
Let
298
They
marched
Lockhart
out
his
office
and
down
the
nearest
stairs
along
the
dark
corridor
where
the
messages
shone
the
wall
the
door
Moaning
Myrtle
bathroom
They
sent
Lockhart
first
Harry
was
pleased
see
that
was
shaking
Moaning
Myrtle
was
sitting
the
tank
the
end
toilet
you
she
said
when
she
saw
Harry
What
you
want
this
time
ask
you
how
you
died
said
Harry
Myrtle
whole
aspect
changed
once
She
looked
though
she
had
never
been
asked
such
flattering
question
Ooooh
was
dreadful
she
said
with
relish
happened
right
here
died
this
very
stall
remember
well
hidden
because
Olive
Hornby
was
teasing
about
glasses
The
door
was
locked
and
was
crying
and
then
heard
somebody
come
They
said
something
funny
different
language
think
must
have
been
Anyway
what
really
got
was
that
was
boy
speaking
unlocked
the
door
tell
him
and
use
his
own
toilet
and
then
Myrtle
swelled
importantly
her
face
shining
died
How

Myrtle
hushed
tones
just
remember
seeing
pair
great
big
yellow
eyes

seized
and
then
was
floating
away
She
looked
dreamily

And
then

you
see
the
eyes
said
Harry
299
Somewhere
there
said
Myrtle
pointing
vaguely
toward
the
sink
front
her
toilet
Harry
and
Ron
hurried
over
Lockhart
was
standing
well
back
look
utter
terror
his
face
looked
like
ordinary
sink
They
examined
every
inch
inside
and
out
including
the
pipes
below
And
then
Harry
saw
Scratched
the
side
one
the
copper
taps
was
tiny
snake
That
tap
never
worked
said
Myrtle
brightly
tried
turn
Harry
said
Ron
Say
something
Something
Parseltongue
But
Harry
thought
hard
The
only
times
ever
managed
speak
Parseltongue
were
when
been
faced
with
real
snake
stared
hard
the
tiny
engraving
trying
imagine
was
real
Open
said
looked
Ron
who
shook
his
head
English
said
Harry
looked
back
the
snake
willing
himself
believe
was
alive
moved
his
head
the
candlelight
made
look
though
were
moving
Open
said
Except
that
the
words
weren
what
heard
strange
hissing
had
escaped
him
and
once
the
tap
glowed
with
brilliant
white
light
and
began
spin
Next
second
the
sink
began
move
the
sink
fact
sank
right
out
sight
leaving
large
pipe
exposed
pipe
wide
enough
for
man
slide
into
Harry
heard
Ron
gasp
and
looked
again
had
made
his
mind
what
was
going
300
going
down
there
said
couldn
not
not
now
they
had
found
the
entrance
the
Chamber
not
there
was
even
the
faintest
slimmest
wildest
chance
that
Ginny
might
alive
too
said
Ron
There
was
pause
Well
you
hardly
seem
need
said
Lockhart
with
shadow
his
old
smile
just
put
his
hand
the
door
knob
but
Ron
and
Harry
both
pointed
their
wands
him
You
can
first
Ron
snarled
White
faced
and
wandless
Lockhart
approached
the
opening
Boys
said
his
voice
feeble
Boys
what
good
will
Harry
jabbed
him
the
back
with
his
wand
Lockhart
slid
his
legs
into
the
pipe
really
don
think
started
say
but
Ron
gave
him
push
and
slid
out
sight
Harry
followed
quickly
lowered
himself
slowly
into
the
pipe
then
let
was
like
rushing
down
endless
slimy
dark
slide
could
see
more
pipes
branching
off
all
directions
but
none
large
theirs
which
twisted
and
turned
sloping
steeply
downward
and
knew
that
was
falling
deeper
below
the
school
than
even
the
dungeons
Behind
him
could
hear
Ron
thudding
slightly
the
curves
And
then
just
had
begun
worry
about
what
would
happen
when
hit
the
ground
the
pipe
leveled
out
and
shot
out
the
end
with
wet
thud
landing
the
damp
floor
dark
stone
tunnel
large
enough
stand
Lockhart
was
getting
his
301
feet
little
ways
away
covered
slime
and
white
ghost
Harry
stood
aside
Ron
came
whizzing
out
the
pipe
too
must
miles
under
the
school
said
Harry
his
voice
echoing
the
black
tunnel
Under
the
lake
probably
said
Ron
squinting
around
the
dark
slimy
walls
All
three
them
turned
stare
into
the
darkness
ahead
Lumos
Harry
muttered
his
wand
and
lit
again
mon
said
Ron
and
Lockhart
and
off
they
went
their
footsteps
slapping
loudly
the
wet
floor
The
tunnel
was
dark
that
they
could
only
see
little
distance
ahead
Their
shadows
the
wet
walls
looked
monstrous
the
wandlight
Remember
Harry
said
quietly
they
walked
cautiously
forward
any
sign
movement
close
your
eyes
right
away
But
the
tunnel
was
quiet
the
grave
and
the
first
unexpected
sound
they
heard
was
loud
crunch
Ron
stepped
what
turned
out
rat
skull
Harry
lowered
his
wand
look
the
floor
and
saw
that
was
littered
with
small
animal
bones
Trying
very
hard
not
imagine
what
Ginny
might
look
like
they
found
her
Harry
led
the
way
forward
around
dark
bend
the
tunnel
Harry
there
something
there
said
Ron
hoarsely
grabbing
Harry
shoulder
They
froze
watching
Harry
could
just
see
the
outline
something
huge
and
curved
lying
right
across
the
tunnel
wasn
moving
Maybe
asleep
breathed
glancing
back
the
other
two
Lockhart
hands
were
pressed
over
his
eyes
Harry
turned
back
look
the
thing
his
heart
beating
fast
hurt
302
Very
slowly
his
eyes
narrow
could
make
them
and
still
see
Harry
edged
forward
his
wand
held
high
The
light
slid
over
gigantic
snake
skin
vivid
poisonous
green
lying
curled
and
empty
across
the
tunnel
floor
The
creature
that
had
shed
must
have
been
twenty
feet
long
least
Blimey
said
Ron
weakly
There
was
sudden
movement
behind
them
Gilderoy
Lockhart
knees
had
given
way
Get
said
Ron
sharply
pointing
his
wand
Lockhart
Lockhart
got
his
feet
then
dived
Ron
knocking
him
the
ground
Harry
jumped
forward
but
too
late
Lockhart
was
straightening
panting
Ron
wand
his
hand
and
gleaming
smile
back
his
face
The
adventure
ends
here
boys
said
shall
take
bit
this
skin
back
the
school
tell
them
was
too
late
save
the
girl
and
that
you
two
tragically
lost
your
minds
the
sight
her
mangled
body
say
good
bye
your
memories
raised
Ron
Spellotaped
wand
high
over
his
head
and
yelled
Obliviate
The
wand
exploded
with
the
force
small
bomb
Harry
flung
his
arms
over
his
head
and
ran
slipping
over
the
coils
snake
skin
out
the
way
great
chunks
tunnel
ceiling
that
were
thundering
the
floor
Next
moment
was
standing
alone
gazing
solid
wall
broken
rock
Ron
shouted
Are
you
okay
Ron
here
came
Ron
muffled
voice
from
behind
the
rockfall
okay
this
git
not
though
got
blasted
the
wand
303
There
was
dull
thud
and
loud
sounded
though
Ron
had
just
kicked
Lockhart
the
shins
What
now
Ron
voice
said
sounding
desperate
can
get
through
take
ages
Harry
looked
the
tunnel
ceiling
Huge
cracks
had
appeared
had
never
tried
break
apart
anything
large
these
rocks
magic
and
now
didn
seem
good
moment
try
what
the
whole
tunnel
caved
There
was
another
thud
and
another
from
behind
the
rocks
They
were
wasting
time
Ginny
had
already
been
the
Chamber
Secrets
for
hours
Harry
knew
there
was
only
one
thing
Wait
there
called
Ron
Wait
with
Lockhart
not
back
hour
There
was
very
pregnant
pause
try
and
shift
some
this
rock
said
Ron
who
seemed
trying
keep
his
voice
steady
you
can
can
get
back
through
And
Harry
See
you
bit
said
Harry
trying
inject
some
confidence
into
his
shaking
voice
And
set
off
alone
past
the
giant
snake
skin
Soon
the
distant
noise
Ron
straining
shift
the
rocks
was
gone
The
tunnel
turned
and
turned
again
Every
nerve
Harry
body
was
tingling
unpleasantly
wanted
the
tunnel
end
yet
dreaded
what
find
when
did
And
then
last
crept
around
yet
another
bend
saw
solid
wall
ahead
which
two
entwined
serpents
were
carved
their
eyes
set
with
great
glinting
emeralds
304
Harry
approached
his
throat
very
dry
There
was
need
pretend
these
stone
snakes
were
real
their
eyes
looked
strangely
alive
could
guess
what
had
cleared
his
throat
and
the
emerald
eyes
seemed
flicker
Open
said
Harry
low
faint
hiss
The
serpents
parted
the
wall
cracked
open
the
halves
slid
smoothly
out
sight
and
Harry
shaking
from
head
foot
walked
inside
was
standing
the
end
very
long
dimly
lit
chamber
Towering
stone
pillars
entwined
with
more
carved
serpents
rose
support
ceiling
lost
darkness
casting
long
black
shadows
through
the
odd
greenish
gloom
that
filled
the
place
His
heart
beating
very
fast
Harry
stood
listening
the
chill
silence
Could
the
basilisk
lurking
shadowy
corner
behind
pillar
And
where
was
Ginny
pulled
out
his
wand
and
moved
forward
between
the
serpentine
columns
Every
careful
footstep
echoed
loudly
off
the
shadowy
walls
kept
his
eyes
narrowed
ready
clamp
them
shut
the
smallest
sign
movement
The
hollow
eye
sockets
the
stone
snakes
seemed
following
him
More
than
once
with
jolt
the
stomach
thought
saw
one
stir
Then
drew
level
with
the
last
pair
pillars
statue
high
the
Chamber
itself
loomed
into
view
standing
against
the
back
wall
306
Harry
had
crane
his
neck
look
into
the
giant
face
above
was
ancient
and
monkeyish
with
long
thin
beard
that
fell
almost
the
bottom
the
wizard
sweeping
stone
robes
where
two
enormous
gray
feet
stood
the
smooth
Chamber
floor
And
between
the
feet
facedown
lay
small
black
robed
figure
with
flaming
red
hair
tinny
Harry
muttered
sprinting
her
and
dropping
his
knees
tinny
don
dead
please
don
dead
flung
his
wand
aside
grabbed
Ginny
shoulders
and
turned
her
over
Her
face
was
white
marble
and
cold
yet
her
eyes
were
closed
she
wasn
Petrified
But
then
she
must
Ginny
please
wake
Harry
muttered
desperately
shaking
her
Ginny
head
lolled
hopelessly
from
side
side
She
won
wake
said
soft
voice
Harry
jumped
and
spun
around
his
knees
tall
black
haired
boy
was
leaning
against
the
nearest
pillar
watching
was
strangely
blurred
around
the
edges
though
Harry
were
looking
him
through
misted
window
But
there
was
mistaking
him
Tom
Tom
Riddle
Riddle
nodded
not
taking
his
eyes
off
Harry
face
What
you
mean
she
won
wake
Harry
said
desperately
She
not
she
not
She
still
alive
said
Riddle
But
only
just
Harry
stared
him
Tom
Riddle
had
been
Hogwarts
fifty
years
ago
yet
here
stood
weird
misty
light
shining
about
him
not
day
older
than
sixteen
Are
you
ghost
Harry
said
uncertainly
memory
said
Riddle
quietly
Preserved
diary
for
fifty
years
pointed
toward
the
floor
near
the
statue
giant
toes
Lying
open
there
was
the
little
black
diary
Harry
had
found
Moaning
Myrtle
bathroom
For
second
Harry
wondered
how
had
got
there
but
there
were
more
pressing
matters
deal
with
You
got
help
Tom
Harry
said
raising
Ginny
head
again
got

her
out
here
There
basilisk
don
know
where
but
could
along
any
moment
Please

Riddle
didn
move
Harry
sweating
managed
hoist
Ginny
half
off
the
floor
and
bent
pick
his
wand
again
But
his
wand
had
gone
Did
you
see
looked
Riddle
was
still
watching
him
twirling
Harry
wand
between
his
long
fingers
Thanks
said
Harry
stretching
out
his
hand
for
smile
curled
the
corners
Riddle
mouth
continued
stare
Harry
twirling
the
wand
idly
Listen
said
Harry
urgently
his
knees
sagging
with
Ginny
dead
weight
got
the
basilisk
comes
won
come
until
called
said
Riddle
calmly
Harry
lowered
Ginny
back
onto
the
floor
unable
hold
her
any
longer
What
you
mean
said
Look
give
wand
might
need
Riddle
smile
broadened
You
won
needing
said
Harry
stared
him
What
you
mean
won
waited
long
time
for
this
Harry
Potter
said
Riddle
For
the
chance
see
you
speak
you
Look
said
Harry
losing
patience
don
think
you
get
the
Chamber
Secrets
can
talk
later
going
talk
now
said
Riddle
still
smiling
broadly
and
pocketed
Harry
wand
Harry
stared
him
There
was
something
very
funny
going
here
How
did
Ginny
get
like
this
asked
slowly
Well
that
interesting
question
said
Riddle
pleasantly
And
quite
long
story
suppose
the
real
reason
Ginny
Weasley
like
this
because
she
opened
her
heart
and
spilled
all
her
secrets
invisible
stranger
What
are
you
talking
about
said
Harry
The
diary
said
Riddle
diary
Little
Ginny
been
writing
for
months
and
months
telling
all
her
pitiful
worries
and
woes
how
her
brothers
tease
her
how
she
had
come
school
with
secondhand
robes
and
books
how
Riddle
eyes
glinted
how
she
didn
think
famous
good
great
Harry
Potter
would
ever
like
her
All
the
time
spoke
Riddle
eyes
never
left
Harry
face
There
was
almost
hungry
look
them
very
boring
having
listen
the
silly
little
troubles
eleven
year
old
girl
went
But
was
patient
wrote
back
was
sympathetic
was
kind
Ginny
simply
loved
one
ever
understood
like
you
Tom
glad
got
this
diary
309
confide
like
having
friend
can
carry
around
pocket
Riddle
laughed
high
cold
laugh
that
didn
suit
him
made
the
hairs
stand
the
back
Harry
neck
say
myself
Harry
always
been
able
charm
the
people
needed
Ginny
poured
out
her
soul
and
her
soul
happened
exactly
what
wanted
grew
stronger
and
stronger
diet
her
deepest
fears
her
darkest
secrets
grew
powerful
far
more
powerful
than
little
Miss
Weasley
Powerful
enough
start
feeding
Miss
Weasley
few
secrets
start
pouring
little
soul
back
into
her
What
you
mean
said
Harry
whose
mouth
had
gone
very
dry
Haven
you
guessed
yet
Harry
Potter
said
Riddle
softly
Ginny
Weasley
opened
the
Chamber
Secrets
She
strangled
the
school
roosters
and
daubed
threatening
messages
the
walls
She
set
the
Serpent
Slytherin
four
Mudbloods
and
the
Squib
cat
Harry
whispered
Yes
said
Riddle
calmly
course
she
didn
know
what
she
was
doing
first
was
very
amusing
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
new
diary
entries
far
more
interesting
they
became
Dear
Tom
recited
watching
Harry
horrified
face
think
losing
memory
There
are
rooster
feathers
all
over
robes
and
don
know
how
they
got
there
Dear
Tom
can
remember
what
did
the
night
Halloween
but
cat
was
attacked
and
got
paint
all
down
front
Dear
Tom
Percy
keeps
telling
pale
and
not
myself
think
suspects
There
was
another
attack
today
310
and
don
know
where
was
Tom
what
going
think
going
mad
think
the
one
attacking
everyone
Tom
Harry
fists
were
clenched
the
nails
digging
deep
into
his
Palms
took
very
long
time
for
stupid
little
Ginny
stop
trusting
her
diary
said
Riddle
But
she
finally
became
suspicious
and
tried
dispose
And
that
where
you
came
Harry
You
found
and
couldn
have
been
more
delighted
all
the
people
who
could
have
picked
was
you
the
very
person
was
most
anxious
meet
And
why
did
you
want
meet
said
Harry
Anger
was
coursing
through
him
and
was
effort
keep
his
voice
steady
Well
you
see
Ginny
told
all
about
you
Harry
said
Riddle
Your
whole
fascinating
history
His
eyes
roved
over
the
lightning
scar
Harry
forehead
and
their
expression
grew
hungrier
knew
must
find
out
more
about
you
talk
you
meet
you
could
decided
show
you
famous
capture
that
great
oaf
Hagrid
gain
your
trust
Hagrid
friend
said
Harry
his
voice
now
shaking
And
you
framed
him
didn
you
thought
you
made
mistake
but
Riddle
laughed
his
high
laugh
again
was
word
against
Hagrid
Harry
Well
you
can
imagine
how
looked
old
Armando
Dippet
the
one
hand
Tom
Riddle
poor
but
brilliant
parentless
but
brave
school
prefect
model
student
the
other
hand
big
blundering
Hagrid
trouble
every
other
week
trying
raise
werewolf
cubs
under
his
bed
sneaking
off
the
Forbidden
Forest
wrestle
trolls
but
admit
even
was
surprised
how
well
the
plan
worked
thought
someone
must
realize
that
Hagrid
couldn
possibly
the
Heir
Slytherin
had
taken
five
whole
years
find
out
everything
could
about
the
Chamber
Secrets
and
discover
the
secret
entrance
though
Hagrid
had
the
brains
the
power
Only
the
Transfiguration
teacher
Dumbledore
seemed
think
Hagrid
was
innocent
persuaded
Dipper
keep
Hagrid
and
train
him
gamekeeper
Yes
think
Dumbledore
might
have
guessed
Dumbledore
never
seemed
like
much
the
other
teachers
did
bet
Dumbledore
saw
right
through
you
said
Harry
his
teeth
gritted
Well
certainly
kept
annoyingly
close
watch
after
Hagrid
was
expelled
said
Riddle
carelessly
knew
wouldn
safe
open
the
Chamber
again
while
was
still
school
But
wasn
going
waste
those
long
years
spent
searching
for
decided
leave
behind
diary
preserving
sixteen
year
old
self
its
pages
that
one
day
with
luck
would
able
lead
another
footsteps
and
finish
Salazar
Slytherin
noble
work
Well
you
haven
finished
said
Harry
triumphantly
one
died
this
time
not
even
the
cat
few
hours
the
Mandrake
Draught
will
ready
and
everyone
who
was
Petrified
will
all
right
again
Haven
already
told
you
said
Riddle
quietly
that
killing
Mudbloods
doesn
matter
anymore
For
many
months
now
new
target
has
been
you
Harry
stared
him
Imagine
how
angry
was
when
the
next
time
diary
was
312
opened
was
Ginny
who
was
writing
not
you
She
saw
you
with
the
diary
you
see
and
panicked
What
you
found
out
how
work
and
repeated
all
her
secrets
you
What
even
worse
told
you
who
been
strangling
roosters
the
foolish
little
brat
waited
until
your
dormitory
was
deserted
and
stole
back
But
knew
what
must
was
clear
that
you
were
the
trail
Slytherin
heir
From
everything
Ginny
had
told
about
you
knew
you
would
any
lengths
solve
the
mystery
particularly
one
your
best
friends
was
attacked
And
Ginny
had
told
the
whole
school
was
buzzing
because
you
could
speak
Parseltongue
made
Ginny
write
her
own
farewell
the
wall
and
come
down
here
wait
She
struggled
and
cried
and
became
very
boring
But
there
isn
much
life
left
her
She
put
too
much
into
the
diary
into
Enough
let
leave
its
pages
last
have
been
waiting
for
you
appear
since
arrived
here
knew
you
come
have
many
questions
for
you
Harry
Potter
Like
what
Harry
spat
fists
still
clenched
Well
said
Riddle
smiling
pleasantly
how
that
you
skinny
boy
with
extraordinary
magical
talent
managed
defeat
the
greatest
wizard
all
time
How
did
you
escape
with
nothing
but
scar
while
Lord
Voldemort
powers
were
destroyed
There
was
odd
red
gleam
his
hungry
eyes
now
Why
you
care
how
escaped
said
Harry
slowly
Voldemort
was
after
your
time
Voldemort
said
Riddle
softly
past
present
and
future
Harry
Potter
pulled
Harry
wand
from
his
pocket
and
began
trace
through
the
air
writing
three
shimmering
words
TOM
MARVOLO
RIDDLE
Then
waved
the
wand
once
and
the
letters
his
name
rearranged
themselves
LORD
VOLDEMORT
You
see
whispered
was
name
was
already
using
Hogwarts
most
intimate
friends
only
course
You
think
was
going
use
filthy
Muggle
father
name
forever
whose
veins
runs
the
blood
Salazar
Slytherin
himself
through
mother
side
keep
the
name
foul
common
Muggle
who
abandoned
even
before
was
born
just
because
found
out
his
wife
was
witch
Harry
fashioned
myself
new
name
name
knew
wizards
everywhere
would
one
day
fear
speak
when
had
become
the
greatest
sorcerer
the
world
Harry
brain
seemed
have
jammed
stared
numbly
Riddle
the
orphaned
boy
who
had
grown
murder
Harry
own
parents
and
many
others
last
forced
himself
peak
You
not
said
his
quiet
voice
full
hatred
Not
what
snapped
Riddle
Not
the
greatest
sorcerer
the
world
said
Harry
breathing
fast
Sorry
disappoint
you
and
all
that
but
the
greatest
wizard
the
world
Albus
Dumbledore
Everyone
says
Even
when
you
were
strong
you
didn
dare
try
and
take
over
Hogwarts
Dumbledore
saw
through
you
when
you
were
school
and
still
frightens
you
now
wherever
you
hiding
these
days
The
smile
had
gone
from
Riddle
face
replaced
very
ugly
look
Dumbledore
been
driven
out
this
castle
the
mere
memory
hissed
not
gone
you
might
think
Harry
retorted
was
speaking
random
wanting
scare
Riddle
wishing
rather
than
believing
true
Riddle
opened
his
mouth
but
froze
Music
was
coming
from
somewhere
Riddle
whirled
around
stare
down
the
empty
Chamber
The
music
was
growing
louder
was
eerie
spine
tingling
unearthly
lifted
the
hair
Harry
scalp
and
made
his
heart
feel
though
was
swelling
twice
its
normal
size
Then
the
music
reached
such
pitch
that
Harry
felt
vibrating
inside
his
own
ribs
flames
erupted
the
top
the
nearest
pillar
crimson
bird
the
size
swan
had
appeared
piping
its
weird
music
the
vaulted
ceiling
had
glittering
golden
tail
long
peacock
and
gleaming
golden
talons
which
were
gripping
ragged
bundle
second
later
the
bird
was
flying
straight
Harry
dropped
the
ragged
thing
was
carrying
his
feet
then
landed
heavily
his
shoulder
folded
its
great
wings
Harry
looked
and
saw
had
long
sharp
golden
beak
and
beady
black
eye
The
bird
stopped
singing
sat
still
and
warm
next
Harry
cheek
gazing
steadily
Riddle
That
phoenix
said
Riddle
staring
shrewdly
back
Fawkes
Harry
breathed
and
felt
the
bird
golden
claws
squeeze
his
shoulder
gently
And
that
said
Riddle
now
eyeing
the
ragged
thing
that
Fawkes
had
dropped
that
the
old
school
Sorting
Hat
was
Patched
frayed
and
dirty
the
hat
lay
motionless
Harry
feet
Riddle
began
laugh
again
laughed
hard
that
the
dark
chamber
rang
with
though
ten
Riddles
were
laughing
once
This
what
Dumbledore
sends
his
defender
songbird
and
old
hat
you
feel
brave
Harry
Potter
you
feel
safe
now
Harry
didn
answer
might
not
see
what
use
Fawkes
the
Sorting
Hat
were
but
was
longer
alone
and
waited
for
Riddle
stop
laughing
with
his
courage
mounting
business
Harry
said
Riddle
still
smiling
broadly
Twice
your
past
future
have
met
And
twice
failed
kill
you
How
did
you
survive
Tell
everything
The
longer
you
talk
added
softly
the
longer
you
stay
alive
Harry
was
thinking
fast
weighing
his
chances
Riddle
had
the
wand
Harry
had
Fawkes
and
the
Sorting
Hat
neither
which
would
much
good
duel
looked
bad
all
right
but
the
longer
Riddle
stood
there
the
more
life
was
dwindling
out
Ginny
and
the
meantime
Harry
noticed
suddenly
Riddle
outline
was
becoming
clearer
more
solid
had
fight
between
him
and
Riddle
better
sooner
than
later
one
knows
why
you
lost
your
powers
when
you
attacked
said
Harry
abruptly
don
know
myself
But
know
why
you
couldn
kill
Because
mother
died
save
common
Muggle
born
mother
added
shaking
with
suppressed
rage
She
stopped
you
killing
And
seen
the
real
you
saw
you
last
year
You
wreck
You
barely
alive
That
where
all
your
power
got
you
You
hiding
You
ugly
you
foul
Riddle
face
contorted
Then
forced
into
awful
smile
Your
mother
died
save
you
Yes
that
powerful
countercharm
can
see
now
there
nothing
special
about
you
after
all
wondered
you
see
There
are
strange
likenesses
between
after
all
Even
you
must
have
noticed
Both
half
bloods
orphans
raised
Muggles
Probably
the
only
two
Parselmouths
come
Hogwarts
since
the
great
Slytherin
himself
even
look
something
alike
but
after
all
was
merely
lucky
chance
that
saved
you
from
That
all
wanted
know
Harry
stood
tense
waiting
for
Riddle
raise
his
wand
But
Riddle
twisted
smile
was
widening
again
Now
Harry
going
teach
you
little
lesson
Let
match
the
powers
Lord
Voldemort
Heir
Salazar
Slytherin
against
famous
Harry
Potter
and
the
best
weapons
Dumbledore
can
give
him
cast
amused
eye
over
Fawkes
and
the
Sorting
Hat
then
walked
away
Harry
fear
spreading
his
numb
legs
watched
Ridthe
stop
between
the
high
pillars
and
look
into
the
stone
face
Slytherin
high
above
him
the
half
darkness
Riddle
opened
his
mouth
wide
and
hissed
but
Harry
understood
what
was
saying
Speak
Slytherin
greatest
the
Hogwarts
Four
Harry
wheeled
around
look
the
statue
Fawkes
swaying
his
shoulder
Slytherin
gigantic
stone
face
was
moving
Horrorstruck
Harry
saw
his
mouth
opening
wider
and
wider
make
huge
black
hole
And
something
was
stirring
inside
the
statue
mouth
Something
was
slithering
from
its
depths
Harry
backed
away
until
hit
the
dark
Chamber
wall
and
shut
his
eyes
tight
felt
Fawkes
wing
sweep
his
cheek
took
flight
Harry
wanted
shout
Don
leave
but
what
chance
did
phoenix
have
against
the
king
serpents
Something
huge
hit
the
stone
floor
the
Chamber
Harry
felt
shudder
knew
what
was
happening
could
sense
could
almost
see
the
giant
serpent
uncoiling
itself
from
Slytherin
mouth
Then
heard
Riddle
hissing
voice
Kill
him
The
basilisk
was
moving
toward
Harry
could
hear
its
heavy
body
slithering
heavily
across
the
dusty
floor
Eyes
still
tightly
shut
Harry
began
run
blindly
sideways
his
hands
outstretched
feeling
his
way
Voldemort
was
laughing
Harry
tripped
fell
hard
onto
the
stone
and
tasted
blood
the
serpent
was
barely
feet
from
him
could
hear
coming
There
was
loud
explosive
spitting
sound
right
above
him
and
then
something
heavy
hit
Harry
hard
that
was
smashed
into
the
wall
Waiting
for
fangs
sink
through
his
body
heard
more
mad
hissing
something
thrashing
wildly
off
the
pillars
couldn
help
opened
his
eyes
wide
enough
squint
what
was
going
The
enormous
serpent
bright
poisonous
green
thick
oak
trunk
had
raised
itself
high
the
air
and
its
great
blunt
head
was
weaving
drunkenly
between
the
pillars
Harry
trembled
ready
close
his
eyes
turned
saw
what
had
distracted
the
snake
Fawkes
was
soaring
around
its
head
and
the
basilisk
was
snapping
furiously
him
with
fangs
long
and
thin
sabers
Fawkes
dived
His
long
golden
beak
sank
out
sight
and
318
sudden
shower
dark
blood
spattered
the
floor
The
snake
tail
thrashed
narrowly
missing
Harry
and
before
Harry
could
shut
his
eyes
turned
Harry
looked
straight
into
its
face
and
saw
that
its
eyes
both
its
great
bulbous
yellow
eyes
had
been
punctured
the
phoenix
blood
was
streaming
the
floor
and
the
snake
was
spitting
agony
Harry
heard
Riddle
screaming
LEAVE
THE
BIRD
LEAVE
THE
BIRD
THE
BOY
BEHIND
YOU
YOU
CAN
STILL
SMELL
HIM
KILL
HIMI
The
blinded
serpent
swayed
confused
still
deadly
Fawkes
was
circling
its
head
piping
his
eerie
song
jabbing
here
and
there
its
scaly
nose
the
blood
poured
from
its
ruined
eyes
Help
help
Harry
muttered
wildly
someone
anyone
The
snake
tail
whipped
across
the
floor
again
Harry
ducked
Something
soft
hit
his
face
The
basilisk
had
swept
the
Sorting
Hat
into
Harry
arms
Harry
seized
was
all
had
left
his
only
chance
rammed
onto
his
head
and
threw
himself
flat
onto
the
floor
the
basilisk
tail
swung
over
him
again
Help
help
Harry
thought
his
eyes
screwed
tight
under
the
hat
Please
help
There
was
answering
voice
Instead
the
hat
contracted
though
invisible
hand
was
squeezing
very
tightly
Something
very
hard
and
heavy
thudded
onto
the
top
Harry
head
almost
knocking
him
out
Stars
winking
front
his
eyes
grabbed
the
top
the
hat
pull
off
and
felt
something
long
and
hard
beneath
gleaming
silver
sword
had
appeared
inside
the
hat
its
handle
glittering
with
rubies
the
size
eggs
KILL
THE
BOY
LEAVE
THE
BIRD
THE
BOY
BEHIND
YOU
SNIFF
SMELL
HIM
Harry
was
his
feet
ready
The
basilisk
head
was
falling
its
body
coiling
around
hitting
pillars
twisted
face
him
could
see
the
vast
bloody
eye
sockets
see
the
mouth
stretching
wide
wide
enough
swallow
him
whole
lined
with
fangs
long
his
sword
thin
glittering
venomous
lunged
blindly
Harry
dodged
and
hit
the
Chamber
wall
lunged
again
and
its
forked
tongue
lashed
Harry
side
raised
the
sword
both
his
hands
The
basilisk
lunged
again
and
this
time
its
aim
was
true
Harry
threw
his
whole
weight
behind
the
sword
and
drove
the
hilt
into
the
roof
the
serpent
mouth
But
warm
blood
drenched
Harry
arms
felt
searing
pain
just
above
his
elbow
One
long
poisonous
fang
was
sinking
deeper
and
deeper
into
his
arm
and
splintered
the
basilisk
keeled
over
sideways
and
fell
twitching
the
floor
Harry
slid
down
the
wall
gripped
the
fang
that
was
spreading
poison
through
his
body
and
wrenched
out
his
arm
But
knew
was
too
late
White
hot
pain
was
spreading
slowly
and
steadily
from
the
wound
Even
dropped
the
fang
and
watched
his
own
blood
soaking
his
robes
his
vision
went
foggy
The
Chamber
was
dissolving
whirl
dull
color
patch
scarlet
swam
past
and
Harry
heard
soft
clatter
claws
beside
him
Fawkes
said
Harry
thickly
You
were
fantastic
Fawkes
520
felt
the
bird
lay
its
beautiful
head
the
spot
where
the
serpent
fang
had
pierced
him
could
hear
echoing
footsteps
and
then
dark
shadow
moved
front
him
You
dead
Harry
Potter
said
Riddle
voice
above
him
Dead
Even
Dumbledore
bird
knows
you
see
what
doing
Potter
crying
Harry
blinked
Fawke
head
slid
and
out
focus
Thick
pearly
tears
were
trickling
down
the
glossy
feathers
going
sit
here
and
watch
you
die
Harry
Potter
Take
your
time
hurry
Harry
felt
drowsy
Everything
around
him
seemed
spinning
ends
the
famous
Harry
Potter
said
Riddle
distant
voice
Alone
the
Chamber
Secrets
forsaken
his
friends
defeated
last
the
Dark
Lord
unwisely
challenged
You
back
with
your
dear
Mudblood
mother
soon
Harry
She
bought
you
twelve
years
borrowed
time
but
Lord
Voldemort
got
you
the
end
you
knew
must
this
dying
thought
Harry
not
bad
Even
the
pain
was
leaving
him
But
was
this
dying
Instead
going
black
the
Chamber
seemed
coming
back
into
focus
Harry
gave
his
head
little
shake
and
there
was
Fawkes
still
resting
his
head
Harry
arm
pearly
patch
tears
was
shining
all
around
the
wound
except
that
there
was
wound
Get
away
bird
said
Riddle
voice
suddenly
Get
away
from
him
said
get
away
Harry
raised
his
head
Riddle
was
pointing
Harry
wand
Fawkes
there
was
bang
like
gun
and
Fawkes
took
flight
again
whirl
gold
and
scarlet
Phoenix
tears
said
Riddle
quietly
staring
Harry
arm
course
healing
powers
forgot
looked
into
Harry
face
But
makes
difference
fact
prefer
this
way
Just
you
and
Harry
Potter
you
and
raised
the
wand
Then
rush
wings
Fawkes
had
soared
back
overhead
and
something
fell
into
Harry
lap
the
diary
For
split
second
both
Harry
and
Riddle
wand
still
raised
stared
Then
without
thinking
without
considering
though
had
meant
all
along
Harry
seized
the
basilisk
fang
the
floor
next
him
and
plunged
straight
into
the
heart
the
book
There
was
long
dreadful
piercing
scream
Ink
spurted
out
the
diary
torrents
streaming
over
Harry
hands
flooding
the
floor
Riddle
was
writhing
and
twisting
screaming
and
flailing
and
then
had
gone
Harry
wand
fell
the
floor
with
clatter
and
there
was
silence
Silence
except
for
the
steady
drip
drip
ink
still
oozing
from
the
diary
The
basilisk
venom
had
burned
sizzling
hole
right
through
Shaking
all
over
Harry
pulled
himself
His
head
was
spinning
though
just
traveled
miles
Floo
powder
Slowly
gathered
together
his
wand
and
the
Sorting
Hat
and
with
huge
tug
retrieved
the
glittering
sword
from
the
roof
the
basilisk
mouth
Then
came
faint
moan
from
the
end
the
Chamber
Ginny
was
stirring
Harry
hurried
toward
her
she
sat
Her
bemused
522
eyes
traveled
from
the
huge
form
the
dead
basilisk
over
Harry
his
blood
soaked
robes
then
the
diary
his
hand
She
drew
great
shuddering
gasp
and
tears
began
pour
down
her
face
Harry
Harry
tried
tell
you
breakfast
but
couldn
say
front
Percy
was
Harry
but
swear
diddt
mean
Riddle
made
took
over
and
how
did
you
kill
that
that
thing
where
Riddle
The
last
thing
remember
him
coming
out
the
diary
all
right
said
Harry
holding
the
diary
and
showing
Ginny
the
fang
hole
Riddle
finished
Look
Him
and
the
basilisk
mon
Ginny
let
get
out
here
going
expelled
Ginny
wept
Harry
helped
her
awkwardly
her
feet
looked
forward
coming
Hogwarts
ever
since
Bill
came
and
now
have
leave
and
what
Mum
and
Dad
say
Fawkes
was
waiting
for
them
hovering
the
Chamber
entrance
Harry
urged
Ginny
forward
they
stepped
over
the
motionless
coils
the
dead
basilisk
through
the
echoing
gloom
and
back
into
the
tunnel
Harry
heard
the
stone
doors
close
behind
them
with
soft
hiss
After
few
minutes
progress
the
dark
tunnel
distant
sound
slowly
shifting
rock
reached
Harry
ears
Ron
Harry
yelled
speeding
Ginny
okay
got
her
heard
Ron
give
strangled
cheer
and
they
turned
the
next
bend
see
his
eager
face
staring
through
the
sizable
gap
had
managed
make
the
rock
fall
Ginny
Ron
thrust
arm
through
the
gap
the
rock
pull
321
her
through
first
You

believe
What

How

through

Harry
squeezing
through
himself
How

Ron
gaping
the
glittering
weapon
Harry
hand

said
Harry
with
sideways
glance
Ginny
who
was
crying
harder
than
ever
But
Later
Harry
said
shortly
didn
think
was
good
idea
tell
Ron
yet
who
been
opening
the
Chamber
not
front
Ginny
anyway
Where

Ron
still
looking
puzzled
but
jerking
his
head
the
tunnel
toward
the
pipe

Led
Fawkes
whose
wide
scarlet
wings
emitted
soft
golden
glow
the
darkness
they
walked

way
back

mouth

pipe
Gilderoy
Lockhart
was
sitting
there
humming
placidly
himself
His

Ron
The

Lockhart
peered
good
naturedly

Odd

said
Ron
raising
his
eyebrows
Harry
Harry
bent
down
and
looked
the
long
dark
pipe
Have

thought
how
going

back

said
Ron
324
Ron
shook
his
head
but
Fawkes
the
phoenix
had
swooped
past
Harry
and
was
now
fluttering
front
him
his
beady
eyes
bright
the
dark
was
waving
his
long
golden
tail
feathers
Harry
looked
uncertainly

Fawkes
strangely
hot

extraordinary
lightness
seemed
spread
through
his
whole
body
and
the
next
second
rush
wings
they
were
flying
upward
through
the
pipe
Harry
could
hear
Lockhart
dangling
below
him
saying
Amazing
Amazing
This
just
like
magic
The
chill
air
was
whipping
through
Harry
hair
and
before
stopped
enjoying
the
ride
was
over
all
four
them
were
hitting
the
wet
floor
Moaning

and
Lockhart
straightened
his

the

Myrtle

them
You

Ron
they
left
the

for
the
dark
deserted
corridor
outside
Harry

Myrtle
grown
fond

You

Ginny
But
tears
were
still
flooding
silently
down
Ginny
face
Where
now
said
Ron
with
anxious
look
Ginny
Harry
pointed
Fawkes
was
leading
the
way
glowing
gold
along
the
corridor
They
strode
after
him
and
moments
later
found
themselves
outside
Professor
McGonagall
office
Harry
knocked
and
pushed
the
door
open
REWARD
moment
there
was
silence
Harry
Ron
Ginny
and
Lockhart
stood
the
doorway
covered
muck
and
slime
and
Harry
case
blood
Then
there
was
scream
Ginny
was
Mrs
Weasley
who
had
been
sitting
crying
front
the
fire
She
leapt
her
feet
closely
followed
Weasley
and
both
them
flung
themselves
their
daughter
Harry
however
was
looking
past
them
Professor
Dumbledore
was
standing
the
mantelpiece
beaming
next
Professor
McGonagall
who
was
taking
great
steadying
gasps
clutching
her
chest
Fawkes
went
whooshing
past
Harry
ear
and
settled
Dumbledore
shoulder
just
Harry
found
himself
and
Ron
being
swept
into
Mrs
Weasleys
tight
embrace
You
saved
her
You
saved
her
How
did
you
think
all
like
know
that
said
Professor
McGonagall
weakly
Mrs
Weasley
let
Harry
who
hesitated
for
moment
then
walked
over
the
desk
and
laid
upon
the
Sorting
Hat
the
rubyencrusted
sword
and
what
remained
Riddle
diary
Then
started
telling
them
everything
For
nearly
quarter
hour
spoke
into
the
rapt
silence
told
them
about
hearing
the
disembodied
voice
how
Hermione
had
finally
realized
that
was
hearing
basilisk
the
pipes
how
and
Ron
had
followed
the
spiders
into
the
forest
that
Aragog
had
told
them
where
the
last
victim
the
basilisk
had
died
how
had
guessed
that
Moaning
Myrtle
had
been
the
victim
and
that
the
entrance
the
Chamber
Secrets
might
her
bathroom
Very
well
Professor
McGonagall
prompted
him
paused
you
found
out
where
the
entrance
was
breaking
hundred
school
rules
into
pieces
along
the
way
might
add
but
how
earth
did
you
all
get
out
there
alive
Potter
Harry
his
voice
now
growing
hoarse
from
all
this
talking
told
them
about
Fawkes
timely
arrival
and
about
the
Sorting
Hat
giving
him
the
sword
But
then
faltered
had
far
avoided
mentioning
Riddle
diary
Ginny
She
was
standing
with
her
head
against
Mrs
Weasley
shoulder
and
tears
were
still
coursing
silently
down
her
cheeks
What
they
expelled
her
Harry
thought
panic
Riddle
diary
didn
work
anymore
How
could
they
prove
had
been
who
made
her
all
Instinctively
Harry
looked
Dumbledore
who
smiled
faintly
the
firelight
glancing
off
his
half
moon
spectacles
What
interests
most
said
Dumbledore
gently
how
Lord
Voldemort
managed
enchant
Ginny
when
sources
tell
currently
hiding
the
forests

Relief
warm

glorious
relief
swept
over
Harry
what
that

Weasley

voice
YouKnow
Who

But
Ginny
not
Ginny

she
was
this
diary
said
Harry
quickly
picking
and
showing
Dumbledore
Riddle
wrote
when
was
sixteen
Dumbledore
took
the
diary
from
Harry
and
peered
keenly
down
his
long
crooked
nose
its
burnt
and
soggy
pages
Brilliant
said
softly
course
was
probably
the
most
brilliant
student
Hogwarts
has
ever
seen
turned
around
the
Weasleys
who
were
looking
utterly
bewildered
Very
few
people

that
Lord
Voldemort

once

Tom

him
myself
fifty
years
ago
Hogwarts

and
wide
sank
deeply
into
the
Dark
Arts
consorted
with
the
very
worst
our
kind
underwent
many
dangerous
magical
transformations
that
when
resurfaced
Lord
Voldemort
was
barely
recognizable
Hardly
anyone
connected
Lord
Voldemort
with
the
clever
handsome
boy
who
was
once
Head
Boy
here
But
Ginny
said
Mrs

What

His

Weasley
flabbergasted
Haven

What

always
told
you
Never
trust
anything
that

Why

you

Ginny

someone
had
just

there
and
forgotten
about
Miss

Dumbledore
interrupted
firm
voice
This
has
been
terrible
ordeal
for
her
There
will
punishment
Older
and
wiser
wizards
than
she
have
been

Lord
Voldemort

over

door
and
opened

You

Hermione

said
Ron
brightly
There
has
been
lasting
harm
done
Ginny
said
Dumbledore
Mrs
Weasley
led
Ginny
out
and
Weasley
followed
still
looking
deeply
shaken
You
know
Minerva
Professor
Dumbledore
said
thoughtfully
Professor
McGonagall
think
all
this
merits
good
feast
Might
ask
you
and
alert
the
kitchens
Right
said
Professor
McGonagall
crisply
also
moving
the
door
leave
you
deal
with
Potter
and
Weasley
shall
Certainly
said
Dumbledore
She
left
and
Harry
and
Ron
gazed
uncertainly
Dumbledore
What
exactly
had
Professor
McGonagall
meant
deal
with
them
Surely
surely
they
weren
about
punished
seem
remember
telling
you
both
that
would
have
expel
you
you
broke
any
more
school
rules
said
Dumbledore
Ron
opened
his
mouth
horror
Which
goes
show
that
the
best
must
sometimes
eat
our
words
Dumbledore
went
smiling
You
will
both
receive
Special
Awards
for
Services
the
School
and
let
see
yes
think
two
hundred
points
apiece
for
Gryffindor
Ron
went
briglitly
pink
Lockhart
valentine
flowers
and
closed
his
mouth
again
But
one
seems
keeping
mightily
quiet
about
his
part
this
dangerous
adventure
Dumbledore
added
Why
modest
Gilderoy
Harry
gave
start
had
completely
forgotten
about
Lockhart
turned
and
saw
that
Lockhart
was
standing
corner
the
room
still
wearing
his
vague
smile
When
Dumbledore
addressed
him
Lockhart
looked
over
his
shoulder
see
who
was
talking
Professor
Dumbledore
Ron
said
quickly
there
was
accident
down
the
Chamber
Secrets
Professor
Lockhart
professor
said
Lockhart
mild
surprise
Goodness
expect
was
hopeless
was
tried
Memory
Charm
and
the
wand
backfired
Ron
explained
quietly
Dumbledore
Dear
said
Dumbledore
shaking
his
head
his
long
silver
mustache
quivering
Impaled
upon
your
own
sword
Gilderoy
Sword
said
Lockhart
dimly
Haven
got
sword
That
boy
has
though
pointed
Harry
lend
you
one
Would
you
mind
taking
Professor
Lockhart
the
infirmary
too
Dumbledore
said
Ron
like
few
more
words
with
Harry
Lockhart
ambled
out
Ron
cast
curious
look
back
Dumbledore
and
Harry
closed
the
door
Dumbledore
crossed
one
the
chairs
the
fire
Sit
down
Harry
said
and
Harry
sat
feeling
unaccountably
nervous
First
all
Harry
want
thank
you
said
Dumbledore
eyes
twinkling
again
You
must
have
shown
real
loyalty
down
the
Chamber
Nothing
but
that
could
have
called
Fawkes
you
stroked
the
phoenix
which
had
fluttered
down
onto
his
knee
Harry
grinned
awkwardly
Dumbledore
watched
him
And
you
met
Tom
Riddle
said
Dumbledore
thoughtfully
imagine
was
most
interested
you
Suddenly
something
that
was
nagging
Harry
came
tumbling
out
his
mouth
Professor
Dumbledore
Riddle
said
like
him
Strange
likenesses
said
Did
now
said
Dumbledore
looking
thoughtfully
Harry
from
under
his
thick
silver
eyebrows
And
what
you
think
Harry
don
think
like
him
said
Harry
more
loudly
than
intended
mean
Gryffindor
But
fell
silent
lurking
doubt
resurfacing
his
mind
Professor
started
again
after
moment
The
Sorting
Hat
told
have
done
well
Slytherin
Everyone
thought
was
Slytherin
heir
for
while
because
can
speak
Parseltongue
You
can
speak
Parseltongue
Harry
said
Dumbledore
calmly
because
Lord
Voldemort
who
the
last
remaining
ancestor
Salazar
Slytherin
can
speak
Parseltongue
Unless
much
mistaken
transferred
some
his
own
powers
you
the
night
gave
you
that
scar
Not
something
intended
sure
Voldemort
put
bit
himself
Harry
said
thunderstruck
certainly
seems
should
Slytherin
Harry
said
looking
desperately
into
Dumbledore
face
The
Sorting
Hat
could
see
Slytherin
power
and
Put
you
Gryffindor
said
Dumbledore
calmly
Listen
Harry
You
happen
have
many
qualities
Salazar
Slytherin
prized
his
hand
picked
students
His
own
very
rare
gift
Parseltongue
resourcefulness
determination
certain
disregard
for
rules
added
his
mustache
quivering
again
Yet
the
Sorting
Hat
placed
you
Gryffindor
You
know
why
that
was
Think
only
put
Gryffindor
said
Harry
defeated
voice
because
asked
not
Slytherin
Exactly
said
Dumbledore
beaming
once
more
Which
makes
you
very
different
from
Tom
Riddle
our
choices
Harry
that
show
what
truly
are
far
more
than
our
abilities
Harry
sat
motionless
his
chair
stunned
you
want
proof
Harry
that
you
belong
Gryffindor
suggest
you
look
more
closely
this
Dumbledore
reached
across
Professor
McGonagall
desk
picked
the
blood
stained
silver
sword
and
handed
Harry
Dully
Harry
turned
over
the
rubies
blazing
the
firelight
And
then
saw
the
name
engraved
just
below
the
hilt
Godric
Gryffindor
333
Only
true
Gryffindor
could
have
pulled
that
out
the
hat
Harry
said
Dumbledore
simply
For
minute
neither
them
spoke
Then
Dumbledore
pulled
open
one
the
drawers
Professor
McGonagall
desk
and
took
out
quill
and
bottle
ink
What
you
need
Harry
some
food
and
sleep
suggest
you
down
the
feast
while
write
Azkaban
need
our
gamekeeper
back
And
must
draft

for
the
Daily
Prophet
too
added
thoughtfully
needing

Defense

Dark
Arts
teacher
Dear
seem
run
through
them
don
Harry
got
and
crossed
the
door
had
just
reached
for
the
handle
however
when
the
door
burst
open
violently
that
bounced
back
off
the
wall
Lucius
Malfoy
stood
there
fury
his
face
And
cowering
behind
his
legs
heavily
wrapped
bandages
was
Dobby
Good
evening
Lucius
said
Dumbledore
pleasantly
Malfoy
almost
knocked
Harry
over
swept
into
the
room
Dobby
went
scurrying
after
him
crouching
the
hem
his
cloak
look
abject
terror
his
face
The
elf
was
carrying
stained
rag
with
which
was
attempting
finish
cleaning
Malfoys
shoes
Apparently
Malfoy
had
set
out
great
hurry
for
not
only
were
his
shoes
half
polished
but
his
usually
sleek
hair
was
disheveled
Ignoring
the
elf
bobbing
apologetically
around
his
ankles
fixed
his
cold
eyes
upon
Dumbledore
said
You
come
back
The
governors
suspended
you
but
you
still
saw
fit
return
Hogwarts
Well
you
see
Lucius
said
Dumbledore
smiling
serenely
the
other
eleven
governors
contacted
today
was
something
like
being
caught
hailstorm
owls
tell
the
truth
They
heard
that
Arthur
Weasleys
daughter
had
been
killed
and
wanted
back
here
once
They
seemed
think
was
the
best
man
for
the
job
after
all
Very
strange
tales
they
told
too
Several
them
seemed
think
that
you
had
threatened
curse
their
families
they
didn
agree
suspend
the
first
place
Malfoy
went
even
paler
than
usual
but
his
eyes
were
still
slits
fury
have
you
stopped
the
attacks
yet
sneered
Have
you
caught
the
culprit
have
said
Dumbledore
with
smile
Well
said
Malfoy
sharply
Who
The
same
person
last
time
Lucius
said
Dumbledore
But
this
time
Lord
Voldemort
was
acting
through
somebody
else
means
this
diary
held
the
small
black
book
with
the
large
hole
through
the
center
watching
Malfoy
closely
Harry
however
was
watching
Dobby
The
elf
was
doing
something
very
odd
His
great
eyes
fixed
meaningfully
Harry
kept
pointing
the
diary
then
Malfoy
and
then
hitting
himself
hard
the
head
with
his
fist
see
said
Malfoy
slowly
Dumbledore
clever
plan
said
Dumbledore
level
voice
still
staring
Malfoy
straight
the
eye
Because
Harry
here
Malfoy
shot
Harry
swift
sharp
look
and
his
friend
Ron
hadn
discovered
this
book
why
Ginny
Weasley
might
have
taken
all
335
the
blame
one
would
ever
have
been
able
prove
she
hadn
acted
her
own
free
will
Malfoy
said
nothing
His
face
was
suddenly
masklike
And
imagine
Dumbledore
went
what
might
have
happened
then
The
Weasleys
are
one
our
most
prominent
pure
blood
families
Imagine
the
effect
Arthur
Weasley
and
his
Muggle
Protection
Act
his
own
daughter
was
discovered
attacking
and
killing
Muggle
borns
Very
fortunate
the
diary
was
discovered
and
Riddle
memories
wiped
from
Who
knows
what
the
consequences
might
have
been
otherwise
Malfoy
forced
himself
speak
Very
fortunate
said
stiffly
And
still
behind
his
back
Dobby
was
pointing
first
the
diary
then
Lucius
Malfoy
then
punching
himself
the
head
And
Harry
suddenly
understood
nodded
Dobby
and
Dobby
backed
into
corner
now
twisting
his
ears
punishment
Don
you
want
know
how
Ginny
got
hold
that
diary
Malfoy
said
Harry
Lucius
Malfoy
rounded
him
How
should
know
how
the
stupid
little
girl
got
hold
said
Because
you
gave
her
said
Harry
Flourish
and
Blotts
You
picked
her
old
Transfiguration
book
and
slipped
the
diary
inside
didn
you
saw
Malfoy
white
hands
clench
and
unclench
Prove
hissed
one
will
able
that
said
Dumbledore
smiling
Harry
Not
now
that
Riddle
has
vanished
from
the
book
336
the
other
hand
would
advise
you
Lucius
not
giving
out
any
more
Lord
Voldemort
old
school
things
any
more
them
find
their
way
into
innocent
hands
think
Arthur
Weasley
for
one
will
make
sure
they
are
traced
back
you
Lucius
Malfoy
stood
for
moment
and
Harry
distinctly
saw
his
right
hand
twitch
though
was
longing
reach
for
his
wand
Instead
turned
his
house
elf
going
Dobby
wrenched
open
the
door
and
the
elf
came
hurrying
him
kicked
him
right
through
They
could
hear
Dobby
squealing
with
pain
all
the
way
along
the
corridor
Harry
stood
for
moment
thinking
hard
Then
came
him
Professor
Dumbledore
said
hurriedly
Can
give
that
diary
back
Malfoy
please
Certainly
Harry
said
Dumbledore
calmly
But
hurry
The
feast
remember
Harry
grabbed
the
diary
and
dashed
out
the
office
could
hear
Dobby
squeals
pain
receding
around
the
corner
Quickly
wondering
this
plan
could
possibly
work
Harry
took
off
one
his
shoes
pulled
off
his
slimy
filthy
sock
and
stuffed
the
diary
into
Then
ran
down
the
dark
corridor
caught
with
them
the
top
the
stairs
Malfoy
gasped
skidding
halt
got
something
for
you
And
forced
the
smelly
sock
into
Lucius
Malfoy
hand
What
the
Malfoy
ripped
the
sock
off
the
diary
threw
aside
then
looked
furiously
from
the
ruined
book
Harry
531
You
meet
the
same
sticky
end
your
parents
one
these
days
Harry
Potter
said
softly
They
were
meddlesome
fools
too
turned
Come
Dobby
said
come
But
Dobby
didn
move
was
holding
Harry
disgusting
slimy
sock
and
looking
though
were
priceless
treasure
Master
has
given
sock
said
the
elf
wonderment
Master
gave
Dobby
What
that
spat
Malfoy
What
did
you
say
Got
sock
said
Dobby
disbelief
Master
threw
and
Dobby
caught
and
Dobby
Dobby
free
Lucius
Malfoy
stood
frozen
staring
the
elf
Then
lunged
Harry
You
lost
servant
boy
But
Dobby
shouted
You
shall
not
harm
Harry
Potter
There
was
loud
bang
and
Malfoy
was
thrown
backward
crashed
down
the
stairs
three
time
landing
crumpled
heap
the
landing
below
got
his
face
livid
and
pulled
out
his
wand
but
Dobby
raised
long
threatening
finger
You
shall
now
said
fiercely
pointing
down
Malfoy
You
shall
not
touch
Harry
Potter
You
shall
now
Lucius
Malfoy
had
choice
With
last
incensed
stare
the
pair
them
swung
his
cloak
around
him
and
hurried
out
sight
Harry
Potter
freed
Dobby
said
the
elf
shrilly
gazing
Harry
moonlight
from
the
nearest
window
reflected
his
orb
like
eyes
Harry
Potter
set
Dobby
free
Least
could
Dobby
said
Harry
grinning
Just
promise
never
try
and

And
with
final
loud
crack
Dobby
disappeared
Harry
had
been

but
never

quite
like

Everybody

lasted
all
night
Harry

Hermione
they

When
