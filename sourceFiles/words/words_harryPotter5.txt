DUDLEY
DEMENTED
The
hottest
day
the
summer
far
was
drawing
close
and
drowsy
silence
lay
over
the
large
square
houses
Privet
Drive
Cars
that
were
usually
gleaming
stood
dusty
their
drives
and
lawns
that
were
once
emerald
green
lay
parched
and
yellowing
for
the
use
hosepipes
had
been
banned
due
drought
Deprived
their
usual
car
washing
and
lawn
mowing
pursuits
the
inhabitants
Privet
Drive
had
retreated
into
the
shade
their
cool
houses
windows
thrown
wide
the
hope
tempting
nonexistent
breeze
The
only
person
left
outdoors
was
teenage
boy
who
was
lying
flat
his
back
flowerbed
outside
number
four
was
skinny
black
haired
bespectacled
boy
who
had
the
pinched
slightly
unhealthy
look
someone
who
has
grown
lot
short
space
time
His
jeans
were
torn
and
dirty
his
shirt
baggy
and
faded
and
the
soles
his
trainers
were
peeling
away
from
the
uppers
Harry
Potter
appearance
did
not
endear
him
the
neighbours
who
were
the
sort
people
who
thought
scruffiness
ought
punishable
law
but
had
hidden
himself
behind
large
hydrangea
bush
this
evening
was
quite
invisible
passers
fact
the
only
way
would
spotted
was
hisUncle
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia
stuck
their
heads
out
the
living
room
window
and
looked
straight
down
into
the
flowerbed
below
the
whole
Harry
thought
was
congratulated
his
idea
hiding
here
was
not
perhaps
very
comfortable
lying
the
hot
hard
earth
but
the
other
hand
nobody
was
glaring
him
grinding
their
teeth
loudly
that
could
not
hear
the
news
shooting
nasty
questions
him
had
happened
every
time
had
tried
sitting
down
the
living
room
watch
television
with
his
aunt
and
uncle
Almost
though
this
thought
had
fluttered
through
the
open
window
Vernon
Dursley
Harry
uncle
suddenly
spoke
Glad
see
the
boy
stopped
trying
butt
Where
anyway
don
know
said
Aunt
Petunia
unconcerned
Not
the
house
Uncle
Vernon
grunted
Watching
the
news
said
scathingly
like
know
what
really
normal
boy
cares
what
the
news
Dudley
hasn
got
clue
what
going
doubt
knows
who
the
Prime
Minister
Anyway
not
there
anything
abouthis
lot
onour
news
Vernon
shh
said
Aunt
Petunia
The
window
open
yes
sorry
dear
The
Dursleys
fell
silent
Harry
listened
jingle
about
Fruit
Bran
breakfast
cereal
while
watched
Mrs
Figg
batty
cat
loving
old
lady
from
nearby
Wisteria
Walk
amble
slowly
past
She
was
frowning
and
muttering
herself
Harry
was
very
pleased
was
concealed
behind
the
bush
Mrs
Figg
had
recently
taken
asking
him
round
for
tea
whenevershe
met
him
the
street
She
had
rounded
the
corner
and
vanished
from
view
before
Uncle
Vernon
voice
floated
out
the
window
again
Dudders
out
for
tea
the
Polkisses
said
Aunt
Petunia
fondly
got
many
little
friends
popular
Harry
suppressed
snort
with
difficulty
The
Dursleys
really
were
astonishingly
stupid
about
their
son
Dudley
They
had
swallowed
all
his
dim
witted
lies
about
having
tea
with
different
member
his
gang
every
night
the
summer
holidays
Harry
knew
perfectly
well
that
Dudley
had
not
been
tea
anywhere
and
his
gang
spent
every
evening
vandalising
the
play
park
smoking
street
corners
and
throwing
stones
passing
cars
and
children
Harry
had
seen
them
during
his
evening
walks
around
Little
Whinging
had
spent
most
the
holidays
wandering
the
streets
scavenging
newspapers
from
bins
along
the
way
The
opening
notes
the
music
that
heralded
the
seven
clock
news
reached
Harry
ears
and
his
stomach
turned
over
Perhaps
tonight
after
month
waiting
would
the
night
Record
numbers
stranded
holiday
makers
fill
airports
the
Spanish
baggage
handlers
strike
reaches
its
second
week
Give
lifelong
siesta
would
snarled
Uncle
Vernon
over
the
end
the
newsreader
sentence
but
matter
outside
the
flowerbed
Harry
stomach
seemed
unclench
anything
had
happened
would
surely
have
been
the
first
item
the
news
death
and
destruction
were
more
important
than
stranded
holidaymakers
let
out
long
slow
breath
and
stared
the
brilliant
blue
sky
Every
day
this
summer
had
been
the
same
the
tension
the
expectation
the
temporary
relief
and
then
mounting
tension
again
and
always
growing
more
insistent
all
the
time
the
question
ofwhy
nothing
had
happened
yet
kept
listening
just
case
there
was
some
small
clue
not
recognised
for
what
really
was
the
Muggles
unexplained
disappearance
perhaps
some
strange
accident
but
the
baggage
handlers
strike
was
followed
news
about
the
drought
the
Southeast

door

Uncle

Him

Aunt
Petunia
who
had
followed
the
case
obsessively
every
magazine
she
could
lay
her
bony
hands
Harry
closed
his
eyes
against
the
now
blazing
evening
sky
the
newsreader
said
and
finally
Bungy

Harry
opened
his

they
had
reached
water

budgerigars
there
would
nothing
else
worth
hearing
rolled
cautiously
his
front
and
raised
himself
his
knees
and
elbows
preparing
crawl
out
from
under
the
window
had
moved
about
two
inches
when
several
things
happened
very
quick
succession
loud
echoingcrack
broke
the
sleepy
silence
like
gunshot
cat
streaked
out
from
under
parked
car
and
flew
out
sight
shriek
bellowed
oath
and
the
sound
breaking
china
came
from
the
Dursleys
living
room
and
though
this
was
the
signal
Harry
had
been
waiting
for
jumped
his
feet
the
same
time
pulling
from
the
waistband
his
jeans
thin
wooden
wand
were
unsheathing
sword
but
before
could
draw
himself
full
height
the
top
his
head
collided
with
the
Dursleys
open
window
The
resultantcrash
made
Aunt
Petunia
scream
even
louder
Harry
felt
though
his
head
had
been
split
two
Eyes
streaming
swayed
trying
focus
the
street
spot
the
source
the
noise
but
had
barely
staggered
upright
when
two
large
purple
hands
reached
through
the
open
window
and
closed
tightly
around
his
throat
Put
away
Uncle
Vernon
snarled
into
Harry
ear
Now
Before
anyone
sees
Get
off
Harry
gasped
For
few
seconds
they
struggled
Harry
pulling
his
uncles
sausage
like
fingers
with
his
left
hand
his
right
maintaining
firm
grip
his
raised
wand
then
the
pain
the
top
Harry
head
gave
particularly
nasty
throb
Uncle
Vernon
yelped
and
released
Harry
though
had
received
electric
shock
Some
invisible
force
seemed
have
surged
through
his
nephew
making
him
impossible
hold
Panting
Harry
fell
forwards
over
the
hydrangea
bush
straightened
and
stared
around
There
was
sign
what
had
caused
the
loud
cracking
noise
but
there
were
several
faces
peering
through
various
nearby
windows
Harry
stuffed
his
wand
hastily
back
into
his
jeans
and
tried
look
innocent
Lovely
evening
shouted
Uncle
Vernon
waving
Mrs
Number
Seven
opposite
who
was
glaring
from
behind
her
net
curtains
Did
you
hear
that
car
backfire
just
now
Gave
Petunia
and
quite
turn
continued
grin
horrible
manic
way
until
all
the
curious
neighbours
had
disappeared
from
their
various
windows
then
the
grin
became
grimace
rage
beckoned
Harry
back
towards
him
Harry
moved
few
steps
closer
taking
care
stop
just
short
the
point
which
Uncle
Vernon
outstretched
hands
could
resume
their
strangling
What
thedevil
you
mean
boy
asked
Uncle
Vernon
croaky
voice
that
trembled
with
fury
What
mean
what
said
Harry
coldly
kept
looking
left
and
right
the
street
still
hoping
see
the
person
who
had
made
the
cracking
noise
Making
racket
like
starting
pistol
right
outside
our
didn
make
that
noise
said
Harry
firmly
Aunt
Petunia
thin
horsy
face
now
appeared
beside
Uncle
Vernon
wide
purple
one
She
looked
livid
Why
were
you
lurking
under
our
window
Yes
yes
good
point
Petunia
What
were
you
doing
under
our
window
boy
Listening
the
news
said
Harry
resigned
voice
His
aunt
and
uncle
exchanged
looks
outrage
Listening
the
news
Again
Well
changes
every
day
you
see
said
Harry
Don
you
clever
with
boy
want
know
what
you
really
and
don
give
any
more
thislistening
the
newstosh
You
know
perfectly
well
thatyour
lot
Careful
Vernon
breathed
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
lowered
his
voice
that
Harry
could
barely
hear
him
thatyour
lot
don
get
onour
news
That
all
you
know
said
Harry
The
Dursleys
goggled
him
for
few
seconds
then
Aunt
Petunia
said
You
nasty
little
liar
What
are
all
those
she
too
lowered
her
voice
that
Harry
had
lip
read
the
next
word
owls
doing
they
not
bringing
you
news
Aha
said
Uncle
Vernon
triumphant
whisper
Get
out
that
one
boy
didn
know
you
get
all
your
news
from
those
pestilential
birds
Harry
hesitated
for
moment
cost
him
something
tell
the
truth
this
time
even
though
his
aunt
and
uncle
could
not
possibly
know
how
bad
felt
admitting
The
owls
aren
bringing
news
said
tonelessly
don
believe
said
Aunt
Petunia
once
more
said
Uncle
Vernon
forcefully
know
you
something
funny
said
Aunt
Petunia
not
stupid
you
know
said
Uncle
Vernon
Well
that
news
said
Harry
his
temper
rising
and
before
the
Dursleys
could
call
him
back
had
wheeled
about
crossed
the
front
lawn
stepped
over
the
low
garden
wall
and
was
striding
off
the
street
was
trouble
now
and
knew
would
have
face
his
aunt
and
uncle
later
and
pay
the
price
for
his
rudeness
but
did
not
care
very
much
just
the
moment
had
much
more
pressing
matters
his
mind
Harry
was
sure
the
cracking
noise
had
been
made
someone
Apparating
Disapparating
was
exactly
the
sound
Dobby
the
house
elf
made
when
vanished
into
thin
air
Was
possible
that
Dobby
was
here
Privet
Drive
Could
Dobby
following
him
right
this
very
moment
this
thought
occurred
wheeled
around
and
stared
back
down
Privet
Drive
but
appeared
completely
deserted
and
Harry
was
sure
that
Dobby
did
not
know
how
become
invisible
walked
hardly
aware
the
route
was
taking
for
had
pounded
these
streets
often
lately
that
his
feet
carried
him
his
favourite
haunts
automatically
Every
few
steps
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
Someone
magical
had
been
near
him
lay
among
Aunt
Petunia
dying
begonias
was
sure
Why
hadn
they
spoken
him
why
hadn
they
made
contact
why
were
they
hiding
now
And
then
his
feeling
frustration
peaked
his
certainty
leaked
away
Perhaps
hadn
been
magical
sound
after
all
Perhaps
was
desperate
for
the
tiniest
sign
contact
from
the
world
which
belonged
that
was
simply
overreacting
perfectly
ordinary
noises
Could
besure
hadn
been
the
sound
something
breaking
inside
neighbour
house
Harry
felt
dull
sinking
sensation
his
stomach
and
before
knew
the
feeling
hopelessness
that
had
plagued
him
all
summer
rolled
over
him
once
again
Tomorrow
morning
would
woken
the
alarm
five
clock
could
pay
the
owl
that
delivered
theDaily
Prophet
but
was
there
any
point
continuing
take
Harry
merely
glanced
the
front
page
before
throwing
aside
these
days
when
the
idiots
who
ran
the
paper
finally
realised
that
Voldemort
was
back
would
headline
news
and
that
was
the
only
kind
Harry
cared
about
was
lucky
there
would
also
owls
carrying
letters
from
his
best
friends
Ron
and
Hermione
though
any
expectation
had
that
their
letters
would
bring
him
news
had
long
since
been
dashed
can
say
much
about
you
know
what
obviously
been
told
not
say
anything
important
case
our
letters
astray
quite
busy
but
can
give
you
details
here
There
fair
amount
going
tell
you
everything
when
see
you
But
when
were
they
going
see
him
Nobody
seemed
too
bothered
with
precise
date
Hermione
had
scribbledI
expect
seeing
you
quite
soon
inside
his
birthday
card
but
how
soon
was
soon
far
Harry
could
tell
from
the
vague
hints
their
letters
Hermione
and
Ron
were
the
same
place
presumably
Ron
parents
house
could
hardly
bear
think
the
pair
them
having
fun
The
Burrow
when
was
stuck
Privet
Drive
fact
was
angry
with
them
had
thrown
away
unopened
the
two
boxes
Honeydukes
chocolates
they
sent
him
for
his
birthday
regretted
later
after
the
wilted
salad
Aunt
Petunia
had
provided
for
dinner
that
night
And
what
were
Ron
and
Hermione
busy
with
Why
wasn
Harry
busy
Hadn
proved
himself
capable
handling
much
more
than
them
Had
they
all
forgotten
what
had
done
Hadn
beenhe
who
had
entered
that
graveyard
and
watched
Cedric
being
murdered
and
been
tied
that
tombstone
and
nearly
killed
Don
think
about
that
Harry
told
himself
sternly
for
the
hundredth
lime
that
summer
was
bad
enough
that
kept
revisiting
the
graveyard
his
nightmares
without
dwelling
his
waking
moments
too
turned
corner
into
Magnolia
Crescent
halfway
along
passed
the
narrow
alleyway
down
the
side
garage
where
had
first
clapped
eyes
his
godfather
Sirius
least
seemed
understand
how
Harry
was
feeling
Admittedly
his
letters
were
just
empty
proper
news
Ron
and
Hermione
but
least
they
contained
words
caution
and
consolation
instead
tantalising
hints
know
this
must
frustrating
for
you
Keep
your
nose
clean
and
everything
will
careful
and
don
anything
rash
Well
thought
Harry
crossed
Magnolia
Crescent
turned
into
Magnolia
Road
and
headed
towards
the
darkening
play
park
had
and
large
done
Sirius
advised
had
least
resisted
the
temptation
tie
his
trunk
his
broomstick
and
set
off
for
The
Burrow
himself
fact
Harry
thought
his
behaviour
had
been
very
good
considering
how
frustrated
and
angry
felt
being
stuck
Privet
Drive
long
reduced
hiding
flowerbeds
the
hope
hearing
something
that
might
point
what
Lord
Voldemort
was
doing
Nevertheless
was
quite
galling
told
not
rash
man
who
had
served
twelve
years
the
wizard
prison
Azkaban
escaped
attempted
commit
the
murder
had
been
convicted
for
the
first
place
then
gone
the
run
with
stolen
Hippogriff
Harry
vaulted
over
the
locked
park
gate
and
set
off
across
the
parched
grass
The
park
was
empty
the
surrounding
streets
When
reached
the
swings
sank
the
only
one
that
Dudley
and
his
friends
had
not
yet
managed
break
coiled
one
arm
around
the
chain
and
stared
moodily
the
ground
would
not
able
hide
the
Dursleys
flowerbed
again
Tomorrow
would
have
think
some
fresh
way
listening
the
news
the
meantime
had
nothing
look
forward
but
another
restless
disturbed
night
because
even
when
escaped
the
nightmares
about
Cedric
had
unsettling
dreams
about
long
dark
corridors
all
finishing
dead
ends
and
locked
doors
which
supposed
had
something
with
the
trapped
feeling
had
when
was
awake
Often
the
old
scar
his
forehead
prickled
uncomfortably
but
did
not
fool
himself
that
Ron
Hermione
Sirius
would
find
that
very
interesting
any
more
the
past
his
scar
hurting
had
warned
that
Voldemort
was
getting
stronger
again
but
now
that
Voldemort
was
back
they
would
probably
remind
him
that
its
regular
irritation
was
only
expected
nothing
worry
about
old
news
The
injustice
all
welled
inside
him
that
wanted
yell
with
fury
hadn
been
for
him
nobody
would
even
have
known
Voldemort
was
back
And
his
reward
was
stuck
Little
Whinging
for
four
solid
weeks
completely
cut
off
from
the
magical
world
reduced
squatting
among
dying
begonias
that
could
hear
about
water
skiing
budgerigars
How
could
Dumbledorehave
forgotten
him
easily
Why
had
Ron
and
Hermione
got
together
without
inviting
him
along
too
How
much
longer
was
supposed
endure
Sirius
telling
him
sit
tight
and
good
boy
resist
the
temptation
write
the
stupidDaily
Prophet
and
point
out
that
Voldemort
had
returned
These
furious
thoughts
whirled
around
Harry
head
and
his
insides
writhed
with
anger
sultry
velvety
night
fell
around
him
the
air
full
the
smell
warm
dry
grass
and
the
only
sound
that
the
low
grumble
traffic
the
road
beyond
the
park
railings
did
not
know
how
long
had
sat
the
swing
before
the
sound
voices
interrupted
his
musings
and
looked
The
streetlamps
from
the
surrounding
roads
were
casting
misty
glow
strong
enough
silhouette
group
people
making
their
way
across
the
park
One
them
was
singing
loud
crude
song
The
others
were
laughing
soft
ticking
noise
came
from
several
expensive
racing
bikes
that
they
were
wheeling
along
Harry
knew
who
those
people
were
The
figure
front
was
unmistakeably
his
cousin
Dudley
Dursley
wending
his
way
home
accompanied
his
faithful
gang
Dudley
was
vast
ever
but
year
hard
dieting
and
the
discovery
new
talent
had
wrought
quite
change
his
physique
Uncle
Vernon
delightedly
told
anyone
who
would
listen
Dudley
had
recently
become
the
Junior
Heavyweight
Inter
School
Boxing
Champion
the
Southeast
The
noble
sport
Uncle
Vernon
called
had
made
Dudley
even
more
formidable
than
had
seemed
Harry
their
primary
school
days
when
had
served
Dudley
first
punchball
Harry
was
not
remotely
afraid
his
cousin
any
more
but
still
didn
think
that
Dudley
learning
punch
harder
and
more
accurately
was
cause
for
celebration
Neighbourhood
children
all
around
were
terrified
him
even
more
terrified
than
they
were
that
Potter
boy
who
they
had
been
warned
was
hardened
hooligan
and
attended
Brutus
Secure
Centre
for
Incurably
Criminal
Boys
Harry
watched
the
dark
figures
crossing
the
grass
and
wondered
who
they
had
been
beating
tonight
Look
round
Harry
found
himself
thinking
watched
them
Come
look
round
sitting
here
all
alone
come
and
have
Dudley
friends
saw
him
sitting
here
they
would
sure
make
beeline
for
him
and
what
would
Dudley
then
wouldn
want
lose
face
front
the
gang
but
terrified
provoking
Harry
would
really
fun
watch
Dudley
dilemma
taunt
him
watch
him
with
him
powerless
respond
and
any
the
others
tried
hitting
Harry
was
ready
had
his
wand
Let
them
try
love
vent
some
his
frustration
the
boys
who
had
once
made
his
life
hell
But
they
didn
turn
around
they
didn
see
him
they
were
almost
the
railings
Harry
mastered
the
impulse
call
after
them
seeking
fight
was
not
smart
move
must
not
use
magic
would
risking
expulsion
again
The
voices
Dudley
gang
died
away
they
were
out
sight
heading
along
Magnolia
Road
There
you
Sirius
Harry
thought
dully
Nothing
rash
Kept
nose
clean
Exactly
the
opposite
what
you
have
done
got
his
feet
and
stretched
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
seemed
feel
that
whenever
Dudley
turned
was
the
right
time
home
and
any
time
after
that
was
much
too
late
Uncle
Vernon
had
threatened
lock
Harry
the
shed
came
home
after
Dudley
ever
again
stifling
yawn
and
still
scowling
Harry
set
off
towards
the
park
gate
Magnolia
Road
like
Privet
Drive
was
full
large
square
houses
with
perfectly
manicured
lawns
all
owned
large
square
owners
who
drove
very
clean
cars
similar
Uncle
Vernon
Harry
preferred
Little
Whinging
night
when
the
curtained
windows
made
patches
jewel
bright
colour
the
darkness
and
ran
danger
hearing
disapproving
mutters
about
his
delinquent
appearance
when
passed
the
householders
walked
quickly
that
halfway
along
Magnolia
Road
Dudley
gang
came
into
view
again
they
were
saying
their
farewells
the
entrance
Magnolia
Crescent
Harry
stepped
into
the
shadow
large
lilac
tree
and
waited
squealed
like
pig
didn
Malcolm
was
saying
guffaws
from
the
others
Nice
right
hook
Big
said
Piers
Same
time
tomorrow
said
Dudley
Round
place
parents
will
out
said
Gordon
See
you
then
said
Dudley
Bye
Dud
See
Big
Harry
waited
for
the
rest
the
gang
move
before
setting
off
again
When
their
voices
had
faded
once
more
headed
around
the
corner
into
Magnolia
Crescent
and
walking
very
quickly
soon
came
within
hailing
distance
Dudley
who
was
strolling
along
his
ease
humming
tunelessly
Hey
Big
Dudley
turned
grunted
you
How
long
have
you
been
Big
then
said
Harry
Shut
snarled
Dudley
turning
away
Cool
name
said
Harry
grinning
and
falling
into
step
beside
his
cousin
But
you
always
Ickle
Diddykins
said
SHUT
said
Dudley
whose
ham
like
hands
had
curled
into
fists
Don
the
boys
know
that
what
your
mum
calls
you
Shut
your
face
You
don
tellher
shut
her
face
What
about
Popkin
and
Dinky
Diddydums
can
use
them
then
Dudley
said
nothing
The
effort
keeping
himself
from
hitting
Harry
seemed
demand
all
his
self
control
who
you
been
beating
tonight
Harry
asked
his
grin
fading
Another
ten
year
old
know
you
did
Mark
Evans
two
nights
ago
was
asking
for
snarled
Dudley
yeah
cheeked
Yeah
Did
say
you
look
like
pig
that
been
taught
walk
its
hind
legs
Cause
that
not
cheek
Dud
that
true
muscle
was
twitching
Dudley
jaw
gave
Harry
enormous
satisfaction
know
how
furious
was
making
Dudley
felt
though
was
siphoning
off
his
own
frustration
into
his
cousin
the
only
outlet
had
They
turned
right
down
the
narrow
alleyway
where
Harry
had
first
seen
Sirius
and
which
formed
short
cut
between
Magnolia
Crescent
and
Wisteria
Walk
was
empty
and
much
darker
than
the
streets
linked
because
there
were
streetlamps
Their
footsteps
were
muffled
between
garage
walls
one
side
and
high
fence
the
other
Think
you
big
man
carrying
that
thing
don
you
Dudley
said
after
few
seconds
What
thing
That
that
thing
you
are
hiding
Harry
grinned
again
Not
stupid
you
look
are
you
Dud
But
pose
you
were
you
wouldn
able
walk
and
talk
the
same
time
Harry
pulled
out
his
wand
saw
Dudley
look
sideways
You
not
allowed
Dudley
said
once
know
you
not
You
get
expelled
from
that
freak
school
you
How
you
know
they
haven
changed
the
rules
Big
They
haven
said
Dudley
though
didn
sound
completely
convinced
Harry
laughed
softly
You
haven
got
the
guts
take
without
that
thing
have
you
Dudley
snarled
Whereas
you
just
need
four
mates
behind
you
before
you
can
beat
ten
year
old
You
know
that
boxing
title
you
keep
banging
about
How
old
was
your
opponent
Seven
Eight
was
sixteen
for
your
information
snarled
Dudley
and
was
out
cold
for
twenty
minutes
after
finished
with
him
and
was
twice
heavy
you
You
just
wait
till

Dad

Running

Dudley
This

Diddykins
That
what
call
when
goes
all
dark
like
this
mean
when
you
bed
Dudley
snarled
had
stopped
walking
Harry
stopped
too
staring
his
cousin
From
the
little
could
see
Dudley
large
face
was
wearing
strangely
triumphant
look
What
you
mean
not
brave
when
bed
said
Harry
completely
nonplussed
What
supposed
frightened
pillows
something
heard
you
last
night
said
Dudley
breathlessly
Talking
your
sleep
Moaning
What
you
mean
Harry
said
again
but
there
was
cold
plunging
sensation
his
stomach
had
revisited
the
graveyard
last
night
his
dreams
Dudley
gave
harsh
bark
laughter
then
adopted
high
pitched
whimpering
voice
Don
kill
Cedric
Don
kill
Cedric
Who
Cedric
your
boyfriend

lying
said
Harry
automatically
But
his
mouth
had
gone
dry
knew
Dudley
wasn
lying
how
else
would
know
about
Cedric
Dad
Help
Dad
going

Dad
Boo

said
Harry
quietly
Shut

warning
you

Cedric
Dad

going
Don
you
point
that
thing
Dudley
backed
into
the
alley
wall
Harry
was
pointing
the
wand
directly
Dudley
heart
Harry
could
feel
fourteen
years
hatred
Dudley
pounding
his
veins
what
wouldn
give
strike
now
jinx
Dudley
thoroughly
have
crawl
home
like
insect
struck
dumb
sprouting
feelers
Don
ever

again
Harry
snarled
you
understand
Point

thing
somewhere
else
said
you
understand
Point
somewhere
else
YOU
UNDERSTAND
GET
THAT
THING
AWAY
FROM
Dudley
gave
odd
shuddering
gasp
though
had
been
doused
icy
water
Something
had
happened
the
night
The
star
strewn
indigo
sky
was
suddenly
pitch
black
and
lightless
the
stars
the
moon
the
misty
streetlamps
either
end
the
alley
had
vanished
The
distant
rumble
cars
and
the
whisper
trees
had
gone
The
balmy
evening
was
suddenly
piercingly
bitingly
cold
They
were
surrounded
total
impenetrable
silent
darkness
though
some
giant
hand
had
dropped
thick
icy
mantle
over
the
entire
alleyway
blinding
them
For
split
second
Harry
thought
had
done
magic
without
meaning
despite
the
fact
that
been
resisting
hard
could
then
his
reason
caught
with
his
senses
didn
have
the
power
turn
off
the
stars
turned
his
head
this
way
and
that
trying
see
something
but
the
darkness
pressed
his
eyes
like
weightless
veil
Dudley
terrified
voice
broke
Harry
ear
what
are
you
doing
stop
not
doing
anything
Shut
and
don
move
can
see
gone
blind
said
shut
Harry
stood
stock
still
turning
his
sightless
eyes
left
and
right
The
cold
was
intense
was
shivering
all
over
goose
bumps
had
erupted
his
arms
and
the
hairs
the
back
his
neck
were
standing
opened
his
eyes
their
fullest
extent
staring
blankly
around
unseeing
was
impossible
they
couldn
here
not
Little
Whinging
strained
his
ears
would
hear
them
before
saw
them
tell
Dad
Dudley
whimpered
where
are
you
What
are
you
Will
you
shut
Harry
hissed
trying
lis
But
fell
silent
had
heard
just
the
thing
had
been
dreading
There
was
something
the
alleyway
apart
from
themselves
something
that
was
drawing
long
hoarse
rattling
breaths
Harry
felt
horrible
jolt
dread
stood
trembling
the
freezing
air
cut
out
Stop
doing
hit
you
swear
will
Dudley
shut
WHAM
fist
made
contact
with
the
side
Harry
head
lifting
him
off
his
feet
Small
white
lights
popped
front
his
eyes
For
the
second
time
hour
Harry
felt
though
his
head
had
been
cleaved
two
next
moment
had
landed
hard
the
ground
and
his
wand
had
flown
out
his
hand
You
moron
Dudley
Harry
yelled
his
eyes
watering
with
pain
scrambled
his
hands
and
knees
feeling
around
frantically
the
blackness
heard
Dudley
blundering
away
hitting
the
alley
fence
stumbling
DUDLEY
COME
BACK
YOU
RUNNING
RIGHT
There
was
horrible
squealing
yell
and
Dudley
footsteps
stopped
the
same
moment
Harry
felt
creeping
chill
behind
him
that
could
mean
only
one
thing
There
was
more
than
one
DUDLEY
KEEP
YOUR
MOUTH
SHUT
WHATEVER
YOU
KEEP
YOUR
MOUTH
SHUT
Wand
Harry
muttered
frantically
his
hands
flying
over
the
ground
like
spiders
Where
wand
come
lumos
said
the
spell
automatically
desperate
for
light
help
him
his
search
and
his
disbelieving
relief
light
flared
inches
from
his
right
hand
the
wand
tip
had
ignited
Harry
snatched
scrambled
his
feet
and
turned
around
His
stomach
turned
over
towering
hooded
figure
was
gliding
smoothly
towards
him
hovering
over
the
ground
feet
face
visible
beneath
its
robes
sucking
the
night
came
Stumbling
backwards
Harry
raised
his
wand
Expecto
patronum
silvery
wisp
vapour
shot
from
the
tip
the
wand
and
the
Dementor
slowed
but
the
spell
hadn
worked
properly
tripping
over
his
own
feet
Harry
retreated
further
the
Dementor
bore
down
upon
him
panic
fogging
his
brain
concentrate
pair
grey
slimy
scabbed
hands
slid
from
inside
the
Dementor
robes
reaching
for
him
rushing
noise
filled
Harry
ears
Expecto
patronum
His
voice
sounded
dim
and
distant
Another
wisp
silver
smoke
feebler
than
the
last
drifted
from
the
wand
couldn
any
more
couldn
work
the
spell
There
was
laughter
inside
his
own
head
shrill
high
pitched
laughter
could
smell
the
Dementor
putrid
death
cold
breath
filling
his
own
lungs
drowning
him
think
something
happy
But
there
was
happiness
him
the
Dementor
icy
fingers
were
closing
his
throat
the
high
pitched
laughter
was
growing
louder
and
louder
and
voice
spoke
inside
his
head
Bow
death
Harry
might
even
painless
would
not
know
have
never
died
was
never
going
see
Ron
and
Hermione
again
And
their
faces
burst
clearly
into
his
mind
fought
for
breath
EXPECTO
PATRONUM
enormous
silver
stag
erupted
from
the
tip
Harry
wand
its
antlers
caught
the
Dementor
the
place
where
the
heart
should
have
been
was
thrown
backwards
weightless
darkness
and
the
stag
charged
the
Dementor
swooped
away
bat
like
and
defeated
THIS
WAY
Harry
shouted
the
stag
Wheeling
around
sprinted
down
the
alleyway
holding
the
lit
wand
aloft
DUDLEY
DUDLEY
had
run
barely
dozen
steps
when
reached
them
Dudley
was
curled
the
ground
his
arms
clamped
over
his
face
second
Dementor
was
crouching
low
over
him
gripping
his
wrists
its
slimy
hands
prising
them
slowly
almost
lovingly
apart
lowering
its
hooded
head
towards
Dudley
face
though
about
kiss
him
GET
Harry
bellowed
and
with
rushing
roaring
sound
the
silver
stag
had
conjured
came
galloping
past
him
The
Dementor
eyeless
face
was
barely
inch
from
Dudley
when
the
silver
antlers
caught
the
thing
was
thrown
into
the
air
and
like
its
fellow
soared
away
andwas
absorbed
into
the
darkness
the
stag
cantered
the
end
the
alleyway
and
dissolved
into
silver
mist
Moon
stars
and
streetlamps
burst
back
into
life
warm
breeze
swept
the
alleyway
Trees
rustled
neighbouring
gardens
and
the
mundane
rumble
cars
Magnolia
Crescent
filled
the
air
again
Harry
stood
quite
still
all
his
senses
vibrating
taking
the
abrupt
return
normality
After
moment
became
aware
that
his
shirt
was
sticking
him
was
drenched
sweat
could
not
believe
what
had
just
happened
Dementors
here
Little
Whinging
Dudley
lay
curled
the
ground
whimpering
and
shaking
Harry
bent
down
see
whether
was
fit
state
stand
but
then
heard
loud
running
footsteps
behind
him
Instinctively
raising
his
wand
again
span
his
heel
face
the
newcomer
Mrs
Figg
their
batty
old
neighbour
came
panting
into
sight
Her
grizzled
grey
hair
was
escaping
from
its
hairnet
clanking
string
shopping
bag
was
swinging
from
her
wrist
and
her
feet
were
halfway
out
her
tartan
carpet
slippers
Harry
made
stow
his
wand
hurriedly
out

but

But
The
revelation
that

batty
old
cat

knew
what
Dementors
were
was
almost
big
shock
Harry
meeting
two
them
down
the
alleyway
You

She

and
tugged
Getup

But
Dudley
either
could

not

remained
the
ground
trembling
and
ashen
faced
his
mouth
shut
very
tight
Harry
took
hold
Dudley
arm
and
heaved
With
enormous
effort
managed
hoist
him
his
feet
Dudley
seemed
the
point
fainting
His
small
eyes
were
rolling
their
sockets
and
sweat
was
beading
his
face
the
moment
Harry
let
him
swayed
dangerously
Hurry
said
Mrs
Figg
hysterically
Harry
pulled
one
Dudley
massive
arms
around
his
own
shoulders
and
dragged
him
towards
the
road
sagging
slightly
under
the
weight
Mrs
Figg
tottered
along
front
them
peering
anxiously
around
the
corner
Keep

told
Harry

Harry

ribs
but
Dudley
seemed
have
lost
all
desire
for
independent
movement
was
slumped
Harry
shoulder
his
large
feet
dragging
along
the
ground
Why

Squib
Mrs
Figg
asked
Harry
panting
with
the
effort
keep
walking
All

wondering

within
seconds

readjusted

and
made

The

About

Harry
looked

Dudley
and
ducked
out
from

just
time
Dudley
swayed
the

for
moment
his
face
pale
green
then
opened
his

and
vomited
all
over

Harry
which
suited
him
perfectly
managed
slip
inside
just
before
Uncle
Vernon
slammed
the
door
and
while
the
Dursleys
made
their
noisy
progress
down
the
hall
towards
the
kitchen
Harry
moved
carefully
and
quietly
towards
the
stairs
Who

screwed
braced
for

explosion
BOY

With
feeling
mingled
dread
and
anger
Harry
removed
his
foot
slowly
from
the
stair
and
turned
follow
the
Dursleys
The
scrupulously
clean
kitchen
had
oddly
unreal
glitter
after
the
darkness
outside
Aunt
Petunia
was
ushering
Dudley
into
chair
was
still
very
green
and
clammy
looking
Uncle
Vernon
standing
front
the
draining
board
glaring
Harry
through
tiny
narrowed
eyes
What
have
you
done

said
menacing
growl
Nothing
said
Harry
knowing
perfectly
well
that
Uncle
Vernon
wouldn
believe
him
What

Aunt

quavering

from

Did

Slowly
tremulously
Dudley

said
sharply
Aunt

let
out
wail
and
Uncle
Vernon
raised
his
fists
didn
anything

But
that
precise
moment
screech
owl
swooped
through
the
kitchen
window
Narrowly
missing
the
top
Uncle
Vernon
head
soared
across
the
kitchen
dropped
the
large
parchment
envelope
was
carrying
its
beak
Harry
feet
turned
gracefully
the
tips
its
wings
just
brushing
the
top
the
fridge
then
zoomed
outside
again
and
off
across
the
garden
OWLS
bellowed
Uncle
Vernon
the
well
worn
vein
his
temple
pulsing
angrily
slammed
the
kitchen
window
shut
OWLS

But
Harry
was
already
ripping
open
the
envelope
and
pulling
out
the
letter
inside
his
heart
pounding
somewhere
the
region
his
Adam
apple

read
the
letter
through
twice
was
only
vaguely
aware
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
talking
Inside
his
head
all
was
icy
and
numb
One
fact
had
penetrated
his
consciousness
like
paralysing
dart
was
expelled
from
Hogwarts
was
all
over
was
never
going
back
looked
the
Dursleys
Uncle
Vernon
was
purple
faced
shouting
his
fists
still
raised
Aunt
Petunia
had
her
arms
around
Dudley
who
was
retching
again
Harry
temporarily
stupefied
brain
seemed
reawaken
Ministry

There

only
one

Where

but
was
certain
one
thing
Hogwarts
outside
needed
his
wand
almost
dreamlike
state
pulled
his
wand
out
and
turned
leave
the
kitchen
Where

Uncle

When
Harry
didn

pounded
across
the

block
the
doorway
into
the
hall
haven
finished
with
you
boy
Get

Harry
quietly
You

You

You

three
seconds
One
two
resounding
CRACK
filled
the
kitchen
Aunt
Petunia
screamed
Uncle
Vernon
yelled
and
ducked
but
for
the
third
time
that
night
Harry
was
searching
for
the
source
disturbance
had
not
made
spotted
once
dazed
and
ruffled
looking
barn
owl
was
sitting
outside
the
kitchen
sill
having
just
collided
with
the
closed
window
Ignoring
Uncle
Vernon
anguished
yell
OWLS
Harry
crossed
the
room
run
and
wrenched
the
window
open
The
owl
stuck
out
its
leg
which
small
roll
parchment
was
tied
shook
its
leathers
and
took
off
the
moment
Harry
had
taken
the
letter
Hands
shaking
Harry
unfurled
the
second
message
which
was
written
very
hastily
and
blotchily
black
ink
Harry
Dumbledore
just
arrived
the
Ministry
and
trying
sort
all
out
NOT
LEAVE
YOUR
AUNT
AND
UNCLE
HOUSE
NOT
ANY
MORE
MAGIC
NOT
SURRENDER
YOUR
WAND
Arthur
Weasley
Dumbledore
was
trying
sort
all
out
what
did
that
mean
How
much
power
did
Dumbledore
have
override
the
Ministry
Magic
Was
there
chance
that
might
allowed
back
Hogwarts
then
small
shoot
hope
burgeoned
Harry
chest
almost
immediately
strangled
panic
how
was
supposed
refuse
surrender
his
wand
without
doing
magic
have
duel
with
the
Ministry
representatives
and
did
that
lucky
escape
Azkaban
let
alone
expulsion
His
mind
was
racing
could
run
for
and
risk
being
captured
the
Ministry
stay
put
and
wait
for
them
find
him
here
was
much
more
tempted
the
former
course
but
knew
Weasley
had
his
best
interests
heart
and
after
all
Dumbledore
had
sorted
out
much
worse
than
this
before
Right
Harry
said
changed
mind
staying
flung
himself
down
the
kitchen
table
and
faced
Dudley
and
Aunt
Petunia
The
Dursleys
appeared
taken
aback
his
abrupt
change
mind
Aunt
Petunia
glanced
despairingly
Uncle
Vernon
The
vein
his
purple
temple
was
throbbing
worse
than
ever
Who
are
all
these
ruddy
owls
from
growled
The
first
one
was
from
the
Ministry
Magic
expelling
said
Harry
calmly
was
straining
his
ears
catch
any
noises
outside
case
the
Ministry
representatives
were
approaching
and
was
easier
and
quieter
answer
Uncle
Vernon
questions
than
have
him
start
raging
and
bellowing
The
second
one
was
from
friend
Ron
dad
who
works
the
Ministry
Ministry

bellowed
Uncle
Vernon
People
like

this
explains
everything
everything

the

going
the

When
Harry
did
not
respond
Uncle
Vernon
glared
him
then
spat
out
And
why
have
you
been
expelled
Because
did
magic
AHA
roared
Uncle
Vernon
slamming
his
fist
down
top
the
fridge
which
sprang
open
several
Dudley
low
fat
snacks
toppled
out
and
burst
the
floor

What

Nothing

Harry

That

Dudley
unexpectedly
and
Uncle

and
Aunt

instantly
made

gestures
Harry
quieten
him
while
they
both
bent
low
over
Dudley

said
Uncle
Vernon
what

Tell

Aunt
Petunia
Pointed
his

Uncle

and
Aunt
Petunia

repeated
Uncle
Vernon

blowing
about
furiously
All
went

Dudley
said
hoarsely
shuddering
Everything

And
then
heard
things
Inside
head
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
exchanged
looks
utter
horror
their
least
favourite
thing
the
world
was
magic
closely
followed
neighbours
who
cheated
more
than
they
did
the

ban
people
who
heard
voices
were
definitely
the
bottom
ten
They
obviously
thought
Dudley
was
losing
his
mind
What
sort
things
did
you
hear
Popkin
breathed
Aunt
Petunia
very
white
faced
and
with
tears
her
eyes
But
Dudley
seemed
incapable
saying
shuddered
again
and
shook
his
large
blond
head
and
despite
the
sense
numb
dread
that
had
settled
Harry
since
the
arrival
the
first
owl
felt
certain
curiosity
Dementors
caused
person
relive
the
worst
moments
their
life
What
would

Dudley
have
been
forced

adopt
the
bedside
very
ill

tripped
said
Dudley
shakily
And
then
gestured
his
massive
chest
Harry
understood
Dudley
was
remembering
the
clammy
cold
that
filled
the
lungs
hope
and
happiness
were
sucked
out
you
Horrible

Dudley
Cold

said
Aunt

Two
seconds
ringing
silence
followed
these
words
before
Aunt
Petunia
clapped
her
hand
over
her
mouth
though
she
had
let
slip
disgusting
swear
word
Uncle
Vernon
was
goggling
her
Harry

reeled

How

Aunt

looked
quite
appalled
with

She

then
lowered

her
horsy

tellingher
about

years

she
said
jerkily
you

mum
and
dad
why
don
you
use
their
names
said
Harry
loudly
but
Aunt
Petunia
ignored
him
She
seemed
horribly
flustered
Harry
was
stunned
Except
for
one
outburst
years
ago
the
course
which
Aunt
Petunia
had
screamed
that
Harry
mother
had
been
freak
had
never
heard
her
mention
her
sister
was
astounded
that
she
had
remembered
this
scrap
information
about
the
magical
world
for
long
when
she
usually
put
all
her
energies
into
pretending
didn
exist
Uncle
Vernon
opened
his
mouth
closed
again
opened
once

apparently
struggling

Aunt

nodded
Uncle

looked
from
Aunt

Dudley
Harry
hoping
somebody
was
going
shout
April
Fool
When
nobody
did
opened
his
mouth
yet
again
but
was
spared
the
struggle
find
more
words
the
arrival
the
third
owl
the
evening
zoomed
through
the
still
open
window
like
feathery
cannon
ball
and
landed
with
clatter
the
kitchen
table
causing
all
three
the
Dursleys
jump
with
fright
Harry
tore
second
official
looking
envelope
from
the
owls
beak
and
ripped
open
the
owl
swooped
back
out
into
the
night
Enough
effing

muttered
Uncle
Vernon
distractedly
stomping
over
the
window
and
slamming
shut
again

Harry
and
his
temper
red
and
gold
sparks
shot
out

clutched
his
hand
All

Dursleys

Harry

Then
two
Dementors
turned
But
what

Dementoids
asked
Uncle
Vernon
furiously
What
they
told
you
they
suck
all
the
happiness

you
said
Harry
and
they
get
the
chance
they
kiss
you
Kiss
you
said
Uncle
Vernon
his
eyes
popping
slightly
Kiss
you
what
they
call

Aunt
Petunia
uttered
soft
scream
His

She

Harry
through

Why

Uncle

Why

then
Because

the
Patronus
WHOOSH
With
clattering
whirring
wings
and
soft
fall
dust
fourth
owl
came
shooting
out
the
kitchen
fireplace
FOR
GOD
SAKE
roared
Uncle
Vernon
pulling
great
clumps
hair
out
his
moustache
something
hadn
been
driven
long
time
WILL
NOT
HAVE
OWLS
HERE
WILL
NOT
TOLERATE
THIS
TELL
YOU
But
Harry
was
already
pulling
roll
parchment
from
the
owl
leg
was
convinced
that
this
letter
had
from
Dumbledore
explaining
everything
the
Dementors
Mrs
Figg
what
the
Ministry
was
how
Dumbledore
intended
sort
everything
out
that
for
the
first
time
his
life
was
disappointed
see
Sirius
handwriting
Ignoring
Uncle
Vernon
ongoing
rant
about
owls
and
narrowing
his
eyes
against
second
cloud
dust
the
most
recent
owl
look
off
back
the
chimney
Harry
read
Sirius
message
Arthur
has
just
told
what
happened
Don
leave
the
house
again
whatever
you
Harry
found
this
such
inadequate
response
everything
that
had
happened
tonight
that
turned
the
piece
parchment
over
looking
for
the
rest
the
letter
but
there
was
nothing
else
And
now
his
temper
was
rising
again
Wasn
tanybody
going
say
well
done
for
fighting
off
two
Dementors
single
handed
Both
Weasley
and
Sirius
were
acting
though
misbehaved
and
were
saving
their
tellings
off
until
they
could
ascertain
how
much
damage
had
been
done
peck

shooting
and
out

Harry

tonight
barked
Uncle
Vernon
was
Demenders
who
hurt
Dudley
how
come
you

expelled
You
did
you
know
what
you
admitted
Harry
took
deep
steadying
breath
His
head
was
beginning
ache
again
wanted
more
than
anything
get
out
the
kitchen
and
away
from
the
Dursleys
did
the
Patronus
Charm
get
rid
the
Dementors
said
forcing
himself
remain
calm
the
only
thing
that
works
against
them
But
what
were
Dementoidsdoing
Little
Whinging
said
Uncle
Vernon
outraged
tone
Couldn
tell
you

Harry
wearily
idea
His
head
was
pounding
the
glare
the
strip
lighting
now
His
anger
was
ebbing
away
felt
drained
exhausted
The
Dursleys
were
all
staring
him
you
said
Uncle
Vernon
forcefully
got
something
with
you

Why
else
would
they
turn
here
Why

would

You

But

into

Howcould

that
they

the
alleyway
where
Harry
was
Had
they

Had

Dementors
Had
they

Yes
said
Harry
only
his
head
would
stop
hurting
only
could
just
leave
the
kitchen
and
get
his
dark
bedroom
andthink
Oho
They
were

Uncle

with
the
triumphant
air
man
reaching
unassailable
conclusion
That

You

said
Harry
shaking
his
head
though
scare
off
fly
his
mind
racing
now
Then
why
must
have
sent
them
said
Harry
quietly
more
himself
than
Uncle
Vernon
What
that
Who
must
have
sent
them
Lord
Voldemort
said
Harry
registered
dimly
how
strange
was
that
the
Dursleys
who
flinched
winced
and
squawked
they
heard
words
like
wizard
magic
wand
could
hear
the
name
the
most
evil
wizard
all
time
without
the
slightest
tremor
Lord
hang
said
Uncle
Vernon
his
face
screwed
look
dawning
comprehension
coming
into
his
piggy
eyes
heard
that
name
that
was
the
one
who
Murdered
parents
yes
Harry
said
dully
But
gone
said
Uncle
Vernon
impatiently
without
the
slightest
sign
that
the
murder
Harry
parents
might
painful
topic
That
giant
bloke
said
gone
back
said
Harry
heavily
felt
very
strange
standing
here
Aunt
Petunia
surgically
clean
kitchen
beside
the
top
the
range
fridge
and
the
wide
screen
television
talking
calmly
Lord
Voldemort
Uncle
Vernon
The
arrival
the
Dementors
Little
Whinging
seemed
have
breached
the
great
invisible
wall
that
divided
the
relentlessly
non
magical
world
Privet
Drive
and
the
world
beyond
Harry
two
lives
had
somehow
become
fused
and
everything
had
been
turned
upside
down
the
Dursleys
were
asking
for
details
about
the
magical
world
and
Mrs
Figg
knew
Albus
Dumbledore
Dementors
were
soaring
around
Little
Whinging
and
might
never
return
Hogwarts
Harry
head
throbbed
more
painfully
Back
whispered
Aunt
Petunia
She
was
looking
Harry
she
had
never
looked
him
before
And
all
sudden
for
the
very
first
time
his
life
Harry
fully
appreciated
that
Aunt
Petunia
was
his
mother
sister
could
not
have
said
why
this
hit
him
very
powerfully
this
moment
All
knew
was
that
was
not
the
only
person
the
room
who
had
inkling
what
Lord
Voldemort
being
back
might
mean
Aunt
Petunia
had
never
her
life
looked
him
like
that
before
Her
large
pale
eyes
unlike
her
sister
were
not
narrowed
dislike
anger
they
were
wide
and
fearful
The
furious
pretence
that
Aunt
Petunia
had
maintained
all
Harry
life
that
there
was
magic
and
world
other
than
the
world
she
inhabited
with
Uncle
Vernon
seemed
have
fallen
away
Yes
Harry
said
talking
directly
Aunt
Petunia
now
came
back
month
ago
saw
him
Her
hands
found
Dudley
massive
leather
clad
shoulders
and
clutched
them
Hang
said
Uncle
Vernon
looking
from
his
wife
Harry
and
back
again
apparently
dazed
and
confused
the
unprece
dented
understanding
that
seemed
have
sprung
between
them
Hang
This
Lord
Voldything
back
you
say
Yes
The
one
who
murdered
your
parents
Yes
And
now
sending
Dismembers
after
you
Looks
like
said
Harry
see
said
Uncle
Vernon
looking
from
his
white
faced
wife
Harry
and
hitching
his
trousers
seemed
swelling
his
great
purple
face
stretching
before
Harry
eyes
Well
that
settles
said
his
shirt
front
straining
inflated
himself
you
can
get
out
this
house
boy
What
said
Harry
You
heard

Uncle
Vernon
bellowed
and
even
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
jumped
OUT
OUT
should
done
this
years
ago
Owls
treating
the
place
like

OUT

You

You

You

some
loony
after

you
not
endangering

and
son
you
not
bringing
trouble
down
you
going
the
same
way
your
useless
parents
had
OUT
Harry
stood
rooted
the
spot
The
letters
from
the
Ministry
Weasley
and
Sirius
were
all
crushed
his
left
hand
Don
leave
the
house
again
whatever
you
NOT
LEAVE
YOUR
AUNT
AND
UNCLE
HOUSE
You
heard
said
Uncle
Vernon
bending
forwards
now
his
massive
purple
face
coming
close
Harry
actually
felt
flecks
spit
hit
his
face
Get
going
You
were
all
keen
leave
half
hour
ago
right
behind
you
Get
out
and
never
darken
our
doorstep
again
Why
ever
kept
you
the
first
place
don
know
Marge
was
right
should
have
been
the
orphanage
were
too
damn
soft
for
our
own
good
thought
could
squash
out
you
thought
could
turn
you
normal
but
you
been
rotten
from
the
beginning
and
had
enough
owls
The
fifth
owl
zoomed
down
the
chimney
fast
actually
hit
the
floor
before
zooming
into
the
air
again
with
loud
screech
Harry
raised
his
hand
seize
the
letter
which
was
scarlet
envelope
but
soared
straight
over
his
head
flying
directly
Aunt
Petunia
who
let
out
scream
and
ducked
her
arms
over
her
face
The
owl
dropped
the
red
envelope
her
head
turned
and
flew
straight
back
the
chimney
Harry
darted
forwards
pick
the
letter
but
Aunt
Petunia
beat
him
You
can
open
you
like
said
Harry
but
hear
what
says
anyway
That
Howler
Let
Petunia
roared
Uncle
Vernon
Don

said
Aunt
Petunia
shaking
voice
addressed
tome
Vernon
look
Mrs
Petunia
Dursley
The
Kitchen
Number
Four
Privet
Drive
She
caught
her
breath
horrified
The
red
envelope
had
begun
smoke
Open
Harry
urged
her
Get
over
with
happen
anyway
Aunt
Petunia
hand
was
trembling
She
looked
wildly
around
the
kitchen
though
looking
for
escape
route
but
too
late
the
envelope
burst
into
flames
Aunt
Petunia
screamed
and
dropped
awful
voice
filled
the
kitchen
echoing
the
confined
space
issuing
from
the
burning
letter
the
table
Remember
last
Petunia
Aunt
Petunia
looked
though
she
might
faint
She
sank
into
the
chair
beside
Dudley
her
face
her
hands
The
remains
the
envelope
smouldered
into
ash
the
silence
What
this
Uncle
Vernon
said
hoarsely
What
don
Petunia
Aunt
Petunia
said
nothing
Dudley
was
staring
stupidly
his
mother
his
mouth
hanging
open
The
silence
spiralled
horribly
Harry
was
watching
his
aunt
utterly
bewildered
his
head
throbbing
fit
burst
Petunia
dear
said
Uncle
Vernon
timidly
Petunia
She
raised
her
head
She
was
still
trembling
She
swallowed
The
boy
the
boy
will
have
stay
Vernon
she
said
weakly
what
stays
she
said
She
was
not
looking
Harry
She
got
her
feet
again
but
Petunia
throw
him
out
the
neighbours
will
talk
she
said
She
was
rapidly
regaining
her
usual
brisk
snappish
manner
though
she
was
still
very
pale
They
ask
awkward
questions
they
want
know
where
gone
have
keep
him
Uncle
Vernon
was
deflating
like
old
tyre
But
Petunia
dear
Aunt
Petunia
ignored
him
She
turned
Harry
You
stay
your
room
she
said
You
not
leave
the
house
Now
get
bed
Harry
didn
move
Who
was
that
Howler
from
Don
ask
questions
Aunt
Petunia
snapped
Are
you
touch
with
wizards
told
you
get
bed
What
did
mean
Remember
the
last
what
bed
How
come
YOU
HEARD
YOUR
AUNT
NOW
BED
THE
ADVANCE
GUARD
just
been
attacked
Dementors
and
might
expelled
from
Hogwarts
want
know
what
going
and
when
going
get
out
here
Harry
copied
these
words
three
separate
pieces
parchment
the
moment
reached
the
desk
his
dark
bedroom
addressed
the
first
Sirius
the
second
Ron
and
the
third
Hermione
His
owl
Hedwig
was
off
hunting
her
cage
stood
empty
the
desk
Harry
paced
the
bedroom
waiting
for
her
come
back
his
head
pounding
his
brain
too
busy
for
sleep
even
though
his
eyes
stung
and
itched
with
tiredness
His
back
ached
from
hauling
Dudley
home
and
the
two
lumps
his
head
where
the
window
and
Dudley
had
hit
him
were
throbbing
painfully
and
down
paced
consumed
with
anger
and
frustration
grinding
his
teeth
and
clenching
his
fists
casting
angry
looks
out
the
empty
star
strewn
sky
every
time
passed
the
window
Dementors
sent
get
him
Mrs
Figg
and
Mundungus
Fletcher
tailing
him
secret
then
suspension
from
Hogwarts
and
hearing
the
Ministry
Magic
and
still
one
was
telling
him
what
was
going
And
what
what
had
that
Howler
been
about
Whose
voice
had
echoed
horribly
menacingly
through
the
kitchen
Why
was
still
trapped
here
without
information
Why
was
everyone
treating
him
like
some
naughty
kid
Don
any
more
magic
stay
the
house
kicked
his
school
trunk
passed
but
far
from
relieving
his
anger
felt
worse
now
had
sharp
pain
his
toe
deal
with
addition
the
pain
the
rest
his
body
Just
limped
past
the
window
Hedwig
soared
through
with
soft
rustle
wings
like
small
ghost
About
time
Harry
snarled
she
landed
lightly
top
her
cage
You
can
put
that
down
got
work
for
you
Hedwig
large
round
amber
eyes
gazed
him
reproachfully
over
the
dead
frog
clamped
her
beak
Come
here
said
Harry
picking
the
three
small
rolls
parchment
and
leather
thong
and
tying
the
scrolls
her
scaly
leg
Take
these
straight
Sirius
Ron
and
Hermione
and
don
come
back
here
without
good
long
replies
Keep
pecking
them
till
they
written
decent
length
answers
you
got
Understand
Hedwig
gave
muffled
hooting
noise
her
beak
still
full
frog
Get
going
then
said
Harry
She
took
off
immediately
The
moment
she
gone
Harry
threw
himself
down
his
bed
without
undressing
and
stared
the
dark
ceiling
addition
every
other
miserable
feeling
now
felt
guilty
that
been
irritable
with
Hedwig
she
was
the
only
friend
had
number
four
Privet
Drive
But
make
her
when
she
came
back
with
the
answers
from
Sirius
Ron
and
Hermione
They
were
bound
write
back
quickly
they
couldn
possibly
ignore
Dementor
attack
probably
wake
tomorrow
three
fat
letters
full
sympathy
and
plans
for
his
immediate
removal
The
Burrow
And
with
that
comforting
idea
sleep
rolled
over
him
stifling
all
further
thought
But
Hedwig
didn
return
next
morning
Harry
spent
the
day
his
bedroom
leaving
only
the
bathroom
Three
times
that
day
Aunt
Petunia
shoved
food
into
his
room
through
the
cat
flap
Uncle
Vernon
had
installed
three
summers
ago
Every
time
Harry
heard
her
approaching
tried
question
her
about
the
Howler
but
might
well
have
interrogated
the
doorknob
for
all
the
answers
got
Otherwise
the
Dursleys
kept
well
clear
his
bedroom
Harry
couldn
see
the
point
forcing
his
company
them
another
row
would
achieve
nothing
except
perhaps
make
him
angry
perform
more
illegal
magic
went
for
three
whole
days
Harry
was
alternately
filled
with
restless
energy
that
made
him
unable
settle
anything
during
which
time
paced
his
bedroom
furious
the
whole
lot
them
for
leaving
him
stew
this
mess
and
with
lethargy
complete
that
could
lie
his
bed
for
hour
time
staring
dazedly
into
space
aching
with
dread
the
thought
the
Ministry
hearing
What
they
ruled
against
him
What
was
expelled
and
his
wand
was
snapped
half
What
would
where
would
could
not
return
living
full
time
with
the
Dursleys
not
now
knew
the
other
world
the
one
which
really
belonged
Might
able
move
into
Sirius
house
Sirius
had
suggested
year
ago
before
had
been
forced
flee
from
the
Ministry
Would
Harry
allowed
live
there
alone
given
that
was
still
underage
would
the
matter
where
went
next
decided
for
him
Had
his
breach
the
International
Statute
Secrecy
been
severe
enough
land
him
cell
Azkaban
Whenever
this
thought
occurred
Harry
invariably
slid
off
his
bed
and
began
pacing
again
the
fourth
night
after
Hedwig
departure
Harry
was
lying
one
his
apathetic
phases
staring
the
ceiling
his
exhausted
mind
quite
blank
when
his
uncle
entered
his
bedroom
Harry
looked
slowly
around
him
Uncle
Vernon
was
wearing
his
best
suit
and
expression
enormous
smugness
going
out
said
Sorry
that
say
your
aunt
Dudley
and
are
going
out
Fine
said
Harry
dully
looking
back
the
ceiling
You
are
not
leave
your
bedroom
while
are
away
You
are
not
touch
the
television
the
stereo
any
our
possessions
Right
You
are
not
steal
food
from
the
fridge
going
lock
your
door
You
that
Uncle
Vernon
glared
Harry
clearly
suspicious
this
lack
argument
then
stomped
out
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
Harry
heard
the
key
turn
the
lock
and
Uncle
Vernon
footsteps
walking
heavily
down
the
stairs
few
minutes
later
heard
the
slamming
car
doors
the
rumble
engine
and
the
unmistakeable
sound
the
car
sweeping
out
the
drive
Harry
had
particular
feeling
about
the
Dursleys
leaving
made
difference
him
whether
they
were
the
house
not
could
not
even
summon
the
energy
get
and
turn
his
bedroom
light
The
room
grew
steadily
darker
around
him
lay
listening
the
night
sounds
through
the
window
kept
open
all
the
time
waiting
for
the
blessed
moment
when
Hedwig
returned
The
empty
house
creaked
around
him
The
pipes
gurgled
Harry
lay
there
kind
stupor
thinking
nothing
suspended
misery
Then
quite
distinctly
heard
crash
the
kitchen
below
sat
bolt
upright
listening
intently
The
Dursleys
couldn
back
was
much
too
soon
and
any
case
hadn
heard
their
car
There
was
silence
for
few
seconds
then
voices
Burglars
thought
sliding
off
the
bed
his
feet
but
split
second
later
occurred
him
that
burglars
would
keep
their
voices
down
and
whoever
was
moving
around
the
kitchen
was
certainly
not
troubling
snatched
his
wand
from
the
bedside
table
and
stood
facing
his
bedroom
door
listening
with
all
his
might
Next
moment
jumped
the
lock
gave
loud
click
and
his
door
swung
open
Harry
stood
motionless
staring
through
the
open
doorway
the
dark
upstairs
landing
straining
his
ears
for
further
sounds
but
none
came
hesitated
for
moment
then
moved
swiftly
and
silently
out
his
room
the
head
the
stairs
His
heart
shot
upwards
into
his
throat
There
were
people
standing
the
shadowy
hall
below
silhouetted
against
the
streetlight
glowing
through
the
glass
door
eight
nine
them
all
far
could
see
looking
him
Lower
your
wand
boy
before
you
take
someone
eye
out
said
low
growling
voice
Harry
heart
was
thumping
uncontrollably
knew
that
voice
but
did
not
lower
his
wand
Professor
Moody
said
uncertainly
don
know
much
about
Professor
growled
the
voice
never
got
round
much
teaching
did
Get
down
here
want
see
you
properly
Harry
lowered
his
wand
slightly
but
did
not
relax
his
grip
nor
did
move
had
very
good
reason
suspicious
had
recently
spent
nine
months
what
had
thought
was
Mad
Eye
Moody
company
only
find
out
that
wasn
Moody
all
but
impostor
impostor
moreover
who
had
tried
kill
Harry
before
being
unmasked
But
before
could
make
decision
about
what
next
second
slightly
hoarse
voice
floated
upstairs
all
right
Harry
come
take
you
away
Harry
heart
leapt
knew
that
voice
too
though
hadn
heard
for
over
year
Professor
Lupin
said
disbelievingly
that
you
Why
are
all
standing
the
dark
said
third
voice
this
one
completely
unfamiliar
woman
Lumos
wand
tip
flared
illuminating
the
hall
with
magical
light
Harry
blinked
The
people
below
were
crowded
around
the
foot
the
stairs
gazing
him
intently
some
craning
their
heads
for
better
look
Remus
Lupin
stood
nearest
him
Though
still
quite
young
Lupin
looked
tired
and
rather
ill
had
more
grey
hairs
than
when
Harry
had
last
said
goodbye
him
and
his
robes
were
more
patched
and
shabbier
than
ever
Nevertheless
was
smiling
broadly
Harry
who
tried
smile
back
despite
his
state
shock
Oooh
looks
just
like
thought
would
said
the
witch
who
was
holding
her
lit
wand
aloft
She
looked
the
youngest
there
she
had
pale
heart
shaped
face
dark
twinkling
eyes
and
short
spiky
hair
that
was
violent
shade
violet
Wotcher
Harry
Yeah
see
what
you
mean
Remus
said
bald
black
wizard
standing
furthest
back
had
deep
slow
voice
and
wore
single
gold
hoop
his
ear
looks
exactly
like

Except

Lily

Mad
Eye
Moody
who
had
long
grizzled
grey
hair
and
large
chunk
missing
from
his
nose
was
squinting
suspiciously
Harry
through
his
mismatched
eyes
One
eye
was
small
dark
and
beady
the
other
large
round
and
electric
blue
the
magical
eye
that
could
see
through
walls
doors
and
the
back
Moody
own
head
Are
you
quite
sure
him
Lupin
growled
nice
lookout
bring
back
some
Death
Eater
impersonating
him
ought
ask
him
something
only
the
real
Potter
would
know
Unless
anyone
brought
any
Veritaserum
Harry
what
form
does
your
Patronus
take
Lupin
asked
stag
said
Harry
nervously
That

Mad
Eye
said
Lupin
Very
conscious
everybody
still
staring
him
Harry
descended
the
stairs
stowing
his
wand
the
back
pocket
his
jeans
came
Don

your
wand
there
boy
roared
Moody
What
ignited
Better

Who

the
violet
haired

asked
Mad

interestedly
Never

growled
Mad

stumped
off
towards
the
kitchen
And
saw
that
added
irritably
the
woman
rolled
her
eyes
towards
the
ceiling
Lupin
held
out
his
hand
and
shook
Harry
How
are
you
asked
looking
closely
Harry
fine
Harry
could
hardly
believe
this
was
real
Four
weeks
with
nothing
not
the
tiniest
hint
plan
remove
him
from
Privet
Drive
and
suddenly
whole
bunch
wizards
was
standing
matter
factly
the
house
though
this
was
long
standing
arrangement
glanced
the
people
surrounding
Lupin
they
were
still
gazing
avidly
him
felt
very
conscious
the
fact
that
had
not
combed
his
hair
for
four
days
you
really
lucky
the
Dursleys
are
out
mumbled
Lucky
said
the
violet
haired
woman
was
who
lured
them
out
the
way
Sent

Lupin
just
waiting
for

clear
Where

The
Burrow
Harry
asked
hopefully
Not
The
Burrow
said
Lupin
motioning
Harry
towards
the
kitchen
the
little
knot
wizards
followed
all
still
eyeing
Harry
curiously
Too
risky
set
Headquarters
somewhere
undetectable
taken
while
Mad
Eye
Moody
was
now
sitting
the
kitchen
table
swigging
from
hip
flask
his
magical
eye
spinning
all
directions
taking
the
Dursleys
many
labour
saving
appliances
This
Alastor
Moody
Harry
Lupin
continued
pointing
towards
Moody
Yeah

Harry
uncomfortably
felt
odd

And

Nymphadora
Don

the
young
witch
with
shudder
Tonks
Nymphadora
Tonks

Lupin
would
you

Tonks
And

indicated
the
tall
black
wizard
who
bowed
Elphias

The
wheezy

nodded
Dedalus
Diggle

before
squeaked
the
excitable
Diggle
dropping

Emmeline

Sturgis

And
Hestia
Jones
pink

black

witch
waved
from
next
the
toaster
Harry
inclined
his
head
awkwardly
each
them
they
were
introduced
wished
they
would
look
something
other
than
him
was
though
had
suddenly
been
ushered
stage
also
wondered
why
many
them
were
there
surprising
number
people
volunteered

and
get
you
said
Lupin
though
had
read
Harry
mind
the
corners
his
mouth
twitched
slightly
Yeah

more
the
better
said
Moody
darkly
your
guard
Potter
just
waiting
for
the
signal
tell
safe
set
off
said
Lupin
glancing
out
the
kitchen
window
got
about
fifteen
minutes
Veryclean
aren
they
these
Muggles
said
the
witch
called
Tonks
who
was
looking
around
the
kitchen
with
great
interest
dad
Muggle
born
and
right
old
slob
suppose
varies
just
does
with
wizards
yeah
said
Harry
Look
turned
back
Lupin
what
going
haven
heard
anything
from
anyone
what
Vol
Several
the
witches
and
wizards
made
odd
hissing
noises
Dedalus
Diggle
dropped
his
hat
again
and
Moody
growled
Shut
What
said
Harry
not
discussing
anything
here
too
risky
said
Moody
turning
his
normal
eye
Harry
His
magical
eye
remained
focusedon
the
ceiling
Damn
added
angrily
putting
hand
the
magical
eye
keeps
getting
stuck
ever
since
that
scum
wore
And
with
nasty
squelching
sound
much
like
plunger
being
pulled
from
sink
popped
out
his
eye
Mad
Eye
you
know
that
disgusting
don
you
said
Tonks
conversationally
Get
glass
water
would
you
Harry
requested
Moody
Harry
crossed
the
dishwasher
took
out
clean
glass
and
filled
with
water
the
sink
still
watched
eagerly
the
band
wizards
Their
relentless
staring
was
starting
annoy
him
Cheers
said
Moody
when
Harry
handed
him
the
glass
dropped
the
magical
eyeball
into
the
water
and
prodded
and
down
the
eye
whizzed
around
staring
them
all
turn
want
three
hundred
and
sixty
degrees
visibility
the
return
journey
How
getting
wherever
going
Harry
asked
Brooms
said
Lupin
Only
way
You
too
young
Apparate
they
watching
the
Floo
Network
and
more
than
our
life
worth
set
unauthorised
Portkey
Remus
says
you
good
flier
said
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
his
deep
voice
excellent
said
Lupin
who
was
checking
his
watch
Anyway
you
better
and
get
packed
Harry
want
ready
when
the
signal
comes
come
and
help
you
said
Tonks
brightly
She
followed
Harry
back
into
the
hall
and
the
stairs
looking
around
with
much
curiosity
and
interest
Funny
place
she
said
bit
too
clean
you
know
what
mean
Bit
unnatural
this
better
she
added
they
entered
Harry
bedroom
and
turned
the
light
His
room
was
certainly
much
messier
than
the
rest
the
house
Confined
for
four
days
very
bad
mood
Harry
had
not
bothered
tidying
after
himself
Most
the
books
owned
were
strewn
over
the
floor
where
tried
distract
himself
with
each
turn
and
thrown
aside
Hedwig
cage
needed
cleaning
out
and
was
starting
smell
and
his
trunk
lay
open
revealing
jumbled
mixture
Muggle
clothes
and
wizards
robes
that
had
spilled
the
floor
around
Harry
started
picking
books
and
throwing
them
hastily
into
his
trunk
Tonks
paused
his
open
wardrobe
look
critically
her
reflection
the
mirror
the
inside
the
door
You
know
don
think
violet
really
colour
she
said
pensively
tugging
lock
spiky
hair
you
think
makes
look
bit
peaky
said
Harry
looking
her
over
the
top
ofQuidditch
Teams
Britain
and
Ireland
Yeah
does
said
Tonks
decisively
She
screwed
her
eyes
strained
expression
though
she
was
struggling
remember
something
second
later
her
hair
had
turned
bubble
gum
pink
How
did
you
that
said
Harry
gaping
her
she
opened
her
eyes
again
Metamorphmagus
she
said
looking
back
her
reflection
and
turning
her
head
that
she
could
see
her
hair
from
all
directions
means
can
change
appearance
will
she
added
spotting
Harry
puzzled
expression
the
mirror
behind
her
was
born
one
got
top
marks
Concealment
and
Disguise
during
Auror
training
without
any
study
all
was
great
You
Auror
said
Harry
impressed
Being
Dark
wizard
catcher
was
the
only
career
ever
considered
after
Hogwarts
Yeah
said
Tonks
looking
proud
Kingsley
well
bit
higher
than
though
only
qualified
year
ago
Nearly
failed
Stealth
and
Tracking
dead
clumsy
did
you
hear
break
that
plate
when
arrived
downstairs
Can
you
learn
how
Metamorphmagus
Harry
asked
her
straightening
completely
forgetting
about
packing
Tonks
chuckled
Bet
you
wouldn
mind
hiding
that
scar
sometimes
Her
eyes
found
the
lightning
shaped
scar
Harry
forehead
wouldn
mind
Harry
mumbled
turning
away
did
not
like
people
staring
his
scar
Well
you
have
learn
the
hard
way
afraid
said
Tonks
Metamorphmagi
are
really
rare
they
born
not
made
Most
wizards
need
use
wand
potions
change
their
appearance
But
got
get
going
Harry
supposed
packing
she
added
guiltily
looking
around
all
the
mess
the
floor
yeah
said
Harry
grabbing
few
more
books
Don
stupid
much
quicker
pack
cried
Tonks
waving
her
wand
long
sweeping
movement
over
the
floor
Books
clothes
telescope
and
scales
all
soared
into
the
air
and
flew
pell
mell
into
the
trunk
not
very
neat
said
Tonks
walking
over
the
trunk
and
looking
down
the
jumble
inside
mums
got
this
knack
getting
stuff
fit
itself
neatly
she
even
gets
the
socks
fold
themselves
but
never
mastered
how
she
does
kind
flick
She
flicked
her
wand
hopefully
One
Harry
socks
gave
feeble
sort
wiggle
and
flopped
back
top
the
mess
the
trunk
well
said
Tonks
slamming
the
trunk
lid
shut
least
all
That
could
with
bit
cleaning
too
She
pointed
her
wand
Hedwig
cage
Scourgify
few
feathers
and
droppings
vanished
Well

Harry

inches
into
the

Holding

Tonks
made

across
the
room
and
out
the
door
ahead
them
Hedwig
cage
her
left
hand
Harry
followed
her
down
the
stairs
carrying
his
broomstick
Back
the
kitchen
Moody
had
replaced
his
eye
which
was
spinning
fast
after
its
cleaning
made
Harry
feel
sick
look
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
and
Sturgis
Podmore
were
examining
the
microwave
and
Hestia
Jones
was
laughing
potato
peeler
she
had
come
across
while
rummaging
the
drawers
Lupin
was
sealing
letter
addressed
the
Dursleys
Excellent
said
Lupin
looking
Tonks
and
Harry
entered
got
about
minute
think
should
probably
get
out
into
the
garden
ready
Harry
left
letter
telling
your
aunt
and
uncle
not
worry
They
won
said
Harry
that

safe
That
just
depress
them
and
you

them
next
summer
have
Lupin
smiled
but
made
answer
Come

boy
said
Moody
gruffly
beckoning
Harry
towards
him
with
his
wand
need
Disillusion
you
You
need
what
said
Harry
nervously
Disillusionment
Charm
said
Moody
raising
his
wand
Lupin
says
you
got
Invisibility
Cloak
but
won
stay
while
flying
this
disguise
you
better
Here
you
rapped
him
hard
the
top
the
head
and
Harry
felt
curious
sensation
though
Moody
had
just
smashed
egg
there
cold
trickles
seemed
running
down
his
body
from
the
point
the
wand
had
struck
Nice
one
Mad
Eye
said
Tonks
appreciatively
staring
Harry
midriff
Harry
looked
down
his
body
rather
what
had
been
his
body
for
didn
look
anything
like
his
any
more
was
not
invisible
had
simply
taken
the
exact
colour
and
texture
the
kitchen
unit
behind
him
seemed
have
become
human
chameleon
Come
said
Moody
unlocking
the
back
door
with
his
wand
They
all
stepped
outside
Uncle
Vernon
beautifully
kept
lawn
Clear
night
grunted
Moody
his
magical
eye
scanning
the
heavens
Could
done
with
bit
more
cloud
cover
Right
you
barked
Harry
going
flying
close
formation
Tonks
right
front
you
keep
close
her
tail
Lupin
covering
you
from
below
going
behind
you
The
rest
circling
don
break
ranks
for
anything
got
one
killed
that
likely
Harry
asked
apprehensively
but
Moody
ignored
him
the
others
keep
flying
don
stop
don
break
ranks
they
take
out
all
and
you
survive
Harry
the
rear
guard

keep
flying
east
and
they
join
you
Stop
being
cheerful
Mad
Eye

not
taking
this
seriously
said
Tonks
she
strapped
Harry
trunk
and
Hedwig
cage
into
harness
hanging
from
her
broom
just
telling
the
boy
the
plan
growled
Moody
Our
job
deliver
him
safely
Headquarters
and
die
the
attempt
one
going
die
said
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
his
deep
calming
voice
Mount
your
brooms
that
the
first
signal
said
Lupin
sharply
pointing
into
the
sky
Far
far
above
them
shower
bright
red
sparks
had
flared
among
the
stars
Harry
recognised
them
once
wand
sparks
swung
his
right
leg
over
his
Firebolt
gripped
its
handle
tightly
and
felt
vibrating
very
slightly
though
was
keen
was
the
air
once
more
Second
signal
let
said
Lupin
loudly
more
sparks
green
this
time
exploded
high
above
them
Harry
kicked
off
hard
from
the
ground
The
cool
night
air
rushed
through
his
hair
the
neat
square
gardens
Privet
Drive
fell
away
shrinking
rapidly
into
patchwork
dark
greens
and
blacks
and
every
thought
the
Ministry
hearing
was
swept
from
his
mind
though
the
rush
air
had
blown
out
his
head
felt
though
his
heart
was
going
explode
with
pleasure
was
flying
again
flying
away
from
Privet
Drive
been
fantasising
about
all
summer
was
going
home
for
few
glorious
moments

Hard

Muggle

Moody
from
behind
him
Tonks
swerved
and
Harry
followed
her
watching
his
trunk
swinging
wildly
beneath
her
broom
need
more
height
give
another
quarter
mile
Harry
eyes
watered
the
chill
they
soared
upwards
could
see
nothing
below
now
but
tiny
pinpricks
light
that
were
car
headlights
and
streetlamps
Two
those
tiny
lights
might
belong
Uncle
Vernon
car
the
Dursleys
would
heading
back
their
empty
house
right
now
full
rage
about
the
non
existent
Lawn
Competition
and
Harry
laughed
aloud
the
thought
though
his
voice
was
drowned
the
flapping
robes
the
others
the
creaking
the
harness
holding
his
trunk
and
the
cage
and
the
whoosh
the
wind
their
ears
they
sped
through
the
air

not
felt

Moody

Tonks
angrily

Mad

Harry
was
relieved
hear
her
say
this
his
hands
were
growing
numb
the
Firebolt
handle
wished
had
thought
put
coat
was
starting
shiver
They
altered
their
course
every
now
and
then
according
Mad
Eye
instructions
Harry
eyes
were
screwed
against
the
rush
icy
wind
that
was
starting
make
his
ears
ache
could
remember
being
this
cold
broom
only
once
before
during
the
Quidditch
match
against
Hufflepuff
his
third
year
which
had
taken
place
storm
The
guard
around
him
was
circling
continuously
like
giant
birds
prey
Harry
lost
track
time
wondered
how
long
they
had
been
flying
felt
like
hour
least
Turning
southwest
yelled
Moody
want
avoid
the
motorway
Harry
was
now
chilled
thought
longingly
the
snug
dry
interiors
the
cars
streaming
along
below
then
even
more
longingly
travelling
Floo
powder
might
uncomfortable
spin
around
fireplaces
but
was
least
warm
the
flames
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
swooped
around
him
bald
pate
and
earring
gleaming
slightly
the
moonlight
now
Emmeline
Vance
was
his
right
her
wand
out
her
head
turning
left
and
right
then
she
too
swooped
over
him
replaced
Sturgis
Podmore
ought
double
back
for
bit
just
make
sure
not
being
followed
Moody
shouted
ARE
YOU
MAD
MAD
EYE
Tonks
screamed
from
the
front
all
frozen
our
brooms
keep
going
off
course
not
going
get
there
until
next
week
Besides
nearly
there
now
Time
start
the
descent
came
Lupin
voice
Follow
Tonks
Harry
Harry
followed
Tonks
into
dive
They
were
heading
for
the
largest
collection
lights
had
yet
seen
huge
sprawling
crisscrossing
mass
glittering
lines
and
grids
interspersed
with
patches
deepest
black
Lower
and
lower
they
flew
until
Harry
could
see
individual
headlights
and
streetlamps
chimneys
and
television
aerials
wanted
reach
the
ground
very
much
though
felt
sure
someone
would
have
unfreeze
him
from
his
broom
Here
called
Tonks
and
few
seconds
later
she
had
landed
Harry
touched
down
right
behind
her
and
dismounted
patch
unkempt
grass
the
middle
small
square
Tonks
was
already
unbuckling
Harry
trunk
Shivering
Harry
looked
around
The
grimy
fronts
the
surrounding
houses
were
not
welcoming
some
them
had
broken
windows
glimmering
dully
the
light
from
the
streetlamps
paint
was
peeling
from
many
the
doors
and
heaps
rubbish
lay
outside
several
sets
front
steps
Where
are
Harry
asked
but
Lupin
said
quietly
minute
Moody
was
rummaging
his
cloak
his
gnarled
hands
clumsy
with
cold
Got
muttered
raising
what
looked
like
silver
cigarette
lighter
into
the
air
and
clicking
The
nearest
streetlamp
went
out
with
pop
clicked
the
unlighter
again
the
next
lamp
went
out
kept
clicking
until
every
lamp
the
square
was
extinguished
and
the
only
remaining
light
came
from
curtained
windows
and
the
sickle
moon
overhead
Borrowed
from
Dumbledore
growled
Moody
pocketing
the
Put
Outer
That
take
care
any
Muggles
looking
out
the
window
see
Now
come
quick
took
Harry
the
arm
and
led
him
from
the
patch
grass
across
the
road
and
the
pavement
Lupin
and
Tonks
followed
carrying
Harry
trunk
between
them
the
rest
the
guard
all
with
their
wands
out
flanking
them
The
muffled
pounding
stereo
was
coming
from
upper
window
the
nearest
house
pungent
smell
rotting
rubbish
came
from
the
pile
bulging
bin
bags
just
inside
the
broken
gate
Here
Moody
muttered
thrusting
piece
parchment
towards
Harry
Disillusioned
hand
and
holding
his
lit
wand
close
illuminate
the
writing
Read
quickly
and
memorise
Harry
looked
down
the
piece
paper
The
narrow
handwriting
was
vaguely
familiar
said
The
Headquarters
the
Order
the
Phoenix
may
found
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
London
NUMBER
TWELVE
GRIMMAULD
PLACE
What
the
Order
the
Harry
began
Not
here
boy
snarled
Moody
Wait
till
inside
pulled
the
piece
parchment
out
Harry
hand
and
set
fire
with
his
wand
tip
the
message
curled
into
flames
and
floated
the
ground
Harry
looked
around
the
houses
again
They
were
standing
outside
number
eleven
looked
the
left
and
saw
number
ten
the
right
however
was
number
thirteen
But
where
Think
about
what
you
just
memorised
said
Lupin
quietly
Harry
thought
and
sooner
had
reached
the
part
about
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
than
battered
door
emerged
out
nowhere
between
numbers
eleven
and
thirteen
followed
swiftly
dirty
walls
and
grimy
windows
was
though
extra
house
had
inflated
pushing
those
either
side
out
its
way
Harry
gaped
The
stereo
number
eleven
thudded
Apparently
the
Muggles
inside
hadn
felt
anything
Come
hurry
growled
Moody
prodding
Harry
the
back
Harry
walked
the
worn
stone
steps
staring
the
newly
materialised
door
Its
black
paint
was
shabby
and
scratched
The
silver
doorknocker
was
the
form
twisted
serpent
There
was
keyhole
letterbox
Lupin
pulled
out
his
wand
and
tapped
the
door
once
Harry
heard
many
loud
metallic
clicks
and
what
sounded
like
the
clatter
chain
The
door
creaked
open
Get
quick
Harry
Lupin
whispered
but
don
far
inside
and
don
touch
anything
Harry
stepped
over
the
threshold
into
the
almost
total
darkness
the
hall
could
smell
damp
dust
and
sweetish
rotting
smell
the
place
had
the
feeling
derelict
building
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
the
others
filing
behind
him
Lupin
and
Tonks
carrying
his
trunk
and
Hedwig
cage
Moody
was
standing
the
top
step
releasing
the
balls
light
the
Put
Outer
had
stolen
from
the
streetlamps
they
flew
back
their
bulbs
and
the
square
glowed
momentarily
with
orange
light
before
Moody
limped
inside
and
closed
the
front
door
that
the
darkness
the
hall
became
complete
Here
rapped
Harry
hard
over
the
head
with
his
wand
Harry
felt
though
something
hot
was
trickling
down
his
back
this
time
and
knew
that
the
Disillusionment
Charm
must
have
lifted
Now
stay
still
everyone
while
give
bit
light
here
Moody
whispered
The
others
hushed
voices
were
giving
Harry
odd
feeling
foreboding
was
though
they
had
just
entered
the
house
dying
person
heard
soft
hissing
noise
and
then
old
fashioned
gas
lamps
sputtered
into
life
all
along
the
walls
casting
flickering
insubstantial
light
over
the
peeling
wallpaper
and
threadbare
carpet
long
gloomy
hallway
where
cobwebby
chandelier
glimmered
overhead
and
age
blackened
portraits
hung
crooked
the
walls
Harry
heard
something
scuttling
behind
the
skirting
board
Both
the
chandelier
and
the
candelabra
rickety
table
nearby
were
shaped
like
serpents
There
were
hurried
footsteps
and
Ron
mother
Mrs
Weasley
emerged
from
door
the
far
end
the
hall
She
was
beaming
welcome
she
hurried
towards
them
though
Harry
noticed
that
she
was
rather
thinner
and
paler
than
she
had
been
last
time
had
seen
her
Harry
lovely
see
you
she
whispered
pulling
him
into
rib
cracking
hug
before
holding
him
arm
length
and
examining
him
critically
You
looking
peaky
you
need
feeding
but
you
have
wait
bit
for
dinner
afraid
She
turned
the
gang
wizards
behind
him
and
whispered
urgently
just
arrived
the
meeting
started
The
wizards
behind
Harry
all
made
noises
interest
and
excitement
and
began
filing
past
him
towards
the
door
through
which
Mrs
Weasley
had
just
come
Harry
made
follow
Lupin
but
Mrs
Weasley
held
him
back
Harry
the
meeting
only
for
members
the
Order
Ron
and
Hermione
are
upstairs
you
can
wait
with
them
until
the
meeting
over
then
have
dinner
And
keep
your
voice
down
the
hall
she
added
urgent
whisper
Why
don
want
anything
wake
What
you
explain
later
got
hurry
supposed
the
meeting
just
show
you
where
you
sleeping
Pressing
her
finger
her
lips
she
led
him
tiptoe
past
pair
long
moth
eaten
curtains
behind
which
Harry
supposed
there
must
another
door
and
after
skirting
large
umbrella
stand
that
looked
though
had
been
made
from
severed
troll
leg
they
started
the
dark
staircase
passing
row
shrunken
heads
mounted
plaques
the
wall
closer
look
showed
Harry
that
the
heads
belonged
house
elves
All
them
had
the
same
rather
snout
like
nose
Harry
bewilderment
deepened
with
every
step
took
What
earth
were
they
doing
house
that
looked
though
belonged
the
darkest
wizards
Mrs
Weasley
why
Ron
and
Hermione
will
explain
everything
dear
really
got
dash
Mrs
Weasley
whispered
distractedly
There
they
had
reached
the
second
landing
you
the
door
the
right
call
you
when
over
And
she
hurried
off
downstairs
again
Harry
crossed
the
dingy
landing
turned
the
bedroom
doorknob
which
was
shaped
like
serpent
head
and
opened
the
door
caught
brief
glimpse
gloomy
high
ceilinged
twin
bedded
room
then
there
was
loud
twittering
noise
followed
even
louder
shriek
and
his
vision
was
completely
obscured
large
quantity
very
bushy
hair
Hermione
had
thrown
herself
him
hug
that
nearly
knocked
him
flat
while
Ron
tiny
owl
Pigwidgeon
zoomed
excitedly
round
and
round
their
heads
HARRY
Ron
here
Harry
here
didn
hear
you
arrive
howare
you
Are
you
all
right
Have
you
been
furious
with
bet
you
have
know
our
letters
were
useless
but
couldn
tell
you
anything
Dumbledore
made
swear
wouldn
got
much
tell
you
and
you
got
things
tell
the
Dementors
When
heard
and
that
Ministry
hearing
just
outrageous
looked
all
they
can
expel
you
they
just
can
there
provision
the
Decree
for

for

life
threatening
situations
Let
him
breathe
Hermione
said
Ron
grinning
closed
the
door
behind
Harry
seemed
have
grown
several
more
inches
during
their
month
apart
making
him
taller
and
more
gangly
looking
than
ever
though
the
long
nose
bright
red
hair
and
freckles
were
the
same
Still
beaming
Hermione
let
Harry
but
before
she
could
say
another
word
there
was
soft
whooshing
sound
and
something
white
soared
from
the
top
dark
wardrobe
and
landed
gently
Harry
shoulder
Hedwig
The
snowy
owl
clicked
her
beak
and
nibbled
his
ear
affectionately
Harry
stroked
her
feathers
She
been
right
state
said
Ron
Pecked
half
death
when
she
brought
your
last
letters
look
this
showed
Harry
the
index
finger
his
right
hand
which
sported
half
healed
but
clearly
deep
cut
yeah
Harry
said
Sorry
about
that
but
wanted
answers
you
know
wanted
give
them
you
mate
said
Ron
Hermione
was
going
spare
she
kept
saying
you
something
stupid
you
were
stuck
all
your
own
without
news
but
Dumbledore
made
swear
not
tell
said
Harry
Yeah
Hermione
already
said
The
warm
glow
that
had
flared
inside
him
the
sight
his
two
best
friends
was
extinguished
something
icy
flooded
the
pit
his
stomach
All
sudden
after
yearning
see
them
for
solid
month
felt
would
rather
Ron
and
Hermione
left
him
alone
There
was
strained
silence
which
Harry
stroked
Hedwig
automatically
not
looking
either
the
others
seemed
think
was
best
said
Hermione
rather
breathlessly
Dumbledore
mean
Right
said
Harry
noticed
that
her
hands
too
bore
the
marks
Hedwig
beak
and
found
that
was
not
all
sorry
think
thought
you
were
safest
with
the
Muggles
Ron
began
Yeah
said
Harry
raising
his
eyebrows
Have
either
you
been
attacked
Dementors
this
summer
Well
but
that
why
had
people
from
the
Order
the
Phoenix
tailing
you
all
the
time
Harry
felt
great
jolt
his
guts
though
had
just
missed
step
going
downstairs
everyone
had
known
was
being
followed
except
him
Didn
work
that
well
though
did
said
Harry
doing
his
utmost
keep
his
voice
even
Had
look
after
myself
after
all
didn
was
angry
said
Hermione
almost
awestruck
voice
Dumbledore
saw
him
When
found
out
Mundungus
had
left
before
his
shift
had
ended
was
scary
Well
glad
left
Harry
said
coldly
hadn
wouldn
have
done
magic
and
Dumbledore
would
probably
have
left
Privet
Drive
all
summer
Aren
you
aren
you
worried
about
the
Ministry
Magic
hearing
said
Hermione
quietly
Harry
lied
defiantly
walked
away
from
them
looking
around
with
Hedwig
nestled
contentedly
his
shoulder
but
this
room
was
not
likely
raise
his
spirits
was
dank
and
dark
blank
stretch
canvas
ornate
picture
frame
was
all
that
relieved
the
bareness
the
peeling
walls
and
Harry
passed
thought
heard
someone
who
was
lurking
out
sight
snigger
why
Dumbledore
been
keen
keep
the
dark
Harry
asked
still
trying
hard
keep
his
voice
casual
Did
you
bother
ask
him
all
glanced
just
time
see
them
exchanging
look
that
told
him
was
behaving
just
they
had
feared
would
did
nothing
improve
his
temper
told
Dumbledore
wanted
tell
you
what
was
going
said
Ron
did
mate
But
really
busy
now
only
seen
him
twice
since
came
here
and
didn
have
much
time
just
made
swear
not
tell
you
important
stuff
when
wrote
said
the
owls
might
intercepted
could
still
kept
informed
wanted
Harry
said
shortly
You
not
telling
doesn
know
ways

messages
without
owls
Hermione
glanced
Ron
and
then
said
thought
that
too
But
didn
want
you
knowanything
Maybe
thinks
can
trusted
said
Harry
watching
their
expressions
Don
thick
said
Ron
looking
highly
disconcerted
that
can
take
care
myself
course
doesn
think
that
said
Hermione
anxiously
how
come
have
stay
the
Dursleys
while
you
two
get
join
everything
that
going
here
said
Harry
the
words
tumbling
over
one
another
rush
his
voice
growing
louder
with
every
word
How
come
you
two
are
allowed
know
everything
that
going
not
Ron
interrupted
Mum
won
let
near
the
meetings
she
says
too
young
But
before
knew
Harry
was
shouting
YOU

BEEN

WHO

PHILOSOPHER
STONE
WHO

RID
RIDDLE
WHO
SAVED
BOTH
YOUR
SKINS
FROM
THE
DEMENTORS
Every
bitter
and
resentful
thought
Harry
had
had
the
past
month
was
pouring
out
him
his
frustration
the
lack
news
the
hurt
that
they
had
all
been
together
without
him
his
fury
being
followed
and
not
told
about
all
the
feelings
was
half
ashamed
finally
burst
their
boundaries
Hedwig
took
fright
the
noise
and
soared
off
the
top
the
wardrobe
again
Pigwidgeon
twittered
alarm
and
zoomed
even
faster
around
their
heads
WHO

GET
PAST
DRAGONS
AND
SPHINXES
AND
EVERY
OTHER
FOUL
THING
LAST
YEAR
WHO

ESCAPE
FROM
HIM
Ron
was
standing
there
with
his
mouth
half
open
clearly
stunned
and
loss
for
anything
say
whilst
Hermione
looked
the
verge
tears
BUT
WHY
SHOULD
KNOW
WHAT
GOING
WHY
SHOULD
ANYONE
BOTHER
TELL

honest
Harry

said
Hermione
desperately
her
eyes
now
sparkling
with
tears
You

right
Harry
furious
was
Harry
glared
her
still
breathing
deeply
then
turned
away
from
them
again
pacing
and
down
Hedwig
hooted
glumly
from
the
top
the
wardrobe
There
was
long
pause
broken
only
the
mournful
creak
the
floorboards
below
Harry
feet
What

Ron
and
Hermione

Harry

Ron
with

again
looking
anywhere

Ron
and
Hermione

weakly
the

were
vividly
red
haired
Ron
though
stockier
and
slightly
shorter

George
beaming

You

then
asked
Harry
grumpily
With
distinction
said
Fred
who

holding

very
long

seconds
longer

Ron

Fred

response
Harry
raised
eyebrows
and
held
the
string
which
Harry
now
saw
was
trailing
out
the
landing
trying
hear
what
going
ondownstairs
You
want

said
Ron
staring
the
Ear

The

and
they
just

toget
under
the
gap
Fred
heaved
deep
sigh
Shame

Harry
quickly

George
carefully
closing

Fred

Hermione

Ron
snorted

said
Ginny
though
that
settled
the
matter
Harry
was
not
sure
his
anger
had
abated
yet
but
his
thirst
for
information
was
now
overcoming
his
urge
keep
shouting
sank
the
bed
opposite
the
others
Bill
here
asked
thought

working
Egypt

Fred
says

Romania
Dumbledore

Charlie
trying

Couldn
Percy
that
Harry
asked
The
last
had
heard
the
third
Weasley
brother
was
working
the
Department
International
Magical
operation
the
Ministry
Magic
Harry
words
all
the
Weasleys
and
Hermione
exchanged
darkly
significant
looks
Whatever
you
don
mention
Percy
front
Mum
and
Dad
Ron
told
Harry
tense
voice
Why
not
Because
every
time
Percy
name
mentioned
Dad
breaks
whatever
holding
and
Mum
starts
crying
Fred
said
been
awful
said
Ginny
sadly
think
well
shot
him
said
George
with
uncharacteristically
ugly
look
his
face
What
happened
Harry
said
Percy
and
Dad
had
row
said
Fred
never
seen
Dad
row
with
anyone
like
that
normally
Mum
who
shouts
was
the
first
week
back
after
term
ended
said
Ron
were
about
come
and
join
the
Order
Percy
came
home
and
told
been
promoted
You
kidding
said
Harry
Though
knew
perfectly
well
that
Percy
was
highly
ambitious
Harry
impression
was
that
Percy
had
not
made
great
success
his
first
job
the
Ministry
Magic
Percy
had
committed
the
fairly
large
oversight
failing
notice
that
his
boss
was
being
controlled
Lord
Voldemort
not
that
the
Ministry
had
believed
they
all
thought
Crouch
had
gone
mad
Yeah
were
all
surprised
said
George
because
Percy
got
into
load
trouble
about
Crouch
there
was
inquiry
and
everything
They
said
Percy
ought
have
realised
Crouch
was
off
his
rocker
and
informed
superior
But
you
know
Percy
Crouch
left
him
charge
wasn
going
complain
how
come
they
promoted
him
That
exactly
what
wondered
said
Ron
who
seemed
very
keen
keep
normal
conversation
going
now
that
Harry
had
stopped
yelling
came
home
really
pleased
with
himself
even
more
pleased
than
usual
you
can
imagine
that
and
told
Dad
been
offered
position
Fudge
own
office
really
good
one
for
someone
only
year
out
Hogwarts
Junior
Assistant
the
Minister
expected
Dad
all
impressed
think
Only
Dad
wasn
said
Fred
grimly
Why
not
said
Harry
Well
apparently
Fudge
has
been
storming
round
the
Ministry
checking
that
nobody
having
any
contact
with
Dumbledore
said
George
Dumbledore
name
mud
with
the
Ministry
these
days
see
said
Fred
They
all
think
just
making
trouble
saying
You
Know
Who
back
Dad
says
Fudge
has
made
clear
that
anyone
who
league
with
Dumbledore
can
clear
out
their
desks
said
George
Trouble
Fudge
suspects
Dad
knows
friendly
with
Dumbledore
and
always
thought
Dad
bit
weirdo
because
his
Muggle
obsession
But
what
that
got
with
Percy
asked
Harry
confused
coming
that
Dad
reckons
Fudge
only
wants
Percy
his
office
because
wants
use
him
spy
the
family
and
Dumbledore
Harry
let
out
low
whistle
Bet
Percy
loved
that
Ron
laughed
hollow
sort
way
went
completely
berserk
said
well
said
loads
terrible
stuff
said
been
having
struggle
against
Dad
lousy
reputation
ever
since
joined
the
Ministry
and
that
Dad
got
ambition
and
that
why
always
been
you
know
not
had
lot
money
mean
What
said
Harry
disbelief
Ginny
made
noise
like
angry
cat
know
said
Ron
low
voice
And
got
worse
said
Dad
was
idiot
run
around
with
Dumbledore
that
Dumbledore
was
heading
for
big
trouble
and
Dad
was
going
down
with
him
and
that
Percy
knew
where
his
loyalty
lay
and
was
with
the
Ministry
And
Mum
and
Dad
were
going
become
traitors
the
Ministry
was
going
make
sure
everyone
knew
didn
belong
our
family
any
more
And
packed
his
bags
the
same
night
and
left
living
here
London
now
Harry
swore
under
his
breath
had
always
liked
Percy

Ron
brothers
but
had
never
imagined

things
Weasley
Mum

Ron
dully

risk
everything
without
proof
Yeah

dragged
into
the
row
said
Ron
shooting
Harry
furtive
look
Percy
said
the
only
evidence
was
your
word
and
dunno
didn
think
was
good
enough
Percy
takes
theDaily
Prophet
seriously
said
Hermione
tartly
and
the
others
all
nodded
What

about
Harry
asked
looking
around
them
all
They
were
all
regarding
him
warily
Haven

Hermione
asked
nervously

anxiously
Not

Harry
defensively

They

Hermione
voice
forced
calm
They

But
she
not
writing
for
them
any
more
she
she
kept
her
promise
not
that
she
got
any
choice
Hermione
added
with
satisfaction
But
she
laid
the
foundation
for
what
they
trying
now
Which
what
said
Harry
impatiently
you
know
she
wrote
that
you
were
collapsing
all
over
the
place
and
saying

scar

all
that

Harry

Hermione
very
fast
though

unpleasant
for
Harry
hear
these
facts
quickly
They
keep
slipping
snide
comments
about
you
some
far
fetched
story

Harry
said
Ginny
earnestly
And

Dementors

Hermione
Someone

quiet
That

Dementors
They

hastily
You

They
were
back
the
hearing
and
Harry
did
not
want
think
about
that
cast
around
for
another
change
subject
but
was
saved
the
necessity
finding
one
the
sound
footsteps
coming
the
stairs
Fred
gave
the
Extendable
Ear
hearty
tug
there
was
another
loud
crack
and
and
George
vanished
Seconds
later
Mrs
Weasley
appeared
the
bedroom
doorway
The
meeting
over

can
come
down
and
have
dinner
now
Everyone
dying

Harry
And

Crookshanks

Ginny

Mrs

Now

voices
down
the
hall
Ginny

hands

before

Ginny
grimaced
the
others
and
followed
her
mother
out
the
room
leaving
Harry
alone
with
Ron
and
Hermione
Both
them
were
watching
him
apprehensively
though
they
feared
would
start
shouting
again
now
that
everyone
else
had
gone
The
sight
them
looking
nervous
made
him
feel
slightly
ashamed
Look
muttered
but
Ron
shook
his
head
and
Hermione
said
quietly
knew
you
angry
Harry
really
don
blame
you
but

understand
wedid
try
persuade
Dumbledore
Yeah

said
Harry
shortly
cast
around
for
topic
that
didn
involve
his
headmaster
because
the
very
thought
Dumbledore
made
Harry
insides
burn
with
anger
again
Who
Kreacher
asked
The
house
elf
who

said
Ron
Nutter
Never

Hermione
frowned
Ron

Ron
His

just
like

Ron
irritably
that

Hermione
Well

fault
Ron
rolled
his
eyes
Harry
Hermione

Hermione
heatedly
the
Society

Promotion
Elfish
Welfare
And
not

Dumbledore

Kreacher
too
Yeah
yeah
said
Ron
mon
starving
led
the
way
out
the
door
and
the
landing
but
before
they
could
descend
the
stairs
Hold
Ron
breathed
flinging
out
arm
stop
Harry
and
Hermione
walking
any
further
They
still
the
hall
might
able
hear
something
The
three
them
looked
cautiously
over
the
banisters
The
gloomy
hallway
below
was
packed
with
witches
and
wizards
including
all
Harry
guard
They
were
whispering
excitedly
together
the
very
centre
the
group
Harry
saw
the
dark
greasy
haired
head
and
prominent
nose
his
least
favourite
teacher
Hogwarts
Professor
Snape
Harry
leant
further
over
the
banisters
was
very
interested
what
Snape
was
doing
for
the
Order
the
Phoenix
thin
piece
flesh
coloured
string
descended
front
Harry
eyes
Looking
saw
Ered
and
George
the
landing
above
cautiously
lowering
the
Extendable
Ear
towards
the
dark
knot
people
below
moment
later
however
they
all
began
move
towards
the
front
door
and
out
sight
Dammit
Harry
heard
Fred
whisper
hoisted
the
Extendable
Ear
back
again
They
heard
the
front
door
open
then
close
Snape
never
eats
here
Ron
told
Harry
quietly
Thank
God
mon
And
don
forget
keep
your
voice
down
the
hall
Harry
Hermione
whispered
they
passed
the
row
house
elf
heads
the
wall
they
saw
Lupin
Mrs
Weasley
and
Tonks
the
front
door
magically
sealing
its
many
locks
and
bolts
behind
those
who
had
just
left
eating
down
the
kitchen
Mrs
Weasley
whispered
meeting
them
the
bottom
the
stairs
Harry
dear
you
just
tiptoe
across
the
hall
through
this
door
here
CRASH
Tonks
cried
Mrs
Weasley
exasperation
turning
look
behind
her
sorry
wailed
Tonks
who
was
lying
flat
the
floor
that
stupid
umbrella
stand
that
the
second
time
tripped
over
But
the
rest
her
words
were
drowned
horrible
ear
splitting
blood
curdling
screech
The
moth
eaten
velvet
curtains
Harry
had
passed
earlier
had
flown
apart
but
there
was
door
behind
them
For
split
second
Harry
thought
was
looking
through
window
window
behind
which
old
woman
black
cap
was
screaming
and
screaming
though
she
were
being
tortured
then
realised
was
simply
life
size
portrait
but
the
most
realistic
and
the
most
unpleasant
had
ever
seen
his
life
The
old
woman
was
drooling
her
eyes
were
rolling
the
yellowing
skin
her
face
stretched
taut
she
screamed
and
all
along
the
hall
behind
them
the
other
portraits
awoke
and
began
yell
too
that
Harry
actually
screwed
his
eyes
the
noise
and
clapped
his
hands
over
his
ears
Lupin
and
Mrs
Weasley
darted
forward
and
tried
tug
the
curtains
shut
over
the
old
woman
but
they
would
not
close
and
she
screeched
louder
than
ever
brandishing
clawed
hands
though
trying
tear
their
faces
Filth
Scum
products
dirt
and
vileness
Half
breeds
mutants
freaks
begone
from
this
place
How
dare
you
befoul
the
house
fathers
Tonks
apologized
over
and
over
again
dragging
the
huge
heavy
troll
leg
back
off
the
floor
Mrs
Weasley
abandoned
the
attempt
close
the
curtains
and
hurried
and
down
the
hall
stunning
all
the
other
portraits
with
her
wand
and
man
with
long
black
hair
came
charging
out
door
facing
Harry
Shut
you
horrible
old
hag
shut
roared
seizing
the
curtain
Mrs
Weasley
had
abandoned
The
old
woman
face
blanched
Yoooou
she
howled
her
eyes
popping

Blood
traitor
abomination
shame
flesh
said
shut
roared
the
man
and
with
stupendous
effort
and
Lupin
managed
force
the
curtains
closed
again
The
old
woman
screeches
died
and
echoing
silence
fell
Panting
slightly
and
sweeping
his
long
dark
hair
out
his
eyes
Harry
godfather
Sirius
turned
face
him
Hello
Harry
said
grimly
see

met
mother
THE
ORDER
THE
PHOENIX
Your
dear
old
mum

Sirius

her

but

Permanent
Sticking
Charm

back
the
canvas
Let

downstairs
quick
before
they
all
wake
again
But
what
portrait
your
mother
doing
here
Harry
asked
bewildered
they
went
through
the
door
from
the
hall
and
led
the
way
down
flight
narrow
stone
steps
the
others
just
behind
them
Hasn
anyone
told
you
This
was
parents
house
said
Sirius
But
the
last
Black
left
mine
now
offered
Dumbledore
for
Headquarters
about
the
only
useful
thing
been
able
Harry
who
had
expected
better
welcome
noted
how
hard
and
bitter
Sirius
voice
sounded
followed
his
godfather
the
bottom
the
steps
and
through
door
leading
into
the
basement
kitchen
was
scarcely
less
gloomy
than
the
hall
above
cavernous
room
with
rough
stone
walls
Most
the
light
was
coming
from
large
fire
the
far
end
the
room
haze
pipe
smoke
hung
the
air
like
battle
fumes
through
which
loomed
the
menacing
shapes
heavy
iron
pots
and
pans
hanging
from
the
dark
ceiling
Many
chairs
had
been
crammed
into
the
room
for
the
meeting
and
long
wooden
table
stood
the
middle
them
littered
with
rolls
parchment
goblets
empty
wine
bottles
and
heap
what
appeared
rags
Weasley
and
his
eldest
son
Bill
were
talking
quietly
with
their
heads
together
the
end
the
table
Mrs
Weasley
cleared
her
throat
Her
husband
thin
balding
red
haired
man
who
wore
horn
rimmed
glasses
looked
around
and
jumped
his
feet
Harry
Weasley
said
hurrying
forward
greet
him
and
shaking
his
hand
vigorously
Good
see
you
Over
his
shoulder
Harry
saw
Bill
who
still
wore
his
long
hair
ponytail
hastily
rolling
the
lengths
parchment
left
the
table
Journey
all
right
Harry
Bill
called
trying
gather
twelve
scrolls
once
Mad
Eye
didn
make
you
come
via
Greenland
then

said
Tonks
striding
over
help
Bill
and
immediately
toppling
candle
the
last
piece
parchment
sorry
Here
dear
said
Mrs
Weasley
sounding
exasperated
and
she
repaired
the
parchment
with
wave
her
wand
the
flash
light
caused
Mrs
Weasley
charm
Harry
caught
glimpse
what
looked
like
the
plan
building
Mrs
Weasley
had
seen
him
looking
She
snatched
the
plan
off
the
table
and
stuffed
into
Bill
already
overladen
arms
This
sort
thing
ought
cleared
away
promptly
the
end
meetings
she
snapped
before
sweeping
off
towards
ancient
dresser
from
which
she
started
unloading
dinner
plates
Bill
took
out
his
wand
muttered
Evanesco
and
the
scrolls
vanished
Sit
down
Harry
said
Sirius
You
met
Mundungus
haven
you
The
thing
Harry
had
taken
pile
rags
gave
prolonged
grunting
snore
then
jerked
awake
Some
say
name
Mundungus
mumbled
sleepily
gree
with
Sirius
raised
very
grubby
hand
the
air
though
voting
his
droopy
bloodshot
eyes
unfocused
Ginny
giggled
The
meeting
over
Dung
said
Sirius
they
all
sat
down
around
him
the
table
Harry
arrived
said
Mundungus
peering
balefully
Harry
through
his
matted
ginger
hair
Blimey
Yeah

all
right
Arry
Yeah
said
Harry
Mundungus
fumbled
nervously
his
pockets
still
staring
Harry
and
pulled
out
grimy
black
pipe
stuck
his
mouth
ignited
the
end
with
his
wand
and
took
deep
pull
Great
billowing
clouds
greenish
smoke
obscured
him
within
seconds
Owe
you
pology
grunted
voice
from
the
middle
the
smelly
cloud
For
the
last
time
Mundungus
called
Mrs
Weasley
will
you
please
not
smoke
that
thing
the
kitchen
especially
not
when
about
eat
said
Mundungus
Right
Sorry
Molly
The
cloud
smoke
vanished
Mundungus
stowed
his
pipe
back
his
pocket
but
acrid
smell
burning
socks
lingered
And
you
want
dinner
before
midnight
need

Mrs
Weasley
said
the
room
large
you
can
stay
where
you
are
Harry
dear

had
long
journey
What

Molly
said
Tonks
enthusiastically
bounding
forwards
Mrs
Weasley
hesitated
looking
apprehensive
all
right
Tonks
you
have
rest
too
you
done
enough
today
want
help
said
Tonks
brightly
knocking
over
chair
she
hurried
towards
the
dresser
from
which
Ginny
was
collecting
cutlery
Soon
series
heavy
knives
were
chopping
meat
and
vegetables
their
own
accord
supervised
Weasley
while
Mrs
Weasley
stirred
cauldron
dangling
over
the
fire
and
the
others
took
out
plates
more
goblets
and
food
from
the
pantry
Harry
was
left
the
table
with
Sirius
and
Mundungus
who
was
still
blinking
him
mournfully
Seen
old
Figgy
since
asked
said
Harry
haven
seen
anyone
See
wouldn
ave
left
said
Mundungus
leaning
forward
pleading
note
his
voice
but
business
opportunity
Harry
felt
something
brush
against
his
knees
and
started
but
was
only
Crookshanks
Hermione
bandy
legged
ginger
cat
who
wound
himself
once
around
Harry
legs
purring
then
jumped
Sirius
lap
and
curled
Sirius
scratched
him
absent
mindedly
behind
the
ears
turned
still
grim
faced
Harry
Had
good
summer
far
been
lousy
said
Harry
For
the
first
time
something
like
grin
flitted
across
Sirius
face
Don
know
what
you
complaining
about
myself
What
said
Harry
incredulously
Personally
have
welcomed
Dementor
attack
deadly
struggle
for
soul
would
have
broken
the
monotony
nicely
You
think
you
had
bad
least
you
been
able
get
out
and
about
stretch
your
legs
get
into
few
fights
been
stuck
inside
for
month
How
come
asked
Harry
frowning
Because
the
Ministry
Magic
still
after
and
Voldemort
will
know
all
about
being
Animagus
now
Wormtail
will
have
told
him
big
disguise
useless
There
not
much
can
for
the
Order
the
Phoenix
Dumbledore
feels
There
was
something
about
the
slightly
flattened
tone
voice
which
Sirius
uttered
Dumbledore
name
that
told
Harry
that
Sirius
too
was
not
very
happy
with
the
Headmaster
Harry
felt
sudden
upsurge
affection
for
his
godfather
least
you
known
what
been
going
said
bracingly
yeah
said
Sirius
sarcastically
Listening
Snape
reports
having
take
all
his
snide
hints
that
out
there
risking
his
life
while
sat
backside
here
having
nice
comfortable
time
asking
how
the
cleanings
going
What
cleaning
asked
Harry
Trying
make
this
place
fit
for
human
habitation
said
Sirius
waving
hand
around
the
dismal
kitchen
one
lived
here
for
ten
years
not
since
dear
mother
died
unless
you
count
her
old
house
elf
and
gone
round
the
twist
hasn
cleaned
anything
ages
Sirius
said
Mundungus
who
did
not
appear
have
paid
any
attention
the
conversation
but
had
been
closely
examining
empty
goblet
This
solid
silver
mate
Yes
said
Sirius
surveying
with
distaste
Finest
fifteenth
century
goblin
wrought
silver
embossed
with
the
Black
family
crest
That
come
orf
though
muttered
Mundungus
polishing
with
his
cuff
Fred
George
JUST
CARRY
THEM
Mrs
Weasley
shrieked
Harry
Sirius
and
Mundungus
looked
round
and
within
split
second
they
had
dived
away
from
the
table
Fred
and
George
had
bewitched
large
cauldron
stew
iron
flagon
Butterbeer
and
heavy
wooden
breadboard
complete
with
knife
hurtle
through
the
air
towards
them
The
stew
skidded
the
length
the
table
and
came
halt
just
before
the
end
leaving
long
black
burn
the
wooden
surface
the
flagon
Butterbeer
fell
with
crash
spilling
its
contents
everywhere
the
bread
knife
slipped
off
the
board
and
landed
point
down
and
quivering
ominously
exactly
where
Sirius
right
hand
had
been
seconds
before
FOR
HEAVEN
SAKE
screamed
Mrs
Weasley
THERE
WAS
NEED
HAD
ENOUGH
THIS
JUST
BECAUSE
YOU
ALLOWED
USE
MAGIC
NOW
YOU
DON
HAVE
WHIP
YOUR
WANDS
OUT
FOR
EVERY
TINY
LITTLE
THING
were
just
trying
save
bit
time
said
Fred
hurrying
forward
wrench
the
bread
knife
out
the
table
Sorry
Sirius
mate
didn
mean
Harry
and
Sirius
were
both
laughing
Mundungus
who
had
toppled
backwards
off
his
chair
was
swearing
got
his
feet
Crookshanks
had
given
angry
hiss
and
shot
off
under
the
dresser
from
where
his
large
yellow
eyes
glowed
the
darkness
Boys
Weasley
said
lifting
the
stew
back
into
the
middle
the
table
your
mother
right
you
supposed
show
sense
responsibility
now
you
come
age
None
your
brothers
caused
this
sort
trouble
Mrs
Weasley
raged
the
twins
she
slammed
fresh
flagon
Butterbeer
the
table
and
spilling
almost
much
again
Bill
didn
feel
the
need
Apparate
every
few
feet
Charlie
didn
charm
everything
met
Percy
She
stopped
dead
catching
her
breath
with
frightened
look
her
husband
whose
expression
was
suddenly
wooden
Let
eat
said
Bill
quickly
looks
wonderful
Molly
said
Lupin
ladling
stew
plate
for
her
and
handing
across
the
table
For
few
minutes
there
was
silence
but
for
the
chink
plates
and
cutlery
and
the
scraping
chairs
everyone
settled
down
their
food
Then
Mrs
Weasley
turned
Sirius
been
meaning
tell
you
Sirius
there
something
trapped
that
writing
desk
the
drawing
room
keeps
rattling
and
shaking
course
could
just
Boggart
but
thought
ought
ask
Alastor
have
look
before
let
out
Whatever

like
said
Sirius
indifferently
The
curtains
there
are
full
Doxys
too
Mrs
Weasley
went
thought
might
try
and
tackle
them
tomorrow
look
forward
said
Sirius
Harry
heard
the
sarcasm
his
voice
but
was
not
sure
that
anyone
else
did
Opposite
Harry
Tonks
was
entertaining
Hermione
and
Ginny
transforming
her
nose
between
mouthfuls
Screwing
her
eyes
each
time
with
the
same
pained
expression
she
had
worn
back
Harry
bedroom
her
nose
swelled
beak
like
protuberance
that
resembled
Snape
shrank
the
size
button
mushroom
and
then
sprouted
great
deal
hair
from
each
nostril
Apparently
this
was
regular
mealtime
entertainment
because
Hermione
and
Ginny
were
soon
requesting
their
favourite
noses
that
one
like
pig
snout
Tonks
Tonks
obliged
and
Harry
looking
had
the
fleeting
impression
that
female
Dudley
was
grinning
him
from
across
the
table
Weasley
Bill
and
Lupin
were
having
intense
discussion
about
goblins
They
not
giving
anything
away
yet
said
Bill
still
can
work
out
whether
not
they
believe
back
Course
they
might
prefer
not
take
sides
all
Keep
out
sure
they
never
over
You
Know
Who
said
Weasley
shaking
his
head
They
suffered
losses
too

that
goblin
family
murdered
last
time
somewhere
near
Nottingham
think
depends
what
they
offered
said
Lupin
And
not
talking
about
gold
they
offered
the
freedoms
been
denying
them
for
centuries
they
going
tempted
Have
you
still
not
had
any
luck
with
Ragnok
Bill
feeling
pretty
anti
wizard
the
moment
said
Bill
hasn
stopped
raging
about
the
Bagman
business
reckons
the
Ministry
did
cover
those
goblins
never
got
their
gold
from
him
you
know
gale
laughter
from
the
middle
the
table
drowned
the
rest
Bill
words
Fred
George
Ron
and
Mundungus
were
rolling
around
their
seats
and
then
choked
Mundungus
tears
running
down
his
face
and
then
you
believe
says
says
Ere
Dung
where
didja
get
all
them
toads
from
Cos

son
Bludger

and

And
says
Nicked

your
toads
Will

more

And

gormless
gargoyle

first
place

any
more

business
dealings
thank

very
much
Mundungus
said
Mrs
Weasley
sharply
Ron
slumped
forwards
the
table
howling
with
laughter
Beg
pardon
Molly
said
Mundungus
once
wiping
his
eyes
and
winking
Harry
But
you
know
Will
nicked
orf
Warty
Harris
the
first
place
wasn
really
doing
nothing
wrong
don
know
where
you
learned
about
right
and
wrong
Mundungus
but
you
seem
have
missed
few
crucial
lessons
said
Mrs
Weasley
coldly
Fred
and
George
buried
their
faces
their
goblets
Butterbeer
George
was
hiccoughing
For
some
reason
Mrs
Weasley
threw
very
nasty
look
Sirius
before
getting
her
feet
and
going
fetch
large
rhubarb
crumble
for
pudding
Harry
looked
round
his
godfather
Molly
doesn
approve
Mundungus
said
Sirius
undertone
How
come
the
Order
Harry
said
very
quietly
useful
Sirius
muttered
Knows
all
the
crooks
well
would
seeing
one
himself
But
also
very
loyal
Dumbledore
who
helped
him
out
tight
spot
once
pays
have
someone
like
Dung
around
hears
things
don
But
Molly
thinks
inviting
him
stay
for
dinner
going
too
far
She
hasn
forgiven
him
for
slipping
off
duty
when
was
supposed
tailing
you
Three
helpings
rhubarb
crumble
and
custard
later
and
the
waistband
Harry
jeans
was
feeling
uncomfortably
tight
which
was
saying
something
the
jeans
had
once
been
Dudley
laid
down
his
spoon
there
was
lull
the
general
conversation
Weasley
was
leaning
back
his
chair
looking
replete
and
relaxed
Tonks
was
yawning
widely
her
nose
now
back
normal
and
Ginny
who
had
lured
Crookshanks
out
from
under
the
dresser
was
sitting
cross
legged
the
floor
rolling
Butterbeer
corks
for
him
chase
Nearly
time
for
bed
think
said
Mrs
Weasley
with
yawn
Not
just
yet
Molly
said
Sirius
pushing
away
his
empty
plate
and
turning
look
Harry
You
know
surprised
you
thought
the
first
thing
you
when
you
got
here
would
start
asking
questions
about
Voldemort
The
atmosphere
the
room
changed
with
the
rapidity
Harry
associated
with
the
arrival
Dementors
Where
seconds
before
had
been
sleepily
relaxed
was
now
alert
even
tense
frisson
had
gone
around
the
table
the
mention
Voldemort
name
Lupin
who
had
been
about
take
sip
wine
lowered
his
goblet
slowly
looking
wary
did
said
Harry
indignantly
asked
Ron
and
Hermione
but
they
said
not
allowed
the
Order
And
they
quite
right
said
Mrs
Weasley
You
too
young
She
was
sitting
bolt
upright
her
chair
her
fists
clenched
its
arms
every
trace
drowsiness
gone
Since
when
did
someone
have
the
Order
the
Phoenix
ask
questions
asked
Sirius
Harry
been
trapped
that
Muggle
house
for
month
got
the
right
know
what
been

Hang
interrupted
George
loudly
How
come
Harry
gets
his
questions
answered
said
Fred
angrily
been
trying
get
stuff
out
you
for
month
and
you
haven
told
single
stinking
thing
said
George
You
too
young
you

the
Order
said
Fred
high
pitched
voice
that
sounded
uncannily
like
his
mother
Harry
not
even
age
not
fault
you
haven
been
told
what
the
Order

said
Sirius
calmly
that
your
parents
decision
Harry
the
other
hand
not
down
you
decide
what
good
for
Harry
said
Mrs
Weasley
sharply
The
expression
her
normally
kind
face
looked
dangerous
You
haven
forgotten
what
Dumbledore
said
suppose
Which
bit
Sirius
asked
politely
but
with
the
air
man
readying
himself
for
fight
The
bit
about
not
telling
Harry
more
than
heneeds
know
said
Mrs
Weasley
placing
heavy
emphasis
the
last
three
words
Ron
Hermione
Fred
and
George
heads
swivelled
from
Sirius
Mrs
Weasley
though
they
were
following
tennis
rally
Ginny
was
kneeling
amid
pile
abandoned
Butterbeer
corks
watching
the
conversation
with
her
mouth
slightly
open
Lupin
eyes
were
fixed
Sirius
don
intend
tell
him
more
than
heneeds
know
Molly
said
Sirius
But
was
the
one
who
saw
Voldemort
come
back
again
there
was
collective
shudder
around
the
table
the
name
has
more
right
than
most
not
member
the
Order
the
Phoenix
said
Mrs
Weasley
only
fifteen
and
And
dealt
with
much
most
the
Order
said
Sirius
and
more
than
some
one
denying
what
done
said
Mrs
Weasley
her
voice
rising
her
fists
trembling
the
arms
her
chair
But
still
not
child
said
Sirius
impatiently
not
adult
either
said
Mrs
Weasley
the
colour
rising
her
cheeks
not
James
Sirius
perfectly
clear
who
thanks
Molly
said
Sirius
coldly
not
sure
you
are
said
Mrs
Weasley
Sometimes
the
way
you
talk
about
him
though
you
think
you
got
your
best
friend
back
What
wrong
with
that
said
Harry
What
wrong
Harry
that
you
arenot
your
father
however
much
you
might
look
like
him
said
Mrs
Weasley
her
eyes
still
boring
into
Sirius
You
are
still
school
and
adults
responsible
for
you
should
not
forget
Meaning
irresponsible
godfather
demanded
Sirius
his
voice
rising
Meaning
you
have
been
known
act
rashly
Sirius
which
why
Dumbledore
keeps
reminding
you
stay
home
and
leave
instructions
from
Dumbledore
out
this
you
please
said
Sirius
loudly
Arthur
said
Mrs
Weasley
rounding
her
husband
Arthur
back
Weasley
did
not
speak
once
took
off
his
glasses
and
cleaned
them
slowly
his
robes
not
looking
his
wife
Only
when
had
replaced
them
carefully
his
nose
did
reply
Dumbledore
knows
the
position
has
changed
Molly
accepts
that
Harry
will
have
filled
certain
extent
now
that
staying
Headquarters
Yes
but
there
difference
between
that
and
inviting
him
ask
whatever
likes
Personally
said
Lupin
quietly
looking
away
from
Sirius
last
Mrs
Weasley
turned
quickly
him
hopeful
that
finally
she
was
about
get
ally
think
better
that
Harry
gets
the
facts
not
all
the
facts
Molly
but
the
general
picture
from
rather
than
garbled
version
from
others
His
expression
was
mild
but
Harry
felt
sure
Lupin
least
knew
that
some
Extendable
Ears
had
survived
Mrs
Weasley
purge
Well
said
Mrs
Weasley
breathing
deeply
and
looking
around
the
table
for
support
that
did
not
come
well
can
see
going
overruled
just
say
this
Dumbledore
must
have
had
his
reasons
for
not
wanting
Harry
know
too
much
and
speaking
someone
who
has
Harry
best
interests
heart
not
your
son
said
Sirius
quietly
good
said
Mrs
Weasley
fiercely
Who
else
has
got
got
Yes
said
Mrs
Weasley
her
lip
curling
the
thing
been
rather
difficult
for
you
look
after
him
while
you
been
locked
Azkaban
hasn
Sirius
started
rise
from
his
chair
Molly
you
not
the
only
person
this
table
who
cares
about
Harry
said
Lupin
sharply
Sirius
sitdown
Mrs
Weasley
lower
lip
was
trembling
Sirius
sank
slowly
back
into
his
chair
his
face
white
think
Harry
ought
allowed
say
this
Lupin
continued
old
enough
decide
for
himself
want
know
what
been
going
Harry
said
once
did
not
look
Mrs
Weasley
had
been
touched
what
she
had
said
about
his
being
good
son
but
was
also
impatient
with
her
mollycoddling
Sirius
was
right
wasnot
child
Very
well
said
Mrs
Weasley
her
voice
cracking
Ginny
Ron
Hermione
Fred
George
want
you
out
this
kitchen
now
There
was
instant
uproar
age
Fred
and
George
bellowed
together
Harry
allowed
why
can
shouted
Ron
Mum
Iwant
hear
wailed
Ginny
shouted
Mrs
Weasley
standing
her
eyes
overbright
absolutely
forbid
Molly
you
can
stop
Fred
and
George
said
Weasley
wearily
Theyare
age
They
still
school
But
they
legally
adults
now
said
Weasley
the
same
tired
voice
Mrs
Weasley
was
now
scarlet
the
face
all
right
then
Fred
and
George
can
stay
but
Ron
Harry
tell
and
Hermione
everything
you
say
anyway
said
Ron
hotly
Won
won
you
added
uncertainly
meeting
Harry
eyes
For
split
second
Harry
considered
telling
Ron
that
wouldn
tell
him
single
word
that
could
try
taste
being
kept
the
dark
and
see
how
liked
But
the
nasty
impulse
vanished
they
looked
each
other
Course
will
Harry
said
Ron
and
Hermione
beamed
Fine
shouted
Mrs
Weasley
Fine
Ginny
BED
Ginny
did
not
quietly
They
could
hear
her
raging
and
storming
her
mother
all
the
way
the
stairs
and
when
she
reached
the
hall
Mrs
Black
ear
splitting
shrieks
were
added
the
din
Lupin
hurried
off
the
portrait
restore
calm
was
only
after
had
returned
closing
the
kitchen
door
behind
him
and
taking
his
seat
the
table
again
that
Sirius
spoke
Harry
what
you
want
know
Harry
took
deep
breath
and
asked
the
question
that
had
obsessed
him
for
the
last
month
Where
Voldemort
said
ignoring
the
renewed
shudders
and
winces
the
name
What
doing
been
trying
watch
the
Muggle
news
and
there
hasn
been
anything
that
looks
like
him
yet
funny
deaths
anything
That
because
there
haven
been
any
funny
deaths
yet
said
Sirius
not
far
know
anyway
and
know
quite
lot
More
than
thinks
anyway
said
Lupin
How
come
stopped
killing
people
Harry
asked
knew
Voldemort
had
murdered
more
than
once
the
last
year
alone
Because
doesn
want
draw
attention
himself
said
Sirius
would
dangerous
for
him
His
comeback
didn
come
off
quite
the
way
wanted
you
see
messed
rather
you
messed
tip
for
him
said
Lupin
with
satisfied
smile
How
Harry
asked
perplexed
You
weren
supposed
survive
said
Sirius
Nobody
apart
from
his
Death
Eaters
was
supposed
know
come
back
But
you
survived
bear
witness
And
the
very
last
person
wanted
alerted
his
return
the
moment
got
back
was
Dumbledore
said
Lupin
And
you
made
sure
Dumbledore
knew
once
How
has
that
helped
Harry
asked
Are
you
kidding
said
Bill
incredulously
Dumbledore
was
the
only
one
You
Know
Who
was
ever
scared
Thanks
you
Dumbledore
was
able
recall
the
Order
the
Phoenix
about
hour
after
Voldemort
returned
said
Sirius
what
the
Order
been
doing
said
Harry
looking
around
them
all
Working
hard
can
make
sure
Voldemort
can
carry
out
his
plans
said
Sirius
How
you
know
what
his
plans
are
Harry
asked
quickly
Dumbledore
got
shrewd
idea
said
Lupin
and
Dumbledore
shrewd
ideas
normally
turn
out
accurate
what
does
Dumbledore
reckon
planning
Well
firstly
wants
build
his
army
again
said
Sirius
the
old
days
had
huge
numbers
his
command
witches
and
wizards
bullied
bewitched
into
following
him
his
faithful
Death
Eaters
great
variety
Dark
creatures
You
heard
him
planning
recruit
the
giants
well
they
just
one
the
groups
after
certainly
not
going
try
and
take
the
Ministry
Magic
with
only
dozen
Death
Eaters
you
trying
stop
him
getting
more
followers
doing
our
best
said
Lupin
How
Well
the
main
thing
try
and
convince
many
people
possible
that
You
Know
Who
really
has
returned
put
them
their
guard
said
Bill
proving
tricky
though
Why
Because
the
Ministry
attitude
said
Tonks
You
saw
Cornelius
Fudge
after
You
Know
Who
came
back
Harry
Well
hasn
shifted
his
position
all
absolutely
refusing
believe
happened
But
why
said
Harry
desperately
Why
being
stupid
Dumbledore
well
you
put
your
finger
the
problem
said
Weasley
with
wry
smile
Dumbledore
Fudge
frightened
him
you
see
said
Tonks
sadly
Frightened
Dumbledore
said
Harry
incredulously
Frightened
what
said
Weasley
Fudge
thinks
Dumbledore
plotting
overthrow
him
thinks
Dumbledore
wants
Minister
for
Magic
But
Dumbledore
doesn
want
course
doesn
said
Weasley
never
wanted
the
Minister
job
even
though
lot
people
wanted
him
take
when
Millicent
Bagnold
retired
Fudge
came
power
instead
but
never
quite
forgotten
how
much
popular
support
Dumbledore
had
even
though
Dumbledore
never
applied
for
the
job
Deep
down
Fudge
knows
Dumbledore
much
cleverer
than
much
more
powerful
wizard
and
the
early
days
his
Ministry
was
forever
asking
Dumbledore
for
help
and
advice
said
Lupin
But
seems
become
fond
power
and
much
more
confident
loves
being
Minister
for
Magic
and
managed
convince
himself
that
the
clever
one
and
Dumbledore
simply
stirring
trouble
for
the
sake
How
can
think
that
said
Harry
angrily
How
can
think
Dumbledore
would
just
make
all
thatI
dmake
all
Because
accepting
that
Voldemort
back
would
mean
trouble
like
the
Ministry
hasn
had
cope
with
for
nearly
fourteen
years
said
Sirius
bitterly
Fudge
just
can
bring
himself
face
much
more
comfortable
convince
himself
Dumbledore
lying
destabilise
him
You
see
the
problem
said
Lupin
While
the
Ministry
insists
there
nothing
fear
from
Voldemort
hard
convince
people
back
especially
they
really
don
want
believe
the
first
place
What
more
the
Ministry
leaning
heavily
theDaily
Prophet
not
report
any
what
they
calling
Dumbledore
rumour
mongering
most
the
wizarding
community
are
completely
unaware
any
things
happened
and
that
makes
them
easy
targets
for
the
Death
Eaters
they
using
the
Imperius
Curse
But
you
telling
people
aren
you
said
Harry
looking
around
Weasley
Sirius
Bill
Mundungus
Lupin
and
Tonks
You
letting
people
know
back
They
all
smiled
humourlessly
Well
everyone
thinks
mad
mass
murderer
and
the
Ministry
put
ten
thousand
Galleon
price
head
can
hardly
stroll
the
street
and
start
handing
out
leaflets
can
said
Sirius
restlessly
And
not
very
popular
dinner
guest
with
most
the
community
said
Lupin
occupational
hazard
being
werewolf
Tonks
and
Arthur
would
lose
their
jobs
the
Ministry
they
started
shooting
their
mouths
off
said
Sirius
and
very
important
for
have
spies
inside
the
Ministry
because
you
can
bet
Voldemort
will
have
them
managed
convince
couple
people
though
said
Weasley
Tonks
here
for
one
she
too
young
have
been
the
Order
the
Phoenix
last
time
and
having
Aurors
our
side
huge
advantage
Kingsley
Shacklebolt

charge
thehunt
for
Sirius
been
feeding
the
Ministry
information
that
Sirius
Tibet
But
none
you
are
putting
the
news
out
that
Voldemort
back
Harry
began
Who
said
none
are
putting
the
news
out
said
Sirius
Why
you
think
Dumbledore
such
trouble
What
you
mean
Harry
asked
They
trying
discredit
him
said
Lupin
Didn
you
see
theDaily
Prophet
last
week
They
reported
that
been
voted
out
the
Chairmanship
the
International
Confederation
Wizards
because
getting
old
and
losing
his
grip
but
not
true

Ministry

after
made
speech
announcing
Voldemort
return
They
demoted
him
from
Chief
Warlock
the
Wizengamot
that
the
Wizard
High
Court
and
they
talking
about
taking
away
his
Order
Merlin
First
Class
too
But
Dumbledore
says
doesn
care
what
they
long
they
don
take
him
off
the
Chocolate
Frog
Cards
said
Bill
grinning
laughing
matter
said
Weasley
sharply
carries
defying
the
Ministry
like
this
could
end
Azkaban
and
the
last
thing
want
have
Dumbledore
locked
While
You
Know
Who
knows
Dumbledore
out
there
and
wise
what
going
cautiously
Dumbledore
out
the
way
well
You
Know
Who
will
have
clear
field
But
Voldemort
trying
recruit
more
Death
Eaters
bound
get
out
that
come
back
isn
asked
Harry
desperately
Voldemort
doesn
march
people
houses
and
bang
their
front
doors
Harry
said
Sirius
tricks
jinxes
and
blackmails
them
well
practised
operating
secret
any
case
gathering
followers
only
one
thing
interested
got
other
plans
too
plans
can
put
into
operation
very
quietly
indeed
and
concentrating
those
for
the
moment
What
after
apart
from
followers
Harry
asked
swiftly
thought
saw
Sirius
and
Lupin
exchange
the
most
fleeting
looks
before
Sirius
answered
Stuff
can
only
get
stealth
When
Harry
continued
look
puzzled
Sirius
said
Like
weapon
Something
didn
have
last
time
When
was
powerful
before
Yes
Like
what
kind
weapon
said
Harry
Something
worse
than
the
Avada
Kedavra
That
enough
Mrs
Weasley
spoke
from
the
shadows
beside
the
door
Harry
hadn
noticed
her
return
from
taking
Ginny
upstairs
Her
arms
were
crossed
and
she
looked
furious
want
you
bed
now
All
you
she
added
looking
around
Fred
George
Ron
and
Hermione
You
can
boss
Fred
began
Watch
snarled
Mrs
Weasley
She
was
trembling
slightly
she
looked
Sirius
You
given
Harry
plenty
information
Any
more
and
you
might
just
well
induct
him
into
the
Order
straightaway
Why
not
said
Harry
quickly
join
want
join
want
fight
was
not
Mrs
Weasley
who
spoke
this
time
but
Lupin
The
Order
comprised
only
overage
wizards
said
Wizards
who
have
left
school
added
Fred
and
George
opened
their
mouths
There
are
dangers
involved
which
you
can
have
idea
any
you
think
Molly
right
Sirius
said
enough
Sirius
half
shrugged
but
did
not
argue
Mrs
Weasley
beckoned
imperiously
her
sons
and
Hermione
One
one
they
stood
and
Harry
recognising
defeat
followed
suit
THE
NOBLE
AND
MOST
ANCIENT
HOUSE
BLACK
Mrs
Weasley
followed
them
upstairs
looking
grim
want
you
all
straight
bed
talking
she
said
they
reached
the
first
landing
got
busy
day
tomorrow
expect
Ginny
asleep
she
added
Hermione
try
not
wake
her
Asleep
yeah
right
said
Fred
undertone
after
Hermione
bade
them
goodnight
and
they
were
climbing
the
next
floor
Ginny
not
lying
awake
waiting
for
Hermione
tell
her
everything
they
said
downstairs
then
Flobberworm
All
right
Ron
Harry
said
Mrs
Weasley
the
second
landing
pointing
them
into
their
bedroom
Off
bed
with
you
Night
Harry
and
Ron
said
the
twins
Sleep
tight
said
Fred
winking
Mrs
Weasley
closed
the
door
behind
Harry
with
sharp
snap
The
bedroom
looked
anything
even
danker
and
gloomier
than
had
first
sight
The
blank
picture
the
wall
was
now
breathing
very
slowly
and
deeply
though
its
invisible
occupant
was
asleep
Harry
put
his
pyjamas
took
off
his
glasses
and
climbed
into
his
chilly
bed
while
Ron
threw
Owl
Treats
top
the
wardrobe
pacify
Hedwig
and
Pigwidgeon
who
were
clattering
around
and
rustling
their
wings
restlessly
can
let
them
out
hunt
every
night
Ron
explained
pulled
his
maroon
pyjamas
Dumbledore
doesn
want
too
many
owls
swooping
around
the
square
thinks
look
suspicious
yeah
forgot
crossed
the
door
and
bolted
What
you
doing
that
for
Kreacher
said
Ron
turned
off
the
light
First
night
was
here
came
wandering
three
the
morning
Trust
you
don
want
wake
and
find
him
prowling
around
your
room
Anyway
got
into
his
bed
settled
down
under
the
covers
then
turned
look
Harry
the
darkness
Harry
could
see
his
outline
the
moonlight
filtering
through
the
grimy
window
what
you
reckon
Harry
didn
need
ask
what
Ron
meant
Well
they
didn
tell
much
couldn
have
guessed
did
they
said
thinking
all
that
had
been
said
downstairs
mean
all
they
really
said
that
the
Order
trying
stop
people
joining
Vol
There
was
sharp
intake
breath
from
Ron
demort
said
Harry
firmly
When
are
you
going
start
using
his
name
Sirius
and
Lupin
Ron
ignored
this
last
comment
Yeah
you
right
said
already
knew
nearly
everything
they
told
from
using
the
Extendable
Ears
The
only
new
bit
was
Crack
OUCH
Keep
your
voice
down
Ron
Mum
back
here
You
two
just
Apparated
knees
Yeah
well
harder
the
dark
Harry
saw
the
blurred
outlines
Fred
and
George
leaping
down
from
Ron
bed
There
was
groan
bedsprings
and
Harry
mattress
descended
few
inches
George
sat
down
near
his
feet
got
there
yet
said
George
eagerly
The
weapon
Sirius
mentioned
said
Harry
Let
slip
more
like
said
Fred
with
relish
now
sitting
next
Ron
didn
hear
aboutthat
the
old
Extendables
did
What
you
reckon
said
Harry
Could
anything
said
Fred
But
there
can
anything
worse
than
the
Avada
Kedavra
Curse
can
there
said
Ron
What
worse
than
death
Maybe
something
that
can
kill
loads
people
once
suggested
George
Maybe
some
particularly
painful
way
killing
people
said
Ron
fearfully
got
the
Cruciatus
Curse
for
causing
pain
said
Harry
doesn
need
anything
more
efficient
than
that
There
was
pause
and
Harry
knew
that
the
others
like
him
were
wondering
what
horrors
this
weapon
could
perpetrate
who
you
think
got
now
asked
George
hope
our
side
said
Ron
sounding
slightly
nervous
Dumbledore
probably
keeping
said
Fred
Where
said
Ron
quickly
Hogwarts
Bet
said
George
That
where
hid
the
Philosopher
Stone
weapons
going
lot
bigger
than
the
Stone
though
said
Ron
Not
necessarily
said
Fred
Yeah
size
guarantee
power
said
George
Look
Ginny
What
you
mean
said
Harry
You
never
been
the
receiving
end
one
her
Bat
Bogey
Hexes
have
you
Shhh
said
Fred
half
rising
irom
the
bed
Listen
They
fell
silent
Footsteps
were
coming
the
stairs
Mum
said
George
and
without
further
ado
there
was
loudcrack
and
Harry
felt
the
weight
vanish
from
the
end
his
bed
few
seconds
later
they
heard
the
floorboard
creak
outside
their
door
Mrs
Weasley
was
plainly
listening
check
whether
not
they
were
talking
Hedwig
and
Pigwidgeon
hooted
dolefully
The
floorboard
creaked
again
and
they
heard
her
heading
upstairs
check
Fred
and
George
She
doesn
trust
all
you
know
said
Ron
regretfully
Harry
was
sure
would
not
able
fall
asleep
the
evening
had
been
packed
with
things
think
about
that
fully
expected
lie
awake
for
hours
mulling
all
over
wanted
continue
talking
Ron
but
Mrs
Weasley
was
now
creaking
back
downstairs
again
and
once
she
had
gone
distinctly
heard
others
making
their
way
upstairs
fact
many
legged
creatures
were
cantering
softly
and
down
outside
the
bedroom
door
and
Hagrid
the
Care
Magical
Creatures
teacher
was
saying
Beauties
arm
they
Harry
studyin
weapons
this
term
and
Harry
saw
that
the
creatures
had
cannons
for
heads
and
were
wheeling
face
him
ducked
The
next
thing
knew
was
curled
into
warm
ball
under
his
bedclothes
and
George
loud
voice
was
filling
the
room
Mum
says
get
your
breakfast
the
kitchen
and
then
she
needs
you
the
drawing
room
there
are
loads
more
Doxys
than
she
thought
and
she
found
nest
dead
Puffskeins
under
the
sofa
Half
hour
later
Harry
and
Ron
who
had
dressed
and
breakfasted
quickly
entered
the
drawing
room
long
high
ceilinged
room
the
first
floor
with
olive
green
walls
covered
dirty
tapestries
The
carpet
exhaled
little
clouds
dust
every
time
someone
put
their
foot
and
the
long
moss
green
velvet
curtains
were
buzzing
though
swarming
with
invisible
bees
was
around
these
that
Mrs
Weasley
Hermione
Ginny
Fred
and
George
were
grouped
all
looking
rather
peculiar
they
had
each
tied
cloth
over
their
nose
and
mouth
Each
them
was
also
holding
large
bottle
black
liquid
with
nozzle
the
end
Cover
your
faces
and
take
spray
Mrs
Weasley
said
Harry
and
Ron
the
moment
she
saw
them
pointing
two
more
bottles
black
liquid
standing
spindle
legged
table
Doxycide
never
seen
infestation
this
bad
what
that
house
elf
been
doing
for
the
last
ten
years
Hermione
face
was
half
concealed
tea
towel
but
Harry
distinctly
saw
her
throw
reproachful
look
Mrs
Weasley
Kreacher
really
old
probably
couldn
manage
You
surprised
what
Kreacher
can
manage
when
wants
Hermione
said
Sirius
who
had
just
entered
the
room
carrying
bloodstained
bag
what
appeared
dead
rats
just
been
feeding
Buckbeak
added
reply
Harry
enquiring
look
keep
him
upstairs
inmy
mother
bedroom
Anyway
this
writing
desk
dropped
the
bag
rals
into
armchair
then
bent
over
examine
the
locked
cabinet
which
Harry
now
noticed
for
the
first
time
was
shaking
slightly
Well
Molly
pretty
sure
this
Boggart
said
Sirius
peering
through
the
keyhole
but
perhaps
ought
let
Mad
Eye
have
shifty
before
let
out
knowing
mother
could
something
much
worse
Right
you
are
Sirius
said
Mrs
Weasley
They
were
both
speaking
carefully
light
polite
voices
that
told
Harry
quite
plainly
that
neither
had
forgotten
their
disagreement
the
night
before
loud
clanging
bell
sounded
from
downstairs
followed
once
the
cacophony
screams
and
wails
that
had
been
triggered
the
previous
night
Tonks
knocking
over
the
umbrella
stand
keep
telling
them
not
ring
the
doorbell
said
Sirius
exasperatedly
hurrying
out
the
room
They
heard
him
thundering
down
the
stairs
Mrs
Black
screeches
echoed
through
the
house
once
more
Stains
dishonour
filthy
half
breeds
blood
traitors
children
filth
Close
the
door
please
Harry
said
Mrs
Weasley
Harry
took
much
time
dared
close
the
drawing
room
door
wanted
listen
what
was
going
downstairs
Sirius
had
obviously
managed
shut
the
curtains
over
his
mother
portrait
because
she
had
stopped
screaming
heard
Sirius
walking
down
the
hall
then
the
clattering
the
chain
the
front
door
and
then
deep
voice
recognised
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
saying
Hestia
just
relieved
she
got
Moody
Cloak
now
thought
leavea
report
for
Dumbledore
Feeling
Mrs
Weasley
eyes
the
back
his
head
Harry
regretfully
closed
the
drawing
room
door
and
rejoined
the
Doxy
party
Mrs
Weasley
was
bending
over
check
the
page
Doxys
inGilderoy
Lockhart
Guide
Household
Pests
which
was
lying
open
the
sofa
Right
you
lot
you
need
careful
because
Doxys
bite
and
their
teeth
are
poisonous
got
bottle
antidote
here
but
rather
nobody
needed
She
straightened
positioned
herself
squarely
front
the
curtains
and
beckoned
them
all
forward
When
say
the
word
start
spraying
immediately
she
said
They
come
flying
out
expect
but
says
the
sprays
one
good
squirt
will
paralyse
them
When
they
immobilised
just
throw
them
this
bucket
She
stepped
carefully
out
their
line
fire
and
raised
her
own
spray
All
right
squirt
Harry
had
been
spraying
only
few
seconds
when
fully
grown
Doxy
came
soaring
out
fold
the
material
shiny
beetle
like
wings
whirring
tiny
needle
sharp
teeth
bared
its
fairy
like
body
covered
with
thick
black
hair
and
its
four
tiny
lists
clenched
with
fury
Harry
caught
full
the
face
with
blast
Doxycide
froze
midair
and
fell
with
surprisingly
loudthunk
the
worn
carpet
below
Harry
picked
and
threw
the
bucket
Fred
what
are
you
doing
said
Mrs
Weasley
sharply
Spray
that
once
and
throw
away
Harry
looked
round
Fred
was
holding
struggling
Doxy
between
his
forefinger
and
thumb
Right
Fred
said
brightly
spraying
the
Doxy
quickly
the
face
that
fainted
but
the
moment
Mrs
Weasley
back
was
turned
pocketed
with
wink
want
experiment
with
Doxy
venom
for
our
Skiving
Snackboxes
George
told
Harry
under
his
breath
Deftly
spraying
two
Doxys
once
they
soared
straight
for
his
nose
Harry
moved
closer
George
and
muttered
out
the
corner
his
mouth
What
are
Skiving
Snackboxes
Range
sweets
make
you
ill
George
whispered
keeping
wary
eye
Mrs
Weasley
back
Not

ill

when

They

Moment

you
swallow
the
purple

which
restores
you
full
fitness
enabling
you

the
leisure
activity
your
own
choice
during

that
would
otherwise
have
been
devoted
unprofitable
boredom
That
what
putting
the
adverts
anyway
whispered
Fred
who
had
edged
over
out
Mrs
Weasley
line
vision
and
was
now
sweeping
few
stray
Doxys
from
the
floor
and
adding
them
his
pocket
But
they
still
need
bit
work
the
moment
our
testers
are
having
bit
trouble
stopping
themselves
puking

Testers

Fred

George
did
the
Fainting

George
Joke

still
then
Harry
muttered
pretending
adjusting
the
nozzle
his
spray
Well
haven
had
chance
get
premises
yet
said
Fred
dropping
his
voice
even
lower
Mrs
Weasley
mopped
her
brow
with
her
scarf
before
returning
the
attack
running
mail
order
service
the
moment
put
advertisements
theDaily
Prophet
last
week
All
thanks
you
mate
said
George
But
don
worry
Mum
hasn
got
clue
She
won
read
theDaily
Prophet
any
more
cause
telling
lies
about
you
and
Dumbledore
Harry
grinned
had
forced
the
Weasley
twins
take
the
thousand
Galleons
prize
money
had
won
the
Triwizard
Tournament
help
them
realize
their
ambition
open
joke
shop
but
was
still
glad
know
that
his
part
furthering
their
plans
was
unknown
Mrs
Weasley
She
did
not
think
running
joke
shop
was
suitable
career
for
two
her
sons
The
Doxying
the
curtains
took
most
the
morning
was
past
midday
when
Mrs
Weasley
finally
removed
her
protective
scarf
sank
into
sagging
armchair
and
sprang
again
with
cry
disgust
having
sat
the
bag
dead
rats
The
curtains
were
longer
buzzing
they
hung
limp
and
damp
from
the
intensive
spraying
the
foot
them
unconscious
Doxys
lay
crammed
the
bucket
beside
bowl
their
black
eggs
which
Crookshanks
was
now
sniffing
and
Fred
and
George
were
shooting
covetous
looks
think
tackle
those
after
lunch
Mrs
Weasley
pointed
the
dusty
glass
fronted
cabinets
standing
either
side
the
mantelpiece
They
were
crammed
with
odd
assortment
objects
selection
rusty
daggers
claws
coiled
snakeskin
number
tarnished
silver
boxes
inscribed
with
languages
Harry
could
not
understand
and
least
pleasant
all
ornate
crystal
bottle
with
large
opal
set
into
the
stopper
full
what
Harry
was
quite
sure
was
blood
The
clanging
doorbell
rang
again
Everyone
looked
Mrs
Weasley
Stay
here
she
said
firmly
snatching
the
bag
rats
Mrs
Black
screeches
started
again
from
down
below
bring
some
sandwiches
She
left
the
room
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
her
once
everyone
dashed
over
the
window
look
down
the
doorstep
They
could
see
the
top
unkempt
gingery
head
and
stack
precariously
balanced
cauldrons
Mundungus
said
Hermione
What
brought
all
those
cauldrons
for
Probably
looking
for
safe
place
keep
them
said
Harry
Isn
that
what
was
doing
the
night
was
supposed
tailing
Picking
dodgy
cauldrons
Yeah
you
right
said
Fred
the
front
door
opened
Mundungus
heaved
his
cauldrons
through
and
disappeared
from
view
Blimey
Mum
won
like
that
and
George
crossed
the
door
and
stood
beside
listening
closely
Mrs
Black
screaming
had
stopped
Mundungus
talking
Sirius
and
Kingsley
Fred
muttered
frowning
with
concentration
Can
hear
properly
you
reckon
can
risk
the
Extendable
Ears
Might
worth
said
George
could
sneak
upstairs
and
get
pair
But
that
precise
moment
there
was
explosion
sound
from
downstairs
that
rendered
Extendable
Ears
quite
unnecessary
All
them
could
hear
exactly
what
Mrs
Weasley
was
shouting
the
top
her
voice
ARE
NOT
RUNNING
HIDEOUT
FOR
STOLEN
GOODS
love
hearing
Mum
shouting
someone

said
Fred
with
satisfied
smile
his
face
opened
the
door

COMPLETELY

INTO
THE
HOUSE
The
idiots
are
letting
her
get
into
her
stride
said
George
shaking
his
head
You
got
head
her
off
early
otherwise
she
builds
head
steam
and
goes
for
hours
And
she
been
dying
have
Mundungus
ever
since
sneaked
off
when
was
supposed
following
you
Harry
and
there
goes
Sirius
mum
again
Mrs
Weasley
voice
was
lost
amid
fresh
shrieks
and
screams
from
the
portraits
the
hall
George
made
shut
the
door
drown
the
noise
but
before
could
house
elf
edged
into
the
room
Except
for
the
filthy
rag
tied
like
loincloth
around
its
middle
was
completely
naked
looked
very
old
Its
skin
seemed
several
times
too
big
for
and
though
was
bald
like
all
house
elves
there
was
quantity
white
hair
growing
out
its
large
batlike
ears
Its
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
watery
grey
and
its
fleshy
nose
was
large
and
rather
snoutlike
The
elf
took
absolutely
notice
Harry
and
the
rest
Acting
though
could
not
see
them
shuffled
hunchbacked
slowly
and
doggedly
towards
the
far
end
the
room
all
the
while
muttering
under
its
breath
hoarse
deep
voice
like
bullfrogs
smells
like
drain
and
criminal
boot
but
she
better
nasty
old
blood
traitor
with
her
brats
messing
mistress

poor
mistress
she
knew
she
knew
the
scum
they
let
into
her
house
what
would
she
say
old
Kreacher
the
shame
Mudbloods
and
werewolves
and
traitors
and
thieves
poor
old
Kreacher
what
can
Hello
Kreacher
said
Fred
very
loudly
closing
the
door
with
snap
The
house
elf
froze
his
tracks
stopped
muttering
and
gave
very
pronounced
and
very
unconvincing
start
surprise
Kreacher
did
not
see
young
master
said
turning
around
and
bowing
Fred
Still
facing
the
carpet
added
perfectly
audibly
Nasty
little
brat
blood
traitor
Sorry
said
George
Didn
catch
that
last
bit
Kreacher
said
nothing
said
the
elf
with
second
bow
George
adding
clear
undertone
and
there
its
twin
unnatural
little
beasts
they
are
Harry
didn
know
whether
laugh
not
The
elf
straightened
eyeing
them
all
malevolently
and
apparently
convinced
that
they
could
not
hear
him
continued
mutter
and
there
the
Mudblood
standing
there
bold
brass
mistress
knew
how
she
cry
and
there
new
boy
Kreacher
doesn
know
his
name
What

here
Kreacher
doesn

This
Harry
Kreacher
said
Herrmone
tentatively
Harry
Potter
Kreacher
pale
eyes
widened
and
muttered
faster
and
more
furiously
than
ever
The
Mudblood
talking
Kreacher
though
she
friend
Kreacher
mistress
saw
him
such
company
what

Ron
and
Ginny

very
angrily

Hermione
whispered

Hermione

said
Fred
eyeing
Kreacher
with
great
dislike
Kreacher
was
still
muttering
his
eyes
Harry
true
Harry
Potter
Kreacher

see
the
scar

that
the
boy
who
stopped
the
Dark
Lord

Kreacher
said
Fred
What

George
asked
Kreacher
huge
eyes
darted
towards
George
Kreacher
cleaning

evasively
likely
story
said
voice
behind
Harry
Sirius
had
come
back
was
glowering
the
elf
from
the
doorway
The
noise
the
hall
had
abated
perhaps
Mrs
Weasley
and
Mundungus
had
moved
their
argument
down
into
the
kitchen
the
sight
Sirius
Kreacher
flung
himself
into
ridiculously
low
bow
that
flattened
his
snoutltke
nose
the
floor
Stand
straight
said
Sirius
impatiently
Now
what
are
you
Kreacher
cleaning
the
elf
repeated
Kreacher
lives

the
Noble
House
Black
And
getting
blacker
every
day
filthy
said
Sirius
Master
always
liked
his
little
joke
said
Kreacher
bowing
again
and
continuing
undertone
Master
was
nasty
ungrateful
swine
who
broke
his
mother
heart
mother
didn
have
heart
Kreacher
snapped
Sirius
She
kept
herself
alive
out
pure
spite
Kreacher
bowed
again
spoke
Whatever
Master
says
muttered
furiously
Master
not
fit
wipe
slime
from
his
mother
boots
poor
mistress
what
would
she
say
she
saw
Kreacher
serving
him
how
she
hated
him
what
disappointment
was
asked
you
what
you
were
said
Sirius
coldly
Every
time
you
show
pretending
cleaning
you
sneak
something
off
your
room
can
throw
out
Kreacher
would
never
move
anything
from
its
proper
place
Master
house
said
the
elf
then
muttered
very
fast
Mistress
would
never
forgive
Kreacher
the
tapestry
was
thrown
out
seven
centuries
been
the
family
Kreacher
must
save
Kreacher
will
not
let
Master
and
the
blood
traitors
and
the
brats
destroy
thought
might
that
said
Sirius
casting
disdainful
look
the
opposite
wall
She
have
put
another
Permanent
Sticking
Charm
the
back
don
doubt
but
can
get
rid
certainly
will
Now
away
Kreacher
seemed
that
Kreacher
did
not
dare
disobey
direct
order
nevertheless
the
look
gave
Sirius
shuffled
out
past
him
was
full
deepest
loathing
and
muttered
all
the
way
out
the
room
comes
back
from
Azkaban
ordering
Kreacher
around
mypoor
mistress
what
would
she
say
she
saw
the
house
now
scum
living
her
treasures
thrown
out
she
swore
was
son
hers
and
back
they
say
murderer
too
Keep
muttering
and
will
murderer
said
Sirius
irritably
slammed
the
door
shut
the
elf
Sirius
not
right
the
head
Hermione
pleaded
don
think
realises
can
hear
him
been
alone
too
long
said
Sirius
taking
mad
orders
from
mother
portrait
and
talking
himself
but
was
always
foul
little
you
could
just
set
him
free
said
Hermione
hopefully
maybe
can
set
him
free
knows
too
much
about
the
Order
said
Sirius
curtly
And
anyway
the
shock
would
kill
him
You
suggest
him
that
leaves
this
house
see
how
takes
Sirius
walked
across
the
room
where
the
tapestry
Kreacher
had
been
trying
protect
hung
the
length
the
wall
Harry
and
the
others
followed
The
tapestry
looked
immensely
old
was
faded
and
looked
though
Doxys
had
gnawed
places
Nevertheless
the
golden
thread
with
which
was
embroidered
still
glinted
brightly
enough
show
them
sprawling
family
tree
dating
back
far
Harry
could
tell
the
Middle
Ages
Large
words
the
very
top
the
tapestry
read
The
Noble
and
Most
Ancient
House
Black
Toujours
Pur
You
not
here
said
Harry
after
scanning
the
bottom
the
tree
closely
used
there
said
Sirius
pointing
small
round
charred
hole
the
tapestry
rather
like
cigarette
burn
sweet
old
mother
blasted
off
after
ran
away
from
home
Kreacher
quite
fond
muttering
the
story
under
his
breath
You
ran
away
from
home
When
was
about
sixteen
said
Sirius
had
enough
Where
did
you
asked
Harry
staring
him
Your
dad
place
said
Sirius
Your
grandparents
were
really
good
about
they
sort
adopted
second
son
Yeah
camped
out
your
dad
the
school
holidays
and
when
was
seventeen
got
place
own
Uncle
Alphard
had
left
decent
bit
gold
been
wiped
off
here
too
that
probably
why
anyway
after
that
looked
after
myself
was
always
welcome
and
Mrs
Potter
for
Sunday
lunch
though
But
why
did
you
Leave
Sirius
smiled
bitterly
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
long
unkempt
hair
Because
hated
the
whole
lot
them
parents
with
their
pure
blood
mania
convinced
that
Black
made
you
practically
royal
idiot
brother
soft
enough
believe
them
that
him
Sirius
jabbed
finger
the
very
bottom
the
tree
the
name
Regulus
Black
date
death
some
fifteen
years
previously
followed
the
date
birth
was
younger
than
said
Sirius
and
much
better
son
was
constantly
reminded
But
died
said
Harry
Yeah
said
Sirius
Stupid
idiot
joined
the
Death
Eaters
You
kidding
Come
Harry
haven
you
seen
enough
this
house
tell
what
kind
wizards
family
were
said
Sirius
testily
Were
were
your
parents
Death
Eaters
well
but
believe
they
thought
Voldemort
had
the
right
idea
they
were
all
for
the
purification
the
wizarding
race
getting
rid
Muggle
borns
and
having
pure
bloods
charge
They
weren
alone
either
there
were
quite
few
people
before
Voldemort
showed
his
true
colours
who
thought
had
the
right
idea
about
things
they
got
cold
feet
when
they
saw
what
was
prepared
get
power
though
But
bet
parents
thought
Regulus
was
right
little
hero
for
joining
first
Was
killed
Auror
Harry
asked
tentatively
said
Sirius
was
murdered
Voldemort
Voldemort
orders
more
likely
doubt
Regulus
was
ever
important
enough
killed
Voldemort
person
From
what
found
out
after
died
got
far
then
panicked
about
what
was
being
asked
and
tried
back
out
Well
you
don
just
hand
your
resignation
Voldemort
lifetime
service
death
Lunch
said
Mrs
Weasley
voice
She
was
holding
her
wand
high
front
her
balancing
huge
tray
loaded
with
sandwiches
and
cake
its
tip
She
was
very
red
the
face
and
still
looked
angry
The
others
moved
over
her
eager
for
some
food
but
Harry
remained
with
Sirius
who
had
bent
closer
the
tapestry
haven
looked
this
for
years
There
Phineas
Nigellus
great
great
grandfather
see
least
popular
Headmaster
Hogwarts
ever
had
and
Araminta
Mehflua
cousin
mothers
tried
force
through
Ministry
Bill
make
Muggle
hunting
legal
and
dear
Aunt
Elladora
she
started
the
family
tradition
beheading
house
elves
when
they
got
too
old
carry
tea
trays
course
any
time
the
family
produced
someone
halfway
decent
they
were
disowned
see
Tonks
isn
here
Maybe
that
why
Kreacher
won
take
orders
from
her
supposed
whatever
anyone
the
family
asks
him
You
and
Tonks
are
related
Harry
asked
surprised
yeah
her
mother
Andromeda
was
favourite
cousin
said
Sirius
examining
the
tapestry
closely
Andromeda
not
here
either
look
pointed
another
small
round
burn
mark
between
two
names
Bellatrix
and
Narcissa
Andromeda
sisters
are
still
here
because
they
made
lovely
respectable
pure
blood
marriages
but
Andromeda
married
Muggle
born
Ted
Tonks
Sirius
mimed
blasting
the
tapestry
with
wand
and
laughed
sourly
Harry
however
did
not
laugh
was
too
busy
staring
the
names
the
right
Andromeda
burn
mark
double
line
gold
embroidery
linked
Narcissa
Black
with
Lucius
Malfoy
and
single
vertical
gold
line
from
their
names
led
the
name
Draco
You
related
the
Malfoys
The
pure
blood
families
are
all
interrelated
said
Sirius
you
only
going
let
your
sons
and
daughters
marry
pure
bloods
your
choice
very
limited
there
are
hardly
any
left
Molly
and
are
cousins
marriage
and
Arthur
something
like
second
cousin
once
removed
But
there
point
looking
for
them
here
ever
family
was
bunch
blood
traitors
the
Weasleys
But
Harry
was
now
looking
the
name
the
left
Andromeda
burn
Bellatrix
Black
which
was
connected
double
line
Rodolphus
Lestrange
Lestrange
Harry
said
aloud
The
name
had
stirred
something
his
memory
knew
from
somewhere
but
for
moment
couldn
think
where
though
gave
him
odd
creeping
sensation
the
pit
his
stomach
They
Azkaban
said
Sirius
shortly
Harry
looked
him
curiously
Bellatrix
and
her
husband
Rodolphus
came
with
Barty
Crouch
junior
said
Sirius
the
same
brusque
voice
Rodolphuss
brother
Rabastan
was
with
them
too
Then
Harry
remembered
had
seen
Bellatrix
Lestrange
inside
Dumbledore
Pensieve
the
strange
device
which
thoughts
and
memories
could
stored
tall
dark
woman
with
heavy
lidded
eyes
who
had
stood
her
trial
and
proclaimed
her
continuing
allegiance
Lord
Voldemort
her
pride
that
she
had
tried
find
him
after
his
downfall
and
her
conviction
that
she
would
one
day
rewarded
for
her
loyalty
You
never
said
she
was
your
Does
matter
she
cousin
snapped
Sirius
far
concerned
they
not
family
She
certainly
not
family
haven
seen
her
since
was
your
age
unless
you
count
glimpse
her
coming
into
Azkaban
you
think
proud
having
relative
like
her
Sorry
said
Harry
quickly
didn
mean
was
just
surprised
that
all
doesn
matter
don
apologise
Sirius
mumbled
turned
away
from
the
tapestry
his
hands
deep
his
pockets
don
like
being
back
here
said
staring
across
the
drawing
room
never
thought
stuck
this
house
again
Harry
understood
completely
knew
how
would
feel
when
was
grown
and
thought
was
free
the
place
for
ever
return
and
live
number
four
Privet
Drive

for
Headquarters
course
Sirius
said
father
put
every
security
measure
known
wizardkind
when
lived
here
unplottable
Muggles
could
never
come
and
call
they
ever
have
wanted
and
now
Dumbledore
added
his
protection
you
hard
put
find
safer
house
anywhere
Dumbledore
Secret
Keeper
for
the
Order
you
know
nobody
can
find
Headquarters
unless
tells
them
personally
where
that
note
Moody
showed
you
last
night
that
was
from
Dumbledore
Sirius
gave
short
bark
like
laugh
parents
couldsee
the
use
their
house
was
being
put
now
well
mother
portrait
should
give
you
some
idea
scowled
for
moment
then
sighed
wouldn
mind
could
just
get
out
occasionally
and
something
useful
asked
Dumbledore
whether
can
escort
you
your
hearing
Snuffles
obviously
can
give
you
bit
moral
support
what
you
think
Harry
felt
though
his
stomach
had
sunk
through
the
dusty
carpet
had
not
thought
about
the
hearing
once
since
dinner
the
previous
evening
the
excitement
being
back
with
the
people
liked
best
and
hearing
everything
that
was
going
had
completely
flown
his
mind
Sirius
words
however
the
crushing
sense
dread
returned
him
stared
Hermione
and
the
Weasleys
all
tucking
into
their
sandwiches
and
thought
how
would
feel
they
went
back
Hogwarts
without
him
Don
worry
Sirius
said
Harry
looked
and
realised
that
Sirius
had
been
watching
him
sure
they
clear
you
there
definitely
something
the
International
Statute
Secrecy
about
being
allowed
use
magic
save
your
own
life
But
they
expel
said
Harry
quietly
can
come
back
here
and
live
with
you
Sirius
smiled
sadly
see
feel
lot
better
about
the
hearing
knew
didn
have
back
the
Dursleys
Harry
pressed
him
They
must
bad
you
prefer
this
place
said
Sirius
gloomily
Hurry
you
two
there
won
any
food
left
Mrs
Weasley
called
Sirius
heaved
another
great
sigh
cast
dark
look
the
tapestry
then
and
Harry
went
join
the
others
Harry
tried
his
best
not
think
about
the
hearing
while
they
emptied
the
glass
fronted
cabinets
that
afternoon
Fortunately
for
him
was
job
that
required
lot
concentration
many
the
objects
there
seemed
very
reluctant
leave
their
dusty
shelves
Sirius
sustained
bad
bite
from
silver
snuffbox
within
seconds
his
bitten
hand
had
developed
unpleasant
crusty
covering
like
tough
brown
glove
Its
said
examining
the
hand
with
interest
before
tapping
lightly
with
his
wand
and
restoring
its
skin
normal
must
Wartcap
powder
there
threw
the
box
aside
into
the
sack
where
they
were
depositing
the
debris
from
the
cabinets
Harry
saw
George
wrap
his
own
hand
carefully
cloth
moments
later
and
sneak
the
box
into
his
already
Doxy
filled
pocket
They
found
unpleasant
looking
silver
instrument
something
like
many
legged
pair
tweezers
which
scuttled
Harry
arm
like
spider
when
picked
and
attempted
puncture
his
skin
Sirius
seized
and
smashed
with
heavy
book
entitledNature
Nobility
Wizarding
Genealogy
There
was
musical
box
that
emitted
faintly
sinister
tinkling
tune
when
wound
and
they
all
found
themselves
becoming
curiously
weak
and
sleepy
until
Ginny
had
the
sense
slam
the
lid
shut
heavy
locket
that
none
them
could
open
number
ancient
seals
and
dusty
box
Order
Merlin
First
Class
that
had
been
awarded
Sirius
grandfather
for
services
the
Ministry
means
gave
them
load
gold
said
Sirius
contemptuously
throwing
the
medal
into
the
rubbish
sack
Several
times
Kreacher
sidled
into
the
room
and
attempted
smuggle
things
away
under
his
loincloth
muttering
horrible
curses
every
time
they
caught
him
When
Sirius
wrested
large
golden
ring
bearing
the
Black
crest
from
his
grip
Kreacher
actually
burst
into
furious
tears
and
left
the
room
sobbing
under
his
breath
and
calling
Sirius
names
Harry
had
never
heard
before
was
father
said
Sirius
throwing
the
ring
into
the
sack
Kreacher
wasn
tquite
devoted
him
mother
but
still
caught
him
snogging
pair
father
old
trousers
last
week
Weasley
kept
them
all
working
very
hard
over
the
next
few
days
The
drawing
room
took
three
days
decontaminate
Finally
the
only
undesirable
things
left
were
the
tapestry
the
Black
family
tree
which
resisted
all
their
attempts
remove
from
the
wall
and
the
rattling
writing
desk
Moody
had
not
dropped
Headquarters
yet
they
could
not
sure
what
was
inside
They
moved
from
the
drawing
room
dining
room
the
ground
floor
where
they
found
spiders
large
saucers
lurking
the
dresser
Ron
left
the
room
hurriedly
make
cup
tea
and
did
not
return
for
hour
and
half
The
china
which
bore
the
Black
crest
and
motto
was
all
thrown
unceremoniously
into
sack
Sirius
and
the
same
fate
met
set
old
photographs
tarnished
silver
frames
all
whose
occupants
squealed
shrilly
the
glass
covering
them
smashed
Snape
might
refer
their
work
cleaning
but
Harry
opinion
they
were
really
waging
war
the
house
which
was
putting
very
good
fight
aided
and
abetted
Kreacher
The
house
elf
kept
appearing
wherever
they
were
congregated
his
muttering
becoming
more
and
more
offensive
attempted
remove
anything
hecould
from
the
rubbish
sacks
Sirius
went
far
threaten
him
with
clothes
but
Kreacher
fixed
him
with
watery
stare
and
said
Master
must
Master
wishes
before
turning
away
and
muttering
very
loudly
but
Master
will
not
turn
Kreacher
away
because
Kreacher
knows
what
they
are
yes
plotting
against
the
Dark
Lord
yes
with
these
Mudbloods
and
traitors
and
scum
which
Sirius
ignoring
Hermione
protests
seized
Kreacher
the
back
his
loincloth
and
threw
him
bodily
from
the
room
The
doorbell
rang
several
times
day
which
was
the
cue
for
Sirius
mother
start
shrieking
again
and
for
Harry
and
the
others
attempt
eavesdrop
the
visitor
though
they
gleaned
very
little
from
the
brief
glimpses
and
snatches
conversation
they
were
able
sneak
before
Mrs
Weasley
recalled
them
their
tasks
Snape
flitted
and
out
the
house
several
times
more
though
Harry
relief
they
never
came
face
face
Harry
also
caught
sight
his
Transfiguration
teacher
Professor
McGonagall
looking
very
odd
Muggle
dress
and
coat
and
she
also
seemed
too
busy
linger
Sometimes
however
the
visitors
stayed
help
Tonks
joined
them
for
memorable
afternoon
which
they
found
murderous
old
ghoul
lurking
upstairs
toilet
and
Lupin
who
was
staying
the
house
with
Sirius
but
who
left
for
long
periods
mysterious
work
for
the
Order
helped
them
repair
grandfather
clock
that
had
developed
the
unpleasant
habit
shooting
heavy
bolts
passers
Mundungus
redeemed
himself
slightly
Mrs
Weasley
eyes
rescuing
Ron
from
ancient
set
purple
robes
that
had
tried
strangle
him
when
removed
them
from
their
wardrobe
Despite
the
fact
that
was
still
sleeping
badly
still
having
dreams
about
corridors
and
locked
doors
that
made
his
scar
prickle
Harry
was
managing
have
fun
for
the
first
time
all
summer
long
was
busy
was
happy
when
the
action
abated
however
whenever
dropped
his
guard
lay
exhausted
bed
watching
blurred
shadows
move
across
the
ceiling
the
thought
the
looming
Ministry
hearing
returned
him
Fear
jabbed
his
insides
like
needles
wondered
what
was
going
happen
him
was
expelled
The
idea
was
terrible
that
did
not
dare
voice
aloud
not
even
Ron
and
Hermione
who
though
often
saw
them
whispering
together
and
casting
anxious
looks
his
direction
followed
his
lead
not
mentioning
Sometimes
could
not
prevent
his
imagination
showing
him
faceless
Ministry
official
who
was
snapping
his
wand
two
and
ordering
him
back
the
Dursleys
but
would
not
was
determined
that
would
come
back
here
Grimmauld
Place
and
live
with
Sirius
felt
though
brick
had
dropped
into
his
stomach
when
Mrs
Weasley
turned
him
during
dinner
Wednesday
evening
and
said
quietly
ironed
your
best
clothes
for
tomorrow
morning
Harry
and
want
you
wash
your
hair
tonight
too
good
first
impression
can
work
wonders
Ron
Hermione
Fred
George
and
Ginny
all
stopped
talking
and
looked
over
him
Harry
nodded
and
tried
keep
eating
his
chop
but
his
mouth
had
become
dry
could
not
chew
How
getting
there
asked
Mrs
Weasley
trying
sound
unconcerned
Arthur
taking
you
work
with
him
said
Mrs
Weasley
gently
Weasley
smiled
encouragingly
Harry
across
the
table
You
can
wait
office
until
time
for
the
hearing
said
Harry
looked
over
Sirius
but
before
could
ask
the
question
Mrs
Weasley
had
answered
Professor
Dumbledore
doesn
think
good
idea
for
Sirius
with
you
and
must
say
think
squite
right
said
Sirius
through
clenched
teeth
Mrs
Weasley
pursed
her
lips
When
did
Dumbledore
tell
you
that
Harry
said
staring
Sirius
came
last
night
when
you
were
bed
said
Weasley
Sirius
stabbed
moodily
potato
with
his
fork
Harry
lowered
his
own
eyes
his
plate
The
thought
that
Dumbledore
had
been
the
house
the
eve
his
hearing
and
not
asked
see
him
made
him
feel
were
possible
even
worse
THE
MINISTRY
MAGIC
Harry
awoke
half
past
five
the
next
morning
abruptly
and
completely
somebody
had
yelled
his
ear
For
few
moments
lay
immobile
the
prospect
the
disciplinary
hearing
filled
every
tiny
particle
his
brain
then
unable
bear
leapt
out
bed
and
put
his
glasses
Mrs
Weasley
had
laid
out
his
freshly
laundered
jeans
and
shirt
the
foot
his
bed
Harry
scrambled
into
them
The
blank
picture
the
wall
sniggered
Ron
was
lying
sprawled
his
back
with
his
mouth
wide
open
fast
asleep
did
not
stir
Harry
crossed
the
room
stepped
out
the
landing
and
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
Trying
not
think
the
next
time
would
see
Ron
when
they
might
longer
fellow
students
Hogwarts
Harry
walked
quietly
down
the
stairs
past
the
heads
Kreacher
ancestors
and
down
into
the
kitchen
had
expected
empty
but
when
reached
the
door
heard
the
soft
rumble
voices
the
other
side
pushed
open
and
saw
and
Mrs
Weasley
Sirius
Lupin
and
Tonks
sitting
there
almost
though
they
were
waiting
for
him
All
were
fully
dressed
except
Mrs
Weasley
who
was
wearing
quilted
purple
dressing
gown
She
leapt
her
feet
the
moment
Harry
entered
Breakfast
she
said
she
pulled
out
her
wand
and
hurried
over
the
fire
morning
Harry
yawned
Tonks
Her
hair
was
blonde
and
curly
this
morning
Sleep
all
right
Yeah
said
Harry
been
all
night
she
said
with
another
shuddering
yawn
Come
and
sit
down
She
drew
out
chair
knocking
over
the
one
beside
the
process
What
you
want
Harry
Mrs
Weasley
called
Porridge
Muffins
Kippers
Bacon
and
eggs
Toast
Just
just
toast
thanks
said
Harry
Lupin
glanced
Harry
then
said
Tonks
What
were
you
saying
about
Scrimgeour
yeah
well
need
bit
more
careful
been
asking
Kingsley
and
funny
questions
Harry
felt
vaguely
grateful
that
was
not
required
join
the
conversation
His
insides
were
squirming
Mrs
Weasley
placed
couple
pieces
toast
and
marmalade
front
him
tried
eat
but
was
like
chewing
carpet
Mrs
Weasley
sat
down
his
other
side
and
started
fussing
with
his
shirt
tucking
the
label
and
smoothing
out
the
creases
across
his
shoulders
wished
she
wouldn
and
have
tell
Dumbledore
can
night
duty
tomorrow
just
too
tired
Tonks
finished
yawning
hugely
again
cover
for
you
said
Weasley
got
report
finish
anyway
Weasley
was
not
wearing
wizards
robes
but
pair
pinstriped
trousers
and
old
bomber
jacket
turned
from
Tonks
Harry
How
are
you
feeling
Harry
shrugged
all
over
soon
Weasley
said
bracingly
few
hours
time
you
cleared
Harry
said
nothing
The
hearing
floor
Amelia
Bones
office
She
Head
the
Department
Magical
Law
Enforcement
and
the
one
who
questioning
you
Amelia
Bones
Harry
said
Tonks
earnestly
She
fair
she
hear
you
out
Harry
nodded
still
unable
think
anything
say
Don
lose
your
temper
said
Sirius
abruptly
polite
and
stick
the
facts
Harry
nodded
again
The
law
your
side
said
Lupin
quietly
Even
underage
wizards
are
allowed
use
magic
life
threatening
situations
Something
very
cold
trickled
down
the
back
Harry
neck
for
moment
thought
someone
was
putting
Disillusionment
Charm
him
then
realised
that
Mrs
Weasley
was
attacking
his
hair
with
wet
comb
She
pressed
hard
the
top
his
head
Doesn
ever
lie
flat
she
said
desperately
Harry
shook
his
head
Weasley
checked
his
watch
and
looked
Harry
think
now
said
bit
early
but
think
you
better
off
the
Ministry
than
hanging
around
here
said
Harry
automatically
dropping
his
toast
and
getting
his
feet
You
all
right
Harry
said
Tonks
patting
him
the
arm
Good
luck
said
Lupin
sure
will
fine
And
not
said
Sirius
grimly
see
Amelia
Bones
for
you
Harry
smiled
weakly
Mrs
Weasley
hugged
him
all
got
our
fingers
crossed
she
said
Right
said
Harry
Well
see
you
later
then
followed
Weasley
upstairs
and
along
the
hall
could
hear
Sirius
mother
grunting
her
sleep
behind
her
curtains
Weasley
unbolted
the
door
and
they
stepped
out
into
the
cold
grey
dawn
You
don
normally
walk
work
you
Harry
asked
him
they
set
off
briskly
around
the
square
usually
Apparate
said
Weasley
but
obviously
you
can
and
think
best
arrive
thoroughly
non
magical
fashion
makes
better
impression
given
what
you

for
Weasley
kept
his
hand
inside
his
jacket
they
walked
Harry
knew
was
clenched
around
his
wand
The
run
down
streets
were
almost
deserted
but
when
they
arrived
the
miserable
little
underground
station
they
found
already
full
early
morning
commuters
ever
when
found
himself
close
proximity
Muggles
going
about
their
daily
business
Weasley
was
hard
put
contain
his
enthusiasm
Simply
fabulous
whispered
indicating
the
automatic
ticket
machines
Wonderfully
ingenious
They
out
order
said
Harry
pointing
the
sign
Yes
but
even
said
Weasley
beaming
them
fondly
They
bought
their
tickets
instead
from
sleepy
looking
guard
Harry
handled
the
transaction
Weasley
was
not
very
good
with
Muggle
money
and
five
minutes
later
they
were
boarding
underground
train
that
rattled
them
off
towards
the
centre
London
Weasley
kept
anxiously
checking
and
checking
the
Underground
Map
above
the
windows
Four
more
stops
Harry
Three
stops
left
now
Two
stops
Harry
They
got
off
station
the
very
heart
London
and
were
swept
from
the
train
tide
besuited
men
and
women
carrying
briefcases
the
escalator
they
went
through
the
ticket
barrier
Weasley
delighted
with
the
way
the
stile
swallowed
his
ticket
and
emerged
broad
street
lined
with
imposing
looking
buildings
and
already
full
traffic
Where
are
said
Weasley
blankly
and
for
one
heart
stopping
moment
Harry
thought
they
had
got
off
the
wrong
station
despite
Weasley
continual
references
the
map
but
second
later
said
yes
this
way
Harry
and
led
him
down
side
road
Sorry
said
but
never
come
train
and
all
looks
rather
different
from
Muggle
perspective
matter
fact
never
even
used
the
visitors
entrance
before
The
further
they
walked
the
smaller
and
less
imposing
the
buildings
became
until
finally
they
reached
street
that
contained
several
rather
shabby
looking
offices
pub
and
overflowing
skip
Harry
had
expected
rather
more
impressive
location
for
the
Ministry
Magic
Here
are
said
Weasley
brightly
pointing
old
red
telephone
box
which
was
missing
several
panes
glass
and
stood
before
heavily
graffitied
wall
After
you
Harry
opened
the
telephone
box

Harry
stepped
inside
wondering
what
earth
this
was
about
Weasley
folded
himself
beside
Harry
and
closed
the
door
was
tight
fit
Harry
was
jammed
against
the
telephone
apparatus
which
was
hanging
crookedly
from
the
wall
though
vandal
had
tried
rip
off
Weasley
reached
past
Harry
for
the

Weasley

this
might

Harry

the

sounded
inside
the
telephone
box
not
from

Weasley

but
loudly
and
plainly
though
invisible

were
standing
right
beside
them

clearly

the

The
floor
the
telephone

shuddered
They
were
sinking
slowly
into
the
ground
Harry
watched
apprehensively
the
pavement
seemed
rise
past
the
glass
windows
the
telephone
box
until
darkness
closed
over
their
heads
Then
could
see
nothing
all
could
hear
only
dull
grinding
noise
the
telephone
box
made
its
way
down
through
the
earth
After
about

though

much
longer
Harry
chink
golden
light
illuminated
his

and
widening
rose
his
body
until
hit
him
the

had

The

said
the
woman
voice
The
door
the
telephone
box
sprang
open
and
Weasley
stepped
out
followed
Harry
whose
mouth
had
fallen
open
They
were
standing
one
end
very
long
and
splendid
hall
with
highly
polished
dark

floor
The
peacock
blue
ceiling
was
inlaid
with
gleaming
golden
symbols
that
kept
moving
and
changing
like
some
enormous
heavenly
noticeboard
The
walls
each
side
were
panelled

had
many
gilded

Every

Harry
followed

through

into
the
smaller

beyond
where

twenty

stood
behind

Harry

Weasley
joined
the

around

Nearby

Harry

and
jabbed
impatiently
the
down
button
Come
The
lift
clattered
into
view
and
they
hurried
inside
Every
time
stopped
Weasley
cursed
furiously
and
pummelled
the
number
nine
button
Those
courtrooms
haven
been
used
years
said
Weasley
angrily
can
think
why
they
doing
down
there
unless
but
plump
witch
carrying
smoking
goblet
entered
the
lift
that
moment
and
Weasley
did
not
elaborate
The
Atrium
said
the
cool
female
voice
and
the
golden
grilles
slid
open
showing
Harry
distant
glimpse
the
golden
statues
the
fountain
The
plump
witch
got
out
and
sallow
skinned
wizard
with
very
mournful
face
got
Morning
Arthur
said
sepulchral
voice
the
lift
began
descend
Don
often
see
you
down
here
Urgent
business
Bode
said
Weasley
who
was
bouncing
the
balls
his
feet
and
throwing
anxious
looks
over
Harry
yes
said
Bode
surveying
Harry
unblinkingly
course
Harry
barely
had
emotion
spare
for
Bode
but
his
unfaltering
gaze
did
not
make
him
feel
any
more
comfortable
Department
Mysteries
said
the
cool
female
voice
and
left
that
Quick
Harry
said
Weasley
the
lift
doors
rattled
open
and
they
sped
corridor
that
was
quite
different
from
those
above
The
walls
were
bare
there
were
windows
and
doors
apart
from
plain
black
one
set
the
very
end
the
corridor
Harry
expected
them
through
but
instead
Weasley
seized
him
the
arm
and
dragged
him
the
left
where
there
was
opening
leading
flight
steps
Down
here
down
here
panted
Weasley
taking
two
steps
time
The
lift
doesn
even
come
down
this
far
why
they
doing
down
there
They
reached
the
bottom
the
steps
and
ran
along
yet
another
corridor
which
bore
great
resemblance
the
one
that
led
Snape
dungeon
Hogwarts
with
rough
stone
walls
and
torches
brackets
The
doors
they
passed
here
were
heavy
wooden
ones
with
iron
bolts
and
keyholes
Courtroom
Ten
think
nearly
yes
Weasley
stumbled
halt
outside
grimy
dark
door
with
immense
iron
lock
and
slumped
against
the
wall
clutching
stitch
his
chest
panted
pointing
his
thumb
the
door
Get
there
Aren
aren

coming
with
not

Good

Harry
heart
was
beating
violent
tattoo
against
his
Adam
apple
swallowed
hard
turned
the
heavy
iron
door
handle
and
stepped
inside
the
courtroom
THE
HEARING
Harry
gasped
could
not
help
himself
The
large
dungeon
had
entered
was
horribly
familiar
had
not
only
seen
before
hadbeen
here
before
This
was
the
place
had
visited
inside
Dumbledore
Pensieve
the
place
where
had
watched
the
Lestranges
sentenced
life
imprisonment
Azkaban
The
walls
were
made
dark
stone
dimly
lit
torches
Empty
benches
rose
either
side
him
but
ahead
the
highest
benches
all
were
many
shadowy
figures
They
had
been
talking
low
voices
but
the
heavy
door
swung
closed
behind
Harry
ominous
silence
fell
cold
male
voice
rang
across
the
courtroom
You
late
Sorry
said
Harry
nervously
didn
know
the
time
had
been
changed
That
not
the
Wizengamot
fault
said
the
voice
owl
was
sent
you
this
morning
Take
your
seat
Harry
dropped
his
gaze
the
chair
the
centre
the
room
the
arms
which
were
covered
chains
had
seen
those
chains
spring
life
and
bind
whoever
sat
between
them
His
footsteps
echoed
loudly
walked
across
the
stone
floor
When
sat
gingerly
the
edge
the
chair
the
chains
clinked
threateningly
but
did
not
bind
him
Feeling
rather
sick
looked
the
people
seated
the
bench
above
There
were
about
fifty
them
all
far
could
see
wearing
plum
coloured
robes
with
elaborately
worked
silver
the
left
hand
side
the
chest
and
all
staring
down
their
noses
him
some
with
very
austere
expressions
others
looks
frank
curiosity
the
very
middle
the
front
row
sat
Cornelius

witch
with
very
short
grey
hair
sat
Fudge

she
wore
monocle
and
looked
forbidding
Fudge
right
was
another
witch
but
she
was
sitting
far
back
the
bench
that
her
face
was
shadow
Very
well
said
Fudge
The
accused

present
finally
let
begin
Are

the

Yes

said
eager
voice
Harry
knew
Ron

Percy
was
sitting
the

Harry
looked
Percy
expecting
some
sign
recognition
from
him
but
none
came
Percy

Dumbledore
was
striding
serenely
across
the
room
wearing
long
midnight
blue
robes
and
perfectly
calm
expression
His
long
silver
beard
and

gleamed
the

drew
level
with
Harry
and
looked
Fudge
through
the
half
moon
spectacles
that
rested
halfway
down
his
very
crooked
nose
The
members

were
muttering
All

Dumbledore
pleasantly

and

next
Harry
Dumbledore
sat
down
put
the
tips
his
long
fingers
together
and
surveyed
Fudge
over
them
with
expression
polite
interest
The
Wizengamot
was
still
muttering
and
fidgeting
restlessly
only
when
Fudge
spoke

did
they
settle
down

his

Well

Madam

true
Patronus

very
impressive
indeed
Some
the
wizards
and
witches
around
her
were
muttering
again
few
nodded
but
others
were
frowning
and
shaking
their
heads
not
question
how
impressive
the
magic
was
said
Fudge
testy
voice
fact
the
more
impressive
the
worse
would
have

that
the

Those
who
had
been
frowning
now
murmured
agreement
but
was
the
sight
Percy
sanctimonious
little
nod
that
goaded
Harry
into
speech
did
because
the
Dementors
said
loudly
before
anyone
could
interrupt
him
again
had
expected
more
muttering
but
the
silence
that
fell
seemed
somehow
denser
than
before
Dementors
said
Madam
Bones
after
moment
her
thick
eyebrows
rising
until
her
monocle
looked
danger
falling
out
What
you
mean
boy
mean
there
were
two
Dementors
down
that
alleyway
and
they
went
for

Fudge
again
smirking
unpleasantly

around

Highly

said
Harry
loudly
over
another
outbreak
muttering
from
the
court
There
were
two
them
coming
from
opposite
ends
the
alley
everything
went
dark
and
cold
and
cousin
felt
them
and
ran
for
Enough

Fudge
with
very
supercilious
look
his

pulling

back
together

Dumbledore
pleasantly
but
sure
that

Madam

continued
addressing
the

True

Madam

Perfectly

Fudge
Where
this

Dumbledore
She

outside

door
Should

Fudge
barked
Percy
who
got
once
ran
down
the
stone
steps
from
the
judge
balcony
and
hurried
past
Dumbledore
and
Harry
without
glancing
them
moment
later
Percy
returned
followed
Mrs
Figg
She
looked
scared
and
more
batty
than
ever
Harry
wished
she
had
thought
change
out
her
carpet
slippers
Dumbledore
stood
and
gave
Mrs
Figg
his
chair
conjuring
second
one
for
himself
Full
name
said
Fudge
loudly
when
Mrs
Figg
had
perched
herself
nervously
the
very
edge
her
seal
Arabella
Doreen
Figg
said
Mrs
Figg
her
quavery
voice
And
who
exactly
are
you
said
Fudge
bored
and
lofty
voice
resident
Little
Whinging
close
where
Harry
Potter
lives
said
Mrs
Figg
have
record
any
witch
wizard
living
Little
Whinging
other
than
Harry
Potter
said
Madam
Bones
once
That
situation
has
always
been
closely
monitored
given
given
past
events
Squib
said
Mrs
Figg
you
wouldn
have
registered
would
you
Squib
said
Fudge
eyeing
her
closely
checking
that
You
leave
details
your
parentage
with
assistant
Weasley
Incidentally
can
Squibs
see
Dementors
added
looking
left
and
right
along
the
bench
Yes
can
said
Mrs
Figg
indignantly
Fudge
looked
back
down
her
his
eyebrows
raised
Very
well
said
aloofly
What
your
story
had
gone
out
buy
cat
food
from
the
corner
shop
the
end
Wisteria
Walk
around
about
nine
clock
the
evening
the
second
August
gabbled
Mrs
Figg
once
though
she
had
learned
what
she
was
saying
heart
when
heard
disturbance
down
the
alleyway
between
Magnolia
Crescent
and
Wisteria
Walk
approaching
the
mouth
the
alleyway
saw
Dementors
running
Running
said
Madam
Bones
sharply
Dementors
don
run
they
glide
That
what
meant
say
said
Mrs
Figg
quickly
patches
pink
appearing
her
withered
cheeks
Gliding
along
the
alley
towards
what
looked
like
two
boys
What
did
they
look
like
said
Madam
Bones
narrowing
her
eyes
that
the
edge
the
monocle
disappeared
into
her
flesh
Well
one
was
very
large
and
the
other
one
rather
skinny
said
Madam
Bones
impatiently
The
Dementors
describe
them
said
Mrs
Figg
the
pink
flush
creeping
her
neck
now
They
were
big
Big
and
wearing
cloaks
Harry
felt
horrible
sinking
the
pit
his
stomach
Whatever
Mrs
Figg
might
say
sounded
him
though
the
most
she
had
ever
seen
was
picture
Dementor
and
picture
could
never
convey
the
truth
what
these
beings
were
like
the
eerie
way
they
moved
hovering
inches
over
the
ground
the
rotting
smell
them
that
terrible
rattling
noise
they
made
they
sucked
the
surrounding
air
the
second
row
dumpy
wizard
with
large
black
moustache
leaned
close
whisper
the
ear
his
neighbour
frizzy
haired
witch
She
smirked
and
nodded
Big
and
wearing
cloaks
repeated
Madam
Bones
coolly
while
Fudge
snorted
derisively
see
Anything
else
Yes
said
Mrs
Figg
felt
them
Everything
went
cold
and
this
was
very
warm
summer
night
mark
you
And
felt
though
all
happiness
had
gone
from
the
world
and
remembered
dreadful
things
Her
voice
shook
and
died
Madam
Bones
eyes
widened
slightly
Harry
could
see
red
marks
under
her
eyebrow
where
the
monocle
had
dug
into
What
did
the
Dementors
she
asked
and
Harry
felt
rush
hope
They
went
for
the
boys
said
Mrs
Figg
her
voice
stronger
and
more
confident
now
the
pink
flush
ebbing
away
from
her
face
One
them
had
fallen
The
other
was
backing
away
trying
repel
the
Dementor
That
was
Harry
tried
twice
and
produced
only
silver
vapour
the
third
attempt
produced
Patronus
which
charged
down
the
first
Dementor
and
then
with
his
encouragement
chased
the
second
one
away
from
his
cousin
And
that
that
what
happened
Mrs
Figg
finished
somewhat
lamely
Madam
Bones
looked
down
Mrs
Figg
silence
Fudge
was
not
looking
her
all
but
fidgeting
with
his
papers
Finally
raised
his
eyes
and
said
rather
aggressively
That
what
you
saw
That
what
happened
Mrs
Figg
repeated
Very
well
said
Fudge
You
may
Mrs
Figg
cast
frightened
look
from
Fudge
Dumbledore
then
got
and
shuffled
otf
towards
the
door
Harry
heard
thud
shut
behind
her
Not
very
convincing
witness
said
Fudge
loftily
don
know
said
Madam
Bones
her
booming
voice
She
certainly
described
the
effects
Dementor
attack
very
accurately
And
can
imagine
why
she
would
say
they
were
there
they
weren
But
Dementors
wandering
into
Muggle
suburb
and
justhappening
come
across
wizard
snorted
Fudge
The
odds
that
must
very
very
long
Even
Bagman
wouldn
have
bet
don
think
any
believe
the
Dementors
were
there
coincidence
said
Dumbledore
lightly
The
witch
sitting
the
right
Fudge
with
her
face
shadow
moved
slightly
but
everyone
else
was
quite
still
and
silent
And
what
that
supposed
mean
Fudge
asked
icily
means
that
think
they
were
ordered
there
said
Dumbledore
think
might
have
record
someone
had
ordered
pair
Dementors
strolling
through
Little
Whinging
barked
Fudge
Not
the
Dementors
are
taking
orders
from
someone
other
than
the
Ministry
Magic
these
days
said
Dumbledore
calmly
have
already
given
you
views
this
matter
Cornelius
Yes
you
have
said
Fudge
forcefully
and
have
reason
believe
that
your
views
are
anything
other
than
bilge
Dumbledore
The
Dementors
remain
place
Azkaban
and
are
doing
everything
ask
them
Then
said
Dumbledore
quietly
but
clearly
must
ask
ourselves
why
somebody
within
the
Ministry
ordered
pair
Dementors
into
that
alleyway
the
second
August
the
complete
silence
that
greeted
these
words
the
witch
the
right
Fudge
leaned
forwards
that
Harry
saw
her
for
the
first
time
thought
she
looked
just
like
large
pale
toad
She
was
rather
squat
with
broad
flabby
face
little
neck
Uncle
Vernon
and
very
wide
slack
mouth
Her
eyes
were
large
round
and
slightly
bulging

The
Chair

Dolores
Jane
Umbridge
Senior
Undersecretary
the
Minister
said
Fudge
The
witch
spoke
fluttery
girlish
high
pitched
voice
that
took
Harry
aback
had
been
expecting
croak
sure
must
have
misunderstood
you
Professor
Dumbledore
she
said
with
simper
that
left
her
big
round
eyes
cold
ever
silly
But
sounded
for
teensy
moment
though
you
were
suggesting
that
the
Ministry
Magic
had
ordered
attack
this
boy
She
gave
silvery
laugh
that
made
the
hairs
the
back
Harry
neck
stand
few
other
members
the
Wizengamot
laughed
with
her
could
not
have
been
plainer
that
not
one
them
was
really
amused
true
that
the
Dementors
are
taking
orders
only
from
the
Ministry
Magic
and
also
true
that
two
Dementors
attacked
Harry
and
his
cousin
week
ago
then
follows
logically
that
somebody
the
Ministry
might
have
ordered
the
attacks
said
Dumbledore
politely
course
these
particular
Dementors
may
have
been
outside
Ministry
control
There
are
Dementors
outside
Ministry
control
snapped
Fudge
who
had
turned
brick
red
Dumbledore
inclined
his
head
little
bow
Then
undoubtedly
the
Ministry
will
making
full
inquiry
into
why
two
Dementors
were
very
far
from
Azkaban
and
why
they
attacked
without
authorisation
not
for
you
decide
what
the
Ministry
Magic
does
does
not

Fudge

Uncle
Vernon

Dumbledore
mildly
was
merely
expressing
confidence
that

glanced
Madam
Bones
who
readjusted
her
monocle
and
stared
back
him
frowning
slightly
would
remind
everybody
that

Then

these

precisely
into
the

there

she
would
not

that
not

Fudge
fiddling
with

this
over
with

Dumbledore
But
naturally
you
would
not
care
how
many
times
you
heard
from

the
alternative
was
serious
miscarriage
justice
said
Dumbledore
Serious
miscarriage

said
Fudge
the
top
his
voice
Have
you

while

Anyway

banging
his
fist
the
judge
bench
and
upsetting
bottle
ink
And
you
very
kindly
did
not
press

that
occasion

that
even
the
best

cannot
always
control
their

said
Dumbledore
calmly
Fudge
attempted
scrub
the
ink
off
his
notes
And
haven
even
started
what
gets

But
the
Ministry
has

Harry
behaviour
there
not
relevant
this
hearing
said
Dumbledore
politely
ever
but
now
with
suggestion
coolness
behind
his
words
Oho
said
Fudge
Not
our
business
what
does
school
You
think
The
Ministry
does
not
have
the
power
expel
Hogwarts
students
Cornelius
reminded
you
the
night
the
second
August
said
Dumbledore
Nor
does
have
the
right
confiscate
wands
until
charges
have
been
successfully
proven
again
reminded
you
the
night
the
second
August
your
admirable
haste
ensure
that
the
law
upheld
you
appear
inadvertently
sure
have
overlooked
few
laws
yourself
Laws
can
changed
said
Fudge
savagely
course
they
can
said
Dumbledore
inclining
his
head
And
you
certainly
seem
making
many
changes
Cornelius
Why
the
few
short
weeks
since
was
asked
leave
the
Wizengamot
has
already
become
the
practice
hold
full
criminal
trial
deal
with
simple
matter
underage
magic
few
the
wizards
above
them
shifted
uncomfortably
their
seats
Fudge
turned
slightly
deeper
shade
puce
The
toadlike
witch
his
right
however
merely
gazed
Dumbledore
her
face
quite
expressionless
far
aware
Dumbledore
continued
there
law
yet
place
that
says
this
court
job
punish
Harry
for
every
bit
magic
has
ever
performed
has
been
charged
with
specific
offence
and
has
presented
his
defence
All
and
can
now
await
your
verdict
Dumbledore
put
his
fingertips
together
again
and
said
more
Fudge
glared
him
evidently
incensed
Harry
glanced
sideways
Dumbledore
seeking
reassurance
was
not
all
sure
that
Dumbledore
was
right
telling
the
Wizengamot
effect
that
was
about
time
they
made
decision
Again
however
Dumbledore
seemed
oblivious
Harry
attempt
catch
his
eye
continued
look
the
benches
where
the
entire
Wizengamot
had
fallen
into
urgent
whispered
conversations
Harry
looked
his
feet
His
heart
which
seemed
have
swollen
unnatural
size
was
thumping
loudly
under
his
ribs
had
expected
the
hearing
last
longer
than
this
was
not
all
sure
that
had
made
good
impression
had
not
really
said
very
much
ought
have
explained
more
fully
about
the
Dementors
about
how
had
fallen
over
about
how
both
and
Dudley
had
nearly
been
kissed
Twice
looked
Fudge
and
opened
his
mouth
speak
but
his
swollen
heart
was
now
constricting
his
air
passages
and
both
times
merely
took
deep
breath
and
looked
back
down
his
shoes
Then
the
whispering
stopped
Harry
wanted
look
the
judges
but
found
that
was
really
much
much
easier
keep
examining
his
laces
Those
favour
clearing
the
witness
all
charges
said
Madam
Boness
booming
voice
Harry
head
jerked
upwards
There
were
hands
the
air
many
them
more
than
half
Breathing
very
fast
tried
count
but
before
could
finish
Madam
Bones
had
said
And
those
favour
conviction
Fudge
raised
his
hand
did
half
dozen
others
including
the
witch
his
right
and
the
heavily
moustached
wizard
and
the
frizzy
haired
witch
the
second
row
Fudge
glanced
around
them
all
looking
though
there
was
something
large
stuck
his
throat
then
lowered
his
own
hand
took
two
deep
breaths
and
said
voice
distorted
suppressed
rage
Very
well
very
well
cleared
all
charges
Excellent
said
Dumbledore
briskly
springing
his
feet
pulling
out
his
wand
and
causing
the
two
chintz
armchairs
vanish
Well
must
getting
along
Good
day
you
all
And
without
looking
once
Harry
swept
from
the
dungeon
THE
WOES
MRS
WEASLEY
Dumbledore
abrupt
departure
took
Harry
completely
surprise
remained
sitting
where
was
the
chained
chair
struggling
with
his
feelings
shock
and
relief
The
Wizengamot
were
all
getting
their
feet
talking
gathering
their
papers
and
packing
them
away
Harry
stood
Nobody
seemed
tobe
paying
him
the
slightest
bit
attention
except
the
toadlike
witch
Fudge
right
who
was
now
gazing
down
him
instead
Dumbledore
Ignoring
her
tried
catch
Fudge
eye
Madam
Bones
wanting
ask
whether
was
free
but
Fudge
seemed
quite
determined
not
notice
Harry
and
Madam
Bones
was
busy
with
her
briefcase
took
few
tentative
steps
towards
the
exit
and
when
nobody
called
him
back
broke
into
very
fast
walk
took
the
last
few
steps
run
wrenched
open
the
door
and
almost
collided
with
Weasley
who
was
standing
right
outside
looking
pale
and
apprehensive
Dumbledore
didn
say
Cleared
Harry
said
pulling
the
door
closed
behind
him
all
charges
Beaming
Weasley
seized
Harry
the
shoulders
Harry
that
wonderful
Well
course
they
couldn
have
found
you
guilty
not
the
evidence
but
even
can
pretend
wasn
But
Weasley
broke
off
because
the
courtroom
door
had
just
opened
again
The
Wizengamot
were
filing
out
Merlin
beard
exclaimed
Weasley
wonderingly
pulling
Harry
aside
let
them
all
pass
You
were
tried
the
full
court
think
said
Harry
quietly
One
two
the
wizards
nodded
Harry
they
passed
and
few
including
Madam
Bones
said
Morning
Arthur
Weasley
but
most
averted
their
eyes
Cornelius
Fudge
and
the
toadlike
witch
were
almost
the
last
leave
the
dungeon
Fudge
acted
though
Weasley
and
Harry
were
part
the
wall
but
again
the
witch
looked
almost
appraisingly
Harry
she
passed
Last
all
pass
was
Percy
Like
Fudge
completely
ignored
his
father
and
Harry
marched
past
clutching
large
roll
parchment
and
handful
spare
quills
his
back
rigid
and
his
nose
the
air
The
lines
around
Weasley
mouth
tightened
slightly
but
other
than
this
gave
sign
that
had
seen
his
third
son
going
take
you
straight
back
you
can
tell
the
others
the
good
news
said
beckoning
Harry
forwards
Percy
heels
disappeared
the
steps
Level
Nine
drop
you
off
the
way
that
toilet
Bethnal
Green
Come
what
will
you
have
about
the
toilet
Harry
asked
grinning
Everything
suddenly
seemed
five
times
funnier
than
usual
was
starting
sink
was
cleared
was
going
back
Hogwarts
simple
enough
anti
jinx
said
Weasley
they
mounted
the
stairs
but
not
much
having
repair
the
damage
more
the
attitude
behind
the
vandalism
Harry
Muggle
baiting
might
strike
some
wizards
funny
but
expression
something
much
deeper
and
nastier
and
for
one
Weasley
broke
off
mid
sentence
They
had
just
reached
the
ninth
level
corridor
and
Cornelius
Fudge
was
standing
few
feet
away
from
them
talking
quietly
tall
man
with
sleek
blond
hair
and
pointed
pale
face
The
second
man
turned
the
sound
their
footsteps
too
broke
off
mid
conversation
his
cold
grey
eyes
narrowed
and
fixed
upon
Harry
face
Well
well
well
Patronus
Potter
said
Lucius
Malfoy
coolly
Harry
felt
winded
though
had
just
walked
into
something
solid
had
last
seen
those
cold
grey
eyes
through
slits
Death
Eater
hood
and
last
heard
that
man
voice
jeering
dark
graveyard
while
Lord
Voldemort
tortured
him
Harry
could
not
believe
that
Lucius
Malfoy
dared
look
him
the
face
could
not
believe
that
was
here
the
Ministry
Magic
that
Cornelius
Fudge
was
talking
him
when
Harry
had
told
Fudge
mere
weeks
ago
that
Malfoy
was
Death
Eater
The
Minister
was
just
telling
about
your
lucky
escape
Potter
drawled
Malfoy
Quite
astonishing
the
way
you
continue
wriggle
out
very
tight
holes
snakelike
fact
Weasley
gripped
Harry
shoulder
warning
Yeah
said
Harry
yeah
good
escaping
Lucius
Malfoy
raised
his
eyes
Weasley
face
And
Arthur
Weasley
too
What
are
you
doing
here
Arthur
work
here
said
Weasley
curtly
Nothere
surely
said
Malfoy
raising
his
eyebrows
and
glancing
towards
the
door
over
Weasley
shoulder
thought
you
were
the
second
floor
don
you
something
that
involves
sneaking
Muggle
artefacts
home
and
bewitching
them
Weasley
snapped
his
fingers
now
biting
into
Harry
shoulder
What
areyou
doing
here
anyway
Harry
asked
Lucius
Malfoy
don
think
private
matters
between
myself
and
the
Minister
are
any
concern
yours
Potter
said
Malfoy
smoothing
the
front
his
robes
Harry
distinctly
heard
the
gentle
clinking
what
sounded
like
full
pocket
gold
Really
just
because
you
are
Dumbledore
favourite
boy
you
must
not
expect
the
same
indulgence
from
the
rest
shall
your
office
then
Minister
Certainly
said
Fudge
turning
his
back
Harry
and
Weasley
This
way
Lucius
They
strode
off
together
talking
low
voices
Weasley
did
not
let
Harry
shoulder
until
they
had
disappeared
into
the
lift
Why
wasn
waiting
outside
Fudge
office
they
got
business
together
Harry
burst
out
furiously
What
was
doing
down
here
Trying
sneak
down
the
courtroom
you
ask
said
Weasley
looking
extremely
agitated
and
glancing
over
his
shoulder
though
making
sure
they
could
not
overheard
Trying
find
out
whether
you
been
expelled
not
leave
note
for
Dumbledore
when
drop
you
off
ought
know
Malfoy
been
talking
Fudge
again
What
private
business
have
they
got
together
anyway
Gold
expect
said
Weasley
angrily
Malfoy
been
giving
generously
all
sorts
things
for
years
gets
him
with
the
right
people
then
can
ask
favours
delay
laws
doesn
want
passed
very
well
connected
Lucius
Malfoy
The
lift
arrived
was
empty
except
for
flock
memos
that
flapped
around
Weasley
head
pressed
the
button
for
the
Atrium
and
the
doors
clanged
shut
waved
them
away
irritably
Weasley
said
Harry
slowly
Fudge
meeting
Death
Eaters
like
Malfoy
seeing
them
alone
how
know
they
haven
put
the
Imperius
Curse
him
Don
think
hasn
occurred
Harry
said
Weasley
quietly
But
Dumbledore
thinks
Fudge
acting
his
own
accord
the
moment
which
Dumbledore
says
not
lot
comfort
Best
not
talk
about
any
more
just
now
Harry
The
doors
slid
open
and
they
stepped
out
into
the
now
almost
deserted
Atrium
Eric
the
watchwizard
was
hidden
behind
hisDaily
Prophet
again
They
had
walked
straight
past
the
golden
fountain
before
Harry
remembered
Wait
told
Weasley
and
pulling
his
moneybag
Irom
his
pocket
turned
back
the
fountain
looked
into
the
handsome
wizard
face
but
close
Harry
thought
looked
rather
weak
and
foolish
The
witch
was
wearing
vapid
smile
like
beauty
contestant
and
from
what
Harry
knew
goblins
and
centaurs
they
were
most
unlikely
caught
staring
soppily
humans
any
description
Only
the
house
elf
attitude
creeping
servility
looked
convincing
With
grin
the
thought
what
Hermione
would
say
she
could
see
the
statue
the
elf
Harry
turned
his
moneybag
upside
down
and
emptied
not
just
ten
Galleons
but
the
whole
contents
into
the
pool
knew
yelled
Ron
punching
the
air
You
always
get
away
with
stuff
They
were
bound
clear
you
said
Hermione
who
had
looked
positively
faint
with
anxiety
when
Harry
had
entered
the
kitchen
and
was
now
holding
shaking
hand
over
her
eyes
there
was
case
against
you
none
all
Everyone
seems
quite
relieved
though
considering
you
all
knew
get
off
said
Harry
smiling
Mrs
Weasley
was
wiping
her
face
her
apron
and
Fred
George
and
Ginny
were
doing
kind
war
dance
chant
that
went
got
off
got
off
got
off
That
enough
Settle
down
shouted
Weasley
though
too
was
smiling
Listen
Sirius
Lucius
Malfoy
was
the
Ministry
What
said
Sirius
sharply
got
off
got
off
got
off
quiet
you
three
Yes
saw
him
talking
Fudge
Level
Nine
then
they
went
Fudge
office
together
Dumbledore

know
Absolutely
said
Sirius
tell
him
don
worry
Well
better
get
going
there
vomiting
toilet
waiting
for
Bethnal
Green
Molly
late
covering
for
Tonks
but
Kingsley
might
dropping
for
dinner
got
off
got
off

off
That
enough
Fred
George
Ginny
said
Mrs
Weasley
Weasley
left
the
kitchen
Harry
dear
come
and
sit
down
have
some
lunch
you
hardly
ate
breakfast
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
themselves
down
opposite
him
looking
happier
than
they
had
done
since
had
first
arrived
Grimmauld
Place
and
Harry
feeling
giddy
relief
which
had
been
somewhat
dented
his
encounter
with
Lucius
Malfoy
swelled
again
The
gloomy
house
seemed
warmer
and
more
welcoming
all
sudden
even
Kreacher
looked
less
ugly
poked
his
snoutlike
nose
into
the
kitchen
investigate
the
source
all
the
noise
Course
once
Dumbledore
turned
your
side
there
was
way
they
were
going
convict
you
said
Ron
happily
now
dishing
great
mounds
mashed
potato
everyone
plates
Yeah
swung
for
said
Harry
felt
would
sound
highly
ungrateful
not
mention
childish
say
wish
talked
though
evenlooked
And
thought
this
the
scar
his
forehead
burned
badly
that
clapped
his
hand
What
said
Hermione
looking
alarmed
Scar
Harry
mumbled
But
nothing
happens
all
the
time
now
None
the
others
had
noticed
thing
all
them
were
now
helping
themselves
food
while
gloating
over
Harry
narrow
escape
Fred
George
and
Ginny
were
still
singing
Hermione
looked
rather
anxious
but
before
she
could
say
anything
Ron
had
said
happily
bet
Dumbledore
turns
this
evening
celebrate
with
you
know
don
think
able
Ron
said
Mrs
Weasley
setting
huge
plate
roast
chicken
down
front
Harry
really
very
busy
the
moment
GOT
OFF
GOT
OFF
GOT
OFF
SHUT
roared
Mrs
Weasley
Over
the
next
few
days
Harry
could
not
help
noticing
that
there
was
one
person
within
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
who
did
not
seem
wholly
overjoyed
that
would
returning
Hogwarts
Sirius
had
put
very
good
show
happiness
first
hearing
the
news
wringing
Harry
hand
and
beaming
just
like
the
rest
them
Soon
however
was
moodier
and
surlier
than
before
talking
less
everybody
even
Harry
and
spending
increasing
amounts
time
shut
his
mother
room
with
Buckbeak
Don
you
feeling
guilty
said
Hermione
sternly
after
Harry
had
confided
some
his
feelings
her
and
Ron
while
they
scrubbed
out
mouldy
cupboard
the
third
floor
few
days
later
You
belong
Hogwarts
and
Sirius
knows
Personally
think
being
selfish
That
bit
harsh
Hermione
said
Ron
frowning
attempted
prise
off
bit
mould
that
had
attached
itself
firmly
his
finger
you
wouldn
want
stuck
inside
this
house
without
any
company
have
company
said
Hermione
Headquarters
the
Order
the
Phoenix
isn
just
got
his
hopes
that
Harry
would
coming
live
here
with
him
don
think
that
true
said
Harry
wringing
out
his
cloth
wouldn
give
straight
answer
when
asked
him
could
just
didn
want
get
his
own
hopes
even
more
said
Hermione
wisely
And
probably
felt
bit
guilty
himself
because
think
part
him
was
really
hoping
you
expelled
Then
you
both
outcasts
together
Come
off
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
but
Hermione
merely
shrugged
Suit
yourselves
But
sometimes
think
Ron
mum
right
and
Sirius
gets
confused
about
whether
you
you
your
father
Harry
you
think
touched
the
head
said
Harry
heatedly
just
think
been
very
lonely
for
long
time
said
Hermione
simply
this
point
Mrs
Weasley
entered
the
bedroom
behind
them
Still
not
finished
she
said
poking
her
head
into
the
cupboard
thought
you
might
here
tell
have
break
said
Ron
bitterly
you
know
how
much
mould
got
rid
since
arrived
here
You
were
keen
help
the
Order
said
Mrs
Weasley
you
can
your
bit
making
Headquarters
fit
live
feel
like
house
elf
grumbled
Ron
Well
now
you
understand
what
dreadful
lives
they
lead
perhaps
you
bit
more
active
said
Hermione
hopefully
Mrs
Weasley
left
them
You
know
maybe
wouldn
bad
idea
show
people
exactly
how
horrible
clean
all
the
time
could
sponsored
scrub
Gryffindor
common
room
all
proceeds
would
raise
awareness
well
funds
sponsor
you
shut
about
Ron
muttered
irritably
but
only
Harry
could
hear
him
Harry
found
himself
daydreaming
about
Hogwarts
more
and
more
the
end
the
holidays
approached
could
not
wait
see
Hagrid
again
play
Quidditch
even
stroll
across
the
vegetable
patches
the
Herbology
greenhouses
would
treat
just
leave
this
dusty
musty
house
where
half
the
cupboards
were
still
bolted
shut
and
Kreacher
wheezed
insults
out
the
shadows
you
passed
though
Harry
was
careful
not
say
any
this
within
earshot
Sirius
The
fact
was
that
living
the
Headquarters
the
anti
Voldemort
movement
was
not
nearly
interesting
exciting
Harry
would
have
expected
before
experienced
Though
members
the
Order
the
Phoenix
came
and
went
regularly
sometimes
staying
for
meals
sometimes
only
for
few
minutes
whispered
conversation
Mrs
Weasley
made
sure
that
Harry
and
the
others
were
kept
well
out
earshot
whether
Extendable
normal
and
nobody
not
even
Sirius
seemed
feel
that
Harry
needed
know
anything
more
than
had
heard
the
night
his
arrival
the
very
last
day
the
holidays
Harry
was
sweeping
Hedwig
owl
droppings
from
the
top
the
wardrobe
when
Ron
entered
their
bedroom
carrying
couple
envelopes
Booklists
have
arrived
said
throwing
one
the
envelopes
Harry
who
was
standing
chair
About
time
thought
they
forgotten
they
usually
come
much
earlier
than
this
Harry
swept
the
last
the
droppings
into
rubbish
bag
and
threw
the
bag
over
Ron
head
into
the
wastepaper
basket
the
corner
which
swallowed
and
belched
loudly
then
opened
his
letter
contained
two
pieces
parchment
one
the
usual
reminder
that
term
started
the
first
September
the
other
telling
him
which
books
would
need
for
the
coming
year
Only
two
new
ones
said
reading
the
list
The
Standard
Book
Spells
Grade
Miranda
Goshawk
andDefensive
Magical
Theory
Wilbert
Slinkhard
Crack
Fred
and
George
Apparated
right
beside
Harry
was
used
them
doing
this
now
that
didn
even
fall
off
his
chair
were
just
wondering
who
set
the
Slinkhard
book
said
Fred
conversationally
Because
means
Dumbledore
found
new
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
said
George
And
about
time
too
said
Fred
What
you
mean
Harry
asked
jumping
down
beside
them
Well
overheard
Mum
and
Dad
talking
the
Extendable
Ears
few
weeks
back
Fred
told
Harry
and
from
what
they
were
saying
Dumbledore
was
having
real
trouble
finding
anyone
the
job
this
year
Not
surprising
when
you
look
what
happened
the
last
four
said
George
One
sacked
one
dead
one
memory
removed
and
one
locked
trunk
for
nine
months
said
Harry
counting
them
off
his
fingers
Yeah
see
what
you
mean
What
with
you
Ron
asked
Fred
Ron
did
not
answer
Harry
looked
round
Ron
was
standing
very
still
with
his
mouth
slightly
open
gaping
his
letter
from
Hogwarts
What
the
matter
said
Fred
impatiently
moving
around
Ron
look
over
his
shoulder
the
parchment
Fred
mouth
fell
open
too
Prefect
said
staring
incredulously
the
letter
Prefect
George
leapt
forwards
seized
the
envelope
Ron
other
hand
and
turned
upside
down
Harry
saw
something
scarlet
and
gold
fall
into
George
palm
way
said
George
hushed
voice
There
been
mistake
said
Fred
snatching
the
letter
out
Ron
grasp
and
holding
the
light
though
checking
for
watermark
one
their
right
mind
would
make
Ron
prefect
The
twins
heads
turned
unison
and
both
them
stared
Harry
thought
you
were
cert
said
Fred
tone
that
suggested
Harry
had
tricked
them
some
way
thought
Dumbledore
wasbound
pick
you
said
George
indignantly
Winning
the
Triwizard
and
everything
said
Fred
suppose
all
the
mad
stuff
must
counted
against
him
said
George
Fred
Yeah
said
Fred
slowly
Yeah
you
caused
too
much
trouble
mate
Well
least
one
you
got
their
priorities
right
strode
over
Harry
and
clapped
him
the
back
while
giving
Ron
scathing
look
Prefect
ickle
Ronnie
the
Prefect
Ohh
Mum
going
revolting
groaned
George
thrusting
the
prefect
badge
back
Ron
though
might
contaminate
him
Ron
who
still
had
not
said
word
took
the
badge
stared
for
moment
then
held
out
Harry
though
asking
mutely
for
confirmation
that
was
genuine
Harry
took
large
was
superimposed
the
Gryffindor
lion
had
seen
badge
just
like
this
Percy
chest
his
very
first
day
Hogwarts
The
door
banged
open
Hermione
came
tearing
into
the
room
her
cheeks
flushed
and
her
hair
flying
There
was
envelope
her
hand
Did
you
did
you
get
She
spotted
the
badge
Harry
hand
and
let
out
shriek
knew
she
said
excitedly
brandishing
her
letter
too
Harry

said
Harry
quickly
pushing
the
badge
back
into
Ron
hand
Ron
not
what
Ron
prefect

Harry
said
Ron
said
Hermione
her
jaw
dropping
But
are
you
sure
mean
She
turned
red
Ron
looked
round
her
with
defiant
expression
his
face
name
the
letter
said
said
Hermione
looking
thoroughly
bewildered
well
wow
Well
done
Ron
That
really
Unexpected
said
George
nodding
said
Hermione
blushing
harder
than
ever
not
Ron
done
loads
really
The
door
behind
her
opened
little
wider
and
Mrs
Weasley
backed
into
the
room
carrying
pile
freshly
laundered
robes
Ginny
said
the
booklists
had
come
last
she
said
glancing
around
all
the
envelopes
she
made
her
way
over
the
bed
and
started
sorting
the
robes
into
two
piles
you
give
them
take
them
over
Diagon
Alley
this
afternoon
and
get
your
books
while

Get

George
smirking
Match

Mrs
Weasley
absently
rolling

maroon
socks
and
placing

Hisbadge
said
Fred
with
the
air
getting
the
worst
over
quickly
His
lovely
shiny
newprefect

Fred
words
took
moment
penetrate
Mrs
Weasley
preoccupation
with
pyjamas
His
but
Ron

Ron

Mrs

let

just
like
Hermione

Ron

That

family
What

Fred
and
next
door
neighbours
said
George
indignantly
his
mother
pushed
him
aside
and
flung
her
arms
around
her
youngest
son
Wait
until
your
father
hears
Ron
proud
you
what
wonderful
news
you
could
end
Head
Boy
just
like
Bill
and
Percy
the
first
step
what
thing

the
middle
all
this
worry
just
thrilled
Ronnie
Fred
and
George
were
both
making
loud
retching
noises
behind
her
back
but
Mrs
Weasley
did
not
notice
arms
tight
around
Ron
neck
she
was
kissing
him
all
over
his
face
which
had
turned
brighter
scarlet
than
his
badge
Mum
don
Mum
get
grip
muttered
trying
push
her
away
She
let
him
and
said
breathlessly
Well
what
will
gave
Percy
owl
but
you
already
got
one
course
what
you
mean
said
Ron
looking
though
did
not
dare
believe
his
ears
You

reward
for
this
said
Mrs
Weasley
fondly
How
about
nice
new
set

said
Fred
sourly
who
looked
though
sincerely
regretted
this
generosity
new
cauldron
Charlie
old
one
rusting
through
new
rat
you
always
liked
Scabbers
Mum
said
Ron
hopefully

have
new

Mrs
Weasley
face
fell
slightly
broomsticks
were
expensive
Not
really
good
one
Ron
hastened
add
Just
just
new
one
for
change
Mrs
Weasley
hesitated
then
smiled
Ofcourse
you
can
well

get
going
got
broom

too
see
you
all
later
little
Ronnie
prefect
And
don
forget

your
trunks
prefect
all
dither
She
gave
Ron
yet
another
kiss
the
cheek
sniffed
loudly
and
bustled
from
the
room
Fred
and
George
exchanged
looks
You
don
mind
don
kiss
you
you
Ron
said
Fred
falsely
anxious
voice
could
curtsey
you
like
said
George
shut
said
Ron
scowling
them
what
said
Fred
evil
grin
spreading
across
his
face
Going
put
detention
love
see
him
try
sniggered
George
could
you
don
watch
out
said
Hermione
angrily
Fred
and
George
burst
out
laughing
and
Ron
muttered
Drop
Hermione
going
have
watch
our
step
George
said
Fred
pretending
tremble
with
these
two
our
case
Yeah
looks
like
our
law
breaking
days
are
finally
over
said
George
shaking
his
head
And
with
another
loudcrack
the
twins
Disapparated
Those
two
said
Hermione
furiously
staring
the
ceiling
through
which
they
could
now
hear
Fred
and
George
roaring
with
laughter
the
room
upstairs
Don
pay
any
attention
them
Ron
they
only
jealous
don
think
they
are
said
Ron
doubtfully
also
looking
the
ceiling
They
always
said
only
prats
become
prefects
still
added
happier
note
they
never
had
new
brooms
wish
could
with
Mum
and
choose
she
never
able
afford
Nimbus
but
there
the
new
Cleansweep
out
that
great
yeah
think
and
tell
her
like
the
Cleansweep
just
she
knows
dashed
from
the
room
leaving
Harry
and
Hermione
alone
For
some
reason
Harry
found
did
not
want
look
Hermione
turned
his
bed
picked
the
pile
clean
robes
Mrs
Weasley
had
laid
and
crossed
the
room
his
trunk
Harry
said
Hermione
tentatively
Well
done
Hermione
said
Harry
heartily
did
not
sound
like
his
voice
all
and
still
not
looking
her
brilliant
Prefect
Great
Thanks
said
Hermione
Erm
Harry
could
borrow
Hedwig
can
tell
Mum
and
Dad
They
really
pleased
meanprefect
something
they
can
understand
Yeah
problem
said
Harry
still
the
horrible
hearty
voice
that
did
not
belong
him
Take
her
leaned
over
his
trunk
laid
the
robes
the
bottom
and
pretended
rummaging
for
something
while
Hermione
crossed
the
wardrobe
and
called
Hedwig
down
few
moments
passed
Harry
heard
the
door
close
but
remained
bent
double
listening
the
only
sounds
could
hear
were
the
blank
picture
the
wall
sniggering
again
and
the
wastepaper
basket
the
corner
coughing
the
owl
droppings
straightened
and
looked
behind
him
Hermione
had
left
and
Hedwig
had
gone
Harry
hurried
across
the
room
closed
the
door
then
returned
slowly
his
bed
and
sank
gazing
unseeingly
the
foot
the
wardrobe
had
forgotten
completely
about
prefects
being
chosen
the
fifth
year
had
been
too
anxious
about
the
possibility
being
expelled
spare
thought
for
the
fact
that
badges
must
winging
their
way
towards
certain
people
But
hehad
remembered
hehad
thought
about
what
would
have
expected
Not
this
said
small
and
truthful
voice
inside
his
head
Harry
screwed
his
face
and
buried
his
hands
could
not
lie
himself
had
known
the
prefect
badge
was
its
way
would
have
expected
come
him
not
Ron
Did
this
make
him
arrogant
Draco
Malfoy
Did
think
himself
superior
everyone
else
Did
really
believe
wasbetter
than
Ron
said
the
small
voice
defiantly
Was
that
true
Harry
wondered
anxiously
probing
his
own
feelings
better
Quidditch
said
the
voice
But
not
better
anything
else
That
was
definitely
true
Harry
thought
was
better
than
Ron
lessons
But
what
about
outside
lessons
What
about
those
adventures
Ron
and
Hermione
had
had
together
since
starting
Hogwarts
often
risking
much
worse
than
expulsion
Well
Ron
and
Hermione
were
with
most
the
time
said
the
voice
Harry
head
Not
all
the
time
though
Harry
argued
with
himself
They
didn
fight
Quirrell
with
They
didn
take
Riddle
and
the
Basilisk
They
didn
get
rid
all
those
Dementors
the
night
Sirius
escaped
They
weren
that
graveyard
with
the
night
Voldemort
returned
And
the
same
feeling
ill
usage
that
had
overwhelmed
him
the
night
had
arrived
rose
again
definitely
done
more
Harry
thought
indignantly
done
more
than
either
them
But
maybe
said
the
small
voice
fairly
maybe
Dumbledore
doesn
choose
prefects
because
they
got
themselves
into
load
dangerous
situations
maybe
chooses
them
for
other
reasons
Ron
must
have
something
you
don
Harry
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
through
his
fingers
the
wardrobe
clawed
feet
remembering
what
Fred
had
said
one
their
right
mind
would
make
Ron
prefect
Harry
gave
small
snort
laughter
second
later
felt
sickened
with
himself
Ron
had
not
asked
Dumbledore
give
him
the
prefect
badge
This
was
not
Ron
fault
Was
Harry
Ron
best
friend
the
world
going
sulk
because
didn
have
badge
laugh
with
the
twins
behind
Ron
back
ruin
this
for
Ron
when
for
the
first
time
had
beaten
Harry
something
this
point
Harry
heard
Ron
footsteps
the
stairs
again
stood
straightened
his
glasses
and
hitched
grin
his
face
Ron
bounded
back
through
the
door
Just
caught
her
said
happily
She
says
she
get
the
Cleansweep
she
can
Cool
Harry
said
and
was
relieved
hear
that
his
voice
had
stopped
sounding
hearty
Listen
Ron
well
done
mate
The
smile
faded
off
Ron
face
never
thought
would
said
shaking
his
head
thought
would
you
Nah
caused
too
much
trouble
Harry
said
echoing
Fred
Yeah
said
Ron
yeah
suppose
well
better
get
our
trunks
packed
hadn
was
odd
how
widely
their
possessions
seemed
have
scattered
themselves
since
they
had
arrived
took
them
most
the
afternoon
retrieve
their
books
and
belongings
from
all
over
the
house
and
stow
them
back
inside
their
school
trunks
Harry
noticed
that
Ron
kept
moving
his
prefects
badge
around
first
placing
his
bedside
table
then
putting
into
his
jeans
pocket
then
taking
out
and
lying
his
folded
robes
though
see
the
effect
the
red
the
black
Only
when
Fred
and
George
dropped
and
offered
attach
his
forehead
with
Permanent
Sticking
Charm
did
wrap
tenderly
his
maroon
socks
and
lock
his
trunk
Mrs
Weasley
returned
from
Diagon
Alley
around
six
clock
laden
with
books
and
carrying
long
package
wrapped
thick
brown
paper
that
Ron
took
from
her
with
moan
longing
Never
mind
unwrapping
now
people
are
arriving
for
dinner
want
you
all
downstairs
she
said
but
the
moment
she
was
out
sight
Ron
ripped
off
the
paper
frenzy
and
examined
every
inch
his
new
broom
ecstatic
expression
his
face
Down
the
basement
Mrs
Weasley
had
hung
scarlet
banner
over
the
heavily
laden
dinner
table
which
read
CONGRATULATIONS
RON
AND
HERMIONE
NEW
PREFECTS
She
looked
better
mood
than
Harry
had
seen
her
all
holiday
thought
have
little
party
not
sit
down
dinner
she
told
Harry
Ron
Hermione
Fred
George
and
Ginny
they
entered
the
room
Your
father
and
Bill
are
their
way
Ron
sent
them
both
owls
and
they
rethrilled
she
added
beaming
Fred
rolled
his
eyes
Sirius
Lupin
Tonks
and
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
were
already
there
and
Mad
Eye
Moody
stumped
shortly
after
Harry
had
got
himself
Butterbeer
Alastor
glad
you
here
said
Mrs
Weasley
brightly
Mad
Eye
shrugged
off
his
travelling
cloak
been
wanting
ask
you
for
ages
could
you
have
look
the
writing
desk
the
drawing
room
and
tell
what
inside
haven
wanted
open
just
case
something
really
nasty
problem
Molly
Moody
electric
blue
eye
swivelled
upwards
and
stared
fixedly
through
the
ceiling
the
kitchen
Drawing
room
growled
the
pupil
contracted
Desk
the
corner
Yeah
see
yeah
Boggart
want
and
get
rid
Molly
myself
later
beamed
Mrs
Weasley
you
have
your
drink
having
little
bit
celebration
actually
She
gestured
the
scarlet
banner
Fourth
prefect
the
family
she
said
fondly
ruffling
Ron
hair
Prefect
growled
Moody
his
normal
eye
Ron
and
his
magical
eye
swivelling
around
gaze
into
the
side
his
head
Harry
had
the
very
uncomfortable
feeling
was
looking
him
and
moved
away
towards
Sirius
and
Lupin
Well
congratulations
said
Moody
still
glaring
Ron
with
his
normal
eye
authority
figures
always
attract
trouble
but
suppose
Dumbledore
thinks
you
can
withstand
most
major
jinxes
wouldn
have
appointed
you
Ron
looked
rather
startled
this
view
the
matter
but
was
saved
the
trouble
responding
the
arrival
his
father
and
eldest
brother
Mrs
Weasley
was
such
good
mood
she
did
not
even
complain
that
they
had
brought
Mundungus
with
them
was
wearing
long
overcoat
that
seemed
oddly
lumpy
unlikely
places
and
declined
the
offer
remove
and
put
with
Moody
travelling
cloak
Well
think
toast
order
said
Weasley
when
everyone
had
drink
raised
his
goblet
Ron
and
Hermione
the
new
Gryffindor
prefects
Ron
and
Hermione
beamed
everyone
drank
them
and
then
applauded
was
never
prefect
myself
said
Tonks
brightly
from
behind
Harry
everybody
moved
towards
the
table
help
themselves
food
Her
hair
was
tomato
red
and
waist
length
today
she
looked
like
Ginny
older
sister
Head
House
said
lacked
certain
necessary
qualities
Like
what
said
Ginny
who
was
choosing
baked
potato
Like
the
ability
behave
myself
said
Tonks
Ginny
laughed
Hermione
looked
though
she
did
not
know
whether
smile
not
and
compromised
taking
extra
large
gulp
Butterbeer
and
choking
What
about
you
Sirius
Ginny
asked
thumping
Hermione
the
back
Sirius
who
was
right
beside
Harry
let
out
his
usual
bark
like
laugh
one
would
have
made
prefect
spent
too
much
time
detention
with
James
Lupin
was
the
good
boy
got
the
badge
think
Dumbledore
might
have
hoped
would
able
exercise
some
control
over
best
friends
said
Lupin
need
scarcely
say
that
failed
dismally
Harry
mood
suddenly
lifted
His
father
had
not
been
prefect
either
All
once
the
party
seemed
much
more
enjoyable
loaded
his
plate
feeling
doubly
fond
everyone
the
room
Ron
was
rhapsodising
about
his
new
broom
anybody
who
would
listen
nought
seventy
ten
seconds
not
bad
When
you
think
the
Comet
Two
Ninety
only
nought
sixty
and
that
with
decent
tailwind
according
toWhich
Broomstick
Hermione
was
talking
very
earnestly
Lupin
about
her
view
elf
rights
mean
the
same
kind
nonsense
werewolf
segregation
isn
all
stems
from
this
horrible
thing
wizards
have
thinking
they
superior
other
creatures
Mrs
Weasley
and
Bill
were
having
their
usual
argument
about
Bill
hair
getting
really
out
hand
and
you
good
looking
would
look
much
better
shorter
wouldn
Harry
dunno
said
Harry
slightly
alarmed
being
asked
his
opinion
slid
away
from
them
the
direction
Fred
and
George
who
were
huddled
corner
with
Mundungus
Mundungus
stopped
talking
when
saw
Harry
but
Fred
winked
and
beckoned
Harry
closer
Its
told
Mundungus
can
trust
Harry
our
financial
backer
Look
what
Dung
got
said
George
holding
out
his
hand
Harry
was
full
what
looked
like
shrivelled
black
pods
faint
rattling
noise
was
coming
from
them
even
though
they
were
completely
stationary
Venomous
Tentacula
seeds
said
George
need
them
for
the
Skiving
Snackboxes
but
they
Class
Non
Tradeable
Substance
been
having
bit
trouble
getting
hold
them
Ten
Galleons
the
lot
then
Dung
said
Fred
Wiv
all
the
trouble
went
get
said
Mundungus
his
saggy
bloodshot
eyes
stretching
even
wider
sorry
lads
but
not
taking
Knut
under
twenty
Dung
likes
his
little
joke
Fred
said
Harry
Yeah
his
best
one
far
has
been
six
Sickles
for
bag
Knarl
quills
said
George
careful
Harry
warned
them
quietly
What
said
Fred
Mum
busy
cooing
over
Prefect
Ron
But
Moody
could
have
his
eye
you
Harry
pointed
out
Mundungus
looked
nervously
over
his
shoulder
Good
point
that
grunted
All
right
lads
ten
you
take
quick
Cheers
Harry
said
Fred
delightedly
when
Mundungus
had
emptied
his
pockets
into
the
twins
outstretched
hands
and
scuttled
off
towards
the
food
better
get
these
upstairs
Harry
watched
them
feeling
slightly
uneasy
had
just
occurred
him
that
and
Mrs
Weasley
would
want
know
how
Fred
and
George
were
financing
their
joke
shop
business
when
was
inevitable
they
finally
found
out
about
Giving
the
twins
his
Triwizard
winnings
had
seemed
simple
thing
the
time
but
what
led
another
family
row
and
Percy
like
estrangement
Would
Mrs
Weasley
still
feel
that
Harry
was
good
her
son
she
lound
out
had
made
possible
for
Fred
and
George
start
career
she
thought
quite
unsuitable
Standing
where
the
twins
had
left
him
with
nothing
but
guilty
weight
the
pit
his
stomach
for
company
Harry
caught
the
sound
his
own
name
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
deep
voice
was
audible
even
over
the
surrounding
chatter
why
Dumbledore
didn
make
Potter
prefect
said
Kingsley
have
had
his
reasons
replied
Lupin
But
would
shown
confidence
him
what
done
persisted
Kingsley
specially
with
theDaily
Prophet
having
him
every
few
days
Harry
did
not
look
round
did
not
want
Lupin
Kingsley
know
had
heard
Though
not
remotely
hungry
followed
Mundungus
back
towards
the
table
His
pleasure
the
party
had
evaporated
quickly
had
come
wished
were
upstairs
bed
Mad
Eye
Moody
was
sniffing
chicken
leg
with
what
remained
his
nose
evidently
could
not
detect
any
trace
poison
because
then
tore
strip
off
with
his
teeth
the
handles
made
Spanish
oak
with
anti
jinx
varnish
and
built
vibration
control
Ron
was
saying
Tonks
Mrs
Weasley
yawned
widely
Well
think
sort
out
that
Boggart
before
turn
Arthur
don
want
this
lot
too
late
all
right
Night
Harry
dear
She
left
the
kitchen
Harry
set
down
his
plate
and
wondered
whether
could
follow
her
without
attracting
attention
You
all
right
Potter
grunted
Moody
Yeah
fine
lied
Harry
Moody
took
swig
from
his
hipflask
his
electric
blue
eye
staring
sideways
Harry
Come
here
got
something
that
might
interest
you
said
From
inner
pocket
his
robes
Moody
pulled
very
tattered
old
wizarding
photograph
Original
Order
the
Phoenix
growled
Moody
Found
last
night
when
was
looking
for
spare
Invisibility
Cloak
seeing
Podmore
hasn
had
the
manners
return
best
one
thought
people
might
like
see
Harry
took
the
photograph
small
crowd
people
some
waving
him
others
lifting
their
glasses
looked
back
him
There
said
Moody
unnecessarily
pointing
himself
The
Moody
the
picture
was
unmistakeable
though
his
hair
was
slightly
less
grey
and
his
nose
was
intact
And
there
Dumbledore
beside
Dedalus
Diggle
the
other
side
that
Marlene
McKinnon
she
was
killed
two
weeks
after
this
was
taken
they
got
her
whole
family
That
Frank
and
Alice
Longbottom
Harry
stomach
already
uncomfortable
clenched
looked
Alice
Longbottom
knew
her
round
friendly
face
very
well
even
though
had
never
met
her
because
she
was
the
image
her
son
Neville
poor
devils
growled
Moody
Better
dead
than
what
happened
them
and
that
Emmeline
Vance
you
met
her
and
that
there
Lupin
obviously
Benjy
Fenwick
copped
too
only
ever
found
bits
him
shift
aside
there
added
poking
the
picture
and
the
little
photographic
people
edged
sideways
that
those
who
were
partially
obscured
could
move
the
front
That
Edgar
Bones
brother
Amelia
Bones
they
got
him
and
his
family
too
was
great
wizard
Sturgis
Podmore
blimey
looks
young
Caradoc
Dearborn
vanished
six
months
after
this
never
found
his
body
Hagrid
course
looks
exactly
the
same
ever
Elphias
Doge
you
met
him
forgotten
used
wear
that
stupid
hat
Gideon
Prewett
took
five
Death
Eaters
kill
him
and
his
brother
Fabian
they
fought
like
heroes
budge
along
budge
along
The
little
people
the
photograph
jostled
among
themselves
and
those
hidden
right
the
back
appeared
the
forefront
the
picture
That
Dumbledore
brother
Aberforth
only
time
ever
met
him
strange
bloke
that
Dorcas
Meadowes
Voldemort
killed
her
personally
Sirius
when
still
had
short
hair
and
there
you
thought
that
would
interest
you
Harry
heart
turned
over
His
mother
and
father
were
beaming
him
sitting
either
side
small
watery
eyed
man
whom
Harry
recognised
once
Wormtail
the
one
who
had
betrayed
his
parents
whereabouts
Voldemort
and
helped
bring
about
their
deaths
said
Moody
Harry
looked
into
Moody
heavily
scarred
and
pitted
face
Evidently
Moody
was
under
the
impression
had
just
given
Harry
bit
treat
Yeah
said
Harry
once
again
attempting
grin
listen
just
remembered
haven
packed
was
spared
the
trouble
inventing
object
had
not
packed
Sirius
had
just
said
What
that
you
got
there
Mad
Eye
and
Moody
had
turned
towards
him
Harry
crossed
the
kitchen
slipped
through
the
door
and
the
stairs
before
anyone
could
call
him
back
did
not
know
why
had
been
such
shock
had
seen
pictures
his
parents
before
after
all
and
had
met
Wormtail
but
have
them
sprung
him
like
that
when
was
least
expecting
one
would
like
that
thought
angrily
And
then
see
them
surrounded
all
those
other
happy
faces
Benjy
Eenwick
who
had
been
found
bits
and
Gideon
Prewett
who
had
died
like
hero
and
the
Longbottoms
who
had
been
tortured
into
madness
all
waving
happily
out
the
photograph
forever
more
not
knowing
that
they
were
doomed
well
Moody
might
find
that
interesting
Harry
found
disturbing
Harry
tiptoed
the
stairs
the
hall
past
the
stuffed
elf
heads
glad
his
own
again
but
approached
the
first
landing
heard
noises
Someone
was
sobbing
the
drawing
room
Hello
Harry
said
There
was
answer
but
the
sobbing
continued
climbed
the
remaining
stairs
two
time
walked
across
the
landing
and
opened
the
drawing
room
door
Someone
was
cowering
against
the
dark
wall
her
wand
her
hand
her
whole
body
shaking
with
sobs
Sprawled
the
dusty
old
carpet
patch
moonlight
clearly
dead
was
Ron
All
the
air
seemed
vanish
from
Harry
lungs
felt
though
were
falling
through
the
floor
his
brain
turned
icy
cold
Ron
dead
couldn
But
wait

Ron

Mrs

and
empty
Mrs

she
sobbed
again
Crack

Harry
staring
down
his
own
dead
body
the
floor
Let

What
going
Lupin
had
come
running
into
the
room
closely
followed
Sirius
with
Moody
stumping
along
behind
them
Lupin
looked
from
Mrs
Weasley
the
dead
Harry
the
floor
and
seemed
understand
instant
Pulling
out
his
own
wand
said
very
firmly
and
clearly
Riddikulus
Harry
body
vanished
silvery
orb
hung
the
air
over
the
spot
where
had
lain
Lupin
waved
his
wand
once
more
and
the
orb
vanished
puff
smoke
gulped
Mrs
Weasley
and
she
broke
into
storm
crying
her
face
her
hands
Molly
said
Lupin
bleakly
walking
over
her
Molly
don
Next
second
she
was
sobbing
her
heart
out
Lupin
shoulder
Molly
was
just
Boggart
said
soothingly
patting
her
the
head
just
stupid
Boggart
see
them
dead
all
the
time
Mrs
Weasley
moaned
into
his
shoulder
All
the
time
dream
about
Sirius
was
staring
the
patch
carpet
where
the
Boggart
pretending
Harry
body
had
lain
Moody
was
looking
Harry
who
avoided
his
gaze
had
funny
feeling
Moody
magical
eye
had
followed
him
all
the
way
out
the
kitchen
don
tell
Arthur
Mrs
Weasley
was
gulping
now
mopping
her
eyes
frantically
with
her
cuffs
don
want
him
know
being
silly
Lupin
handed
her
handkerchief
and
she
blew
her
nose
Harry
sorry
What
must
you
think
she
said
shakily
Not
even
able
get
rid
Boggart
Don
stupid
said
Harry
trying
smile
just
worried
she
said
tears
spilling
out
her
eyes
again
Half
the
family
the
Order
miracle
all
come
through
this
and
Percy
not
talking
what
something
dreadful
happens
and
never
made
with
him
And
what
going
happen
Arthur
and
get
killed
who
going
look
after
Ron
and
Ginny
Molly
that
enough
said
Lupin
firmly
This
isn
like
last
time
The
Order
are
better
prepared
got
head
start
know
what
Voldemort
Mrs
Weasley
gave
little
squeak
fright
the
sound
the
name
Molly
come
about
time
you
got
used
hearing
his
name
look
can
promise
one
going
get
hurt
nobody
can
promise
that
but
much
better
off
than
were
last
time
You
weren
the
Order
then
you
don
understand
Last
time
were
outnumbered
twenty
one
the
Death
Eaters
and
they
were
picking
off
one
one
Harry
thought
the
photograph
again
his
parents
beaming
faces
knew
Moody
was
still
watching
him
Don
worry
about
Percy
said
Sirius
abruptly
come
round
only
matter
time
before
Voldemort
moves
into
the
open
once
does
the
whole
Ministry
going
begging
forgive
them
And
not
sure
accepting
their
apology
added
bitterly
And
for
who
going
look
after
Ron
and
Ginny
you
and
Arthur
died
said
Lupin
smiling
slightly
what
you
think
let
them
starve
Mrs
Weasley
smiled
tremulously
Being
silly
she
muttered
again
mopping
her
eyes
But
Harry
closing
his
bedroom
door
behind
him
some
ten
minutes
later
could
not
think
Mrs
Weasley
silly
could
still
see
his
parents
beaming
him
from
the
tattered
old
photograph
unaware
that
their
lives
like
many
those
around
them
were
drawing
close
The
image
the
Boggart
posing
the
corpse
each
member
Mrs
Weasley
family
turn
kept
flashing
before
his
eyes
Without
warning
the
scar
his
forehead
seared
with
pain
again
and
his
stomach
churned
horribly
Cut
out
said
firmly
rubbing
the
scar
the
pain
receded
First
sigh
madness
talking
your
own
head
said
sly
voice
from
the
empty
picture
the
wall
Harry
ignored
felt
older
than
had
ever
felt
his
life
and
seemed
extraordinary
him
that
barely
hour
ago
had
been
worried
about
joke
shop
and
who
had
got
prefect
badge
LUNA
LOVEGOOD
Harry
had
troubled
night
sleep
His
parents
wove
and
out
his
dreams
never
speaking
Mrs
Weasley
sobbed
over
Kreacher
dead
body
watched
Ron
and
Hermione
who
were
wearing
crowns
and
yet
again
Harry
found
himself
walking
down
corridor
ending
locked
door
awoke
abruptly
with
his
scar
prickling
find
Ron
already
dressed
and
talking
him
better
hurry
Mum
going
ballistic
she
says
going
miss
the
tram
There
was
lot
commotion
the
house
From
what
heard
dressed
top
speed
Harry
gathered
that
Fred
and
George
had
bewitched
their
trunks
fly
downstairs
save
the
bother
carrying
them
with
the
result
that
they
had
hurtled
straight
into
Ginny
and
knocked
her
down
two
flights
stairs
into
the
hall
Mrs
Black
and
Mrs
Weasley
were
both
screaming
the
top
their
voices
COULD
HAVE
DONE
HER
SERIOUS
INJURY
YOU
IDIOTS
FILTHY
HALF
BREEDS
BESMIRCHING
THE
HOUSE
FATHERS
Hermione
came
hurrying
into
the
room
looking
flustered
just
Harry
was
putting
his
trainers
Hedwig
was
swaying
her
shoulder
and
she
was
carrying
squirming
Crookshanks
her
arms
Mum
and
Dad
just
sent
Hedwig
back
The
owl
fluttered
obligingly
over
and
perched
top
her
cage
Are
you
ready
yet
Nearly
Ginny
all
right
Harry
asked
shoving
his
glasses
Mrs
Weasley
patched
her
said
Hermione
But
now
Mad
Eye
complaining
that

unless
Sturgis
Podmore

guard

short
Guard
said
Harry

King
Cross
with
guard
You

King
Cross

guard
Hermione
corrected
him
Why

Harry
irritably
thought
Voldemort

supposed
lying
low
are

telling
going

out
from
behind
dustbin

and
don
know
just
what
Mad

miss
the
train
WILL
YOU
LOT
GET
DOWN
HERE
NOW
PLEASE
Mrs
Weasley
bellowed
and
Hermione
jumped
though
scalded
and
hurried
out
the
room
Harry
seized
Hedwig
stuffed
her
unceremoniously
into
her
cage
and
set
off
downstairs
after
Hermione
dragging
his
trunk
Mrs
Black
portrait
was
howling
with
rage
but
nobody
was
bothering
close
the
curtains
over
her
all
the
noise
the
hall
was
bound
rouse
her
again
anyway
Harry

with
and
Tonks
shouted
Mrs
Weasley
over
the
repeated
screeches
MUDBLOODS

Harry

clambering
over
the
various
trunks
cluttering
the
hall
get
Mrs
Weasley
honestly
said
Mrs
Weasley
despairingly
Well
your
own
head
She
wrenched
open
the
front
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
weak
September
sunlight
Harry
and
the
dog
followed
her
The
door
slammed
behind
them
and
Mrs
Black
screeches
were
cut
off
instantly
Where
Tonks
Harry
said
looking
round
they
went
down
the
stone
steps
number
twelve
which
vanished
the
moment
they
reached
the
pavement
She
waiting
for
just
here
said
Mrs
Weasley
stiffly
averting
her
eyes
from
the
lolloping
black
dog
beside
Harry
old
woman
greeted
them
the
corner
She
had
tightly
curled
grey
hair
and
wore
purple
hat
shaped
like
pork
pie
Wotcher
Harry
she
said
winking
Better

Molly
she
added
checking
her
watch

Mrs
Weasley
lengthening
her
stride
but
Mad
Eye
wanted
wait
for
Sturgis
only
Arthur
could
have
got
cars
from
the
Ministry
again
but
Fudge
won
let
him
borrow
much
empty
ink
bottle
these
days
how
Muggles
can
stand
travelling
without
magic
But
the
great
black
dog
gave
joyful
bark
and
gambolled
around
them
snapping
pigeons
and
chasing
its
own
tail
Harry
couldn
help
laughing
Sirius
had
been
trapped
inside
for
very
long
time
Mrs
Weasley
pursed
her
lips
almost
Aunt
Petunia
ish
way
took
them
twenty
minutes
reach
King
Cross
foot
and
nothing
more
eventful
happened
during
that
time
than
Sirius
scaring
couple
cats
for
Harry
entertainment
Once
inside
the
station
they
lingered
casually
beside
the
barrier
between
platforms
nine
and
ten
until
the
coast
was
clear
then
each
them
leaned
against
inturn
and
fell
easily
through
platform
nine
and
three
quarters
where
the
Hogwarts
Express
stood
belching
sooty
steam
over
platform
packed
with
departing
students
and
their
families
Harry
inhaled
the
familiar
smell
and
felt
his
spirits
soar
was
really
going
back
hope
the
others
make
time
said
Mrs
Weasley
anxiously
staring
behind
her
the
wrought
iron
arch
spanning
the
platform
through
which
new
arrivals
would
come
Nice
dog
Harry
called
tall
boy
with
dreadlocks
Thanks
Lee
said
Harry
grinning
Sirius
wagged
his
tail
frantically
good
said
Mrs
Weasley
sounding
relieved
here
Alastor
with
the
luggage
look
porter
cap
pulled
low
over
his
mismatched
eyes
Moody
came
limping
through
the
archway
pushing
trolley
loaded
with
their
trunks
All
muttered
Mrs
Weasley
and
Tonks
don
think
were
followed
Seconds
later
Weasley
emerged
the
platform
with
Ron
and
Hermione
They
had
almost
unloaded
Moody
luggage
trolley
when
Fred
George
and
Ginny
turned
with
Lupin
trouble
growled
Moody
Nothing
said
Lupin
still
reporting
Sturgis
Dumbledore
said
Moody
that

second
time

Getting

Mundungus
Well

said
Lupin
shaking
hands
all
round
reached
Harry
last
and
gave
him
clap
the
shoulder
You

Harry
careful
Yeah

your
head

eyes

said
Moody
shaking
Harry

too
And

said
Tonks
hugging
Hermione
and
Ginny
see
you
soon
expect
warning
whistle
sounded
the
students
still
the
platform
started
hurrying
the
train
Quick

said
Mrs
Weasley
distractedly
hugging
them
random
and
catching
Harry
twice
Write
good
you
forgotten
anything
send
the
train
now
hurry
For
one
brief
moment
the
great
black
dog
reared
its
hind
legs
and
placed
its
front
paws
Harry
shoulders
but
Mrs
Weasley
shoved
Harry
away
towards
the
train
door
hissing
For
heaven
sake
act
more
like
dog
Sirius
See
you
Harry
called
out
the
open
window
the
train
began
move
while
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
waved
beside
him
The
figures
Tonks
Lupin
Moody
and
and
Mrs
Weasley
shrank
rapidly
but
the
black
dog
was
bounding
alongside
the
window
wagging
its
tail
blurred
people
the
platform
were
laughing
see
chasing
the
train
then
they
rounded
bend
and
Sirius
was
gone
shouldn
have
come
with
said
Hermione
worried
voice
lighten
said
Ron
hasn
seen

Fred
clapping
his
hands
together

stand
around
chatting
all
day
got
business
discuss
with
Lee
See
you
later
and
and
George
disappeared
down
the
corridor
the
right
The
train
was
gathering
still
more
speed
that
the
houses
outside
the
window
flashed
past
and
they
swayed
where
they
stood
Shall
and
find
compartment
then
Harry
asked
Ron
and
Hermione
exchanged
looks
said
Ron
well
Ron
and
are
supposed
into
the
prefect
carriage
Hermione
said
awkwardly
Ron
wasn
looking
Harry
seemed
have
become
intensely
interested
the
fingernails
his
left
hand
said
Harry
Right
Fine
don
think
have
stay
there
all
journey
said
Hermione
quickly
Our
letters
said
just
get
instructions
from
the
Head
Boy
and
Girl
and
then
patrol
the
corridors
from
time
time
Fine
said
Harry
again
Well
might
see
you
later
then
Yeah
definitely
said
Ron
casting
shifty
anxious
look
Harry
pain
having
down
there
rather
but
have
mean
not
enjoying
not
Percy
finished
defiantly
know
you
not
said
Harry
and
grinned
But
Hermione
and
Ron
dragged
their
trunks
Crookshanks
and
caged
Pigwidgeon
off
towards
the
engine
end
the
train
Harry
felt
odd
sense
loss
had
never
travelled
the
Hogwarts
Express
without
Ron
Come
Ginny
told
him
get
move
able
save
them
places
Right
said
Harry
picking
Hedwig
cage
one
hand
and
the
handle
his
trunk
the
other
They
struggled
off
down
the
corridor
peering
through
the
glass
panelled
doors
into
the
compartments
they
passed
which
were
already
full
Harry
could
not
help
noticing
that
lot
people
stared
back
him
with
great
interest
and
that
several
them
nudged
their
neighbours
and
pointed
him
out
After
had
met
this
behaviour
five
consecutive
carriages
remembered
that
theDaily
Prophet
had
been
telling
its
readers
all
summer
what
lying
show
off
was
wondered
dully
whether
the
people
now
staring
and
whispering
believed
the
stories
the
very
last
carriage
they
met
Neville
Longbottom
Harry
fellow
fifth
year
Gryffindor
his
round
face
shining
with
the
effort
pulling
his
trunk
along
and
maintaining
one
handed
grip
his
struggling
toad
Trevor
Harry
panted
Ginny
everywhere
full
can
find
seat
What
are
you
talking
about
said
Ginny
who
had
squeezed
past
Neville
peer
into
the
compartment
behind
him
There
room
this
one
there
only
Loony
Lovegood
here
Neville
mumbled
something
about
notwanting
disturb
anyone
Don
silly
said
Ginny
laughing
she
all
right
She
slid
the
door
open
and
pulled
her
trunk
inside
Harry
and
Neville
followed
Luna
said
Ginny
take
these
seats
The
girl
beside
the
window
looked
She
had
straggly
waist
length
dirty
blonde
hair
very
pale
eyebrows
and
protuberant
eyes
that
gave
her
permanently
surprised
look
Harry
knew
once
why
Neville
had
chosen
pass
this
compartment
The
girl
gave
off
aura
distinct
dottiness
Perhaps
was
the
fact
that
she
had
stuck
her
wand
behind
her
left
ear
for
safekeeping
that
she
had
chosen
wear
necklace
Butterbeer
corks
that
she
was
reading
magazine
upside
down
Her
eyes
ranged
over
Neville
and
came
rest
Harry
She
nodded
Thanks
said
Ginny
smiling
her
Harry
and
Neville
stowed
the
three
trunks
and
Hedwig
cage
the
luggage
rack
and
sat
down
Luna
watched
them
over
her
upside
down
magazine
which
was
calledThe
Quibbler
She
did
not
seem
need
blink
much
normal
humans
She
stared
and
stared
Harry
who
had
taken
the
seat
opposite
her
and
now
wished
hadn
Had
good
summer
Luna
Ginny
asked
Yes
said
Luna
dreamily
without
taking
her
eyes
off
Harry
Yes
was
quite
enjoyable
you
know
You
reHarry
Potter
she
added
know
said
Harry
Neville
chuckled
Luna
turned
her
pale
eyes
him
instead
And

know
who
you
are

said
Neville
hurriedly

Ginny
sharply
Neville

Lovegood

man

said
Luna
singsong
voice
She
raised
her
upside
down
magazine
high
enough
hide
her
face
and
fell
silent
Harry
and
Neville
looked
each
other
with
their
eyebrows
raised
Ginny
suppressed
giggle
The
train
rattled
onwards
speeding
them
out
into
open
country
was
odd
unsettled
sort
day
one
moment
the
carriage
was
full
sunlight
and
the
next
they
were
passing
beneath
ominously
grey
clouds
Guess
what
got
for
birthday
said
Neville
Another
Remembrall
said
Harry
remembering
the
marble
like
device
Neville
grandmother
had
sent
him
effort
improve
his
abysmal
memory
said
Neville
could
with
one
though
lost
the
old
one
ages
ago
look
this
dug
the
hand
that
was
not
keeping
firm
grip
Trevor
into
his
schoolbag
and
after
little
bit
rummaging
pulled
out
what
appeared
small
grey
cactus
pot
except
that
was
covered
with
what
looked
like
boils
rather
than
spines
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
said
proudly
Harry
stared
the
thing
was
pulsating
slightly
giving
the
rather
sinister
look
some
diseased
internal
organ
really
really
rare
said
Neville
beaming
don
know
there
one
the
greenhouse
Hogwarts
even
can
wait
show
Professor
Sprout
Great
Uncle
Algie

for
Assyria

Harry
knew
that
Neville
favourite
subject
was
Herbology
but
for
the
life
him
could
not
see
what
would
want
with
this
stunted
little
plant
Does
anything
asked
Loads
stuff
said
Neville
proudly
got
amazing
defensive
mechanism
Here
hold
Trevor
for
dumped
the
toad
into
Harry
lap
and
took
quill
from
his
schoolbag
Luna
Lovegood
popping
eyes
appeared
over
the
top
her
upside
down
magazine
again
watch
what
Neville
was
doing
Neville
held
theMimbulus
mimbletonia
his
eyes
his
tongue
between
his
teeth
chose
his
spot
and
gave
the
plant
sharp
prod
with
the
tip
his
quill
Liquid
squirted
from
every
boil
the
plant
thick
stinking
dark
green
jets
They
hit
the
ceiling
the
windows
and
spattered
Luna
Lovegood
magazine
Ginny
who
had
flung
her
arms
front
her
face
just
time
merely
looked
though
she
was
wearing
slimy
green
hat
but
Harry
whose
hands
had
been
busy
preventing
Trevor
escape
received
faceful
smelled
like
rancid
manure
Neville
whose
face
and
torso
were
also
drenched
shook
his
head
get
the
worst
out
his
eyes
sorry
gasped
haven
tried
that
before
didn
realise
would
quite
don
worry
though
Stinksap
not
poisonous
added
nervously
Harry
spat
mouthful
the
floor
that
precise
moment
the
door
their
compartment
slid
open
hello
Harry
said
nervous
voice
bad
time
Harry
wiped
the
lenses
his
glasses
with
his
Trevor
free
hand
very
pretty
girl
with
long
shiny
black
hair
was
standing
the
doorway
smiling
him
Cho
Chang
the
Seeker
the
Ravenclaw
Quidditch
team
said
Harry
blankly
said
Cho
Well
just
thought
say
hello
bye
then
Rather
pink
the
face
she
closed
the
door
and
departed
Harry
slumped
back
his
seat
and
groaned
would
have
liked
Cho
discover
him
sitting
with
group
very
cool
people
laughing
their
heads
off
joke
had
just
told
would
not
have
chosen
sitting
with
Neville
and
Loony
Lovegood
clutching
toad
and
dripping
Stinksap
Never
mind
said
Ginny
bracingly
Look
can
easily
get
rid
all
this
She
pulled
out
her
wand
Scourgify
The
Stinksap
vanished
Sorry
said
Neville
again
small
voice
Ron
and
Hermione
did
not
turn
for
nearly
hour
which
time
the
food
trolley
had
already
gone
Harry
Ginny
and
Neville
had
finished
their
pumpkin
pasties
and
were
busy
swapping
Chocolate
Frog
Cards
when
the
compartment
door
slid
open
and
they
walked
accompanied
Crookshanks
and
shrilly
hooting
Pigwidgeon
his
cage
starving
said
Ron
stowing
Pigwidgeon
next
Hedwig
grabbing
Chocolate
Frog
from
Harry
and
throwing
himself
into
the
seat
next
him
ripped
open
the
wrapper
bit
off
the
frog
head
and
leaned
back
with
his
eyes
closed
though
had
had
very
exhausting
morning
Well
there
are
two
fifth
year
prefects
from
each
house
said
Hermione
looking
thoroughly
disgruntled
she
took
her
seat
Boy
and
girl
from
each
And
guess
who
Slytherin
prefect
said
Ron
still
with
his
eyes
closed
Malfoy
replied
Harry
once
certain
his
worst
fear
would
confirmed
Course
said
Ron
bitterly
stuffing
the
rest
the
Frog
into
his
mouth
and
taking
another
And
that
completecow
Pansy
Parkinson
said
Hermione
viciously
How
she
got
prefect
when
she
thicker
than
concussed
troll
Who
are
Hufflepuff
Harry
asked
Ernie
Macmillan
and
Hannah
Abbott
said
Ron
thickly
And
Anthony
Goldstein
and
Padma
Patil
for
Ravenclaw
said
Hermione
You
went
the
Yule
Ball
with
Padma
Patil
said
vague
voice
Everyone
turned
look
Luna
Lovegood
who
was
gazing
unblinkingly
Ron
over
the
top
ofThe
Quibbler
swallowed
his
mouthful
Frog
Yeah
know
did
said
looking
mildly
surprised
She
didn
enjoy
very
much
Luna
informed
him
She
doesn
think
you
treated
her
very
well
because
you
wouldn
dance
with
her
don
think
have
minded
she
added
thoughtfully
don
like
dancing
very
much
She
retreated
behindThe
Quibbler
again
Ron
stared
the
cover
with
his
mouth
hanging
open
for
few
seconds
then
looked
around
Ginny
for
some
kind
explanation
but
Ginny
had
stuffed
her
knuckles
her
mouth
stop
herself
giggling
Ron
shook
his
head
bemused
then
checked
his
watch
supposed
patrol
the
corridors
every
often
told
Harry
and
Neville
and
can
give
out
punishments
people
are
misbehaving
can
wait
get
Crabbe
and
Goyle
for
something
You
not
supposed
abuse
your
position
Ron
said
Hermione
sharply
Yeah
right
because
Malfoy
won
abuse
all
said
Ron
sarcastically
you
going
descend
his
level
just
going
make
sure
get
his
mates
before

mine
For
heaven
sake
Ron
make
Goyle

said
Ron
happily
lowered
his
voice
Goyle
low
grunt
and
screwing
his
face
look
pained
concentration
mimed
writing
midair
must
not
look
like
baboon
backside
Everyone
laughed
but
nobody
laughed
harder
than
Luna
Lovegood
She
let
out
scream
mirth
that
caused
Hedwig
wake
and
flap
her
wings
indignantly
and
Crookshanks
leap
into
the
luggage
rack
hissing
Luna
laughed
hard
her
magazine
slipped
out
her
grasp
slid
down
her
legs
and
the
floor
That
wasfunny
Her
prominent
eyes
swam
with
tears
she
gasped
for
breath
staring
Ron
Utterly
nonplussed
looked
around
the
others
who
were
now
laughing
the
expression
Ron
face
and
the
ludicrously
prolonged
laughter
Luna
Lovegood
who
was
rocking
backwards
and
forwards
clutching
her
sides
Are
you
taking
the
mickey
said
Ron
frowning
her
Baboon
backside
she
choked
holding
her
ribs
Everyone
else
was
watching
Luna
laughing
but
Harry
glancing
the
magazine
the
floor
noticed
something
that
made
him
dive
for
Upside
down
had
been
hard
tell
what
the
picture
the
front
was
but
Harry
now
realised
was
fairly
bad
cartoon
Cornelius
Fudge
Harry
only
recognised
him
because
the
lime
green
bowler
hat
One
Fudge
hands
was
clenched
around
bag
gold
the
other
hand
was
throttling
goblin
The
cartoon
was
captioned
How
Far
Will
Fudge
Gain
Gringotts
Beneath
this
were
listed
the
titles
other
articles
inside
the
magazine
Corruption

Quidditch
League
How
the
Tornados

Taking
Control
Secrets

Sirius
Black
Villain
Victim
Can
have
look
this
Harry
asked
Luna
eagerly
She
nodded
still
gazing
Ron
breathless
with
laughter
Harry
opened
the
magazine
and
scanned
the
index
Until
this
moment
had
completely
forgotten
the
magazine
Kingsley
had
handed
Weasley
give
Sirius
but
must
have
been
this
edition
ofThe
Quibbler
found
the
page
and
turned
excitedly
the
article
This
too
was
illustrated
rather
bad
cartoon
fact
Harry
would
not
have
known
was
supposed
Sirius
hadn
been
captioned
Sirius
was
standing
pile
human
bones
with
his
wand
out
The
headline
the
article
said
SIRIUS

PAINTED
Notorious
mass
murderer
innocent

Harry
had
read
this
first
sentence
several
times
before
was
convinced
that
had
not
misunderstood
Since
when
had
Sirius
been
singing
sensation
For
fourteen
years
Sirius
Black
has
been
believed
guilty
the
mass

twelve
innocent

that

fifteen
years

him
the
moment

Harry
finished
reading
and
stared
the

Perhaps

perhaps
the

flicked
back

scathingly
before

said
Luna
her

had
suddenly
lost
its
dreamy
quality
father
the

said
Hermione
looking
embarrassed
Well
got
some
interesting
mean
quite
have
back
thank
you
said
Luna
coldly
and
leaning
forwards
she
snatched
out
Harry
hands
Riffling
through
page
fifty
seven
she
turned
resolutely
upside
down
again
and
disappeared
behind
just
the
compartment
door
opened
for
the
third
time
Harry
looked
around
had
expected
this
but
that
did
not
make
the
sight
Draco
Malfoy
smirking
him
from
between
his
cronies
Crabbe
and
Goyle
any
more
enjoyable
What
said
aggressively
before
Malfoy
could
open
his
mouth
Manners
Potter
have
give
you
detention
drawled
Malfoy
whose
sleek
blond
hair
and
pointed
chin
were
just
like
his
father
You
see
unlike
you
have
been
made
prefect
which
means
that
unlike
you
have
the
power
hand
out
punishments
Yeah
said
Harry
but
you
unlike
are
git
get
out
and
leave
alone
Ron
Hermione
Ginny
and
Neville
laughed
Malfoy
lip
curled
Tell
how
does
feel

Weasley
Potter
asked
Shut
Malfoy
said
Hermione
sharply
seem
have
touched
nerve
said
Malfoy
smirking
Well
just
watch
yourself
Potter
because
bedogging
your
footsteps
case
you
step
out
line
Get
out
said
Hermione
standing
Sniggering
Malfoy
gave
Harry
last
malicious
look
and
departed
with
Crabbe
and
Goyle
lumbering
along
his
wake
Hermione
slammed
the
compartment
door
behind
them
and
turned
look
Harry
who
knew
once
that
she
like
him
had
registered
what
Malfoy
had
said
and
been
just
unnerved
Chuck
another
Frog
said
Ron
who
had
clearly
noticed
nothing
Harry
could
not
talk
freely
front
Neville
and
Luna
exchanged
another
nervous
look
with
Hermione
then
stared
out
the
window
had
thought
Sirius
coming
with
him
the
station
was
bit
laugh
but
suddenly
seemed
reckless
not
downright
dangerous
Hermione
had
been
right
Sirius
should
not
have
come
What
Malfoy
had
noticed
the
black
dog
and
told
Draco
What
had
deduced
that
the
Weasleys
Lupin
Tonks
and
Moody
knew
where
Sirius
was
hiding
had
Malfoy
use
the
word
dogging
been
coincidence
The
weather
remained
undecided
they
travelled
further
and
further
north
Rain
spattered
the
windows
half
hearted
way
then
the
sun
put
feeble
appearance
before
clouds
drifted
over
once
more
When
darkness
fell
and
lamps
came
inside
the
carriages
Luna
rolled
upThe
Quibbler
put
carefully
away
her
bag
and
took
staring
everyone
the
compartment
instead
Harry
was
sitting
with
his
forehead
pressed
against
the
train
window
trying
get
first
distant
glimpse
Hogwarts
but
was
moonless
night
and
the
rain
streaked
window
was
grimy
better
change
said
Hermione
last
and
all
them
opened
their
trunks
with
difficulty
and
pulled
their
school
robes
She
and
Ron
pinned
their
prefect
badges
carefully
their
chests
Harry
saw
Ron
checking
his
reflection
the
black
window
last
the
train
began
slow
down
and
they
heard
the
usual
racket
and
down
everybody
scrambled
get
their
luggage
and
pets
assembled
ready
get
off
Ron
and
Hermione
were
supposed
supervise
all
this
they
disappeared
from
the
carriage
again
leaving
Harry
and
the
others
look
after
Crookshanks
and
Pigwidgeon
carry
that
owl
you
like
said
Luna
Harry
reaching
out
for
Pigwidgeon
Neville
stowed
Trevor
carefully
inside
pocket
thanks
said
Harry
handing
her
the
cage
and
hoisting
Hedwig
more
securely
into
his
arms
They
shuffled
out
the
compartment
feeling
the
first
sting
the
night
air
their
faces
they
joined
the
crowd
the
corridor
Slowly
they
moved
towards
the
doors
Harry
could
smell
the
pine
trees
that
lined
the
path
down
the
lake
stepped
down
the
platform
and
looked
around
listening
for
the
familiar
call
firs
years
over
ere
firs
years
But
did
not
come
Instead
quite
different
voice
brisk
female
one
was
calling
out
First
years
line
over
here
please
All
first
years
lantern
came
swinging
towards
Harry
and
its
light
saw
the
prominent
chin
and
severe
haircut
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
the
witch
who
had
taken
over
Hagrid
Care
Magical
Creatures
lessons
for
while
the
previous
year
Where
Hagrid
said
out
loud
don
know
said
Ginny
but
better
get
out
the
way
blocking
the
door
yeah
Harry
and
Ginny
became
separated
they
moved
off
along
the
platform
and
out
through
the
station
Jostled
the
crowd
Harry
squinted
through
the
darkness
for
glimpse
Hagrid
had
here
Harry
had
been
relying
seeing
Hagrid
again
was
one
the
things
been
looking
forward
most
But
there
was
sign
him
can
have
left
Harry
told
himself
shuffled
slowly
through
narrow
doorway
the
road
outside
with
the
rest
the
crowd
just
got
cold
something
looked
around
for
Ron
Hermione
wanting
know
what
they
thought
about
the
reappearance
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
but
neither
them
was
anywhere
near
him
allowed
himself
shunted
forwards
the
dark
rain
washed
road
outside
Hogsmeade
Station
Here
stood
the
hundred
horseless
stagecoaches
that
always
took
the
students
above
first
year
the
castle
Harry
glanced
quickly
them
turned
away
keep
lookout
for
Ron
and
Hermione
then
did
double
take
The
coaches
were
longer
horseless
There
were
creatures
standing
between
the
carriage
shafts
had
had
give
them
name
supposed
would
have
called
them
horses
though
there
was
something
reptilian
about
them
too
They
were
completely
fleshless
their
black
coats
clinging
their
skeletons
which
every
bone
was
visible
Their
heads
were
dragonish
and
their
pupil
less
eyes
white
and
staring
Wings
sprouted
from
each
wither
vast
black
leathery
wings
that
looked
though
they
ought
belong
giant
bats
Standing
still
and
quiet
the
gathering
gloom
the
creatures
looked
eerie
and
sinister
Harry
could
not
understand
why
the
coaches
were
being
pulled
these
horrible
horses
when
they
were
quite
capable
moving
along
themselves
Where
Pig
said
Ron
voice
right
behind
Harry
That
Luna
girl
was
carrying
him
said
Harry
turning
quickly
eager
consult
Ron
about
Hagrid
Where
you
reckon
Hagrid
dunno
said
Ron
sounding
worried
better
short
distance
away
Draco
Malfoy
followed
small
gang
cronies
including
Crabbe
Goyle
and
Pansy
Parkinson
was
pushing
some
timid
looking
second
years
out
the
way
that
and
his
friends
could
get
coach
themselves
Seconds
later
Hermione
emerged
panting
from
the
crowd
Malfoy
was
being
absolutely
foul
first
year
back
there
swear
going
report
him
only
had
his
badge
three
minutes
and
using
bully
people
worse
than
ever
where
Crookshanks
Ginny
got
him
said
Harry
There
she
Ginny
had
just
emerged
from
the
crowd
clutching
squirming
Crookshanks
Thanks
said
Hermione
relieving
Ginny
the
cat
Come
let
get
carriage
together
before
they
all
fill
haven
got
Pig
yet
Ron
said
but
Hermione
was
already
heading
off
towards
the
nearest
unoccupied
coach
Harry
remained
behind
with
Ron
Whatare
those
things
you
reckon
asked
Ron
nodding
the
horrible
horses
the
other
students
surged
past
them
What
things
Those
horse
Luna
appeared
holding
Pigwidgeon
cage
her
arms
the
tiny
owl
was
twittering
excitedly
usual
Here
you
are
she
said
sweet
little
owl
isn
yeah
all
right
said
Ron
gruffly
Well
come
then
let
get
what
were
you
saying
Harry
was
saying
what
are
those
horse
things
Harry
said
Ron
and
Luna
made
for
the
carriage
which
Hermione
and
Ginny
were
already
sitting
What
horse
things
The
horse
things
pulling
the
carriages
said
Harry
impatiently
They
were
after
all
about
three
feet
from
the
nearest
one
was
watching
them
with
empty
white
eyes
Ron
however
gave
Harry
perplexed
look
What
are
you
talking
about
talking
about
look
Harry
grabbed
Ron
arm
and
wheeled
him
about
that
was
face
face
with
the
winged
horse
Ron
stared
straight
for
second
then
looked
back
Harry
What
supposed
looking
the
there
between
the
shafts
Harnessed
the
coach
right
there
front
But
Ron
continued
look
bemused
strange
thought
occurred
Harry
Can
can
you
see
them
See
what
Can
you
see
what
pulling
the
carriages
Ron
looked
seriously
alarmed
now
Are
you
feeling
all
right
Harry
yeah
Harry
felt
utterly
bewildered
The
horse
was
there
front
him
gleaming
solidly
the
dim
light
issuing
from
the
station
windows
behind
them
vapour
rising
from
its
nostrils
the
chilly
night
air
Yet
unless
Ron
was
faking
and
was
very
feeble
joke
was
Ron
could
not
see
all
Shall
get
then
said
Ron
uncertainly
looking
Harry
though
worried
about
him
Yeah
said
Harry
Yeah
all
right
said
dreamy
voice
from
beside
Harry
Ron
vanished
into
the
coach
dark
interior
You
not
going
mad
anything
can
see
them
too
Can
you
said
Harry
desperately
turning
Luna
could
see
the
bat
winged
horses
reflected
her
wide
silvery
eyes
yes
said
Luna
been
able
see
them
ever
since
first
day
here
They
always
pulled
the
carriages
Don
worry
You
just
sane
Smiling
faintly
she
climbed
into
the
musty
interior
the
carriage
after
Ron
Not
altogether
reassured
Harry
followed
her
THE
SORTING
HAT
NEW
SONG
Harry
did
not
want
tell
the
others
that
and
Luna
were
having
the
same
hallucination
that
was
what
was
said
nothing
more
about
the
horses
sal
down
inside
the
carriage
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
Nevertheless
could
not
help
watching
the
silhouettes
the
horses
moving
beyond
the
window
Did
everyone
see
that
Grubbly
Plank
woman
asked
Ginny
What
she
doing
back
here
Hagrid
can
have
left
can
quite
glad
has
said
Luna
isn
very
good
teacher
Yes
said
Harry
Ron
and
Ginny
angrily
Harry
glared
Hermione
She
cleared
her
throat
and
quickly
said
Erm
yes
very
good
Well
Ravenclaw
think
bit
joke
said
Luna
unlazed
You
got
rubbish
sense
humour
then
Ron
snapped
the
wheels
below
them
creaked
into
motion
Luna
did
not
seem
perturbed
Ron
rudeness
the
contrary
she
simply
watched
him
for
while
though
were
mildly
interesting
television
programme
Rattling
and
swaying
the
carriages
moved
convoy
the
road
When
they
passed
between
the
tall
stone
pillars
topped
with
winged
boars
either
side
the
gates
the
school
grounds
Harry
leaned
forwards
try
and
see
whether
there
were
any
lights
Hagrid
cabin
the
Forbidden
Forest
but
the
grounds
were
complete
darkness
Hogwarts
Castle
however
loomed
ever
closer
towering
mass
turrets
jet
black
against
the
dark
sky
here
and
there
window
blazing
fiery
bright
above
them
The
carriages
jingled
halt
near
the
stone
steps
leading
the
oak
front
doors
and
Harry
got
out
the
carriage
first
turned
again
look
for
lit
windows
down
the
Forest
but
there
was
definitely
sign
life
within
Hagrid
cabin
Unwillingly
because
had
half
hoped
they
would
have
vanished
turned
his
eyes
instead
upon
the
strange
skeletal
creatures
standing
quietly
the
chill
night
air
their
blank
white
eyes
gleaming
Harry
had
once
before
had
the
experience
seeing
something
that
Ron
could
not
but
that
had
been
reflection
mirror
something
much
more
insubstantial
than
hundred
very
solid
looking
beasts
strong
enough
pull
fleet
carriages
Luna
was
believed
the
beasts
had
always
been
there
but
invisible
Why
then
could
Harry
suddenly
see
them
and
why
could
Ron
not
Are
you
coming
what
said
Ron
beside
him
yeah
said
Harry
quickly
and
they
joined
the
crowd
hurrying
the
stone
steps
into
the
castle
The
Entrance
Hall
was
ablaze
with
torches
and
echoing
with
footsteps
the
students
crossed
the
flagged
stone
floor
for
the
double
doors
the
right
leading
the
Great
Hall
and
the
start
term
feast
The
four
long
house
tables
the
Great
Hall
were
filling
under
the
starless
black
ceiling
which
was
just
like
the
sky
they
could
glimpse
through
the
high
windows
Candles
floated
midair
all
along
the
tables
illuminating
the
silvery
ghosts
who
were
dotted
about
the
Hall
and
the
faces
the
students
talking
eagerly
exchanging
summer
news
shouting
greetings
friends
from
other
houses
eyeing
one
another
new
haircuts
and
robes
Again
Harry
noticed
people
putting
their
heads
together
whisper
passed
gritted
his
teeth
and
tried
act
though
neither
noticed
nor
cared
Luna
drifted
away
from
them
the
Ravenclaw
table
The
moment
they
reached
Gryffindors
Ginny
was
hailed
some
fellow
fourth
years
and
left
sit
with
them
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Neville
found
seats
together
about
halfway
down
the
table
between
Nearly
Headless
Nick
the
Gryffindor
house
ghost
and
Parvati
Patil
and
Lavender
Brown
the
last
two
whom
gave
Harry
airy
overly
friendly
greetings
that
made
him
quite
sure
they
had
stopped
talking
about
him
split
second
before
had
more
important
things
worry
about
however
was
looking
over
the
students
heads
the
staff
table
that
ran
along
the
top
wall
the
Hall
not
there
Ron
and
Hermione
scanned
the
staff
table
too
though
there
was
real
need
Hagrid
size
made
him
instantly
obvious
any
lineup
can
have
left
said
Ron
sounding
slightly
anxious
course
hasn
said
Harry
firmly
You
don
think
hurt
anything
you
said
Hermione
uneasily
said
Harry
once
But
where
then
There
was
pause
then
Harry
said
very
quietly
that
Neville
Parvati
and
Lavender
could
not
hear
Maybe
not
back
yet
You
know
from
his
mission
the
thing
was
doing
over
the
summer
for
Dumbledore
Yeah
yeah
that
said
Ron
sounding
reassured
but
Hermione
bit
her
lip
looking
and
down
the
staff
table
though
hoping
for
some
conclusive
explanation
Hagrid
absence
Who
that
she
said
sharply
pointing
towards
the
middle
the
staff
table
Harry
eyes
followed
hers
They
lit
first
upon
Professor
Dumbledore
sitting
his
high
backed
golden
chair
the
centre
the
long
staff
table
wearing
deep
purple
robes
scattered
with
silvery
stars
and
matching
hat
Dumbledore
head
was
inclined
towards
the
woman
sitting
next
him
who
was
talking
into
his
ear
She
looked
Harry
thought
like
somebody
maiden
aunt
squat
with
short
curly
mouse
brown
hair
which
she
had
placed
horrible
pink
Alice
band
that
matched
the
fluffy
pink
cardigan
she
wore
over
her
robes
Then
she
turned
her
face
slightly
take
sip
from
her
goblet
and
saw
with
shock
recognition
pallid
toadlike
face
and
pair
prominent
pouchy
eyes
that
Umbridge
woman
Who
said
Hermione
She
was
hearing
she
works
for
Fudge
Nice
cardigan
said
Ron
smirking
She
works
for
Fudge
Hermione
repeated
frowning
What
earth
she
doing
here
then
Dunno
Hermione
scanned
the
staff
table
her
eyes
narrowed
she
muttered
surely
not
Harry
did
not
understand
what
she
was
talking
about
but
did
not
ask
his
attention
had
been
caught
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
who
had
just
appeared
behind
the
staff
table
she
worked
her
way
along
the
very
end
and
took
the
seat
that
ought
have
been
Hagrid
That
meant
the
first
years
must
have
crossed
the
lake
and
reached
the
castle
and
sure
enough
few
seconds
later
the
doors
from
the
Entrance
Hall
opened
long
line
scared
looking
first
years
entered
led
Professor
McGonagall
who
was
carrying
stool
which
sat
ancient
wizard
hat
heavily
patched
and
darned
with
wide
rip
near
the
frayed
brim
The
buzz
talk
the
Great
Hall
faded
away
The
first
years
lined
front
the
staff
table
facing
the
rest
the
students
and
Professor
McGonagall
placed
the
stool
carefully
front
them
then
stood
back
The
first
years
faces
glowed
palely
the
candlelight
small
boy
right
the
middle
the
row
looked
though
was
trembling
Harry
recalled
fleetingly
how
terrified
had
felt
when
had
stood
there
waiting
for
the
unknown
test
that
would
determine
which
house
belonged
The
whole
school
waited
with
bated
breath
Then
the
rip
near
the
hat
brim
opened
wide
like
mouth
and
the
Sorting
Hat
burst
into
song
times
old
when
was
newAnd
Hogwarts
barely
startedThe
founders
our
noble
schoolThought
never
parted
United
common
goal
They
had
the
selfsame
yearning
make
the
world
best
magic
schoolAnd
pass
along
their
learning
Together
will
build
and
teach
The
four
good
friends
decidedAnd
never
did
they
dream
that
theyMight
some
day
divided
For
were
there
such
friends
anywhereAs
Slytherin
and
Gryffindor
Unless
was
the
second
pairOf
Hufflepuff
and
Ravenclaw
how
could
have
gone
wrong
How
could
such
friendships
fail
Why
was
there
and
can
tellThe
whole
sad
sorry
tale
Said
Slytherin
teach
just
thoseWhose
ancestry
purest
Said
Ravenclaw
teach
those
whoseIntelligence
surest
Said
Gryffindor
teach
all
thoseWith
brave
deeds
their
name
Said
Hufflepuff
teach
the
lot
And
treat
them
just
the
same
These
differences
caused
little
strifeWhen
first
they
came
light
For
each
the
four
founders
hadA
house
which
they
mightTake
only
those
they
wanted
For
instance
SlytherinTook
only
pure
blood
wizardsOf
great
cunning
just
like
him
And
only
those
sharpest
mindWere
taught
RavenclawWhile
the
bravest
and
the
boldestWent
daring
Gryffindor
Good
Hufflepuff
she
took
the
rest
And
taught
them
all
she
knew
Thus
the
houses
and
their
foundersRetained
friendships
firm
and
true
Hogwarts
worked
harmonyFor
several
happy
years
But
then
discord
crept
among
usFeeding
our
faults
and
fears
The
houses
that
like
pillars
four
Had
once
held
our
school
Now
turned
upon
each
other
and
Divided
sought
rule
And
for
while
seemed
the
schoolMust
meet
early
end
What
with
duelling
and
with
jightingAnd
the
clash
friend
friendAnd
last
there
came
morningWhen
old
Slytherin
departedAnd
though
the
fighting
then
died
outHe
left
quite
downhearted
And
never
since
the
founders
fourWere
whittled
down
threeHave
the
houses
been
unitedAs
they
once
were
meant
And
now
the
Sorting
Hat
hereAnd
you
all

that

Listen

Though

have

Let
the
Sorting
now
begin
The
Hat
became
motionless
once
more
applause
broke
out
though
was
punctured
for
the
first
time
Harry
memory
with
muttering
and
whispers
All
across
the
Great
Hall
students
were
exchanging
remarks
with
their
neighbours
and
Harry
clapping
along
with
everyone
else
knew
exactly
what
they
were
talking
about
Branched
out
bit
this
year
hasn
said
Ron
his
eyebrows
raised
Too
right
has
said
Harry
The
Sorting
Hat
usually
confined
itself
describing
the
different
qualities
looked
for
each
the
four
Hogwarts
houses
and
its
own
role
Sorting
them
Harry
could
not
remember
ever
trying
give
the
school
advice
before
wonder
ever
given
warnings
before
said
Hermione
sounding
slightly
anxious
Yes
indeed
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
knowledgeably
leaning
across
Neville
towards
her
Neville
winced
was
very
uncomfortable
have
ghost
lean
through
you
The
Hat
feels
itself
honour
bound
give
the
school
due
warning
whenever
feels
But
Professor
McGonagall
who
was
waiting
read
out
the
list
first
years
names
was
giving
the
whispering
students
the
sort
look
that
scorches
Nearly
Headless
Nick
placed
see
through
finger
his
lips
and
sat
primly
upright
again
the
muttering
came
abrupt
end
With
last
frowning
look
that
swept
the
four
house
tables
Professor
McGonagall
lowered
her
eyes
her
long
piece
parchment
and
called
out
the
first
name
Abercrombie
Euan
The
terrified
looking
boy
Harry
had
noticed
earlier
stumbled
forwards
and
put
the
Hat
his
head
was
only
prevented
from
falling
right
down
his
shoulders
his
very
prominent
ears
The
Hat
considered
for
moment
then
the
rip
near
the
brim
opened
again
and
shouted
Gryffindor
Harry
clapped
loudly
with
the
rest
Gryffindor
house
Euan
Abercrombie
staggered
their
table
and
sat
down
looking
though
would
like
very
much
sink
through
the
floor
and
never
looked
again
Slowly
the
long
line
first
years
thinned
the
pauses
between
the
names
and
the
Sorting
Hat
decisions
Harry
could
hear
Ron
stomach
rumbling
loudly
Finally
Zeller
Rose
was
Sorted
into
Hufflepuff
and
Professor
McGonagall
picked
the
Hat
and
stool
and
marched
them
away
Professor
Dumbledore
rose
his
feet
Whatever
his
recent
bitter
feelings
had
been
towards
his
Headmaster
Harry
was
somehow
soothed
see
Dumbledore
standing
before
them
all
Between
the
absence
Hagrid
and
the
presence
those
dragonish
horses
had
felt
that
his
return
Hogwarts
long
anticipated
was
full
unexpected
surprises
like
jarring
notes
familiar
song
But
this
least
was
how
was
supposed
their
Headmaster
rising
greet
them
all
before
the
start
term
feast
our
newcomers
said
Dumbledore
ringing
voice
his
arms
stretched
wide
and
beaming
smile
his
lips
welcome
our
old
hands
welcome
back
There
time
for
speech
making
but
this
not
Tuck
There
was
appreciative
laugh
and
outbreak
applause
Dumbledore
sat
down
neatly
and
threw
his
long
beard
over
his
shoulder
keep
out
the
way
his
plate
for
food
had
appeared
out
nowhere
that
the
five
long
tables
were
groaning
under
joints
and
pies
and
dishes
vegetables
bread
and
sauces
and
flagons
pumpkin
juice
Excellent
said
Ron
with
kind
groan
longing
and
seized
the
nearest
plate
chops
and
began
piling
them
his
plate
watched
wistfully
Nearly
Headless
Nick
What
were
you
saying
before
the
Sorting
Hermione
asked
the
ghost
About
the
Hat
giving
warnings
yes
said
Nick
who
seemed
glad
reason
turn
away
from
Ron
who
was
now
eating
roast
potatoes
with
almost
indecent
enthusiasm
Yes
have
heard
the
Hat
give
several
warnings
before
always
times
when
detects
periods
great
danger
for
the
school
And
always
course
its
advice
the
same

Ron
His

was

Harry

for
him

any
noise
all

your
pardon
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
politely
while
Hermione
looked
revolted
Ron
gave
enormous
swallow
and
said
How
can
know
the
school

said
Nearly
Headless
Nick

Dumbledore

And

said
Harry
looking
over
the
Slytherin
table
where
Draco
Malfoy
was
holding
court
Fat
chance
Well
now
you
shouldn
take
that
attitude
said
Nick
reprovingly
Peaceful
operation
that
the
key
ghosts
though
belong
separate
houses
maintain
links
friendship
spite
the
competitiveness
between
Gryffindor
and
Slytherin
would
never
dream
seeking
argument
with
the
Bloody
Baron
Only
because
you
terrified
him
said
Ron
Nearly
Headless
Nick
looked
highly
affronted
Terrified

The

What
blood
asked
Ron
Surely
you
haven
still
got

said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
now
annoyed
his
head
was
trembling
ominously
his
partially
severed
neck
assume
still
allowed

the
use
whichever
words
like
even
the
pleasures
eating
and
drinking
are
denied
But
quite
used
students
poking
fun
death
assure
you
Nick
wasn
really
laughing
you
said
Hermione
throwing
furious
look
Ron
Unfortunately
Ron
mouth
was
packed
exploding
point
again
and
all
could
manage
was
Node
iddum
eentup
sechew
which
Nick
did
not
seem
think
constituted
adequate
apology
Rising
into
the
air
straightened
his
feathered
hat
and
swept
away
from
them
the
other
end
the
table
coming
rest
between
the
Creevey
brothers
Colin
and
Dennis
Well
done
Ron
snapped
Hermione
What
said
Ron
indignantly
having
managed
finally
swallow
his
tood
not
allowed
ask
simple
question
forget
said
Hermione
irritably
and
the
pair
them
spent
the
rest
the
meal
huffy
silence
Harry
was
too
used
their
bickering
bother
trying
reconcile
them
felt
was
better
use
his
time
eat
his
way
steadily
through
his
steak
and
kidney
pie
then
large
plateful
his
favourite
treacle
tart
When
all
the
students
had
finished
eating
and
the
noise
level
the
Hall
was
starting
creep
upwards
again
Dumbledore
got
his
feet
once
more
Talking
ceased
immediately
all
turned
face
the
Headmaster
Harry
was
feeling
pleasantly
drowsy
now
His
four
poster
bed
was
waiting
somewhere
above
wonderfully
warm
and
soft
Well
now
that
are
all
digesting
another
magnificent
feast
beg
few
moments
your
attention
for
the
usual
start
term
notices
said
Dumbledore
First

know
that
the
Forest

bounds
students
and
few
our
older
students
ought
know
now
too
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
exchanged
smirks

also
delighted
introduce
Professor
Umbridge
our
new
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
There
was
round
polite
but
fairly
unenthusiastic
applause
during
which
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
exchanged
slightly
panicked
looks
Dumbledore
had
not
said
for
how
long
Grubbly
Plank
would
teaching
Dumbledore
continued
Tryouts
for
the
house
Quidditch
teams
will
take
place
the
broke
off
looking
enquiringly
Professor
Umbridge
she
was
not
much
taller
standing
than
sitting
there
was
moment
when
nobody
understood
why
Dumbledore
had
stopped
talking
but
then
Professor
Umbridge
cleared
her
throat
Hem
hem
and
became
clear
that
she
had
got
her
feet
and
was
intending
make
speech
Dumbledore
only
looked
taken
aback
for
moment
then
sat
down
smartly
and
looked
alertly
Professor
Umbridge
though
desired
nothing
better
than
listen
her
talk
Other
members
staff
were
not
adept
hiding
their
surprise
Professor
Sprout
eyebrows
had
disappeared
into
her
flyaway
hair
and
Professor
McGonagall
mouth
was
thin
Harry
had
ever
seen
new
teacher
had
ever
interrupted
Dumbledore
before
Many
the
students
were
smirking
this
woman
obviously
did
not
know
how
things
were
done
Hogwarts
Thank
you
Headmaster
Professor
Umbridge
simpered
for
those
kind
words
welcome
Her
voice
was
high
pitched
breathy
and
little
girlish
and
again
Harry
felt
powerful
rush
dislike
that
could
not
explain
himself
all
knew
was
that
loathed
everything
about
her
from
her
stupid
voice
her
fluffy
pink
cardigan
She
gave
another
little
throat
clearing
cough
hem
hem
and
continued
Well
lovely
back
Hogwarts
must
say
She
smiled
revealing
very
pointed
teeth
And
see
such
happy
little
faces
looking
Harry
glanced
around
None
the
faces
could
see
looked
happy
the
contrary
they
all
looked
rather
taken
aback
being
addressed
though
they
were
five
years
old
very
much
looking
forward
getting
know
you
all
and
sure
very
good
friends
Students
exchanged
looks
this
some
them
were
barely
concealing
grins
her
friend
long
don
have
borrow
that
cardigan
Parvati
whispered
Lavender
and
both
them
lapsed
into
silent
giggles
Professor
Umbridge
cleared
her
throat
again
hem
hem
but
when
she
continued
some
the
breathiness
had
vanished
from
her
voice
She
sounded
much
more
businesslike
and
now
her
words
had
dull
learned
heart
sound
them
The
Ministry
Magic
has
always
considered
the
education
young
witches
and
wizards
vital
importance
The
rare
gifts
with
which
you
were
born
may
come
nothing
not
nurtured
and
honed
careful
instruction
The
ancient
skills
unique
the
wizarding
community
must
passed
downthe
generations
lest
lose
them
for
ever
The
treasure
trove
magical
knowledge
amassed
our
ancestors
must
guarded
replenished
and
polished
those
who
have
been
called
the
noble
profession
teaching
Professor
Umbridge
paused
here
and
made
little
bow
her
fellow
staff
members
none
whom
bowed
back
her
Professor
McGonagall
dark
eyebrows
had
contracted
that
she
looked
positively
hawklike
and
Harry
distinctly
saw
her
exchange
significant
glance
with
Professor
Sprout
Umbridge
gave
another
little
hem
hem
and
went
with
her
speech
Every
headmaster
and
headmistress
Hogwarts
has
brought
something
new
the
weighty
task
governing
this
historic
school
and
that
should
for
without
progress
there
will
stagnation
and
decay
There
again
progress
for
progress
sake
must
discouraged
for
our
tried
and
tested
traditions
often
require
tinkering
balance
then
between
old
and
new
between
permanence
and
change
between
tradition
and
innovation
Harry
lound
his
attentiveness
ebbing
though
his
brain
was
slipping
and
out
tune
The
quiet
that
always
filled
the
Hall
when
Dumbledore
was
speaking
was
breaking
students
put
their
heads
together
whispering
and
giggling
Over
the
Ravenclaw
table
Cho
Chang
was
chatting
animatedly
with
her
friends
few
seats
along
from
Cho
Luna
Lovegood
had
got
outThe
Quibbler
again
Meanwhile
the
Hufflepuff
table
Ernie
Macmillan
was
one
the
few
still
staring
Professor
Umbridge
but
was
glassy
eyed
and
Harry
was
sure
was
only
pretending
listen
attempt
live
the
new
prefect
badge
gleaming
his
chest
Professor
Umbridge
did
not
seem
notice
the
restlessness
her
audience
Harry
had
the
impression
that
full
scale
riot
could
have
broken
out
under
her
nose
and
she
would
have
ploughed
with
her
speech
The
teachers
however
were
still
listening
very
attentively
and
Hermione
seemed
drinking
every
word
Umbridge
spoke
though
judging
her
expression
they
were
not
all
her
taste
because
some
changes
will
for
the
better
while
others
will
come
the
fullness
time
recognised
errors
judgement
Meanwhile
some
old
habits
will
retained
and
rightly
whereas
others
outmoded
and
outworn
must
abandoned
Let
move
forward
then
into
new
era
openness
effectiveness
and
accountability
intent
preserving
what
ought
preserved
perfecting
what
needs
perfected
and
pruning
wherever
find
practices
that
ought
prohibited
She
sat
down
Dumbledore
clapped
The
staff
followed
his
lead
though
Harry
noticed
that
several
them
brought
their
hands
together
only
once
twice
before
stopping
few
students
joined
but
most
had
been
taken
unawares
the
end
the
speech
not
having
listened
more
than
few
words
and
before
they
could
start
applauding
properly
Dumbledore
had
stood
again
Thank
you
very
much
Professor
Umbridge
that
was
most
illuminating
said
bowing
her
Now
was
saying
Quidditch
tryouts
will
held
Yes
certainly
was
illuminating
said
Hermione
low
voice
You
not
telling
you
enjoyed
Ron
said
quietly
turning
glazed
face
towards
Hermione
That
was
about
the
dullest
speech
ever
heard
and
grew
with
Percy
said
illuminating
not
enjoyable
said
Hermione
explained
lot
Did
said
Harry
surprise
Sounded
like
load
waffle
There
was
some
important
stuff
hidden
the
waffle
said
Hermione
grimly
Was
there
said
Ron
blankly
How
about
progress
for
progress
sake
must
discouraged
How
about
pruning
wherever
find
practices
that
ought
prohibited
Well
what
does
that
mean
said
Ron
impatiently
tell
you
what
means
said
Hermione
through
gritted
teeth
means
the
Ministry
interfering
Hogwarts
There
was
great
clattering
and
banging
all
around
them
Dumbledore
had
obviously
just
dismissed
the
school
because
everyone
was
standing
ready
leave
the
Hall
Hermione
jumped
looking
flustered
Ron
supposed
show
the
first
years
where
yeah
said
Ron
who
had
obviously
forgotten
Hey
hey
you
lot
Midgets
Ron
Well
they
are
they
titchy
know
but

First

called
commandingly
along
the
table
This
way
please
group
new
students
walked
shyly
the
gap
between
the
Gryffindor
and
Hufflepuff
tables
all
them
trying
hard
not
lead
the
group
They
did
indeed
seem
very
small
Harry
was
sure
had
not
appeared
that
young
when
had
arrived
here
grinned
them
blond
boy
next
Euan
Abercrombie
looked
petrified
nudged
Euan
and
whispered
something
his
ear
Euan
Abercrombie
looked
equally
frightened
and
stole
horrified
look
Harry
who
felt
the
grin
slide
off
his
face
like
Stinksap
See
you
later
said
dully
Ron
and
Hermione
and
made
his
way
out
the
Great
Hall
alone
doing
everything
could
ignore
more
whispering
staring
and
pointing
passed
kept
his
eyes
fixed
ahead
wove
his
way
through
the
crowd
the
Entrance
Hall
then
hurried
the
marble
staircase
took
couple
concealed
short
cuts
and
had
soon
left
most
the
crowds
behind
had
been
stupid
not
expect
this
thought
angrily
walked
through
the
much
emptier
upstairs
corridors
course
everyone
was
staring
him
had
emerged
from
the
Triwizard
maze
two
months
previously
clutching
the
dead
body
fellow
student
and
claiming
have
seen
Lord
Voldemort
return
power
There
had
not
been
time
last
term
explain
himself
before
they
all
had
home
even
had
felt
giving
the
whole
school
detailed
account
the
terrible
events
that
graveyard
Harry
had
reached
the
end
the
corridor
the
Gryffindor
common
room
and
come
halt
front
the
portrait
the
Fat
Lady
before
realised
that
did
not
know
the
new
password
said
glumly
staring
the
Fat
Lady
who
smoothed
the
folds
her
pink
satin
dress
and
looked
sternly
back
him
password
entrance
she
said
loftily
Harry
know
Someone
panted
behind
him
and
turned
see
Neville
jogging
towards
him
Guess
what
actually
going
able
remember
for
once
waved
the
stunted
little
cactus
had
shown
them
the
train
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
Correct
said
the
Fat
Lady
and
her
portrait
swung
open
towards
them
like
door
revealing
circular
hole
the
wall
behind
through
which
Harry
and
Neville
now
climbed
The
Gryffindor
common
room
looked
welcoming
ever
cosy
circular
tower
room
full
dilapidated
squashy
armchairs
and
rickety
old
tables
fire
was
crackling
merrily
the
grate
and
few
people
were
warming
their
hands
before
going
their
dormitories
the
other
side
the
room
Fred
and
George
Weasley
were
pinning
something
the
noticeboard
Harry
waved
goodnight
them
and
headed
straight
for
the
door
the
boys
dormitories
was
not
much
mood
for
talking
the
moment
Neville
followed
him
Dean
Thomas
and
Seamus
Finnigan
had
reached
the
dormitory
first
and
were
the
process
covering
the
walls
beside
their
beds
with
posters
and
photographs
They
had
been
talking
Harry
pushed
open
the
door
but
stopped
abruptly
the
moment
they
saw
him
Harry
wondered
whether
they
had
been
talking
about
him
then
whether
was
being
paranoid
said
moving
across
his
own
trunk
and
opening
Hey
Harry
said
Dean
who
was
putting
pair
pyjamas
the
West
Ham
colours
Good
holiday
Not
bad
muttered
Harry
true
account
his
holiday
would
have
taken
most
the
night
relate
and
could
not
face
You
Yeah
was
chuckled
Dean
Better
than
Seamus
anyway
was
just
telling
Why
what
happened
Seamus
Neville
asked
placed
his
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
tenderly
his
bedside
cabinet
Seamus
did
not
answer
immediately
was
making
rather
meal
ensuring
that
his
poster
the
Kenmare
Kestrels
Quidditch
team
was
quite
straight
Then
said
with
his
back
still
turned
Harry
mum
didn
want
come
back
What
said
Harry
pausing
the
act
pulling
off
his
robes
She
didn
want
come
back
Hogwarts
Seamus
turned
away
from
his
poster
and
pulled
his
own
pyjamas
out
his
trunk
still
not
looking
Harry
But
why
said
Harry
astonished
knew
that
Seamus
mother
was
witch
and
could
not
understand
therefore
why
she
should
have
come
over
Dursleyish
Seamus
did
not
answer
until
had
finished
buttoning
his
pyjamas
Well
said
measured
voice
suppose
because
you
What
you
mean
said
Harry
quickly
His
heart
was
beating
rather
fast
felt
vaguely
though
something
was
closing
him
Well
said
Seamus
again
still
avoiding
Harry
eye
she
well
not
just
you
Dumbledore
too
She
believes
theDaily
Prophet
said
Harry
She
thinks
liar
and
Dumbledore
old
fool
Seamus
looked
him
Yeah
something
like
that
Harry
said
nothing
threw
his
wand
down
his
bedside
table
pulled
off
his
robes
stuffed
them
angrily
into
his
trunk
and
pulled
his
pyjamas
was
sick
sick
being
the
person
who
stared
and
talked
about
all
the
time
any
them
knew
any
them
had
the
faintest
idea
what
felt
like
the
one
all
these
things
had
happened
Mrs
Finnigan
had
idea
the
stupid
woman
thought
savagely
got
into
bed
and
made
pull
the
hangings
closed
around
him
but
before
could
Seamus
said
Look
whatdid
happen
that
night
when
you
know
when
with
Cedric
Diggory
and
all
Seamus
sounded
nervous
and
eager
the
same
time
Dean
who
had
been
bending
over
his
trunk
trying
retrieve
slipper
went
oddly
still
and
Harry
knew
was
listening
hard
What
are
you
asking
for
Harry
retorted
Just
read
theDaily
Prophet
like
your
mother
why
don
you
That
tell
you
all
you
need
know
Don
you
have
mother
Seamus
snapped
have
anyone
who
calls
liar
said
Harry
Don
talk
like
that
talk
you
how
want
said
Harry
his
temper
rising
fast
snatched
his
wand
back
from
his
bedside
table
you
got
problem
sharing
dormitory
with
and
ask
McGonagall
you
can
moved
stop
your
mummy
worrying
Leave
mother
out
this
Potter
What
going
Ron
had
appeared
the
doorway
His
wide
eyes
travelled
from
Harry
who
was
kneeling
his
bed
with
his
wand
pointing
Seamus
Seamus
who
was
standing
there
with
his
fists
raised
having
mother
Seamus
yelled
What
said
Ron
Harry
wouldn
that
met
your
mother
liked
her
That
before
she
started
believing
every
word
the
stinkingDaily
Prophet
writes
about
said
Harry
the
top
his
voice
said
Ron
comprehension
dawning
across
his
freckled
face
right
You
know
what
said
Seamus
heatedly
casting
Harry
venomous
look
right
don
want
share
dormitory
with
him
any
more
mad
That
out
order
Seamus
said
Ron
whose
ears
were
starting
glow
red
always
danger
sign
Out
order
shouted
Seamus
who
contrast
with
Ron
was
going
pale
You
believe
all
the
rubbish
come
out
with
about
You
Know
Who
you
you
reckon
telling
the
truth
Yeah
said
Ron
angrily
Then
you
mad
too
said
Seamus
disgust
Yeah
Well
unfortunately
for
you
pal
also
prefect
said
Ron
jabbing
himself
the
chest
with
finger
unless
you
want
detention
watch
your
mouth
Seamus
looked
for
few
seconds
though
detention
would
reasonable
price
pay
say
what
was
going
through
his
mind
but
with
noise
contempt
turned
his
heel
vaulted
into
bed
and
pulled
the
hangings
shut
with
such
violence
that
they
were
ripped
from
the
bed
and
fell
dusty
pile
the
floor
Ron
glared
Seamus
then
looked
Dean
and
Neville
Anyone
else
parents
got
problem
with
Harry
said
aggressively
parents
are
Muggles
mate
said
Dean
shrugging
They
don
know
nothing
about
deaths
Hogwarts
because
not
stupid
enough
tell
them
You
don
know
mother
she
weasel
anything
out

Seamus
snapped
him
Anyway
your
parents
don
get
theDaily
Prophet
They
don
know
our
Headmaster
been
sacked
from
the
Wizengamot
and
the
International
Confederation
Wizards
because
losing
his
marbles
gran
says
that
rubbish
piped
Neville
She
says
theDaily
Prophet
that
going
downhill
not
Dumbledore
She
cancelled
our
subscription
believe
Harry
said
Neville
simply
climbed
into
bed
and
pulled
the
covers
his
chin
looking
owlishly
over
them
Seamus
gran
always
said
You
Know
Who
would
come
back
one
day
She
says
Dumbledore
says
back
back
Harry
felt
rush
gratitude
towards
Neville
Nobody
else
said
anything
Seamus
got
out
his
wand
repaired
the
bed
hangings
and
vanished
behind
them
Dean
got
into
bed
rolled
over
and
fell
silent
Neville
who
appeared
have
nothing
more
say
either
was
gazing
fondly
his
moonlit
cactus
Harry
lay
back
his
pillows
while
Ron
bustled
around
the
next
bed
putting
his
things
away
felt
shaken
the
argument
with
Seamus
whom
had
always
liked
very
much
How
many
more
people
were
going
suggest
that
was
lying
unhinged
Had
Dumbledore
suffered
like
this
all
summer
first
the
Wizengamot
then
the
International
Confederation
Wizards
had
thrown
him
from
their
ranks
Was
anger
Harry
perhaps
that
had
stopped
Dumbledore
getting
touch
with
him
for
months
The
two
them
were
this
together
after
all
Dumbledore
had
believed
Harry
announced
his
version
events
the
whole
school
and
then
the
wider
wizarding
community
Anyone
who
thought
Harry
was
liar
had
think
that
Dumbledore
was
too
else
that
Dumbledore
had
been
hoodwinked
They
know
right
the
end
thought
Harry
miserably
Ron
got
into
bed
and
extinguished
the
last
candle
the
dormitory
But
wondered
how
many
more
attacks
like
Seamus
would
have
endure
before
that
time
came
PROFESSOR
UMBRIDGE
Seamus
dressed
top
speed
next
morning
and
left
the
dormitory
before
Harry
had
even
put
his
socks
Does
think
turn
into
nutter
stays
room
with
too
long
asked
Harry
loudly
the
hem
Seamus
robes
whipped
out
sight
Don
worry
about
Harry
Dean
muttered
hoisting
his
schoolbag
his
shoulder
just
But
apparently
was
unable
say
exactly
what
Seamus
was
and
after
slightly
awkward
pause
followed
him
out
the
room
Neville
and
Ron
both
gave
Harry
his
problem
not
yours
look
but
Harry
was
not
much
consoled
How
much
more
this
would
have
take
What
the
matter
asked
Hermione
five
minutes
later
catching
with
Harry
and
Ron
halfway
across
the
common
room
they
all
headed
towards
breakfast
You
look
absolutely
for
heaven
sake
She
was
staring
the
common
room
noticeboard
where
large
new
sign
had
been
put
GALLONS
GALLEONS
Pocket
money
failing
keep
pace
with

Like

Contact
Fred
and
George
Weasley
Gryffindor
common
room
for
simple
part
time
virtually
painless
jobs
regret
that
all
work
undertaken
applicant
own
risk
They
are
the
limit
said
Hermione
grimly
taking
down
the
sign
which
Fred
and
George
had
pinned
over
poster
giving
the
date
the
first
Hogsmeade
weekend
which
was
October
have
talk
them
Ron
Ron
looked
positively
alarmed
Why
Because
prefects
said
Hermione
they
climbed
out
through
the
portrait
hole
stop
this
kind
thing
Ron
said
nothing
Harry
could
tell
from
his
glum
expression
that
the
prospect
stopping
Fred
and
George
doing
exactly
what
they
liked
was
not
one
found
inviting
Anyway
what
Harry
Hermione
continued
they
walked
down
flight
stairs
lined
with
portraits
old
witches
and
wizards
all
whom
ignored
them
being
engrossed
their
own
conversation
You
look
really
angry
about
something
Seamus
reckons
Harry
lying
about
You
Know
Who
said
Ron
succinctly
when
Harry
did
not
respond
Hermione
who
Harry
had
expected
react
angrily
his
behalf
sighed
Yes
Lavender
thinks
too
she
said
gloomily
Been
having
nice
little
chat
with
her
about
whether
not
lying
attention
seeking
prat
have
you
Harry
said
loudly
said
Hermione
calmly
told
her
keep
her
big
fat
mouth
shut
about
you
actually
And
would
quite
nice
you
stopped
jumping
down
our
throats
Harry
because
case
you
haven
noticed
Ron
and
are
your
side
There
was
short
pause
Sorry
said
Harry
low
voice
That
quite
all
right
said
Hermione
with
dignity
Then
she
shook
her
head
Don
you
remember
what
Dumbledore
said
the
last
end
term
feast
Harry
and
Ron
both
looked
her
blankly
and
Hermione
sighed
again
About
You
Know
Who
said
his
gift
for
spreading
discord
and
enmity
very
great
can
fight
only
showing
equally
strong
bond
friendship
and
trust
How
you
remember
stuff
like
that
asked
Ron
looking
her
admiration
listen
Ron
said
Hermione
with
touch
asperity
but
still
couldn
tell
you
exactly
what
The
point
Hermione
pressed
loudly
that
this
sort
thing
exactly
what
Dumbledore
was
talking
about
You
Know
Who
only
been
back
two
months
and
already
started
fighting
among
ourselves
And
the
Sorting
Hat
warning
was
the
same
stand
together
united
And
Harry
got
right
last
night
retorted
Ron
that
means
supposed
get
matey
with
the
Slytherins
fat
chance
Well
think
pity
not
trying
for
bit
inter
house
unity
said
Hermione
crossly
They
had
reached
the
foot
the
marble
staircase
line
fourth
year
Ravenclaws
was
crossing
the
Entrance
Hall
they
caught
sight
Harry
and
hurried
form
tighter
group
though
frightened
might
attack
stragglers
Yeah
really
ought
trying
make
friends
with
people
like
that
said
Harry
sarcastically
They
followed
the
Ravenclaws
into
the
Great
Hall
all
looking
instinctively
the
staff
table
they
entered
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
was
chatting
Professor
Sinistra
the
Astronomy
teacher
and
Hagrid
was
once
again
conspicuous
only
his
absence
The
enchanted
ceiling
above
them
echoed
Harry
mood
was
miserable
rain
cloud
grey
Dumbledore
didn
even
mention
how
long
that
Grubbly
Plank
woman
staying
said
they
made
their
way
across
the
Gryffindor
table
Maybe
said
Hermione
thoughtfully
What
said
both
Harry
and
Ron
together
Well
maybe
didn
want
draw
attention
Hagrid
not
being
here
What
you
mean
draw
attention
said
Ron
half
laughing
How
could
not
notice
Before
Hermione
could
answer
tall
black
girl
with
long
braided
hair
had
marched
Harry
Angelina
she
said
briskly
good
summer
And
without
waiting
for
answer
Listen
been
made
Gryffindor
Quidditch
Captain
Nice
one
said
Harry
grinning
her
suspected
Angelina
pep
talks
might
not
long
winded
Oliver
Wood
had
been
which
could
only
improvement
Yeah

Keeper
now
Oliver
left
Tryouts

Friday

clock
and

whole
team

Then

see
how
the
new
person

said
Harry
Angelina
smiled
him
and
departed
forgotten
Wood
had
left
said
Hermione
vaguely
she
sat
down
beside
Ron
and
pulled
plate
toast
towards
her
suppose
that
will
make
quite
difference
the
team
pose
said
Harry
taking
the
bench
opposite
was
good
Keeper
Still
won
hurt
have
some
new
blood
will
said
Ron
With
whoosh
and
clatter
hundreds
owls
came
soaring
through
the
upper
windows
They
descended
all
over
the
Hall
bringing
letters
and
packages
their
owners
and
showering
the
breakfasters
with
droplets
water
was
clearly
raining
hard
outside
Hedwig
was
nowhere
seen
but
Harry
was
hardly
surprised
his
only
correspondent
was
Sirius
and
doubted
Sirius
would
have
anything
new
tell
him
after
only
twenty
four
hours
apart
Hermione
however
had
move
her
orange
juice
aside
quickly
make
way
for
large
damp
barn
owl
bearing
soddenDaily
Prophet
its
beak
What
are
you
still
getting
that
for
said
Harry
irritably
thinking
Seamus
Hermione
placed
Knut
the
leather
pouch
the
owl
leg
and
took
off
again
not
bothering
load
rubbish
best
know
what
the
enemy
saying
said
Hermione
darkly
and
she
unfurled
the
newspaper
and
disappeared
behind
not
emerging
until
Harry
and
Ron
had
finished
eating
Nothing
she
said
simply
rolling
the
newspaper
and
laying
down
her
plate
Nothing
about
you
Dumbledore
anything
Professor
McGonagall
was
now
moving
along
the
table
handing
out
timetables
Look

groaned
Ron

Fred
arriving
with
George
and
squeezing
the
bench
beside
Harry
Hogwarts

wish

Look

said
Ron
grumpily
shoving
his
timetable
under
Fred
nose
That

Fair

said
Fred
scanning
the
column
You

Nosebleed

said
Ron
suspiciously
Because

said
George
helping
himself
kipper
Cheers
said
Ron
moodily
pocketing
his
timetable
but
think

the
lessons
And
speaking

Skiving

said
Hermione
eyeing
Fred
and
George
beadily

the
Gryffindor
noticeboard
Says

George
looking
astonished
Says
said
Hermione
And
Ron
Leave

said
Ron
hastily
Hermione
glared
him
Fred
and
George
sniggered
You

Hermione
said
Fred
thickly
buttering
crumpet
You

Yeah

Ron
Yep

Fred
unconcernedly
But
feel
our

outside

academic

seriously
debated
whether

Fred

what
the

Hogwarts
student

research
then
produce
products
fit
the
demand
But
where
are
you
going
get
the
gold
start
joke
shop
Hermione
asked
sceptically
You
going
need
all
the
ingredients
and
materials
and
premises
too
suppose
Harry
did
not
look
the
twins
His
face
felt
hot
deliberately
dropped
his
fork
and
dived
down
retrieve
heard
Fred
say
overhead
Ask
questions
and
tell
you
lies
Hermione
mon
George

Extendable
Ears
before
Herbology
Harry
emerged
from
under
the
table
see
Fred
and
George
walking
away
each
carrying
stack
toast
What
did
that
mean
said
Hermione
looking
from
Harry
Ron
Ask
questions
Does
that
mean
they
already
got
some
gold
start
joke
shop
You
know
been
wondering
about
that
said
Ron
his
brow
furrowed
They
bought
new
set
dress
robes
this
summer
and
couldn
understand
where
they
got
the
Galleons
Harry
decided
was
time
steer
the
conversation
out
these
dangerous
waters
you
reckon
true
this
year
going
really
tough
Because
the
exams
yeah
said
Ron
Bound
isn
are
really
important
affect
the
jobs
you
can
apply
for
and
everything
get
career
advice
too
later
this
year
Bill
told
you
can
choose
what
you
want
next
year
you
know
what
you
want
after
Hogwarts
Harry
asked
the
other
two
they
left
the
Great
Hall
shortly
afterwards
and
set
off
towards
their
History
Magic
classroom
Not
really
said
Ron
slowly
Except
well
looked
slightly
sheepish
What
Harry
urged
him
Well
cool
Auror
said
Ron
off
hand
voice
Yeah
would
said
Harry
fervently
But
they
like
the
elite
said
Ron
You
got
really
good
What
about
you
Hermione
don
know
she
said
think
like
something
really
worthwhile
Auror
worthwhile
said
Harry
Yes
but
not
the
only
worthwhile
thing
said
Hermione
thoughtfully
mean
could
take
further
Harry
and
Ron
carefully
avoided
looking
each
other
History
Magic
was
common
consent
the
most
boring
subject
ever
devised
wizardkind
Professor
Binns
their
ghost
teacher
had
wheezy
droning
voice
that
was
almost
guaranteed
cause
severe
drowsiness
within
ten
minutes
five
warm
weather
never
varied
the
form
their
lessons
but
lectured
them
without
pausing
while
they
took
notes
rather
gazed
sleepily
into
space
Harry
and
Ron
had
far
managed
scrape
passes
this
subject
only
copying
Hermione
notes
before
exams
she
alone
seemed
able
resist
the
soporific
power
Binns
voice
Today
they
suffered
hour
and
half
droning
the
subject
giant
wars
Harry
heard
just
enough
within
the
first
ten
minutes
appreciate
dimly
that
another
teacher
hands
this
subject
might
have
been
mildly
interesting
but
then
his
brain
disengaged
and
spent
the
remaining
hour
and
twenty
minutes
playing
hangman
ona
corner
his
parchment
with
Ron
while
Hermione
shot
them
filthy
looks
out
the
corner
her
eye
How
would
she
asked
them
coldly
they
left
the
classroom
for
break
Binns
drifting
away
through
the
blackboard
refused
lend
you
notes
this
year
fail
our
said
Ron
you
want
that
your
conscience
Hermione
Well
you
deserve
she
snapped
You
don
even
try
listen
him
you
try
said
Ron
just
haven
got
your
brains
your
memory
your
concentration
you
just
cleverer
than
are
nice
rub
don
give
that
rubbish
said
Hermione
but
she
looked
slightly
mollified
she
led
the
way
out
into
the
damp
courtyard
fine
misty
drizzle
was
falling
that
the
people
standing
huddles
around
the
edges
the
yard
looked
blurred
the
edges
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
chose
secluded
corner
under
heavily
dripping
balcony
turning
the
collars
their
robes
against
the
chilly
September
air
and
talking
about
what
Snape
was
likely
set
them
the
first
lesson
the
year
They
had
got
far
agreeing
that
was
likely
something
extremely
difficult
just
catch
them
off
guard
after
two
month
holiday
when
someone
walked
around
the
corner
towards
them
Hello
Harry
was
Cho
Chang
and
what
was
more
she
was
her
own
again
This
was
most
unusual
Cho
was
almost
always
surrounded
gang
giggling
girls
Harry
remembered
the
agony
trying
get
her
herself
ask
her
the
Yule
Ball
said
Harry
feeling
his
face
grow
hot
least
you
not
covered
Stinksap
this
time
told
himself
Cho
seemed
thinking
along
the
same
lines
You
got
that
stuff
off
then
Yeah
said
Harry
trying
grin
though
the
memory
their
last
meeting
was
funny
opposed
mortifying
did
you
have
good
summer
The
moment
had
said
this
wished
hadn
Cedric
had
been
Cho
boyfriend
and
the
memory
his
death
must
have
affected
her
holiday
almost
badly
had
affected
Harry
Something
seemed
tauten
her
face
but
she
said
was
all
right
you
know
that
Tornados
badge
Ron
demanded
suddenly
pointing
the
front
Cho
robes
where
sky
blue
badge
emblazoned
with
double
gold
was
pinned
You
don
support
them
you
Yeah
said
Cho
Have
you
always
supported
them
just
since
they
started
winning
the
league
said
Ron
what
Harry
considered
unnecessarily
accusatory
tone
voice
supported
them
since
was
six
said
Cho
coolly
Anyway
see
you
Harry
She
walked
away
Hermione
waited
until
Cho
was
halfway
across
the
courtyard
before
rounding
Ron
You
are
tactless
What
only
asked
her
Couldn
you
tell
she
wanted
talk
Harry
her
own
She
could
done
wasn
stopping
Why
earth
were
you
attacking
her
about
her
Quidditch
team
Attacking
wasn
attacking
her
was
only
Whocares
she
supports
the
Tornados
come
half
the
people
you
see
wearing
those
badges
only
bought
them
last
season
But
what
does
matter
means
they
not
real
fans
they
just
jumping
the
bandwagon
That
the
bell
said
Harry
dully
because
Ron
and
Hermione
were
bickering
too
loudly
hear
They
did
not
stop
arguing
all
the
way
down
Snape
dungeon
which
gave
Harry
plenty
time
reflect
that
between
Neville
and
Ron
would
lucky
ever
have
two
minutes
conversation
with
Cho
that
could
look
back
without
wanting
leave
the
country
And
yet
thought
they
joined
the
queue
lining
outside
Snape
classroom
door
she
had
chosen
come
and
talk
him
hadn
she
She
had
been
Cedric
girlfriend
she
could
easily
have
hated
Harry
for
coming
out
the
Triwizard
maze
alive
when
Cedric
had
died
yet
she
was
talking
him
perfectly
friendly
way
not
though
she
thought
him
mad
liar
some
horrible
way
responsible
for
Cedric
death
yes
she
had
definitely
chosen
come
and
talk
him
and
that
made
the
second
time
two
days
and
this
thought
Harry
spirits
rose
Even
the
ominous
sound
Snape
dungeon
door
creaking
open
did
not
puncture
the
small
hopeful
bubble
that
seemed
have
swelled
his
chest
filed
into
the
classroom
behind
Ron
and
Hermione
and
followed
them
their
usual
table
the
back
where
sat
down
between
Ron
and
Hermione
and
ignored
the
huffy
irritable
noises
now
issuing
from
both
them
Settle
down
said
Snape
coldly
shutting
the
door
behind
him
There
was
real
need
for
the
call
order
the
moment
the
class
had
heard
the
door
close
quiet
had
fallen
and
all
fidgeting
stopped
Snape
mere
presence
was
usually
enough
ensure
class
silence
Before
begin
today
lesson
said
Snape
sweeping
over
his
desk
and
staring
around
them
all
think
appropriate
remind
you
that
next
June
you
will
sitting
important
examination
during
which
you
will
prove
how
much
you
have
learned
about
the
composition
and
use
magical
potions
Moronic
though
some
this
class
undoubtedly
are
expect
you
scrape
Acceptable
your
suffer
displeasure
His
gaze
lingered
this
time
Neville
who
gulped
After
this
year
course
many
you
will
cease
studying
with
Snape
went
take
only
the
very
best
into
Potions
class
which
means
that
some
will
certainly
saying
goodbye
His
eyes
rested
Harry
and
his
lip
curled
Harry
glared
back
feeling
grim
pleasure
the
idea
that
would
able
give
Potions
after
fifth
year
But
have
another
year
before
that
happy
moment
farewell
said
Snape
softly
whether
not
you
are
intending
attempt

all
you
concentrate
your
efforts
upon
maintaining
the

the

hour

half

Just
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
predicted
Snape
could
hardly
have
set
them
more
difficult
fiddly
potion
The
ingredients
had
added
the
cauldron
precisely
the
right

and
quantities
the
mixture
had
stirred
exactly
the
right
number
times
firstly
clockwise
then
anti

the
heat
the
flames
which
was
simmering
had
lowered
exactly

for
specific

minutes
before
the
final
ingredient
was
added
light
silver
vapour

now
rising
from

called
Snape
with
ten
minutes
left
Harry
who
was
sweating
profusely
looked
desperately
around
the
dungeon
His
own
cauldron
was
issuing
copious
amounts
dark
grey
steam
Ron
was
spitting
green
sparks
Seamus
was
feverishly
prodding
the
flames
the
base
his
cauldron
with
the
tip
his
wand
they
seemed
going
out
The
surface
Hermione

however
was

and
Snape

down
his
hooked
nose
without
comment

meant
could
find
nothing
criticise

however
Snape
stopped
and
looked
down
with
horrible
smirk
his
face
Potter
what
this
supposed
The
Slytherins
the
front
the
class
all
looked
eagerly
they
loved
hearing
Snape
taunt
Harry
The
Draught
Peace
said
Harry
tensely
Tell
Potter
said
Snape
softly
can
you
read
Draco
Malfoy
laughed
Yes
can
said
Harry
his
fingers
clenched
tightly
around
his
wand
Read
the
third
line
the
instructions
for
Potter
Harry
squinted
the
blackboard
was
not
easy
make
out
the
instructions
through
the
haze

coloured

now
filling
the
dungeon
Add
powdered
moonstone
stir
three
times
counter
clockwise
allow

for
seven
minutes
then
add
two
drops

His
heart
sank
had
not
added
syrup
hellebore
but
had
proceeded
straight
the
fourth
line
the
instructions
after
allowing
his
potion
simmer
for
seven
minutes
Did
you
everything
the
third
line
Potter
said
Harry
very
quietly
beg
your
pardon
said
Harry
more
loudly

that

The

Thursday
While
everyone
around
him
filled
their
flagons
Harry
cleared
away
his
things
seething
His
potion
had
been
worse
than
Ron
which
was
now
giving
off
foul
odour
bad
eggs
Neville
which
had
achieved
the
consistency
just
mixed
cement
and
which
Neville
was
now
having
gouge
out
his
cauldron
yet
was
Harry
who
would
receiving
zero
marks
for
the
day
work
stuffed
his
wand
back
intohis
bag
and
slumped
down
his
seat
watching
everyone
else
march
Snape
desk
with
filled
and
corked
flagons
When
long
last
the
bell
rang
Harry
was
first
out
the
dungeon
and
had
already
started
his
lunch
the
time
Ron
and
Hermione
joined
him
the
Great
Hall
The
ceiling
hadturned
even
murkier
grey
during
the
morning
Rain
was
lashing
the
high
windows
That
was
really
unfair
said
Hermione
consolingly
sitting
down
next
Harry
and
helping
herself
shepherd
pie
Your
potion
wasn
nearly
bad
Goyle
when
put
his
flagon
the
whole
thing
shattered
and
set
his
robes
fire
Yeah
well
said
Harry
glowering
his
plate
since
when
has
Snape
ever
been
fair
Neither
the
others
answered
all
three
them
knew
that
Snape
and
Harry
mutual
enmity
had
been
absolute
from
the
moment
Harry
had
set
foot
Hogwarts
did
think
might
bit
better
this
year
said
Hermione
disappointed
voice
mean
you
know
she
looked
around
carefully
there
were
half
dozen
empty
seats
either
side
them
and
nobody
was
passing
the
table
now
the
Order
and
everything
Poisonous
toadstools
don
change
their
spots
said
Ron
sagely
Anyway
always
thought
Dumbledore
was
cracked
trust
Snape
Where
the
evidence
ever
really
stopped
working
for
You
Know
Who
think
Dumbledore
probably
got
plenty
evidence
even
doesn
share
with
you
Ron
snapped
Hermione
shut
the
pair
you
said
Harry
heavily
Ron
opened
his
mouth
argue
back
Hermione
and
Ron
both
froze
looking
angry
and
offended
Can
you
give
rest
said
Harry
You
always
having
each
other
driving
mad
And
abandoning
his
shepherd
pie
swung
his
schoolbag
back
over
his
shoulder
and
left
them
sitting
there
walked
the
marble
staircase
two
steps
time
past
the
many
students
hurrying
towards
lunch
The
anger
that
had
just
flared
unexpectedly
still
blazed
inside
him
and
the
vision
Ron
and
Hermione
shocked
faces
afforded
him
sense
deep
satisfaction
Serve
them
right
thought
why
can
they
give
rest
bickering
all
the
time
enough
drive
anyone
the
wall
passed
the
large
picture
Sir
Cadogan
the
knight
landing
Sir
Cadogan
drew
his
sword
and
brandished
fiercely
Harry
who
ignored
him
Come
back
you
scurvy
dog
Stand
fast
and
fight
yelled
Sir
Cadogan
muffled
voice
from
behind
his
visor
but
Harry
merely
walked
and
when
Sir
Cadogan
attempted
follow
him
running
into
neighbouring
picture
was
rebuffed
its
inhabitant
large
and
angry
looking
wolfhound
Harry
spent
the
rest
the
lunch
hour
sitting
alone
underneath
the
trapdoor
the
top
North
Tower
Consequently
was
the
first
ascend
the
silver
ladder
that
led
Sybill
Trelawney
classroom
when
the
bell
rang
After
Potions
Divination
was
Harry
least
favourite
class
which
was
due
mainly
Professor
Trelawney
habit
predicting
his
premature
death
every
few
lessons
thin
woman
heavily
draped
shawls
and
glittering
with
strings
beads
she
always
reminded
Harry
some
kind
insect
with
her
glasses
hugely
magnifying
her
eyes
She
was
busy
putting
copies
battered
leather
bound
books
each
the
spindly
little
tables
with
which
her
room
was
littered
when
Harry
entered
the
room
but
the
light
cast
the
lamps
covered
scarves
and
the
low
burning
sickly
scented
fire
was
dim
she
appeared
not
notice
himas
took
seat
the
shadows
The
rest
the
class
arrived
over
the
next
five
minutes
Ron
emerged
from
the
trapdoor
looked
around
carefully
spotted
Harry
and
made
directly
for
him
directly
could
while
having
wend
his
way
between
tables
chairs
and
overstuffed
pouffes
Hermione
and
have
stopped
arguing
said
sitting
down
beside
Harry
Good
grunted
Harry
But
Hermione
says
she
thinks
would
nice
you
stopped
taking
out
your
temper
said
Ron
not
just
passing
the
message
said
Ron
talking
over
him
But
reckon
she
right
not
our
fault
how
Seamus
and
Snape
treat
you
never
said
Good
day
said
Professor
Trelawney
her
usual
misty
dreamy
voice
and
Harry
broke
off
again
feeling
both
annoyed
and
slightly
ashamed
himself
And
welcome
back
Divination
have
course
been
following
your
fortunes
most
carefully
over
the
holidays
and
delighted
see
that
you

you
would
You

immediately
embarked

Ron

said
Harry
impatiently
was
not
going
share
his
dreams
with
anyone
knew
perfectly
well
what
his
regular
nightmare
about
graveyard
meant
did
not
need
Ron
Professor

said
Harry
turning
the
pages
ofThe
Dream
Oracle
without
interest
was
very
dull
work
looking
bits
dreams
theOracle
and
Harry
was
not
cheered
when
Professor
Trelawney
set
them
the
task
keeping
dream
diary
for
month
homework
When
the
bell
went
and
Ron
led
the
way
back
down
the
ladder
Ron
grumbling
loudly

how

Fred

they
That
Umbridge
woman
had
better
not
give
any
When
they
entered
the
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
classroom
they
found
Professor
Umbridge
already
seated
the
teacher
desk
wearing
the
fluffy
pink
cardigan
the
night
before
and
the
black
velvet
bow
top
her
head
Harry
was
again
reminded
forcibly
large
fly
perched
unwisely
top
even
larger
toad
The
class
was
quiet
entered
the
room
Professor
Umbridge
was
yet
unknown
quantity
and
nobody
knew
how
strict
disciplinarian
she
was
likely
Well
good
afternoon
she
said
when
finally
the
whole
class
had
sat
down
few
people
mumbled

chanted
back
her
There
now
said
Professor
Umbridge
sweetly
That

too
difficult

Wands

Many
the
class
exchanged
gloomy
looks
the
order
wands
away

never
yet
been
followed
lesson
they
had
found
interesting
Harry
shoved
his
wand
back
inside
his
bag
and
pulled
out
quill
ink
and
parchment
Professor
Umbridge
opened
her
handbag
extracted
her
own
wand
which
was
unusually
short
one
and
tapped
the
blackboard
sharply
with
words
appeared
the
board
once

Well
now
your
teaching
this
subject
has
been
rather
disrupted
and
fragmented
hasn
stated
Professor
Umbridge
turning
face
the
class
with
her
hands
clasped
neatly
front
her
The
constant
changing

and

replaced

For
couple
minutes
the
room
was
full
the
sound
scratching
quills
parchment
When
everyone
had
copied
down
Professor
Umbridge
three
course

she
asked

There

Professor

rang
through
the

Good
said
Professor
Umbridge
should
like
you
turn
page
five
and
read
Chapter
One
Basics
for
Beginners
There
will
need
talk
Professor
Umbridge
left
the
blackboard
and
settled
herself
the
chair
behind
the
teacher
desk
observing
them
all
closely
with
those
pouchy
toad
eyes
Harry
turned
page
five
his
copy
ofDefensive
Magical
Theory
and
started
read
was
desperately
dull
quite
bad
listening
Professor
Binns
felt
his
concentration
sliding
away
from
him
had
soon
read
the
same
line
half
dozen
times
without
taking
more
than
the
first
few
words
Several
silent
minutes
passed
Next
him
Ron
was
absent
mindedly
turning
his
quill
over
and
over
his
fingers
staring
the
same
spot
the
page
Harry
looked
right
and
received
surprise
shake
him
out
his
torpor
Hermione
had
not
even
opened
her
copy
ofDefensive
Magical
Theory
She
was
staring
fixedly
Professor
Umbridge
with
her
hand
the
air
Harry
could
not
remember
Hermione
ever
neglecting
read
when
instructed
indeed
resisting
the
temptation
open
any
book
that
came
under
her
nose
looked
her
enquiringly
but
she
merely
shook
her
head
slightly
indicate
that
she
was
not
about
answer
questions
and
continued
stare
Professor
Umbridge
who
was
looking
just
resolutely
another
direction
After
several
more
minutes
had
passed
however
Harry
was
not
the
only
one
watching
Hermione
The
chapter
they
had
been
instructed
read
was
tedious
that
more
and
more
people
were
choosing
watch
Hermione
mute
attempt
catch
Professor
Umbridge
eye
rather
than
struggle
with
Basics
for
Beginners
When
more
than
half
the
class
were
staring
Hermione
rather
than
their
books
Professor
Umbridge
seemed
decide
that
she
could
ignore
the
situation
longer
Did
you
want
ask
something
about
the
chapter
dear
she
asked
Hermione
though
she
had
only
just
noticed
her
Not
about
the
chapter
said
Hermione
Well
reading
just
now
said
Professor
Umbridge
showing
her
small
pointed
teeth
you
have
other
queries
can
deal
with
them
the
end
class
got
query
about
your
course
aims
said
Hermione
Professor
Umbridge
raised
her
eyebrows
And
your
name
Hermione
Granger
said
Hermione
Well
Miss
Granger
think
the
course
aims
are
perfectly
clear
you
read
them
through
carefully
said
Professor
Umbridge
voice
determined
sweetness
Well
don
said
Hermione
bluntly
There
nothing
written
there
about
using
defensive
spells
There
was
short
silence
which
many
members
the
class
turned
their
heads
frown
the
three
course
aims
still
written
the
blackboard
Using
defensive
spells
Professor
Umbridge
repeated
with
little
laugh
Why
can
imagine
any
situation
arising
classroom
that
would
require
you
use
defensive
spell
Miss
Granger
You
surely
aren
expecting
attacked
during
class
not
going
use
magic
Ron
exclaimed
loudly
Students
raise
their
hands
when
they
wish
speak
class
Weasley
said
Ron
thrusting
his
hand
into
the
air
Professor
Umbridge
smiling
still
more
widely
turned
her
back
him
Harry
and
Hermione
immediately
raised
their
hands
too
Professor
Umbridge
pouchy
eyes
lingered
Harry
for
moment
before
she
addressed
Hermione
Yes
Miss
Granger
You
wanted
ask
something
else
Yes
said
Hermione
Surely
the
whole
point
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
practise
defensive
spells
Are
you
Ministry
trained
educational
expert
Miss
Granger
asked
Professor
Umbridge
her
falsely
sweet
voice
but
Well
then
afraid
you
are
not
qualified
decide
what
the
whole
point
any
class
Wizards
much
older
and
cleverer
than
you
have
devised
our
new
programme

You
will
learning
about
defensive
spells
secure

free
way
What
use
that
said
Harry
loudly
going
attacked
won
Hand
Potter
sang
Professor
Umbridge
Harry
thrust
his
fist
the
air
Again
Professor
Umbridge
promptly
turned
away
from
him
but
now
several
other
people
had
their
hands
too
And
your
name
Professor
Umbridge
said
Dean
Dean
Thomas
Well
Thomas
Well
like
Harry
said
isn
said
Dean
going
attacked
won
risk
free
repeat
said
Professor
Umbridge
smiling
very
irritating
fashion
Dean
you
expect
attacked
during
classes
but
Professor
Umbridge
talked
over
him
not
wish
criticise
the
way
things
have
been
run
this
school
she
said
unconvincing
smile
stretching
her
wide
mouth
but
you
have
been
exposed
some
very
irresponsible
wizards
this
class
very
irresponsible
indeed
not
mention
she
gave
nasty
little
laugh
extremely
dangerous
half
breeds
you
mean
Professor
Lupin
piped
Dean
angrily
was
the
best
ever
Hand
Thomas
was
saying
you
have
been
introduced
spells
that
have
been
complex
inappropriate
your
age
group
and
potentially
lethal
You
have
been
frightened
into
believing
that
you
are
likely
meet
Dark
attacks
every
other
day
haven
Hermione
said
just
Your
hand
not
Miss
Granger
Hermione
put
her
hand
Professor
Umbridge
turned
away
from
her
understanding
that
predecessor
not
only
performed
illegal
curses
front
you
actually
performed
them
you
Well
turned
out
maniac
didn
said
Dean
hotly
Mind
you
still
learned
loads
Your
hand
not
Thomas
trilled
Professor
Umbridge
Now
the
view
the
Ministry
that
theoretical
knowledge
will
more
than
sufficient
get
you
through
your
examination
which
after
all
what
school
all
about
And
your
name
she
added
staring
Parvati
whose
hand
had
just
shot
Parvati
Patil
and
isn
there
practical
bit
our
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
Aren
supposed
show
that
can
actually
the
counter
curses
and
things
long
you
have
studied
the
theory
hard
enough
there
reason
why
you
should
not
able
perform
the
spells
under
carefully
controlled
examination
conditions
said
Professor
Umbridge
dismissively
Without
ever
practising
them
beforehand
said
Parvati
incredulously
Are
you
telling
that
the
first
time
get
the
spells
will
during
our
exam
repeat
long
you
have
studied
the
theory
hard
enough
And
what
good
theory
going
the
real
world
said
Harry
loudly
his
fist
the
air
again
Professor
Umbridge
looked
This
school
Potter
not
the
real
world
she
said
softly
not
supposed
prepared
for
what
waiting
for
out
there
There
nothing
waiting
out
there
Potter
yeah
said
Harry
His
temper
which
seemed
have
been
bubbling
just
beneath
the
surface
all
day
was
reaching
boiling
point
Who
you
imagine
wants
attack
children
like
yourselves
enquired
Professor
Umbridge
horribly
honeyed
voice
Hmm
let
think
said
Harry
mock
thoughtful
voice
Maybe
Lord
Voldemort
Ron
gasped
Lavender
Brown
uttered
little
scream
Neville
slipped
sideways
off
his
stool
Professor
Umbridge
however
did
not
flinch
She
was
staring
Harry
with
grimly
satisfied
expression
her
face
Ten
points
from
Gryffindor
Potter
The
classroom
was
silent
and
still
Everyone
was
staring
either
Umbridge
Harry
Now
let
make
few
things
quite
plain
Professor
Umbridge
stood
and
leaned
towards
them
her
stubby
fingered
hands
splayed
her
desk
You
have
been
told
that
certain
Dark
wizard
has
returned
from
the
dead
wasn
dead
said
Harry
angrily
but
yeah
returned
Potter
you
have
already
lost
your
house
ten
points
not
make
matters
worse
for
yourself
said
Professor
Umbridge
one
breath
without
looking
him
was
saying
you
have
been
informed
that
certain
Dark
wizard
large
once
again
This
alie
NOT
lie
said
Harry
saw
him
fought
him
Detention
Potter
said
Professor
Umbridge
triumphantly
Tomorrow

Five

this
alie
The
Ministry
Magic

Basics
for
Beginners
Professor
Umbridge
sat
down
behind
her
desk
Harry
however
stood
Everyone
was
staring
him
Seamus
looked
half
scared
half
fascinated
Harry
Hermione
whispered
warning
voice
tugging
his
sleeve
but
Harry
jerked
his
arm
out
her
reach
according
you
Cedric
Diggory
dropped
dead
his
own
accord
did
Harry
asked
his
voice
shaking
There
was
collective
intake
breath
from
the
class
for
none
them
apart
from
Ron
and
Hermione
had
ever
heard
Harry
talk
about
what
had
happened
the
night
Cedric
had
died
They
stared
avidly
from
Harry
Professor
Umbridge
who
had
raised
her
eyes
and
was
staring
him
without
trace
fake
smile
her
face
Cedric
Diggory
death
was
tragic
accident
she
said
coldly
was
murder
said
Harry
could
feel
himself
shaking
had
hardly
spoken
anyone
about
this
least
all
thirty
eagerly
listening
classmates
Voldemort
killed
him
and
you
know
Professor
Umbridge
face
was
quite
blank
For
moment
Harry
thought
she
was
going
scream
him
Then
she
said
her
softest
most
sweetly
girlish
voice
Come
here
Potter
dear
kicked
his
chair
aside
strode
around
Ron
and
Hermione
and
the
teacher
desk
could
feel
the
rest
the
class
holding
its
breath
felt
angry
did
not
care
what
happened
next
Professor
Umbridge
pulled
small
roll
pink
parchment
out
her
handbag
stretched
out
the
desk
dipped
her
quill
into
bottle
ink
and
started
scribbling
hunched
over
that
Harry
could
not
see
what
she
was
writing
Nobody
spoke
After
minute
she
rolled
the
parchment
and
tapped
with
her
wand
sealed
itself
seamlessly
that
could
not
open
Take
this
Professor
McGonagall
dear
said
Professor
Umbridge
holding
out
the
note
him
took
from
her
without
saying
word
turned
his
heel
and
left
the
room
not
even
looking
back
Ron
and
Hermione
slamming
the
classroom
door
shut
behind
him
walked
very
fast
along
the
corridor
the
note
McGonagall
clutched
tight
his
hand
and
turning
corner
walked
slap
into
Peeves
the
poltergeist
wide
mouthed
little
man
floating
his
back
midair
juggling
several
inkwells
Why
Potty
Wee
Potter
cackled
Peeves
allowing
two
the
inkwells
fall
the
ground
where
they
smashed
and
spattered
the
walls
with
ink
Harry
jumped
backwards
out
the
way
with
snarl
Get
out
Peeves
Oooh
Crackpot
feeling
cranky
said
Peeves
pursuing
Harry
along
the
corridor
leering
zoomed
along
above
him
What
this
time
fine
Potty
friend
Hearing
voices
Seeing
visions
Speaking
Peeves
blew
gigantic
raspberry
tongues
said
leave
ALONE
Harry
shouted
running
down
the
nearest
flight
stairs
but
Peeves
merely
slid
down
the
banister
his
back
beside
him
most
think
barking
the
potty
wee
lad
But
some
are
more
kindly
and
think
just
sad
But
Peevesy
knows
better
and
says
that
mad
SHUT
door
his
left
flew
open
and
Professor
McGonagall
emerged
from
her
office
looking
grim
and
slightly
harassed
What
onearth
are
you
shouting
about
Potter
she
snapped
Peeves
cackled
gleefully
and
zoomed
out
sight
Why
aren
you
class
been
sent
see
you
said
Harry
stiffly
Sent
What
you
mean
sent
held
out
the
note
from
Professor
Umbridge
Professor
McGonagall
took
from
him
frowning
slit
open
with
tap
her
wand
stretched
out
and
began
read
Her
eyes
zoomed
from
side
side
behind
their
square
spectacles
she
read
what
Umbridge
had
written
and
with
each
line
they
became
narrower
Come
here
Potter
followed
her
inside
her
study
The
door
closed
automatically
behind
him
Well
said
Professor
McGonagall
rounding
him
this
true
what
true
Harry
asked
rather
more
aggressively
than
had
intended
Professor
added
attempt
sound
more
polite
true
that
you
shouted
Professor
Umbridge
Yes
said
Harry
You
called
her
liar
Yes
You
told
her
Who
Must
Not
Named
back
Yes
Professor
McGonagall
sat
down
behind
her
desk
watching
Harry
closely
Then
she
said
Have
biscuit
Potter
Have
what
Have
biscuit
she
repeated
impatiently
indicating
tartan
tin
lying
top
one
the
piles
papers
her
desk
And
sit
down
There
had
been
previous
occasion
when
Harry
expecting
caned
Professor
McGonagall
had
instead
been
appointed
her
the
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
sank
into
chair
opposite
her
and
helped
himself
Ginger
Newt
feeling
just
confused
and
wrong
footed
had
done
that
occasion
Professor
McGonagall
set
down
Professor
Umbridge
note
and
looked
very
seriously
Harry
Potter
you
need
careful
Harry
swallowed
his
mouthful
Ginger
Newt
and
stared
her
Her
tone
voice
was
not
all
what
was
used
was
not
brisk
crisp
and
stern
was
low
and
anxious
and
somehow
much
more
human
than

Misbehaviour

cost
you
much
more
than

What

Professor
McGonagall
with
abrupt
return
her
usual
manner
You

comes
from

know
whom

reporting
The
bell
rang
for

Overhead
and

the
elephantine
sounds

students

Professor
McGonagall

again

horrified

flatly

But

Harry
outraged
Voldemort

Dumbledore

For

sake
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
straightening
her
glasses
angrily
she
had
winced
horribly
when
had
used
Voldemort
name
you
really
think
this
about
truth
lies
about
keeping
your
head
down
and
your
temper
under
control
She
stood
nostrils
wide
and
mouth
very
thin
and
Harry
stood
too
Have

biscuit
she
said
irritably
thrusting
the
tin
him

Harry
coldly
Don

snapped

grudgingly

Professor
McGonagall
eyed
him
closely
for
moment
then
sniffed
walked
around
her
desk
and
held
open
the
door
for
him
Well
glad
you

Hermione
Granger
any
rate
she
said
pointing
him
out
her
office
DETENTION
WITH
DOLORES
Dinner
the
Great
Hall
that
night
was
not
pleasant
experience
for
Harry
The
news
about
his
shouting
match
with
Umbridge
had
travelled
exceptionally
fast
even
Hogwarts
standards
heard
whispers
all
around
him
sat
eating
between
Ron
and
Hermione
The
funny
thing
was
that
none
the
whisperers
seemed
mind
him
overhearing
what
they
were
saying
about
him
the
contrary
was
though
they
were
hoping
would
get
angry
and
start
shouting
again
that
they
could
hear
his
story
first
hand
says
saw
Cedric
Diggory
murdered
reckons
duelled
with
You
Know
Who
Come
off
Who
does
think
kidding
Pur
lease
What
don
get
said
Harry
through
clenched
teeth
laying
down
his
knife
and
fork
his
hands
were
shaking
too
much
hold
them
steady
why
they
all
believed
the
story
two
months
ago
when
Dumbledore
told
them
The
thing
Harry
not
sure
they
did
said
Hermione
grimly
let
get
out
here
She
slammed
down
her
own
knife
and
fork
Ron
looked
longingly
his
half
finished
apple
pie
but
followed
suit
People
stared
them
all
the
way
out
the
Hall
What
you
mean
you
not
sure
they
believed
Dumbledore
Harry
asked
Hermione
when
they
reached
the
first
floor
landing
Look
you
don
understand
what
was
like
after
happened
said
Hermione
quietly
You
arrived
back
the
middle
the
lawn
clutching
Cedric
dead
body
none
saw
what
happened
the
maze
just
had
Dumbledore
word
for
that
You
Know
Who
had
come
back
and
killedCedric
and
fought
you
Which
the
truth
said
Harry
loudly
know
Harry
will
youplease
stop
biting
head
off
said
Hermione
wearily
just
that
before
the
truth
could
sink
everyone
went
home
for
the
summer
where
they
spent
two
months
reading
about
how
you
nutcase
and
Dumbledore
going
senile
Rain
pounded
the
windowpanes
they
strode
along
the
empty
corridors
back
Gryffindor
Tower
Harry
felt
though
his
first
day
had
lasted
week
but
still
had
mountain
homework
before
bed
dull
pounding
pain
was
developing
over
his
right
eye
glanced
out
rain
washed
window
the
dark
grounds
they
turned
into
the
Fat
Lady
corridor
There
was
still
light
Hagrid
cabin
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
said
Hermione
before
the
Fat
Lady
could
ask
The
portrait
swung
open
reveal
the
hole
behind
and
the
three
them
scrambled
through
The
common
room
was
almost
empty
nearly
everyone
was
still
down
dinner
Crookshanks
uncoiled
himself
from
armchair
and
trotted
meet
them
purring
loudly
and
when
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
took
their
three
favourite
chairs
the
fireside
leapt
lightly
Hermione
lap
and
curled
there
like
furry
ginger
cushion
Harry
gazed
into
the
flames
feeling
drained
and
exhausted
How
can
Dumbledore
have
let
this
happen
Hermione
cried
suddenly
making
Harry
and
Ron
jump
Crookshanks
leapt
off
her
looking
affronted
She
pounded
the
arms
her
chair
fury
that
bits
stuffing
leaked
out
the
holes
How
can
let
that
terrible
woman
teach
And
our
year
too
Well
never
had
great
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teachers
have
said
Harry
You
know
what
like
Hagrid
told
nobody
wants
the
job
they
say
jinxed
Yes
but
employ
someone
who
actually
refusing
let
magic
What
Dumbledore
playing
And
she
trying
get
people
spy
for
her
said
Ron
darkly
Remember
when
she
said
she
wanted
come
and
tell
her
hear
anyone
saying
You
Know
Who
back
course
she
here
spy
all
that
obvious
why
else
would
Fudge
have
wanted
her
come
snapped
Hermione
Don
start
arguing
again
said
Harry
wearily
Ron
opened
his
mouth
retaliate
Can
just
let
just
that
homework
get
out
the
way
They
collected
their
schoolbags
from
corner
and
returned
the
chairs
the
fire
People
were
coming
back
from
dinner
now
Harry
kept
his
face
averted
from
the
portrait
hole
but
could
still
sense
the
stares
was
attracting
Shall
Snape
stuff
first
said
Ron
dipping
his
quill
into
his
ink
The
properties
moonstone
and
uses
potion
making
muttered
writing
the
words
across
the
top
his
parchment
spoke
them
There
underlined
the
title
then
looked
expectantly
Hermione
what
are
the
properties
moonstone
and
its
uses
potion
making
But
Hermione
was
not
listening
she
was
squinting
over
into
the
far
corner
the
room
where
Fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
were
now
sitting
the
centre
knot
innocent
looking
first
years
all
whom
were
chewing
something
that
seemed
have
come
out
large
paper
bag
that
Fred
was
holding
sorry
they
gone
too
far
she
said
standing
and
looking
positively
furious
Come
Ron
what
said
Ron
plainly
playing
for
time
come
Hermione
can
tell
them
off
for
giving
out
sweets
You
know
perfectly
well
that
those
are
bits
Nosebleed
Nougat
Puking
Pastilles
Fainting
Fancies
Harry
suggested
quietly
One
one
though
hit
over
the
head
with
invisible
mallet
the
first
years
were
slumping
unconscious
their
seats
some
slid
right
the
floor
others
merely
hung
over
the
arms
their
chairs
their
tongues
lolling
out
Most
the
people
watching
were
laughing
Hermione
however
squared
her
shoulders
and
marched
directly
over
where
Fred
and
George
now
stood
with
clipboards
closely
observing
the
unconscious
first
years
Ron
rose
halfway
out
his
chair
hovered
uncertainly
for
moment
two
then
muttered
Harry
She
got
under
control
before
sinking
low
his
chair
his
lanky
frame
permitted
That
enough
Hermione
said
forcefully
Fred
and
George
both
whom
looked
mild
surprise
Yeah
you
right
said
George
nodding
this
dosage
looks
strong
enough
doesn
told
you

morning

said
Fred
indignantly

Rubbish

Fred
Calm

Hermione

said
Lee
reassuringly
walked
from
first
year
first
year
inserting
purple
sweets
into
their
open
mouths
Yeah
look
they
coming
round
now
said
George
few
the
first
years
were
indeed
stirring
Several
looked
shocked
find
themselves
lying
the
floor
dangling
off
their
chairs
that
Harry
was
sure
Fred
and
George
had
not
warned
them
what
the
sweets
were
going
Feel
all
right
said
George
kindly
small
dark
haired
girl
lying
his
feet
think
she
said
shakily
Excellent
said
Fred
happily
but
the
next
second
Hermione
had
snatched
both
his
clipboard
and
the
paper
bag
Fainting
Fancies
from
his
hands
NOT
excellent
Course
they
alive
aren
they
said
Fred
angrily
You
can
this
what
you
made
one
them
really
ill
not
going
make
them
ill
already
tested
them
all
ourselves
this

everyone
reacts
the
same
you
don
stop
doing
going
Put
detention
said
Fred
like
see
you
try
voice
Make
write
lines
said
George
smirking
Onlookers
all
over
the
room
were
laughing
Hermione
drew
herself
her
full
height
her
eyes
were
narrowed
and
her
bushy
hair
seemed
crackle
with
electricity
she
said
her
voice
quivering
with
anger
but
will
write
your
mother
You
wouldn
said
George
horrified
taking
step
back
from
her
yes
would
said
Hermione
grimly
can
stop
you
eating
the
stupid
things
yourselves
but
you
not
give
them
the
first
years
Fred
and
George
looked
thunderstruck
was
clear
that
far
they
were
concerned
Hermione
threat
was
way
below
the
belt
With
last
threatening
look
them
she
thrust
Fred
clipboard
and
the
bag
Fancies
back
into
his
arms
and
stalked
back
her
chair
the
fire
Ron
was
now
low
his
seat
that
his
nose
was
roughly
level
with
his
knees
Thank
you
for
your
support
Ron
Hermione
said
acidly
You
handled
fine
yourself
Ron
mumbled
Hermione
stared
down
her
blank
piece
parchment
for
few
seconds
then
said
edgily
good
can
concentrate
now
going
bed
She
wrenched
her
bag
open
Harry
thought
she
was
about
put
her
books
away
but
instead
she
pulled
out
two
misshapen
woolly
objects
placed
them
carefully
table
the
fireplace
covered
them
with
few
screwed
bits
parchment
and
broken
quill
and
stood
back
admire
the
effect
What
the
name
Merlin
are
you
doing
said
Ron
watching
her
though
fearful
for
her
sanity
They
hats
for
house
elves
she
said
briskly
now
stuffing
her
books
back
into
her
bag
did
them
over
the
summer
really
slow
knitter
without
magic
but
now
back
school
should
able
make
lots
more
You
leaving
out
hats
for
the
house
elves
said
Ron
slowly
And
you
covering
them
with
rubbish
first
Yes
said
Hermione
defiantly
swinging
her
bag
her
back
That
not
said
Ron
angrily
You
trying
trick
them
into
picking
the
hats
You
setting
them
free
when
they
might
not
want
free
course
they
want
free
said
Hermione
once
though
her
face
was
turning
pink
Don
you
dare
touch
those
hats
Ron
She
turned
her
heel
and
left
Ron
waited
until
she
had
disappeared
through
the
door
the
girls
dormitories
then
cleared
the
rubbish
off
the
woolly
hats
They
should
least
see
what
they
picking
said
firmly
Anyway
rolled
the
parchment
which
had
written
the
title
Snape
essay
there
point
trying
finish
this
now
can
without
Hermione
haven
got
clue
what
you
supposedto
with
moonstones
have
you
Harry
shook
his
head
noticing
did
that
the
ache
his
right
temple
was
getting
worse
thought
the
long
essay
giant
wars
and
the
pain
stabbed
him
sharply
Knowing
perfectly
well
that
when
the
morning
came
would
regret
not
finishing
his
homework
that
night
piled
his
books
back
into
his
bag
going
bed
too
passed
Seamus
the
way
the
door
leading
the
dormitories
but
did
not
look
him
Harry
had
fleeting
impression
that
Seamus
had
opened
his
mouth
speak
but
sped
and
reached
the
soothing
peace
the
stone
spiral
staircase
without
having
endure
any
more
provocation
The
following
day
dawned
just
leaden
and
rainy
the
previous
one
Hagrid
was
still
absent
from
the
staff
table
breakfast
But
the
plus
side
Snape
today
said
Ron
bracingly
Hermione
yawned
widely
and
poured
herself
some
coffee
She
looked
mildly
pleased
about
something
and
when
Ron
asked
her
what
she
had
happy
about
she
simply
said
The
hats
have
gone
Seems
the
house
elves
want
freedom
after
all
wouldn
bet
Ron
told
her
cuttingly
They
might
not
count
clothes
They
didn
look
anything
like
hats
more
like
woolly
bladders
Hermione
did
not
speak
him
all
morning
Double
Charms
was
succeeded
double
Transfiguration
Professor
Flitwick
and
Professor
McGonagall
both
spent
the
first
fifteen
minutes
their
lessons
lecturing
the
class
the
importance
What
you
must
remember
said
little
Professor
Flitwick
squeakily
perched
ever
pile
books
that
could
see
over
the
top
his
desk
that
these
examinations
may
influence
your
futures
for
many
years
come
you
have
not
already
given
serious
thought
your
careers
now
the
time
And
the
meantime
afraid
shall
working
harder
than
ever
ensure
that
you
all
yourselves
justice
They
then
spent
over
hour
revising
Summoning
Charms
which
according
Professor
Flitwick
were
bound
come
their
and
rounded
off
the
lesson
setting
them
their
largest
ever
amount
Charms
homework
was
the
same
not
worse
Transfiguration
You
cannot
pass
said
Professor
McGonagall
grimly
without
serious
application
practice
and
study
see
reason
why
everybody
this
class
should
not
achieve
Transfiguration
long
they
put
the
work
Neville
made
sad
little
disbelieving
noise
Yes
you
too
Longbottom
said
Professor
McGonagall
There
nothing
wrong
with
your
work
except
lack
confidence
today
are
starting
Vanishing
Spells
These
are
easier
than
Conjuring
Spells
which
you
would
not
usually
attempt
until
level
but
they
are
still
among
the
most
difficult
magic
you
will
tested
your
She
was
quite
right
Harry
found
the
Vanishing
Spells
horribly
difficult
the
end
double
period
neither
nor
Ron
had
managed
vanish
the
snails
which
they
were
practising
though
Ron
said
hopefully
thought
his
looked
bit
paler
Hermione
the
other
hand
successfully
vanished
her
snail
the
third
attempt
earning
her
ten
point
bonus
for
Gryffindor
from
Professor
McGonagall
She
was
the
only
person
not
given
homework
everybody
else
was
told
practise
the
spell
overnight
ready
for
fresh
attempt
their
snails
the
following
afternoon
Now
panicking
slightly
about
the
amount
homework
they
had
Harry
and
Ron
spent
their
lunch
hour
the
library
looking
the
uses
moonstones
potion
making
Still
angry
about
Ron
slur
her
woolly
hats
Hermione
did
not
join
them
the
time
they
reached
Care
Magical
Creatures
the
afternoon
Harry
head
was
aching
again
The
day
had
become
cool
and
breezy
and
they
walked
down
the
sloping
lawn
towards
Hagrid
cabin
the
edge
the
Forbidden
Forest
they
felt
the
occasional
drop
rain
their
faces
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
stood
waiting
for
the
class
some
ten
yards
from
Hagrid
front
door
long
trestle
table
front
her
laden
with
twigs
Harry
and
Ron
reached
her
loud
shout
laughter
sounded
behind
them
turning
they
saw
Draco
Malfoy
striding
towards
them
surrounded
his
usual
gang
Slytherin
cronies
had
clearly
just
said
something
highly
amusing
because
Crabbe
Goyle
Pansy
Parkinson
and
the
rest
continued
snigger
heartily
they
gathered
around
the
trestle
table
and
judging
the
way
they
all
kept
looking
over
Harry
was
able
guess
the
subject
the
joke
without
too
much
difficulty
Everyone
here
barked
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
once
all
the
Slytherins
and
Gryffindors
had
arrived
Let
crack
then
Who
can
tell
what
these
things
are
called
She
indicated
the
heap
twigs
front
her
Hermione
hand
shot
into
the
air
Behind
her
back
Malfoy
did
buck
toothed
imitation
her
jumping
and
down
eagerness
answer
question
Pansy
Parkinson
gave
shriek
laughter
that
turned
almost
once
into
scream
the
twigs
the
table
leapt
into
the
air
and
revealed
themselves
tobe
what
looked
like
tiny
pixie
ish
creatures
made
wood
each
with
knobbly
brown
arms
and
legs
two
twiglike
fingers
the
end
each
hand
and
funny
flat
barklike
face
which
pair
beetle
brown
eyes
glittered
Oooooh
said
Parvati
and
Lavender
thoroughly
irritating
Harry
Anyone
would
have
thought
Hagrid
had
never
shown
them
impressive
creatures
admittedly
the
Flobberworms
had
been
bit
dull
but
the
Salamanders
and
Hippogriffs
had
been
interesting
enough
and
the
Blast
Ended
Skrewts
perhaps
too
much
Kindly
keep
your
voices
down
girls
said
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
sharply
scattering
handful
what
looked
like
brown
rice
among
the
stick
creatures
who
immediately
fell
upon
the
food
anyone
know
the
names
these
creatures
Miss
Granger
Bowtruckles
said
Hermione
They
tree
guardians
usually
live
wand
trees
Five
points
for
Gryffindor
said
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
Yes
these
are
Bowtruckles
and
Miss
Granger
rightly
says
they
generally
live
trees
whose
wood
wand
quality
Anybody
know
what
they
eat
Woodlice
said
Hermione
promptly
which
explained
why
what
Harry
had
taken
grains
brown
rice
were
moving
But
fairy
eggs
they
can
get
them
Good
girl
take
another
five
points
whenever
you
need
leaves
wood
from
tree
which
Bowtruckle
lodges
wise
have
gift
woodlice
ready
distract
placate
They
may
not
look
dangerous
but
angered
they
will
try
gouge
human
eyes
with
their
fingers
which
you
can
see
are
very
sharp
and
not
all
desirable
near
the
eyeballs
you
like
gather
closer
take
few
woodlice
and
Bowtruckle
have
enough
here
for
one
between
three
you
can
study
them
more
closely
want
sketch
from
each
you
with
all
body
parts
labelled
the
end
the
lesson
The
class
surged
forwards
around
the
trestle
table
Harry
deliberately
circled
around
the
back
that
ended
right
next
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
Where
Hagrid
asked
her
while
everyone
else
was
choosing
Bowtruckles
Never
you
mind
said
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
repressively
which
had
been
her
attitude
last
time
Hagrid
had
failed
turn
for
class
too
Smirking
all
over
his
pointed
face
Draco
Malfoy
leaned
across
Harry
and
seized
the
largest
Bowtruckle
Maybe
said
Malfoy
undertone
that
only
Harry
could
hear
him
the
stupid
great
oaf
got
himself
badly
injured
Maybe
you
will
you
don
shut
said
Harry
out
the
side
his
mouth
Maybe
been
messing
with
stuff
that
toobig
for
him
you
get
drift
Malfoy
walked
away
smirking
over
his
shoulder
Harry
who
felt
suddenly
sick
Did
Malfoy
know
something
His
father
was
Death
Eater
after
all
what
had
information
about
Hagrid
fate
that
had
not
yet
reached
the
ears
the
Order
hurried
back
around
the
table
Ron
and
Hermione
who
were
squatting
the
grass
some
distance
away
and
attempting
persuade
Bowtruckle
remain
still
long
enough
for
them
draw
Harry
pulled
out
parchment
and
quill
crouched
down
beside
the
others
and
related
whisper
what
Malfoy
had
just
said
Dumbledore
would
know
some
thing
had
happened
Hagrid
said
Hermione
once
just
playing
into
Malfoy
hands
look
worried
tells
him
don
know
exactly
what
going
got
ignore
him
Harry
Here
hold
the
Bowtruckle
for
moment
just
can
drawits
face
Yes
came
Malfoy
clear
drawl
from
the
group
nearest
them
Father
was
talking
the
Minister
just
couple
days
ago
you
know
and
sounds
though
the
Ministry
really
determined
crack
down
sub
standard
teaching
this
place
even
that
overgrown
morondoes
show
again
probably
sent
packing
straightaway
OUCH
Harry
had
gripped
the
Bowtruckle
hard
that
had
almost
snapped
and
had
just
taken
great
retaliatory
swipe
his
hand
with
its
sharp
fingers
leaving
two
long
deep
cuts
there
Harry
dropped
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
had
already
been
guffawing
the
idea
Hagrid
being
sacked
laughed
still
harder
the
Bowtruckle
set
off
full
tilt
towards
the
Forest
little
moving
stick
man
soon
swallowed
among
the
tree
roots
When
the
bell
echoed
distantly
over
the
grounds
Harry
rolled
his
blood
stained
Bowtruckle
picture
and
marched
off
Herbology
with
his
hand
wrapped
Hermione
handkerchief
and
Malfoy
derisive
laughter
still
ringing
his
ears
calls
Hagrid
moron
one
more
time
said
Harry
through
gritted
teeth
Harry
don
picking
row
with
Malfoy
don
forget
prefect
now
could
make
life
difficult
for
you
Wow
wonder
what
like
have
difficult
life
said
Harry
sarcastically
Ron
laughed
but
Hermione
frowned
Together
they
traipsed
across
the
vegetable
patch
The
sky
still
appeared
unable
make
its
mind
whether
wanted
rain
not
just
wish
Hagrid
would
hurry
and
get
back
that
all
said
Harry
low
voice
they
reached
the
greenhouses
Anddon
tsay
that
Grubbly
Plank
woman
better
teacher
added
threateningly
wasn
going
said
Hermione
calmly
Because
she
never

Hagrid
said
Harry
firmly
fully
aware
that
had
just
experienced
exemplary
Care
Magical
Creatures
lesson
and
was
thoroughly
annoyed
about
The
door
the
nearest
greenhouse
opened
and
some
fourth
years
spilled
out
including
Ginny
she
said
brightly
she
passed
few
seconds
later
Luna
Lovegood
emerged
trailing
behind
the
rest
the
class
smudge
earth
her
nose
and
her
hair
tied
knot
the
top
her
head
When
she
saw
Harry
her
prominent
eyes
seemed
bulge
excitedly
and
she
made
beeline
straight
for
him
Many
his
classmates
turned
curiously
watch
Luna
took
great
breath
and
then
said
without
much
preliminary
hello
believe
Who
Must
Not
Named
back
and
believe
you
fought
him
and
escaped
from
him
right
said
Harry
awkwardly
Luna
was
wearing
what
looked
like
pair
orange
radishes
for
earrings
fact
that
Parvati
and
Lavender
seemed
have
noticed
they
were
both
giggling
and
pointing
her
earlobes
You
can
laugh
Luna
said
her
voice
rising
apparently
under
the
impression
that
Parvati
and
Lavender
were
laughing
what
she
had
said
rather
than
what
she
was
wearing
but
people
used
believe
there
were
such
things
the
Blibbering
Humdinger
the
Crumple
Horned
Snorkack
Well
they
were
right
weren
they
said
Hermione
impatiently
Thereweren
tany
such
things
the
Blibbering
Humdinger
the
Crumple
Horned
Snorkack
Luna
gave
her
withering
look
and
flounced
away
radishes
swinging
madly
Parvati
and
Lavender
were
not
the
only
ones
hooting
with
laughter
now
you
mind
not
offending
the
only
people
who
believe
Harry
asked
Hermione
they
made
their
way
into
class
for
heaven
sake
Harry
you
can
better
thanher
said
Hermione
Ginny
told
all
about
her
apparently
she
only
believe
things
long
there
proof
all
Well
wouldn
expect
anything
else
from
someone
whose
father
runsThe
Quibbler
Harry
thought
the
sinister
winged
horses
had
seen
the
night
had
arrived
and
how
Luna
had
said
she
could
see
them
too
His
spirits
sank
slightly
Had
she
been
lying
But
before
could
devote
much
more
thought
the
matter
Ernie
Macmillan
had
stepped
him
want
you
know
Potter
said
loud
carrying
voice
that
not
only
weirdos
who
support
you
personally
believe
you
one
hundred
per
cent
family
have
always
stood
firm
behind
Dumbledore
and
thanks
very
much
Ernie
said
Harry
taken
aback
but
pleased
Ernie
might
pompous
occasions
like
this
but
Harry
was
mood
deeply
appreciate
vote
confidence
from
somebody
who
did
not
have
radishes
dangling
from
their
ears
Ernie
words
had
certainly
wiped
the
smile
from
Lavender
Brown
face
and
turned
talk
Ron
and
Hermione
Harry
caught
Seamus
expression
which
looked
both
confused
and
defiant
nobody
surprise
Professor
Sprout
started
their
lesson
lecturing
them
about
the
importance
Harry
wished
all
the
teachers
would
stop
doing
this
was
starting
get
anxious
twisted
feeling
his
stomach
every
time
remembered
how
much
homework
had
feeling
that
worsened
dramatically
when
Professor
Sprout
gave
them
yet
another
essay
the
end
class
Tired
and
smelling
strongly
dragon
dung
Professor
Sprout
preferred
type
fertiliser
the
Gryffindors
trooped
back
the
castle
hour
and
half
later
none
them
talking
very
much
had
been
another
long
day
Harry
was
starving
and
had
his
first
detention
with
Umbridge
five
clock
headed
straight
for
dinner
without
dropping
off
his
bag
Gryffindor
Tower
that
could
bolt
something
down
before
facing
whatever
she
had
store
for
him
had
barely
reached
the
entrance
the
Great
Hall
however
when
loud
and
angry
voice
yelled
Potter
What
now
muttered
wearily
turning
face
Angelina
Johnson
who
looked
though
she
was
towering
temper
tell
youwhat
now
she
said
marching
straight
him
and
poking
him
hard
the
chest
with
her
finger
How
come
you
landed
yourself
detention
for
five
clock
Friday
What
said
Harry
Why
yeah
Keeper
tryouts
Now
remembers
snarled
Angelina
Didn
tell
you
wanted
tryout
with
thewhole
team
and
find
someone
whofitted
with
everyone
Didn
tell
you
booked
the
Quidditch
pitch
specially
And
now
you
decided
you
not
going
there
didn
decide
not
there
said
Harry
stung
the
injustice
these
words
got
detention
from
that
Umbridge
woman
just
because
told
her
the
truth
about
You
Know
Who
Well
you
can
just
straight
her
and
ask
her
let
you
off
Friday
said
Angelina
fiercely
and
don
care
how
you
Tell
her
You
Know
Who
figment
your
imagination
you
like
justmake
sure
you
there
She
turned
her
heel
and
stormed
away
You
know
what
Harry
said
Ron
and
Hermione
they
entered
the
Great
Hall
think
better
check
with
Puddlemere
United
whether
Oliver
Wood
been
killed
during
training
session
because
Angelina
seems
channelling
his
spirit
What
you
reckon
are
the
odds
Umbridge
letting
you
off
Friday
said
Ron
sceptically
they
sat
down
the
Gryffindor
table
Less
than
zero
said
Harry
glumly
tipping
lamb
chops
his
plate
and
starting
eat
Better
try
though
hadn
offer
two
more
detentions
something
dunno
swallowed
mouthful
potato
and
added
hope
she
doesn
keep
too
long
this
evening
You
realise
got
write
three
essays
practise
Vanishing
Spells
for
McGonagall
work
out

the
Bowtruckle

for
Trelawney
Ron
moaned
and
for
some
reason
glanced
the
ceiling
And
looks
like
going
rain
What
that
got
with
our
homework
said
Hermione
her
eyebrows
raised
Nothing
said
Ron
once
his
ears
reddening
five
five
Harry
bade
the
other
two
goodbye
and
set
off
for
Umbridge
office
the
third
floor
When
knocked
the
door
she
called
Come
sugary
voice
entered
cautiously
looking
around
had
known
this
office
under
three
its
previous
occupants
the
days
when
Gilderoy
Lockhart
had
lived
here
had
been
plastered
beaming
portraits
himself
When
Lupin
had
occupied
was
likely
you
would
meet
some
fascinating
Dark
creature
cage
tank
you
came
call
the
impostor
Moody
days
had
been
packed
with
various
instruments
and
artefacts
for
the
detection
wrongdoing
and
concealment
Now
however
looked
totally
unrecognisable
The
surfaces
had
all
been
draped
lacy
covers
and
cloths
There
were
several
vases
full
dried
flowers
each
one
residing
its
own
doily
and
one
the
walls
was
collection
ornamental
plates
each
decorated
with
large
technicolour
kitten
wearing
different
bow
around
its
neck
These
were
foul
that
Harry
stared
them
transfixed
until
Professor
Umbridge
spoke
again
Good
evening
Potter
Harry
started
and
looked
around
had
not
noticed
her
first
because
she
was
wearing
luridly
flowered
set
robes
that
blended
only
too
well
with
the
tablecloth
the
desk
behind
her
Evening
Professor
Umbridge
Harry
said
stiffly
Well
sit
down
she
said
pointing
towards
small
table
draped
lace
beside
which
she
had
drawn
straight
backed
chair
piece
blank
parchment
lay
the
table
apparently
waiting
for
him
said
Harry
without
moving
Professor
Umbridge
before
start
wanted
ask
you
favour
Her
bulging
eyes
narrowed
yes
Well
the
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
And
was
supposed
the
tryouts
for
the
new
Keeper
five
clock
Friday
and
was
was
wondering
whether
could
skip
detention
that
night
and
another
night
instead
knew
long
before
reached
the
end
his
sentence
that
was
good
said
Umbridge
smiling
widely
that
she
looked
though
she
had
just
swallowed
particularly
juicy
fly
This
your
punishment
for
spreading
evil
nasty
attention
seeking
stories
Potter
and
punishments
certainly
cannot
adjusted
suit
the
guilty
one
convenience
you
will
come
here
five
clock
tomorrow
and
the
next
day
and
Friday
too
and
you
will
your
detentions
planned
think
rather
good
thing
that
you
are
missing
something
you
really
want
ought
reinforce
the
lesson
trying
teach
you
Harry
felt
the
blood
surge
his
head
and
heard
thumping
noise
his
ears
told
evil
nasty
attention
seeking
stories
did
She
was
watching
him
with
her
head
slightly
one
side
still
smiling
widely
though
she
knew
exactly
what
was
thinking
and
was
waiting
see
whether
would
start
shouting
again
With
massive
effort
Harry
looked
away
from
her
dropped
his
schoolbag
beside
the
straight
backed
chair
and
sat
down
There
said
Umbridge
sweetly
getting
better
controlling
our
temper
already
aren
Now
you
are
going
doing
some
lines
for
Potter
not
with
your
quill
she
added
Harry
bent
down
open
his
bag
You
going
using
rather
special
one
mine
Here
you
are
She
handed
him
long
thin
black
quill
with
unusually
sharp
point
want
you
write
must
not
tell
lies
she
told
him
softly
How
many
times
Harry
asked
with
creditable
imitation
politeness
long
takes
for
the
message
tosink
said
Umbridge
sweetly
Off
you
She
moved
over
her
desk
sat
down
and
bent
over
stack
parchment
that
looked
like
essays
for
marking
Harry
raised
the
sharp
black
quill
then
realised
what
was
missing
You
haven
given
any
ink
said
you
won
need
ink
said
Professor
Umbridge
with
the
merest
suggestion
laugh
her
voice
Harry
placed
the
point
the
quill
the
paper
and
wrote
must
not
tell
lies
let
out
gasp
pain
The
words
had
appeared
the
parchment
what
appeared
shining
red
ink
the
same
time
the
words
had
appeared
the
back
Harry
right
hand
cut
into
his
skin
though
traced
there
scalpel
yet
even
stared
the
shining
cut
the
skin
healed
over
again
leaving
the
place
where
had
been
slightly
redder
than
before
but
quite
smooth
Harry
looked
round
Umbridge
She
was
watching
him
her
wide
toadlike
mouth
stretched
smile
Yes
Nothing
said
Harry
quietly
looked
back
the
parchment
placed
the
quill
once
more
wroteI
must
not
tell
lies
and
felt
the
searing
pain
the
back
his
hand
for
second
time
once
again
the
words
had
been
cut
into
his
skin
once
again
they
healed
over
seconds
later
And
went
Again
and
again
Harry
wrote
the
words
the
parchment
what
soon
came
realise
was
not
ink
but
his
own
blood
And
again
and
again
the
words
were
cut
into
the
back
his
hand
healed
and
reappeared
the
next
time
set
quill
parchment
Darkness
fell
outside
Umbridge
window
Harry
did
not
ask
when
would
allowed
stop
did
not
even
check
his
watch
knew
she
was
watching
him
for
signs
weakness
and
was
not
going
show
any
not
even
had
sit
there
all
night
cutting
open
his
own
hand
with
this
quill
Come
here
she
said
after
what
seemed
hours
stood
His
hand
was
stinging
painfully
When
looked
down
saw
that
the
cut
had
healed
but
that
the
skin
there
was
red
raw
Hand
she
said
extended
She
took
her
own
Harry
repressed
shudder
she
touched
him
with
her
thick
stubby
fingers
which
she
wore
number
ugly
old
rings
Tut
tut
don
seem
have
made
much
impression
yet
she
said
smiling
Well
just
have
try
again
tomorrow
evening
won
You
may
Harry
left
her
office
without
word
The
school
was
quite
deserted
was
surely
past
midnight
walked
slowly
the
corridor
then
when
had
turned
the
corner
and
was
sure
she
would
not
hear
him
broke
into
run
had
not
had
time
practise
Vanishing
Spells
had
not
written
single
dream
his
dream
diary
and
had
not
finished
the
drawing
the
Bowtruckle
nor
had
written
his
essays
skipped
breakfast
next
morning
scribble
down
couple
made
dreams
for
Divination
their
first
lesson
and
was
surprised
find
dishevelled
Ron
keeping
him
company
How
come
you
didn
last
night
Harry
asked
Ron
stared
wildly
around
the
common
room
for
inspiration
Ron
who
had
been
fast
asleep
when
Harry
got
back
the
dormitory
muttered
something
about
doing
other
stuff
bent
low
over
his
parchment
and
scrawled
few
words
That
have
said
slamming
the
diary
shut
said
dreamed
was
buying
new
pair
shoes
she
can
make
anything
weird
out
that
can
she
They
hurried
off
North
Tower
together
How
was
detention
with
Umbridge
anyway
What
did
she
make
you
Harry
hesitated
for
fraction
second
then
said
Lines
That
not
too
bad
then
said
Ron
Nope
said
Harry
Hey
forgot
did
she
let
you
off
for
Friday
said
Harry
Ron
groaned
sympathetically
was
another
bad
day
for
Harry
was
one
the
worst
Transfiguration
not
having
practised
Vanishing
Spells
all
had
give
his
lunch
hour
complete
the
picture
the
Bowtruckle
and
meanwhile
Professors
McGonagall
Grubbly
Plank
and
Sinistra
gave
them
yet
more
homework
which
had
prospect
finishing
that
evening
because
his
second
detention
with
Umbridge
cap
all
Angelina
Johnson
tracked
him
down
dinner
again
and
learning
that
would
not
able
attend
Friday
Keeper
tryouts
told
him
she
was
not
all
impressed
his
attitude
and
that
she
expected
players
who
wished
remain
the
team
put
training
before
their
other
commitments
detention
Harry
yelled
after
her
she
stalked
away

think
rather
stuck

with
that
old
toad
playing
Quidditch
least
only
lines
said
Hermione
consolingly
Harry
sank
back
his
bench
and
looked
down
his
steak
and
kidney
pie
which
longer
fancied
very
much
not
dreadful
punishment
really
Harry
opened
his
mouth
closed
again
and
nodded
was
not
really
sure
why
was
not
telling
Ron
and
Hermione
exactly
what
was
happening
Umbridge
room
only
knew
that
did
not
want
see
their
looks
horror
that
would
make
the
whole
thing
seem
worse
and
therefore
more
difficult
face
also
felt
dimly
that
this
was
between
himself
and
Umbridge
private
battle
wills
and
was
not
going
give
her
the
satisfaction
hearing
that
had
complained
about
can
believe
how
much
homework
got
said
Ron
miserably
Well
why
didn
you
any
last
night
Hermione
asked
him
Where
were
you
anyway
was
fancied
walk
said
Ron
shiftily
Harry
had
the
distinct
impression
that
was
not
alone
concealing
things
the
moment
The
second
detention
was
just
bad
the
previous
one
The
skin
the
back
Harry
hand
became
irritated
more
quickly
now
and
was
soon
red
and
inflamed
Harry
thought
unlikely
that
would
keep
healing
effectively
for
long
Soon
the
cut
would
remain
etched
into
his
hand
and
Umbridge
would
perhaps
satisfied
let
gasp
pain
escape
him
however
and
from
themoment
entering
the
room
the
moment
his
dismissal
again
past
midnight
said
nothing
but
good
evening
and
goodnight
His
homework
situation
however
was
now
desperate
and
when
returned
the
Gryffindor
common
room
did
not
though
exhausted
bed
but
opened
his
books
and
began
Snape
moonstone
essay
was
half
past
two
the
time
had
finished
knew
had
done
poor
job
but
there
was
help
for
unless
had
something
give
would
detention
with
Snape
next
then
dashed
off
answers
the
questions
Professor
McGonagall
had
set
them
cobbled
together
something
the
proper
handling
Bowtruckles
for
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
and
staggered
bed
where
fell
fully
clothed
top
the
covers
and
fell
asleep
immediately
Thursday
passed
haze
tiredness
Ron
seemed
very
sleepy
too
though
Harry
could
not
see
why
should
Harry
third
detention
passed
the
same
way
the
previous
two
except
that
after
two
hours
the
words
must
not
tell
lies
did
not
fade
from
the
back
Harry
hand
but
remained
scratched
there
oozing
droplets
blood
The
pause
the
pointed
quill
scratching
made
Professor
Umbridge
look
she
said
softly
moving
around
her
desk
examine
his
hand
herself
Good
That
ought
serve
reminder
you
oughtn
You
may
leave
for
tonight
still
have
come
back
tomorrow
said
Harry
picking
his
schoolbag
with
his
left
hand
rather
than
his
smarting
right
one
yes
said
Professor
Umbridge
smiling
widely
before
Yes
think
can
etch
the
message
little
deeper
with
another
evening
work
Harry
had
never
before
considered
the
possibility
that
there
might
another
teacher
the
world
hated
more
than
Snape
but
walked
back
towards
Gryffindor
Tower
had
admit
had
found
strong
contender
She
evil
thought
climbed
staircase
the
seventh
floor
she
evil
twisted
mad
old
Ron
had
reached
the
top
the
stairs
turned
right
and
almost
walked
into
Ron
who
was
lurking
behind
statue
Lachlan
the
Lanky
clutching
his
broomstick
gave
great
leap
surprise
when
saw
Harry
and
attempted
hide
his
new
Cleansweep
Eleven
behind
his
back
What
are
you
doing
nothing
What
areyou
doing
Harry
frowned
him
Come
you
can
tell
What
are
you
hiding
here
for
hiding
from
Fred
and
George
you
must
know
said
Ron
They
just
went
past
with
bunch
first
years
bet
they
testing
stuff
them
again
mean
they
can
the
common
room
now
can
they
not
with
Hermione
there
was
talking
very
fast
feverish
way
But

have

got
your
broom
for
you
haven
been
flying
have
you
Harry
asked
well
well
tell
you
but
don
laugh
all
right
Ron
said
defensively
turning
redder
with
every
second
thought
try
out
for
Gryffindor
Keeper
now
got
decent
broom
There
Laugh
not
laughing
said
Harry
Ron
blinked
brilliant
idea
really
cool
you
got
the
team
never
seen
you
play
Keeper
are
you
good
not
bad
said
Ron
who
looked
immensely
relieved
Harry
reaction
Charlie
Fred
and
George
always
made
Keep
for
them
when
they
were
training
during
the
holidays

practising
tonight
Every
evening
since
Tuesday
just
own
though
been
trying
bewitch
Quaffles
fly
but
hasn
been
easy
and
don
know
how
much
use
Ron
looked
nervous
and
anxious
Fred
and
George
are
going
laugh
themselves
stupid
when
turn
for
the
tryouts
They
haven
stopped
taking
the
mickey
out
since
got
made
prefect
wish
was
going
there
said
Harry
bitterly
they
set
off
together
towards
the
common
room
Yeah
Harry
what
that
the
back
your
hand
Harry
who
had
just
scratched
his
nose
with
his
free
right
hand
tried
hide
but
had
much
success
Ron
with
his
Cleansweep
just
cut
nothing
But
Ron
had
grabbed
Harry
forearm
and
pulled
the
back
Harry
hand
level
with
his
eyes
There
was
pause
during
which
stared
the
words
carved
into
the
skin
then
looking
sick
released
Harry
thought
you
said
she
was
just
giving
you
lines
Harry
hesitated
but
after
all
Ron
had
been
honest
with
him
told
Ron
the
truth
about
the
hours
had
been
spending
Umbridge
office
The
old
hag
Ron
said
revolted
whisper
they
came
halt
front
the
Fat
Lady
who
was
dozing
peacefully
with
her
head
against
her
frame
She
sick
McGonagall
say
something
said
Harry
once
not
giving
her
the
satisfaction
knowing
she
got
Got
you
You
can
let
her
get
away
with
this
don
know
how
much
power
McGonagall
got
over
her
said
Harry
Dumbledore
then
tell
Dumbledore
said
Harry
flatly
Why
not
got
enough
his
mind
said
Harry
but
that
was
not
the
true
reason
was
not
going
Dumbledore
for
help
when
Dumbledore
had
not
spoken
him
once
since
June
Well
reckon
you
should
Ron
began
but
was
interrupted
the
Fat
Lady
who
had
been
watching
them
sleepily
and
now
burst
out
Are
you
going
give
the
password
will
have
stay
awake
all
night
waiting
for
you
finish
your
conversation
Friday
dawned
sullen
and
sodden
the
rest
the
week
Though
Harry
automatically
glanced
towards
the
staff
table
when
entered
the
Great
Hall
was
without
any
real
hope
seeing
Hagrid
and
turned
his
mind
immediately
his
more
pressing
problems
such
the
mountainous
pile
homework
had
and
the
prospect
yet
another
detention
with
Umbridge
Two
things
sustained
Harry
that
day
One
was
the
thought
that
was
almost
the
weekend
the
other
was
that
dreadful
though
his
final
detention
with
Umbridge
was
sure
had
distant
view
the
Quidditch
pitch
from
her
window
and
might
with
luck
able
see
something
Ron
tryout
These
were
rather
feeble
rays
light
was
true
but
Harry
was
grateful
for
anything
that
might
lighten
his
present
darkness
had
never
had
worse
first
week
term
Hogwarts
five
clock
that
evening
knocked
Professor
Umbridge
office
door
for
what
sincerely
hoped
would
the
final
time
and
was
told
enter
The
blank
parchment
lay
ready
for
him
the
lace
covered
table
the
pointed
black
quill
beside
You
know
what
Potter
said
Umbridge
smiling
sweetly
him
Harry
picked
the
quill
and
glanced
through
the
window
just
shifted
his
chair
inch
the
right
the
pretext
shifting
himself
closer
the
table
managed
now
had
distant
view
the
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
soaring
and
down
the
pitch
while
half
dozen
black
figures
stood
the
foot
the
three
high
goalposts
apparently
awaiting
their
turn
Keep
was
impossible
tell
which
one
was
Ron
this
distance
must
not
tell
lies
Harry
wrote
The
cut
the
back
his
right
hand
opened
and
began
bleed
atresh
must
not
tell
lies
The
cut
dug
deeper
stinging
and
smarting
must
not
tell
lies
Blood
trickled
down
his
wrist
chanced
another
glance
out
the
window
Whoever
was
defending
the
goalposts
now
was
doing
very
poor
job
indeed
Katie
Bell
scored
twice
the
few
seconds
Harry
dared
watch
Hoping
very
much
that
the
Keeper
wasn
Ron
dropped
his
eyes
back
the
parchment
shining
with
blood
must
not
tell
lies
must
not
tell
lies
looked
whenever
thought
could
risk
when
could
hear
the
scratching
Umbridge
quill
the
opening
desk
drawer
The
third
person
try
out
was
pretty
good
the
fourth
was
terrible
the
fifth
dodged
Bludger
exceptionally
well
but
then
fumbled
easy
save
The
sky
was
darkening
and
Harry
doubted
would
able
see
the
sixth
and
seventh
people
all
must
not
tell
lies
must
not
tell
lies
The
parchment
was
now
dotted
with
drops
blood
from
the
back
his
hand
which
was
searing
with
pain
When
next
looked
night
had
fallen
and
the
Quidditch
pitch
was
longer
visible
Let
see
you
got
the
message
yet
shall
said
Umbridges
soft
voice
half
hour
later
She
moved
towards
him
stretching
out
her
short
ringed
fingers
for
his
arm
And
then
she
took
hold
him
examine
the
words
now
cut
into
his
skin
pain
seared
not
across
the
back
his
hand
but
across
the
scar
his
forehead
the
same
time
had
most
peculiar
sensation
somewhere
around
his
midriff
wrenched
his
arm
out
her
grip
and
leapt
his
feet
staring
her
She
looked
back
him
smile
stretching
her
wide
slack
mouth
Yes
hurts
doesn
she
said
softly
did
not
answer
His
heart
was
thumping
very
hard
and
fast
Was
she
talking
about
his
hand
did
she
know
what
had
just
felt
his
forehead
Well
think
made
point
Potter
You
may
caught
his
schoolbag
and
left
the
room
quickly
could
Stay
calm
told
himself
sprinted
the
stairs
Stay
calm
doesn
necessarily
mean
what
you
think
means
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
gasped
the
Fat
Lady
who
swung
forwards
once
more
roar
sound
greeted
him
Ron
came
running
towards
him
beaming
all
over
his
face
and
slopping
Butterbeer
down
his
front
from
the
goblet
was
clutching
Harry
did
Keeper
What
brilliant
said
Harry
trying
smile
naturally
while
his
heart
continued
race
and
his
hand
throbbed
and
bled
Have
Butterbeer
Ron
pressed
bottle
him
can
believe
where
Hermione
gone
She
there
said
Fred
who
was
also
swigging
Butterbeer
and
pointed
armchair
the
fire
Hermione
was
dozing
her
drink
tipping
precariously
her
hand
Well
she
said
she
was
pleased
when
told
her
said
Ron
looking
slightly
put
out
Let
her
sleep
said
George
hastily
was
few
moments
before
Harry
noticed
that
several
the
first
years
gathered
around
them
bore
unmistakeable
signs
recent
nosebleeds
Come
here
Ron
and
see
Oliver
old
robes
fit
you
called
Katie
Bell
can
take
off
his
name
and
put
yours
instead
Ron
moved
away
Angelina
came
striding
Harry
Sorry
was
bit
short
with
you
earlier
Potter
she
said
abruptly
stressful
this
managing
lark
you
know
starting
think
was
bit
hard
Wood
sometimes
She
was
watching
Ron
over
the
rim
her
goblet
with
slight
frown
her
face
Look
know
your
best
mate
but
not
fabulous
she
said
bluntly
think
with
bit
training
all
right
though
comes
from
family
good
Quidditch
players
banking
him
turning
out
have
bit
more
talent
than
showed
today
honest
VickyFrobisher
and
Geoffrey
Hooper
both
flew
better
this
evening
but
Hooper
real
whiner
always
moaning
about
something
other
and
Vicky
involved
all
sorts
societies
She
admitted
herself
that
training
clashed
with
her
Charms
Club
she
put
Charms
first
Anyway
having
practice
session
two
clock
tomorrow
just
make
sure
you
there
this
time
And

and
help
Ron

can
nodded
and
Angelina
strolled
back
Alicia
Spinnet
Harry
moved
over
sit
next
Hermione
who
awoke
with
jerk
put
down
his
bag
Harry
you
good
about
Ron
isn
she
said
blearily
just
tired
she
yawned
was
until
one
clock
making
more
hats
They
disappearing
like
mad
And
sure
enough
now
that
looked
Harry
saw
that
there
were
woolly
hats
concealed
all
around
the
room
where
unwary
elves
might
accidentally
pick
them
Great
said
Harry
distractedly
did
not
tell
somebody
soon
would
burst
Listen
Hermione
was
just
Umbridge
office
and
she
touched
arm
Hermione
listened
closely
When
Harry
had
finished
she
said
slowly
You
worried
You
Know
Who
controlling
her
like
controlled
Quirrell
Well
said
Harry
dropping
his
voice
possibility
isn
suppose
said
Hermione
though
she
sounded
unconvinced
But
don
think
can
possessing
her
the
way
possessed
Quirrell
mean
properly
alive
again
now
isn
got
his
own
body
wouldn
need
share
someone
else
could
have
her
under
the
Imperius
Curse
suppose
Harry
watched
Fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
juggling
empty
Butterbeer
bottles
for
moment
Then
Hermione
said
But
last
year
your
scar
hurt
when
nobody
was
touching
you
and
didn
Dumbledore
say
had
with
what
You
Know
Who
was
feeling
the
time
mean
maybe
this
hasn
got
anything
with
Umbridge
all
maybe
just
coincidence
happened
while
you
were
with
her
She
evil
said
Harry
flatly
Twisted
She
horrible

but
Harry
think
you
ought
tell
Dumbledore
your
scar
hurt
was
the
second
time
two
days
had
been
advised
Dumbledore
and
his
answer
Hermione
was
just
the
same
his
answer
Ron
not
bothering
him
with
this
Like
you
just
said
its
not
big
deal

hurting
and
off
all
summer
was
just
bit
worse

all
Harry

Harry
before
could
stop
himself
that
the
only
bit
Dumbledore
cares
about
isn
scar
Don

not
true
think

tell
Sirius

Harry

Hermione
looking
alarmed
Don

remember
Moody

careful
what

writing
just
can
guarantee
owls
aren
being
intercepted

more
All

then
said
Harry
irritably
got
his
feet
going
bed
Tell
Ron

will

said
Hermione
looking
relieved
you
going
that
means

Listen

Harry
looked
into
her
face
which
was
shining
with
glee
and
tried
look
though
was
vaguely
tempted
this
offer
don
think
will
thanks
said
not
tomorrow
got
loads
homework
And
traipsed
off
the
boys
stairs
leaving
her
looking
slightly
disappointed
PERCY
AND
PADFOOT
Harry
was
first
wake
his
dormitory
next
morning
lay
for
moment
watching
dust
swirl
the
ray
sunlight
coming
through
the
gap
his
four
poster
hangings
and
savoured
the
thought
that
was
Saturday
The
first
week
term
seemed
have
dragged
for
ever
like
one
gigantic
History
Magic
lesson
Judging
the
sleepy
silence
and
the
freshly
minted
look
that
beam
sunlight
was
just
after
daybreak
pulled
open
the
curtains
around
his
bed
got
and
started
dress
The
only
sound
apart
from
the
distant
twittering
birds
was
the
slow
deep
breathing
his
fellow
Gryffindors
opened
his
schoolbag
carefully
pulled
out
parchment
and
quill
and
headed
out
the
dormitory
for
the
common
room
Making
straight
for
his
favourite
squashy
old
armchair
beside
the
now
extinct
fire
Harry
settled
himself
down
comfortably
and
unrolled
his
parchment
while
looking
around
the
room
The
detritus
crumpled
bits
parchment
old
Gobstones
empty
ingredient
jars
and
sweet
wrappers
that
usually
covered
the
common
room
the
end
each
day
was
gone
were
all
Hermione
elf
hats
Wondering
vaguely
how
many
elves
had
now
been
set
free
whether
they
wanted
not
Harry
uncorked
his
ink
bottle
dipped
his
quill
into
then
held
suspended
inch
above
the
smooth
yellowish
surface
his
parchment
thinking
hard
but
after
minute
found
himself
staring
into
the
empty
grate
complete
loss
for
what
say
could
now
appreciate
how
hard
had
been
for
Ron
and
Hermione
write
him
letters
over
the
summer
How
was
supposed
tell
Sirius
everything
that
had
happened
over
the
past
week
and
pose
all
the
questions
was
burning
ask
without
giving
potential
letter
thieves
lot
information
did
not
want
them
have
sat
quite
motionless
for
while
gazing
into
the
fireplace
then
finally
coming
decision
dipped
his
quill
into
the
ink
bottle
once
more
and
set
resolutely
the
parchment
Dear
Snuffles
Hope
you
the
first
week
back
here
been
terrible
really
glad
the
weekend
got
new
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
Professor
Umbridge
She
nearly
nice
your
mum
writing
because
that
thing
wrote
you
about
last
summer
happened
again
last
night
when
was
doing
detention
with
Umbridge
all
missing
our
biggest
friend
hope
back
soon
Please
write
back
quickly
Best
Harry
Harry
reread
the
letter
several
times
trying
see
from
the
point
view
outsider
could
not
see
how
they
would
know
what
was
talking
about
who
was
talking
just
from
reading
this
letter
did
hope
Sirius
would
pick
the
hint
about
Hagrid
and
tell
them
when
might
back
Harry
did
not
want
ask
directly
case
drew
too
much
attention
what
Hagrid
might
while
was
not
Hogwarts
Considering
was
very
short
letter
had
taken
long
time
write
sunlight
had
crept
halfway
across
the
room
while
had
been
working
and
could
now
hear
distant
sounds
movement
from
the
dormitories
above
Sealing
the
parchment
carefully
climbed
through
the
portrait
hole
and
headed
off
for
the

Nearly
Headless
Nick
drifting
disconcertingly
through
wall
just
ahead
Harry
walked
down
the
passage
Peeves
planning
amusing
joke
the
next
person
pass
the
bust
Paracelsus
halfway
down
the
corridor
Does
involve
Paracelsus

Harry
Funnily

Nearly
Headless

Subtlety

Peeves

Bloody
Baron
might
able
put
stop
see
you
Harry
Yeah
bye
said
Harry
and
instead
turning
right
turned
left
taking
longer
but
safer
route
the
Owlery
His
spirits
rose
walked
past
window
after
window
showing
brilliantly
blue
sky
had
training
later
would
back
the
Quidditch
pitch
last
Something
brushed
his
ankles
looked
down
and
saw
the
caretaker
skeletal
grey
cat
Mrs
Norris
slinking
past
him
She
turned
lamplike
yellow
eyes
him
for
moment
before
disappearing
behind
statue
Wilfred
the
Wistful
not
doing
anything
wrong
Harry
called
after
her
She
had
the
unmistakeable
air
cat
that
was
off
report
her
boss
yet
Harry
could
not
see
why
was
perfectly
entitled
walk
the
Owlery
Saturday
morning
The
sun
was
high
the
sky
now
and
when
Harry
entered
the
Owlery
the
glassless
windows
dazzled
his
eyes
thick
silvery
beams
sunlight
crisscrossed
the
circular
room
which
hundreds
owls
nestled
rafters
little
restless
the
early
morning
light
some
clearly
just
returned
from
hunting
The
straw
covered
floor
crunched
little
stepped
across
tiny
animal
bones
craning
his
neck
for
sight
Hedwig
There
you
are
said
spotting
her
somewhere
near
the
very
top
the
vaulted
ceiling
Get
down
here
got
letter
for
you
With
low
hoot
she
stretched
her
great
white
wings
and
soared
down
his
shoulder
Right
know
this
says
Snuffles
the
outside
told
her
giving
her
the
letter
clasp
her
beak
and
without
knowing
exactly
why
whispering
but
for
Sirius
She
blinked
her
amber
eyes
once
and
took
that
mean
that
she
understood
Safe
flight
then
said
Harry
and
carried
her
one
the
windows
with
moment
pressure
his
arm
Hedwig
took
off
into
the
blindingly
bright
sky
watched
her
until
she
became
tiny
black
speck
and
vanished
then
switched
his
gaze
Hagrid
hut
clearly
visible
from
this
window
and
just
clearly
uninhabited
the
chimney
smokeless
the
curtains
drawn
The
treetops
the
Forbidden
Forest
swayed
light
breeze
Harry
watched
them
savouring
the
fresh
air
his
face
thinking
about
Quidditch
later
then
saw
great
reptilian
winged
horse
just
like
the
ones
pulling
the
Hogwarts
carriages
with
leathery
black
wings
spread
wide
like
pterodactyl
rose
out
the
trees
like
grotesque
giant
bird
soared
great
circle
then
plunged
back
into
the
trees
The
whole
thinghad
happened
quickly
Harry
could
hardly
believe
what
had
seen
except
that
his
heart
was
hammering
madly
The
Owlery
door
opened
behind
him
leapt
shock
and
turning
quickly
saw
Cho
Chang
holding
letter
and
parcel
her
hands
said
Harry
automatically
she
said
breathlessly
didn
think
anyone
would
here
this
early
only
remembered
five
minutes
ago
mum
birthday
She
held
the
parcel
Right
said
Harry
His
brain
seemed
have
jammed
wanted
say
something
funny
and
interesting
but
the
memory
that
terrible
winged
horse
was
fresh
his
mind
Nice
day
said
gesturing
the
windows
His
insides
seemed
shrivel
with
embarrassment
The
weather
was
talking
about
theweather
Yeah
said
Cho
looking
around
for
suitable
owl
Good
Quidditch
conditions
haven
been
out
all
week
have
you
said
Harry
Cho
had
selected
one
the
school
barn
owls
She
coaxed
down
her
arm
where
held
out
obliging
leg
that
she
could
attach
the
parcel
Hey
has
Gryffindor
got
new
Keeper
yet
she
asked
Yeah
said
Harry
friend
Ron
Weasley
you
know
him
The
Tornados
hater
said
Cho
rather
coolly
any
good
Yeah
said
Harry
think
didn
see
his
tryout
though
was
detention
Cho
looked
the
parcel
only
half
attached
the
owl
legs
That
Umbridge
woman
foul
she
said
low
voice
Putting
you
detention
just
because
you
told
the
truth
about
how
how
how
died
Everyone
heard
about
was
all
over
the
school
You
were
really
brave
standing
her
like
that
Harry
insides
inflated
rapidly
felt
though
might
actually
float
few
inches
off
the
dropping
strewn
floor
Who
cared
about
stupid
flying
horse
Cho
thought
had
been
really
brave
For
moment
considered
accidentally
purpose
showing
her
his
cut
hand
helped
her
tie
her
parcel
her
owl
but
the
very
instant
this
thrilling
thought
occurred
the
Owlery
door
opened
again
Filch
the
caretaker
came
wheezing
into
the
room
There
were
purple
patches
his
sunken
veined
cheeks
his
jowls
were
aquiver
and
his
thin
grey
hair
dishevelled
had
obviously
run
here
Mrs
Norris
came
trotting
his
heels
gazing
the
owls
overhead
and
mewing
hungrily
There
was
restless
shifting
wings
from
above
and
large
brown
owl
snapped
his
beak
menacing
fashion
Aha
said
Filch
taking
flat
footed
step
towards
Harry
his
pouchy
cheeks
trembling
with
anger
had
tip
off
that
you
are
intending
place
massive
order
for
Dungbombs
Harry
folded
his
arms
and
stared
the
caretaker
Who
told
you
was
ordering
Dungbombs
Cho
was
looking
from
Harry
Filch
also
frowning
the
barn
owl
her
arm
tired
standing
one
leg
gave
admonitory
hoot
but
she
ignored
have
sources
said
Filch
self
satisfied
hiss
Now
hand
over
whatever
you
sending
Feeling
immensely
thankful
that
had
not
dawdled
posting
off
the
letter
Harry
said
can
gone
Gone
said
Filch
his
face
contorting
with
rage
Gone
said
Harry
calmly
Filch
opened
his
mouth
furiously
mouthed
for
few
seconds
then
raked
Harry
robes
with
his
eyes
How
know
you
haven
got
your
pocket
Because
saw
him
send
said
Cho
angrily
Filch
rounded
her
You
saw
him
That
right
saw
him
she
said
fiercely
There
was
moment
pause
which
Filch
glared
Cho
and
Cho
glared
right
back
then
the
caretaker
turned
his
heel
and
shuffled
back
towards
the
door
stopped
with
his
hand
the
handle
and
looked
back
Harry
get
much
whiff
Dungbomb
stumped
off
down
the
stairs
Mrs
Norris
cast
last
longing
look
the
owls
and
followed
him
Harry
and
Cho
looked
each
other
Thanks
Harry
said
problem
said
Cho
finally
fixing
the
parcel
the
barn
owl
other
leg
her
face
slightly
pink
Youweren
tordering
Dungbombs
were
you
said
Harry
wonder
why
thought
you
were
then
she
said
she
carried
the
owl
the
window
Harry
shrugged
was
quite
mystified
bythat
she
was
though
oddly
was
not
bothering
him
very
much
the
moment
They
left
the
Owlery
together
the
entrance
corridor
that
led
towards
the
west
wing
the
castle
Cho
said
going
thisway
Well
see
you
around
Harry
Yeah
see
you
She
smiled
him
and
departed
Harry
walked
feeling
quietly
elated
had
managed
have
entire
conversation
with
her
and
not
embarrassed
himself
once
you
were
really
brave
standing
her
like
that
Cho
had
called
him
brave
she
did
not
hate
him
for
being
alive
course
she
had
preferred
Cedric
knew
that
though
only
asked
her
the
Ball
before
Cedric
had
things
might
have
turned
out
differently
she
had
seemed
sincerely
sorry
that
she
had
refuse
when
Harry
asked
her
Morning
Harry
said
brightly
Ron
and
Hermione
joined
them
the
Gryffindor
table
the
Great
Hall
What
are
you
looking
pleased
about
said
Ron
eyeing
Harry
surprise
Erm
Quidditch
later
said
Harry
happily
pulling
large
platter
bacon
and
eggs
towards
him
yeah
said
Ron
put
down
the
piece
toast
was
eating
and
took
large
swig
pumpkin
juice
Then
said
Listen

don
fancy
going
out
bit
earlier
with
you
Just

some
practice
before

know
get
eye
bit
Yeah
said
Harry
Look

think
you

said
Hermione
seriously
You
both
really
behind
homework
But
she
broke
off
the
morning
post
was
arriving
and
usual
theDaily
Prophet
was
soaring
towards
her
the
beak
screech
owl
which
landed
perilously
close
the
sugar
bowl
and
held
out
leg
Hermione
pushed
Knut
into
its
leather
pouch
took
the
newspaper
and
scanned
the
front
page
critically
the
owl
took
off
Anything
interesting
said
Ron
Harry
grinned
knowing
Ron
was
keen
keep
her
off
the
subject
homework
she
sighed
just
some
guff
about
the
bass
player
the
Weird
Sisters
getting
married
Hermione
opened
the
paper
and
disappeared
behind
Harry
devoted
himself
another
helping
eggs
and
bacon
Ron
was
staring
the
high
windows
looking
slightly
preoccupied
Wait
moment
said
Hermione
suddenly
Sirius
What
happened
said
Harry
snatching
the
paper
violently
ripped
down
the
middle
with
him
and
Hermione
each
holding
one
half
The
Ministry
Magic

received
tip
off

reliable
source
that

Hermione
read
from
her
half
anguished
whisper
Lucius
Malfoy

Harry
low
furious
voice
did
recognise
Sirius
the
platform
What

Ron
looking
alarmed
You

the
other
two
Ministry

Azkaban
the

Hermione
concluded
laying
down
her
half
the
paper
and
looking
fearfully
Harry
and
Ron
Well
just
won
able
leave
the
house
again
that
all
she
whispered
Dumbledore
did
warn
him
not
Harry
looked
down
glumly
the
bit
theProphet
had
torn
off
Most
the
page
was
devoted
advertisement
for
Madam
Malkin
Robes
for
All
Occasions
which
was
apparently
having
sale
Hey
said
flattening
down
Hermione
and
Ron
could
see
Look

Ron
said
Harry
Look

little
piece
here
Ron
and
Hermione
bent
closer
read
the
item
was
barely
inch
long
and
placed
right
the
bottom
column
was
headlined

Hermione
casting
terrified
look
around
them
Six

Azkaban
whispered
Harry
shocked
Just

Don

just
for
trying
get

What
earth
was
doing
the
Ministry
Magic
one
clock
the
morning
breathed
Hermione
you
reckon

doing
something
for
the
Order
Ron
muttered
Wait
moment
said
Harry
slowly
Sturgis
was
supposed
come
and
see
off
remember
The
other
two
looked
him
Yeah

supposed
part
our
guard
going

And
Moody
was
all
annoyed
because

turn

could
Well
maybe
they
didn
expect
him
get
caught
said
Hermione
could
frame
Ron
exclaimed
excitedly
listen
went
dropping
his
voice
dramatically
the
threatening
look
Hermione
face
The
Ministry
suspects
one
Dumbledore
lot
dunno
theylured
him
the
Ministry
and
wasn
trying
get
through
door
all
Maybe
they
just
made
something
get
him
There
was
pause
while
Harry
and
Hermione
considered
this
Harry
thought
seemed
far
fetched
Hermione
the
other
hand
looked
rather
impressed
you
know
wouldn
all
surprised
that
were
true
She
folded
her
half
the
newspaper
thoughtfully
Harry
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
she
seemed
come
out
reverie
Right
well
think
should
tackle
that
essay
for
Sprout
self
fertilising
shrubs
first
and
lucky
able
start
McGonagall
Inanimatus
Conjurus
Spell
before
lunch
Harry
felt
small
twinge
guilt
the
thought
the
pile
homework
awaiting
him
upstairs
but
the
sky
was
clear
exhilarating
blue
and
had
not
been
his
Firebolt
for
week
mean
can
tonight
said
Ron
and
Harry
walked
down
the
sloping
lawns
towards
the
Quidditch
pitch
their
broomsticks
over
their
shoulders
and
with
Hermione
dire
warnings
that
they
would
fail
all
their
still
ringing
their
ears
And
got
tomorrow
She
gets
too
worked
about
work
that
her
trouble
There
was
pause
and
added
slightly
more
anxious
tone
you
think
she
meant
when
she
said
weren
copying
from
her
Yeah
said
Harry
Still
this
important
too
got
practise
want
stay
the
Quidditch
team
Yeah
that
right
said
Ron
heartened
tone
And
have
got
plenty
time
all
they
approached
the
Quidditch
pitch
Harry
glanced
over
his
right
where
the
trees
the
Forbidden
Forest
were
swaying
darkly
Nothing
flew
out
them
the
sky
was
empty
but
for
few
distant
owls
fluttering
around
the
Owlery
tower
had
enough
worry
about
the
flying
horse
wasn
doing
him
any
harm
pushed
out
his
mind
They
collected
balls
from
the
cupboard
the
changing
room
and
set
work
Ron
guarding
the
three
tall
goalposts
Harry
playing
Chaser
and
trying
get
the
Quaffle
past
Ron
Harry
thought
Ron
was
pretty
good
blocked
three
quarters
the
goals
Harry
attempted
put
past
him
and
played
better
the
longer
they
practised
After
couple
hours
they
returned
the
castle
for
lunch
during
which
Hermione
made
quite
clear
she
thought
they
were
irresponsible
then
returned
the
Quidditch
pitch
for
the
real
training
session
All
their
teammates
but
Angelina
were
already
the
changing
room
when
they
entered
All
right
Ron
said
George
winking
him
Yeah
said
Ron
who
had
become
quieter
and
quieter
all
the
way
down
the
pitch
Ready
show
all
Ickle
Prefect
said
Fred
emerging
tousle
haired
from
the
neck
his
Quidditch
robes
slightly
malicious
grin
his
face
Shut
said
Ron
stony
faced
pulling
his
own
team
robes
for
the
first
time
They
fitted
him
well
considering
they
had
been
Oliver
Wood
who
was
rather
broader
the
shoulder
everyone
said
Angelina
entering
from
the
Captain
office
already
changed
Let
get
Alicia
and
Fred
you
can
just
bring
out
the
ball
crate
for
and
there
are
couple
people
out
there
watching
but
want
you
just
ignore
them
all
right
Something
her
would
casual
voice
made
Harry
think
might
know
who
the
uninvited
spectators
were
and
sure
enough
when
they
left
the
changing
room
for
the
bright
sunlight
the
pitch
was
storm
catcalls
and
jeers
from
the
Slytherin
Quidditch
team
and
assorted
hangers
who
were
grouped
halfway
the
empty
stands
and
whose
voices
echoed
loudly
around
the
stadium
What
that
Weasley
riding
Malfoy
called
his
sneering
drawl
Why
would
anyone
put
flying
charm
mouldy
old
log
like
that
Crabbe
Goyle
and
Pansy
Parkinson
guffawed
and
shrieked
with
laughter
Ron
mounted
his
broom
and
kicked
off
from
the
ground
and
Harry
followed
him
watching
his
ears
turn
red
from
behind
Ignore
them
said
accelerating
catch
with
Ron
see
who
laughing
after
play
them
Exactly
the
attitude
want
Harry
said
Angelina
approvingly
soaring
around
them
with
the
Quaffle
under
her
arm
and
slowing
hover
the
spot
front
her
airborne
team
everyone
going
start
with
some
passes
just
warm
the
whole
team
please
Hey
Johnson
what
with
that
hairstyle
anyway
shrieked
Pansy
Parkinson
from
below
Why
would
anyone
want
look
like
they
got
worms
coming
out
their
head
Angelina
swept
her
long
braided
hair
out
her
face
and
continued
calmly
Spread
out
then
and
let
see
what
can
Harry
reversed
away
from
the
others
the
far
side
the
pitch
Ron
fell
back
towards
the
opposite
goal
Angelina
raised
the
Quaffle
with
one
hand
and
threw
hard
Fred
who
passed
George
who
passed
Harry
who
passed
Ron
who
dropped
The
Slytherins
led
Malfoy
roared
and
screamed
with
laughter
Ron
who
had
pelted
towards
the
ground
catch
the
Quaffle
before
landed
pulled
out
the
dive
untidily
that
slipped
sideways
his
broom
and
returned
playing
height
blushing
Harry
saw
Fred
and
George
exchange
looks
but
uncharacteristically
neither
them
said
anything
for
which
was
grateful
Pass
Ron
called
Angelina
though
nothing
had
happened
Ron
threw
the
Quaffle
Alicia
who
passed
back
Harry
who
passed
George
Hey
Potter
how
your
scar
feeling
called
Malfoy
Sure
you
don
need
lie
down
must
what
whole
week
since
you
were
the
hospital
wing
that
record
for
you
isn
George
passed
Angelina
she
reverse
passed
Harry
who
had
not
been
expecting
but
caught
the
very
tips
his
fingers
and
passed
quickly
Ron
who
lunged
for
and
missed
inches
Come
now
Ron
said
Angelina
crossly
dived
for
the
ground
again
chasing
the
Quaffle
Pay
attention
would
have
been
hard
say
whether
Ron
face
the
Quaffle
was
deeper
scarlet
when
again
returned
playing
height
Malfoy
and
the
rest
the
Slytherin
team
were
howling
with
laughter
his
third
attempt
Ron
caught
the
Quaffle
perhaps
out
relief
passed
enthusiastically
that
soared
straight
through
Katie
outstretched
hands
and
hit
her
hard
the
face
Sorry
Ron
groaned
zooming
forwards
see
whether
had
done
any
damage
Get
back
position
she
fine
barked
Angelina
But
you
passing
teammate
try
not
knock
her
off
her
broom
won
you
got
Bludgers
for
that
Katie
nose
was
bleeding
Down
below
the
Slytherins
were
stamping
their
feet
and
jeering
Fred
and
George
converged
Katie
Here
take
this
Fred
told
her
handing
her
something
small
and
purple
from
out
his
pocket
clear
time
All
right
called
Angelina
Fred
George
and
get
your
bats
and
Bludger
Ron
get
the
goalposts
Harry
release
the
Snitch
when
say
going
aim
for
Ron
goal
obviously
Harry
zoomed
off
after
the
twins
fetch
the
Snitch
Ron
making
right
pig
ear
things
isn
muttered
George
the
three
them
landed
the
crate
containing
the
balls
and
opened
extract
one
the
Bludgers
and
the
Snitch
just
nervous
said
Harry
was
fine
when
was
practising
with
him
this
morning
Yeah
well
hope
hasn
peaked
too
soon
said
Fred
gloomily
They
returned
the
air
When
Angelina
blew
her
whistle
Harry
released
the
Snitch
and
Fred
and
George
let
fly
the
Bludger
From
that
moment
Harry
was
barely
aware
what
the
others
were
doing
was
his
job
recapture
the
tiny
fluttering
golden
ball
that
was
worth
hundred
and
fifty
points
the
Seeker
team
and
doing
required
enormous
speed
and
skill
accelerated
rolling
and
swerving
and
out
the
Chasers
the
warm
autumn
air
whipping
his
face
and
the
distant
yells
the
Slytherins
much
meaningless
roaring
his
ears
but
too
soon
the
whistle
brought
him
halt
again
Stop
stop
STOP
screamed
Angelina
Ron
you
not
covering
your
middle
post
Harry
looked
round
Ron
who
was
hovering
front
the
left
hand
hoop
leaving
the
other
two
completely
unprotected
sorry
You
keep
shifting
around
while
you
watching
the
Chasers
said
Angelina
Either
stay
centre
position
until
you
have
move
defend
hoop
else
circle
the
hoops
but
don
drift
vaguely
off
one
side
that
how
you
let
the
last
three
goals
Sorry
Ron
repeated
his
red
face
shining
like
beacon
against
the
bright
blue
sky
And
Katie
can
you
something
about
that
nosebleed
just
getting
worse
said
Katie
thickly
attempting
stem
the
flow
with
her
sleeve
Harry
glanced
round
Fred
who
was
looking
anxious
and
checking
his
pockets
saw
Fred
pull
out
something
purple
examine
for
second
and
then
look
round
Katie
evidently
horror
struck
Well
let
try
again
said
Angelina
She
was
ignoring
the
Slytherins
who
had
now
set
chant
Gryffindor
are
losers
Gryffindor
are
losers
but
there
was
certain
rigidity
about
her
seat
the
broom
nevertheless
This
time
they
had
been
flying
for
barely
three
minutes
when
Angelina
whistle
sounded
Harry
who
had
just
sighted
the
Snitch
circling
the
opposite
goalpost
pulled
feeling
distinctly
aggrieved
What
now
said
impatiently
Alicia
who
was
nearest
Katie
she
said
shortly
Harry
turned
and
saw
Angelina
Fred
and
George
all
flying
fast
they
could
towards
Katie
Harry
and
Alicia
sped
towards
her
too
was
plain
that
Angelina
had
stopped
training
just
time
Katie
was
now
chalk
white
and
covered
blood
She
needs
the
hospital
wing
said
Angelina
take
her
said
Fred
She
might
have
swallowed
Blood
Blisterpod
mistake
Well
there
point
continuing
with
Beaters
and
Chaser
gone
said
Angelina
glumly
Fred
and
George
zoomed
off
towards
the
castle
supporting
Katie
between
them
Come
let
and
get
changed
The
Slytherins
continued
chant
they
trailed
back
into
the
changing
rooms
How
was
practice
asked
Hermione
rather
coolly
half
hour
later
Harry
and
Ron
climbed
through
the
portrait
hole
into
the
Gryffindor
common
room
was
Harry
began
Completely
lousy
said
Ron
hollow
voice
sinking
into
chair
beside
Hermione
She
looked
Ron
and
her
frostiness
seemed
melt
Well
was
only
your
first
one
she
said
consolingly
bound
take
time
Who
said
was
who
made
lousy
snapped
Ron
one
said
Hermione
looking
taken
aback
thought
You
thought
was
bound
rubbish
course
didn
Look
you
said
was
lousy
just
going
get
started
some
homework
said
Ron
angrily
and
stomped
off
the
staircase
the
boys
dormitories
and
vanished
from
sight
Hermione
turned
Harry
Was
lousy
said
Harry
loyally
Hermione
raised
her
eyebrows
Well
suppose
could
played
better
Harry
muttered
but
was
only
the
first
training
session
like
you
said
Neither
Harry
nor
Ron
seemed
make
much
headway
with
their
homework
that
night
Harry
knew
Ron
was
too
preoccupied
with
how
badly
had
performed
Quidditch
practice
and
himself
was
having
difficulty
getting
the
Gryffindor
are
losers
chant
out
his
head
They
spent
the
whole
Sunday
the
common
room
buried
their
books
while
the
room
around
them
filled
then
emptied
was
another
clear
fine
day
and
most
their
fellow
Gryffindors
spent
the
day
out
the
grounds
enjoying
what
might
well
some
the
last
sunshine
that
year
the
evening
Harry
felt
though
somebody
had
been
beating
his
brain
against
the
inside
his
skull
You
know
probably
should
try
and
get
more
homework
done
during
the
week
Harry
muttered
Ron
they
finally
laid
aside
Professor
McGonagall
long
essay
the
Inanimatus
Conjurus
Spell
and
turned
miserably
Professor
Sinistra
equally
long
and
difficult
essay
about
Jupiter
smany
moons
Yeah
said
Ron
rubbing
slightly
bloodshot
eyes
and
throwing
his
fifth
spoiled
bit
parchment
into
the
fire
beside
them
Listen
shall
just
ask
Hermione
can
have
look
what
she
done
Harry
glanced
over
her
she
was
sitting
with
Crookshanks
her
lap
and
chatting
merrily
Ginny
pair
knitting
needles
flashed
midair
front
her
now
knitting
pair
shapeless
elf
socks
said
heavily
you
know
she
won
let
And
they
worked
while
the
sky
outside
the
windows
became
steadily
darker
Slowly
the
crowd
the
common
room
began
thin
again
half
past
eleven
Hermione
wandered
over
them
yawning
Nearly
done
said
Ron
shortly
Jupiter
biggest
moon
Ganymede
not
Callisto
she
said
pointing
over
Ron
shoulder
line
his
Astronomy
essay
and
that
got
the
volcanoes
Thanks
snarled
Ron
scratching
out
the
offending
sentences
Sorry
only
Yeah
well
you
just
come
over
here
criticize
Ron
haven
got
time
listen
sermon
all
right
Hermione
neck
here
look
Hermione
was
pointing
the
nearest
window
Harry
and
Ron
both
looked
over
handsome
screech
owl
was
standing
the
windowsill
gazing
into
the
room
Ron
Isn
that
Hermes
said
Hermione
sounding
amazed
Blimey
said
Ron
quietly
throwing
down
his
quill
and
getting
his
feet
What
Percy
writing
for
crossed
the
window
and
opened
Hermes
flew
inside
landed
Ron
essay
and
held
out
leg
which
letter
was
attached
Ron
took
the
letter
off
and
the
owl
departed
once
leaving
inky
footprints
across
Ron
drawing
the
moon
That
definitely
Percy
handwriting
said
Ron
sinking
back
into
his
chair
and
staring
the
words
the
outside
the
scroll
Ronald
Weasley
Gryffindor
House
Hogwarts
looked
the
other
two
What
you
reckon
Open
said
Hermione
eagerly
and
Harry
nodded
Ron
unrolled
the
scroll
and
began
read
The
further
down
the
parchment
his
eyes
travelled
the
more
pronounced
became
his
scowl
When
had
finished
reading
looked
disgusted
thrust
the
letter
Harry
and
Hermione
who
leaned
towards
each
other
read
together
Dear
Ron
have
only
just
heard
from
less
person
than
the
Minister
for
Magic
himself
who
has
from
your
new
teacher
Professor
Umbridge
that
you
have
become
Hogwarts
prefect
was
most
pleasantly
surprised
when
heard
this
news
and
must
firstly
offer
congratulations
must
admit
that
have
always
been
afraid
that
you
would
take
what
might
call
the
Fred
and
George
route
rather
than
following
footsteps
you
can
imagine
feelings
hearing
you
have
stopped
flouting
authority
and
have
decided
shoulder
some
real
responsibility
But
want
give
you
more
than
congratulations
Ron
want
give
you
some
advice
which
why
sending
this
night
rather
than
the
usual
morning
post
Hopefully
you
will
able
read
this
away
from
prying
eyes
and
avoid
awkward
questions
From
something
the
Minister
let
slip
when
telling
you
are
now
prefect
gather
that
you
are
still
seeing
lot
Harry
Potter
must
tell
you
Ron
that
nothing
could
put
you
danger
losing
your
badge
more
than
continued
fraternisation
with
that
boy
Yes
sure
you
are
surprised
hear
this
doubt
you
will
say
that
Potter
has
always
been
Dumbledore
favourite
but
feel
bound
tell
you
that
Dumbledore
may
not
charge
Hogwarts
much
longer
and
the
people
who
count
have
very
different
and
probably
more
accurate
view
Potter
behaviour
shall
say
more
here
but
you
look
the
Daily
Prophet
tomorrow
you
will
get
good
idea
the
way
the
wind
blowing
and
see
you
can
spot
yours
truly
Seriously
Ron
you
not
want
tarred
with
the
same
brush
Potter
could
very
damaging
your
future
prospects
and
talking
here
about
life
after
school
too
you
must
aware
given
that
our
father
escorted
him
court
Potter
had
disciplinary
hearing
this
summer
front
the
whole
Wizengamot
and
did
not
come
out
looking
too
good
got
off
mere
technicality
you
ask
and
many
the
people
spoken
remain
convinced
his
guilt
may
that
you
are
afraid
sever
ties
with
Potter
know
that
can
unbalanced
and
for
all
know
violent
but
you
have
any
worries
about
this
have
spotted
anything
else
Potter
behaviour
that
troubling
you
urge
you
speak
Dolores
Umbridge
truly
delightful
woman
who
know
will
only
too
happy
advise
you
This
leads
other
bit
advice
have
hinted
above
Dumbledore
regime
Hogwarts
may
soon
over
Your
loyalty
Ron
should
not
him
but
the
school
and
the
Ministry
very
sorry
hear
that
far
Professor
Umbridge
encountering
very
little
operation
from
staff
she
strives
make
those
necessary
changes
within
Hogwarts
that
theMinistry
ardently
desires
although
she
should
find
this
easier
from
next
week
again
see
the
Daily
Prophet
tomorrow
shall
say
only
this
student
who
shows
himself
willing
help
Professor
Umbridge
now
may
very
well
placed
for
Head
Boyship
couple
years
sorry
that
was
unable
see
more
you
over
the
summer
pains
criticize
our
parents
but
afraid
can
longer
live
under
their
roof
while
they
remain
mixed
with
the
dangerous
crowd
around
Dumbledore
you
are
writing
Mother
any
point
you
might
tell
her
that
certain
Sturgis
Podmore
who
great
friend
Dumbledore
has
recently
been
sent
Azkaban
for
trespass
the
Ministry
Perhaps
that
will
open
their
eyes
the
kind
petty
criminals
with
whom
they
are
currently
rubbing
shoulders
count
myself
very
lucky
have
escaped
the
stigma
association
with
such
people
the
Minister
really
could
not
more
gracious
and
hope
Ron
that
you
will
not
allow
family
ties
blind
you
the
misguided
nature
our
parents
beliefs
and
actions
either
sincerely
hope
that
time
they
will
realise
how
mistaken
they
were
and
shall
course
ready
accept
full
apology
when
that
day
comes
Please
think
over
what
have
said
most
carefully
particularly
the
bit
about
Harry
Potter
and
congratulations
again
becoming
prefect
Your
brother
Percy
Harry
looked
Ron
Well
said
trying
sound
though
found
the
whole
thing
joke
you
want
what
checked
Percy
letter
yeah
sever
ties
with
swear
won
get
violent
Give
back
said
Ron
holding
out
his
hand
Ron
said
jerkily
tearing
Percy
letter
half
the
world
tore
into
quarters
biggest
tore
into
eighths
git
threw
the
pieces
into
the
fire
Come
got
get
this
finished
sometime
before
dawn
said
briskly
Harry
pulling
Professor
Sinistra
essay
back
towards
him
Hermione
was
looking
Ron
with
odd
expression
her
face
give
them
here
she
said
abruptly
What
said
Ron
Give
them
look
through
them
and
correct
them
she
said
Are
you
serious
Hermione
you
life
saver
said
Ron
what
can
What
you
can
say
promise
never
leave
our
homework
this
late
again
she
said
holding
out
both
hands
for
their
essays
but
she
looked
slightly
amused
all
the
same
Thanks
million
Hermione
said
Harry
weakly
passing
over
his
essay
and
sinking
back
into
his
armchair
rubbing
his
eyes
was
now
past
midnight
and
the
common
room
was
deserted
but
for
the
three
them
and
Crookshanks
The
only
sound
was
that
Hermione
quill
scratching
out
sentences
here
and
there
their
essays
and
the
ruffle
pages
she
checked
various
facts
the
reference
books
strewn
across
the
table
Harry
was
exhausted
also
felt
odd
sick
empty
feeling
his
stomach
that
had
nothing
with
tiredness
and
everything
with
the
letter
now
curling
blackly
the
heart
the
fire
knew
that
half
the
people
inside
Hogwarts
thought
him
strange
even
mad
knew
that
theDaily
Prophet
had
been
making
snide
allusions
him
for
months
but
there
was
something
about
seeing
written
down
like
that
Percy
writing
about
knowing
that
Percy
was
advising
Ron
drop
him
and
even
tell
tales
about
him
Umbridge
that
made
his
situation
real
him
nothing
else
had
had
known
Percy
for
four
years
had
stayed
his
house
during
the
summer
holidays
shared
tent
with
him
during
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
had
even
been
awarded
full
marks
him
the
second
task
the
Triwizard
Tournament
last
year
yet
now
Percy
thought
him
unbalanced
and
possibly
violent
And
with
surge
sympathy
for
his
godfather
Harry
thought
Sirius
was
probably
the
only
person
knew
who
could
really
understand
how
felt
the
moment
because
Sirius
was
the
same
situation
Nearly
everyone
the
wizarding
world
thought
Sirius
dangerous
murderer
and
great
Voldemort
supporter
and
had
had
live
with
that
knowledge
for
fourteen
years
Harry
blinked
had
just
seen
something
the
fire
that
could
not
have
been
there
had
flashed
into
sight
and
vanished
immediately
could
not
have
been
had
imagined
because
had
been
thinking
about
Sirius
write
that
down
Hermione
said
Ron
pushing
his
essay
and
sheet
covered
her
own
writing
back
Ron
then
add
this
conclusion
written
for
you
Hermione
you
are
honestly
the
most
wonderful
person
ever
met
said
Ron
weakly
and
ever
rude
you
again
know
you
back
normal
said
Hermione
Harry
yours
except
for
this
bit
the
end
think
you
must
have
misheard
Professor
Sinistra
Europa
covered
ice
not
mice
Harry
Harry
had
slid
off
his
chair
his
knees
and
was
now
crouching
the
singed
and
threadbare
hearthrug
gazing
into
the
flames
Harry
said
Ron
uncertainly
Why
are
you
down
there
Because
just
seen
Sirius
head
the
fire
said
Harry
spoke
quite
calmly
after
all
had
seen
Sirius
head
this
very
fire
the
previous
year
and
talked
too
nevertheless
could
not
sure
that
had
really
seen
this
time
had
vanished
quickly
Sirius
head
Hermione
repeated
You
mean
like
when
wanted
talk
you
during
the
Triwizard
Tournament
But
wouldn
that
now
would
too
Sirius
She
gasped
gazing
the
fire
Ron
dropped
his
quill
There
the
middle
the
dancing
flames
sat
Sirius
head
long
dark
hair
falling
around
his
grinning
face
was
starting
think
you
bed
before
everyone
else
had
disappeared
said
been
checking
every
hour
You
been
popping
into
the
fire
every
hour
Harry
said
half
laughing
Just
for
few
seconds
check
the
coast
was
clear
But
what
you
been
seen
said
Hermione
anxiously
Well
think
girl
first
year
the
look
her
might
got
glimpse
earlier
but
don
worry
Sirius
said
hastily
Hermione
clapped
hand
her
mouth
was
gone
the
moment
she
looked
back
and
bet
she
just
thought
was
oddly
shaped
log
something
But
Sirius
this
taking
awful
risk
Hermione
began
You
sound
like
Molly
said
Sirius
This
was
the
only
way
could
come
with
answering
Harry
letter
without
resorting
code
and
codes
are
breakable
the
mention
Harry
letter
Hermione
and
Ron
both
turned
stare
him
You
didn
say
you
written
Sirius
said
Hermione
accusingly
forgot
said
Harry
which
was
perfectly
true
his
meeting
with
Cho
the
Owlery
had
driven
everything
before
out
his
mind
Don
look
like
that
Hermione
there
was
way
anyone
would
have
got
secret
information
out
was
there
Sirius
was
very
good
said
Sirius
smiling
Anyway
better
quick
just
case
disturbed
your
scar
What
about
Ron
began
but
Hermione
interrupted
him
tell
you
afterwards
Sirius
Well
know
can
fun
when
hurts
but
don
think
anything
really
worry
about
kept
aching
all
last
year
didn
Yeah
and
Dumbledore
said
happened
whenever
Voldemort
was
feeling
powerful
emotion
said
Harry
ignoring
usual
Ron
and
Hermione
winces
maybe
was
just
dunno
really
angry
something
the
night
had
that
detention
Well
now
back
bound
hurt
more
often
said
Sirius
you
don
think
had
anything
with
Umbridge
touching
when
was
detention
with
her
Harry
asked
doubt
said
Sirius
know
her
reputation
and
sure
she
Death
Eater
She
foul
enough
one
said
Harry
darkly
and
Ron
and
Hermione
nodded
vigorously
agreement
Yes
but
the
world
isn
split
into
good
people
and
Death
Eaters
said
Sirius
with
wry
smile
know
she
nasty
piece
work
though
you
should
hear
Remus
talk
about
her
Does
Lupin
know
her
asked
Harry
quickly
remembering
Umbridge
comments
about
dangerous
half
breeds
during
her
first
lesson
said
Sirius
but
she
drafted
bit
anti
werewolf
legislation
two
years
ago
that
makes
almost
impossible
for
him
get
job
Harry
remembered
how
much
shabbier
Lupin
looked
these
days
and
his
dislike
Umbridge
deepened
even
further
What
she
got
against
werewolves
said
Hermione
angrily
Scared
them
expect
said
Sirius
smiling
her
indignation
Apparently
she
loathes
part
humans
she
campaigned
have
merpeople
rounded
and
tagged
last
year
too
Imagine
wasting
your
time
and
energy
persecuting
merpeople
when
there
are
little
toerags
like
Kreacher
the
loose
Ron
laughed
but
Hermione
looked
upset
Sirius
she
said
reproachfully
Honestly
you
made
bit
effort
with
Kreacher
sure
respond
After
all
you
are
the
only
member
his
family
got
left
and
Professor
Dumbledore
said
what
are
Umbridge
lessons
like
Sirius
interrupted
she
training
you
all
kill
half
breeds
said
Harry
ignoring
Hermione
affronted
look
being
cut
off
her
defence
Kreacher
She
not
letting
use
magic
all
All
read
the
stupid
textbook
said
Ron
well
that
figures
said
Sirius
Our
information
from
inside
the
Ministry
that
Fudge
doesn
want
you
trained
combat
Trained
combat
repeated
Harry
incredulously
What
does
think
doing
here
forming
some
sort
wizard
army
That
exactly
what
thinks
you
doing
said
Sirius
rather
that
exactly
what
afraid
Dumbledore
doing
forming
his
own
private
army
with
which
will
able
take
the
Ministry
Magic
There
was
pause
this
then
Ron
said
That
the
most
stupid
thing
ever
heard
including
all
the
stuff
that
Luna
Lovegood
comes
out
with
being
prevented
from
learning
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
because
Fudge
scared
use
spells
against
the
Ministry
said
Hermione
looking
furious
Yep
said
Sirius
Fudge
thinks
Dumbledore
will
stop
nothing
seize
power
getting
more
paranoid
about
Dumbledore
the
day
matter
time
before
has
Dumbledore
arrested
some
trumped
charge
This
reminded
Harry
Percy

Sirius

There
was
definite
note
bitterness
Sirius
voice

said
Sirius
well
was
supposed
back
now

sure
what

Then
seeing
their
stricken
faces
added
quickly
But
Dumbledore
not
worried

state
sure
Hagrid

But

said
Hermione
small
anxious
voice
Madame

with
her
and
she
says
they
got
separated
the
journey
home
but
there
nothing

perfectly
Unconvinced
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
exchanged
worried
looks
Listen
don
asking
too
many
questions
about
Hagrid
said
Sirius
hastily
just
draw
even
more
attention
the
fact
that
not
back
and
know
Dumbledore
doesn
want
that
Hagrid
tough
And
when
they
did
not
appear
cheered
this
Sirius
added
When

next
Hogsmeade
weekend

thinking

Harry
and
Hermione
together
very
loudly
Sirius
didn

theDaily
Prophet
said
Hermione
anxiously
that
said
Sirius
grinning
they
always
guessing
where
they
haven
really
got
clue
Yeah
but
think
this
time
they
have
said
Harry
Something
Malfoy
said
the
train
made
think
knew
was
you
and
his
father
was
the
platform
Sirius

Lucius
Malfoy
don
come
here
whatever
you
Malfoy
recognizes
you
again
All
right
all

got
the
point
said
Sirius
looked
most
displeased
Just
idea
thought
you
might
like
get
together
would
just
don
want
you
chucked
back
Azkaban
said
Harry
There
was
pause
which
Sirius
looked
out
the
fire
Harry
crease
between
his
sunken
eyes
You
less
like
your
father
than
thought
said
finally
definite
coolness
his
voice
The
risk
would
been
what
made
fun
for
James
Look
Well
better
get
going

hear
Kreacher
coming
down
the
stairs
said
Sirius
but
Harry
was
sure

lying

you
time

make
back
into
the
fire
then
shall
you

There
was
tinypop

Hermione
finished

and
looked
across
the
table
the
other
two
now
know
how
ended
with
Umbridge
Fudge
passed
this
Educational
Decree
and
forced
her
And
now
given
her
the
power

the
other

Hermione
was
breathing
fast
and
her
eyes
were
very
bright
can
believe
this
outrageous
know
said
Harry
looked
down
his
right
hand
clenched
the
table
top
and
saw
the
faint
white
outline
the
words
Umbridge
had
forced
him
cut
into
his
skin
But
grin
was
unfurling
Ron
face
What

Harry
and
Hermione
together
staring
him
can

But
Professor
Umbridge
was
not

their

the

nor

when
they

Snape
with
smirk
swept
among
them
passing
back
their
homework
This
should
give
you
realistic
idea
what
expect
the
examination
Snape
reached
the
front
the
class
and
turned
his
heel
face
them
The
general
standard
this
homework
was
abysmal
Most
you
would
have
failed
had
this
been
your
examination
expect
see
great
deal
more

Malfoy
sniggered
and
said
carrying
whisper
Some
people
got
Harry
realised
that
Hermione
was
looking
sideways
see
what
grade
had
received
slid
his
moonstone
essay
back
into
his
bag
quickly
possible
feeling
that
would
rather
keep
that
information
private
Determined
not
give
Snape
excuse
fail
him
this
lesson
Harry
read
and
reread
every
line
instructions
the
blackboard
least
three
times
before
acting
them
His
Strengthening
Solution
was
not
precisely
the
clear
turquoise
shade
Hermione
but
was
least
blue
rather
than
pink
like
Neville
and
delivered
flask
Snape
desk
the
end
the
lesson
with
feeling
mingled
defiance
and
relief
Well
that
wasn
bad
last
week
was
said
Hermione
they
climbed
the
steps
out
the
dungeon
and
made
their
way
across
the
Entrance
Hall
towards
lunch
And
the
homework
didn
too
badly
either
did
When
neither
Ron
nor
Harry
answered
she
pressed
mean
all
right
didn
expect
the
top
grade
not
marking
standard
but
pass
quite
encouraging
this
stage
wouldn
you
say
Harry
made
non
committal
noise
his
throat
course
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
the
exam
got
plenty
time
improve
but
the
grades
getting
now
are
sort
baseline
aren
they
Something

build
They
sat
down
together
the
Gryffindor
table
Obviously

Hermione
said
Ron
sharply
you
want
know
what
grades

didn
mean
well

said
Ron
ladling
soup
into
his
bowl
Happy
Well
that
nothing
ashamed
said
Fred
who
had
just
arrived
the
table
with
George
and
Lee
Jordan
and
was
sitting
down
Harry
right
Nothing
wrong
with
good
healthy
But
said
Hermione
doesn
stand
for
Poor
yeah
said
Lee
Jordan
Still
better
than
isn
Dreadful
Harry
felt
his
face
grow
warm
and
faked
small
coughing
fit
over
his
roll
When
emerged
from
this
was
sorry
find
that
Hermione
was
still
full
flow
about
grades
top
grade
for
Outstanding
she
was
saying
and
then
there
George
corrected
her
for
Exceeds
Expectations
And
always
thought
Fred
and
should
got
everything
because
exceeded
expectations
just
turning
for
the
exams
They
all
laughed
except
Hermione
who
ploughed
after
for
Acceptable
and
that
the
last
pass
grade

Yep
said
Fred
dunking
entire
roll
his
soup
transferring
his
mouth
and
swallowing
whole
Then
you
get
for
Poor
Ron
raised
both
his
arms
mock
celebration
and
for
Dreadful
And
then
George
reminded
him
asked
Hermione
looking
appalled
Even
lower
than
What
earth
does
stand
for
Troll
said
George
promptly
Harry
laughed
again
though
was
not
sure
whether
not
George
was
joking
imagined
trying
conceal
from
Hermione
that
had
received
all
his
and
immediately
resolved
work
harder
from
now
You
lot
had
inspected
lesson

Fred
asked
them
said
Hermione
once
Have

Just
now
before

said
George
Charms
What

like
Harry
and
Hermione
asked
together
Fred
shrugged
Not

Umbridge
just
lurked
the
corner
making
notes
clipboard
You
know
what
Flitwick
like
treated
her
like
guest
didn
seem
bother
him
all
She
didn
say
much
Asked
Alicia
couple
questions
about
what
the
classes
are
normally
like
Alicia
told
her
theywere
really
good
that
was

see
old
Flitwick
getting
marked

said
George
usually
gets
everyone
through
their
exams

Who

this
afternoon
Fred
asked
Harry
Trelawney
ever
saw
one
and
Umbridge
herself
Well

boy
and
keep
your
temper
with
Umbridge
today
said
George
Angelina
her
nut
you
miss
any
more
Quidditch
practices
But
Harry
did
not
have
wait
for
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
meet
Professor
Umbridge
was
pulling
out
his
dream
diary
seat
the
very
back
the
shadowy
Divination
room
when
Ron
elbowed
him
the
ribs
and
looking
round
saw
Professor
Umbridge
emerging
through
the
trapdoor
the
floor
The
class
which
had
been
talking
cheerily
fell
silent
once
The
abrupt
fall
the
noise
level
made
Professor
Trelawney
who
had
been
wafting
about
handing
out
copies
ofThe
Dream
Oracle
look
round
Good
afternoon
Professor
Trelawney
said
Professor
Umbridge
with
her
wide
smile
You
received
note
trust
Giving
the
time
and
date
your
inspection
Professor
Trelawney
nodded
curtly
and
looking
very
disgruntled
turned
her
back
Professor
Umbridge
and
continued
give
out
books
Still
smiling
Professor
Umbridge
grasped
the
back
the
nearest
armchair
and
pulled
the
front
the
class
that
was
few
inches
behind
Professor
Trelawney
seat
She
then
sat
down
took
her
clipboard
from
her
flowery
bag
and
looked
expectantly
waiting
for
the
class
begin
Professor
Trelawney
pulled
her
shawls
tight
about
her
with
slightly
trembling
hands
and
surveyed
the
class
through
her
hugely
magnifying
lenses
shall
continuing
our
study
prophetic
dreams
today
she
said
brave
attempt
her
usual
mystic
tones
though
her
voice
shook
slightly
Divide
into
pairs
please
and
interpret
each
other
latest
night
time
visions
with
the
aid
theOracle
She
made
though
sweep
back
her
seat
saw
Professor
Umbridge
sitting
right
beside
and
immediately
veered
left
towards
Parvati
and
Lavender
who
were
already
deep
discussion
about
Parvati
most
recent
dream
Harry
opened
his
copy
ofThe
Dream
Oracle
watching
Umbridge
covertly
She
was
already
making
notes
her
clipboard
After
few
minutes
she
got
her
feet
and
began
pace
the
room
Trelawney
wake
listening
her
conversations
with
students
and
posing
questions
here
and
there
Harry
bent
his
head
hurriedly
over
his
book
Think
dream
quick
told
Ron
case
the
old
toad
comes
our
way
did
last
time
Ron
protested
your
turn

said
Harry
desperately
who
could
not
remember
dreaming
anything
all
over
the
last
few
days
Let
say
dreamed
was
drowning
Snape
cauldron
Yeah

matter
pick
any
them
said
Harry
chancing
glance
behind
him
Professor
Umbridge
was
now
standing
Professor
Trelawney
shoulder
making
notes
while
the
Divination
teacher
questioned
Neville
about
his
dream
diary
What
night
did
you
dream
this
again
Ron
said
immersed
calculations
dunno
last
night
whenever
you
like
Harry
told
him
trying
listen
what
Umbridge
was
saying
Professor
Trelawney
They
were
only
table
away
from
him
and
Ron
now
Professor
Umbridge
was
making
another
note
her
clipboard
and
Professor
Trelawney
was
looking
extremely
put
out
Now
said
Umbridge
looking
Trelawney
you
been
this
post
how
long
exactly
Professor
Trelawney
scowled
her
arms
crossed
and
shoulders
hunched
though
wishing
protect
herself
much
possible
from
the
indignity
the
inspection
After
slight
pause
which
she
seemed
decide
that
the
question
was
not
offensive
that
she
could
reasonably
ignore
she
said
deeply
resentful
tone
Nearly
sixteen
years
Quite
period
said
Professor
Umbridge
making
note
her
clipboard
was
Professor
Dumbledore
who
appointed
you
That
right
said
Professor
Trelawney
shortly
Professor
Umbridge
made
another
note
And
you
are
great
great
granddaughter
the
celebrated
Seer
Cassandra
Trelawney
Yes
said
Professor
Trelawney
holding
her
head
little
higher
Another
note
the
clipboard
But
think
correct
mistaken
that
you
are
the
first
your
family
since
Cassandra
possessed
Second
Sight
These
things
often
skip
three
generations
said
Professor
Trelawney
Professor
Umbridge
toadlike
smile
widened
course
she
said
sweetly
making
yet
another
note
Well
you
could
just
predict
something
for
then
And
she
looked
enquiringly
still
smiling
Professor
Trelawney
stiffened
though
unable
believe
her
ears
don
understand
you
she
said
clutching
convulsively
the
shawl
around
her
scrawny
neck
like
you
make
prediction
for
said
Professor
Umbridge
very
clearly
Harry
and
Ron
were
not
the
only
people
now
watching
and
listening
sneakily
from
behind
their
books
Most
the
class
were
staring
transfixed
Professor
Trelawney
she
drew
herself
her
full
height
her
beads
and
bangles
clinking
The
Inner
Eye
does
not
See
upon
command
she
said
scandalised
tones
see
said
Professor
Umbridge
softly
making
yet
another
note
her
clipboard
but
but
wait
said
Professor
Trelawney
suddenly
attempt
her
usual
ethereal
voice
though
the
mystical
effect
was
ruined
somewhat
the
way
was
shaking
with
anger
think
Ido
see
something
something
that
concerns
you
why
sense
something
somethingdark
some
grave
peril
Professor
Trelawney
pointed
shaking
finger
Professor
Umbridge
who
continued
smile
blandly
her
eyebrows
raised
afraid
afraid
that
you
are
grave
danger
Professor
Trelawney
finished
dramatically
There
was
pause
Professor
Umbridge
surveyed
Professor
Trelawney
Right
she
said
softly
scribbling
her
clipboard
once
more
Well
that
really
the
best
you
can
She
turned
away
leaving
Professor
Trelawney
standing
rooted
the
spot
her
chest
heaving
Harry
caught
Ron
eye
and
knew
that
Ron
was
thinking
exactly
the
same
was
they
both
knew
that
Professor
Trelawney
was
old
fraud
but
the
other
hand
they
loathed
Umbridge
much
that
they
felt
very
much
Trelawney
side
until
she
swooped
down
them
few
seconds
later
that
Well
she
said
snapping
her
long
fingers
under
Harry
nose
uncharacteristically
brisk
Let
see
the
start
you
made
your
dream
diary
please
And
the
time
she
had
interpreted
Harry
dreams
the
top
her
voice
all
which
even
the
ones
that
involved
eating
porridge
apparently
foretold
gruesome
and
early
death
was
feeling
much
less
sympathetic
towards
her
All
the
while
Professor
Umbridge
stood
few
feet
away
making
notes
that
clipboard
and
when
the
bell
rang
she
descended
the
silver
ladder
first
and
was
waiting
for
them
all
when
they
reached
their
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
ten
minutes
later
She
was
humming
and
smiling
herself
when
they
entered
the
room
Harry
and
Ron
told
Hermione
who
had
been
Arithmancy
exactly
what
had
happened
Divination
while
they
all
took
out
their
copies
ofDefensive
Magical
Theory
but
before
Hermione
could
ask
any
questions
Professor
Umbridge
had
called
them
all
order
and
silence
fell
Wands
away
she
instructed
them
all
with
smile
and
those
people
who
had
been
hopeful
enough
take
them
out
sadly
returned
them
their
bags
finished
Chapter
One
last
lesson
would
like
you
all
turn
page
nineteen
today
and
commence
Chapter
Two
Common
Defensive
Theories
and
their
Derivation
There
will
need
talk
Still
smiling
her
wide
self
satisfied
smile
she
sat
down
her
desk
The
class
gave
audible
sigh
turned
one
page
nineteen
Harry
wondered
dully
whether
there
were
enough
chapters
the
book
keep
them
reading
through
all
this
year
lessons
and
was
the
point
checking
the
contents
page
when
noticed
that
Hermione
had
her
hand
the
air
again
Professor
Umbridge
had
noticed
too
and
what
was
more
she
seemed
have
worked
out
strategy
for
just
such
eventuality
Instead
trying
pretend
she
had
not
noticed
Hermione
she
got
her
feet
and
walked
around
the
front
row
desks
until
they
were
face
face
then
she
bent
down
and
whispered
that
the
rest
the
class
could
not
hear
What
this
time
Miss
Granger
already
read
Chapter
Two
said
Hermione
Well
then
proceed
Chapter
Three
read
that
too
read
the
whole
book
Professor
Umbridge
blinked
but
recovered
her
poise
almost
instantly
Well
then
you
should
able
tell
what
Slinkhard
says
about
counter
jinxes
Chapter
Fifteen
says
that
counter
jinxes
are
improperly
named
said
Hermione
promptly
says
counter
jinx
just
name
people
give
their
jinxes
when
they
want
make
them
sound
more
acceptable
Professor
Umbridge
raised
her
eyebrows
and
Harry
knew
she
was
impressed
against
her
will
But
disagree
Hermione
continued
Professor
Umbridge
eyebrows
rose
little
higher
and
her
gaze
became
distinctly
colder
You
disagree
she
repeated
Yes
said
Hermione
who
unlike
Umbridge
was
not
whispering
but
speaking
clear
carrying
voice
that
had
now
attracted
the
attention
the
rest
the
class
Slinkhard
doesn
like
jinxes
does
But
think
they
can
very
useful
when
they
used
defensively
you
you
said
Professor
Umbridge
forgetting
whisper
and
straightening
Well
afraid
Slinkhard
opinion
and
not
yours
that
matters
within
this
classroom
Miss
Granger
But
Hermione
began
That
enough
said
Professor
Umbridge
She
walked
back
the
front
the
class
and
stood
before
them
all
the
jauntiness
she
had
shown
the
beginning
the
lesson
gone
Miss
Granger
going
take
five
points
from
Gryffindor
house
There
was
outbreak
muttering
this
What
for
said
Harry
angrily
Don
you
get
involved
Hermione
whispered
urgently
him
For
disrupting
class
with
pointless
interruptions
said
Professor
Umbridge
smoothly
here
teach
you
using
Ministry
approved
method
that
does
not
include
inviting
students
give
their
opinions
matters
about
which
they
understand
very
little
Your
previous
teachers
this
subject
may
have
allowed
you
more
licence
but
none
them
with
the
possible
exception
Professor
Quirrell
who
did
least
appear
have
restricted
himself
age
appropriate
subjects
would
have
passed
Ministry
inspection
Yeah
Quirrell
was
great
teacher
said
Harry
loudly
there
was
just
that
minor
drawback
him
having
Lord
Voldemort
sticking
out
the
back
his
head
This
pronouncement
was
followed
one
the
loudest
silences
Harry
had
ever
heard
Then
think
another
week
detentions
would
you
some
good
Potter
said
Umbridge
sleekly
The
cut
the
back
Harry
hand
had
barely
healed
and
the
following
morning
was
bleeding
again
did
not
complain
during
the
evening
detention
was
determined
not
give
Umbridge
the
satisfaction
over
and
over
again
wroteI
must
not
tell
lies
and
not
sound
escaped
his
lips
though
the
cut
deepened
with
every
letter
The
very
worst
part
this
second
week
worth
detentions
was
just
George
had
predicted
Angelina
reaction
She
cornered
him
just
arrived
the
Gryffindor
table
for
breakfast
Tuesday
and
shouted
loudly
that
Professor
McGonagall
came
sweeping
down
upon
the
pair
them
from
the
staff
table
Miss
Johnson
howdare
you
make
such
racket
the
Great
Hall
Five
points
from
Gryffindor
But
Professor
gone
and
landed
himself
detentionagain
What
this
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
sharply
rounding
Harry
Detention
From
whom
From
Professor
Umbridge
muttered
Harry
not
meeting
Professor
McGonagall
beady
square
framed
eyes
Are
you
telling
she
said
lowering
her
voice
that
the
group
curious
Ravenclaws
behind
them
could
not
hear
that
after
the
warning
gave
you
last
Monday
you
lost
your
temper
Professor
Umbridge
class
again
Yes
Harry
muttered
speaking
the
floor
Potter
you
must
get
grip
yourself
You
are
heading
for
serious
trouble
Another
five
points
from
Gryffindor
But
what
Professor
Harry
said
furious
this
injustice
already
being
punished
her
why
you
have
take
points
well
Because
detentions
not
appear
have
any
effect
you
whatsoever
said
Professor
McGonagall
tartly
not
another
word
complaint
Potter
And
for
you
Miss
Johnson
you
will
confine
your
shouting
matches
the
Quidditch
pitch
future
risk
losing
the
team
captaincy
Professor
McGonagall
strode
back
towards
the
staff
table
Angelina
gave
Harry
look
deepest
disgust
and
stalked
away
upon
which
flung
himself
the
bench
beside
Ron
fuming
She
taken
points
off
Gryffindor
because
having
hand
sliced
open
every
night
How
that
fair
how

said
Ron
sympathetically
tipping
bacon
Harry
plate
she
bang
out
order
Hermione
however
merely
rustled
the
pages
herDaily
Prophet
and
said
nothing
You
think
McGonagall
was
right
you
said
Harry
angrily
the
picture
Cornelius
Fudge
obscuring
Hermione
face
wish
she
hadn
taken
points
from
you
but
think
she
right
warn
you
not
lose
your
temper
with
Umbridge
said
Hermione
voice
while
Fudge
gesticulated
forcefully
from
the
front
page
clearly
giving
some
kind
speech
Harry
did
not
speak
Hermione
all
through
Charms
but
when
they
entered
Transfiguration
forgot
about
being
cross
with
her
Professor
Umbridge
and
her
clipboard
were
sitting
corner
and
the
sight
her
drove
the
memory
breakfast
right
out
his
head
Excellent
whispered
Ron
they
sat
down
their
usual
seats
Let
see
Umbridge
get
what
she
deserves
Professor
McGonagall
marched
into
the
room
without
giving
the
slightest
indication
that
she
knew
Professor
Umbridge
was
there
That
will
she
said
and
silence
fell
immediately
Finnigan
kindly
come
here
and
hand
back
the
homework
Miss
Brown
please
take
this
box
mice
don
silly
girl
they
won
hurt
you
and
hand
one
each
student
Hem
hem
said
Professor
Umbridge
employing
the
same
silly
little
cough
she
had
used
interrupt
Dumbledore
the
first
night
term
Professor
McGonagall
ignored
her
Seamus
handed
back
Harry
essay
Harry
took
without
looking
him
and
saw
his
relief
that
had
managed
Right
then
everyone
listen
closely
Dean
Thomas
you
that
the
mouse
again
shall
put
you
detention
most
you
have
now
successfully
Vanished

and
even
those
who
were
left
with
certain
amount
shell
have
got
the
gist
the
spell
Today
shall
Hem
hem
said
Professor
Umbridge
Yes
said
Professor
McGonagall
turning
round
her
eyebrows
close
together
they
seemed
form
one
long
severe
line
was
just
wondering
Professor
whether
you
received
note
telling
you
the
date
and
time
your
inspec
Obviously
received
would
have
asked
you
what
you
are
doing
classroom
said
Professor
McGonagall
turning
her
back
firmly
Professor
Umbridge
Many
the
students
exchanged
looks
glee
was
saying
today
shall
practising
the
altogether
more
difficult
Vanishment
mice
Now
the
Vanishing
Spell
Hem

said
Professor
McGonagall
cold
fury
turning
Professor
Umbridge
how
you
expect
gain
idea
usual
teaching
methods
you
continue
interrupt
You
see
not
generally
permit
people
talk
when
talking
Professor
Umbridge
looked
though
she
had
just
been
slapped
the
face
She
did
not
speak
but
straightened
the
parchment
her
clipboard
and
began
scribbling
furiously
Looking
supremely
unconcerned
Professor
McGonagall
addressed
the
class
once
more
was
saying
the
Vanishing
Spell
becomes
more
difficult
with
the
complexity
the
animal
Vanished
The
snail
invertebrate
does
not
present
much
challenge
the
mouse
mammal
offers
much
greater
one
This
not
therefore
magic
you
can
accomplish
with
your
mind
onyour
dinner
you
know
the
incantation
let
see
what
you
can
How
she
can
lecture
about
not
losing
temper
with
Umbridge
Harry
muttered
Ron
under
his
breath
but
was
grinning
his
anger
with
Professor
McGonagall
had
quite
evaporated
Professor
Umbridge
did
not
follow
Professor
McGonagall
around
the
class
she
had
followed
Professor
Trelawney
perhaps
she
realised
Professor
McGonagall
would
not
permit
She
did
however
take
many
more
notes
while
sitting
her
corner
and
when
Professor
McGonagall
finally
told
them
all
pack
away
she
rose
with
grim
expression
her
face
Well
start
said
Ron
holding
long
wriggling
mouse
tail
and
dropping
back
into
the
box
Lavender
was
passing
around
they
filed
out
the
classroom
Harry
saw
Professor
Umbridge
approach
the
teacher
desk
nudged
Ron
who
nudged
Hermione
turn
and
the
three
them
deliberately
fell
back
eavesdrop
How
long
have
you
been
teaching
Hogwarts
Professor
Umbridge
asked
Thirty
nine
years
this
December
said
Professor
McGonagall
brusquely
snapping
her
bag
shut
Professor
Umbridge
made
note
Very
well
she
said
you
will
receive
the
results
your
inspection
ten
days
time
can
hardly
wait
said
Professor
McGonagall
coldly
indifferent
voice
and
she
strode
off
towards
the
door
Hurry
you
three
she
added
sweeping
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
before
her
Harry
could
not
help
giving
her
faint
smile
and
could
have
sworn
received
one
return
had
thought
that
the
next
time
would
see
Umbridge
would
his
detention
that
evening
but
was
wrong
When
they
walked
down
the
lawns
towards
the
Forest
for
Care
Magical
Creatures
they
found
her
and
her
clipboard
waiting
for
them
beside
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
You
not
usually
take
this
class
that
correct
Harry
heard
her
ask
they
arrived
the
trestle
table
where
the
group
captive
Bowtruckles
were
scrabbling
around
for
woodlice
like
many
living
twigs
Quite
correct
said
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
hands
behind
her
back
and
bouncing
the
balls
her
feet
substitute
teacher
standing
for
Professor
Hagrid
Harry
exchanged
uneasy
looks
with
Ron
and
Hermione
Malfoy
was
whispering
with
Crabbe
and
Goyle
would
surely
love
this
opportunity
tell
tales
Hagrid
member
the
Ministry
Hmm
said
Professor
Umbridge
dropping
her
voice
though
Harry
could
still
hear
her
quite
clearly
wonder
the
Headmaster
seems
strangely
reluctant
give
any
information
the
matter
can
you
tell
what
causing
Professor
Hagrid
very
extended
leave
absence
Harry
saw
Malfoy
look
eagerly
and
watch
Umbridge
and
Grubbly
Plank
closely
Fraid
can
said
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
breezily
Don
know
anything
more
about
than
you
Got
owl
from
Dumbledore
would
like
couple
weeks
teaching
work
accepted
That
much
know
Well
shall
get
started
then
Yes
please
said
Professor
Umbridge
scribbling
her
clipboard
Umbridge
took
different
tack
this
class
and
wandered
amongst
the
students
questioning
them
magical
creatures
Most
people
were
able
answer
well
and
Harry
spirits
lifted
somewhat
least
the
class
was
not
letting
Hagrid
down
Overall
said
Professor
Umbridge
returning
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
side
after
lengthy
interrogation
Dean
Thomas
how
you
temporary
member
staff
objective
outsider
suppose
you
might
say
how
you
find
Hogwarts
you
feel
you
receive
enough
support
from
the
school
management
yes
Dumbledore
excellent
said
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
heartily
Yes
very
happy
with
the
way
things
are
run
very
happy
indeed
Looking
politely
incredulous
Umbridge
made
tiny
note
her
clipboard
and
went
And
what
are
you
planning
cover
with
this
class
this
year
assuming
course
that
Professor
Hagrid
does
not
return
take
them
through
the
creatures
that
most
often
come
said
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
Not
much
left
they
studied
unicorns
and
Nifflers
thought
cover
Porlocks
and
Kneazles
make
sure
they
can
recognise
Crups
and
Knarls
you
know
Well
youseem
know
what
you
doing
any
rate
said
Professor
Umbridge
making
very
obvious
tick
her
clipboard
Harry
did
not
like
the
emphasis
she
put
you
and
liked
even
less
when
she
put
her
next
question
Goyle
Now
hear
there
have
been
injuries
this
class
Goyle
gave
stupid
grin
Malfoy
hastened
answer
the
question
That
was
said
was
slashed
Hippogriff
Hippogriff
said
Professor
Umbridge
now
scribbling
frantically
Only
because
was
too
stupid
listen
what
Hagrid
told
him
said
Harry
angrily
Both
Ron
and
Hermione
groaned
Professor
Umbridge
turned
her
head
slowly
Harry
direction
Another
night
detention
think
she
said
softly
Well
thank
you
very
much
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
think
that
all
need
here
You
will
receiving
the
results
your
inspection
within
ten
days
Jolly
good
said
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
and
Professor
Umbridge
set
off
back
across
the
lawn
the
castle
was
nearly
midnight
when
Harry
left
Umbridge
office
that
night
his
hand
now
bleeding
severely
that
was
staining
the
scarf
had
wrapped
around
expected
the
common
room
empty
when
returned
but
Ron
and
Hermione
had
sat
waiting
for
him
was
pleased
see
them
especially
Hermione
was
disposed
sympathetic
rather
than
critical
Here
she
said
anxiously
pushing
small
bowl
yellow
liquid
towards
him
soak
your
hand
that
solution
strained
and
pickled
Murtlap
tentacles
should
help
Harry
placed
his
bleeding
aching
hand
into
the
bowl
and
experienced
wonderful
feeling
relief
Crookshanks
curled
around
his
legs
purring
loudly
then
leapt
into
his
lap
and
settled
down
Thanks
said
gratefully
scratching
behind
Crookshanks
ears
with
his
left
hand
still
reckon
you
should
complain
about
this
said
Ron
low
voice
said
Harry
flatly
McGonagall
would
nuts
she
knew
Yeah
she
probably
would
said
Harry
dully
And
how
long
you
reckon
take
Umbridge
pass
another
decree
saying
anyone
who
complains
about
the
High
Inquisitor
gets
sacked
immediately
Ron
opened
his
mouth
retort
but
nothing
came
out
and
after
moment
closed
again
defeated
She
awful
woman
said
Hermione
small
voice
Awful
You
know
was
just
saying
Ron
when
you
came
got
something
about
her
suggested
poison
said
Ron
grimly
mean
something
about
what
dreadful
teacher
she
and
how
not
going
learn
any
Defence
from

Hermione
tentatively
You

shot
slightly
nervous

Harry
and
then
plunged
was
thinking
that
maybe
the
time

Harry
suspiciously

Ron

Hermione
Harry
and
Ron
goggled
her

think
there
was
anything
the
universe
more
important
than
homework
said
Ron
Don
silly
course
there
said
Hermione
and
Harry
saw
with
ominous
feeling
that
her
face
was
suddenly
alight
with
the
kind
fervour
that
usually
inspired
her
about
preparing
ourselves
like
Harry
said
Umbridge

Hermione

the
spells
and
correct
going
wrong
you
talking
about
Lupin
Harry
began
not
talking
about
Lupin
said
Hermione
too
busy
with
the
Order
and
anyway
the
most
could
see
him
during
Hogsmeade
weekends
and
that
not
nearly
often
enough
Who
then
said
Harry
frowning
her
Hermione
heaved
very
deep
sigh
Isn
obvious
she
said
talking
aboutyou
Harry
There
was
moment
silence
light
night
breeze
rattled
the
windowpanes
behind
Ron
and
the
fire
guttered
About
what
said
Harry
talking
aboutyou
teaching
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
Harry
stared
her
Then
turned
Ron
ready
exchange
the
exasperated
looks
they
sometimes
shared
when
Hermione
elaborated
far
fetched
schemes
like
Harry
consternation
however
Ron
did
not
look
exasperated
was
frowning
slightly
apparently
thinking
Then
said
That
idea
What
idea
said
Harry
You

Ron
Teaching
But
Harry
was
grinning
now
sure
the
pair
them
were
pulling
his
leg
But

Harry

best

Hermione
said
Harry

broadly
than

Hermione
coolly
You

our
third

only

But

about

Harry
Think
what

How
you
mean
You
know
what
not
sure

someone

stupid

Ron
said
Hermione
smirking
slightly
turned
Harry
Let
think

pulling
face
like
Goyle

the
Philosopher
Stone
from
You

Who
But

Harry

Ron
louder

Time

Last
year
Ron
said
almost
shouting
now
you
fought
off
You
Know
Whoagain
Listen
said
Harry
almost
angrily
because
Ron
and
Hermione
were
both
smirking
now
Just
listen
all
right
sounds
great
when
you
say
like
that
but
all
that
stuff
was
luck
didn
know
what
was
doing
half
the
time
didn
plan
any
just
did
whatever
Icould
think
and
nearly
always
had
help
Ron
and
Hermione
were
still
smirking
and
Harry
felt
his
temper
rise
wasn
even
sure
why
was
feeling
angry
Don
sit
there
grinning
like
you
know
better
than
was
there
wasn
said
heatedly
know
what
went
all
right
And
didn
get
through
any
that
because
was
brilliant
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
got
through
all
because
because
help
came
the
right
time
because
guessed
right
but
just
blundered
through
all
didn
have
clue
what
was
doing
STOP
LAUGHING
The
bowl
Murtlap
essence
fell
the
floor
and
smashed
became
aware
that
was
his
feet
though
couldn
remember
standing
Crookshanks
streaked
away
under
sofa
Ron
and
Hermione
smiles
had
vanished
You
don
know
what
like
You
neither
you
you
never
had
face
him
have
you
You
think
just
memorizing
bunch
spells
and
throwing
them
him
like
you
class
something
The
whole
time
you
sure
you
know
there
nothing
between
you
and
dying
except
your
own
your
own
brain
guts
whatever
like
you
can
think
straight
when
you
know
you
about
nanosecond
from
being
murdered
tortured
watching
your
friends
die
they
never
taught
that
their
classes
what
like
deal
with
things
like
that
and
you
two
sit
there
acting
like
clever
little
boy
standing
here
alive
like
Diggory
was
stupid
like
messed
you
just
don
get
that
could
just
easily
have
been

have
been
Voldemort
hadn
needed

saying
anything
like
that
mate
said
Ron
looking
aghast
weren
having
Diggory
didn
you
got
the
wrong
end
the
looked
helplessly
Hermione
whose
face
was
stricken
Harry
she
said
timidly
don
you
see
This
this
exactly
why
need
you
need
know
what
really
like
facing
him
facing
Voldemort
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
said
Voldemort
name
and
was
this
more
than
anything
else
that
calmed
Harry
Still
breathing
hard
sank
back
into
his
chair
becoming
aware
did
that
his
hand
was
throbbing
horribly
again
wished
had
not
smashed
the
bowl
Murtlap
essence
Well
think
about
said
Hermione
quietly
Please
Harry
could
not
think
anything
say
was
feeling
ashamed
his
outburst
already
nodded
hardly
aware
what
was
agreeing
Hermione
stood
Well
off
bed
she
said
voice
that
was
clearly
natural
she
could
make
Erm
night
Ron
had
got
his
feet
too
Coming
said
awkwardly
Harry
Yeah
said
Harry
minute
just
clear
this
indicated
the
smashed
bowl
the
floor
Ron
nodded
and
left
Reparo
Harry
muttered
pointing
his
wand
the
broken
pieces
china
They
flew
back
together
good
new
but
there
was
returning
the
Murtlap
essence
the
bowl
was
suddenly
tired
was
tempted
sink
back
into
his
armchair
and
sleep
there
but
instead
forced
himself
his
feet
and
followed
Ron
upstairs
His
restless
night
was
punctuated
once
more
dreams
long
corridors
and
locked
doors
and
awoke
next
day
with
his
scar
prickling
again
THE
HOG
HEAD
Hermione
made
mention
Harry
giving
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lessons
for
two
whole
weeks
after
her
original
suggestion
Harry
detentions
with
Umbridge
were
finally
over
doubted
whether
the
words
now
etched
into
the
back
his
hand
would
ever
fade
entirely
Ron
had
had
four
more
Quidditch
practices
and
not
been
shouted
during
the
last
two
and
all
three
them
had
managed
Vanish
their
mice
Transfiguration
Hermione
had
actually
progressed
Vanishing
kittens
before
the
subject
was
broached
again
wild
blustery
evening
the
end
September
when
the
three
them
were
sitting
the
library
looking
potion
ingredients
for
Snape
was
wondering
Hermione
said
suddenly
whether
you
thought
any
more
about
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
Harry
Course
have
said
Harry
grumpily
can
forget
can
with
that
hag
teaching
meant
the
idea
Ron
and
had
Ron
cast
her
alarmed
threatening
kind
look
She
frowned
him
all
right
the
idea
had
then
about
you
teaching
Harry
did
not
answer
once
pretended
perusing
page
ofAsiatic
Anti
Venoms
because
did
not
want
say
what
was
his
mind
had
given
the
matter
great
deal
thought
over
the
past
fortnight
Sometimes
seemed
insane
idea
just
had
the
night
Hermione
had
proposed
but
others
had
found
himself
thinking
about
the
spells
that
had
served
him
best
his
various
encounters
with
Dark
creatures
and
Death
Eaters
found
himself
fact
subconsciously
planning
lessons
Well
said
slowly
when
could
longer
pretend
findAsiatic
Anti
Venomsinteresting
yeah
thought
about
bit
And
said
Hermione
eagerly
dunno
said
Harry
playing
for
time
looked
Ron
thought
was
good
idea
from
the
start
said
Ron
who
seemed
keener
join
this
conversation
now
that
was
sure
Harry
was
not
going
start
shouting
again
Harry
shifted
uncomfortably
his
chair
You
did
listen
what
said
about
load
being
luck
didn
you
Yes
Harry
said
Hermione
gently
but
all
the
same
there
point
pretending
that
you
not
good
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
because
you
are
You
were
the
only
person
last
year
who
could
throw
off
the
Imperius
Curse
completely
you
can
produce
Patronus
you
can
all
sortsof
stuff
that
full
grown
wizards
can
Viktor
always
said
Ron
looked
round
her
fast
appeared
crick
his
neck
Rubbing
said
Yeah
What
did
Vicky
say
said
Hermione
bored
voice
said
Harry
knew
how
stuff
even
didn
and
was
the
final
year
Durmstrang
Ron
was
looking
Hermione
suspiciously
You
not
still
contact
with
him
are
you
what
said
Hermione
coolly
though
her
face
was
little
pink
can
have
pen
pal
didn
only
want
your
pen
pal
said
Ron
accusingly
Hermione
shook
her
head
exasperatedly
and
ignoring
Ron
who
was
continuing
watch
her
said
Harry
Well
what
you
think
Will
you
teach
Just
you
and
Ron
yeah
Well
said
Hermione
looking
mite
anxious
again
Well
now
don
fly
off
the
handle
again
Harry
please
but
really
think
you
ought
teach
anyone
who
wants
learn
mean
talking
about
defending
ourselves
against
Voldemort
don
pathetic
Ron
doesn
seem
fair
don
offer
the
chance
other
people
Harry
considered
this
for
moment
then
said
Yeah
but
doubt
anyone
except
you
two
would
want
taught
nutter
remember
Well
think
you
might
surprised
how
many
people
would
interested
hearing
what
you
got
say
said
Hermione
seriously
Look
she
leaned
towards
him
Ron
who
was
still
watching
her
with
frown
his
face
leaned
forwards
listen
too
you
know
the
first
weekend
October
Hogsmeade
weekend
How
would
tell
anyone
who
interested
meet
the
village
and
can
talk
over
Why
have
outside
school
said
Ron
Because
said
Hermione
returning
the
diagram
the
Chinese
Chomping
Cabbage
she
was
copying
don
think
Umbridge
would
very
happy
she
found
out
what
were
Harry
had
been
looking
forward
the
weekend
trip
into
Hogsmeade
but
there
was
one
thing
worrying
him
Sirius
had
maintained
stony
silence
since
had
appeared
the
fire
the
beginning
September
Harry
knew
they
had
made
him
angry
saying
they
didn
want
him
come
but
still
worried
from
time
time
that
Sirius
might
throw
caution
the
winds
and
turn
anyway
What
were
they
going
the
great
black
dog
came
bounding
the
street
towards
them
Hogsmeade
perhaps
under
the
nose
Draco
Malfoy
Well
you
can
blame
him
for
wanting
get
out
and
about
said
Ron
when
Harry
discussed
his
fears
with
him
and
Hermione
mean
been
the
run
for
over
two
years
hasn
and
know
that
can
have
been
laugh
but
least
was
free
wasn
And
now
just
shut
all
the
time
with
that
ghastly
elf
Hermione
scowled
Ron
but
otherwise
ignored
the
slight
Kreacher
The
trouble
she
said
Harry
until
Voldemort
for
heaven
ssake
Ron
comes
out
into
the
open
Sirius
going
have
stay
hidden
isn
mean
the
stupid
Ministry
isn
going
realise
Sirius
innocent
until
they
accept
that
Dumbledore
been
telling
the
truth
about
him
all
along
And
once
the
fools
start
catching
real
Death
Eaters
again
obvious
Sirius
isn
one
mean
hasn
got
the
Mark
for
one
thing
don
reckon
stupid
enough
turn
said
Ron
bracingly
Dumbledore
mad
did
and
Sirius
listens
Dumbledore
even
doesn
like
what
hears
When
Harry
continued
look
worried
Hermione
said
Listen
Ron
and
have
been
sounding
out
people
who
thought
might
want
learn
some
proper
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
and
there
are
couple
who
seem
interested
told
them
meet
Hogsmeade
Right
said
Harry
vaguely
his
mind
still
Sirius
Don
worry
Harry
Hermione
said
quietly
You
got
enough
your
plate
without
Sirius
too
She
was
quite
right
course
was
barely
keeping
with
his
homework
though
was
doing
much
better
now
that
was
longer
spending
every
evening
detention
with
Umbridge
Ron
was
even
further
behind
with
his
work
than
Harry
because
while
they
both
had
Quidditch
practice
twice
week
Ron
also
had
his
prefect
duties
However
Hermione
who
was
taking
more
subjects
than
either
them
had
not
only
finished
all
her
homework
but
was
also
finding
time
knit
more
elf
clothes
Harry
had
admit
that
she
was
getting
better
was
now
almost
always
possible
distinguish
between
the
hats
and
the
socks
The
morning
the
Hogsmeade
visit
dawned
bright
but
windy
After
breakfast
they
queued
front
Filch
who
matched
their
names
the
long
list
students
who
had
permission
from
their
parents
guardian
visit
the
village
With
slight
pang
Harry
remembered
that
hadn
been
for
Sirius
would
not
have
been
going
all
When
Harry
reached
Filch
the
caretaker
gave
great
sniff
though
trying
detect
whiff
something
from
Harry
Then
gave
curt
nod
that
set
his
jowls
aquiver
again
and
Harry
walked
out
the
stone
steps
and
the
cold
sunlit
day
why
was
Filch
sniffing
you
asked
Ron
Harry
and
Hermione
set
off
brisk
pace
down
the
wide
drive
the
gates
suppose
was
checking
for
the
smell
Dungbombs
said
Harry
with
small
laugh
forgot
tell
you
And
recounted
the
story
sending
his
letter
Sirius
and
Filch
bursting
seconds
later
demanding
see
the
letter
his
slight
surprise
Hermione
found
this
story
highly
interesting
much
more
indeed
than
did
himself
said
was
tipped
off
you
were
ordering
Dungbombs
But
who
tipped
him
off
dunno
said
Harry
shrugging
Maybe
Malfoy
think
was
laugh
They
walked
between
the
tall
stone
pillars
topped
with
winged
boars
and
turned
left
the
road
into
the
village
the
wind
whipping
their
hair
into
their
eyes
Malfoy
said
Hermione
sceptically
Well
yes
maybe
And
she
remained
deep
thought
all
the
way
into
the
outskirts
Hogsmeade
Where
are
going
anyway
Harry
asked
The
Three
Broomsticks
said
Hermione
coming
out
her
reverie
always
packed
and
really
noisy
told
the
others
meet
the
Hog
Head
that
other
pub
you
know
the
one
not
the
main
road
think
bit
you
know
dodgy
but
students
don
normally
there
don
think
overheard
They
walked
down
the
main
street
past
Zonko
Wizarding
Joke
Shop
where
they
were
not
surprised
see
Fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
past
the
post
office
from
which
owls
issued
regular
intervals
and
turned
side
street
the
top
which
stood
small
inn
battered
wooden
sign
hung
from
rusty
bracket
over
the
door
with
picture
wild
boar
severed
head
leaking
blood
the
white
cloth
around
The
sign
creaked
the
wind
they
approached
All
three
them
hesitated
outside
the
door
Well
come
said
Hermione
slightly
nervously
Harry
led
the
way
inside
was
not
all
like
the
Three
Broomsticks
whose
large
bar
gave
impression
gleaming
warmth
and
cleanliness
The
Hog
Head
bar
comprised
one
small
dingy
and
very
dirty
room
that
smelled
strongly
something
that
might
have
been
goats
The
bay
windows
were
encrusted
with
grime
that
very
little
daylight
could
permeate
the
room
which
was
lit
instead
with
the
stubs
candles
sitting
rough
wooden
tables
The
floor
seemed
first
glance
compressed
earth
though
Harry
stepped
realised
that
there
was
stone
beneath
what
seemed
the
accumulated
filth
centuries
Harry
remembered
Hagrid
mentioning
this
pub
his
first
year
Yeh
get
lot
funny
folk
the
Hog
Head
had
said
explaining
how
had
won
dragon
egg
from
hooded
stranger
there
the
time
Harry
had
wondered
why
Hagrid
had
not
found
odd
that
the
stranger
kept
his
face
hidden
throughout
their
encounter
now
saw
that
keeping
your
face
hidden
was
something
fashion
the
Hog
Head
There
was
man
the
bar
whose
whole
head
was
wrapped
dirty
grey
bandages
though
was
still
managing
gulp
endless
glasses
some
smoking
fiery
substance
through
slit
over
his
mouth
two
figures
shrouded
hoods
sat
table
one
the
windows
Harry
might
have
thought
them
Dementors
they
had
not
been
talking
strong
Yorkshire
accents
and
shadowy
corner
beside
the
fireplace
sat
witch
with
thick
black
veil
that
fell
her
toes
They
could
just
see
the
tip
her
nose
because
caused
the
veil
toprotrude
slightly
don
know
about
this
Hermione
Harry
muttered
they
crossed
the
bar
was
looking
particularly
the
heavily
veiled
witch
Has
occurred
you
Umbridge
might
under
that
Hermione
cast
appraising
eye
over
the
veiled
figure
Umbridge
shorter
than
that
woman
she
said
quietly
And
anyway
even
Umbridge
does
come
here
there
nothing
she
can
stop
Harry
because
double
and
triple
checked
the
school
rules
not
out
bounds
specifically
asked
Professor
Flitwick
whether
students
were
allowed
come
the
Hog
Head
and
said
yes
but
advised
strongly
bring
our
own
glasses
And
looked
everything
can
think
about
study
groups
and
homework
groups
and
they
definitely
allowed
just
don
think
good
idea
weparade
what
doing
said
Harry
drily
especially
not
exactly
homework
group
you
planning
The
barman
sidled
towards
them
out
back
room
was
grumpy
looking
old
man
with
great
deal
long
grey
hair
and
beard
was
tall
and
thin
and
looked
vaguely
familiar
Harry
What
grunted
Three
Butterbeers
please
said
Hermione
The
man
reached
beneath
the
counter
and
pulled
three
very
dusty
very
dirty
bottles
which
slammed
the
bar
Six
Sickles
said
get
them
said
Harry
quickly
passing
over
the
silver
The
barman
eyes
travelled
over
Harry
resting
for
fraction
second
his
scar
Then
turned
away
and
deposited
Harry
money
ancient
wooden
till
whose
drawer
slid
open
automatically
receive
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
retreated
the
furthest
table
from
the
bar
and
sat
down
looking
around
The
man
the
dirty
grey
bandages
rapped
the
counter
with
his
knuckles
and
received
another
smoking
drink
from
the
barman
You
know
what
Ron
murmured
looking
over
the
bar
with
enthusiasm
could
order
anything
liked
here
bet
that
bloke
would
sell
anything
wouldn
care
always
wanted
try
Firewhisky
You
are
prefect
snarled
Hermione
said
Ron
the
smile
fading
from
his
face
Yeah
who
did
you
say
supposed
meeting
Harry
asked
wrenching
open
the
rusty
top
his
Butterbeer
and
taking
swig
Just
couple
people
Hermione
repeated
checking
her
watch
and
looking
anxiously
towards
the
door
told
them
here
about
now
and
sure
they
all
know
where
look
this
might
them
now
The
door
the
pub
had
opened
thick
band
dusty
sunlight
split
the
room
two
for
moment
and
then
vanished
blocked
the
incoming
rush
crowd
people
First
came
Neville
with
Dean
and
Lavender
who
were
closely
followed
Parvati
and
Padma
Patil
with
Harry
stomach
did
back
flip
Cho
and
one
her
usually
giggling
girlfriends
then
her
own
and
looking
dreamy
she
might
have
walked
accident
Luna
Lovegood
then
Katie
Bell
Alicia
Spinnet
and
Angelina
Johnson
Colin
and
Dennis
Creevey
Ernie
Macmillan
Justin
Finch
Fletchley
Hannah
Abbott
Hufflepuff
girl
with
long
plait
down
her
back
whose
name
Harry
did
not
know
three
Ravenclaw
boys
was
pretty
sure
were
called
Anthony
Goldstein
Michael
Corner
and
Terry
Boot
Ginny
closely
followed
tall
skinny
blond
boy
with
upturned
nose
whom
Harry
recognised
vaguely
being
member
the
Hufflepuff
Quidditch
team
and
bringing
the
rear
Fred
and
George
Weasley
with
their
friend
Lee
Jordan
all
three
whom
were
carrying
large
paper
bags
crammed
with
Zonko
merchandise
couple
people
said
Harry
hoarsely
Hermione
couple
people
Yes
well
the
idea
seemed
quite
popular
said
Hermione
happily
Ron
you
want
pull
some
more
chairs
The
barman
had
frozen
the
act
wiping
out
glass
with
rag
filthy
looked
though
had
never
been
washed
Possibly
had
never
seen
his
pub
full
said
Fred
reaching
the
bar
first
and
counting
his
companions
quickly
could
have
twenty
five
Butterbeers
please
The
barman
glared
him
for
moment
then
throwing
down
his
rag
irritably
though
had
been
interrupted
something
very
important
started
passing
dusty
Butterbeers
from
under
the
bar
Cheers
said
Fred
handing
them
out
Cough
everyone
haven
got
enough
gold
for
all
these
Harry
watched
numbly
the
large
chattering
group
took
their
beers
from
Fred
and
rummaged
their
robes
find
coins
could
not
imagine
what
all
these
people
had
turned
for
until
the
horrible
thought
occurred
him
that
they
might
expecting
some
kind
speech
which
rounded
Hermione
What
have
you
been
telling
people
said
low
voice
What
are
they
expecting
told
you
they
just
want
hear
what
you
got
say
said
Hermione
soothingly
but
Harry
continued
look
her
furiously
that
she
added
quickly
you
don
have
anything
yet
speak
them
first
Harry
said
Neville
beaming
and
taking
seat
opposite
him
Harry
tried
smile
back
but
did
not
speak
his
mouth
was
exceptionally
dry
Cho
had
just
smiled
him
and
sat
down
Ron
right
Her
friend
who
had
curly
reddish
blonde
hair
did
not
smile
but
gave
Harry
thoroughly
mistrustful
look
which
plainly
told
him
that
given
her
way
she
would
not
here
all
twos
and
threes
the
new
arrivals
settled
around
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
some
looking
rather
excited
others
curious
Luna
Lovegood
gazing
dreamily
into
space
When
everybody
had
pulled
chair
the
chatter
died
out
Every
eye
was
upon
Harry
said
Hermione
her
voice
slightly
higher
than
usual
out
nerves
Well
The
group
focused
its
attention
her
instead
though
eyes
continued
dart
back
regularly
Harry
Well
erm
well
you
know
why
you
here
Erm
well
Harry
here
had
the
idea
mean
Harry
had
thrown
her
sharp
look
had
the
idea
that
might
good
people
who
wanted
study
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
and
mean
really
study
you
know
not
the
rubbish
that
Umbridge
doing
with
Hermione
voice
became
suddenly
much
stronger
and
more
confident
because
nobody
could
call
that
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
Hear
hear
said
Anthony
Goldstein
and
Hermione
looked
heartened
Well
thought
would
good
well
took
matters
into
our
own
hands
She
paused
looked
sideways
Harry
and
went
And
that
mean
learning
how
defend
ourselves
properly
not
just
theory
but
doing
the
real
spells
You
want
pass
your
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
too
though
bet
said
Michael
Corner
who
was
watching
her
closely
course
said
Hermione
once
But
more
than
that
want
properly
trained
defence
because
because
she
took
great
breath
and
finished
because
Lord
Voldemort
back
The
reaction
was
immediate
and
predictable
Cho
friend
shrieked
and
slopped
Butterbeer
down
herself
Terry
Boot
gave
kind
involuntary
twitch
Padma
Patil
shuddered
and
Neville
gave
odd
yelp
that
managed
turn
into
cough
All
them
however
looked
fixedly
even
eagerly
Harry
Well
that
the
plan
anyway
said
Hermione
you
want
join
need
decide
how
going
Where
the
proof
You
Know
Who
back
said
the
blond
Hufflepuff
player
rather
aggressive
voice
Well
Dumbledore
believes
Hermione
began
You
mean
Dumbledore
believeshim
said
the
blond
boy
nodding
Harry
Who
areyou
said
Ron
rather
rudely
Zacharias
Smith
said
the
boy
and
think
got
the
right
know
exactly
what
makes
him
say
You
Know
Who
back
Look
said
Hermione
intervening
swiftly
that
really
not
what
this
meeting
was
supposed
about
Hermione
said
Harry
had
just
dawned
him
why
there
were
many
people
there
thought
Hermione
should
have
seen
this
coming
Some
these
people
maybe
even
most
them
had
turned
the
hopes
hearing
Harry
story
firsthand
What
makes
say
You
Know
Who
back
repeated
looking
Zacharias
straight
the
face
saw
him
But
Dumbledore
told
the
whole
school
what
happened
last
year
and
you
didn
believe
him
you
won
believe
and
not
wasting
afternoon
trying
convince
anyone
The
whole
group
seemed
have
held
its
breath
while
Harry
spoke
Harry
had
the
impression
that
even
the
barman
was
listening
was
wiping
the
same
glass
with
the
filthy
rag
making
steadily
dirtier
Zacharias
said
dismissively
All
Dumbledore
told
last
year
was
that
Cedric
Diggory
got
killed
You
Know
Who
and
that
you
brought
Diggory
body
back
Hogwarts
didn
give
details
didn
tell
exactly
how
Diggory
got
murdered
think
all
like
know
you
come
hear
exactly
what
looks
like
when
Voldemort
murders
someone
can
help
you
Harry
said
His
temper
always
close
the
surface
these
days
was
rising
again
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
Zacharias
Smith
aggressive
face
and
was
determined
not
look
Cho
don
want
talk
about
Cedric
Diggory
all
right
that
what
you
here
for
you
might
well
clear
out
cast
angry
look
Hermione
direction
This
was
felt
all
her
fault
she
had
decided
display
him
like
some
sort
freak
and
course
they
had
all
turned
see
just
how
wild
his
story
was
But
none
them
left
their
seats
not
even
Zacharias
Smith
though
continued
gaze
intently
Harry
said
Hermione
her
voice
very
high
pitched
again
like
was
saying
you
want
learn
some
defence
then
need
work
out
how
going
how
often
going
meet
and
where
going
true
interrupted
the
girl
with
the
long
plait
down
her
back
looking
Harry
that
you
can
produce
Patronus
There
was
murmur
interest
around
the
group
this
Yeah
said
Harry
slightly
defensively
corporeal
Patronus
The
phrase
stirred
something
Harry
memory
you
don
know
Madam
Bones
you
asked
The
girl
smiled
She
auntie
she
said
Susan
Bones
She
told
about
your
hearing
really
true
You
make
stag
Patronus
Yes
said
Harry
Blimey
Harry
said
Lee
looking
deeply
impressed
never
knew
that
Mum
told
Ron
not
spread
around
said
Fred
grinning
Harry
She
said
you
got
enough
attention
was
She
not
wrong
mumbled
Harry
and
couple
people
laughed
The
veiled
witch
sitting
alone
shifted
very
slightly
her
seat
And
did
you
kill
Basilisk
with
that
sword
Dumbledore
office
demanded
Terry
Boot
That
what
one
the
portraits
the
wall
told
when
was
there
last
year
yeah
did
yeah
said
Harry
Justin
Finch
Fletchley
whistled
the
Creevey
brothers
exchanged
awestruck
looks
and
Lavender
Brown
said
Wow
softly
Harry
was
feeling
slightly
hot
around
the
collar
now
was
determinedly
looking
anywhere
but
Cho
And
our
first
year
said
Neville
the
group
large
saved
that
Philological
Stone
Philosopher
hissed
Hermione
Yes
that
from
You
Know
Who
finished
Neville
Hannah
Abbott
eyes
were
round
Galleons
And
that
not
mention
said
Cho
Harry
eyes
snapped
across
her
she
was
looking
him
smiling
his
stomach
did
another
somersault
all
the
tasks
had
get
through
the
Triwizard
Tournament
last
year
getting
past
dragons
and
merpeople
and
Acromantula
and
things
There
was
murmur
impressed
agreement
around
the
table
Harry
insides
were
squirming
was
trying
arrange
his
face
that
did
not
look
too
pleased
with
himself
The
fact
that
Cho
had
just
praised
him
made
much
much
harder
for
him
say
the
thing
had
sworn
himself
would
tell
them
Look
said
and
everyone
fell
silent
once
don
want
sound
like
trying
modest
anything
but
had
lot
help
with
all
that
stuff
Not
with
the
dragon
you
didn
said
Michael
Corner
once
That
was
seriously
cool
bit
flying
Yeah
well
said
Harry
feeling
would
churlish
disagree
And
nobody
helped
you
get
rid
those
Dementors
this
summer
said
Susan
Bones
said
Harry
know
did
bits
without
help
but
the
point
trying
make
Are
you
trying
weasel
out
showing
any
this
stuff
said
Zacharias
Smith
Here
idea
said
Ron
loudly
before
Harry
could
speak
why
don
you
shut
your
mouth
Perhaps
the
word
weasel
had
affected
Ron
particularly
strongly
any
case
was
now
looking
Zacharias
though
would
like
nothing
better
than
thump
him
Zacharias
flushed
Well
all
turned
learn
from
him
and
now
telling
can
really
any
said
That
not
what
said
snarled
Fred
Would
you
like
clean
out
your
ears
for
you
enquired
George
pulling
long
and
lethal
looking
metal
instrument
from
inside
one
the
Zonko
bags
any
part
your
body
really
not
fussy
where
stick
this
said
Fred
Yes
well
said
Hermione
hastily
moving
the
point
are
agreed
want
take
lessons
from
Harry
There
was
murmur
general
agreement
Zacharias
folded
his
arms
and
said
nothing
though
perhaps
this
was
because
was
too
busy
keeping
eye
the
instrument
Fred
hand
Right
said
Hermione
looking
relieved
that
something
had
last
been
settled
Well
then
the
next
question
how
often
really
don
think
there
any
point
meeting
less
than
once
week
Hang
said
Angelina
need
make
sure
this
doesn
clash
with
our
Quidditch
practice
said
Cho
nor
with
ours
Nor
ours
added
Zacharias
Smith
sure
can
find
night
that
suits
everyone
said
Hermione
slightly
impatiently
but
you
know
this
rather
important
talking
about
learning
defend
ourselves
against
Voldemort
Death
Eaters
Well
said
barked
Ernie
Macmillan
who
Harry
had
been
expecting
speak
long
before
this
Personally
think
this
really
important
possibly
more
important
than
anything
else
this
year
even
with
our
coming
looked
around
impressively
though
waiting
for
people
cry
Surely
not
When
nobody
spoke
went
personally
loss
see
why
the
Ministry
has
foisted
such
useless
teacher
this
critical
period
Obviously
they
are
denial
about
the
return
You
Know
Who
but
give
teacher
who
trying
actively
prevent
fromusing
defensive
spells
think
the
reason
Umbridge
doesn
want
trained
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
said
Hermione
that
she
got
some
some
mad
idea
that
Dumbledore
could
use
the
students
the
school
kind
private
army
She
thinks
mobilize
against
the
Ministry
Nearly
everybody
looked
stunned
this
news
everybody
except
Luna
Lovegood
who
piped
Well
that
makes
sense
After
all
Cornelius
Fudge
has
got
his
own
private
army
What
said
Harry
completely
thrown
this
unexpected
piece
information
Yes
got
army
Heliopaths
said
Luna
solemnly
hasn
snapped
Hermione
Yes
has
said
Luna
What
are
Heliopaths
asked
Neville
looking
blank
They
spirits
fire
said
Luna
her
protuberant
eyes
widening
that
she
looked
madder
than
ever
great
tall
flaming
creatures
that
gallop
across
the
ground
burning
everything
front
They
don
exist
Neville
said
Hermione
tartly
yes
they
said
Luna
angrily
sorry
but
where
the
proof
that
snapped
Hermione
There
are
plenty
eye
witness
accounts
Just
because
you
narrow
minded
you
need
have
everything
shoved
under
your
nose
before
you
Hem
hem
said
Ginny
such
good
imitation
Professor
Umbridge
that
several
people
looked
around
alarm
and
then
laughed
Weren
trying
decide
how
often
going
meet
and
have
defence
lessons
Yes
said
Hermione
once
yes
were
you
right
Ginny
Well
once
week
sounds
cool
said
Lee
Jordan
long
began
Angelina
Yes
yes
know
about
the
Quidditch
said
Hermione
tense
voice
Well
the
other
thing
decide
where
going
meet
This
was
rather
more
difficult
the
whole
group
fell
silent
Library
suggested
Katie
Bell
after
few
moments
can
see
Madam
Pince
being
too
chuffed
with
doing
jinxes
the
library
said
Harry
Maybe
unused
classroom
said
Dean
Yeah
said
Ron
McGonagall
might
let
have
hers
she
did
when
Harry
was
practising
for
the
Triwizard
But
Harry
was
pretty
certain
that
McGonagall
would
not
accommodating
this
time
For
all
that
Hermione
had
said
about
study
and
homework
groups
being
allowed
had
the
distinct
feeling
that
this
one
might
considered
lot
more
rebellious
Right
well
try
find
somewhere
said
Hermione
send
message
round
everybody
when
got
time
and
place
for
the
first
meeting
She
rummaged
her
bag
and
produced
parchment
and
quill
then
hesitated
rather
though
she
was
steeling
herself
say
something
think
everybody
should
write
their
name
down
just
know
who
was
here
But
also
think
she
took
deep
breath
that
all
ought
agree
not
shout
about
what
doing
you
sign
you
agreeing
not
tell
Umbridge
anybody
else
what
Fred
reached
out
for
the
parchment
and
cheerfully
wrote
his
signature
but
Harry
noticed
once
that
several
people
looked
less
than
happy
the
prospect
putting
their
names
the
list
said
Zacharias
slowly
not
taking
the
parchment
that
George
was
trying
pass
him
well
sure
Ernie
will
tell
when
the
meeting
But
Ernie
was
looking
rather
hesitant
about
signing
too
Hermione
raised
her
eyebrows
him
well
are
prefects
Ernie
burst
out
And
this
list
was
found
well
mean
say
you
said
yourself
Umbridge
finds
out
You
just
said
this
group
was
the
most
important
thing
you
this
year
Harry
reminded
him
yes
said
Ernie
yes
believe
that
just
Ernie
you
really
think
leave
that
list
lying
around
said
Hermione
testily
course
not
said
Ernie
looking
slightly
less
anxious
yes
course
sign
Nobody
raised
objections
after
Ernie
though
Harry
saw
Cho
friend
give
her
rather
reproachful
look
before
adding
her
own
name
When
the
last
person
Zacharias
had
signed
Hermione
took
the
parchment
back
and
slipped
carefully
into
her
bag
There
was
odd
feeling
the
group
now
was
though
they
had
just
signed
some
kind
contract
Well
time
ticking
said
Fred
briskly
getting
his
feet
George
Lee
and
have
got
items
sensitive
nature
purchase
seeing
you
all
later
twos
and
threes
the
rest
the
group
took
their
leave
too
Cho
made
rather
business
fastening
the
catch
her
bag
before
leaving
her
long
dark
curtain
hair
swinging
forwards
hide
her
face
but
her
friend
stood
beside
her
arms
folded
clicking
her
tongue
that
Cho
had
little
choice
but
leave
with
her
her
friend
ushered
her
through
the
door
Cho
looked
back
and
waved
Harry
Well
think
that
went
quite
well
said
Hermione
happily
she
Harry
and
Ron
walked
out
the
Hog
Head
into
the
bright
sunlight
few
moments
later
Harry
and
Ron
were
clutching
their
bottles
Butterbeer
That
Zacharias
bloke
wart
said
Ron
who
was
glowering
after
the
figure
Smith
just
discernible
the
distance
don
like
him
much
either
admitted
Hermione
but
overheard
talking
Ernie
and
Hannah
the
Hufflepuff
table
and
seemed
really
interested
coming
what
could
say
But
the
more
people
the
better
really
mean
Michael
Corner
and
his
friends
wouldn
have
come
ifhe
hadn
been
going
out
with
Ginny
Ron
who
had
been
draining
the
last
few
drops
from
his
Butterbeer
bottle
gagged
and
sprayed
Butterbeer
down
his
front
WHAT
spluttered
Ron
outraged
his
ears
now
resembling
curls
raw
beef
She
going
out
with
sister
going
what
you
mean
Michael
Corner
Well
that
why
and
his
friends
came
think
well
they
obviously
interested
learning
defence
but
Ginny
hadn
told
Michael
what
was
going
When
did
this
when
did
she
They
met
the
Yule
Ball
and
got
together
the
end
last
year
said
Hermione
composedly
They
had
turned
into
the
High
Street
and
she
paused
outside
Scrivenshaft
Quill
Shop
where
there
was
handsome
display
pheasant
feather
quills
the
window
Hmm
could
with
new
quill
She
turned
into
the
shop
Harry
and
Ron
followed
her
Which
one
was
Michael
Corner
Ron
demanded
furiously
The
dark
one
said
Hermione
didn
like
him
said
Ron
once
Big
surprise
said
Hermione
under
her
breath
But
said
Ron
following
Hermione
along
row
quills
copper
pots
thought
Ginny
fancied
Harry
Hermione
looked
him
rather
pityingly
and
shook
her
head
Ginnyused
fancy
Harry
but
she
gave
him
months
ago
Not
that
she
doesn
tlike
you
course
she
added
kindly
Harry
while
she
examined
long
black
and
gold
quill
Harry
whose
head
was
still
full
Cho
parting
wave
did
not
find
this
subject
quite
interesting
Ron
who
was
positively
quivering
with
indignation
but
did
bring
something
home
him
that
until
now
had
not
really
registered
that
why
she
talks
now
asked
Hermione
She
never
used
talk
front
Exactly
said
Hermione
Yes
think
have
this
one
She
went
the
counter
and
handed
over
fifteen
Sickles
and
two
Knuts
with
Ron
still
breathing
down
her
neck
Ron
she
said
severely
she
turned
and
trod
his
feet
this
exactly
why
Ginny
hasn
told
you
she
seeing
Michael
she
knew
you
take
badly
don
tharp
about
for
heaven
sake
What
you
mean
Who
taking
anything
badly
not
going
harp
about
anything
Ron
continued
chunter
under
his
breath
all
the
way
down
the
street
Hermione
rolled
her
eyes
Harry
and
then
said
undertone
while
Ron
was
still
muttering
imprecations
about
Michael
Corner
And
talking
about
Michael
and
Ginny
what
about
Cho
and
you
What
you
mean
said
Harry
quickly
was
though
boiling
water
was
rising
rapidly
inside
him
burning
sensation
that
was
causing
his
face
smart
the
cold
had
been
that
obvious
Well
said
Hermione
smiling
slightly
she
just
couldn
keep
her
eyes
off
you
could
she
Harry
had
never
before
appreciated
just
how
beautiful
the
village
Hogsmeade
was
EDUCATIONAL

Harry
felt
happier
for
the
rest
the
weekend
than
had
done
all
term
and
Ron
spent
much
Sunday
catching
with
all
their
homework
again
and
although
this
could
hardly
called
fun
the
last
burst
autumn
sunshine
persisted
rather
than
sitting
hunched
over
tables
the
common
room
they
took
their
work
outside
and
lounged
the
shade
large
beech
tree
the
edge
the
lake
Hermione
who
course
was
date
with
all
her
work
brought
more
wool
outside
with
her
and
bewitched
her
knitting
needles
that
they
flashed
and
clicked
midair
beside
her
producing
more
hats
and
scarves
Knowing
they
were
doing
something
resist
Umbridge
and
the
Ministry
and
that
was
key
part
the
rebellion
gave
Harry
feeling
immense
satisfaction
kept
reliving
Saturday
meeting
his
mind
all
those
people
coming
him
learn
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
and
the
looks
their
faces
they
had
heard
some
the
things
had
done
and
Cho
praising
his
performance
the
Triwizard
Tournament
knowing
all
those
people
did
not
think
him
lying
weirdo
but
someone
admired
buoyed
him
much
that
was
still
cheerful
Monday
morning
despite
the
imminent
prospect
all
his
least
favourite
classes
and
Ron
headed
downstairs
from
their
dormitory
discussing
Angelina
idea
that
they
were

new

called
the

Grip

during

and
not
until
they
were
halfway
across

did
they
notice
the

the

had
already
attracted
the

Harry
and

read
the

over
the
heads
some
anxious
looking
second
years
Does
this
mean
they
going
shut
down
the
Gobstones
Club
one
them
asked
his

reckon
you
with

Ron
said
darkly
making
the
second
year
jump
don
think
going
lucky
though
you
asked
Harry
the
second
years
hurried
away
Harry
was
reading
the
notice
through
again
The
happiness
that
had
filled
him
since
Saturday
was
gone
His
insides
were
pulsing
with
rage
This
isn
coincidence
said
his
hands
forming
fists
She
knows
She
can
said
Ron
once
There
were
people
listening
that
pub
And
let
face
don
know
how
many
the
people
who
turned
can
trust
any
them
could
have
run
off
and
told
Umbridge
And
had
thought
they
believed
him
thought
they
even
admired
him
Zacharias
Smith
said
Ron
once
punching
fist
into
his
hand
thought
that
Michael
Corner
had
really
shifty
look
too
wonder
Hermione
seen
this
yet
Harry
said
looking
round
the
door
the
girls
dormitories
Let
and
tell
her
said
Ron
bounded
forwards
pulled
open
the
door
and
set
off
the
spiral
staircase
was
the
sixth
stair
when
there
was
loud
wailing
klaxon
like
sound
and
the
steps
melted
together
make
long
smooth
stone
slide
like
helter
skelter
There
was
brief
moment
when
Ron
tried
keep
running
arms
working
madly
like
windmills
then
toppled
over
backwards
and
shot
down
the
newly
created
slide
coming
rest
his
back
Harry
feet
don
think
allowed
the
girls
dormitories
said
Harry
pulling
Ron
his
feet
and
trying
not
laugh
Two
fourth
year
girls
came
zooming
gleefully
down
the
stone
slide
Oooh
who
tried
get
upstairs
they
giggled
happily
leaping
their
feet
and
ogling
Harry
and
Ron
said
Ron
who
was
still
rather
dishevelled
didn
realise
that
would
happen
not
fair
added
Harry
the
girls
headed
off
for
the
portrait
hole
still
giggling
madly
Hermione
allowed
our
dormitory
how
come
not
allowed
Well
old
fashioned
rule
said
Hermione
who
had
just
slid
neatly
rug
front
them
and
was
now
getting
her
feet
but
says
inHogwarts
History
that
the
founders
thought
boys
were
less
trustworthy
than
girls
Anyway
why
were
you
trying
get
there
see
you
look
this
said
Ron
dragging
her
over
the
noticeboard
Hermione
eyes
slid
rapidly
down
the
notice
Her
expression
became
stony
Someone
must
have
blabbed
her
Ron
said
angrily
They
can
have
done
said
Hermione
low
voice
You
naive
said
Ron
you
think
just
because
you
all
honourable
and
trustworthy
they
can
have
done
because
put
jinx
that
piece
parchment
all
signed
said
Hermione
grimly
Believe
anyone
run
off
and
told
Umbridge
know
exactly
who
they
are
and
they
will
really
regret
What
happen
them
said
Ron
eagerly
Well
put
this
way
said
Hermione
make
Eloise
Midgeon

look
like

cute
freckles
Come
let
get
down
breakfast
and
see
what
the
others
think
wonder
whether
this
has
been
put
all
the
houses
was
immediately
apparent
entering
the
Great
Hall
that
Umbridge
sign
had
not
only
appeared
Gryffindor
Tower
There
was
peculiar
intensity
about
the
chatter
and
extra
measure
movement
the
Hall
people
scurried
and
down
their
tables
conferring
what
they
had
read
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
barely
taken
their
seats
when
Neville
Dean
Fred
George
and
Ginny
descended
upon
them
Did
you
see
you
reckon
she
knows
What
are
going
They
were
all
looking
Harry
glanced
around
make
sure
there
were
teachers
near
them
going
anyway
course
said
quietly
Knew
you
say
that
said
George
beaming
and
thumping
Harry
the
arm
The
prefects
well
said
Fred
looking
quizzically
Ron
and
Hermione
course
said
Hermione
coolly
Here
come
Ernie
and
Hannah
Abbott
said
Ron
looking
over
his
shoulder
And
those
Ravenclaw
blokes
and
Smith
and
one
looks
very
spotty
Hermione
looked
alarmed
Never
mind
spots
the
idiots
can
come
over
here
now
look
really
suspicious
sit
down
she
mouthed
Ernie
and
Hannah
gesturing
frantically
them
rejoin
the
Hufflepuff
table
Later
talk
you
later
tell
Michael
said
Ginny
impatiently
swinging
herself
off
her
bench
the
fool
honestly
She
hurried
off
towards
the
Ravenclaw
table
Harry
watched
her
Cho
was
sitting
not
far
away
talking
the
curly
haired
friend
she
had
brought
along
the
Hog
Head
Would
Umbridge
notice
scare
her
off
meeting
them
again
But
the
full
repercussions
the
sign
were
not
felt
until
they
were
leaving
the
Great
Hall
for
History
Magic
Harry
Ron
was
Angelina
and
she
was
hurrying
towards
them
looking
perfectly
desperate
said
Harry
quietly
when
she
was
near
enough
hear
him
still
going
You
realise
she
including
Quidditch
this
Angelina
said
over
him
have
and
ask
permission
form
the
Gryffindor
team
What
said
Harry
way
said
Ron
appalled
You
read
the
sign
mentions
teams
too
listen
Harry
saying
this
for
the
last
time
please
please
don
lose
your
temper
with
Umbridge
again
she
might
not
let
play
any
more
said
Harry
for
Angelina
looked
though
she
was
the
verge
tears
Don
worry
behave
myself
Bet
Umbridge
History
Magic
said
Ron
grimly
they
set
off
for
Binns
lesson
She
hasn
inspected
Binns
yet
bet
you
anything
she
there
But
was
wrong
the
only
teacher
present
when
they
entered
was
Professor
Binns
floating
inch
above
his
chair
usual
and
preparing
continue
his
monotonous
drone
giant
wars
Harry
did
not
even
attempt
follow
what
was
saying
today
doodled
idly
his
parchment
ignoring
Hermione
frequent
glares
and
nudges
until
particularly
painful
poke
the
ribs
made
him
look
angrily
What
She
pointed
the
window
Harry
looked
round
Hedwig
was
perched
the
narrow
window
ledge
gazing
through
the
thick
glass
him
letter
tied
her
leg
Harry
could
not
understand
they
had
just
had
breakfast
why
earth
hadn
she
delivered
the
letter
then
usual
Many
his
classmates
were
pointing
out
Hedwig
each
other
too
always
loved
that
owl
she
beautiful
Harry
heard
Lavender
sigh
Parvati
glanced
round
Professor
Binns
who
continued
read
his
notes
serenely
unaware
that
the
class
attention
was
even
less
focused
upon
him
than
usual
Harry
slipped
quietly
off
his
chair
crouched
down
and
hurried
along
the
row
the
window
where
slid
the
catch
and
opened
very
slowly
had
expected
Hedwig
hold
out
her
leg
that
could
remove
the
letter
and
then
fly
off
the
Owlery
but
the
moment
the
window
was
open
wide
enough
she
hopped
inside
hooting
dolefully
closed
the
window
with
anxious
glance
Professor
Binns
crouched
low
again
and
sped
back
his
seat
with
Hedwig
his
shoulder
regained
his
seat
transferred
Hedwig
his
lap
and
made
remove
the
letter
tied
her
leg
Only
then
did
realise
that
Hedwig
feathers
were
oddly
ruffled
some
were
bent
the
wrong
way
and
she
was
holding
one
her
wings
odd
angle
She
hurt
Harry
whispered
bending
his
head
low
over
her
Hermione
and
Ron
leaned
closer
Hermione
even
put
down
her
quill
Look
there
something
wrong
with
her
wing
Hedwig
was
quivering
when
Harry
made
touch
the
wing
she
gave
little
jump
all
her
feathers
end
though
she
was
inflating
herself
and
gazed
him
reproachfully
Professor
Binns
said
Harry
loudly
and
everyone
the
class
turned
look
him
not
feeling
well
Professor
Binns
raised
his
eyes
from
his
notes
looking
amazed
always
find
the
room
front
him
full
people
Not
feeling
well
repeated
hazily
Not
all
well
said
Harry
firmly
getting
his
feet
with
Hedwig
concealed
behind
his
back
think
need
the
hospital
wing
Yes
said
Professor
Binns
clearly
very
much
wrong
footed
Yes
yes
hospital
wing
well
off
you
then
Perkins
Once
outside
the
room
Harry
returned
Hedwig
his
shoulder
and
hurried
off
the
corridor
pausing
think
only
when
was
out
sight
Binns
door
His
first
choice
somebody
cure
Hedwig
would
have
been
Hagrid
course
but
had
idea
where
Hagrid
was
his
only
remaining
option
was
find
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
and
hope
she
would
help
peered
out
window
the
blustery
overcast
grounds
There
was
sign
her
anywhere
near
Hagrid
cabin
she
was
not
teaching
she
was
probably
the
staff
room
set
off
downstairs
Hedwig
hooting
feebly
she
swayed
his
shoulder
Two
stone
gargoyles
flanked
the
staff
room
door
Harry
approached
one
them
croaked
You
should
class
Sonny
Jim
This
urgent
said
Harry
curtly
Ooooh
urgent
said
the
other
gargoyle
high
pitched
voice
Well
that
put
our
place
hasn
Harry
knocked
heard
footsteps
then
the
door
opened
and
found
himself
face
face
with
Professor
McGonagall
You
haven
been
given
another
detention
she
said
once
her
square
spectacles
flashing
alarmingly
Professor
said
Harry
hastily
Well
then
why
are
you
out
class
surgent
apparently
said
the
second
gargoyle
snidery
looking
for
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
Harry
explained
owl
she
injured
Injured
owl
did
you
say
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
appeared
Professor
McGonagall
shoulder
smoking
pipe
and
holding
copy
theDaily
Prophet
Yes
said
Harry
lifting
Hedwig
carefully
off
his
shoulder
she
turned
after
the
other
post
owls
and
her
wing
all
funny
look
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
stuck
her
pipe
firmly
between
her
teeth
and
took
Hedwig
from
Harry
while
Professor
McGonagall
watched
Hmm
said
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
her
pipe
waggling
slightly
she
talked
Looks
like
something
attacked
her
Can
think
what
would
have
done
though
Thestrals
will
sometimes
for
birds
course
but
Hagrid
got
the
Hogwarts
Thestrals
well
trained
not
touch
owls
Harry
neither
knew
nor
cared
what
Thestrals
were
just
wanted
know
that
Hedwig
was
going
all
right
Professor
McGonagall
however
looked
sharply
Harry
and
said
you
know
how
far
this
owl
travelled
Potter
said
Harry
From
London
think
met
her
eyes
briefly
and
knew
the
way
her
eyebrows
had
joined
the
middle
that
she
understood
London
mean
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
pulled
monocle
out
the
inside
her
robes
and
screwed
into
her
eye
examine
Hedwig
wing
closely
should
able
sort
this
out
you
leave
her
with
Potter
she
said
she
shouldn
flying
long
distances
for
few
days
any
case
right
thanks
said
Harry
just
the
bell
rang
for
break
problem
said
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
gruffly
turning
back
into
the
staff
room
Just
moment
Wilhelmina
said
Professor
McGonagall
Potter
letter
yeah
said
Harry
who
had
momentarily
forgotten
the
scroll
tied
Hedwig
leg
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
handed
over
and
then
disappeared
into
the
staff
room
carrying
Hedwig
who
was
staring
Harry
though
unable
believe
would
give
her
away
like
this
Feeling
slightly
guilty
turned
but
Professor
McGonagall
called
him
back
Potter
Yes
Professor
She
glanced
and
down
the
corridor
there
were
students
coming
from
both
directions
Bear
mind
she
said
quickly
and
quietly
her
eyes
the
scroll
his
hand
that
channels
communication
and
out
Hogwarts
may
being
watched
won
you
said
Harry
but
the
flood
students
rolling
along
the
corridor
was
almost
upon
him
Professor
McGonagall
gave
him
curt
nod
and
retreated
into
the
staff
room
leaving
Harry
swept
out
into
the
courtyard
with
the
crowd
spotted
Ron
and
Hermione
already
standing
sheltered
corner
their
cloak
collars
turned
against
the
wind
Harry
slit
open
the
scroll
hurried
towards
them
and
found
five
words
Sirius
handwriting
Today
same
time
same
place
Hedwig
asked
Hermione
anxiously
the
moment
was
within
earshot
Where
did
you
take
her
asked
Ron
Grubbly
Plank
said
Harry
And
met
McGonagall
listen
And
told
them
what
Professor
McGonagall
had
said
his
surprise
neither
the
others
looked
shocked
the
contrary
they
exchanged
significant
looks
What
said
Harry
looking
from
Ron
Hermione
and
back
again
Well
was
just
saying
Ron
what
someone
had
tried
intercept
Hedwig
mean
she
never
been
hurt
flight
before
has
she
Who
the
letter
from
anyway
asked
Ron
taking
the
note
from
Harry
Snuffles
said
Harry
quietly
Same
time
same
place
Does
mean
the
fire
the
common
room
Obviously
said
Hermione
also
reading
the
note
She
looked
uneasy
just
hope
nobody
else
has
read
this
But
was
still
sealed
and
everything
said
Harry
trying
convince
himself
much
her
And
nobody
would
understand
what
meant
they
didn
know
where
spoken
him
before
would
they
don
know
said
Hermione
anxiously
hitching
her
bag
back
over
her
shoulder
the
bell
rang
again
wouldn
exactly
difficult
seal
the
scroll
magic
and
anyone
watching
the
Floo
Network
but
don
really
see
how
can
warn
him
not
come
withoutthat
being
intercepted
too
They
trudged
down
the
stone
steps
the
dungeons
for
Potions
all
three
them
lost
thought
but
they
reached
the
bottom
the
steps
they
were
recalled
themselves
the
voice
Draco
Malfoy
who
was
standing
just
outside
Snape
classroom
door
waving
around
official
looking
piece
parchment
and
talking
much
louder
than
was
necessary
that
they
could
hear
every
word
Yeah
Umbridge
gave
the
Slytherin
Quidditch
team
permission
continue
playing
straightaway
went
ask
her
first
thing
this
morning
Well
was
pretty
much
automatic
mean
she
knows
father
really
well
always
popping
and
out
the
Ministry
interesting
see
whether
Gryffindor
are
allowed
keep
playing
won
Don
rise
Hermione
whispered
imploringly
Harry
and
Ron
who
were
both
watching
Malfoy
faces
set
and
fists
clenched
what
wants
mean
said
Malfoy
raising
his
voice
little
more
his
grey
eyes
glittering
malevolently
Harry
and
Ron
direction
question
influence
with
the
Ministry
don
think
they
got
much
chance
from
what
father
says
they
been
looking
for
excuse
sack
Arthur
Weasley
for
years
and
for
Potter
father
says
matter
time
before
the
Ministry
has
him
carted
off
Mungo
apparently
they
got
special
ward
for
people
whose
brains
have
been
addled
magic
Malfoy
made
grotesque
face
his
mouth
sagging
open
and
his
eyes
rolling
Crabbe
and
Goyle
gave
their
usual
grunts
laughter
Pansy
Parkinson
shrieked
with
glee
Something
collided
hard
with
Harry
shoulder
knocking
him
sideways
split
second
later
realised
that
Neville
had
just
charged
past
him
heading
straight
for
Malfoy
Neville
Harry
leapt
forward
and
seized
the
back
Neville
robes
Neville
struggled
frantically
his
fists
flailing
trying
desperately
get
Malfoy
who
looked
for
moment
extremely
shocked
Help
Harry
flung
Ron
managing
get
arm
around
Neville
neck
and
dragging
him
backwards
away
from
the
Slytherins
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
flexing
their
arms
they
stepped
front
Malfoy
ready
for
the
fight
Ron
seized
Neville
arms
and
together
and
Harry
succeeded
dragging
Neville
back
into
the
Gryffindor
line
Neville
face
was
scarlet
the
pressure
Harry
was
exerting
his
throat
rendered
him
quite
incomprehensible
but
odd
words
spluttered
from
his
mouth
Not
funny
don
Mungo
show
him
The
dungeon
door
opened
Snape
appeared
there
His
black
eyes
swept
the
Gryffindor
line
the
point
where
Harry
and
Ron
were
wrestling
with
Neville
Fighting
Potter
Weasley
Longbottom
Snape
said
his
cold
sneering
voice
Ten
points
from
Gryffindor
Release
Longbottom
Potter
will
detention
Inside
all
you
Harry
let
Neville
who
stood
panting
and
glaring
him
had
stop
you
Harry
gasped
picking
his
bag
Crabbe
and
Goyle
would
torn
you
apart
Neville
said
nothing
merely
snatched
his
own
bag
and
stalked
off
into
the
dungeon
What
the
name
Merlin
said
Ron
slowly
they
followed
Neville
wasthat
about
Harry
did
not
answer
knew
exactly
why
the
subject
people
who
were
Mungo
because
magical
damage
their
brains
was
highly
distressing
Neville
but
had
sworn
Dumbledore
that
would
not
tell
anyone
Neville
secret
Even
Neville
did
not
know
Harry
knew
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
took
their
usual
seats
the
back
the
class
pulled
out
parchment
quills
and
their
copies
ofOne
Thousand
Magical
Herbs
and
Fungi
The
class
around
them
was
whispering
about
what
Neville
had
just
done
but
when
Snape
closed
the
dungeon
door
with
echoing
bang
everybody
immediately
fell
silent
You
will
notice
said
Snape
his
low
sneering
voice
that
have
guest
with
today
gestured
towards
the
dim
corner
the
dungeon
and
Harry
saw
Professor
Umbridge
sitting
there
clipboard
her
knee
glanced
sideways
Ron
and
Hermione
his
eyebrows
raised
Snape
and
Umbridge
the
two
teachers
hated
most
was
hard
decide
which
one
wanted
triumph
over
the
other
are
continuing
with
our
Strengthening
Solution
today
You
will
find
your
mixtures
you
left
them
last
lesson
correctly
made
they
should
have
matured
well
over
the
weekend
instructions
waved
his
wand
again
the
board
Carry
Professor
Umbridge
spent
the
first
half
hour
the
lesson
making
notes
her
corner
Harry
was
very
interested
hearing
her
question
Snape
interested
that
was
becoming
careless
with
his
potion
again
Salamander
blood
Harry
Hermione
moaned
grabbing
his
wrist
prevent
him
adding
the
wrong
ingredient
for
the
third
time
not
pomegranate
juice
Right
said
Harry
vaguely
putting
down
the
bottle
and
continuing
watch
the
corner
Umbridge
had
just
got
her
feet
said
softly
she
strode
between
two
lines
desks
towards
Snape
who
was
bending
over
Dean
Thomas
cauldron
Well
the
class
seem
fairly
advanced
for
their
level
she
said
briskly
Snape
back
Though
would
question
whether
advisable
teach
them
potion
like
the
Strengthening
Solution
think
the
Ministry
would
prefer
that
was
removed
from
the
syllabus
Snape
straightened
slowly
and
turned
look
her
Now
how
long
have
you
been
teaching
Hogwarts
she
asked
her
quill
poised
over
her
clipboard
Fourteen
years
Snape
replied
His
expression
was
unfathomable
Harry
watching
him
closely
added
few
drops
his
potion
hissed
menacingly
and
turned
from
turquoise
orange
You
applied
first
for
the
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
post
believe
Professor
Umbridge
asked
Snape
Yes
said
Snape
quietly
But
you
were
unsuccessful
Snape
lip
curled
Obviously
Professor
Umbridge
scribbled
her
clipboard
And
you
have
applied
regularly
for
the
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
post
since
you
first
joined
the
school
believe
Yes
said
Snape
quietly
barely
moving
his
lips
looked
very
angry
you
have
any
idea
why
Dumbledore
has
consistently
refused
appoint
you
asked
Umbridge
suggest
you
ask
him
said
Snape
jerkily
shall
said
Professor
Umbridge
with
sweet
smile
suppose
this
relevant
Snape
asked
his
black
eyes
narrowed
yes
said
Professor
Umbridge
yes
the
Ministry
wants
thorough
understanding
teachers
backgrounds
She
turned
away
walked
over
Pansy
Parkinson
and
began
questioning
her
about
the
lessons
Snape
looked
round
Harry
and
their
eyes
met
for
second
Harry
hastily
dropped
his
gaze
his
potion
which
was
now
congealing
foully
and
giving
off
strong
smell
burned
rubber
marks
again
then
Potter
said
Snape
maliciously
emptying
Harry
cauldron
with
wave
his
wand
You
will
write
essay
the
correct
composition
this
potion
indicating
how
and
why
you
went
wrong
handed
next
lesson
you
understand
Yes
said
Harry
furiously
Snape
had
already
given
them
homework
and
had
Quidditch
practice
this
evening
this
would
mean
another
couple
sleepless
nights
did
not
seem
possible
that
had
awoken
that
morning
feeling
very
happy
All
felt
now
was
fervent
desire
for
this
day
end
Maybe
skive
off
Divination
said
glumly
they
stood
the
courtyard
after
lunch
the
wind
whipping
the
hems
robes
and
brims
hats
pretend
ill
and
Snape
essay
instead
then
won
have
stay
half
the
night
You
can
skive
off
Divination
said
Hermione
severely
Hark
who
talking
you
walked
out
Divination
you
hate
Trelawney
said
Ron
indignantly
don
thate
her
said
Hermione
loftily
just
think
she
absolutely
appalling
teacher
and
real
old
fraud
But
Harry
already
missed
History
Magic
and
don
think
ought
miss
anything
else
today
There
was
too
much
truth
this
ignore
half
hour
later
Harry
took
his
seat
the
hot
overperfumed
atmosphere
the
Divination
classroom
feeling
angry
everybody
Professor
Trelawney
was
yet
again
handing
out
copies
ofThe
Dream
Oracle
Harry
thought
surely
much
better
employed
doing
Snape
punishment
essay
than
sitting
here
trying
find
meaning
lot
made
dreams
seemed
however
that
was
not
the
only
person
Divination
who
was
temper
Professor
Trelawney
slammed
copy
theOracle
down
the
table
between
Harry
and
Ron
and
swept
away
her
lips
pursed
she
threw
the
next
copy
theOracle
Seamus
and
Dean
narrowly
avoiding
Seamus
head
and
thrust
the
final
one
into
Neville
chest
with
such
force
that
slipped
off
his
pouffe
Well
carry
said
Professor
Trelawney
loudly
her
voice
high
pitched
and
somewhat
hysterical
you
know
what
such
sub
standard
teacher
that
you
have
never
learned
how
open
book
The
class
stared
perplexedly
her
then
each
other
Harry
however
thought
knew
what
was
the
matter
Professor
Trelawney
flounced
back
the
high
backed
teacher
chair
her
magnified
eyes
full
angry
tears
leaned
his
head
closer
Ron
and
muttered
think
she
got
the
results
her
inspection
back
Professor
said
Parvati
Patil
hushed
voice
she
and
Lavender
had
always
rather
admired
Professor
Trelawney
Professor
there
anything
wrong
Wrong
cried
Professor
Trelawney
voice
throbbing
with
emotion
Certainly
not
have
been
insulted
certainly
insinuations
have
been
made
against
unfounded
accusations
levelled
but
there
nothing
wrong
certainly
not
She
took
great
shuddering
breath
and
looked
away
from
Parvati
angry
tears
spilling
from
under
her
glasses
say
nothing
she
choked
sixteen
years
devoted
service
has
passed
apparently
unnoticed
but
shall
not
insulted
shall
not
But
Professor
who
insulting
you
asked
Parvati
timidly
The
Establishment
said
Professor
Trelawney
deep
dramatic
wavering
voice
Yes
those
with
eyes
too
clouded
the
mundane
See
See
Know
Know
course
Seers
have
always
been
feared
always
persecuted
alas
our
fate
She
gulped
dabbed
her
wet
cheeks
with
the
end
her
shawl
then
she
pulled
small
embroidered
handkerchief
from
her
sleeve
and
blew
her
nose
very
hard
with
sound
like
Peeves
blowing
raspberry
Ron
sniggered
Lavender
shot
him
disgusted
look
Professor
said
Parvati
you
mean
something
Professor
Umbridge
not
speak
about
that
woman
cried
Professor
Trelawney
leaping
her
feet
her
beads
rattling
and
her
spectacles
flashing
Kindly
continue
with
your
work
And
she
spent
the
rest
the
lesson
striding
among
them
tears
still
leaking
from
behind
her
glasses
muttering
what
sounded
like
threats
under
her
breath
may
well
choose
leave
the
indignity
probation
shall
see
how
she
dares
You
and
Umbridge
have
got
something
common
Harry
told
Hermione
quietly
when
they
met
again
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
She
obviously
reckons
Trelawney
old
fraud
too
looks
like
she
put
her
probation
Umbridge
entered
the
room
spoke
wearing
her
black
velvet
bow
and
expression
great
smugness
Good
afternoon
class
Good
afternoon
Professor
Umbridge
they
chanted
dully
Wands
away
please
But
there
was
answering
flurry
movement
this
time
nobody
had
bothered
take
out
their
wands
Please
turn
page
thirty
four
ofDefensive
Magical
Theory
and
read
the
third
chapter
entitled
The
Case

Non
Offensive
Responses
Magical
Attack
There
will
need
talk
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
said
together
under
their
breaths
Quidditch
practice
said
Angelina
hollow
tones
when
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
entered
the
common
room
after
dinner
that
night
But
kept
temper
said
Harry
horrified
didn
say
anything
her
Angelina
swear
know
know
said
Angelina
miserably
She
just
said
she
needed
bit
time
consider
Consider
what
said
Ron
angrily
She
given
the
Slytherins
permission
why
not
But
Harry
could
imagine
how
much
Umbridge
was
enjoying
holding
the
threat
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
over
their
heads
and
could
easily
understand
why
she
would
not
want
relinquish
that
weapon
over
them
too
soon
Well
said
Hermione
look
the
bright
side
least
now
you
have
time
Snape
essay
That
bright
side
snapped
Harry
while
Ron
stared
incredulously
Hermione
Quidditch
practice
and
extra
Potions
Harry
slumped
down
into
chair
dragged
his
Potions
essay
reluctantly
from
his
bag
and
set
work
was
very
hard
concentrate
even
though
knew
Sirius
was
not
due
the
fire
until
much
later
could
not
help
glancing
into
the
flames
every
few
minutes
just
case
There
was
also
incredible
amount
noise
the
room
Fred
and
George
appeared
finally
have
perfected
one
type
Skiving
Snackbox
which
they
were
taking
turns
demonstrate
cheering
and
whooping
crowd
First
Fred
would
take
bite
out
the
orange
end
chew
which
would
vomit
spectacularly
into
bucket
they
had
placed
front
them
Then
would
force
down
the
purple
end
the
chew
which
the
vomiting
would
immediately
cease
Lee
Jordan
who
was
assisting
the
demonstration
was
lazily
Vanishing
the
vomit
regular
intervals
with
the
same
Vanishing
Spell
Snape
kept
using
Harry
potions
What
with
the
regular
sounds
retching
cheering
and
the
sound
Fred
and
George
taking
advance
orders
from
the
crowd
Harry
was
finding
exceptionally
difficult
focus
the
correct
method
for
Strengthening
Solution
Hermione
was
not
helping
matters
the
cheers
and
the
sound
vomit
hitting
the
bottom
Fred
and
George
bucket
were
punctuated
her
loud
and
disapproving
sniffs
which
Harry
found
anything
more
distracting
Just
and
stop
them
then
said
irritably
after
crossing
out
the
wrong
weight
powdered
griffin
claw
for
the
fourth
time
can
they
nottechnically
doing
anything
wrong
said
Hermione
through
gritted
teeth
They
quite
within
their
rights
eat
the
foul
things
themselves
and
can
find
rule
that
says
the
other
idiots
aren
entitled
buy
them
not
unless
they
proven
dangerous
some
way
and
doesn
look
though
they
are
She
Harry
and
Ron
watched
George
projectile
vomit
into
the
bucket
gulp
down
the
rest
the
chew
and
straighten
beaming
with
his
arms
wide
protracted
applause
You
know
don
get
why
Fred
and
George
only
got
three
each
said
Harry
watching
Fred
George
and
Lee
collected
gold
from
the
eager
crowd
They
really
know
their
stuff
they
only
know
flashy
stuff
that
real
use

said
Hermione
disparagingly
real
use
said
Ron
strained
voice
Hermione
they
made
about
twenty
six
Galleons
already
was
long
while
before
the
crowd
around
the
Weasley
twins
dispersed
then
Fred
Lee
and
George
sat
counting
their
takings
even
longer
was
well
past
midnight
when
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
finally
had
the
common
room
themselves
long
last
Fred
had
closed
the
doorway
the
boys
dormitories
behind
him
rattling
his
box
Galleons
ostentatiously
that
Hermione
scowled
Harry
who
was
making
very
little
progress
with
his
Potions
essay
decided
give
for
the
night
put
his
books
away
Ron
who
was
dozing
lightly
armchair
gave
muffled
grunt
awoke
and
looked
blearily
into
the
fire
Sirius
said
Harry
whipped
round
Sirius
untidy
dark
head
was
sitting
the
fire
again
said
grinning
chorused
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
all
three
kneeling
down
the
hearthrug
Crookshanks
purred
loudly
and
approached
the
fire
trying
despite
the
heat
put
his
face
close
Sirius
How
things
said
Sirius
Not
that
good
said
Harry
Hermione
pulled
Crookshanks
back
stop
him
singeing
his
whiskers
The
Ministry
forced
through
another
decree
which
means
not
allowed

said
Sirius
There
was
short
pause
How
did
you
know
about

Harry
demanded
You
want

your
meeting
places
more
carefully
said
Sirius
grinning
still
more
broadly
The
Hog
Head
ask
you
Well

better
than
the
Three
Broomsticks
said
Hermione
defensively
That
always
packed
with
people
Which
means

been
harder

said
Sirius
You
got
lot

Hermione
Who
overheard
Harry
demanded
Mundungus

said
Sirius
and
when
they
all
looked
puzzled
laughed
was
the
witch
under
the
veil
That
was
Mundungus
Harry
said
stunned
What
was
doing
the
Hog
Head
What
you
think
was
doing
said
Sirius
impatiently
Keeping
eye
you
course
still
being
followed
asked
Harry
angrily
Yeah

said
Sirius
and
just
well

first

But
looked
neither
angry
nor
worried
the
contrary
was
looking
Harry
with
distinct
pride
Why
was
Dung
hiding
from
asked
Ron
sounding
disappointed
liked
seen
him

banned

Sirius

says

She
says
there

time

how

yourself
later
and
that
you
are
too
young
worrying
about
that
right
now
She
also
Sirius
eyes
turned
the
other
two
advises
Harry
and
Hermione
not
proceed
with
the
group
though
she
accepts
that
she
has
authority
over
either
them
and
simply
begs
them

that
she
has
their
best
interests
heart
She
would
have
written
all
this

but
the

Sirius
fallen
the
messenger
and
make
sure
you
tell
her
passed
all
because
don
think
she
trusts
There
was
another
pause
which
Crookshanks
mewing
attempted
paw
Sirius
head
and
Ron
fiddled
with
hole
the
hearthrug
you
want
say
not
going
take
part
the
Defence
group
muttered
finally
Certainly
not
said
Sirius
looking
surprised
think
excellent
idea
You
said
Harry
his
heart
lifting
course
said
Sirius
you
think
your
father
and
would
lain
down
and
taken
orders
from
old
hag
like
Umbridge
But
last
term
all
you
did
was
tell
careful
and
not
take
risks
Last
year
all
the
evidence
was
that
someone
inside
Hogwarts
was
trying
kill
you
Harry
said
Sirius
impatiently
This
year
know
there
someone
outside
Hogwarts
who
like
kill
all
think
learning
defend
yourselves
properly
very
good
idea
And
get
expelled
Hermione
asked
quizzical
look
her
face
Hermione
this
whole
thing
was
your
idea
said
Harry
staring
her
know
was
just
wondered
what
Sirius
thought
she
said
shrugging
Well
better
expelled
and
able
defend
yourselves
than
sitting
safely
school
without
clue
said
Sirius
Hear
hear
said
Harry
and
Ron
enthusiastically
said
Sirius
how
are
you
organising
this
group
Where
are
you
meeting
Well
that
bit
problem
now
said
Harry
Dunno
where
going
able
How
about
the
Shrieking
Shack
suggested
Sirius
Hey
that
idea
said
Ron
excitedly
but
Hermione
made
sceptical
noise
and
all
three
them
looked
her
Sirius
head
turning
the
flames
Well
Sirius
just
that
there
were
only
four
you
meeting
the
Shrieking
Shack
when
you
were
school
said
Hermione
and
all
you
could
transform
into
animals
and
suppose
you
could
all
have
squeezed
under
single
Invisibility
Cloak
you
wanted
But
there
are
twenty
eight
and
none
Animagus
wouldn
need
much
Invisibility
Cloak
Invisibility
Marquee
Fair
point
said
Sirius
looking
slightly
crestfallen
Well
sure
you
come
with
somewhere
There
used
pretty
roomy
secret
passageway
behind
that
big
mirror
the
fourth
floor
you
might
have
enough
space
practise
jinxes
there
Fred
and
George
told
blocked
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
Caved
something
said
Sirius
frowning
Well
have
think
and
get
back
broke
off
His
face
was
suddenly
tense
alarmed
turned
sideways
apparently
looking
into
the
solid
brick
wall
the
fireplace
Sirius
said
Harry
anxiously
But
had
vanished
Harry
gaped
the
flames
for
moment
then
turned
look
Ron
and
Hermione
Why
did
Hermione
gave
horrified
gasp
and
leapt
her
feet
still
staring
the
fire
hand
had
appeared
amongst
the
flames
groping
though
catch
hold
something
stubby
short
fingered
hand
covered
ugly
old
fashioned
rings
The
three
them
ran
for
the
door
the
boys
dormitory
Harry
looked
back
Umbridge
hand
was
still
making
snatching
movements
amongst
the
flames
though
she
knew
exactly
where
Sirius
hair
had
been
moments
before
and
was
determined
seize
DUMBLEDORE
ARMY
Umbridge
has
been
reading
your
mail
Harry
There
other
explanation
You
think
Umbridge
attacked
Hedwig
said
outraged
almost
certain
said
Hermione
grimly
Watch
your
frog
escaping
Harry
pointed
his
wand
the
bullfrog
that
had
been
hopping
hopefully
towards
the
other
side
the
table
Accio
and
zoomed
gloomily
back
into
his
hand
Charms
was
always
one
the
best
lessons
which
enjoy
private
chat
there
was
generally
much
movement
and
activity
that
the
danger
being
overheard
was
very
slight
Today
with
the
room
full
croaking
bullfrogs
and
cawing
ravens
and
with
heavy
downpour
rain
clattering
and
pounding
against
the
classroom
windows
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
whispered
discussion
about
how
Umbridge
had
nearly
caught
Sirius
went
quite
unnoticed
been
suspecting
this
ever
since
Filch
accused
you
ordering
Dungbombs
because
seemed
such
stupid
lie
Hermione
whispered
mean
once
your
letter
had
been
read
would
have
been
quite
clear
youweren
ordering
them
you
wouldn
have
been
trouble
all
bit
feeble
joke
isn
But
then
thought
what
somebody
just
wanted
excuse
read
your
mail
Well
then
would
perfect
way
for
Umbridge
manage
tip
off
Filch
let
him
the
dirty
work
and
confiscate
the
letter
then
either
find
way
stealing
from
him
else
demand
see
don
think
Filch
would
object
when
ever
stuck
for
student
rights
Harry
you
squashing
your
frog
Harry
looked
down
was
indeed
squeezing
his
bullfrog
tightly
its
eyes
were
popping
replaced
hastily
upon
the
desk
was
very
very
close

last
night
said
Hermione
just
wonder
Umbridge
knows
how
close
was
Silencio
The
bullfrog
which
she
was
practising
her
Silencing
Charm
was
struck
dumb
mid
croak
and
glared
her
reproachfully
she
caught
Snuffles
Harry
finished
the
sentence
for
her
probably
back
Azkaban
this
morning
waved
his
wand
without
really
concentrating
his
bullfrog
swelled
like
green
balloon
and
emitted
high
pitched
whistle
Silencio
said
Hermione
hastily
pointing
her
wand
Harry

which
deflated
silently
before
them
Well

said
Ron

she
nearly
got

Silencio
The
large
and
ugly
raven

him
let

derisive
caw
Silencio
SILENCIO
The
raven
cawed
more
loudly
the
way

said
Hermione
watching
Ron
critically

want

Ravens

harder
than

said
Ron
through
clenched
teeth
Fine

said
Hermione
seizing
Ron
raven
and
replacing
with
her
own
fat
bullfrog
Silencio
The
raven
continued
open
and
close
its
sharp
beak
but
sound
came
out
Very
good
Miss
Granger
said
Professor
Flitwick
squeaky
little
voice
making
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
all
jump
Now
let
see
you
try
Weasley
Wha
right
said
Ron
very
flustered
silencio
jabbed
the
bullfrog
hard
poked
the
eye
the
frog
gave
deafening
croak
and
leapt
off
the
desk
came
surprise
any
them
that
Harry
and
Ron
were
given
additional
practice
the
Silencing
Charm
for
homework
They
were
allowed
remain
inside
over
break
due
the
downpour
outside
They
found
seats
noisy
and
overcrowded
classroom
the
first
floor
which
Peeves
was
floating
dreamily
near
the
chandelier
occasionally
blowing
ink
pellet
the
top
somebody
head
They
had
barely
sat
down
when
Angelina
came
struggling
towards
them
through
the
groups
gossiping
students
got
permission
she
said
form
the
Quidditch
team
Excellent
said
Ron
and
Harry
together
Yeah
said
Angelina
beaming
went
McGonagall
and
Ithink
she
might
have
appealed
Dumbledore
Anyway
Umbridge
had
give
want
you
down
the
pitch
seven
clock
tonight
all
right
because
got
make
time
You
realise
only
three
weeks
away
from
our
first
match
She
squeezed
away
from
them
narrowly
dodged
ink
pellet
from
Peeves
which
hit
nearby
first
year
instead
and
vanished
from
sight
Ron
smile
slipped
slightly
looked
out
the
window
which
was
now
opaque
with
hammering
rain
Hope
this
clears
What
with
you
Hermione
She
too
was
gazing
the
window
but
not
though
she
really
saw
Her
eyes
were
unfocused
and
there
was
frown
her
face
Just
thinking
she
said
still
frowning
the
rain
washed
window
About
Siri
Snuffles
said
Harry
not
exactly
said
Hermione
slowly
More
wondering
suppose
doing
the
right
thing
think
aren
Harry
and
Ron
looked
each
other
Well
that
clears
that
said
Ron
would
been
really
annoying
you
hadn
explained
yourself
properly
Hermione
looked
him
though
she
had
only
just
realised
was
there
was
just
wondering
she
said
her
voice
stronger
now
whether
doing
the
right
thing
starting
this
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
group
What
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
Hermione
was
your
idea
the
first
place
said
Ron
indignantly
know
said
Hermione
twisting
her
fingers
together
But
after
talking
Snuffles
But
all
for
said
Harry
Yes
said
Hermione
staring
the
window
again
Yes
that
what
made
think
maybe
wasn
good
idea
after
all
Peeves
floated
over
them
his
stomach
peashooter
the
ready
automatically
all
three
them
lifted
their
bags
cover
their
heads
until
had
passed
Let
get
this
straight
said
Harry
angrily
they
put
their
bags
back
the
floor
Sirius
agrees
with
you
don
think
should
any
more
Hermione
looked
tense
and
rather
miserable
Now
staring
her
own
hands
she
said
you
honestly
trust
his
judgement
Yes
said
Harry
once
always
given
great
advice
ink
pellet
whizzed
past
them
striking
Katie
Bell
squarely
the
ear
Hermione
watched
Katie
leap
her
feet
and
start
throwing
things
Peeves
was
few
moments
before
Hermione
spoke
again
and
sounded
though
she
was
choosing
her
words
very
carefully
You
don
think
has
become
sort
reckless
since
been
cooped
Grimmauld
Place
You
don
think
kind
living
through
What
you
mean
living
through
Harry
retorted
mean
well
think
love
forming
secret
Defence
societies
right
under
the
nose
someone
from
the
Ministry
think
really
frustrated
how
little
can
where
think
keen
kind
egg
Ron
looked
utterly
perplexed
Sirius
right
said
youdo
sound
just
like
mother
Hermione
bit
her
lip
and
did
not
answer
The
bell
rang
just
Peeves
swooped
down
Katie
and
emptied
entire
ink
bottle
over
her
head
The
weather
did
not
improve
the
day
wore
that
seven
clock
that
evening
when
Harry
and
Ron
went
down
the
Quidditch
pitch
for
practice
they
were
soaked
through
within
minutes
their
feet
slipping
and
sliding
the
sodden
grass
The
sky
was
deep
thundery
grey
and
was
relief
gain
the
warmth
and
light
the
changing
rooms
even
they
knew
the
respite
was
only
temporary
They
found
Fred
and
George
debating
whether
use
one
their
own
Skiving
Snackboxes
get
out
flying
but
bet
she
know
what
done
Fred
said
out
the
corner
his
mouth
only
hadn
offered
sell
her
some
Puking
Pastilles
yesterday
could
try
the
Fever
Fudge
George
muttered
one
seen
that
yet
Does
work
enquired
Ron
hopefully
the
hammering
rain
the
roof
intensified
and
wind
howled
around
the
building
Well
yeah
said
Fred
your
temperature
right
But
you
get
these
massive
pus
filled
boils
too
said
George
and
haven
worked
out
how
get
rid
them
yet
can
see
any
boils
said
Ron
staring
the
twins
well
you
wouldn
said
Fred
darkly
they
not
place
generally
display
the
public
But
they
make
sitting
broom
right
pain
the
All
right
everyone

said
Angelina
loudly
emerging
from
the
Captain
office
know
not
ideal
weather
but
there
chance
playing
Slytherin
conditions
like
this
good
idea
work
out
how
going
cope
with
them
Harry
didn
you
something
your
glasses
stop
the
rain
fogging
them
when
played
Hufflepuff
that
storm
Hermione
did
said
Harry
pulled
out
his
wand
tapped
his
glasses
and
said
Impervius
think
all
ought
try
that
said
Angelina
could
just
keep
the
rain
off
our
faces
would
really
help
visibility
all
together
come
Impervius
Let
They
all
stowed
their
wands
back
the
inside
pockets
their
robes
shouldered
their
brooms
and
followed
Angelina
out
the
changing
rooms
They
squelched
through
the
deepening
mud
the
middle
the
pitch
visibility
was
still
very
poor
even
with
the
Impervius
Charm
light
was
fading
fast
and
curtains
rain
were
sweeping
the
grounds
All
right
whistle
shouted
Angelina
Harry
kicked
off
from
the
ground
spraying
mud
all
directions
and
shot
upwards
the
wind
pulling
him
slightly
off
course
had
idea
how
was
going
see
the
Snitch
this
weather
was
having
enough
difficulty
seeing
the
one
Bludger
with
which
they
were
practising
minute
into
the
practice
almost
unseated
him
and
had
use
the
Sloth
Grip
Roll
avoid
Unfortunately
Angelina
did
not
see
this
fact
she
did
not
appear
able
see
anything
none
them
had
clue
what
the
others
were
doing
The
wind
was
picking
even
distance
Harry
could
hear
the
swishing
pounding
sounds
the
rain
pummelling
the
surface
the
lake
Angelina
kept
them
for
nearly
hour
before
conceding
defeat
She
led
her
sodden
and
disgruntled
team
back
into
the
changing
rooms
insisting
that
the
practice
had
not
been
waste
time
though
without
any
real
conviction
her
voice
Fred
and
George
were
looking
particularly
annoyed
both
were
bandy
legged
and
winced
with
every
movement
Harry
could
hear
them
complaining
low
voices
towelled
his
hair
dry
think
few
mine
have
ruptured
said
Fred
hollow
voice
Mine
haven
said
George
through
clenched
teeth
they
throbbing
like
mad
feel
bigger
anything
OUCH
said
Harry
pressed
the
towel
his
face
his
eyes
screwed
tight
with
pain
The
scar
his
forehead
had
seared
again
more
painfully
than
had
weeks
What
said
several
voices
Harry
emerged
from
behind
his
towel
the
changing
room
was
blurred
because
was
not
wearing
his
glasses
but
could
still
tell
that
everyone
face
was
turned
towards
him
Nothing
muttered
poked
myself
the
eye
that
all
But
gave
Ron
significant
look
and
the
two
them
hung
back
the
rest
the
team
filed
back
outside
muffled
their
cloaks
their
hats
pulled
low
over
their
ears
What
happened
said
Ron
the
moment
Alicia
had
disappeared
through
the
door
Was
your
scar
Harry
nodded
But
looking
scared
Ron
strode
across
the
window
and
stared
out
into
the
rain
can
near
now
can
Harry
muttered
sinking
bench
and
rubbing
his
forehead
probably
miles
away
hurt
because
angry
Harry
had
not
meant
say
that
all
and
heard
the
words
though
stranger
had
spoken
them
yet
knew
once
that
they
were
true
did
not
know
how
knew
but
did
Voldemort
wherever
was
whatever
was
doing
was
towering
temper
Did
you
see
him
said
Ron
looking
horrified
Did
you
get
vision
something
Harry
sat
quite
still
staring
his
feet
allowing
his
mind
and
his
memory
relax
the
aftermath
the
pain
confused
tangle
shapes
howling
rush
voices
wants
something
done
and
not
happening
fast
enough
said
Again
felt
surprised
hear
the
words
coming
out
his
mouth
and
yet
was
quite
certain
they
were
true
But
how
you
know
said
Ron
Harry
shook
his
head
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
pressing
down
upon
them
with
his
palms
Little
stars
erupted
them
felt
Ron
sit
down
the
bench
beside
him
and
knew
Ron
was
staring
him
this
what
was
about
last
time
said
Ron
hushed
voice
When
your
scar
hurt
Umbridge
office
You
Know
Who
was
angry
Harry
shook
his
head
What
then
Harry
was
thinking
himself
back
had
been
looking
into
Umbridge
face
his
scar
had
hurt
and
had
had
that
odd
feeling
his
stomach
strange
leaping
feeling
ahappy
feeling
but
course
had
not
recognised
for
what
was
had
been
feeling
miserable
himself
Last
time
was
because
was
pleased
said
Really
pleased
thought
something
good
was
going
happen
And
the
night
before
came
back
Hogwarts
thought
back
the
moment
when
his
scar
had
hurt
badly
his
and
Ron
bedroom
Grimmauld
Place
was
furious
looked
round
Ron
who
was
gaping
him
You
could
take
over
from
Trelawney
mate
said
awed
voice
not
making
prophecies
said
Harry
you
know
what
you
doing
Ron
said
sounding
both
scared
and
impressed
Harry
you
reading
You
Know
Who
mind
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
more
like
his
mood
suppose
just
getting
flashes
what
mood
Dumbledore
said
something
like
this
was
happening
last
year
said
that
when
Voldemort
was
near
when
was
feeling
hatred
could
tell
Well
now
feeling
when
pleased
too
There
was
pause
The
wind
and
rain
lashed
the
building
You
got
tell
someone
said
Ron
told
Sirius
last
time
Well
tell
him
about
this
time
Can
can
said
Harry
grimly
Umbridge
watching
the
owls
and
the
fires
remember
Well
then
Dumbledore
just
told
you
already
knows
said
Harry
shortly
getting
his
feet
taking
his
cloak
off
his
peg
and
swinging
around
him
There
point
telling
him
again
Ron
did
the
fastening
his
own
cloak
watching
Harry
thoughtfully
Dumbledore
want
know
said
Harry
shrugged
mon
still
got
Silencing
Charms
practise
They
hurried
back
through
the
dark
grounds
sliding
and
stumbling
the
muddy
lawns
not
talking
Harry
was
thinking
hard
What
was
that
Voldemort
wanted
done
that
was
not
happening
quickly
enough
got
other
plans
plans
can
put
into
operation
very
quietly
indeed
stuff
can
only
get
stealth
like
weapon
Something
didn
have
last
time
Harry
had
not
thought
about
those
words
weeks
had
been
too
absorbed
what
was
going
Hogwarts
too
busy
dwelling
the
ongoing
battles
with
Umbridge
the
injustice
all
the
Ministry
interference
but
now
they
came
back
him
and
made
him
wonder
Voldemort
anger
would
make
sense
was
nearer
laying
hands
theweapon
whatever
was
Had
the
Order
thwarted
him
stopped
him
from
seizing
Where
was
kept
Who
had
now
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
said
Ron
voice
and
Harry
came
back
his
senses
just
time
clamber
through
the
portrait
hole
into
the
common
room
appeared
that
Hermione
had
gone
bed
early
leaving
Crookshanks
curled
nearby
chair
and
assortment
knobbly
knitted
elf
hats
lying
table
the
fire
Harry
was
rather
grateful
that
she
was
not
around
because
did
not
much
want
discuss
his
scar
hurting
and
have
her
urge
him
Dumbledore
too
Ron
kept
throwing
him
anxious
glances
but
Harry
pulled
out
his
Charms
books
and
set
work
finishing
his
essay
though
was
only
pretending
concentrate
and
the
time
Ron
said
was
going
bed
too
had
written
hardly
anything
Midnight
came
and
went
while
Harry
was
reading
and
rereading
passage
about
the
uses
scurvy
grass
lovage
and
sneezewort
and
not
taking
word
These
plants
are
moste
efficacious
the
inflaming
the
brain
and
are
therefore
much
used
Confusing
and
Befuddlement
Draughts
where
the
wizard
desirous
producing
hot
headedness
and
recklessness
Hermione
said
Sirius
was
becoming
reckless
cooped
Grimmauld
Place
moste
efficacious
the
inflaming
the
brain
and
are
therefore
much
used
theDaily
Prophet
would
think
his
brain
was
inflamed
they
found
out
that
knew
what
Voldemort
was
feeling
therefore
much
used
Confusing
and
Befuddlement
Draughts
confusing
was
the
word
all
right
why
did
know
what
Voldemort
was
feeling
What
was
this
weird
connection
between
them
which
Dumbledore
had
never
been
able
explain
satisfactorily
where
the
wizard
desirous
how
Harry
would
like
sleep
producing
hot
headedness
was
warm
and
comfortable
his
armchair
before
the
fire
with
the
rain
still
beating
heavily
the
windowpanes
Crookshanks
purring
and
the
crackling
the
flames
The
book
slipped
from
Harry
slack
grip
and
landed
with
dull
thud
the
hearthrug
His
head
lolled
sideways
was
walking
once
more
along
windowless
corridor
his
footsteps
echoing
the
silence
the
door
the
end
the
passage
loomed
larger
his
heart
beat
fast
with
excitement
could
only
open
enter
beyond
stretched
out
his
hand
his
fingertips
were
inches
from
Harry
Potter
sir
awoke
with
start
The
candles
had
all
been
extinguished
the
common
room
but
there
was
something
moving
close
Whozair
said
Harry
sitting
upright
his
chair
The
fire
was
almost
out
the
room
very
dark
Dobby
has
your
owl
sir
said
squeaky
voice
Dobby
said
Harry
thickly
peering
through
the
gloom
towards
the
source
the
voice
Dobby
the
house
elf
was
standing
beside
the
table
which
Hermione
had
left
half
dozen
her
knitted
hats
His
large
pointed
ears
were
now
sticking
out
from
beneath
what
looked
like
all
the
hats
Hermione
had
ever
knitted
was
wearing
one
top
the
other
that
his
head
seemed
elongated
two
three
feet
and
the
very
topmost
bobble
sat
Hedwig
hooting
serenely
and
obviously
cured
Dobby
volunteered
return
Harry
Potter
owl
said
the
elf
squeakily
with
look
positive
adoration
his
face
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
says
she
all
well
now
sir
sank
into
deep
bow
that
his
pencil
like
nose
brushed
the
threadbare
surface
the
hearthrug
and
Hedwiggave
indignant
hoot
and
fluttered
the
arm
Harry
chair
Thanks
Dobby
said
Harry
stroking
Hedwig
head
and
blinking
hard
trying
rid
himself
the
image
the
door
his
dream
had
been
very
vivid
Surveying
Dobby
more
closely
noticed
that
the
elf
was
also
wearing
several
scarves
and
innumerable
socks
that
his
feet
looked
far
too
big
for
his
body
have
you
been
takingall
the
clothes
Hermione
been
leaving
out
sir
said
Dobby
happily
Dobby
has
been
taking
some
for
Winky
too
sir
Yeah
how
Winky
asked
Harry
Dobby
ears
drooped
slightly
Winky
still
drinking
lots
sir
said
sadly
his
enormous
round
green
eyes
large
tennis
balls
downcast
She
still
does
not
care
for
clothes
Harry
Potter
Nor
the
other
house
elves
None
them
will
clean
Gryffindor
Tower
any
more
not
with
the
hats
and
socks
hidden
everywhere
they
finds
them
insulting
sir
Dobby
does
all
himself
sir
but
Dobby
does
not
mind
sir
for
always
hopes
meet
Harry
Potter
and
tonight
sir
has
got
his
wish
Dobby
sank
into
deep
bow
again
But
Harry
Potter
does
not
seem
happy
Dobby
went
straightening
again
and
looking
timidly
Harry
Dobby
heard
him
muttering
his
sleep
Was
Harry
Potter
having
bad
dreams
Not
really
bad
said
Harry
yawning
and
rubbing
his
eyes
had
worse
The
elf
surveyed
Harry
out
his
vast
orb
like
eyes
Then
said
very
seriously
his
ears
drooping
Dobby
wishes
could
help
Harry
Potter
for
Harry
Potter
set
Dobby
free
and
Dobby
much
much
happier
now
Harry
smiled
You

help
Dobby
but
thanks
for
the
offer
bent
and
picked
his
Potions
book
have
try
finish
the
essay
tomorrow
closed
the
book
and
did
the
firelight
illuminated
the
thin
white
scars
the
back
his
hand
the
result
his
detentions
with
Umbridge
Wait
moment
there
something
you
can
for
Dobby
said
Harry
slowly
The
elf
looked
round
beaming
Name

Potter
sir
need
find
place
where
twenty
eight
people
can
practise
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
without
being
discovered
any
the
teachers
Especially
Harry
clenched
his
hand
the
book
that
the
scars
shone
pearly
white
Professor
Umbridge
expected
the
elf
smile
vanish
his
ears
droop
expected
him
say
was
impossible
else
that
would
try
find
somewhere
but
his
hopes
were
not
high
What
had
not
expected
was
for
Dobby
give
little
skip
his
ears
waggling
cheerfully
and
clap
his
hands
together
Dobby

perfect
place

said
happily

Harry
curiously
Because

Dobby
seriously
when

real
need
Sometimes

sometimes
not
but
when

always
equipped
for
the
seeker
needs
Dobby

said
the
elf
dropping
his
voice
and
looking
guilty
when
Winky
has
been
very
drunk
has
hidden
her
the
Room
Requirement
and
has
found
antidotes
Butterbeer
there
and

Harry
suddenly
remembering
something
Dumbledore

said

Yule

previous
Christmas

fill
itself
with
chamber
pots

said
Dobby
nodding
earnestly

Harry
sitting
straighter
his
chair
Very

Mostly

Harry
his

perfect
Dobby

Dobby
looking

Harry

For

Harry
was
tempted
with
Dobby
was
halfway
out

intending

Harry
reluctantly
sinking

into
his
chair
This

Listen

you
just
tell
exactly
where

Room
Requirement

how

Their
robes
billowed
and
swirled
around
them
they
splashed
across
the
flooded
vegetable
patch
double
Herbology
where
they
could
hardly
hear
what
Professor
Sprout
was
saying
over
the
hammering

the

The

and
mash
When
looked

pumpkin

found
Hermione
watching
him
What
said
thickly
Well

Dobby

safe
Don

all
the

This

the
Yule
Ball
Hermione
expression
cleared
Dumbledore
told
you
about
Just
passing
said
Harry
shrugging
well
that
all
right
then
said
Hermione
briskly
and
raised
more
objections
Together
with
Ron
they
had
spent
most
the
day
seeking
out
those
people
who
had
signed
their
names
the
list
the
Hog
Head
and
telling
them
where
meet
that
evening
Somewhat
Harry
disappointment
was
Ginny
who
managed
find
Cho
Chang
and
her
friend
first
however
the
end
dinner
was
confident
that
the
news
had
been
passed
every
one
the
twenty
five
people
who
had
turned
the
Hog
Head
half
past
seven
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
left
the
Gryffindor
common
room
Harry
clutching
certain
piece
aged
parchment
his
hand
Fifth
years
were
allowed
out
the
corridors
until
nine
clock
but
all
three
them
kept
looking
around
nervously
they
made
their
way
along
the
seventh
floor
Hold
Harry
warned
unfolding
the
piece
parchment
the
top
the
last
staircase
tapping
with
his
wand
and
muttering
solemnly
swear
that
good
map
Hogwarts
appeared
the
blank
surface
the
parchment
Tiny
black
moving
dots
labelled
with
names
showed
where
various
people
were
Filch
the
second
floor

Harry
holding
the
map
close
his
eyes
and
Mrs
Norris

And
Umbridge

Hermione
anxiously
her

Harry
pointing
let
They
hurried
along
the
corridor
the
place
Dobby
had
described
Harry
stretch

enormous
tapestry
depicting

Harry
quietly
while

paused
his
relentless

the

watch
them
Dobby
said
walk
past
this
bit
wall
three
times
concentrating
hard
what
need
They
did
turning
sharply
the
window
just
beyond
the
blank
stretch
wall
then
the
man
sized
vase
its
other
side
Ron
had
screwed
his
eyes
concentration
Hermione
was
whispering
something
under
her
breath
Harry
fists
were
clenched
stared
ahead
him
need
somewhere
learn
fight
thought
Just
give
place
practise
somewhere
they
can
find
Harry
said
Hermione
sharply
they
wheeled
around
after
their
third
walk
past
highly
polished
door
had
appeared
the
wall
Ron
was
staring
looking
slightly
wary
Harry
reached
out
seized
the
brass
handle
pulled
open
the
door
and
led
the
way
into
spacious
room
lit
with
flickering
torches
like
those
that
illuminated
the
dungeons
eight
floors
below
The
walls
were
lined
with
wooden
bookcases
and
instead
chairs
there
were
large
silk
cushions
the
floor
set
shelves
the
far
end
the
room
carried
range
instruments
such
Sneakoscopes
Secrecy
Sensors
and
large
cracked
Foe
Glass
that
Harry
was
sure
had
hung
the
previous
year
the
fake
Moody
office
These
will
good
when
practising
Stunning
said
Ron
enthusiastically
prodding
one
the
cushions
with
his
foot
And
just
look
these
books
said
Hermione
excitedly
running
finger
along
the
spines
the
large
leather
bound
tomes
Compendium
Common
Curses
and
their
Counter
Actions
The
Dark
Arts
Outsmarted
Self
Defensive
Spellwork
wow
She
looked
around
Harry
her
face
glowing
and
saw
that
the
presence
hundreds
books
had
finally
convinced
Hermione
that
what
they
were
doing
was
right
Harry
this
wonderful
there
everything
need
here
And
without
further
ado
she
slidJinxes
for
the
Jinxed
from
its
shelf
sank
the
nearest
cushion
and
began
read
There
was
gentle
knock
the
door
Harry
looked
round
Ginny
Neville
Lavender
Parvati
and
Dean
had
arrived
Whoa
said
Dean
staring
around
impressed
What
this
place
Harry
began
explain
but
before
had
finished
more
people
had
arrived
and
had
start
all
over
again
the
time
eight
clock
arrived
every
cushion
was
occupied
Harry
moved
across
the
door
and
turned
the
key
protruding
from
the
lock
clicked
satisfyingly
loud
way
and
everybody
fell
silent
looking
him
Hermione
carefully
marked
her
page
ofJinxes
for
the
Jinxed
and
set
the
book
aside
Well
said
Harry
slightly
nervously
This
the
place
found
for
practice
sessions
and
you
obviously
found
fantastic
said
Cho
and
several
people
murmured
their
agreement
bizarre
said
Fred
frowning
around
once
hid
from
Filch
here
remember
George
But
was
just
broom
cupboard
then
Hey
Harry
what
this
stuff
asked
Dean
from
the
rear
the
room
indicating
the
Sneakoscopes
and
the
Foe
Glass
Dark
detectors
said
Harry
stepping
between
the
cushions
reach
them
Basically
they
all
show
when
Dark
wizards
enemies
are
around
but
you
don
want
rely
them
too
much
they
can
fooled
gazed
for
moment
into
the
cracked
Foe
Glass
shadowy
figures
were
moving
around
inside
though
none
was
recognisable
turned
his
back
Well
been
thinking
about
the
sort
stuff

first
and
noticed
raised

Hermione

Cho
once

another
back
flip
Yes

Hermione
unperturbed
makes
formal
and
gives
him
authority

leader
Everybody
put
their
hand
even
Zacharias
Smith
though
did
very
half
heartedly
right
thanks
said
Harry
who
could
feel
his
face
burning
And
what
Hermione
also
think
ought
have
name
she
said
brightly
her
hand
still
the
air
would
promote
feeling
team
spirit
and
unity
don
you
think
Can
the
Anti
Umbridge
League
said
Angelina
hopefully
the
Ministry
Magic

suggested
Fred
was
thinking
said
Hermione
frowning
Fred

didn
tell
everyone

safely
outside
meetings
The
Defence
Association
said
Cho
The
for

Ginny
Only

There
was
good
deal
appreciative
murmuring
and
laughter
this
All
favour
the
said
Hermione
bossily
kneeling
her
cushion
count
That
majority
motion
passed
She
pinned
the
piece
parchment
with
all
their
signatures
the
wall
and
wrote
across
the
top
large
letters
DUMBLEDORE
ARMY
Right
said
Harry
when
she
had
sat
down
again
shall
get
practising
then
was
thinking
the
first
thing
should
isExpelliarmus
you
know
the
Disarming
Charm
know
pretty
basic
but
found
really
useful
please
said
Zacharias
Smith
rolling
his
eyes
and
folding
his
arms
don
thinkExpelliarmus
exactly
going
help
against
You
Know
Who
you
used
against
him
said
Harry
quietly
saved
life
June
Smith
opened
his
mouth
stupidly
The
rest
the
room
was
very
quiet
But
you
think
beneath
you
you
can
leave
Harry
said
Smith
did
not
move
Nor
did
anybody
else
said
Harry
his
mouth
slightly
drier
than
usual
with
all
these
eyes
upon
him
reckon
should
all
divide
into
pairs
and
practise
felt
very
odd
issuing
instructions
but
not
nearly
odd
seeing
them
followed
Everybody
got
their
feet
once
and
divided
Predictably
Neville
was
left
partnerless
You
can
practise
with
Harry
told
him
Right
the
count
three
then
one
two
three
The
room
was
suddenly
full
shouts
ofExpelliarmus
Wands
flew
all
directions
missed
spells
hit
books
shelves
and
sent
them
flying
into
the
air
Harry
was
too
quick
for
Neville
whose
wand
went
spinning
out
his
hand
hit
the
ceiling
shower
sparks
and
landed
with
clatter
top
bookshelf
from
which
Harry
retrieved
with
Summoning
Charm
Glancing
around
thought
had
been
right
suggest
they
practise
the
basics
first
there
was
lot
shoddy
spellwork
going
many
people
were
not
succeeding
Disarming
their
opponents
all
but
merely
causing
them
jump
backwards
few
paces
wince
their
feeble
spell
whooshed
over
them
Expelliarmus
said
Neville
and
Harry
caught
unawares
felt
his
wand
fly
out
his
hand
DID
said
Neville
gleefully
never
done
before
DID
Good
one
said
Harry
encouragingly
deciding
not
point
out
that
real
duel
Neville
opponent
was
unlikely
staring
the
opposite
direction
with
his
wand
held
loosely
his
side
Listen
Neville
can
you
take
turns
practise
with
Ron
and
Hermione
for
couple
minutes
can
walk
around
and
see
how
the
rest
are
doing
Harry
moved
off
into
the
middle
the
room
Something
very
odd
was
happening
Zacharias
Smith
Every
time
opened
his
mouth
disarm
Anthony
Goldstein
his
own
wand
would
fly
out
his
hand
yet
Anthony
did
not
seem
making
sound
Harry
did
not
have
look
far
solve
the
mystery
Fred
and
George
were
several
feet
from
Smith
and
taking
turns
point
their
wands
his
back
Sorry
Harry
said
George
hastily
when
Harry
caught
his
eye
Couldn
resist
Harry
walked
around
the
other
pairs
trying
correct
those
who
were
doing
the
spell
wrong
Ginny
was
teamed
with
Michael
Corner
she
was
doing
very
well
whereas
Michael
was
either
very
bad
unwilling
jinx
her
Ernie
Macmillan
was
flourishing
his
wand
unnecessarily
giving
his
partner
time
get
under
his
guard
the
Creevey
brothers
were
enthusiastic
but
erratic
and
mainly
responsible
for
all
the
books
leaping
off
the
shelves
around
them
Luna
Lovegood
was
similarly
patchy
occasionally
sending
Justin
Finch
Fletchley
wand
spinning
out
his
hand
other
times
merely
causing
his
hair
stand
end
stop
Harry
shouted
Stop
STOP
need
whistle
thought
and
immediately
spotted
one
lying
top
the
nearest
row
books
caught
and
blew
hard
Everyone
lowered
their
wands
That
wasn
bad
said
Harry
but
there
definite
room
for
improvement
Zacharias
Smith
glared
him
Let
try
again
moved
off
around
the
room
again
stopping
here
and
there
make
suggestions
Slowly
the
general
performance
improved
avoided
going
near
Cho
and
her
friend
for
while
but
after
walking
twice
around
every
other
pair
the
room
felt
could
not
ignore
them
any
longer
said
Cho
rather
wildly
approached
Expelliarmious
mean
Expellimellius
sorry
Marietta
Her
curly
haired
friend
sleeve
had
caught
fire
Marietta
extinguished
with
her
own
wand
and
glared
Harry
though
was
his
fault
You
made
nervous
was
doing
all
right
before
then
Cho
told
Harry
ruefully
That
was
quite
good
Harry
lied
but
when
she
raised
her
eyebrows
said
Well
was
lousy
but
know
you
can
properly
was
watching
from
over
there
She
laughed
Her
friend
Marietta
looked
them
rather
sourly
and
turned
away
Don
mind
her
Cho
muttered
She
doesn
really
want
here
but
made
her
come
with
Her
parents
have
forbidden
her
anything
that
might
upset
Umbridge
You
see
her
mum
works
for
the
Ministry
What
about
your
parents
asked
Harry
Well
they
forbidden
get
the
wrong
side
Umbridge
too
said
Cho
drawing
herself
proudly
But
they
think
not
going
fight
You
Know
Who
after
what
happened
Cedric
She
broke
off
looking
rather
confused
and
awkward
silence
fell
between
them
Terry
Boot
wand
went
whizzing
past
Harry
ear
and
hit
Alicia
Spinnet
hard
the
nose
Well
dad
very
supportive
any
anti
Ministry
action
said
Luna
Lovegood
proudly
from
just
behind
Harry
evidently
she
had
been
eavesdropping
his
conversation
while
Justin
Finch
Fletchley
attempted
disentangle
himself
from
the
robes
that
had
flown
over
his
head
always
saying
believe
anything
Fudge
mean
the
number
goblins
Fudge
has
had
assassinated
And
course
uses
the
Department
Mysteries
develop
terrible
poisons
which
secretly
feeds
anybody
who
disagrees
with
him
And
then
there
his
Umgubular
Slashkilter
Don
ask
Harry
muttered
Cho
she
opened
her
mouth
looking
puzzled
She
giggled
Hey
Harry
Hermione
called
from
the
other
end
the
room
have
you
checked
the
time
looked
down
his
watch
and
was
shocked
see
was
already
ten
past
nine
which
meant
they
needed
get
back
their
common
rooms
immediately
risk
being
caught
and
punished
Filch
for
being
out
bounds
blew
his
whistle
everybody
stopped
shouting
Expelliarmus
and
the
last
couple
wands
clattered
the
floor
Well
that
was
pretty
good
said
Harry
but
overrun
better
leave
here
Same
time
same
place
next
week
Sooner
said
Dean
Thomas
eagerly
and
many
people
nodded
agreement
Angelina
however
said
quickly
The
Quidditch
season
about
start
need
team
practices
too
Let
say
next
Wednesday
night
then
said
Harry
can
decide
additional
meetings
then
Come
better
get
going
pulled
out
the
Marauder
Map
again
and
checked
carefully
for
signs
teachers
the
seventh
floor
let
them
all
leave
threes
and
fours
watching
their
tiny
dots
anxiously
see
that
they
returned
safely
their
dormitories
the
Hufflepuffs
the
basement
corridor
that
also
led
the
kitchens
the
Ravenclaws
tower
the
west
side
the
castle
and
the
Gryffindors
along
the
corridor
the
Fat
Lady
portrait
That
was
really
really
good
Harry
said
Hermione
when
finally
was
just
her
Harry
and
Ron
who
were
left
Yeah
was
said
Ron
enthusiastically
they
slipped
out
the
door
and
watched
melt
back
into
stone
behind
them
Did
you
see
disarm
Hermione
Harry
Only
once
said
Hermione
stung
got
you
loads
more
than
you
got
did
not
only
get
you
once
got
you
least
three
times
Well
you
counting
the
one
where
you
tripped
over
your
own
feet
and
knocked
the
wand
out
hand
They
argued
all
the
way
back
the
common
room
but
Harry
was
not
listening
them
had
one
eye
the
Marauder
Map
but
was
also
thinking
Cho
saying
made
her
nervous
THE
LION
AND
THE
SERPENT
Harry
felt
though
were
carrying
some
kind
talisman
inside
his
chest
over
the
following
two
weeks
glowing
secret
that
supported
him
through
Umbridge
classes
and
even
made
possible
for
him
smile
blandly
looked
into
her
horrible
bulging
eyes
and
the
were
resisting
her
under
her
very
nose
doing
the
very
thing
she
and
the
Ministry
most
feared
and
whenever
was
supposed
reading
Wilbert
Slinkhard
book
during
her
lessons
dwelled
instead
satisfying
memories
their
most
recent
meetings
remembering
how
Neville
had
successfully
disarmed
Hermione
how
Colin
Creevey
had
mastered
the
Impediment
Jinx
after
three
meetings
hard
effort
how
Parvati
Patil
had
produced
such
good
Reductor
Curse
that
she
had
reduced
the
table
carrying
all
the
Sneakoscopes
dust
was
finding
almost
impossible
fix
regular
night
the
week
for
the
meetings
they
had
accommodate
three
separate
team
Quidditch
practices
which
were
often
rearranged
due
bad
weather
conditions
but
Harry
was
not
sorry
about
this
had
feeling
that
was
probably
better
keep
the
timing
their
meetings
unpredictable
anyone
was
watching
them
would
hard
make
out
pattern
Hermione
soon
devised
very
clever
method
communicating
the
time
and
date
the
next
meeting
all
the
members
case
they
needed
change
short
notice
because
would
look
suspicious
people
from
different
Houses
were
seen
crossing
the
Great
Hall
talk
each
other
too
often
She
gave
each
the
members
the
fake
Galleon
Ron
became
very
excited
when
first
saw
the
basket
and
was
convinced
she
was
actually
giving
out
gold
You
see
the
numerals
around
the
edge
the
coins
Hermione
said
holding
one
for
examination
the
end
their
fourth
meeting
The
coin
gleamed
fat
and
yellow
the
light
from
the
torches
real
Galleons
that
just
serial
number
referring
the
goblin
who
cast
the
coin
these
fake
coins
though
the
numbers
will
change
reflect
the
time
and
date
the
next
meeting
The
coins
will
grow
hot
when
the
date
changes
you
carrying
them
pocket
you
able
feel
them
take
one
each
and
when
Harry
sets
the
date
the
next
meeting
change
the
numbers
onhis
coin
and
because
put
Protean
Charm
them
they
all
change
mimic
his
blank
silence
greeted
Hermione
words
She
looked
around
all
the
faces
upturned
her
rather
disconcerted
Well
thought
was
good
idea
she
said
uncertainly
mean
even
Umbridge
asked
turn
out
our
pockets
there
nothing
fishy
about
carrying
Galleon
there
But
well
you
don
want
use
them
You
can
Protean
Charm
said
Terry
Boot
Yes
said
Hermione
But
that
that
standard
that
said
weakly
said
Hermione
trying
look
modest
well
yes
suppose
How
come
you
not
Ravenclaw
demanded
staring
Hermione
with
something
close
wonder
With
brains
like
yours
Well
the
Sorting
Hat
did
seriously
consider
putting
Ravenclaw
during
Sorting
said
Hermione
brightly
but
decided
Gryffindor
the
end
does
that
mean
using
the
Galleons
There
was
murmur
assent
and
everybody
moved
forwards
collect
one
from
the
basket
Harry
looked
sideways
Hermione
You
know
what
these
remind
what
that
The
Death
Eaters
scars
Voldemort
touches
one
them
and
all
their
scars
burn
and
they
know
they
got
join
him
Well
yes
said
Hermione
quietly
that
where
got
the
idea
But
you
notice
decided
engrave
the
date
bits
metal
rather
than
our
members
skin
Yeah
prefer
your
way
said
Harry
grinning
slipped
his
Galleon
into
his
pocket
suppose
the
only
danger
with
these
that
might
accidentally
spend
them
Fat
chance
said
Ron
who
was
examining
his
own
fake
Galleon
with
slightly
mournful
air
haven
got
any
real
Galleons
confuse
with
the
first
Quidditch
match
the
season
Gryffindor
versus
Slytherin
drew
nearer
their
meetings
were
put
hold
because
Angelina
insisted
almost
daily
practices
The
fact
that
the
Quidditch
Cup
had
not
been
held
for
long
added
considerably
the
interest
and
excitement
surrounding
the
forthcoming
game
the
Ravenclaws
and
Hufflepuffs
were
taking
lively
interest
the
outcome
for
they
course
would
playing
both
teams
over
the
coming
year
and
the
Heads
House
the
competing
teams
though
they
attempted
disguise
under
decent
pretence
sportsmanship
were
determined
see
their
own
side
victorious
Harry
realised
how
much
Professor
McGonagall
cared
about
beating
Slytherin
when
she
abstained
from
giving
them
homework
the
week
leading
the
match
think
you
got
enough
getting
with
the
moment
she
said
loftily
Nobody
could
quite
believe
their
ears
until
she
looked
directly
Harry
and
Ron
and
said
grimly
become
accustomed
seeing
the
Quidditch
Cup
study
boys
and
really
don
want
have
hand
over
Professor
Snape
use
the
extra
time
practise
won
you
Snape
was
less
obviously
partisan
had
booked
the
Quidditch
pitch
for
Slytherin
practice
often
that
the
Gryffindors
had
difficulty
getting
play
was
also
turning
deaf
ear
the
many
reports
Slytherin
attempts
hex
Gryffindor
players
the
corridors
When
Alicia
Spinnet
turned
the
hospital
wing
with
her
eyebrows
growing
thick
and
fast
they
obscured
her
vision
and
obstructed
her
mouth
Snape
insisted
that
she
must
have
attempted
Hair
thickening
Charm
herself
and
refused
listen
the
fourteen
eye
witnesses
who
insisted
they
had
seen
the
Slytherin
Keeper
Miles
Bletchley
hit
her
from
behind
with
jinx
while
she
worked
the
library
Harry
felt
optimistic
about
Gryffindor
chances
they
had
after
all
never
lost
Malfoy
team
Admittedly
Ron
was
still
not
performing
Wood
standard
but
was
working
extremely
hard
improve
His
greatest
weakness
was
tendency
lose
confidence
after
made
blunder
let
one
goal
became
flustered
and
was
therefore
likely
miss
more
the
other
hand
Harry
had
seen
Ron
make
some
truly
spectacular
saves
when
was
form
during
one
memorable
practice
had
hung
one
handed
from
his
broom
and
kicked
the
Quaffle
hard
away
from
the
goalhoop
that
soared
the
length
the
pitch
and
through
the
centre
hoop
the
other
end
the
rest
the
team
felt
this
save
compared
favourably
with
one
made
recently
Barry
Ryan
the
Irish
International
Keeper
against
Poland
top
Chaser
Ladislaw
Zamojski
Even
Fred
had
said
that
Ron
might
yet
make
him
and
George
proud
and
that
they
were
seriously
considering
admitting
was
related
them
something
they
assured
him
they
had
been
trying
deny
for
four
years
The
only
thing
really
worrying
Harry
was
how
much
Ron
was
allowing
the
tactics
the
Slytherin
team
upset
him
before
they
even
got
the
pitch
Harry
course
had
endured
their
snide
comments
for
over
four
years
whispers
Hey
Potty
heard
Warrington
sworn
knock
you
off
your
broom
Saturday
far
from
chilling
his
blood
made
him
laugh
Warrington
aim
pathetic
more
worried
was
aiming
for
the
person
next
retorted
which
made
Ron
and
Hermione
laugh
and
wiped
the
smirk
off
Pansy
Parkinson
face
But
Ron
had
never
endured
relentless
campaign
insults
jeers
and
intimidation
When
Slytherins
some
them
seventh
years
and
considerably
larger
than
was
muttered
they
passed
the
corridors
Got
your
bed
booked
the
hospital
wing
Weasley
didn
laugh
but
turned
delicate
shade
green
When
Draco
Malfoy
imitated
Ron
dropping
the
Quaffle
which
did
whenever
they
came
within
sight
each
other
Ron
ears
glowed
red
and
his
hands
shook
badly
that
was
likelyto
drop
whatever
was
holding
the
time
too
October
extinguished
itself
rush
howling
winds
and
driving
rain
and
November
arrived
cold
frozen
iron
with
hard
frosts
every
morning
and
icy
draughts
that
bit
exposed
hands
and
faces
The
skies
and
the
ceiling
the
Great
Hall
turned
pale
pearly
grey
the
mountains
around
Hogwarts
were
snowcapped
and
the
temperature
the
castle
dropped
low
that
many
students
wore
their
thick
protective
dragonskin
gloves
the
corridors
between
lessons
The
morning
the
match
dawned
bright
and
cold
When
Harry
awoke
looked
round
Ron
bed
and
saw
him
sitting
bolt
upright
his
arms
around
his
knees
staring
fixedly
into
space
You
all
right
said
Harry
Ron
nodded
but
did
not
speak
Harry
was
reminded
forcibly
the
time
Ron
had
accidentally
put
Slug
vomiting
Charm
himself
looked
just
pale
and
sweaty
had
done
then
not
mention
reluctant
open
his
mouth
You
just
need
some
breakfast
Harry
said
bracingly
mon
The
Great
Hall
was
filling
fast
when
they
arrived
the
talk
louder
and
the
mood
more
exuberant
than
usual
they
passed
the
Slytherin
table
there
was
upsurge
noise
Harry
looked
round
and
saw
that
addition
the
usual
green
and
silver
scarves
and
hats
every
one
them
was
wearing
silver
badge
the
shape
what
seemed
crown
For
some
reason
many
them
waved
Ron
laughing
uproariously
Harry
tried
see
what
was
written
the
badges
walked
but
was
too
concerned
get
Ron
past
their
table
quickly
linger
long
enough
read
them
They
received
rousing
welcome
the
Gryffindor
table
where
everyone
was
wearing
red
and
gold
but
far
from
raising
Ron
spirits
the
cheers
seemed
sap
the
last
his
morale
collapsed
the
nearest
bench
looking
though
were
facing
his
final
meal
must
been
mental
this
said
croaky
whisper
Mental
Don
thick
said
Harry
firmly
passing
him
choice
cereals
you
going
fine
normal
nervous
rubbish
croaked
Ron
lousy
can
play
save
life
What
was
thinking
Get
grip
said
Harry
sternly
Look
that
save
you
made
with
your
foot
the
other
day
even
Fred
and
George
said
was
brilliant
Ron
turned
tortured
face
Harry
That
was
accident
whispered
miserably
didn
mean
slipped
off
broom
when
none
you
were
looking
and
when
was
trying
get
back
kicked
the
Quaffle
accident
Well
said
Harry
recovering
quickly
from
this
unpleasant
surprise
few
more
accidents
like
that
and
the
game
the
bag
isn
Hermione
and
Ginny
sat
down
opposite
them
wearing
red
and
gold
scarves
gloves
and
rosettes
How
you
feeling
Ginny
asked
Ron
who
was
now
staring
into
the
dregs
milk
the
bottom
his
empty
cereal
bowl
though
seriously
considering
attempting
drown
himself
them
just
nervous
said
Harry
Well
that
good
sign
never
feel
you
perform
well
exams
you
not
bit
nervous
said
Hermione
heartily
Hello
said
vague
and
dreamy
voice
from
behind
them
Harry
looked
Luna
Lovegood
had
drifted
over
from
the
Ravenclaw
table
Many
people
were
staring
her
and
few
were
openly
laughing
and
pointing
she
had
managed
procure
hat
shaped
like
life
size
lion
head
which
was
perched
precariously
her
head
supporting
Gryffindor
said
Luna
pointing
unnecessarily
her
hat
Look
what
does
She
reached
and
tapped
the
hat
with
her
wand
opened
its
mouth
wide
and
gave
extremely
realistic
roar
that
made
everyone
the
vicinity
jump
good
isn
said
Luna
happily
wanted
have
chewing
serpent
represent
Slytherin
you
know
but
there
wasn
time
Anyway
good
luck
Ronald
She
drifted
away
They
had
not
quite
recovered

before
Angelina
came
hurrying
towards
them
accompanied
Katie
and
Alicia
whose
eyebrows
had
mercifully
been
returned
normal
Madam
Pomfrey
When
you
ready
she
said
going
straight
down
the
pitch
check
out
conditions
and
change
there
bit
Harry
assured
her
Ron
just
got
have
some
breakfast
became
clear
after
ten
minutes
however
that
Ron
was
not
capable
eating
anything
more
and
Harry
thought
best
get
him
down
the
changing
rooms
they
rose
from
the
table
Hermione
got
too
and
taking
Harry
arm
she
drew
him
one
side
Don
let
Ron
see
what
those
Slytherins
badges
she
whispered
urgently
Harry
looked
questioningly
her
but
she
shook
her
head
warningly
Ron
had
just
ambled
over
them
looking
lost
and
desperate
Good
luck
Ron
said
Hermione
standing
tiptoe
and
kissing
him
the
cheek
And
you
Harry
Ron
seemed
come
himself
slightly
they
walked
back
across
the
Great
Hall
touched
the
spot
his
face
where
Hermione
had
kissed
him
looking
puzzled
though
was
not
quite
sure
what
had
just
happened
seemed
too
distracted
notice
much
around
him
but
Harry
cast
curious
glance
the
crown
shaped
badges
they
passed
the
Slytherin
table
and
this
time
made
out
the
words
etched
them
Weasley
our
King
With
unpleasant
feeling
that
this
could
mean
nothing
good
hurried
Ron
across
the
Entrance
Hall
down
the
stone
steps
and
out
into
the
icy
air
The
frosty
grass
crunched
under
their
feet
they
hurried
down
the
sloping
lawns
towards
the
stadium
There
was
wind
all
and
the
sky
was
uniform
pearly
white
which
meant
that
visibility
would
good
without
the
drawback
direct
sunlight
the
eyes
Harry
pointed
out
these
encouraging
factors
Ron
they
walked
but
was
not
sure
that
Ron
was
listening
Angelina
had
changed
already
and
was
talking
the
rest
the
team
when
they
entered
Harry
and
Ron
pulled
their
robes
Ron
attempted
his
back
front
for
several
minutes
before
Alicia
took
pity
him
and
went
help
then
sat
down
listen
the
pre
match
talk
while
the
babble
voices
outside
grew
steadily
louder
the
crowd
came
pouring
out
the
castle
towards
the
pitch
only
just
found
out
the
final
line
for
Slytherin
said
Angelina
consulting
piece
parchment
Last
year
Beaters
Derrick
and
Bole
have
left
but
looks
though
Montague
replaced
them
with
the
usual
gorillas
rather
than
anyone
who
can
fly
particularly
well
They
two
blokes
called
Crabbe
and
Goyle
don
know
much
about
them
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
Well
they
don
look
bright
enough
tell
one
end
broom
from
the
other
said
Angelina
pocketing
her
parchment
but
then
was
always
surprised
Derrick
and
Bole
managed
find
their
way
the
pitch
without
signposts
Crabbe
and
Goyle
are
the
same
mould
Harry
assured
her
They
could
hear
hundreds
footsteps
mounting
the
banked
benches
the
spectators
stands
Some
people
were
singing
though
Harry
could
not
make
out
the
words
was
starting
feel
nervous
but
knew
his
butterflies
were
nothing
compared
Ron
who
was
clutching
his
stomach
and
staring
straight
ahead
again
his
jaw
set
and
his
complexion
pale
grey
time
said
Angelina
hushed
voice
looking
her
watch
mon
everyone
good
luck
The
team
rose
shouldered
their
brooms
and
marched
single
file
out
the
changing
room
and
into
the
dazzling
sunlight
roar
sound
greeted
them
which
Harry
could
still
hear
singing
though
was
muffled
the
cheers
and
whistles
The
Slytherin
team
was
standing
waiting
for
them
They
too
were
wearing
those
silver
crown
shaped
badges
The
new
Captain
Montague
was
built
along
the
same
lines
Dudley
Dursley
with
massive
forearms
like
hairy
hams
Behind
him
lurked
Crabbe
and
Goyle
almost
large
blinking
stupidly
the
sunlight
swinging
their
new
Beaters
bats
Malfoy
stood
one
side
the
sunlight
gleaming
his
white
blond
head
caught
Harry
eye
and
smirked
tapping
the
crown
shaped
badge
his
chest
Captains

the
referee
Madam
Hooch
Angelina

Harry

that

though
she
did
not
wince
Mount

Madam
Hooch
placed
her

her

and
blew
The
balls
were
released
and
the
fourteen
players
shot
upwards
Out
the
corner
his
eye
Harry
saw
Ron
streak
off
towards
the
goalhoops
Harry
zoomed
higher
dodging
Bludger
and
set
off
wide
lap
the
pitch
gazing
around
for
glint
gold
the
other

the

Draco

exactly

for

the

there
was

Looking

Harry
had
seen

the
tiny
fluttering
Golden
Snitch
was
hovering
feet
from
the
ground
the
Slytherin
end
the
pitch
dived
matter
seconds
Malfoy
was
streaking
out
the
sky
Harry
left
green
and
silver
blur
lying
flat
his
broom
The
Snitch
skirted
the
foot
one
the
goalhoops
and
scooted
off
towards
the
other
side
the
stands
its
change
direction
suited
Malfoy
who
was
nearer
Harry
pulled
his
Firebolt
around
and
Malfoy
were
now
neck
and

Feet
from
the
ground
Harry
lifted
his
right
hand
from
his
broom
stretching
towards
the
Snitch
his
right
Malfoy
arm
extended
too
was
reaching
groping
was
over
two
breathless
desperate
windswept
seconds
Harry
fingers
closed
around
the
tiny
struggling
ball
Malfoy
fingernails
scrabbled
the
back
Harry
hand
hopelessly
Harry
pulled
his
broom
upwards
holding
the
struggling
ball
his
hand
and
the
Gryffindor
spectators
screamed
their
approval
They
were
saved
did
not
matter
that
Ron
had
let
those
goals
nobody
would
remember

Gryffindor

WHAM

squarely
the

Luckily

the

heard
Madam

the

compounded
catcalls
angry

and

thud
then
Angelina
frantic
voice
Are

Harry
grimly
taking
her

and
allowing

Madam
Hooch
was
zooming
towards

the

Harry
heard

from

dismounted
from

over

and
seemed

his

slowly
back
the
changing
rooms
alone
wanted

another

called
Katie
and
Alicia
hugged
Harry
But

Malfoy
who
was

openly
Harry
looked
around
for

Harry
was
not

releasing
George
all
knew
was
that
second
later
both
them
were
sprinting
towards

completely
forgotten
that
all
the

were

all
wanted
was

merely
drew

and
sank

stomach
Harry
HARRY

could
hear

Malfoy
yelling
George
swearing
whistle
blowing
and
the
bellowing
the
crowd
around
him
but
did
not
care
Not
until
somebody
the
vicinity
yelled
Impedimenta
and
was
knocked
over
backwards
the
force
the
spell
did
abandon
the
attempt
punch
every
inch
Malfoy
could
reach
What

Madam

Harry
leapt
his

her
who
had
hit
him
with
the
Impediment
Jinx
she
was
holding
her
whistle
one
hand
and
wand
the
other
her
broom
lay
abandoned
several
feet
away
Malfoy
was
curled
the
ground
whimpering
and
moaning
his
nose
bloody
George
was
sporting
swollen
lip
Fred
was
still
being
forcibly
restrained
the
three
Chasers
and
Crabbe
was
cackling
the
background
never
seen
behaviour
like
back
the
castle
both
you
and
straight
your
Head
House
office
Now
Harry
and
George
turned
their
heels
and
marched
off
the
pitch
both
panting
neither
saying
word
the
other
The
howling
and
jeering
the
crowd
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
they
reached
the
Entrance
Hall
where
they
could
hear
nothing
except
the
sound
their
own
footsteps
Harry
became
aware
that
something
was
still
struggling
his
right
hand
the
knuckles
which
had
bruised
against
Malfoy
jaw
Looking
down
saw
the
Snitch
silver
wings
protruding
from
between
his
fingers
struggling
for
release
They
had
barely
reached
the
door
Professor
McGonagall
office
when
she
came
marching
along
the
corridor
behind
them
She
was
wearing
Gryffindor
scarf
but
tore
from
her
throat
with
shaking
hands
she
strode
towards
them
looking
livid
she
said
furiously
pointing
the
door
Harry
and
George
entered
She
strode
around
behind
her
desk
and
faced
them
quivering
with
rage
she
threw
the
Gryffindor
scarf
aside
the
floor
Well
she
said
have
never
seen
such
disgraceful
exhibition
Two
one
Explain
yourselves
Malfoy
provoked
said
Harry
stiffly
Provoked

shouted
Professor
McGonagall
slamming
fist
her
desk
that
her
tartan
tin
slid
sideways
off
and
burst
open
littering
the
floor
with
Ginger
Newts
just
lost

wanted

But
what

can
have
said
that
justifiedwhat
you
two
insulted
parents
snarled
George
And
Harry
mother
But
instead
leaving
Madam
Hooch
sort
out
you
two
decided
give
exhibition
Muggle
duelling
did
you
bellowed
Professor
McGonagall
Have
you
any
idea
what
you
Hem
hem
Harry
and
George
both
wheeled
round
Dolores
Umbridge
was
standing
the
doorway
wrapped
green
tweed
cloak
that
greatly
enhanced
her
resemblance
giant
toad
and
was
smiling
the
horrible
sickly
ominous
way
that
Harry
had
come
associate
with
imminent
misery
May
help
Professor
McGonagall
asked
Professor
Umbridge
her
most
poisonously
sweet
voice
Blood
rushed
into
Professor
McGonagall
face
Help
she
repeated
constricted
voice
What
you
mean
help
Professor
Umbridge
moved
forwards
into
the
office
still
smiling
her
sickly
smile
Why
thought
you
might
grateful
for
little
extra
authority
Harry
would
not
have
been
surprised
see
sparks
fly
from
Professor
McGonagall
nostrils
You
thought
wrong
she
said
turning
her
back
Umbridge
Now
you
two
had
better
listen
closely
not
care
what
provocation
Malfoy
offered
you
not
care
insulted
every
family
member
you
possess
your
behaviour
was
disgusting
and
giving
each
you
week
worth
detentions
not
look
like
that
Potter
you
deserve
And
either
you
ever
Hem
hem
Professor
McGonagall
closed
her
eyes
though
praying
for
patience
she
turned
her
face
towards
Professor
Umbridge
again
Yes
think
they
deserve
rather
more
than
detentions
said
Umbridge
smiling
still
more
broadly
Professor
McGonagall
eyes
flew
open
But
unfortunately
she
said
with
attempt
reciprocal
smile
that
made
her
look
though
she
had
lockjaw
what
think
that
counts
they
are
House
Dolores
Well
actually
Minerva
simpered
Professor
Umbridge
think
you
find
that
what
thinkdoes
count
Now
where
Cornelius
just
sent
mean
she
gave
false
little
laugh
she
rummaged
her
handbag
the
Minister
just
sent
yes
She
had
pulled
out
piece
parchment
which
she
now
unfurled
clearing
her
throat
fussily
before
starting
read
what
said
Hem
hem
Educational
Decree
Number
Twenty
five
Not
another
one
exclaimed
Professor
McGonagall
violently
Well
yes
said
Umbridge
still
smiling
matter
fact
Minerva
was
you
who
made
see
that
weneeded
further
amendment
you
remember
how
you
overrode
when
was
unwilling
allow
the
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
form
How
you
took
the
case
Dumbledore
who
insisted
that
the
team
allowed
play
Well
now
couldn
have
that
contacted
the
Minister
once
and
quite
agreed
with
that
theHigh
Inquisitor
has
have
the
power
strip
pupils
privileges
she
that
say
would
have
less
authority
than
common
teachers
And
you
see
now
don
you
Minerva
how
right
was
attempting
stop
the
Gryffindor
team
forming
Dreadful
tempers
anyway
was
reading
out
our
amendment
hem
hem
the
High
Inquisitor
will
henceforth
have
supreme
authority
over
all
punishments
sanctions
and
removal
privileges
pertaining
the
students
Hogwarts
and
the
power
alter
such
punishments
sanctions
and

privileges

have
been
ordered

members
Signed

Class

She
rolled
the
parchment
and
put
back
into
her
handbag
still
smiling
really
think
will
have
ban
these
two
from
playing
Quidditch
ever
again
she
said
looking
from
Harry
George
and
back
again
Harry
felt
the
Snitch
fluttering
madly
his
hand
Ban
said
and
his
voice
sounded
strangely
distant
From
playing
ever
again
Yes
Potter
think
lifelong
ban
ought
the
trick
said
Umbridge
her
smile
widening
still
further
she
watched
him
struggle
comprehend
what
she
had
said
Youand
Weasley
here
And
think
safe
this
young
man
twin
ought
stopped
too
his
teammates

But
not
unreasonable
Professor
McGonagall
she
continued
turning
back
Professor
McGonagall
who
was
now
standing
still
though
carved
from
ice
staring
her
The
rest
the
team
can
continue
playing
saw
signs
violence
from
anyof
them
Well
good
afternoon
you
And
with
look
the
utmost
satisfaction
Umbridge
left
the
room
leaving
horrified
silence
her
wake
Banned
said
Angelina
hollow
voice
late
that
evening
the
common
room
Banned
Seeker
and
Beaters
what
earth
are
going
did
not
feel
though
they
had
won
the
match
all
Everywhere
Harry
looked
there
were
disconsolate
and
angry
faces
the
team
themselves
were
slumped
around
the
fire
all
apart
from
Ron
who
had
not
been
seen
since
the
end
the
match
just
unfair
said
Alicia
numbly
mean
what
about
Crabbe
and
that
Bludger
hit
after
the
whistle
had
been
blown
Has

said
Ginny
miserably
she
and
Hermione
were
sitting
either
side
Harry
just
got
lines
heard
Montague
laughing
about
dinner
And
banning
Fred
when
didn
even

said
Alicia
furiously
pummelling
her
knee
with
her
fist

Fred
with
very
ugly
look
his
face
would
pounded
the
little
scumbag
pulp
you
three
hadn
been
holding
back
Harry
stared
miserably
the
dark
window
Snow
was
falling
The
Snitch
had
caught
earlier
was
now
zooming
around
and
around
the
common
room
people
were
watching
its
progress
though
hypnotised
and
Crookshanks
was
leaping
from
chair
chair
trying
catch
going

said
Angelina
getting
slowly
her
feet
Maybe
this
will
all

tomorrow
and
find

She
was
soon
followed
Alicia
and
Katie
Fred
and
George
sloped
off
bed
some
time
later
glowering
everyone
they
passed
and
Ginny
went
not
long
after
that
Only
Harry
and
Hermione
were
left
beside
the
fire
Have
you
seen
Ron
Hermione
asked
low
voice
Harry
shook
his
head
think
avoiding
said
Hermione
Where
you
think
But
that
precise
moment
there
was
creaking
sound
behind
them
the
Fat
Lady
swung
forwards
and
Ron
came
clambering
through
the
portrait
hole
was
very
pale
indeed
and
there
was
snow
his
hair
When
saw
Harry
and
Hermione
stopped
dead
his
tracks
Where
have
you
been
said
Hermione
anxiously
springing
Walking
Ron
mumbled
was
still
wearing
his
Quidditch
things
You
look
frozen
said
Hermione
Come
and
sit
down
Ron
walked
the
fireside
and
sank
into
the
chair
furthest
from
Harry
not
looking
him
The
stolen
Snitch
zoomed
over
their
heads
sorry
Ron
mumbled
looking
his
feet
What
for
said
Harry
For
thinking
can
play
Quidditch
said
Ron
going
resign
first
thing
tomorrow

said
Harry
testily
there
only
three
players
left
the
team
And
when
Ron
looked
puzzled
said
been
given
lifetime
ban
Fred
and
George
What
Ron
yelped
Hermione
told
him
the
full
story
Harry
could
not
bear
tell
again
When
she
had
finished
Ron
looked
more
anguished
than
ever
This
all
fault
You
didn
tmake
punch
Malfoy
said
Harry
angrily
wasn
terrible
Quidditch
got
nothing
with
that
was
that
song
that
wound
would
wound
anyone
Hermione
got
and
walked
the
window
away
from
the
argument
watching
the
snow
swirling
down
against
the
pane
Look
drop
will
you
Harry
burst
out
bad
enough
without
you
blaming
yourself
for
everything
Ron
said
nothing
but
sat
gazing
miserably
the
damp
hem
his
robes
After
while
said
dull
voice
This
the
worst
ever
felt
life
Join
the
club
said
Harry
bitterly
Well
said
Hermione
her
voice
trembling
slightly
can
think
one
thing
that
might
cheer
you
both
yeah
said
Harry
sceptically
Yeah
said
Hermione
turning
away
from
the
pitch
black
snow
flecked
window
broad
smile
spreading
across
her
face
Hagrid
back
HAGRID
TALE
Harry
sprinted
the
boys
dormitories
fetch
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
the
Marauder
Map
from
his
trunk
was
quick
that
and
Ron
were
ready
leave
least
five
minutes
before
Hermione
hurried
back
down
from
the
girls
dormitories
wearing
scarf
gloves
and
one
her
own
knobbly
elf
hats
Well
cold
out
there
she
said
defensively
Ron
clicked
his
tongue
impatiently
They
crept
through
the
portrait
hole
and
covered
themselves
hastily
the
Cloak
Ron
had
grown
much
now
needed
crouch
prevent
his
feet
showing
then
moving
slowly
and
cautiously
they
proceeded
down
the
many
staircases
pausing
intervals
check
the
map
for
signs
Filch
Mrs
Norris
They
were
lucky
they
saw
nobody
but
Nearly
Headless
Nick
who
was
gliding
along
absent
mindedly
humming
something
that
sounded
horribly
like
Weasley
our
King
They
crept
across
the
Entrance
Hall
and
out
into
the
silent
snowy
grounds
With
great
leap
his
heart
Harry
saw
little
golden
squares
light
ahead
and
smoke
coiling
from
Hagrid
chimney
set
off
quick
march
the
other
two
jostling
and
bumping
along
behind
him
They
crunched
excitedly
through
the
thickening
snow
until
last
they
reached
the
wooden
front
door
When
Harry
raised
his
fist
and
knocked
three
times
dog
started
barking
frantically
inside
Hagrid
its
Harry
called
through
the
keyhole
Shoulda

gruff
voice
They
beamed
each
other
under
the
Cloak

could
tell
Hagrid
voice
that
was
pleased

The

open
and
Hagrid

gap
Hermione

Hagrid
hastily
staring
wildly
over
their
heads
Under

Hagrid

was
matted
with
congealed
blood
and
his

been

puffy
slit
amid

purple
and
black
bruising
There
were
many
cuts

Hagrid
glared

Snow

now
Harry
became
aware
that
the
knees
his
robes
were
soaked
through
Fang
was
drooling
with
his
head
Harry
lap
Hagrid
said
Hermione
quietly
after
while
Mmm

anything
about

your
mother
while

Hagrid
unobscured

rested
upon
her
and
Hermione
looked
rather
scared
sorry

Dead
Hagrid
grunted
Died

They

said
Hermione
very
small
voice
Hagrid
shrugged
his
massive
shoulders
need
said
shortly
Can

Wasn

mother
They
were
silent
again
Hermione
glanced
nervously
Harry
and
Ron
plainly
wanting
them
speak
But
you
still
haven
explained
how
you
got
this
state
Hagrid
Ron
said
gesturing
towards
Hagrid
bloodstained
face
why

Harry
Sirius

said
Hagrid
emphatically
But
the
rest
his
words
were
drowned
sudden
outbreak
rapping
the
door
Hermione
gasped
her
mug
slipped
through
her
fingers
and
smashed
the
floor
Fang
yelped
All
four
them
stared
the
window
beside
the
doorway
The
shadow
somebody
small
and
squat
rippled
across
the
thin
curtain
sher
Ron
whispered
Get
under
here
Harry
said
quickly
seizing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
whirled
over
himself
and
Hermione
while
Ron
tore
around
the
table
and
dived
under
the
Cloak
well
Huddled
together
they
backed
away
into
corner
Fang
was
barking
madly
the
door
Hagrid
looked
thoroughly
confused
Hagrid
hide
our
mugs
Hagrid
seized
Harry
and
Ron
mugs
and
shoved
them
under
the
cushion
Fang
basket
Fang
was
now
leaping
the
door
Hagrid
pushed
him
out
the
way
with
his
foot
and
pulled
open
Professor
Umbridge
was
standing
the
doorway
wearing
her
green
tweed
cloak
and
matching
hat
with
earflaps
Lips
pursed
she
leaned
back
see
Hagrid
face
she
barely
reached
his
navel
she
said
slowly
and
loudly
though
speaking
somebody
deaf
You
Hagrid
are
you
Without
waiting
for
answer
she
strolled
into
the
room
her
bulging
eyes
rolling
every
direction
Get
away
she
snapped
waving
her
handbag
Fang
who
had
bounded
her
and
was
attempting
lick
her
face
don
want
ter
rude
said
Hagrid
staring
her
but
who
the
ruddy
hell
are
you
name
Dolores
Umbridge
Her
eyes
were
sweeping
the
cabin
Twice
they
stared
directly
into
the
corner
where
Harry
stood
sandwiched
between
Ron
and
Hermione
Dolores
Umbridge
Hagrid
said
sounding
thoroughly
confused
thought
you
were
one
them
Ministry

with
Fudge

Senior
Undersecretary
the
Minister
yes
said
Umbridge
now
pacing
around
the
cabin
taking
every
tiny
detail
within
from
the
haversack
against
the
wall
the
abandoned
travelling
cloak
now
the
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
Tha

Hagrid
there

and
Hogwarts
High
Inquisitor
said
Umbridge
giving
sign
that
she
had
heard
him
Wha
that
said
Hagrid
frowning
Precisely
what
was
going
ask
said
Umbridge
pointing
the
broken
shards
china
the
floor
that
had
been
Hermione
mug
said
Hagrid
with
most
unhelpful
glance
towards
the
corner
where
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stood
hidden
tha
was
was
Fang
broke
mug
had
ter
use
this
one
instead
Hagrid
pointed
the
mug
from
which
had
been
drinking
one
hand
still
clamped
over
the
dragon
steak
pressed
his
eye
Umbridge
stood
facing
him
now
taking
every
detail
his
appearance
instead
the
cabin
heard
voices
she
said
quietly
was
talkin
ter
Fang
said
Hagrid
stoutly
And
was
talking
back
you
Well
manner
speakin
said
Hagrid
looking
uncomfortable
sometimes
say
Fang
near
enough
human
There
are
three
sets
footprints
the
snow
leading
from
the
castle
doors
your
cabin
said
Umbridge
sleekly
Hermione
gasped
Harry
clapped
hand
over
her
mouth
Luckily
Fang
was
sniffing
loudly
around
the
hem
Professor
Umbridge
robes
and
she
did
not
appear
have
heard
Well
jus
got
back
said
Hagrid
waving
enormous
hand
the
haversack
Maybe
someone
came
ter
call
earlier
missed
There
are
footsteps
leading
away
from
your
cabin
door
Well
don
know
why
that
said
Hagrid
tugging
nervously
his
beard
and
again
glancing
towards
the
corner
where
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stood
though
asking
for
help
Erm
Umbridge
wheeled
round
and
strode
the
length
the
cabin
looking
around
carefully
She
bent
and
peered
under
the
bed
She
opened
Hagrid
cupboards
She
passed
within
two
inches
where
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stood
pressed
against
the
wall
Harry
actually
pulled
his
stomach
she
walked
After
looking
carefully
inside
the
enormous
cauldron
Hagrid
used
for
cooking
she
wheeled
round
again
and
said
What
has
happened

How
did
you
sustain
those
injuries
Hagrid
hastily
removed
the
dragon
steak
from
his
face
which
Harry
opinion
was
mistake
because
the
black
and
purple
bruising
all
around
his
eye
was
now
clearly
visible
not
mention
the
large
amount
fresh
and
congealed
blood

There
was
pause
which
Hagrid
stared
her
with
his
newly
uncovered
eye
Harry
could
almost
hear
his
brain
working
furiously
been
away

said

repeated
Professor
Umbridge
Her

travelled
over
Hagrid

and

and
silently
his
waistcoat

Hagrid
bit
fresh

Umbridge
sweetly
The

Hagrid

flushed
Well

Umbridge

Umbridge
You

Yeah

said
Hagrid
attempting
ingratiating
smile
Harry
noticed
that
two
his
teeth
had
been
knocked
out
Umbridge
looked
him
coldly
his
smile
faltered
Then
she
hoisted
her
handbag
little
higher
into
the
crook
her
arm
and
said

the
Minister

Hagrid
nodding

repeated
blankly

Umbridge
softly
looking

him
with
her

The
Ministry
determined
weed
out
unsatisfactory

Hagrid
Goodnight
She
left
closing
the
door
behind
her
with
snap
Harry
made
pull
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
but
Hermione
seized
his
wrist
Not

she
breathed
his
ear
She

Hagrid

Dumbledore

But
Hagrid

widely
and
cast
one
eyed
look
longing
towards
the
vast
bed
the
corner
Lis
bin
long
day

Hermione

said
Ron
short
while
later
when
having
checked
that
the
coast
was
clear
they
walked
back
the
castle
through
the
thickening
snow
leaving
trace
behind
them
due
the
Obliteration
Charm
Hermione
was
performing
they
went
Then

Hermione
determinedly

Hagrid
THE
EYE
THE
SNAKE
Hermione
ploughed
her
way
back
Hagrid
cabin
through
two
feet
snow
Sunday
morning
Harry
and
Ron
wanted
with
her
but
their
mountain
homework
had
reached
alarming
height
again
they
remained
grudgingly
the
common
room
trying
ignore
the
gleeful
shouts
drifting
from
the
grounds
outside
where
students
were
enjoying
themselves
skating
the
frozen
lake
tobogganing
and
worst
all
bewitching
snowballs
zoom
Gryffindor
Tower
and
rap
hard
the
windows
bellowed
Ron
finally
losing
patience
and
sticking
his
head
out
the
window
prefect
and
one
more
snowball
hits
this
window
OUCH
withdrew
his
head
sharply
his
face
covered
snow
Fred
and
George
said
bitterly
slamming
the
window
behind
him
Gits
Hermione
returned
from
Hagrid
just
before
lunch
shivering
slightly
her
robes
damp
the
knees
said
Ron
looking
when
she
entered
Got
all
his
lessons
planned
for
him
Well
tried
she
said
dully
sinking
into
chair
beside
Harry
She
pulled
out
her
wand
and
gave
complicated
little
wave
that
hot
air
streamed
out
the
tip
she
then
pointed
this
her
robes
which
began
steam
they
dried
out
wasn
even
there
when
arrived
wasknocking
for
least
half
hour
And
then
came
stumping
out
the
Forest
Harry
groaned
The
Forbidden
Forest
was
teeming
with
the
kind
creatures
most
likely
get
Hagrid
the
sack
What
keeping
there
Did
say
asked
said
Hermione
miserably
says
wants
them
surprise
tried
explain
about
Umbridge
but
just
doesn
get
kept
saying
nobody
their
right
mind
would
rather
study
Knarls
than
Chimaeras
don
think
got
Chimaera
she
added
the
appalledlook
Harry
and
Ron
faces
but
that
not
for
lack
trying
from
what
said
about
how
hard
get
eggs
don
know
how
many
times
told
him
better
off
following
Grubbly
Plank
plan
honestly
don
think
listened
half
what
said
bitof
funny
mood
you
know
still
won
say
how
got
all
those
injuries
Hagrid
reappearance
the
staff
table
breakfast
next
day
was
not
greeted
enthusiasm
from
all
students
Some
like
Fred
George
and
Lee
roared
with
delight
and
sprinted
the
aisle
between
the
Gryffindor
and
Hufflepuff
tables
wring
Hagrid
enormous
hand
others
like
Parvati
and
Lavender
exchanged
gloomy
looks
and
shook
their
heads
Harry
knew
that
many
them
preferred
Professor
Grubbly
Plank
lessons
and
the
worst
was
that
very
small
unbiased
part
him
knew
that
they
had
good
reason
Grubbly
Plank
idea
interesting
class
was
not
one
where
there
was
risk
that
somebody
might
have
their
head
ripped
off
was
with
certain
amount
apprehension
that
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
headed
down
Hagrid
Tuesday
heavily
muffled
against
the
cold
Harry
was
worried
not
only
about
what
Hagrid
might
have
decided
teach
them
but
also
about
how
the
rest
the
class
particularly
Malfoy
and
his
cronies
would
behave
Umbridge
was
watching
them
However
the
High
Inquisitor
was
nowhere
seen
they
struggled
through
the
snow
towards
Hagrid
who
stood
waiting
for
them
the
edge
the
Forest
did
not
present
reassuring
sight
the
bruises
that
had
been
purple
Saturday
night
were
now
tinged
with
green
and
yellow
and
some
his
cuts
still
seemed
bleeding
Harry
could
not
understand
this
had
Hagrid
perhaps
been
attacked
some
creature
whose
venom
prevented
the
wounds
inflicted
from
healing
though
complete
the
ominous
picture
Hagrid
was
carrying
what
looked
like
half
dead
cow
over
his
shoulder
workin
here
today
Hagrid
called
happily
the
approaching
students
jerking
his
head
back
the
dark
trees
behind
him
Bit
more
sheltered
Anyway
they
prefer
the
dark
What
prefers
the
dark
Harry
heard
Malfoy
say
sharply
Crabbe
and
Goyle
trace
panic
his
voice
What
did
say
prefers
the
dark
did
you
hear
Harry
remembered
the
only
other
occasion
which
Malfoy
had
entered
the
Forest
before
now
had
not
been
very
brave
then
either
smiled
himself
after
the
Quidditch
match
anything
that
caused
Malfoy
discomfort
was
all
right
with
him
Ready
said
Hagrid
cheerfully
looking
around
the
class
Right
well
bin
savin
trip
inter
the
Forest
fer
yer
fifth
year
Thought
see
these
creatures
their
natural
habitat
Now
what
studyin
today
pretty
rare
reckon
probably
the
only
person
Britain
who
managed
ter
train
And
you
sure
they
trained
are
you
said
Malfoy
the
panic
his
voice
even
more
pronounced
Only
wouldn
the
first
time
you
brought
wild
stuff
class
would
The
Slytherins
murmured
agreement
and
few
Gryffindors
looked
though
they
thought
Malfoy
had
fair
point
too
Course
they
trained
said
Hagrid
scowling
and
hoisting
the
dead
cow
little
higher
his
shoulder
what
happened
your
face
then
demanded
Malfoy
Mind
yer
own
business
said
Hagrid
angrily
Now
yeh
finished
askin
stupid
questions
follow
turned
and
strode
straight
into
the
Forest
Nobody
seemed
much
disposed
follow
Harry
glanced
Ron
and
Hermione
who
sighed
but
nodded
and
the
three
them
set
off
after
Hagrid
leading
the
rest
the
class
They
walked
for
about
ten
minutes
until
they
reached
place
where
the
trees
stood
closely
together
that
was
dark
twilight
and
there
was
snow
all
the
ground
With
grunt
Hagrid
deposited
his
half
cow
the
ground
stepped
back
and
turned
face
his
class
most
whom
were
creeping
from
tree
tree
towards
him
peering
around
nervously
though
expecting
set
upon
any
moment
Gather
roun
gather
roun
Hagrid
encouraged
Now
they
attracted
the
smell
the
meat
but
goin
ter
give
call
anyway
cause
they
like
ter
know
turned
shook
his
shaggy
head
get
the
hair
out
his
face
and
gave
odd
shrieking
cry
that
echoed
through
the
dark
trees
like
the
call
some
monstrous
bird
Nobody
laughed
most
them
looked
too
scared
make
sound
Hagrid
gave
the
shrieking
cry
again
minute
passed
which
the
class
continued
peer
nervously
over
their
shoulders
and
around
trees
for
first
glimpse
whatever
was
that
was
coming
And
then
Hagrid
shook
his
hair
back
for
third
time
and
expanded
his
enormous
chest
Harry
nudged
Ron
and
pointed
into
the
black
space
between
two
gnarled
yew
trees
pair
blank
white
shining
eyes
were
growing
larger
through
the
gloom
and
moment
later
the
dragonish
face
neck
and
then
skeletal
body
great
black
winged
horse
emerged
from
the
darkness
surveyed
the
class
for
few
seconds
swishing
its
long
black
tail
then
bowed
its
head
and
began
tear
flesh
from
the
dead
cow
with
its
pointed
fangs
great
wave
relief
broke
over
Harry
Here
last
was
proof
that
had
not
imagined
these
creatures
that
they
were
real
Hagrid
knew
about
them
too
looked
eagerly
Ron
but
Ron
was
still
staring
around
into
the
trees
and
after
few
seconds
whispered
Why
doesn
Hagrid
call
again
Most
the
rest
the
class
were
wearing
expressions
confused
and
nervously
expectant
Ron
and
were
still
gazing
everywhere
but
the
horse
standing
feet
from
them
There
were
only
two
other
people
who
seemed
able
see
them
stringy
Slytherin
boy
standing
just
behind
Goyle
was
watching
the
horse
eating
with
expression
great
distaste
his
face
and
Neville
whose
eyes
were
following
the
swishing
progress
the
long
black
tail
here
comes
another
one
said
Hagrid
proudly
second
black
horse
appeared
out
the
dark
trees
folded
its
leathery
wings
closer
its
body
and
dipped
its
head
gorge
the
meat
Now
put
yer
hands
who
can
see
Immensely
pleased
feel
that
was
last
going
understand
the
mystery
these
horses
Harry
raised
his
hand
Hagrid
nodded
him
Yeah
yeah
knew
you
able
ter
Harry
said
seriously
you
too
Neville
Excuse
said
Malfoy
sneering
voice
but
what
exactly
are
supposed
seeing
For
answer
Hagrid
pointed
the
cow
carcass
the
ground
The
whole
class
stared
for
few
seconds
then
several
people
gasped
and
Parvati
squealed
Harry
understood
why
bits
flesh
stripping
themselves
away
from
the
bones
and
vanishing
into
thin
air
had
look
very
odd
indeed
What
doing
Parvati
demanded
terrified
voice
retreating
behind
the
nearest
tree
What
eating
Thestrals
said
Hagrid
proudly
and
Hermione
gave
soft
comprehension
Harry
shoulder
Hogwarts

got
whole
herd
here
Now

knows
But
they
really
really
unlucky
interrupted
Parvati
looking
alarmed
They
supposed

all

Professor
Trelawney

Hagrid

Two
more
horses
came
quietly
out
the
trees
one
them
passing
very
close
Parvati
who
shivered
and
pressed
herself
closer
the
tree
saying
think
felt
something
think

Don

said
Hagrid
patiently
Righ

Hermione
raised
her
hand
then
said
Hagrid
beaming
her
The

said

Tha

Hagrid
solemnly
ten
points
ter
Gryffindor
Now
Thestrals
Hem

Professor
Umbridge
had
arrived
She
was
standing
few
feet
away
from
Harry
wearing
her
green
hat
and
cloak
again
her
clipboard
the
ready
Hagrid
who
had
never
heard
Umbridge
fake
cough
before
was
gazing
some
concern
the
closest
Thestral
evidently
under
the
impression
that
had
made
the
sound
Hem

Hagrid
said
smiling
having
located
the
source
the
noise
You

cabin

said
Umbridge
the
same
loud
slow
voice

very
slow

little
confused
Thestrals
said
loudly
Big

his
gigantic
arms

Professor
Umbridge
raised
her
eyebrows
him
and
muttered
she
made

Hagrid
turning
back
the
class
and
looking
slightly
flustered

Umbridge
loudly

Hermione

him
that

Ministry
Magic

Harry
heart
sank
like

but
Hagrid
merely
chuckled
Thestrals

Umbridge

loudly
and
slowly
Please

she
mimed
walking
Malfoy
and
Pansy
Parkinson
were
having
silent
fits
laughter
among
the
students
she
pointed
around
individual
members
the
class
and
ask
them
questions
She
pointed

mouth

talking
Hagrid
stared
her
clearly
complete
loss

why
she
was
acting
though
did
not
understand
normal
English
Hermione
had
tears
fury
her
eyes
now
You
hag
you
evil
hag
she
whispered
Umbridge
walked
towards
Pansy
Parkinson
know
what
you
doing
you
awful
twisted
vicious
Erm
anyway
said
Hagrid
clearly
struggling
regain
the
flow
his
lesson
Thestrals
Yeah
Well
there
loads
good
stuff
abou
them
you
find
said
Professor
Umbridge
ringing
voice
Pansy
Parkinson
that
you
are
able
understand
Professor
Hagrid
when
talks
Just
like
Hermione
Pansy
had
tears
her
eyes
but
these
were
tears
laughter
indeed
her
answer
was
almost
incoherent
because
she
was
trying
suppress
her
giggles
because
well
sounds
like
grunting
lot
the
time
Umbridge
scribbled
her
clipboard
The
few
unbruised
bits
Hagrid
face
flushed
but
tried
act
though
had
not
heard
Pansy
answer
yeah
good
stuff
abou
Thestrals
Well
once
they
tamed
like
this
lot
yeh
never
lost
again
Mazin
sense
direction
jus
tell
where
yeh
want
ter
Assuming
they
can
understand
you
course
said
Malfoy
loudly
and
Pansy
Parkinson
collapsed
fit
renewed
giggles
Professor
Umbridge
smiled
indulgently
them
and
then
turned
Neville
You
can
see
the
Thestrals
Longbottom
can
you
she
said
Neville
nodded
Who
did
you
see
die
she
asked
her
tone
indifferent
grandad
said
Neville
And
what
you
think
them
she
said
waving
her
stubby
hand
the
horses
who
now
had
stripped
great
deal
the
carcass
down
bone
Erm
said
Neville
nervously
with
glance
Hagrid
Well
they
Students
are
too
intimidated
admit
they
are
frightened
muttered
Umbridge
making
another
note
her
clipboard
said
Neville
looking
upset
not
scared
them
quite
all
right
said
Umbridge
patting
Neville
the
shoulder
with
what
she
evidently
intended
understanding
smile
though
looked
more
like
leer
Harry
Well
Hagrid
she
turned
look
him
again
speaking
once
more
that
loud
slow
voice
think
got
enough
getting
along
with
You
will
receive
she
mimed
taking
something
from
the
air
front
her
the
results
your
inspection
she
pointed
the
clipboard
ten
days
time
She
held
ten
stubby
little
fingers
then
her
smile
wider
and
more
toadlike
than
ever
before
beneath
her
green
hat
she
bustled
from
their
midst
leaving
Malfoy
and
Pansy
Parkinson
fits
laughter
Hermione
actually
shaking
with
fury
and
Neville
looking
confused
and
upset
That
foul
lying
twisting
old
gargoyle
stormed
Hermione
half
hour
later
they
made
their
way
back
the
castle
through
the
channels
they
had
made
earlier
the
snow
You
see
what
she
her
thing
about
half
breeds
all
over
again
she
trying
make
out
Hagrid
some
kind
dimwitted
troll
just
because
had
giantess
for
mother
and
not
fair
that
really
wasn
bad
lesson
all
mean
all
right
had
been
Blast
Ended
Skrewts
again
but
Thestrals
are
fine
fact
for
Hagrid
they
really
good
Umbridge
said
they
dangerous
said
Ron
Well
like
Hagrid
said
they
can
look
after
themselves
said
Hermione
impatiently
and
suppose
teacher
like
Grubbly
Plank
wouldn
usually
show
them
before
level
but
well
theyare
very
interesting
aren
they
The
way
some
people
can
see
them
and
some
can
wish
could
you
Harry
asked
her
quietly
She
looked
suddenly
horrorstruck
Harry
sorry
course
don
that
was
really
stupid
thing
say
said
quickly
don
worry
surprised
many
peoplecould
see
them
said
Ron
Three
class
Yeah
Weasley
were
just
wondering
said
malicious
voice
Unheard
any
them
the
muffling
snow
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
walking
along
right
behind
them
you
reckon
you
saw
someone
snuff
you
able
see
the
Quaffle
better
Crabbe
and
Goyle
roared
with
laughter
they
pushed
past
their
way
the
castle
then
broke
into
chorus
Weasley
our
King
Ron
ears
turned
scarlet
Ignore
them
just
ignore
them
intoned
Hermione
pulling
out
her
wand
and
performing
the
charm
produce
hot
air
again
that
she
could
melt
them
easier
path
through
the
untouched
snow
between
them
and
the
greenhouses
December
arrived
bringing
with
more
snow
and
positive
avalanche
homework
for
the
fifth
years
Ron
and
Hermione
prefect
duties
also
became
more
and
more
onerous
Christmas
approached
They
were
called
upon
supervise
the
decoration
the
castle
You
try
putting
tinsel
when
Peeves
has
got
the
other
end
and
trying
strangle
you
with
said
Ron
watch
over
first
and
second
years
spending
their
break
times
inside
because
the
bitter
cold
And
they
cheeky
little
snot
rags
you
know
definitely
weren
that
rude
when
were
first
year
said
Ron
and
patrol
the
corridors
shifts
with
Argus
Filch
who
suspected
that
the
holiday
spirit
might
show
itself
outbreak
wizard
duels
got
dung
for
brains
that
one
said
Ron
furiously
They
were
busy
that
Hermione
had
even
stopped
knitting
elf
hats
and
was
fretting
that
she
was
down
her
last
three
All
those
poor
elves
haven
set
free
yet
having
stay
here
over
Christmas
because
there
aren
enough
hats
Harry
who
had
not
had
the
heart
tell
her
that
Dobby
was
taking
everything
she
made
bent
lower
over
his
History
Magic
essay
any
case
did
not
want
think
about
Christmas
For
the
first
time
his
school
career
very
much
wanted
spend
the
holidays
away
from
Hogwarts
Between
his
Quidditch
ban
and
worry
about
whether
not
Hagrid
was
going
put
probation
felt
highly
resentful
towards
the
place
the
moment
The
only
thing
really
looked
forward
were
the
meetings
and
they
would
have
stop
over
the
holidays
nearly
everybody
the
would
spending
the
time
with
their
families
Hermione
was
going
skiing
with
her
parents
something
that
greatly
amused
Ron
who
had
never
heard
Muggles
strapping
narrow
strips
wood
their
feet
slide
down
mountains
Ron
was
going
home
The
Burrow
Harry
endured
several
days
envy
before
Ron
said
response
Harry
asking
him
how
was
going
get
home
for
Christmas
But
you
coming
too
Didn
say
Mum
wrote
and
told
invite
you
weeks
ago
Hermione
rolled
her
eyes
but
Harry
spirits
soared
the
thought
Christmas
The
Burrow
was
truly
wonderful
though
slightly
marred
Harry
guilty
feeling
that
would
not
able
spend
the
holiday
with
Sirius
wondered
whether
could
possibly
persuade
Mrs
Weasley
invite
his
godfather
for
the
festivities
Even
though
doubted
whether
Dumbledore
would
permit
Sirius
leave
Grimmauld
Place
anyway
could
not
help
but
think
Mrs
Weasley
might
not
want
him
they
were
often
loggerheads
Sirius
had
not
contacted
Harry
all
since
his
last
appearance
the
fire
and
although
Harry
knew
that
with
Umbridge
constant
watch
would
unwise
attempt
contact
him
did
not
like
think
Sirius
alone
his
mother
old
house
perhaps
pulling
lonely
cracker
with
Kreacher
Harry
arrived
early
the
Room
Requirement
for
the
last
meeting
before
the
holidays
and
was
very
glad
had
because
when
the
torches
burst
into
flame
saw
that
Dobby
had
taken
upon
himself
decorate
the
place
for
Christmas
could
tell
the
elf
had
done
because
nobody
else
would
have
strung
hundred
golden
baubles
from
the
ceiling
each
showing
picture
Harry
face
and
bearing
the
legend
HAVE
VERY
HARRY
CHRISTMAS
Harry
had
only
just
managed
get
the
last
them
down
before
the
door
creaked
open
and
Luna
Lovegood
entered
looking
dreamy
usual
Hello
she
said
vaguely
looking
around
what
remained
the
decorations
These
are
nice
did
you
put
them
said
Harry
was
Dobby
the
house
elf
Mistletoe
said
Luna
dreamily
pointing
large
clump
white
berries
placed
almost
over
Harry
head
jumped
out
from
under
Good
thinking
said
Luna
very
seriously
often
infested
with
Nargles
Harry
was
saved
the
necessity
asking
what
Nargles
are
the
arrival
Angelina
Katie
and
Alicia
All
three
them
were
breathless
and
looked
very
cold
Well
said
Angelina
dully
pulling
off
her
cloak
and
throwing
into
corner
finally
replaced
you
Replaced
said
Harry
blankly
You
and
Fred
and
George
she
said
impatiently
got
another
Seeker
Who
said
Harry
quickly
Ginny
Weasley
said
Katie
Harry
gaped
her
Yeah
know
said
Angelina
pulling
out
her
wand
and
flexing
her
arm
but
she
pretty
good
actually
Nothing
you
course
she
said
throwing
him
very
dirty
look
but
can
haveyou
Harry
bit
back
the
retort
was
longing
utter
did
she
imagine
for
second
that
did
not
regret
his
expulsion
from
the
team
hundred
times
more
than
she
did
And
what
about
the
Beaters
asked
trying
keep
his
voice
even
Andrew
Kirke
said
Alicia
without
enthusiasm
and
Jack
Sloper
Neither
them
are
brilliant
but
compared
the
rest
the
idiots
who
turned
The
arrival
Ron
Hermione
and
Neville
brought
this
depressing
discussion
end
and
within
five
minutes
the
room
was
full
enough
prevent
Harry
seeing
Angelina
burning
reproachful
looks
said
calling
them
all
order
thought
this
evening
should
just
over
the
things
done
far
because
the
last
meeting
before
the
holidays
and
there
point
starting
anything
new
right
before
three
week
break
not
doing
anything
new
said
Zacharias
Smith
disgruntled
whisper
loud
enough
carry
through
the
room
known
that
wouldn
have
come
all
really
sorry
Harry
didn
tell
you
then
said
Fred
loudly
Several
people
sniggered
Harry
saw
Cho
laughing
and
felt
the
familiar
swooping
sensation
his
stomach
though
had
missed
step
going
downstairs
can
practise
pairs
said
Harry
start
with
the
Impediment
Jinx
for
ten
minutes
then
can
get
out
the
cushions
and
try
Stunning
again
They
all
divided
obediently
Harry
partnered
Neville
usual
The
room
was
soon
full
intermittent
cries
Impedimenta
People
froze
for
minute
during
which
their
partner
would
stare
aimlessly
around
the
room
watching
other
pairs
work
then
would
unfreeze
and
take
their
turn
the
jinx
Neville
had
improved
beyond
all
recognition
After
while
when
Harry
had
unfrozen
three
times
row
had
Neville
join
Ron
and
Hermione
again
that
could
walk
around
the
room
and
watch
the
others
When
passed
Cho
she
beamed
him
resisted
the
temptation
walk
past
her
several
more
times
After
ten
minutes
the
Impediment
Jinx
they
laid
out
cushions
all
over
the
floor
and
started
practising
Stunning
again
Space
was
really
too
confined
allow
them
all
work
this
spell
once
half
the
group
observed
the
others
for
while
then
swapped
over
Harry
felt
himself
positively
swelling
with
pride
watched
them
all
True
Neville
did
Stun
Padma
Patil
rather
than
Dean
whom
had
been
aiming
but
was
much
closer
miss
than
usual
and
everybody
else
had
made
enormous
progress
the
end
hour
Harry
called
halt
You
getting
really
good
said
beaming
around
them
When
get
back
from
the
holidays
can
start
doing
some
the
big
stuff
maybe
even
Patronuses
There
was
murmur
excitement
The
room
began
clear
the
usual
twos
and
threes
most
people
wished
Harry
Happy
Christmas
they
went
Feeling
cheerful
collected
the
cushions
with
Ron
and
Hermione
and
stacked
them
neatly
away
Ron
and
Hermione
left
before
did
hung
back
little
because
Cho
was
still
there
and
was
hoping
receive
Merry
Christmas
from
her
you
heard
her
say
her
friend
Marietta
and
his
heart
gave
jolt
that
seemed
take
into
the
region
his
Adam
apple
pretended
straightening
the
cushion
pile
was
quite
sure
they
were
alone
now
and
waited
tor
her
speak
Instead
heard
hearty
sniff
turned
and
saw
Cho
standing
the
middle
the
room
tears
pouring
down
her
face
Wha
didn
know
what
She
was
simply
standing
there
crying
silently
What
said
feebly
She
shook
her
head
and
wiped
her
eyes
her
sleeve
sorry
she
said
thickly
suppose
just
learning
all
this
stuff
just
makes
wonder
whether
ifhe
dknown
all
still
alive
Harry
heart
sank
right
back
past
its
usual
spot
and
settled
somewhere
around
his
navel
ought
have
known
She
wanted
talk
about
Cedric
did
know
this
stuff
Harry
said
heavily
was
really
good
could
never
have
got
the
middle
that
maze
But
Voldemort
really
wants
kill
you
you
don
stand
chance
She
hiccoughed
the
sound
Voldemort
name
but
stared
Harry
without
flinching
You
survived
when
you
were
just
baby
she
said
quietly
Yeah
well
said
Harry
wearily
moving
towards
the
door
dunno
why
nor
does
anyone
else
nothing
proud
don
said
Cho
sounding
tearful
again
really
sorry
get
all
upset
like
this
didn
mean
She
hiccoughed
again
She
was
very
pretty
even
when
her
eyes
were
red
and
puffy
Harry
felt
thoroughly
miserable
have
been
pleased
with
just
Merry
Christmas
know
must
horrible
for
you
she
said
mopping
her
eyes
her
sleeve
again
mentioning
Cedric
when
you
saw
him
die
suppose
you
just
want
forget
about
Harry
did
not
say
anything
this
was
quite
true
but
felt
heartless
saying
You
really
good
teacher
you
know
said
Cho
with
watery
smile
never
been
able
Stun
anything
before
Thanks
said
Harry
awkwardly
They
looked
each
other
for
long
moment
Harry
felt
burning
desire
run
from
the
room
and
the
same
time
complete
inability
move
his
feet
Mistletoe
said
Cho
quietly
pointing
the
ceiling
over
his
head
Yeah
said
Harry
His
mouth
was
very
dry
probably
full
Nargles
though
What
are
Nargles
idea
said
Harry
She
had
moved
closer
His
brain
seemed
have
been
Stunned
You
have
ask
Loony
Luna
mean
Cho
made
funny
noise
halfway
between
sob
and
laugh
She
was
even
nearer
him
now
could
have
counted
the
freckles
her
nose
really
like
you
Harry
could
not
think
tingling
sensation
was
spreading
through
him
paralysing
his
arms
legs
and
brain
She
was
much
too
close
could
see
every
tear
clinging
her
eyelashes
returned
the
common
room
half
hour
later
find
Hermione
and
Ron
the
best
seats
the
fire
nearly
everybody
else
had
gone
bed
Hermione
was
writing
very
long
letter
she
had
already
filled
half
roll
parchment
which
was
dangling
from
the
edge
the
table
Ron
was
lying
the
hearthrug
trying
finish
his
Transfiguration
homework
What
kept
you
asked
Harry
sank
into
the
armchair
next
Hermione
Harry
didn
answer
was
state
shock
Half
him
wanted
tell
Ron
and
Hermione
what
had
just
happened
but
the
other
half
wanted
take
the
secret
with
him
the
grave
Are
you
all
right
Harry
Hermione
asked
peering
him
over
the
tip
her
quill
Harry
gave
half
hearted
shrug
truth
didn
know
whether
was
all
right
not
What
said
Ron
hoisting
himself
his
elbow
get
clearer
view
Harry
What
happened
Harry
didn
quite
know
how
set
about
telling
them
and
still
wasn
sure
whether
wanted
Just
had
decided
not
say
anything
Hermione
took
matters
out
his
hands
Cho
she
asked
businesslike
way
Did
she
corner
you
after
the
meeting
Numbly
surprised
Harry
nodded
Ron
sniggered
breaking
off
when
Hermione
caught
his
eye
what
did
she
want
asked
mock
casual
voice
She
Harry
began
rather
hoarsely
cleared
his
throat
and
tried
again
She
Did
you
kiss
asked
Hermione
briskly
Ron
sat
fast
sent
his
ink
bottle
flying
all
over
the
rug
Disregarding
this
completely
stared
avidly
Harry
Well
demanded
Harry
looked
from
Ron
expression
mingled
curiosity
and
hilarity
Hermione
slight
frown
and
nodded
Ron
made
triumphant
gesture
with
his
fist
and
went
into
raucous
peal
laughter
that
made
several
timid
looking
second
years
over
beside
the
window
jump
reluctant
grin
spread
over
Harry
face
watched
Ron
rolling
around
the
hearthrug
Hermione
gave
Ron
look
deep
disgust
and
returned
her
letter
Well
Ron
said
finally
looking
Harry
How
was
Harry
considered
for
moment
Wet
said
truthfully
Ron
made
noise
that
might
have
indicated
jubilation
disgust
was
hard
tell
Because
she
was
crying
Harry
continued
heavily
said
Ron
his
smile
fading
slightly
Are
you
that
bad
kissing
Dunno
said
Harry
who
hadn
considered
this
and
immediately
felt
rather
worried
Maybe
course
you
not
said
Hermione
absently
still
scribbling
away
her
letter
How
you
know
said
Ron
very
sharply
Because
Cho
spends
half
her
time
crying
these
days
said
Hermione
vaguely
She
does
mealtimes
the
loos
all
over
the
place
You
think
bit
kissing
would
cheer
her
said
Ron
grinning
Ron
said
Hermione
dignified
voice
dipping
the
point
her
quill
into
her
inkpot
you
are
the
most
insensitive
wart
have
ever
had
the
misfortune
meet
What
that
supposed
mean
said
Ron
indignantly
What
sort
person
cries
while
someone
kissing
them
Yeah
said
Harry
slightly
desperately
who
does
Hermione
looked
the
pair
them
with
almost
pitying
expression
her
face
Don
you
understand
how
Cho
feeling
the
moment
she
asked
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
Hermione
sighed
and
laid
down
her
quill
Well
obviously
she
feeling
very
sad
because
Cedric
dying
Then
expect
she
feeling
confused
because
she
liked
Cedric
and
now
she
likes
Harry
and
she
can
work
out
who
she
likes
best
Then
she
feeling
guilty
thinking
insult
Cedric
memory
kissing
Harry
all
and
she
worrying
about
what
everyone
else
might
say
about
her
she
starts
going
out
with
Harry
And
she
probably
can
work
out
what
her
feelings
towards
Harry
are
anyway
because
was
the
one
who
was
with
Cedric
when
Cedric
died
that
all
very
mixed
and
painful
and
she
afraid
she
going
thrown
off
the
Ravenclaw
Quidditch
team
because
she
been
flying
badly
slightly
stunned
silence
greeted
the
end
this
speech
then
Ron
said
One
person
can
feel
all
that
once
they
explode
Just
because
you
got
the
emotional
range
teaspoon
doesn
mean
all
have
said
Hermione
nastily
picking
her
quill
again
She
was
the
one
who
started
said
Harry
wouldn
she
just
sort
came
and
next
thing
she
crying
all
over
didn
know
what
Don
blame
you
mate
said
Ron
looking
alarmed
the
very
thought
You
just
had
nice
her
said
Hermione
looking
anxiously
You
were
weren
you
Well
said
Harry
unpleasant
heat
creeping
his
face
sort
patted
her
the
back
bit
Hermione
looked
though
she
was
restraining
herself
from
rolling
her
eyes
with
extreme
difficulty
Well
suppose
could
have
been
worse
she
said
Are
you
going
see
her
again
have
won
said
Harry
got
meetings
haven
You
know
what
mean
said
Hermione
impatiently
Harry
said
nothing
Hermione
words
opened
whole
new
vista
frightening
possibilities
tried
imagine
going
somewhere
with
Cho
Hogsmeade
perhaps
and
being
alone
with
her
for
hours
time
course
she
would
have
been
expecting
him
ask
her
out
after
what
had
just
happened
the
thought
made
his
stomach
clench
painfully
well
said
Hermione
distantly
buried
her
letter
once
more
you
have
plenty
opportunities
ask
her
What
doesn
want
ask
her
said
Ron
who
had
been
watching
Harry
with
unusually
shrewd
expression
his
face
Don
silly
said
Hermione
vaguely
Harry
liked
her
for
ages
haven
you
Harry
did
not
answer
Yes
had
liked
Cho
for
ages
but
whenever
had
imagined
scene
involving
the
two
them
had
always
featured
Cho
who
was
enjoying
herself
opposed
Cho
who
was
sobbing
uncontrollably
into
his
shoulder
Who
you
writing
the
novel
anyway
Ron
asked
Hermione
trying
read
the
bit
parchment
now
trailing
the
floor
Hermione
hitched
out
sight
Viktor
Krum
How
many
other
Viktors
know
Ron
said
nothing
but
looked
disgruntled
They
sat
silence
for
another
twenty
minutes
Ron
finishing
his
Transfiguration
essay
with
many
snorts
impatience
and
crossings
out
Hermione
writing
steadily
the
very
end
the
parchment
rolling
carefully
and
sealing
and
Harry
staring
into
the
fire
wishing
more
than
anything
that
Sirius
head
would
appear
there
and
give
him
some
advice
about
girls
But
the
fire
merely
crackled
lower
and
lower
until
the
red
hot
embers
crumbled
into
ash
and
looking
around
Harry
saw
that
they
were
yet
again
the
last
ones
the
common
room
Well
night
said
Hermione
yawning
widely
she
set
olf
the
girls
staircase
What
does
she
see
Krum
Ron
demanded
and
Harry
climbed
the
boys
stairs
Well
said
Harry
considering
the
matter
pose
older
isn
and
international
Quidditch
player
Yeah
but
apart
from
that
said
Ron
sounding
aggravated
mean
grouchy
git
isn
Bit
grouchy
yeah
said
Harry
whose
thoughts
were
still
Cho
They
pulled
off
their
robes
and
put
pyjamas
silence
Dean
Seamus
and
Neville
were
already
asleep
Harry
put
his
glasses
his
bedside
table
and
got
into
bed
but
did
not
pull
the
hangings
closed
around
his
four
poster
instead
stared
the
patch
starry
sky
visible
through
the
window
next
Neville
bed
had
known
this
time
last
night
that
twenty
four
hours
time
would
have
kissed
Cho
Chang
Night
grunted
Ron
from
somewhere
his
right
Night
said
Harry
Maybe
next
time
there
was
next
time
she
bit
happier
ought
have
asked
her
out
she
had
probably
been
expecting
and
was
now
really
angry
with
him
was
she
lying
bed
still
crying
about
Cedric
did
not
know
what
think
Hermione
explanation
had
made
all
seem
more
complicated
rather
than
easier
understand
That
what
they
should
teach
here
thought
turning
over
his
side
how
girls
brains
work
more
useful
than
Divination
anyway
Neville
snuffled
his
sleep
owl
hooted
somewhere
out
the
night
Harry
dreamed
was
back
the
room
Cho
was
accusing
him
luring
her
there
under
false
pretences
she
said
had
promised
her
hundred
and
fifty
Chocolate
Frog
Cards
she
showed
Harry
protested
Cho
shouted
Cedric
gave
loads
Chocolate
Frog
Cards
look
And
she
pulled
out
fistfuls
Cards
from
inside
her
robes
and
threw
them
into
the
air
Then
she
turned
into
Hermione
who
said
You
did
promise
her
you
know
Harry
think
you
better
give
her
something
else
instead
how
about
your
Firebolt
And
Harry
was
protesting
that
could
not
give
Cho
his
Firebolt
because
Umbridge
had
and
anyway
the
whole
thing
was
ridiculous
only
come
the
room
put
some
Christmas
baubles
shaped
like
Dobby
head
The
dream
changed
His
body
felt
smooth
powerful
and
flexible
was
gliding
between
shining
metal
bars
across
dark
cold
stone
was
flat
against
the
floor
sliding
along
his
belly
was
dark
yet
could
see
objects
around
him
shimmering
strange
vibrant
colours
was
turning
his
head
first
glance
the
corridor
was
empty
but
man
was
sitting
the
floor
ahead
his
chin
drooping
his
chest
his
outline
gleaming
the
dark
Harry
put
out
his
tongue
tasted
the
man
scent
the
air
was
alive
but
drowsy
sitting
front
door
the
end
the
corridor
Harry
longed
bite
the
man
but
must
master
the
impulse
had
more
important
work
But
the
man
was
stirring
silver
cloak
fell
from
his
legs
jumped
his
feet
and
Harry
saw
his
vibrant
blurred
outline
towering
above
him
saw
wand
withdrawn
from
belt
had
choice
reared
high
from
the
floor
and
struck
once
twice
three
times
plunging
his
fangs
deeply
into
the
man
flesh
feeling
his
ribs
splinter
beneath
his
jaws
feeling
the
warm
gush
blood
The
man
was
yelling
pain
then
fell
silent
slumped
backwards
against
the
wall
blood
was
splattering
the
floor
His
forehead
hurt
terribly
was
aching
fit
burst
Harry
HARRY
opened
his
eyes
Every
inch
his
body
was
covered
icy
sweat
his
bed
covers
were
twisted
all
around
him
like
strait
jacket
felt
though
white
hot
poker
were
being
applied
his
forehead
Harry
Ron
was
standing
over
him
looking
extremely
frightened
There
were
more
figures
the
foot
Harry
bed
clutched
his
head
his
hands
the
pain
was
blinding
him
rolled
right
over
and
vomited
over
the
edge
the
mattress
really
ill
said
scared
voice
Should
call
someone
Harry
Harry
had
tell
Ron
was
very
important
that
tell
him
taking
great
gulps
air
Harry
pushed
himself
bed
willing
himself
not
throw
again
the
pain
half
blinding
him
Your
dad
panted
his
chest
heaving
Your
dad
been
attacked
What
said
Ron
uncomprehendingly
Your
dad
been
bitten
serious
there
was
blood
everywhere
going
for
help
said
the
same
scared
voice
and
Harry
heard
footsteps
running
out
the
dormitory
Harry
mate
said
Ron
uncertainly
you
you
were
just
dreaming
said
Harry
furiously
was
crucial
that
Ron
understand
wasn
dream
not
ordinary
dream
was
there
saw
Idid
could
hear
Seamus
and
Dean
muttering
but
did
not
care
The
pain
his
forehead
was
subsiding
slightly
though
was
still
sweating
and
shivering
feverishly
retched
again
and
Ron
leapt
backwards
out
the
way
Harry
you
not
well
said
shakily
Neville
gone
for
help
fine
Harry
choked
wiping
his
mouth
his
pyjamas
and
shaking
uncontrollably
There
nothing
wrong
with
your
dad
you
got
worry
about
need
find
out
where
bleeding
like
mad
was
was
huge
snake
tried
get
out
bed
but
Ron
pushed
him
back
into
Dean
and
Seamus
were
still
whispering
somewhere
nearby
Whether
one
minute
passed
ten
Harry
did
not
know
simply
sat
there
shaking
feeling
the
pain
recede
very
slowly
from
his
scar
then
there
were
hurried
footsteps
coming
the
stairs
and
heard
Neville
voice
again
Over
here
Professor
Professor
McGonagall
came
hurrying
into
the
dormitory
her
tartan
dressing
gown
her
glasses
perched
lopsidedly
the
bridge
her
bony
nose
What
Potter
Where
does
hurt
had
never
been
pleased
see
her
was
member
the
Order
the
Phoenix
needed
now
not
someone
fussing
over
him
and
prescribing
useless
potions
Ron
dad
said
sitting
again
been
attacked
snake
and
serious
saw
happen
What
you
mean
you
saw
happen
said
Professor
McGonagall
her
dark
eyebrows
contracting
don
know
was
asleep
and
then
was
there
You
mean
you
dreamed
this
said
Harry
angrily
would
none
them
understand
was
having
dream
first
about
something
completely
different
something
stupid
and
then
this
interrupted
was
real
didn
imagine
Weasley
was
asleep
the
floor
and
was
attacked
gigantic
snake
there
was
load
blood
collapsed
someone
got
find
out
where
Professor
McGonagall
was
gazing
him
through
her
lopsided
spectacles
though
horrified
what
she
was
seeing
not
lying
and
not
mad
Harry
told
her
his
voice
rising
shout
tell
you
saw
happen
believe
you
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
curtly
Put
your
dressing
gown
going
see
the
Headmaster
MUNGO
HOSPITAL
FOR
MAGICAL
MALADIES
AND
INJURIES
Harry
was
relieved
she
was
taking
him
seriously
that
did
not
hesitate
but
jumped
out
bed
once
pulled
his
dressing
gown
and
pushed
his
glasses
back
his
nose
Weasley
you
ought
come
too
said
Professor
McGonagall
They
followed
Professor
McGonagall
past
the
silent
figures
Neville
Dean
and
Seamus
out
the
dormitory
down
the
spiral
stairs
into
the
common
room
through
the
portrait
hole
and
off
along
the
Fat
Lady
moonlit
corridor
Harry
felt
though
the
panic
inside
him
might
spill
over
any
moment
wanted
run
yell
for
Dumbledore
Weasley
was
bleeding
they
walked
along
sedately
and
what
those
fangs
Harry
tried
hard
not
think
fangs
had
been
poisonous
They
passed
Mrs
Norris
who
turned
her
lamplike
eyes
upon
them
and
hissed
faintly
but
Professor
McGonagall
said
Shoo
Mrs
Norris
slunk
away
into
the
shadows
and
few
minutes
they
had
reached
the
stone
gargoyle
guarding
the
entrance
Dumbledore
office
Fizzing
Whizzbee
said
Professor
McGonagall
The
gargoyle
sprang
life
and
leapt
aside
the
wall
behind
split
two
reveal
stone
staircase
that
was
moving
continually
upwards
like
spiral
escalator
The
three
them
stepped
the
moving
stairs
the
wall
closed
behind
them
with
thud
and
they
were
moving
upwards
tight
circles
until
they
reached
the
highly
polished
oak
door
with
the
brass
knocker
shaped
like
griffin
Though
was
now
well
past
midnight
there
were
voices
coming
from
inside
the
room
positive
babble
them
sounded
though
Dumbledore
was
entertaining
least
dozen
people
Professor
McGonagall
rapped
three
times
with
the
griffin
knocker
and
the
voices
ceased
abruptly
though
someone
had
switched
them
all
off
The
door
opened
its
own
accord
and
Professor
McGonagall
led
Harry
and
Ron
inside
The
room
was
half
darkness
the
strange
silver
instruments
standing
tables
were
silent
and
still
rather
than
whirring
and
emitting
puffs
smoke
they
usually
did
the
portraits
old
headmasters
and
headmistresses
covering
the
walls
were
all
snoozing
their
frames
Behind
the
door
magnificent
red
and
gold
bird
the
size
swan
dozed
its
perch
with
its
head
under
its
wing
you
Professor
McGonagall
and
Dumbledore
was
sitting
high
backed
chair
behind
his
desk
leaned
forward
into
the
pool
candlelight
illuminating
the
papers
laid
out
before
him
was
wearing
magnificently
embroidered
purple
and
gold
dressing
gown
over
snowy
white
nightshirt
but
seemed
wide
awake
his
penetrating
light
blue
eyes
fixed
intently
upon
Professor
McGonagall
Professor
Dumbledore
Potter
has
had
well
nightmare
said
Professor
McGonagall
says
wasn
nightmare
said
Harry
quickly
Professor
McGonagall
looked
round
Harry
frowning
slightly
Very
well
then
Potter
you
tell
the
Headmaster
about
well
was
asleep
said
Harry
and
even
his
terror
and
his
desperation
make
Dumbledore
understand
felt
slightly
irritated
that
the
Headmaster
was
not
looking
him
but
examining
his
own
interlocked
fingers
But
wasn
ordinary
dream
was
real
saw
happen
took
deep
breath
Ron
dad
Weasley
has
been
attacked
giant
snake
The
words
seemed
reverberate
the
air
after
had
said
them
sounding
slightly
ridiculous
even
comic
There
was
pause
which
Dumbledore
leaned
back
and
stared
meditatively
the
ceiling
Ron
looked
from
Harry
Dumbledore
white
faced
and
shocked
How
did
you
see
this
Dumbledore
asked
quietly
still
not
looking
Harry
Well
don
know
said
Harry
rather
angrily
what
did
matter
Inside
head
suppose
You
misunderstand
said
Dumbledore
still
the
same
calm
tone
mean
can
you
remember
where
you
were
positioned
you
watched
this
attack
happen
Were
you
perhaps
standing
beside
the
victim
else
looking
down
the
scene
from
above
This
was
such
curious
question
that
Harry
gaped
Dumbledore
was
almost
though
knew
was
the
snake
said
saw
all
from
the
snake
point
view
Nobody
else
spoke
for
moment
then
Dumbledore
now
looking
Ron
who
was
still
whey
faced
asked
new
and
sharper
voice
Arthur
seriously
injured
Yes
said
Harry
emphatically
why
were
they
all
slow
the
uptake
did
they
not
realise
how
much
person
bled
when
fangs
that
long
pierced
their
side
And
why
could
Dumbledore
not
him
the
courtesy
looking
him
But
Dumbledore
stood
quickly
made
Harry
jump
and
addressed
one
the
old
portraits
hanging
very
near
the
ceiling
Everard
said
sharply
And
you
too
Dilys
sallow
faced
wizard
with
short
black
fringe
and
elderly
witch
with
long
silver
ringlets
the
frame
beside
him
both
whom
seemed
have
been
the
deepest
sleeps
opened
their
eyes
immediately
You
were
listening
said
Dumbledore
The
wizard
nodded
the
witch
said
Naturally
The
man
has
red
hair
and
glasses
said
Dumbledore
Everard
you
will
need
raise
the
alarm
make
sure
found
the
right
people
Both
nodded
and
moved
sideways
out
their
frames
but
instead
emerging
neighbouring
pictures
usually
happened
Hogwarts
neither
reappeared
One
frame
now
contained
nothing
but
backdrop
dark
curtain
the
other
handsome
leather
armchair
Harry
noticed
that
many
the
other
headmasters
and
mistresses
the
walls
though
snoring
and
drooling
most
convincingly
kept
sneaking
peeks
him
from
under
their
eyelids
and
suddenly
understood
who
had
been
talking
when
they
had
knocked
Everard
and
Dilys
were
two
Hogwarts
most
celebrated
Heads
Dumbledore
said
now
sweeping
around
Harry
Ron
and
Professor
McGonagall
approach
the
magnificent
sleeping
bird
his
perch
beside
the
door
Their
renown
such
that
both
have
portraits
hanging
other
important
wizarding
institutions
they
are
free
move
between
their
own
portraits
they
can
tell
what
may
happening
elsewhere
But
Weasley
could
anywhere
said
Harry
Please
sit
down
all
three
you
said
Dumbledore
though
Harry
had
not
spoken
Everard
and
Dilys
may
not
back
for
several
minutes
Professor
McGonagall
you
could
draw
extra
chairs
Professor
McGonagall
pulled
her
wand
from
the
pocket
her
dressing
gown
and
waved
three
chairs
appeared
out
thin
air
straight
backed
and
wooden
quite
unlike
the
comfortable
chintz
armchairs
that
Dumbledore
had
conjured
Harry
hearing
Harry
sat
down
watching
Dumbledore
over
his
shoulder
Dumbledore
was
now
stroking
Fawkes
plumed
golden
head
with
one
finger
The
phoenix
awoke
immediately
stretched
his
beautiful
head
high
and
observed
Dumbledore
through
bright
dark
eyes
will
need
Dumbledore
said
very
quietly
the
bird
warning
There
was
flash
fire
and
the
phoenix
had
gone
Dumbledore
now
swooped
down
upon
one
the
fragile
silver
instruments
whose
function
Harry
had
never
known
carried
over
his
desk
sat
down
facing
them
again
and
tapped
gently
with
the
tip
his
wand
The
instrument
tinkled
into
life
once
with
rhythmic
clinking
noises
Tiny
puffs
pale
green
smoke
issued
from
the
minuscule
silver
tube
the
top
Dumbledore
watched
the
smoke
closely
his
brow
furrowed
After
few
seconds
the
tiny
puffs
became
steady
stream
smoke
that
thickened
and
coiled
the
air
serpent
head
grew
out
the
end
opening
its
mouth
wide
Harry
wondered
whether
the
instrument
was
confirming
his
story
looked
eagerly
Dumbledore
for
sign
that
was
right
but
Dumbledore
did
not
look
Naturally
naturally
murmured
Dumbledore
apparently
himself
still
observing
the
stream
smoke
without
the
slightest
sign
surprise
But
essence
divided
Harry
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
this
question
The
smoke
serpent
however
split
itself
instantly
into
two
snakes
both
coiling
and
undulating
the
dark
air
With
look
grim
satisfaction
Dumbledore
gave
the
instrument
another
gentle
tap
with
his
wand
the
clinking
noise
slowed
and
died
and
the
smoke
serpents
grew
faint
became
formless
haze
and
vanished
Dumbledore
replaced
the
instrument
its
spindly
little
table
Harry
saw
many
the
old
headmasters
the
portraits
follow
him
with
their
eyes
then
realising
that
Harry
was
watching
them
hastily
pretend
sleeping

Harry
wanted

what
the
strange
silver
instrument
was
for
but
before
could
there
was
shout
from
the
top
the
wall
their
right
the
wizard
called
Everard

reappeared

slightly

And

and
said

Professor
McGonagall
got
and
moved
swiftly
the
door
Harry
cast
sideways
glance
Ron
who
was
looking
terrified
And
Dumbledore
what
about
Molly
said
Professor
McGonagall
pausing
the
door
That

said
Dumbledore
But
she
may
already
know
that
excellent
clock
hers
Harry
knew
Dumbledore
was
referring
the
clock
that
told
not
the
time
but
the
whereabouts
and
conditions
the
various
Weasley
family
members
and
with
pang
thought
that
Weasley
hand
must
even
now
pointing
atmortal
peril
But
was
very
late
Mrs
Weasley
was
probably
asleep
not
watching
the
clock
Harry
felt
cold
remembered
Mrs
Weasley
Boggart
turning
into
Weasley
lifeless
body
his
glasses
askew
blood
running
down
his
face
but
Weasley
wasn
going
die
couldn
Dumbledore
was
now
rummaging
cupboard
behind
Harry
and
Ron
emerged
from
carrying
blackened
old
kettle
which
placed
carefully
his
desk
raised
his
wand
and
murmured
Portus
For
moment
the
kettle
trembled
glowing
with
odd
blue
light
then
quivered
rest
solidly
black
ever
Dumbledore
marched
over
another
portrait
this
time
clever
looking
wizard
with
pointed
beard
who
had
been
painted
wearing
the
Slytherin
colours
green
and
silver
and
was
apparently
sleeping
deeply
that
could
not
hear
Dumbledore
voice
when
attempted
rouse
him
Phineas
Phineas
The
subjects
the
portraits
lining
the
room
were
longer
pretending
asleep
they
were
shifting
around
their
frames
the
better
watch
what
was
happening
When
the
clever
looking
wizard
continued
feign
sleep
some
them
shouted
his
name
too
Phineas
Phineas
PHINEAS
could
not
pretend
any
longer
gave
theatrical
jerk
and
opened
his
eyes
wide
Did
someone
call
need
you
visit
your
other
portrait
again
Phineas
said
Dumbledore
got
another
message
Visit
other
portrait
said
Phineas
reedy
voice
giving
long
fake
yawn
his
eyes
travelling
around
the
room
and
focusing
Harry
Dumbledore
too
tired
tonight
Something
about
Phineas
voice
was
familiar
Harry
where
had
heard
before
But
before
could
think
the
portraits
the
surrounding
walls
broke
into
storm
protest
Insubordination
sir
roared
corpulent
red
nosed
wizard
brandishing
his
fists
Dereliction

cried
frail

whom
Harry
recognised

Dumbledore
called
gimlet

witch
raising
unusually
thick
wand
that
looked
not
unlike

verywell
said
the
wizard
called
Phineas
eyeing
the

with
mild
apprehension
though

well
have
destroyed

now
done
away
with
most
the
family
Sirius
knows

your
portrait
said
Dumbledore
and
Harry
realised
immediately
where
had
heard
Phineas
voice
before
issuing
from
the
apparently
empty
frame
his
bedroom
Grimmauld
Place
You

repeated
Phineas
bored
voice
Yes
yes
very
well
sloped
away
into
the
frame
the
portrait
and
disappeared
from
view
the
very
moment
the
study
door
opened
again
Fred
George
and
Ginny
were
ushered
inside
Professor
McGonagall
all
three
them
looking
dishevelled
and
shocked
still
their
night
things
Harry
what

Ginny
who
looked
frightened
Professor
McGonagall

Fred
looking

Floo

Dumbledore

There
was

floor

said
bored
voice
behind
Dumbledore
the
wizard
called
Phineas

reappeared

his
Slytherin
banner
great

always
had
odd
taste
house
guests
Come
here
then
Dumbledore
said
Harry
and
the
Weasleys
And
quickly
before
anyone
else
joins
Harry
and
the
others
gathered
around
Dumbledore
desk
You
have
all
used
Portkey
before
asked
Dumbledore
and
they
nodded
each
reaching
out
touch
some
part
the
blackened
kettle
Good
the
count
three
then
one
two
happened
fraction
second
the
infinitesimal
pause
before
Dumbledore
said
three
Harry
looked
him
they
were
very
close
together
and
Dumbledore
clear
blue
gaze
moved
from
the
Portkey
Harry
face
once
Harry
scar
burned
white
hot
though
the
old
wound
had
burst
open
again
and
unbidden
unwanted
but
terrifyingly
strong
there
rose
within
Harry
hatred
powerful
felt
for
that
instant
would
like
nothing
better
than
strike
bite
sink
his
fangs
into
the
man
before
him
three
Harry
felt
powerful
jerk
behind
his
navel
the
ground
vanished
from
beneath
his
feet
his
hand
was
glued
the
kettle
was
banging
into
the
others
they
all
sped
forwards
swirl
colours
and
rush
wind
the
kettle
pulling
them
onwards
until
his
feet
hit
the
ground
hard
his
knees
buckled
the
kettle
clattered
the
ground
and
somewhere
close
hand
voice
said
Back
again
the
blood
traitor
brats
true
their
father
dying
OUT
roared
second
voice
Harry
scrambled
his
feet
and
looked
around
they
had
arrived
the
gloomy
basement
kitchen
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
The
only
sources
light
were
the
fire
and
one
guttering
candle
which
illuminated
the
remains
solitary
supper
Kreacher
was
disappearing
through
the
door
the
hall
looking
back
them
malevolently
hitched
his
loincloth
Sirius
was
hurrying
towards
them
all
looking
anxious
was
unshaven
and
still
his
day
clothes
there
was
also
slightly
Mundungus
like
whiff
stale
drink
about
him
What
going
said
stretching
out
hand
help
Ginny
Phineas
Nigellus
said
Arthur
been
badly
injured
Ask
Harry
said
Fred
Yeah
want
hear
this
for
myself
said
George
The
twins
and
Ginny
were
staring
him
Kreacher
footsteps
had
stopped
the
stairs
outside
was
Harry
began
this
was
even
worse
than
telling
McGonagall
and
Dumbledore
had
kind
vision
And
told
them
all
that
had
seen
though
altered
the
story
that
sounded
though
had
watched
from
the
sidelines
the
snake
attacked
rather
than
from
behind
the
snake
own
eyes
Ron
who
was
still
very
white
gave
him
fleeting
look
but
did
not
speak
When
Harry
had
finished
Fred
George
and
Ginny
continued
stare
him
for
moment
Harry
did
not
know
whether
was
imagining
not
but
fancied
there
was
something
accusatory
their
looks
Well
they
were
going
blame
him
just
for
seeing
the
attack
was
glad
had
not
told
them
that
had
been
inside
the
snake
the
time
Mum
here
said
Fred
turning
Sirius
She
probably
doesn
even
know
what
happened
yet
said
Sirius
The
important
thing
was
get
you
away
before
Umbridge
could
interfere
expect
Dumbledore
letting
Molly
know
now
got
Mungo
said
Ginny
urgently
She
looked
around
her
brothers
they
were
course
still
their
pyjamas
Sirius
can
you
lend
cloaks
anything
Hang
you
can
tearing
off
Mungo
said
Sirius
Course
can
Mungo
want
said
Fred
with
mulish
expression
our
dad
And
how
are
you
going
explain
how
you
knew
Arthur
was
attacked
before
the
hospital
even
let
his
wife
know
What
does
that
matter
said
George
hotly
matters
because
don
want
draw
attention
the
fact
that
Harry
having
visions
things
that
are
happening
hundreds
miles
away
said
Sirius
angrily
Have
you
any
idea
what
the
Ministry
would
make
that
information
Fred
and
George
looked
though
they
could
not
care
less
what
the
Ministry
made
anything
Ron
was
still
ashen
faced
and
silent
Ginny
said
Somebody
else
could
have
told
could
have
heard
somewhere
other
than
Harry
Like
who
said
Sirius
impatiently
Listen
your
dad
been
hurt
while
duty
for
the
Order
and
the
circumstances
are
fishy
enough
without
his
children
knowing
about
seconds
after
happened
you
could
seriously
damage
the
Order
don
care
about
the
dumb
Order
shouted
Fred
our
dad
dying
talking
about
yelled
George
Your
father
knew
what
was
getting
into
and
won
thank
you
for
messing
things
for
the
Order
said
Sirius
equally
angry
This
how
this
why
you
not
the
Order
you
don
understand
there
are
things
worth
dying
for
Easy
for
you
say
stuck
here
bellowed
Fred
don
see
you
risking
your
neck
The
little
colour
remaining
Sirius
face
drained
from
looked
for
moment
though
would
quite
like
hit
Fred
but
when
spoke
was
voice
determined
calm
know
hard
but
all
got
act
though
don
know
anything
yet
got
stay
put
least
until
hear
from
your
mother
all
right
Fred
and
George
still
looked
mutinous
Ginny
however
took
few
steps
over
the
nearest
chair
and
sank
into
Harry
looked
Ron
who
made
funny
movement
somewhere
between
nod
and
shrug
and
they
sat
down
too
The
twins
glared
Sirius
for
another
minute
then
took
seats
either
side
Ginny
That
right
said
Sirius
encouragingly
come
let
all
let
all
have
drink
while
waiting
Accio
Butterbeer
raised
his
wand
spoke
and
half
dozen
bottles
came
flying
towards
them
out
the
pantry
skidded
along
the
table
scattering
the
debris
Sinus
meal
and
stopped
neatly
front
the
six
them
They
all
drank
and
for
while
the
only
sounds
were
those
the
crackling
the
kitchen
fire
and
the
soft
thud
their
bottles
the
table
Harry
was
only
drinking
have
something
with
his
hands
His
stomach
was
full
horrible
hot
bubbling
guilt
They
would
not
here
were
not
for
him
they
would
all
still
asleep
bed
And
was
good
telling
himself
that
raising
the
alarm
had
ensured
that
Weasley
was
found
because
there
was
also
the
inescapable
business
being
who
had
attacked
Weasley
the
first
place
Don
stupid
you
haven
got
fangs
told
himself
trying
keep
calm
though
the
hand
his
Butterbeer
bottle
was
shaking
you
were
lying
bed
you
weren
attacking
anyone
But
then
what
just
happened
Dumbledore

asked
himself
felt
like
wanted
attack
Dumbledore
too
put
the
bottle
down
little
harder
than
meant
and
slopped
over
the
table
one
took
any
notice
Then
burst
fire
midair
illuminated
the
dirty
plates
front
them
and
they
gave
cries
shock
scroll

fell
with
thud
the

said
Sirius
once
snatching
the
parchment
That
not
Dumbledore

must
message
from
your
mother
here
thrust
the
letter
into
George
hand
who
ripped
open
and
read
aloud
Dad

alive
setting
out
for
Mungo
now
Stay
where
you
are
will
send

Mum
George
looked
around
the
table
Still
alive
said
slowly
But
that
makes
sound
did
not
need
finish
the
sentence
sounded
Harry
too
though
Weasley
was
hovering
somewhere
between
life
and
death
Still
exceptionally
pale
Ron
stared
the
back
his
mother
letter
though
might
speak
words
comfort
him
Fred
pulled
the
parchment
out
George
hands
and
read
for
himself
then
looked
Harry
who
felt
his
hand
shaking
his
Butterbeer
bottle
again
and
clenched
more
tightly
stop
the
trembling
Harry
had
ever
sat
through
longer
night
than
this
one
could
not
remember
Sirius
suggested
once
without
any
real
conviction
that
they
all
bed
but
the
Weasleys
looks
disgust
were
answer
enough
They
mostly
sat
silence
around
the
table
watching
the
candle
wick
sinking
lower
and
lower
into
liquid
wax
occasionally
raising
bottle
their
lips
speaking
only
check
the
time
wonder
aloud
what
was
happening
and
reassure
each
other
that
there
was
bad
news
they
would
know
straightaway
for
Mrs
Weasley
must
long
since
have
arrived
Mungo
Fred
fell
into
doze
his
head
lolling
sideways
his
shoulder
Ginny
was
curled
like
cat
her
chair
but
her
eyes
were
open
Harry
could
see
them
reflecting
the
firelight
Ron
was
sitting
with
his
head
his
hands
whether
awake
asleep
was
impossible
tell
Harry
and
Sirius
looked
each
other
every
often
intruders
upon
the
family
grief
waiting
waiting
ten
past
five
the
morning
Ron
watch
the
kitchen
door
swung
open
and
Mrs
Weasley
entered
the
kitchen
She
was
extremely
pale
but
when
they
all
turned
look
her
Fred
Ron
and
Harry
half
rising
from
their
chairs
she
gave
wan
smile
going
all
right
she
said
her
voice
weak
with
tiredness
sleeping
can
all
and
see
him
later
Bill
sitting
with
him
now
going
take
the
morning
off

Fred
fell
back
into
his
chair
with
his
hands
over
his
face
George
and
Ginny
got
walked
swiftly
over
their
mother
and
hugged
her
Ron
gave
very
shaky
laugh
and
downed
the
rest

Butterbeer

Breakfast

Sirius
loudly
and
joyfully
jumping
his
feet
Where

Sirius
counting

and
some
tea
and
toast
Harry
hurried
over
the
stove
help
did
not
want
intrude
the
Weasleys
happiness
and
dreaded
the
moment
when
Mrs
Weasley
would
ask
him
recount
his
vision
However
had
barely
taken
plates
from
the
dresser
when
Mrs
Weasley
lifted
them
out
his
hands
and
pulled
him
into
hug
don
know
what
would
have
happened
hadn
been
for
you
Harry
she
said
muffled
voice
They
might
not
have
found
Arthur
for
hours
and
then
would
have
been
too
late
but
thanks

alive
and
Dumbledore

able
think
good
cover
story
for
Arthur
being
where

what
trouble

have
been
otherwise
look
poor
Sturgis
Harry
could
hardly
bear
her
gratitude
but
fortunately
she
soon
released
him
turn
Sirius
and
thank
him
for
looking
after
her
children
through
the
night
Sirius
said
was
very
pleased
have
been
able
help
and
hoped
they
would
all
stay
with
him
long
Weasley

Sirius
grateful
they
think
there
little
while
and
would
wonderful
nearer

might
mean
here
for
Christmas
The
more

merrier
said
Sirius
with
such
obvious
sincerity
that
Mrs
Weasley
beamed
him
threw
apron
and
began
help
with
breakfast
Sirius
Harry
muttered
unable
stand
moment
longer
Can
have
quick
word
now
walked
into
the
dark
pantry
and
Sirius
followed
Without
preamble
Harry
told
his
godfather
every
detail
the
vision
had
had
including
the
fact
that
himself
had
been
the
snake
who
had
attacked
Weasley
When
paused
for
breath
Sirius
said
Did
you
tell
Dumbledore
this
Yes
said
Harry
impatiently
but
didn
tell
what
meant
Well

more

have
told
you

about
said
Sirius
steadily
But

aftermath

Sirius
You

said
Harry

his
head

You

said
Sirius
firmly
You
going
have
breakfast
then
upstairs
bed
and
after
lunch
you
can
and
see
Arthur
with
the
others
You
shock
Harry
you
blaming
yourself
for
something
you
only
witnessed
and
lucky
youdid
witness
Arthur
might
have
died
Just
stop
worrying
clapped
Harry
the
shoulder
and
left
the
pantry
leaving
Harry
standing
alone
the
dark
Everyone
but
Harry
spent
the
rest
the
morning
sleeping
went
the
bedroom
and
Ron
had
shared
over
the
last
few
weeks
summer
but
while
Ron
crawled
into
bed
and
was
asleep
within
minutes
Harry
sat
fully
clothed
hunched
against
the
cold
metal
bars
the
bedstead
keeping
himself
deliberately
uncomfortable
determined
not
fall
into
doze
terrified
that
might
become
the
serpent
again
his
sleep
and
wake
find
that
had
attacked
Ron
else
slithered
through
the
house
after
one
the
others
When
Ron
woke
Harry
pretended
have
enjoyed
refreshing
nap
too
Their
trunks
arrived
from
Hogwarts
while
they
were
eating
lunch
they
could
dress
Muggles
for
the
trip
Mungo
Everybody
except
Harry
was
riotously
happy
and
talkative
they
changed
out
their
robes
into
jeans
and
sweatshirts
When
Tonks
and
Mad
Eye
turned
escort
them
across
London
they
greeted
them
gleefully
laughing
the
bowler
hat
Mad
Eye
was
wearing
angle
conceal
his
magicaleye
and
assuring
him
truthfully
that
Tonks
whose
hair
was
short
and
bright
pink
again
would
attract
far
less
attention
the
Underground
Tonks
was
very
interested
Harry
vision
the
attack
Weasley
something
Harry
was
not
remotely
interested
discussing
There
isn
any
Seer

family
there
she
enquired
curiously
they
sat
side
side
train
rattling
towards
the
heart
the
city
said
Harry
thinking
Professor
Trelawney
and
feeling
insulted
said
Tonks
musingly
suppose
not
really
prophecy
you
doing
mean
you
not
seeing
the
future
you
seeing
the
present
odd
isn
Useful
though
Harry
didn
answer
fortunately
they
got
out
the
next
stop
station
the
very
heart
London
and
the
bustle
leaving
the
train
was
able
allow
Fred
and
George
get
between
himself
and
Tonks
who
was
leading
the
way
They
all
followedher
the
escalator
Moody
clunking
along
the
back
the
group
his
bowler
tilted
low
and
one
gnarled
hand
stuck
between
the
buttons
his
coat
clutching
his
wand
Harry
thought
sensed
the
concealed
eye
staring
hard
him
Trying
avoid
any
more
questions
about
his
dream
asked
Mad
Eye
where
Mungo
was
hidden
Not
far
from
here
grunted
Moody
they
stepped
out
into
the
wintry
air
broad
store
lined
street
packed
with
Christmas
shoppers
pushed
Harry
little
ahead
him
and
stumped
along
just
behind
Harry
knew
the
eye
was
rolling
all
directions
under
the
tilted
hat
Wasn
easy
find
good
location
for
hospital
Nowhere
Diagon
Alley
was
big
enough
and
couldn
have
underground
like
the
Ministry
wouldn
healthy
the
end
they
managed
get
hold
building
here
Theory
was
sick
wizards
could
come
and
and
just
blend
with
the
crowd
seized
Harry
shoulder
prevent
them
being
separated
gaggle
shoppers
plainly
intent
nothing
but
making
into
nearby
shop
full
electrical
gadgets
Here
said
Moody
moment
later
They
had
arrived
outside
large
old
fashioned
red
brick
department
store
called
Purge
Dowse
Ltd
The
place
had
shabby
miserable
air
the
window
displays
consisted
few
chipped
dummies
with
their
wigs
askew
standing
random
and
modelling
fashions
least
ten
years
out
date
Large
signs
all
the
dusty
doors
read
Closed
for
Refurbishment
Harry
distinctly
heard
large
woman
laden
with
plastic
shopping
bags
say
her
friend
they
passed
never
open
that
place
Right
said
Tonks
beckoning
them
towards
window
displaying
nothing
but
particularly
ugly
female
dummy
Its
false
eyelashes
were
hanging
off
and
was
modelling
green
nylon
pinafore
dress
Everybody
ready
They
nodded
clustering
around
her
Moody
gave
Harry
another
shove
between
the
shoulder
blades
urge
him
forward
and
Tonks
leaned
close
the
glass
looking
the
very
ugly
dummy
her
breath
steaming
the
glass
Wotcher
she
said
here
see
Arthur
Weasley
Harry
thought
how
absurd
was
for
Tonks
expect
the
dummy
hear
her
talking
quietly
through
sheet
glass
with
buses
rumbling
along
behind
her
and
all
the
racket
street
full
shoppers
Then
reminded
himself
that
dummies
couldn
hear
anyway
Next
second
his
mouth
opened
shock
the
dummy
gave
tiny
nod
and
beckoned
with
its
jointed
finger
and
Tonks
had
seized
Ginny
and
Mrs
Weasley
the
elbows
stepped
right
through
the
glass
and
vanished
Fred
George
and
Ron
stepped
after
them
Harry
glanced
around
the
jostling
crowd
not
one
them
seemed
have
glance
spare
for
window
displays
ugly
those
Purge
Dowse
Ltd
nor
did
any
them
seem
have
noticed
that
six
people
had
just
melted
into
thin
air
front
them
mon
growled
Moody
giving
Harry
yet
another
poke
the
back
and
together
they
stepped
forward
through
what
felt
like
sheet
cool
water
emerging
quite
warm
and
dry
the
other
side
There
was
sign
the
ugly
dummy
the
space
where
she
had
stood
They
were
what
seemed
crowded
reception
area
where
rows
witches
and
wizards
sat
upon
rickety
wooden
chairs
some
looking
perfectly
normal
and
perusing
out
date
copies
ofWitch
Weekly
others
sporting
gruesome
disfigurements
such
elephant
trunks
extra
hands
sticking
out
their
chests
The
room
was
scarcely
less
quiet
than
the
street
outside
for
many
the
patients
were
making
very
peculiar
noises
sweaty
faced
witch
the
centre
the
front
row
who
was
fanning
herself
vigorously
with
copy
theDaily
Prophet
kept
letting
off
high
pitched
whistle
steam
came
pouring
out
her
mouth
grubby
looking
warlock
the
corner
clanged
like
bell
every
time
moved
and
with
each
clang
his
head
vibrated
horribly
that
had
seize
himself
the
ears
hold
steady
Witches
and
wizards
lime
green
robes
were
walking
and
down
the
rows
asking
questions
and
making
notes
clipboards
like
Umbridge
Harry
noticed
the
emblem
embroidered
their
chests
wand
and
bone
crossed
Are
they
doctors
asked
Ron
quietly
Doctors
said
Ron
looking
startled
Those
Muggle
nutters
that
cut
people
Nah
they
Healers
Over
here
called
Mrs
Weasley
above
the
renewed
clanging
the
warlock
the
corner
and
they
followed
her
the
queue
front
plump
blonde
witch
seated

markedEnquiries
The
wall
behind
her
was
covered
notices
and
posters
saying

Dilys
was
eyeing
the
Weasley
party
closely
though
counting
them
when
Harry
caught
her
eye
she
gave
tiny
wink
walked
sideways
out
her
portrait
and
vanished
Meanwhile
the
front
the
queue
young
wizard
was
performing
odd
the

and
trying

his

Next
the

hobbled
and
pranced
sideways
out

the

moved
forward

Next
harassed
looking

was
holding
his
small

tightly
the
ankle
while
she
flapped
around

her

the

bored
voice
without

and
the
man
disappeared
through
the
double
doors
beside
the
desk
holding
his
daughter
like
oddly
shaped
balloon
Next
Mrs
Weasley
moved
forward
the
desk
Hello

Arthur

said
Mrs

Come

They
followed
her
through
the
double
doors
and
along
the
narrow
corridor
beyond
which
was
lined
with
more
portraits
famous
Healers
and
lit
crystal
bubbles
full
candles
that
floated
the
ceiling
looking
like
giant
soapsuds
More
witches
and
wizards
lime
green
robes
walked
and
out
the
doors
they
passed
foul
smelling
yellow
gas
wafted
into
the
passageway
they
passed
one
door
and
every
now
and
then
they
heard
distant
wailing
They
climbed
flight
stairs
and
entered
the

where
the
second

bore

said
Arthur

many
visitors

just

Mad
Eye
growled
his
approval
this
idea
and
set
himself
with
his
back
against
the
corridor
wall
his
magical
eye
spinning
all
directions
Harry
drew
back
too
but
Mrs
Weasley
reached
out
hand
and
pushed
him
through
the
door
saying
Don
silly
Harry
Arthur
wants
thank
you
The
ward
was
small
and
rather
dingy
the
only
window
was
narrow
and
set
high
the
wall
facing
the
door
Most
the
light
came
from
more
shining
crystal
bubbles
clustered
the
middle
the
ceiling
The
walls
were
panelled
oak
and
there
was
portrait
rather
vicious
looking
wizard
the
wall
captioned

Entrail

Curse
There
were
only
three
patients
Weasley
was
occupying
the
bed
the
far
end
the
ward
beside
the
tiny
window
Harry
was
pleased
and
relieved
see
that
was
propped
several
pillows
and
reading
theDaily
Prophet
the
solitary
ray
sunlight
falling
his
bed
looked
they
walked
towards
him
and
seeing
who
was
beamed
Hello

throwing

aside
Bill

Molly
had
get

but
says

later
How

Arthur
asked
Mrs
Weasley
bending
down
kiss
his
cheek
and
looking
anxiously
into
his
face
You
still
looking
bit
peaky
feel
absolutely
fine
said
Weasley
brightly
holding
out
his
good
arm
give
Ginny
hug
they
could
only
take
the
bandages
off
fit
home
Why
can
they
take
them
off
Dad
asked
Fred
Well
start
bleeding
like
mad
every
time
they
try
said
Weasley
cheerfully
reaching
across
for
his
wand
which
lay
his
bedside
cabinet
and
waving
that
six
extra
chairs
appeared
his
bedside
seat
them
all
seems
there
was
some
rather
unusual
kind
poison
that
snake
fangs
that
keeps
wounds
open
They
sure
they
find
antidote
though
they
say
they
had
much
worse
cases
than
mine
and
the
meantime
just
have
keep
taking
Blood
Replenishing
Potion
every
hour
But
that
fellow
over
there
said
dropping
his
voice
and
nodding
towards
the
bed
opposite
which
man
lay
looking
green
and
sickly
and
staring
the
ceiling
Bitten

whispered
Mrs

looking

Weasley
reminded
her
quietly
They

easy

What

asked
George
Said

bite

shut
said
Weasley
sadly
And
that
woman
overthere
indicated
the
only
other
occupied
bed
which
was
right
beside
the
door
won
tell
the
Healers
what
bit
her
which
makes
all
think
must
have
been
something
she
was
handling
illegally
Whatever
was
took
real
chunk
out
her
leg
very
nasty
smell
when
they
take
off
the
dressings
you
going
tell
what

Dad
asked
Fred
pulling
his
chair
closer
the
bed
Well

said
Weasley
with
significant
smile
Harry
very
simple
had
very
long
day
dozed
off
got
sneaked
and
bitten
theProphet
you
being
attacked
asked
Fred
indicating
the
newspaper
Weasley

Weasley
with
slightly
bitter
smile
the
Ministry
wouldn
want
everyone
know
dirty
great
serpent

Arthur
Mrs
Weasley
warned
him

Weasley
said
hastily
though
Harry
was
quite
sure
that
was
not
what
had
meant
say
where
were
you
when
happened
Dad
asked
George
That
business
said
Weasley
though
with
small
smile
snatched
theDaily
Prophet
shook
open
again
and
said
was
just
reading
about
Willy
Widdershins
arrest
when
you
arrived
You
know
Willy
turned
out
behind
those
regurgitating
toilets
back
the
summer
One
his
jinxes
backfired
the
toilet
exploded
and
they
found
him
lying
unconscious
the
wreckage
covered
from
head
foot
When
you
say
you
were
duty
Fred
interrupted
low
voice
what
were
you
doing
You
heard
your
father
whispered
Mrs
Weasley

here
about
Willy
Widdershins
Arthur
Well

Weasley
grimly

said
George
quietly
The

The

You

snapped
Mrs
Weasley
Anyway

Weasley
raised
voice
this
time
Willy

Muggles

because
according

Mungo
for
emergency
bone
growth
and
memory
modification
Just
think
Muggles
Mungo
wonder
which
ward

And
looked
eagerly
around
though
hoping
see
signpost
Didn
you
say
You
Know
Who
got

Harry
asked
Fred
looking
his
father
for
reaction
massive
one
You

you
That

said
Mrs
Weasley
crossly

And

she
added
her
children
and
Harry
You

afterwards
They
trooped
back
into
the
corridor
Mad
Eye
and
Tonks
went
and
closed
the
door
the
ward
behind
them
Fred
raised
his
eyebrows
Fine
said
coolly
rummaging
his
pockets
like
that
Don

Looking

said
George
holding
out
what
looked
like
tangle
flesh
coloured
string
You

said
Fred
grinning
Let

Mungo
puts
Imperturbable
Charms

and
George
disentangled
the
string
and
separated
five
Extendable

Fred
and
George
handed
them
around
Harry
hesitated

Grinning

Harry
took
the
end
the
string
and
inserted
into
his
ear
the
twins
had
done
Fred
whispered
The
flesh
coloured
strings
wriggled
like
long
skinny
worms
and
snaked
under
the
door
first
Harry
could
hear
nothing
then
jumped
heard
Tonks
whispering
clearly
though
she
were
standing
right
beside
him
they
searched
the
whole
area

She

rather
uneasy
You

Moody

Obviously
Potter
doesn
realise
what
that
means
but
You
Know
Who
possessing
him
Harry
pulled
the
Extendable
Ear
out
his
own
his
heart
hammering
very
fast
and
heat
rushing
his
face
looked
around
the
others
They
were
all
staring
him
the
strings
still
trailing
from
their
ears
looking
suddenly
fearful
CHRISTMAS
THE
CLOSED
WARD
Was
this
why
Dumbledore
would
longer
meet
Harry
eyes
Did
expect
see
Voldemort
staring
out
them
afraid
perhaps
that
their
vivid
green
might
turn
suddenly
scarlet
with
catlike
slits
for
pupils
Harry
remembered
how
the
snakelike
face
Voldemort
had
once
forced
itself
out
the
back
Professor
Quirrell
head
and
ran
his
hand
over
the
back
his
own
wondering
what
would
feel
like
Voldemort
burst
out
his
skull
felt
dirty
contaminated
though
were
carrying
some
deadly
germ
unworthy
sit
the
Underground
train
back
from
the
hospital
with
innocent
clean
people
whose
minds
and
bodies
were
free
the
taint
Voldemort
had
not
merely
seen
the
snake
hadbeen
the
snake
knew
now
truly
terrible
thought
then
occurred
him
memory
bobbing
the
surface
his
mind
one
that
made
his
insides
writhe
and
squirm
like
serpents
What
after
apart
from
followers
Stuff
can
only
get
stealth
like
weapon
Something
didn
have
last
time
the
weapon
Harry
thought
and
was
though
poison
were
pumping
through
his
veins
chilling
him
bringing
him
out
sweat
swayed
with
the
train
through
the
dark
tunnel
the
one
Voldemort
trying
use
that
why
they
got
guards
around
everywhere
not
for
protection
for
other
people
only
not
working
they
can
have
someone
all
the
time
Hogwarts
did
attack
Weasley
last
night
was
Voldemort
made
and
could
inside
listening
thoughts
right
now
Are
you
all
right
Harry
dear
whispered
Mrs
Weasley
leaning
across
Ginny
speak
him
the
train
rattled
along
through
its
dark
tunnel
You
don
look
very
well
Are
you
feeling
sick
They
were
all
watching
him
shook
his
head
violently
and
stared
advertisement
for
home
insurance
Harry
dear
are
yousure
you
all
right
said
Mrs
Weasley
worried
voice
they
walked
around
the
unkempt
patch
grass
the
middle
Grimmauld
Place
You
look
ever
pale
are
you
sure
you
slept
this
morning
You
upstairs
bed
right
now
and
you
can
have
couple
hours
sleep
before
dinner
all
right
nodded
here
was
ready
made
excuse
not
talk
any
the
others
which
was
precisely
what
wanted
when
she
opened
the
front
door
hurried
straight
past
the
troll
leg
umbrella
stand
the
stairs
and
into
his
and
Ron
bedroom
Here
began
pace
and
down
past
the
two
beds
and
Phineas
Nigellus
empty
picture
frame
his
brain
teeming
and
seething
with
questions
and
ever
more
dreadful
ideas
How
had
become
snake
Perhaps
was
Animagus
couldn
would
know
perhapsVoldemort
was
Animagus
yes
thought
Harry
that
would
fit
hewould
turn
into
snake
course
and
when
possessing
then
both
transform
that
still
doesn
explain
how
got
London
and
back
bed
the
space
about
five
minutes
but
then
Voldemort
about
the
most
powerful
wizard
the
world
apart
from
Dumbledore
probably
problem
all
him
transport
people
like
that
And
then
with
terrible
stab
panic
thought
but
this
insane
Voldemort
possessing
giving
him
dear
view
into
the
Headquarters
the
Order
the
Phoenix
right
now
know
who
the
Order
and
where
Sirius
and
heard
loads
stuff
shouldn
have
everything
Sirius
told
the
first
night
was
here
There
was
only
one
thing
for
would
have
leave
Grimmauld
Place
straightaway
would
spend
Christmas
Hogwarts
without
the
others
which
would
keep
them
safe
over
the
holidays
least
but
that
wouldn
there
were
still
plenty
people
Hogwarts
maim
and
injure
What
was
Seamus
Dean
Neville
next
time
stopped
his
pacing
and
stood
staring
Phineas
Nigellus
empty
frame
leaden
sensation
was
settling
the
pit
his
stomach
had
alternative
was
going
have
return
Privet
Drive
cut
himself
off
from
other
wizards
entirely
Well
had
thought
there
was
point
hanging
around
Trying
with
all
his
might
not
think
how
the
Dursleys
were
going
react
when
they
found
him
their
doorstep
six
months
earlier
than
they
had
expected
strode
over
his
trunk
slammed
the
lid
shut
and
locked
then
glanced
around
automatically
for
Hedwig
before
remembering
that
she
was
still
Hogwarts
well
her
cage
would
one
less
thing
carry
seized
one
end
his
trunk
and
had
dragged
halfway
towards
the
door
when
snide
voice
said
Running
away
are
looked
around
Phineas
Nigellus
had
appeared
the
canvas
his
portrait
and
was
leaning
against
the
frame
watching
Harry
with
amused
expression
his
face
Not
running
away
said
Harry
shortly
dragging
his
trunk
few
more
feet
across
the
room
thought
said
Phineas
Nigellus
stroking
his
pointed
beard
that
belong
Gryffindor
house
you
were
supposed
brave
looks
though
you
would
have
been
better
off
own
house
Slytherins
are
brave
yes
but
not
stupid
For
instance
given
the
choice
will
always
choose
save
our
own
necks
not
own
neck
saving
said
Harry
tersely
tugging
the
trunk
over
patch
particularly
uneven
moth
eaten
carpet
right
front
the
door
see
said
Phineas
Nigellus
still
stroking
his
beard
this
cowardly
flight
you
are
beingnoble
Harry
ignored
him
His
hand
was
the
doorknob
when
Phineas
Nigellus
said
lazily
have
message
for
you
from
Albus
Dumbledore
Harry
span
round
What
Stay
where
you
are
haven
moved
said
Harry
his
hand
still
upon
the
doorknob
what
the
message
have
just
given
you
dolt
said
Phineas
Nigellus
smoothly
Dumbledore
says
Stay
where
you
are
Why
said
Harry
eagerly
dropping
the
end
his
trunk
Why
does
want
stay
What
else
did
say
Nothing
whatsoever
said
Phineas
Nigellus
raising
thin
black
eyebrow
though
found
Harry
impertinent
Harry
temper
rose
the
surface
like
snake
rearing
from
long
grass
was
exhausted
was
confused
beyond
measure
had
experienced
terror
relief
then
terror
again
the
last
twelve
hours
and
still
Dumbledore
did
not
want
talk
him
that
said
loudly
Stay
where
you
are
That
all
anyone
could
tell
after
got
attacked
those
Dementors
too
Just
stay
put
while
the
grown
ups
sort
out
Harry
won
bother
telling
you
anything
though
because
your
tiny
little
brain
might
not
able
cope
with
You
know
said
Phineas
Nigellus
even
more
loudly
than
Harry
this
precisely
why
Iloathed
being
teacher
Young
people
are
infernally
convinced
that
they
are
absolutely
right
about
everything
Has
not
occurred
you
poor
puffed
popinjay
that
there
might
excellent
reason
why
the
Headmaster
Hogwarts
not
confiding
every
tiny
detail
his
plans
you
Have
you
never
paused
while
feeling
hard
done
note
that
following
Dumbledore
orders
has
never
yet
led
you
into
harm
like
all
young
people
you
are
quite
sure
that
you
alone
feel
and
think
you
alone
recognise
danger
you
alone
are
the
only
one
clever
enough
realise
what
the
Dark
Lord
may
planning
planning
something
with
then
said
Harry
swiftly
Did
say
that
said
Phineas
Nigellus
idly
examining
his
silk
gloves
Now
you
will
excuse
have
better
things
than
listen
adolescent
agonising
good
day
you
And
strolled
the
edge
his
frame
and
out
sight
Fine
then
Harry
bellowed
the
empty
frame
And
tell
Dumbledore
thanks
for
nothing
The
empty
canvas
remained
silent
Fuming
Harry
dragged
his
trunk
back
the
foot
his
bed
then
threw
himself
face
down
the
moth
eaten
covers
his
eyes
shut
his
body
heavy
and
aching
felt
though
had
journeyed
for
miles
and
miles
seemed
impossible
that
less
than
twenty
four
hours
ago
Cho
Chang
had
been
approaching
him
under
the
mistletoe
was
tired
was
scared
sleep
yet
did
not
know
how
long
could
fight
Dumbledore
had
told
him
stay
that
must
mean
was
allowed
sleep
but
was
scared
what
happened
again
was
sinking
into
shadows
was
though
film
his
head
had
been
waiting
start
was
walking
down
deserted
corridor
towards
plain
black
door
past
rough
stone
walls
torches
and
open
doorway
flight
stone
steps
leading
downstairs
the
left
reached
the
black
door
but
could
not
open
stood
gazing
desperate
for
entry
something
wanted
with
all
his
heart
lay
beyond
prize
beyond
his
dreams
only
his
scar
would
stop
prickling
then
would
able
think
more
clearly
Harry
said
Ron
voice
from
far
far
away
Mum
says
dinner
ready
but
she
save
you
something
you
want
stay
bed
Harry
opened
his
eyes
but
Ron
had
already
left
the
room
doesn
want
his
own
with
Harry
thought
Not
after
what
heard
Moody
say
supposed
none
them
would
want
him
there
any
more
now
that
they
knew
what
was
inside
him
would
not
down
dinner
would
not
inflict
his
company
them
turned
over
his
other
side
and
after
while
dropped
back
off
sleep
woke
much
later
the
early
hours
the
morning
his
insides
aching
with
hunger
and
Ron
snoring
the
next
bed
Squinting
around
the
room
saw
the
dark
outline
Phineas
Nigellus
standing
again
his
portrait
and
occurred
Harry
that
Dumbledore
had
probably
sent
Phineas
Nigellus
watch
over
him
case
attacked
somebody
else
The
feeling
being
unclean
intensified
half
wished
had
not
obeyed
Dumbledore
thiswas
how
life
was
going
for
him
Grimmauld
Place
from
now
maybe
would
better
off
Privet
Drive
after
all
Everybody
else
spent
the
following
morning
putting
Christmas
decorations
Harry
could
not
remember
Sirius
ever
being
such
good
mood
was
actually
singing
carols
apparently
delighted
that
was
have
company
over
Christmas
Harry
could
hear
his
voice
echoing
through
the
floor
the
cold
drawing
room
where
was
sitting
alone
watching
the
sky
growing
whiter
outside
the
windows
threatening
snow
all
the
time
feeling
savage
pleasure
that
was
giving
the
others
the
opportunity
keep
talking
about
him
they
were
bound
doing
When
heard
Mrs
Weasley
calling
his
name
softly
the
stairs
around
lunchtime
retreated
further
upstairs
and
ignored
her
Around
six
clock
the
evening
the
doorbell
rang
and
Mrs
Black
started
screaming
again
Assuming
that
Mundungus
some
other
Order
member
had
come
call
Harry
merely
settled
himself
more
comfortably
against
the
wall
Buckbeak
room
where
was
hiding
trying
ignore
how
hungry
felt
fed
dead
rats
the
Hippogriff
came
slight
shock
when
somebody
hammered
hard
the
door
few
minutes
later
know
you
there
said
Hermione
voice
Will
you
please
come
out
want
talk
you
What
areyou
doing
here
Harry
asked
her
pulling
open
the
door
Buckbeak
resumed
his
scratching
the
straw
strewn
floor
for
any
fragments
rat
may
have
dropped
thought
you
were
skiing
with
your
mum
and
dad
Well
tell
the
truth
skiing
not
really
thing
said
Hermione
come
here
for
Christmas
There
was
snow
her
hair
and
her
face
was
pink
with
cold
But
don
tell
Ron
told
him
skiing
sreally
good
because
kept
laughing
much
Mum
and
Dad
are
bit
disappointed
but
told
them
that
everyone
who
serious
about
the
exams
staying
Hogwarts
study
They
want
well
they
understand
Anyway
she
said
briskly
let
your
bedroom
Ron
mum
has
lit
fire
there
and
she
sent
sandwiches
Harry
followed
her
back
the
second
floor
When
entered
the
bedroom
was
rather
surprised
see
both
Ron
and
Ginny
waiting
for
them
sitting
Ron
bed
came
the
Knight
Bus
said
Hermione
airily
pulling
off
her
jacket
before
Harry
had
time
speak
Dumbledore
told
what
had
happened
first
thing
this
morning
but
had
wait
for
term
end
officially
before
setting
off
Umbridge
already
livid
that
you
lot
disappeared
right
under
her
nose
even
though
Dumbledore
told
her
Weasley
was
Mungo
and
given
you
all
permission
visit
She
sat
down
next
Ginny
and
the
two
girls
and
Ron
all
looked
Harry
How
you
feeling
asked
Hermione
Fine
said
Harry
stiffly
don
lie
Harry
she
said
impatiently
Ron
and
Ginny
say
you
been
hiding
from
everyone
since
you
got
back
from
Mungo
They
they
said
Harry
glaring
Ron
and
Ginny
Ron
looked
down
his
feet
but
Ginny
seemed
quite
unabashed
Well
you
have
she
said
And
you
won
look
any
you
lot
who
won
look
said
Harry
angrily
Maybe
you
taking
turns
look
and
keep
missing
each
other
suggested
Hermione
the
corners
her
mouth
twitching
Very
funny
snapped
Harry
turning
away
stop
feeling
all
misunderstood
said
Hermione
sharply
Look
the
others
have
told
what
you
overheard
last
night
the
Extendable
Ears
Yeah
growled
Harry
his
hands
deep
his
pockets
watched
the
snow
now
falling
thickly
outside
All
been
talking
about
have
you
Well
getting
used
wanted
talkto
you
Harry
said
Ginny
but
you
been
hiding
ever
since
got
back
didn
want
anyone
talk
said
Harry
who
was
feeling
more
and
more
nettled
Well
that
was
bit
stupid
you
said
Ginny
angrily
seeing
you
don
know
anyone
but
who
been
possessed
You
Know
Who
and
can
tell
you
how
feels
Harry
remained
quite
still
the
impact
these
words
hit
him
Then
wheeled
round
forgot
said
Lucky
you
said
Ginny
coolly
sorry
Harry
said
and
meant
you
think
being
possessed
then
Well
can
you
remember
everything
you
been
doing
Ginny
asked
Are
there
big
blank
periods
where
you
don
know
what
you
been
Harry
racked
his
brains
said
Then
You
Know
Who
hasn
ever
possessed
you
said
Ginny
simply
When
did
couldn
remember
what
been
doing
for
hours
time
find
myself
somewhere
and
not
know
how
got
there
Harry
hardly
dared
believe
her
yet
his
heart
was
lightening
almost
spite
himself
That
dream
had
about
your
dad
and
the
snake
though
Harry
you
had
these
dreams
before
Hermione
said
You
had
flashes
what
Voldemort
was
last
year
This
was
different
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
wasinside
that
snake
was
like
Iwas
the
snake
what
Voldemort
somehow
transported
London
One
day
said
Hermione
sounding
thoroughly
exasperated
you
readHogwarts
History
and
perhaps
will
remind
you
that
you
can
Apparate
Disapparate
inside
Hogwarts
Even
Voldemort
couldn
just
make
you
fly
out
your
dormitory
Harry
You
didn
leave
your
bed
mate
said
Ron
saw
you
thrashing
around
your
sleep
for
least
minute
before
could
wake
you
Harry
started
pacing
and
down
the
room
again
thinking
What
they
were
all
saying
was
not
only
comforting
made
sense
without
really
thinking
took
sandwich
from
the
plate
the
bed
and
crammed
hungrily
into
his
mouth
not
the
weapon
after
all
thought
Harry
His
heart
swelled
with
happiness
and
relief
and
felt
like
joining
they
heard
Sirius
tramping
past
their
door
towards
Buckbeak
room
singing
God
Rest
Merry
Hippogriffs
the
top
his
voice
How
could
have
dreamed
returning
Privet
Drive
for
Christmas
Sirius
delight
having
the
house
full
again
and
especially
having
Harry
back
was
infectious
was
longer
their
sullen
host
the
summer
now
seemed
determined
that
everyone
should
enjoy
themselves
much
not
more
than
they
would
have
done
Hogwarts
and
worked
tirelessly
the
run
Christmas
Day
cleaning
and
decorating
with
their
help
that
the
time
they
all
went
bed
Christmas
Eve
the
house
was
barely
recognisable
The
tarnished
chandeliers
were
longer
hung
with
cobwebs
but
with
garlands
holly
and
gold
and
silver
streamers
magical
snow
glittered
heaps
over
the
threadbare
carpets
great
Christmas
tree
obtained
Mundungus
and
decorated
with
live
fairies
blocked
Sirius
family
tree
from
view
and
even
the
stuffed
elf
heads
the
hall
wall
wore
Father
Christmas
hats
and
beards
Harry
awoke
Christmas
morning
find
stack
presents
the
foot
his
bed
and
Ron
already
halfway
through
opening
his
own
rather
larger
pile
Good
haul
this
year
informed
Harry
through
cloud
paper
Thanks
for
the
Broom
Compass
excellent
beats
Hermione
she
got
ahomework
planner
Harry
sorted
through
his
presents
and
found
one
with
Hermione
handwriting
She
had
given
him
too
book
that
resembled
diary
except
that
every
time
opened
page
said
aloud
things
like
today
later
you
pay
Sirius
and
Lupin
had
given
Harry
set
excellent
books
entitledPractical
Defensive
Magic
and
its
Use
Against
the
Dark
Arts
which
had
superb
moving
colour
illustrations
all
the
counter
jinxes
and
hexes
described
Harry
flicked
through
the
first
volume
eagerly
could
see
was
going
highly
useful
his
plans
for
the
Hagrid
had
sent
furry
brown
wallet
that
had
fangs
which
were
presumably
supposed
anti
theft
device
but
unfortunately
prevented
Harry
putting
any
money
without
getting
his
fingers
ripped
off
Tonks
present
was
small
working
model
Firebolt
which
Harry
watched
fly
around
the
room
wishing
still
had
his
full
size
version
Ron
had
given
him
enormous
box
Every
Flavour
Beans
and
Mrs
Weasley
the
usual
hand
knitted
jumper
and
some
mince
pies
and
Dobby
truly
dreadful
painting
that
Harry
suspected
had
been
done
the
elf
himself
had
just
turned
upside
down
see
whether
looked
better
that
way
when
with

They
got
and
dressed
They
could
hear
the
various
inhabitants
the
house
calling
Merry

one
another
their
way
downstairs
they
met
Hermione

Harry

And

Ron

added
nodding
the
neatly
wrapped
present
she
was
carrying
Kreacher
said
Hermione
brightly
had
better
not

Ron
warned
her
You

Sirius
said
Kreacher

too
much

isn
clothes
said
Hermione
although
had
way
certainly
give
him
something
wear
other
than
that
filthy
old
rag
patchwork
quilt
thought
would
brighten
his

What
bedroom
said
Harry
dropping
his
voice
whisper
they
were
passing
the
portrait
Sirius

Well
Sirius
says
not
much
bedroom
more
kind
den
said
Hermione
Apparently
sleeps
under
the
boiler
that
cupboard
off
the
kitchen
Mrs
Weasley
was
the
only
person
the
basement
when
they
arrived
there
She
was
standing
the
stove
and
sounded
though
she
had
bad
head
cold
she
wished
them
Merry
Christmas
and
they
all
averted
their
eyes
this
Kreacher
bedroom
said
Ron
strolling
over
dingy
door
the
corner
opposite
the
pantry
Harry
had
never
seen
open
Yes
said
Hermione
now
sounding
little
nervous
think
better
knock
Ron
rapped
the
door
with
his
knuckles
but
there
was
reply
must
sneaking
around
upstairs
said
and
without
further
ado
pulled
open
the
door
Urgh
Harry
peered
inside
Most
the
cupboard
was
taken
with
very
large
and
old
fashioned
boiler
but
the
foot
space
underneath
the
pipes
Kreacher
had
made
himself
something
that
looked
like
nest
jumble
assorted
rags
and
smelly
old
blankets
were
piled
the
floor
and
the
small
dent
the
middle
showed
where
Kreacher
curled
sleep
every
night
Here
and
there
among
the
material
were
stale
bread
crusts
and
mouldy
old
bits
cheese
far
corner
glinted
small
objects
and
coins
that
Harry
guessed
Kreacher
had
saved
magpie
like
from
Sirius
purge
the
house
and
had
also
managed
retrieve
the
silver
framed
family
photographs
that
Sirius
had
thrown
away
over
the
summer
Their
glass
might
shattered
but
still
the
little
black
and
white
people
inside
them
peered
him
haughtily
including
felt
little
jolt
hisstomach
the
dark
heavy
lidded
woman
whose
trial
had
witnessed
Dumbledore
Pensieve
Bellatrix
Lestrange
the
looks
hers
was
Kreacher
favourite
photograph
had
placed
the
fore
all
the
others
and
had
mended
the
glass
clumsily
with
Spellotape
think
just
leave
his
present
here
said
Hermione
laying
the
package
neatly
the
middle
the
depression
the
rags
and
blankets
and
closing
the
door
quietly
find
later
that
fine
Come
think
said
Sirius
emerging
from
the
pantry
carrying
large
turkey
they
closed
the
cupboard
door
has
anyone
actually
seen
Kreacher
lately
haven
seen
him
since
the
night
came
back
here
said
Harry
You
were
ordering
him
out
the
kitchen
Yeah
said
Sirius
frowning
You
know
think
that
the
last
time
saw
him
too
must
hiding
upstairs
somewhere
couldn
have
left
could
said
Harry
mean
when
you
said
out
maybe
thought
you
meant
get
out
the
house
house
elves
can
leave
unless
they
given
clothes
They
tied
their
family
house
said
Sirius
They
can
leave
the
house
they
really
want
Harry
contradicted
him
Dobby
did
left
the
Malfoys
give
warnings
two
years
ago
had
punish
himself
afterwards
but
still
managed
Sirius
looked
slightly
disconcerted
for
moment
then
said
look
for
him
later
expect
find
him
upstairs
crying
his
eyes
out
over
mother
old
bloomers
something
course
might
have
crawled
into
the
airing
cupboard
and
died
but
mustn
get
hopes
Fred
George
and
Ron
laughed
Hermione
however
looked
reproachful
Once
they
had
eaten
their
Christmas
lunch
the
Weasleys
Harry
and
Hermione
were
planning
pay
Weasley
another
visit
escorted
Mad
Eye
and
Lupin
Mundungus
turned
time
for
Christmas
pudding
and
trifle
having
managed
borrow
car
for
the
occasion
the
Underground
did
not
run
Christmas
Day
The
car
which
Harry
doubted
very
much
had
been
taken
with
the
consent
its
owner
had
been
enlarged
with
spell
like
the
Weasleys
old
Ford
Anglia
had
once
been
Although
normally
proportioned
outside
ten
people
with
Mundungus
driving
were
able
fit
into
quite
comfortably
Mrs
Weasley
hesitated
before
getting
inside
Harry
knew
her
disapproval
Mundungus
was
battling
with
her
dislike
travelling
without
magic
but
finally
the
cold
outside
and
her
children
pleading
triumphed
and
she
settled
herself
into
the
back
seat
between
Fred
and
Bill
with
good
grace
The
journey
Mungo
was
quite
quick
there
was
very
little
traffic
the
roads
small
trickle
witches
and
wizards
was
creeping
furtively
the
otherwise
deserted
street
visit
the
hospital
Harry
and
the
others
got
out
the
car
and
Mundungus
drove
off
around
the
corner
wait
for
them
They
strolled
casually
towards
the
window
where
the
dummy
green
nylon
stood
then
one
one
stepped
through
the
glass
The
reception
area
looked
pleasantly
festive
the
crystal
orbs
that
illuminated
Mungo
had
been
coloured
red
and
gold
become
gigantic
glowing
Christmas
baubles
holly
hung
around
every
doorway
and
shining
white
Christmas
trees
covered
magical
snow
and
icicles
glittered
every
corner
each
one
topped
with
gleaming
gold
star
was
less
crowded
than
the
last
time
theyhad
been
there
although
halfway
across
the

Harry
found
himself
shunted
aside

They
found

propped

with
the

his
turkey

tray
his

and
rather
sheepish
expression
his
face
Everything
all
right
Arthur
asked
Mrs
Weasley
after
they
had
all
greeted
Weasley
and
handed
over
their
presents
Fine
fine
said
Weasley
little
too
heartily
You
haven

Healer
Smethwyck
have
you
said
Mrs
Weasley
suspiciously
why
Nothing
nothing
said
Weasley
airily
starting
unwrap
his

gifts
Well
everyone
had
good
day
What
did
you
all
get
for
Christmas
Harry
this
absolutelywonderful
For

Mrs

did
not

entirely
satisfied
with
Weasley
answer
her
husband
leaned
over

Harry

she
peered
the
bandaging
under
his

Arthur
she
said
with
snap
her
voice
like

you

your

changed
Why
have
you
had
your
bandages
changed

early
Arthur
They
told
they
wouldn
need
doing
until
tomorrow
What
said
Weasley
looking
rather
frightened
and
pulling
the
bed
covers
higher
his
chest
nothing
seemed
deflate
under
Mrs
Weasley
piercing
gaze
Well
now
don
get
upset
Molly
but
Augustus
Pye
had
idea
the
Trainee
Healer
you
know
lovely
young
chap
and
very
interested
complementary
medicine
mean
some
these
old
Muggle
remedies
well
they
called
stitches
Molly
and
they
work
very
well
Muggle
wounds
Mrs
Weasley
let
out
ominous
noise
somewhere
between
shriek
and
snarl
Lupin
strolled
away
from
the
bed
and
over
the
werewolf
who
had
visitors
and
was
looking
rather
wistfully
the
crowd
around
Weasley
Bill
muttered
something
about
getting
himself
cup
tea
and
Fred
and
George
leapt
accompany
him
grinning
you
mean
tell
said
Mrs
Weasley
her
voice
growing
louder
with
every
word
and
apparently
unaware
that
her
fellow
visitors
were
scurrying
for
cover
that
you
have
been
messing
about
with
Muggle
remedies
Not
messing
about
Molly
dear
said
Weasley
imploringly
was
just
just
something
Pye
and
thought
try
only
most
unfortunately
well
with
these
particular
kinds

doesn
seem

hoped
Meaning
Well

know
whether

what
stitches
are
sounds
though
you
been
trying
sew
your

said
Mrs
Weasley
with
snort
mirthless
laughter
but
even
you
Arthur
wouldn
bethat
stupid
fancy
cup

said
Harry
jumping
his
feet
Hermione
Ron
and
Ginny
almost
sprinted
the
door
with
him
swung
closed
behind
them
they
heard
Mrs
Weasley
shriek
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
THAT
THE
GENERAL
IDEA
Typical
Dad
said
Ginny
shaking
her
head
they
set
off
the
corridor
Stitches

you
Well

Hermione
fairly

Fifth

said
Harry
remembering
the
sign
over
the
welcomewitch
desk
They
walked
along
the
corridor
through
set
double
doors
and
found
rickety
staircase
lined
with
more
portraits
brutal
looking
Healers
they
climbed
the
various
Healers
called
out
them
diagnosing
odd
complaints
and
suggesting
horrible
remedies
Ron
was
seriously
affronted
when
medieval
wizard
called
out
that
clearly
had
bad
case
spattergroit
And
what
that
supposed
asked
angrily
the
Healer
pursued
him
through
six
more
portraits
shoving
the
occupants
out
the
way
Tis
most
grievous
affliction
the
skin
young
master
that
will
leave
you
pockmarked
and
more
gruesome
even
than
you
are
now
Watch

Ron
his

said
Ron
furiously
Now
get
back
your

and
leave

rounded
the
others
who
were
all
keeping
determinedly
straight
faces
What

Hermione
Nah

Harry
one
more
But
stepped

into

was
peering
out
them
all
with
his
nose
pressed
against
the
glass

wavy
blond
hair
bright
blue
eyes
and
broad
vacant
smile
that
revealed
dazzlingly
white
teeth
Blimey
said
Ron
also
staring
the
man
goodness
said
Hermione
suddenly
sounding
breathless
Professor
Lockhart
Their
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
pushed
open
the
doors
and
moved
towards
them
wearing
long
lilac
dressing
gown
Well
hello
there
said
expect
you
like
autograph
would
you
Hasn
changed
much
has
Harry
muttered
Ginny
who
grinned
how
are
you
Professor
said
Ron
sounding
slightly
guilty
had
been
Ron
malfunctioning
wand
that
had
damaged
Professor
Lockhart
memory
badly
that
had
landed
Mungo
the
first
place
though
Lockhart
had
been
attempting
permanently
wipe
Harry
and
Ron
smemories
the
time
Harry
sympathy
was
limited
very
well
indeed
thank
you
said
Lockhart
exuberantly
pulling
rather
battered
peacock
feather
quill
from
his
pocket
Now
how
many
autographs
would
you
like
can
joined
writing
now
you
know
don
want
any
the
moment
thanks
said
Ron
raising
his
eyebrows
Harry
who
asked
Professor
should
you
wandering
around
the
corridors
Shouldn
you
ward
The
smile
faded
slowly
from
Lockhart
face
For
few
moments
hegazed
intently
Harry
then
said
Haven
met
yeah
have
said
Harry
You
used
teach
Hogwarts
remember
Teach
repeated
Lockhart
looking
faintly
unsettled
Did
And
then
the
smile
reappeared
upon
his
face
suddenly
was
rather
alarming
Taught
you
everything
you
know
expect
did
Well
how
about
those
autographs
then
Shall
say
round
dozen
you
can
give
them
all
your
little
friends
then
and
nobody
will
left
out
But
just
then
head
poked
out
door
the
far
end
the
corridor
and
voice
called
Gilderoy
you
naughty
boy
where
have
you
wandered
off
motherly
looking
Healer
wearing
tinsel
wreath
her
hair
came
bustling
the
corridor
smiling
warmly
Harry
and
the
others
Gilderoy
you

Howlovely

Christmas

henever

Gilderoy
told
the
Healer
with
another
glittering
smile
They
want
loads
them
won
take
for
answer
just
hope
got
enough
photographs
Listen
him
said
the
Healer
taking
Lockhart
arm
and
beaming
fondly
him
though
were
precocious
two
year
old
was
rather
well
known
few
years
ago
very
much
hope
that
this
liking
for
giving
autographs
sign
that
his
memory
might
starting
come
back
Will

But

Ron
gesturing
uselessly
the
floor
above
actually
were
just
But
the
Healer
was
smiling
expectantly
them
and
Ron
feeble
mutter
going
have
cup
tea
trailed
away
into
nothingness
They
looked
each
other
helplessly
then
followed
Lockhart
and
his
Healer
along
the
corridor
Let
not
stay
long
Ron
said
quietly
The
Healer
pointed
her
wand
the
door
the
Janus
Thickey
Ward
and
muttered
Alohomora
The
door
swung
open
and
she
led
the
way
inside
keeping
firm
grasp
Gilderoy
arm
until
she
had
settled
him
into
armchair
beside
his
bed
This
our

ward
she
informed
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
low
voice
For
permanent
spell
damage
you
know
course
with
intensive
remedial
potions
and
charms
and
bit
luck
can
produce
some
improvement
Gilderoy
does
seem
getting
back
some
sense
himself
and
seen
real
improvement
Bode
seems
regaining
the
power
speech
very
well
though
isn
speaking
any
language
recognise
yet
Well
must
finish
giving
out
the
Christmas
presents
leave
you
all
chat
Harry
looked
around
The
ward
bore
unmistakeable
signs
being
permanent
home
its
residents
They
had
many
more
personal
effects
around
their
beds
than
Weasley
ward
the
wall
around
Gilderoy
headboard
for
instance
was
papered
with
pictures
himself
all
beaming
toothily
and
waving
the
new
arrivals
had
autographed
many
them
himself
disjointed
childish
writing
The
moment
had
been
deposited
his
chair
the
Healer
Gilderoy
pulled
fresh
stack
photographs
towards
him
seized
quill
and
started
signing
them
all
feverishly
You

Ginny

looking

mournful
looking
wizard
lay
the
bed
opposite
staring
the
ceiling
was
mumbling
himself
and
seemed
quite
unaware
anything
around
him
Two
beds
along
was
woman
whose
entire
head
was
covered
fur
Harry
remembered
something
similar
happening
Hermione
during
their
second
year
although
fortunately
the
damage
her
case
had
not
been
permanent
the
far
end
the
ward
flowery
curtains
had
been
drawn
around
two
beds
give
the
occupants
and
their
visitors
some
privacy
Here
you
are
Agnes
said
the
Healer
brightly
the
furry
faced
woman
handing
her
small
pile
Christmas
presents
See
not
forgotten
are
you
And
your

said
the

bustling
along
the
mumbling
man
setting
rather
ugly
plant
with
long
swaying
tentacles
the
bedside
cabinet
and
fixing
the
calendar
the
wall
with
her
wand
And
Mrs
Longbottom

leaving
already
Harry
head
span
round
The
curtains
had
been
drawn
back
from
the
two
beds
the
end
the
ward
and
two
visitors
were
walking
back
down
the
aisle
between
the
beds
formidable
looking
old
witch
wearing
long
green
dress
moth
eaten
fox
fur
and
pointed
hat
decorated
with
what
was
unmistakeablya
stuffed
vulture
and
trailing
behind
her
looking
thoroughly
depressed
Neville
With
sudden
rush
understanding
Harry
realised
who
the
people
the
end
beds
must
cast
around
wildly
for
some
means
distracting
the
others
that
Neville
could
leave
the
ward
unnoticed
and
unquestioned
but
Ron
had
also
looked
the
sound
the
name
Longbottom
and
before
Harry
could
stop
him
had
called
out
Neville
Neville
jumped
and
cowered
though
bullet
had
narrowly
missed
him
Neville
said
Ron
brightly
getting
his
feet
Have
you
seen
Lockhart
here
Who
you
been
visiting
Friends
yours
Neville
dear
said
Neville
grandmother
graciously
bearing
down
upon
them
all
Neville
looked
though
would
rather
anywhere
the
world
but
here
dull
purple
flush
was
creeping
his
plump
face
and
was
not
making
eye
contact
with
any
them
yes
said
his
grandmother
looking
closely
Harry
and
sticking
out
shrivelled
clawlike
hand
for
him
shake
Yes
yes
know
who
you
are
course
Neville
speaks
most
highly
you
thanks
said
Harry
shaking
hands
Neville
did
not
look
him
but
surveyed
his
own
feet
the
colour
deepening
his
face
all
the
while
And
you
two
are
clearly
Weasleys
Mrs
Longbottom
continued
proffering
her
hand
regally
Ron
and
Ginny
turn
Yes
know
your
parents
not
well
course
but
fine
people
fine
people
and
you
must
Hermione
Granger
Hermione
looked
rather
startled
that
Mrs
Longbottom
knew
her
name
but
shook
hands
all
the
same
Yes
Neville
told
all
about
you
Helped
him
out
few
sticky
spots
haven
you
good
boy
she
said
casting
sternly
appraising
look
down
her
rather
bony
nose
Neville
but
hasn
got
his
father
talent
afraid
say
And
she
jerked
her
head
the
direction
the
two
beds
the
end
the
ward
that
the
stuffed
vulture
her
hat
trembled
alarmingly
What
said
Ron
looking
amazed
Harry
wanted
stamp
Ron
foot
but
that
sort
thing
much
harder
bring
off
unnoticed
when
you
wearing
jeans
rather
than
robes
that
yourdad
down
the
end
Neville
What
this
said
Mrs
Longbottom
sharply
Haven
you
told
your
friends
about
your
parents
Neville
Neville
took
deep
breath
looked
the
ceiling
and
shook
his
head
Harry
could
not
remember
ever
feeling
sorrier
for
anyone
but
could
not
think
any
way
helping
Neville
out
the
situation
Well
nothing
ashamed
said
Mrs
Longbottom
angrily
You
should
beproud
Neville
proud
They
didn
give
their
health
and
their
sanity
their
only
son
would
ashamed
them
you
know
not
ashamed
said
Neville
very
faintly
still
looking
anywhere
but
Harry
and
the
others
Ron
was
now
standing
tiptoe
look
over
the
inhabitants
the
two
beds
Well
you
got
funny
way
showing
said
Mrs
Longbottom
son
and
his
wife
she
said
turning
haughtily
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
were
tortured
into
insanity
You
Know
Who
followers
Hermione
and
Ginny
both
clapped
their
hands
over
their
mouths
Ron
stopped
craning
his
neck
catch
glimpse
Neville
parents
and
looked
mortified
They
were
Aurors
you
know
and
very
well
respected
within
the
wizarding
community
Mrs
Longbottom
went
Highly
gifted
the
pair
them
yes
Alice
dear
what
Neville
mother
had
come
edging
down
the
ward
her
nightdress
She
longer
had
the
plump
happy
looking
face
Harry
had
seen
Moody
old
photograph
the
original
Order
the
Phoenix
Her
face
was
thin
and
worn
now
her
eyes
seemed
overlarge
and
her
hair
which
had
turned
white
was
wispy
anddead
looking
She
did
not
seem
want
speak
perhaps
she
was
not
able
but
she
made
timid
motions
towards
Neville
holding
something
her
outstretched
hand
Again
said
Mrs
Longbottom
sounding
slightly
weary
Very
well
Alice
dear
very
well
Neville
take
whatever
But
Neville
had
already
stretched
out
his
hand
into
which
his
mother
dropped
empty
Drooble
Best
Blowing
Gum
wrapper
Very
nice
dear
said
Neville
grandmother
falsely
cheery
voice
patting
his
mother
the
shoulder
But
Neville
said
quietly
Thanks
Mum
His
mother
tottered
away
back
the
ward
humming
herself
Neville
looked
around
the
others
his
expression
defiant
though
daring
them
laugh
but
Harry
did
not
think
ever
found
anything
less
funny
his
life
Well
better
get
back
sighed
Mrs
Longbottom
drawing
long
green
gloves
Very
nice
have
met
you
all
Neville
put
that
wrapper
the
bin
she
must
have
given
you
enough
them
paper
your
bedroom
now
But
they
left
Harry
was
sure
saw
Neville
slip
the
sweet
wrapper
into
his
pocket
The
door
closed
behind
them
never
knew
said
Hermione
who
looked
tearful
Nor
did
said
Ron
rather
hoarsely
Nor
whispered
Ginny
They
all
looked
Harry
did
said
glumly
Dumbledore
told
but
promised
wouldn
tell
anyone
that
what
Bellatrix
Lestrange
got
sent
Azkaban
for
using
the
Cruciatus
Curse
Neville
parents
until
they
lost
their
minds
Bellatrix
Lestrange
did
that
whispered
Hermione
horrified
That
woman
Kreacher
got
photo
his

There
was
long
silence

Lockharts
angry

Look

had
been
lurking
the
attic
Sirius
said
had
found
him
there
covered
dust
doubt
looking
for
more
relics
the
Black
family
hide
his
cupboard
Though
Sirius
seemed
satisfied
with
this
story
made
Harry
uneasy
Kreacher
seemed
better
mood
his
reappearance
his
bitter
muttering
had
subsided
somewhat
and
submitted
orders
more
docilely
than
usual
though
once
twice
Harry
caught
the
house
elf
staring
him
avidly
but
always
looking
quickly
away
whenever
saw
that
Harry
had
noticed
Harry
did
not
mention
his
vague
suspicions
Sirius
whose
cheerfulness
was
evaporating
fast
now
that
Christmas
was
over
the
date
their
departure
back
Hogwarts
drew
nearer
became
more
and
more
prone
what
Mrs
Weasley
called
fits
the
sullens
which
would
become
taciturn
and
grumpy
often
withdrawing
Buckbeak
room
for
hours
time
His
gloom
seeped
through
the
house
oozing
under
doorways
like
some
noxious
gas
that
all
them
became
infected
Harry
didn
want
leave
Sirius
again
with
only
Kreacher
for
company
fact
for
the
first
time
his
life
was
not
looking
forward
returning
Hogwarts
Going
back
school
would
mean
placing
himself
once
again
under
the
tyranny
Dolores
Umbridge
who
had
doubt
managed

through
another
dozen

their
absence
there
was

forward
now
that
had
been
banned
there
was
every
likelihood
that
their

would
increase

exams

even
nearer
and
Dumbledore
remained
remote
ever
fact
hadn
been
for
the
Harry
thought
might
have
begged
Sirius
let
him
leave
Hogwarts
and
remain
Grimmauld
Place
Then
the
very
last
day
the
holidays
something
happened
that
made
Harry
positively
dread
his
return
school
Harry
dear
said
Mrs
Weasley
poking
her
head
into
his
and
Ron
bedroom
where
the
pair
them
were
playing
wizard
chess
watched
Hermione
Ginny
and
Crookshanks
could
you
come
down
the
kitchen
Professor
Snape
would
like
word
with
you
Harry
did
not
immediately
register
what
she
had
said
one
his
castles
was
engaged
violent
tussle
with
pawn
Ron
and
was
egging
enthusiastically
Squash
him
squash
him
only
pawn
you
idiot
Sorry
Mrs
Weasley
what
did
you
say
Professor
Snape
dear
the
kitchen
like
word
Harry
mouth
fell
open
horror
looked
around
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
all
whom
were
gaping
back
him
Crookshanks
whom
Hermione
had
been
restraining
with
difficulty
for
the
past
quarter
hour
leapt
gleefully
the
board
and
set
the
pieces
running
for
cover
squealing
the
top
their
voices
Snape
said
Harry
blankly
Professor
Snape
dear
said
Mrs
Weasley
reprovingly
Now
come
quickly
says
can
stay
long
What
want
with
you
said
Ron
looking
unnerved
Mrs
Weasley
withdrew
from
the
room
You
haven
done
anything
have
you
said
Harry
indignantly
racking
his
brains
think
what
could
have
done
that
would
make
Snape
pursue
him
Grimmauld
Place
Had
his
last
piece
homework
perhaps
earned
minute
two
later
pushed
open
the
kitchen
door
find
Sirius
and
Snape
both
seated

The
silence
between

was

Harry

Snape
looked
around

Sirius
letting

Merely

they
had
all
agreed
that
Why

Snape
smoothly

Harry

Harry

Well

Harry

out
snarled
Sirius
pushing
him
aside
with
his
free
hand
The
kitchen
door
opened
and
the
entire
Weasley
family
plus
Hermione
came
inside
all
looking
very
happy
with
Weasley
walking
proudly
their

brightly
the

large
Completely

and
all
the
other
Weasleys
froze
the
threshold
gazing
the
scene
front
them
which
was
also
suspended
mid
action
both
Sirius
and
Snape
looking
towards
the
door
with
their
wands
pointing
into
each
other
faces
and
Harry
immobile
between
them

stretched
out

Both
Sirius
and
Snape
lowered
their

Harry
looked
from
one
the
other
Each
wore
expression
utmost
contempt
yet
the
unexpected
entrance
many
witnesses
seemed
have
brought
them
their
senses
Snape
pocketed
his
wand
turned
his
heel
and
swept
back
across
the
kitchen
passing
the
Weasleys
without
comment
the
door
looked
back
Six
clock
Monday

Potter
And
was
gone
Sirius
glared
after
him
his

his
side
What
been
going
asked
Weasley
again
Nothing
Arthur
said
Sirius
who
was
breathing
heavily
though
had
just
run
long
distance
Just
friendly
little
chat
between

old
school
friends
With

rather
menacingly
Yes
Molly

said
Weasley
meekly
That
night
meal
should
have
been
cheerful
one
with
Weasley
back
amongst
them
Harry
could
tell
Sirius
was
trying
make
yet
when
his
godfather
was
not
forcing
himself
laugh
loudly
Fred
and
George
jokes
offering
everyone
more
food
his
face
fell
back
into
moody
brooding
expression
Harry
was
separated
from
him
Mundungus
and
Mad
Eye
who
had
dropped
offer
Weasley
their
congratulations
wanted
talk
Sirius
tell
him
shouldn
listen
word
Snape
said
that
Snape
was
goading
him
deliberately
and
that
the
rest
them
didn
think
Sirius
was
coward
for
doing
Dumbledore
told
him
and
remaining
Grimmauld
Place
But
had
opportunity
and
eyeing
the
ugly
look
Sirius
face
Harry
wondered
occasionally
whether
would
have
dared
mention
even
had
the
chance
Instead
told
Ron
and
Hermione
under
his
voice
about
having
take
Occlumency
lessons
with
Snape
Dumbledore
wants
stop
you
having
those
dreams
about
Voldemort
said
Hermione
once
Well
you
won
sorry
not
have
them
any
more
will
you
Extra
lessons
with
Snape
said
Ron
sounding
aghast
rather
have
the
nightmares
They
were
return
Hogwarts
the
Knight
Bus
the
following
day
escorted
once
again
Tonks
and
Lupin
both
whom
were
eating
breakfast
the
kitchen
when
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
came
down
next
morning
The
adults
seemed
have
been
mid
way
through
whispered
conversation
Harry
opened
the
door
all
them
looked
round
hastily
and
fell
silent
After
hurried
breakfast
they
all
pulled
jackets
and
scarves
against
the
chilly
grey
January
morning
Harry
had
unpleasant
constricted
sensation
his
chest
did
not
want
say
goodbye
Sirius
had
bad
feeling
about
this
parting
didn
know
when
they
would
next
see
each
other
and
felt
was
incumbent
upon
him
say
something
Sirius
stop
him
doing
anything
stupid
Harry
was
worried
that
Snape
accusation
cowardice
had
stung
Sirius
badly
might
even
now
planning
some
foolhardy
trip
beyond
Grimmauld
Place
Before
could
think
what
say
however
Sirius
had
beckoned
him
his
side
want
you
take
this
said
quietly
thrusting
badly
wrapped
package
roughly
the
size
paperback
book
into
Harry
hands
What
Harry
asked
way
letting
know
Snape
giving
you
hard
time
don
open
here
said
Sirius
with
wary
look
Mrs
Weasley
who
was
trying
persuade
the
twins
wear
hand
knitted
mittens
doubt
Molly
would
approve
but
want
you
use
you
need
all
right
said
Harry
stowing
the
package
away
the
inside
pocket
his
jacket
but
knew
would
never
use
whatever
was
would
not
Harry
who
lured
Sirius
from
his
place
safety
matter
how
foully
Snape
treated
him
their
forthcoming
Occlumency
classes
Let
then
said
Sirius
clapping
Harry
the
shoulder
and
smiling
grimly
and
before
Harry
could
say
anything
else
they
were
heading
upstairs
stopping
before
the
heavily
chained
and
bolted
front
door
surrounded
Weasleys
Goodbye
Harry
take
care
said
Mrs
Weasley
hugging
him
See
you
Harry
and
keep
eye
out
for
snakes
for
said
Weasley
genially
shaking
his
hand
Right
yeah
said
Harry
distractedly
was
his
last
chance
tell
Sirius
careful
turned
looked
into
his
godfather
face
and
opened
his
mouth
speak
but
before
could
Sirius
was
giving
him
brief
one
armed
hug
and
saying
gruffly
Look
after
yourself
Harry
Next
moment
Harry
found
himself
being
shunted
out
into
the
icy
winter
air
with
Tonks
today
heavily
disguised
tall
tweedy
woman
with
iron
grey
hair
chivvying
him
down
the
steps
The
door
number
twelve
slammed
shut
behind
them
They
followed
Lupin
down
the
front
steps
reached
the
pavement
Harry
looked
round
Number
twelve
was
shrinking
rapidly
those
either
side
stretched
sideways
squeezing
out
sight
One
blink
later
had
gone
Come
the
quicker
get
the
bus
the
better
said
Tonks
and
Harry
thought
there
was
nervousness
the
glance
she
threw
around
the
square
Lupin
flung
out
his
right
arm
BANG
violently
purple
triple
decker
bus
had
appeared
out
thin
air
front
them
narrowly
avoiding
the
nearest
lamppost
which
jumped
backwards
out
its
way
thin
pimply
jug
eared
youth
purple
uniform
leapt
down
the
pavement
and
said
Welcome
the
Yes
yes
know
thank
you
said
Tonks
swiftly
get
And
she
shoved
Harry
forwards
towards
the
steps
past
the
conductor
who
goggled
Harry
passed
Ere
Arry
you
shout
his
name
will
curse
you
into
oblivion
muttered
Tonks
menacingly
now
shunting
Ginny
and
Hermione
forwards
always
wanted
this
thing
said
Ron
happily
joining
Harry
board
and
looking
around
had
been
evening
the
last
time
Harry
had
travelled
Knight
Bus
and
its
three
decks
had
been
full
brass
bedsteads
Now
the
early
morning
was
crammed
with
assortment
mismatched
chairs
grouped
haphazardly
around
windows
Some
these
appeared
have
fallen
over
when
the
bus
stopped
abruptly
Grimmauld
Place
few
witches
and
wizards
were
still
getting
their
feet
grumbling
and
somebody
shopping
bag
had
slid
the
length
the
bus
unpleasant
mixture
frogspawn
cockroaches
and
custard
creams
was
scattered
all
over
the
floor
Looks
like
have
split
said
Tonks
briskly
looking
around
for
empty
chairs
Fred
George
and
Ginny
you
just
take
those
seats
the
back
Remus
can
stay
with
you
She
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
proceeded
the
very
top
deck
where
there
were
two
unoccupied
chairs
the
very
front
the
bus
and
two
the
back
Stan
Shunpike
the
conductor
followed
Harry
and
Ron
eagerly
the
back
Heads
turned
Harry
passed
and
when
sat
down
saw
all
the
faces
flick
back
the
front
again
Harry
and
Ron
handed
Stan
eleven
Sickles
each
the
bus
set
off
again
swaying
ominously
rumbled
around
Grimmauld
Place
weaving
and
off
the
pavement
then
with
another
tremendous
BANG
they
were
all
flung
backwards
Ron
chair
toppled
right
over
and
Pigwidgeon
who
had
been
his
lap
burst
out
his
cage
and
flew
twittering
wildly
the
front
the
bus
where
fluttered
down
Hermione
shoulder
instead
Harry
who
had
narrowly
avoided
falling
seizing
candle
bracket
looked
out
the
window
they
were
now
speeding
down
what
appeared
motorway
Just
outside
Birmingham
said
Stan
happily
answering
Harry
unasked
question
Ron
struggled
from
the
floor
You
keepin
well
then
Arry
seen
your
name
the
paper
loads
over
the
summer
but

never

nice
said
Ern
said
didn
seem
like
nutter
when
met
just
goes
show
dunnit
handed
over
their
tickets
and
continued
gaze
enthralled
Harry
Apparently
Stan
did
not
care
how
nutty
somebody
was
they
were
famous
enough
the
paper
The
Knight
Bus
swayed
alarmingly
overtaking
line
cars
the
inside
Looking
towards
the
front
the
bus
Harry
saw
Hermione
cover
her
eyes
with
her
hands
Pigwidgeon
swaying
happily
her
shoulder
BANG
Chairs
slid
backwards
again
the
Knight
Bus
jumped
from
the
Birmingham
motorway
quiet
country
lane
full
hairpin
bends
Hedgerows
either
side
the
road
were
leaping
out
their
way
they
mounted
the
verges
From
here
they
moved
main
street
the
middle
busy
town
then
viaduct
surrounded
tall
hills
then
windswept
road
between
high
rise
flats
each
time
with
loud
BANG
changed
mind
muttered
Ron
picking
himself
from
the
floor
for
the
sixth
time
never
want
ride
this
thing
again
Listen
Ogwarts
stop
after
this
said
Stan
brightly
swaying
towards
them
That
bossy
woman
front
got
with
you
she
given
little
tip
move
you
the
queue
just
gonna
let
Madam
Marsh
off
first
though
there
was
retching
sound
from
downstairs
followed
horrible
spattering
noise
she
not
feeling
best
few
minutes
later
the
Knight
Bus
screeched
halt
outside
small
pub
which
squeezed
itself
out
the
way
avoid
collision
They
could
hear
Stan
ushering
the
unfortunate
Madam
Marsh
out
the
bus
and
the
relieved
murmurings
her
fellow
passengers
the
second
deck
The
bus
moved
again
gathering
speed
until
BANG
They
were
rolling
through
snowy
Hogsmeade
Harry
caught
glimpse
the
Hog
Head
down
its
side
street
the
severed
boar
head
sign
creaking
the
wintry
wind
Flecks
snow
hit
the
large
window
the
front
the
bus
last
they
rolled
halt
outside
the
gates
Hogwarts
Lupin
and
Tonks
helped
them
off
the
bus
with
their
luggage
then
got
off
say
goodbye
Harry
glanced
the
three
decks
the
Knight
Bus
and
saw
all
the
passengers
staring
down
them
noses
flat
against
the
windows
You
safe
once
you
the
grounds
said
Tonks
casting
careful
eye
around
the
deserted
road
Have
good
term
Look
after
yourselves
said
Lupin
shaking
hands
all
round
and
reaching
Harry
last
And
listen
lowered
his
voice
while
the
rest
them
exchanged
last
minute
goodbyes
with
Tonks
Harry
know
you
don
like
Snape
but
superb
Occlumens
and
all
Sirius
included
want
you
learn
protect
yourself
work
hard
all
right
Yeah
all
right
said
Harry
heavily
looking
into
Lupin
prematurely
lined
face
See
you
then
The
six
them
struggled
the
slippery
drive
towards
the
castle
dragging
their
trunks
Hermione
was
already
talking
about
knitting
few
elf
hats
before
bedtime
Harry
glanced
back
when
they
reached
the
oaken
front
doors
the
Knight
Bus
had
already
gone
and
half
wished
given
what
was
coming
the
following
evening
that
was
still
board
Harry
spent
most
the
next
day
dreading
the
evening
His
morning
double
Potions
lesson
did
nothing
dispel
his
trepidation
Snape
was
unpleasant
ever
His
mood
was
further
lowered
the
members
constantly
approaching
him
the
corridors
between
classes
asking
hopefully
there
would
meeting
that
night
let
you
know
the
usual
way
when
the
next
one
Harry
said
over
and
over
again
but
can
tonight
got
remedial
Potions
You
takeremedial
Potions
asked
Zacharias
Smith
superciliously
having
cornered
Harry
the
Entrance
Hall
after
lunch
Good
Lord
you
must
terrible
Snape
doesn
usually
give
extra
lessons
does
Smith
strode
away
annoyingly
buoyant
fashion
Ron
glared
after
him
Shall
jinx
him
can
still
get
him
from
here
said
raising
his
wand
and
taking
aim
between
Smith
shoulder
blades
Forget
said
Harry
dismally
what
everyone
going
think
isn
That
really
stup
Harry
said
voice
behind
him
turned
round
and
found
Cho
standing
there
said
Harry
his
stomach
leapt
uncomfortably
the
library
Harry
said
Hermione
firmly
she
seized
Ron
above
the
elbow
and
dragged
him
off
towards
the
marble
staircase
Had
good
Christmas
asked
Cho
Yeah
not
bad
said
Harry
Mine
was
pretty
quiet
said
Cho
For
some
reason
she
was
looking
rather
embarrassed
Erm
there
another
Hogsmeade
trip
next
month
did
you
see
the
notice
What
haven
checked
the
noticeboard
since
got
back
Yes
Valentine
Day
Right
said
Harry
wondering
why
she
was
telling
him
this
Well
suppose
you
want
Only
you
she
said
eagerly
Harry
stared
had
been
about
say
suppose
you
want
know
when
the
next
meeting
but
her
response
did
not
seem
fit
said
you
don
she
said
looking
mortified
Don
worry
see
you
around
She
walked
away
Harry
stood
staring
after
her
his
brain
working
frantically
Then
something
clunked
into
place
Cho
Hey
CHO
ran
after
her
catching
her
halfway
the
marble
staircase
you
want
come
into
Hogsmeade
with
Valentine
Day
Oooh
yes
she
said
blushing
crimson
and
beaming
him
Right
well
that
settled
then
said
Harry
and
feeling
that
the
day
was
not
going
complete
loss
after
all
virtually
bounced
off
the
library
pick
Ron
and
Hermione
before
their
afternoon
lessons
six
clock
that
evening
however
even
the
glow
having
successfully
asked
out
Cho
Chang
could
not
lighten
the
ominous
feelings
that
intensified
with
every
step
Harry
took
towards
Snape
office
paused
outside
the
door
when
reached
wishing
were
almost
anywhere
else
then
taking
deep
breath
knocked
and
entered
The
shadowy
room
was
lined
with
shelves
bearing
hundreds
glass
jars
which
slimy
bits
animals
and
plants
were
suspended
variously
coloured
potions
one
corner
stood
the
cupboard
full
ingredients
that
Snape
had
once
accused
Harry
not
without
reason
robbing
Harry
attention
was
drawn
towards
the
desk
however
where
shallow
stone
basin
engraved
with
runes
and
symbols
lay
pool
candlelight
Harry
recognised
once
was
Dumbledore
Pensieve
Wondering
what
earth
was
doing
there
jumped
when
Snape
cold
voice
came
out
the
shadows
Shut
the
door
behind
you
Potter
Harry
did
was
told
with
the
horrible
feeling
that
was
imprisoning
himself
When
turned
back
into
the
room
Snape
had
moved
into
the
light
and
was
pointing
silently
the
chair
opposite
his
desk
Harry
sat
down
and
did
Snape
his
cold
black
eyes
fixed
unblinkingly
upon
Harry
dislike
etched
every
line
his
face
Well
Potter
you
know
why
you
are
here
said
The
Headmaster
has
asked
teach
you
Occlumency
can
only
hope
that
you
prove
more
adept
than
Potions
Right
said
Harry
tersely
This
may
not
ordinary
class
Potter
said
Snape
his
eyes
narrowed
malevolently
but
still
your
teacher
and
you
will
therefore
call
sir
Professor
all
times
Yes
sir
said
Harry
Snape
continued
survey
him
through
narrowed
eyes
for
moment
then
said
Now
Occlumency
told
you
back
your
dear
godfather
kitchen
this
branch
magic
seals
the
mind
against
magical
intrusion
and
influence
And
why
does
Professor
Dumbledore
think
need
sir
said
Harry
looking
directly
into
Snape
eyes
and
wondering
whether
Snape
would
answer
Snape
looked
back
him
for
moment
and
then
said
contemptuously
Surely
even
you
could
have
worked
that
out
now
Potter
The
Dark
Lord
highly
skilled
Legilimency
What
that
Sir
the
ability
extract
feelings
and
memories
from
another
person
mind
can
read
minds
said
Harry
quickly
his
worst
fears
confirmed
You
have
subtlety
Potter
said
Snape
his
dark
eyes
glittering
You
not
understand
fine
distinctions
one
the
shortcomings
that
makes
you
such
lamentable
potion
maker
Snape
paused
for
moment
apparently
savour
the
pleasure
insulting
Harry
before
continuing
Only
Muggles
talk
mind
reading
The
mind
not
book
opened
will
and
examined
leisure
Thoughts
are
not
etched
the
inside
skulls
perused
any
invader
The
mind
complex
and
many
layered
thing
Potter
least
most
minds
are
smirked
true
however
that
those
who
have
mastered
Legilimency
are
able
under
certain
conditions
delve
into
the
minds
their
victims
and
interpret
their
findings
correctly
The
Dark
Lord
for
instance
almost
always
knows
when
somebody
lying
him
Only
those
skilled
Occlumency
are
able
shut
down
those
feelings
and
memories
that
contradict
the
lie
and
can
utter
falsehoods
his
presence
without
detection
Whatever
Snape
said
Legilimency
sounded
like
mind
reading
Harry
and
didn
like
the
sound
all
could
know
what
thinking
right
now
Sir
The
Dark
Lord
considerable
distance
and
the
walls
and
grounds
Hogwarts
are
guarded
many
ancient
spells
and
charms
ensure
the
bodily
and
mental
safety
those
who
dwell
within
them
said
Snape
Time
and
space
matter
magic
Potter
Eye
contact
often
essential
Legilimency
Well
then
why
have
learn
Occlumency
Snape
eyed
Harry
tracing
his
mouth
with
one
long
thin
finger
did
The
usual
rules
not
seem
apply
with
you
Potter
The
curse
that
failed
kill
you
seems
have
forged
some
kind
connection
between
you
and
the
Dark
Lord
The
evidence
suggests
that
times
when
your
mind
most
relaxed
and
vulnerable
when
you
are
asleep
for
instance
you
are
sharing
the
Dark
Lord
thoughts
and
emotions
The
Headmaster
thinks
inadvisable
for
this
continue
wishes
teach
you
how
close
your
mind
the
Dark
Lord
Harry
heart
was
pumping
fast
again
None
this
added
But
why
does
Professor
Dumbledore
want
stop
asked
abruptly
don
like
much
but
been
useful
hasn
mean
saw
that
snake
attack
Weasley
and
hadn
Professor
Dumbledore
wouldn
have
been
able
save
him
would
Sir
Snape
stared
Harry
for
few
moments
still
tracing
his
mouth
with
his
finger
When
spoke
again
was
slowly
and
deliberately
though
weighed
every
word
appears
that
the
Dark
Lord
has
been
unaware
the
connection
between
you
and
himself
until
very
recently
till
now
seems
that
you
have
been
experiencing
his
emotions
and
sharing
his
thoughts
without
his
being
any
the
wiser
However
the
vision
you
had
shortly
before
Christmas
The
one
with
the
snake
and
Weasley
not
interrupt
Potter
said
Snape
dangerous
voice
was
saying
the
vision
you
had
shortly
before
Christmas
represented
such
powerful
incursion
upon
the
Dark
Lord
thoughts
saw
inside
the
snake
head
not
his
thought
just
told
you
not
interrupt
Potter
But
Harry
did
not
care
Snape
was
angry
last
seemed
getting
the
bottom
this
business
had
moved
forwards
his
chair
that
without
realising
was
perched
the
very
edge
tense
though
poised
for
flight
How
come
saw
through
the
snake
eyes
Voldemort
thoughts
sharing
not
say
the
Dark
Lord
name
spat
Snape
There
was
nasty
silence
They
glared
each
other
across
the
Pensieve
Professor
Dumbledore
says
his
name
said
Harry
quietly
Dumbledore
extremely
powerful
wizard
Snape
muttered
Whilehe
may
feel
secure
enough
use
the
name
the
rest
rubbed
his
left
forearm
apparently
unconsciously
the
spot
where
Harry
knew
the
Dark
Mark
was
burned
into
his
skin
just
wanted
know
Harry
began
again
forcing
his
voice
back
politeness
why
You
seem
have
visited
the
snake
mind
because
that
was
where
the
Dark
Lord
was
that
particular
moment
snarled
Snape
was
possessing
the
snake
the
time
and
you
dreamed
you
were
inside
too
And
Vol
realised
was
there
seems
said
Snape
coolly
How
you
know
said
Harry
urgently
this
just
Professor
Dumbledore
guessing
told
you
said
Snape
rigid
his
chair
his
eyes
slits
call
sir
Yes
sir
said
Harry
impatiently
but
how
you
know
enough
that
know
said
Snape
repressively
The
important
point
that
the
Dark
Lord
now
aware
that
you
are
gaining
access
his
thoughts
and
feelings
has
also
deduced
that
the
process
likely
work
reverse
that
say
has
realised
that
might
able
access
your
thoughts
and
feelings
return
And
might
try
and
make
things
asked
Harry
Sir
added
hurriedly
might
said
Snape
sounding
cold
and
unconcerned
Which
brings
back
Occlumency
Snape
pulled
out
his
wand
from
inside
pocket
his
robes
and
Harry
tensed
his
chair
but
Snape
merely
raised
the
wand
his
temple
and
placed
its
tip
into
the
greasy
roots
his
hair
When
withdrew
some
silvery
substance
came
away
stretching
from
temple
wand
like
thick
gossamer
strand
which
broke
pulled
the
wand
away
from
and
fell
gracefully
into
the
Pensieve
where
swirled
silvery
white
neither
gas
nor
liquid
Twice
more
Snape
raised
the
wand
his
temple
and
deposited
the
silvery
substance
into
the
stone
basin
then
without
offering
any
explanation
his
behaviour
picked
the
Pensieve
carefully
removed
shelf
out
their
way
and
returned
face
Harry
with
his
wand
held
the
ready
Stand
and
take
out
your
wand
Potter
Harry
got
his
feet
feeling
nervous
They
faced
each
other
with
the
desk
between
them
You
may
use
your
wand
attempt
disarm
defend
yourself
any
other
way
you
can
think
said
Snape
And
what
are
you
going
Harry
asked
eyeing
Snape
wand
apprehensively
about
attempt
break
into
your
mind
said
Snape
softly
are
going
see
how
well
you
resist
have
been
told
that
you
have
already
shown
aptitude
resisting
the
Imperius
Curse
You
will
find
that
similar
powers
are
needed
for
this
brace
yourself
now
Legilimens
Snape
had
struck
before
Harry
was
ready
before
had
even
begun
summon
any
force
resistance
The
office
swam
front
his
eyes
and
vanished
image
after
image
was
racing
through
his
mind
like
flickering
film
vivid
blinded
him
his
surroundings

watching

his

Cho
drew
nearer
you
not

you
not
watching

felt
sharp
pain
his
knee
Snape
office
had
come
back
into
view
and
realised
that
had
fallen
the
floor
one
his
knees
had
collided
painfully
with
the
leg
Snape
desk
looked
Snape
who
had
lowered
his
wand
and
was
rubbing
his
wrist
There
was
angry
weal
there
like
scorch
mark
Did
you
mean
produce
Stinging
Hex
asked
Snape
coolly
said
Harry
bitterly
getting
from
the
floor
thought
not
said
Snape
watching
him
closely
You
let
get
too
far
You
lost
control
Did
you
see
everything
saw
Harry
asked
unsure
whether
wanted
hear
the
answer
Flashes
said
Snape
his
lip
curling
whom
did
the
dog
belong
Aunt
Marge
Harry
muttered
hating
Snape
Well
for
first
attempt
that
was
not
poor
might
have
been
said
Snape
raising
his
wand
once
more
You
managed
stop
eventually
though
you
wasted
time
and
energy
shouting
You
must
remain
focused
Repel
with
your
brain
and
you
will
not
need
resort
your
wand
trying
said
Harry
angrily
but
you
not
telling
how
Manners
Potter
said
Snape
dangerously
Now
want
you
close
your
eyes
Harry
threw
him
filthy
look
before
doing
was
told
did
not
like
the
idea
standing
there
with
his
eyes
shut
while
Snape
faced
him
carrying
wand
Clear
your
mind
Potter
said
Snape
cold
voice
Let
all
emotion
But
Harry
anger
Snape
continued
pound
through
his
veins
like
venom
Let
his
anger
could
easily
detach
his
legs
You
not
doing
Potter
you
will
need
more
discipline
than
this
focus
now
Harry
tried
empty
his
mind
tried
not
think
remember
feel
Let
again
the

three
one
two

Legilimens
great
black
dragon
was
rearing
front
him
his
father
and
mother
were
waving
him
out
enchanted
mirror
Cedric
Diggory
was
lying
the
ground
with
blank
eyes
staring
him
NOOOOOOO
Harry
was
his
knees
again
his
face
buried
his
hands
his
brain
aching
though
someone
had
been
trying
pull
from
his
skull
Get
said
Snape
sharply
Get
You
are
not
trying
you
are
making
effort
You
are
allowing
access
memories
you
fear
handing
weapons
Harry
stood
again
his
heart
thumping
wildly
though
had
really
just
seen
Cedric
dead
the
graveyard
Snape
looked
paler
than
usual
and
angrier
though
not
nearly
angry
Harry
was
making
effort
said
through
clenched
teeth
told
you
empty
yourself
emotion
Yeah
Well
finding
that
hard
the
moment
Harry
snarled
Then
you
will
find
yourself
easy
prey
for
the
Dark
Lord
said
Snape
savagely
Fools
who
wear
their
hearts
proudly
their
sleeves
who
cannot
control
their
emotions
who
wallow
sad
memories
and
allow
themselves
provoked
easily
weak
people
other
words
they
stand
chance
against
his
powers
will
penetrate
your
mind
with
absurd
ease
Potter
not
weak
said
Harry
low
voice
fury
now
pumping
through
him
that
thought
might
attack
Snape
moment
Then
prove
Master
yourself
spat
Snape
Control
your
anger
discipline
your
mind
shall
try
again
Get
ready
now
Legilimens
was
watching
Uncle
Vernon
hammering
the
letterbox
shut
hundred
Dementors
were
drifting
across
the
lake
the
grounds
towards
him
was
running
along
windowless
passage
with
Weasley
they
were
drawing
nearer
the
plain
black
door
the
end
the
corridor
Harry
expected
through
but
Weasley
led
him
off
the
left
down
flight
stone
steps
KNOW
KNOW
was
all
fours
again
Snape
office
floor
his
scar
was
prickling
unpleasantly
but
the
voice
that
had
just
issued
from
his
mouth
was
triumphant
pushed
himself
again
find
Snape
staring
him
his
wand
raised
looked
though
this
time
Snape
had
lifted
the
spell
before
Harry
had
even
tried
fight
back
What
happened
then
Potter
asked
eyeing
Harry
intently
saw
remembered
Harry
panted
just
realised
Realised
what
asked
Snape
sharply
Harry
did
not
answer
once
was
still
savouring
the
moment
blinding
realisation
rubbed
his
forehead
had
been
dreaming
about
windowless
corridor
ending
locked
door
for
months
without
once
realising
that
was
real
place
Now
seeing
the
memory
again
knew
that
all
along
had
been
dreaming
about
the
corridor
down
which
had
run
with
Weasley
the
twelfth
August
they
hurried
the
courtrooms
the
Ministry
was
the
corridor
leading
the
Department
Mysteries
and
Weasley
had
been
there
the
night
that
had
been
attacked
Voldemort
snake
looked
Snape
What
the
Department
Mysteries
What
did
you
say
Snape
asked
quietly
and
Harry
saw
with
deep
satisfaction
that
Snape
was
unnerved
said
what
the
Department
Mysteries
sir
Harry
said
And
why
said
Snape
slowly
would
you
ask
such
thing
Because
said
Harry
watching
Snape
face
closely
that
corridor
just
seen
been
dreaming
about
for
months
just
recognised
leads
the
Department
Mysteries
and
think
Voldemort
wants
something
from
have
told
you
not
say
the
Dark
Lord
name
They
glared
each
other
Harry
scar
seared
again
but
did
not
care
Snape
looked
agitated
but
when
spoke
again
sounded
though
was
trying
appear
cool
and
unconcerned
There
are
many
things
the
Department
Mysteries
Potter
few
which
you
would
understand
and
none
which
concern
you
make
myself
plain
Yes
Harry
said
still
rubbing
his
prickling
scar
which
was
becoming
more
painful
want
you
back
here
same
time
Wednesday
will
continue
work
then
Fine
said
Harry
was
desperate
get
out
Snape
office
and
find
Ron
and
Hermione
You
are
rid
your
mind
all
emotion
every
night
before
sleep
empty
make
blank
and
calm
you
understand
Yes
said
Harry
who
was
barely
listening
And
warned
Potter
shall
know
you
have
not
practised
Right
Harry
mumbled
picked
his
schoolbag
swung
over
his
shoulder
and
hurried
towards
the
office
door
opened
glanced
back
Snape
who
had
his
back
Harry
and
was
scooping
his
own
thoughts
out
the
Pensieve
with
the
tip
his
wand
and
replacing
them
carefully
inside
his
own
head
Harry
left
without
another
word
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
his
scar
still
throbbing
painfully
Harry
found
Ron
and
Hermione
the
library
where
they
were
working
Umbridge
most
recent
ream
homework
Other
students
nearly
all
them
fifth
years
sat
lamp
lit
tables
nearby
noses
close
books
quills
scratching
feverishly
while
the
sky
outside
the
mulhoned
windows
grew
steadily
blacker
The
only
other
sound
was
the
slight
squeaking
one
Madam
Pince
shoes
the
librarian
prowled
the
aisles
menacingly
breathing
down
the
necks
those
touching
her
precious
books
Harry
felt
shivery
his
scar
was
still
aching
felt
almost
feverish
When
sat
down
opposite
Ron
and
Hermione
caught
sight
himself
the
window
opposite
was
very
white
and
his
scar
seemed
showing
more
clearly
than
usual
How
did
Hermione
whispered
and
then
looking
concerned
Are
you
all
right
Harry
Yeah
fine
dunno
said
Harry
impatiently
wincing
pain
shot
through
his
scar
again
Listen
just
realised
something
And
told
them
what
had
just
seen
and
deduced
are
you
saying
whispered
Ron
Madam
Pince
swept
past
squeaking
slightly
that
the
weapon
the
thing
You
Know
Who
after
the
Ministry
Magic
the
Department
Mysteries
got
Harry
whispered
saw
that
door
when
your
dad
took
down
the
courtrooms
for
hearing
and
definitely
the
same
one
was
guarding
when
the
snake
bit
him
Hermione
let
out
long
slow
sigh
course
she
breathed
course
what
said
Ron
rather
impatiently
Ron
think
about
Sturgis
Podmore
was
trying
get
through
door
the
Ministry
Magic
must
have
been
that
one
too
much
coincidence
How
come
Sturgis
was
trying
break
when
our
side
said
Ron
Well
don
know
Hermione
admitted
That
bit
odd
what
the
Department
Mysteries
Harry
asked
Ron
Has
your
dad
ever
mentioned
anything
about
know
they
call
the
people
who
work
there
Unspeakables
said
Ron
frowning
Because
one
really
seems
know
what
they
weird
place
have
weapon
not
weird
all
makes
perfect
sense
said
Hermione
will
something
top
secret
that
the
Ministry
has
been
developing
expect
Harry
are
you
sure
you
all
right
For
Harry
had
just
run
both
his
hands
hard
over
his
forehead
though
trying
iron
Yeah
fine
said
lowering
his
hands
which
were
trembling
just
feel
bit
don
like
Occlumency
much
expect
anyone
would
feel
shaky
they
had
their
mind
attacked
over
and
over
again
said
Hermione
sympathetically
Look
let
get
back
the
common
room
bit
more
comfortable
there
But
the
common
room
was
packed
and
full
shrieks
laughter
and
excitement
Fred
and
George
were
demonstrating
their
latest
bit
joke
shop
merchandise
Headless
Hats
shouted
George
Fred
waved
pointed
hat
decorated
with
fluffy
pink
feather
the
watching
students
Two
Galleons
each
watch
Fred
now
Fred
swept
the
hat
his
head
beaming
For
second
merely
looked
rather
stupid
then
both
hat
and
head
vanished
Several
girls
screamed
but
everyone
else
was
roaring
with
laughter
And
off
again
shouted
George
and
Fred
hand
groped
for
moment
what
seemed
thin
air
over
his
shoulder
then
his
head
reappeared
swept
the
pink
feathered
hat
from
How
those
hats
work
then
said
Hermione
distracted
from
her
homework
and
watching
Fred
and
George
closely
mean
obviously
some
kind
Invisibility
Spell
but
rather
clever
have
extended
the
field
invisibility
beyond
the
boundaries
the
charmed
object
dimagine
the
charm
wouldn
have
very
long
life
though
Harry
did
not
answer
was
feeling
ill
going
have
this
tomorrow
muttered
pushing
the
books
had
just
taken
out
his
bag
back
inside
Well
write
your
homework
planner
then
said
Hermione
encouragingly
you
don
forget
Harry
and
Ron
exchanged
looks
reached
into
his
bag
withdrew
the
planner
and
opened
tentatively
Don
leave
till
later
you
big
second
rater
chided
the
book
Harry
scribbled
down
Umbridge
homework
Hermione
beamed
think
bed
said
Harry
stuffing
the
homework
planner
back
into
his
bag
and
making
mental
note
drop
the
fire
the
first
opportunity
got
walked
across
the
common
room
dodging
George
who
tried
put
Headless
Hat
him
and
reached
the
peace
and
cool
the
stone
staircase
the
boys
dormitories
was
feeling
sick
again
just
had
the
night
had
had
the
vision
the
snake
but
thought
that
could
just
lie
down
for
while
would
all
right
opened
the
door
his
dormitory
and
was
one
step
inside
when
experienced
pain
severe
thought
that
someone
must
have
sliced
into
the
top
his
head
did
not
know
where
was
whether
was
standing
lying
down
did
not
even
know
his
own
name
Maniacal
laughter
was
ringing
his
ears
was
happier
than
had
been
very
long
time
jubilant
ecstatic
triumphant
wonderful
wonderful
thing
had
happened
Harry
HARRY
Someone
had
hit
him
around
the
face
The
insane
laughter
was
punctuated
with
cry
pain
The
happiness
was
draining
out
him
but
the
laughter
continued
opened
his
eyes
and
did
became
aware
that
the
wild
laughter
was
coming
out
his
own
mouth
The
moment
realised
this
died
away
Harry
lay
panting
the
floor
staring
the
ceiling
the
scar
his
forehead
throbbing
horribly
Ron
was
bending
over
him
looking
very
worried
What
happened
said
dunno
Harry
gasped
sitting
again
really
happy
really
happy
You
Know
Who
Something
good
happened
mumbled
Harry
was
shaking
badly
had
done
after
seeing
the
snake
attack
Weasley
and
felt
very
sick
Something
been
hoping
for
The
words
came
just
they
had
back
the
Gryffindor
changing
room
though
stranger
was
speaking
them
through
Harry
mouth
yet
knew
they
were
true
took
deep
breaths
willing
himself
not
vomit
all
over
Ron
was
very
glad
that
Dean
and
Seamus
were
not
here
watch
this
time
Hermione
told
come
and
check
you
said
Ron
low
voice
helping
Harry
his
feet
She
says
your
defences
will
low
the
moment
after
Snape
been
fiddling
around
with
your
mind
still
suppose
help
the
long
run
won
looked
doubtfully
Harry
helped
him
towards
his
bed
Harry
nodded
without
any
conviction
and
slumped
back
his
pillows
aching
all
over
from
having
fallen
the
floor
often
that
evening
his
scar
still
prickling
painfully
could
not
help
feeling
that
his
first
foray
into
Occlumency
had
weakened
his
mind
sresistance
rather
than
strengthening
and
wondered
with
feeling
great
trepidation
what
had
happened
make
Lord
Voldemort
the
happiest
had
been
fourteen
years
THE
BEETLE
BAY
Harry
question
was
answered
the
very
next
morning
When
Hermione
sDaily
Prophet
arrived
she
smoothed
out
gazed
for
moment
the
front
page
and
gave
yelp
that
caused
everyone
the
vicinity
stare
her
What
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
For
answer
she
spread
the
newspaper
the
table
front
them
and
pointed
ten
black
and
white
photographs
that
filled
the
whole
the
front
page
nine
showing
wizards
faces
and
the
tenth
witch
Some
the
people
the
photographs
were
silently
jeering
others
were
tapping
their
fingers
the
frame
their
pictures
looking
insolent
Each
picture
was
captioned
with
name
and
the
crime
for
which
the
person
had
been
sent
Azkaban
Antonin
Dolohov
read
the
legend
beneath
wizard
with
long
pale
twisted
face
who
was
sneering
Harry
convicted
the
brutal
murders
Gideon
and
Fabian
Prewett
Algernon
Rookwood
said
the
caption
beneath
pockmarked
man
with
greasy
hair
who
was
leaning
against
the
edge
his
picture
looking
bored
convicted
leaking
Ministry
Magic
secrets
Who
Must
Not
Named
But
Harry
eyes
were
drawn
the
picture
the
witch
Her
face
had
leapt
out
him
the
moment
had
seen
the
page
She
had
long
dark
hair
that
looked
unkempt
and
straggly
the
picture
though
had
seen
sleek
thick
and
shining
She
glared
him
through
heavily
lidded
eyes
arrogant
disdainful
smile
playing
around
her
thin
mouth
Like
Sirius
she
retained
vestiges
great
good
looks
but
something
perhaps
Azkaban
had
taken
most
her
beauty
Bellatrix
Lestrange
convicted
the
torture
and
permanent
incapacitation
Frank
and
Alice
Longbottom
Hermione
nudged
Harry
and
pointed
the
headline
over
the
pictures
which
Harry
concentrating
Bellatrix
had
not
yet
read
MASS
BREAKOUT
FROM
AZKABAN
MINISTRY
FEARS
BLACK
RALLYING
POINT
FOR
OLD
DEATH
EATERS
Black
said
Harry
loudly
Not
Shhh
whispered
Hermione
desperately
Not
loud
just
read
The
Ministry
Magic
announced
late
last
night
that
there
has
been
mass
breakout
from
Azkaban
Speaking
reporters
his
private
office
Cornelius
Fudge
Minister
for
Magic
confirmed
that
ten
high
security
prisoners
escaped
the
early
hours
yesterday
evening
and
that
has
already
informed
the
Muggle
Prime
Minister
the
dangerous
nature
these
individuals
find
ourselves
most
unfortunately
the
same
position
were
two
and
half
years
ago
when
the
murderer
Sinus
Black
escaped
said
Fudge
last
night
Nor
think
the
two
breakouts
are
unrelated
escape
this
magnitude
suggests
outside
help
and
must
remember
that
Black
asthe
first
person
ever
break
out
Azkaban
would
ideally
placed
help
others
follow
his
footsteps
think
likely
that
these
individuals
who
include
Black
cousin
Bellatrix
Lestrange
have
rallied
around
Black
their
leader
are
however
doing
all
can
round
the
criminals
and
beg
the
magical
community
remain
alert
and
cautious
account
should
any
these
individuals
approached
There
you
are
Harry
said
Ron
looking
awestruck
That
why
was
happy
last
night
don
believe
this
snarled
Harry
Fudge
blaming
the
breakout
Sirius
What
other
options
does
have
said
Hermione
bitterly
can
hardly
say
Sorry
everyone
Dumbledore
warned
this
might
happen
the
Azkaban
guards
have
joined
Lord
Voldemort
stopwhimpering
Ron
and
now
Voldemort
worst
supporters
have
broken
out
too
mean
spent
good
six
months
telling
everyone
you
and
Dumbledore
are
liars
hasn
Hermione
ripped
open
the
newspaper
and
began
read
the
report
inside
while
Harry
looked
around
the
Great
Hall
could
not
understand
why
his
fellow
students
were
not
looking
scared
least
discussing
the
terrible
piece
news
the
front
page
but
very
few
them
took
the
newspaper
every
day
like
Hermione
There
they
all
were
talking
about
homework
and
Quidditch
and
who
knew
what
other
rubbish
when
outside
these
walls
ten
more
Death
Eaters
had
swollen
Voldemort
ranks
glanced
the
staff
table
was
different
story
there
Dumbledore
and
Professor
McGonagall
were
deep
conversation
both
looking
extremely
grave
Professor
Sprout
had
theProphet
propped
against
bottle
ketchup
and
was
reading
the
front
page
with
such
concentration
that
she
was
not
noticing
the
gentle
drip
egg
yolk
falling
into
her
lap
from
her
stationary
spoon
Meanwhile
the
far
end
the
table
Professor
Umbridge
was
tucking
into
bowl
porridge
For
once
her
pouchy
toad
eyes
were
not
sweeping
the
Great
Hall
looking
for
misbehaving
students
She
scowled
she
gulped
down
her
food
and
every
now
and
then
she
shot
malevolent
glance
the
table
where
Dumbledore
and
McGonagall
were
talking
intently
said
Hermione
wonderingly
still
staring
the
newspaper
What
now
said

She

Ron
Bode
rings

him
Hermione
whispered
Mungo
remember
was
the

opposite
Lockhart
just
lying
there
staring
the
ceiling
And
saw
the
Devil

arrive
She
the
Healer
said
was
Christmas
present
Harry
looked
back
the
story
feeling
horror
was
rising
like
bile
his
throat
How
come
didn
recognise
Devil
Snare
seen
before
could
stopped
this
from
happening
Who

Ron
sharply
not

whoever
sent
the
bloke

They
must
real
prat
why
didn
they
check
what
they
were
buying

Ron
said
Hermione
shakily
don
think
anyone
could
put
Devil
Snare
pot
and
not
realise
tries
kill
whoever
touches
This
this
was
murder
clever
murder
well
the
plant
was
sent
anonymously
how
anyone
ever
going
find
out
who
did
Harry
was
not
thinking
about
Devil
Snare
was
remembering
taking
the
lift
down
the
ninth
level
the
Ministry
the
day
his
hearing
and
the
sallow
faced
man
who
had
got

Bode

slowly

the

Unspeakable

the

They
looked
each
other
for
moment
then
Hermione
pulled
the
newspaper
back
towards
her
closed
glared
for
moment
the
pictures
the
ten
escaped
Death
Eaters
the
front
then
leapt
her
feet
Where

going
said
Ron
startled
send

said
Hermione
swinging
her
bag
her
shoulder
well
don
know
whether
but
worth
trying
and
the
only
one
who
can
Ihate
when
she
does
that
grumbled
Ron
and
Harry
got
from
the
table
and
made
their
own
slower
way
out
the
Great
Hall
Would
kill
her
tell
what
she
for
once
take
her
about
ten
more
seconds
hey
Hagrid
Hagrid
was
standing
beside
the
doors
into
the
Entrance
Hall
waiting
for
crowd
Ravenclaws
pass
was
still
heavily
bruised
had
been
the
day
had
come
back
from
his
mission
the
giants
and
there
was
new
cut
right
across
the
bridge
his
nose
All
righ
you
two
said
trying
muster
smile
but
managing
only
kind
pained
grimace
Are
you
Hagrid
asked
Harry
following
him
lumbered
after
the
Ravenclaws
Fine
fine
said
Hagrid
with
feeble
assumption
airiness
waved
hand
and
narrowly
missed
concussing
frightened
looking
Professor

was
passing
Jus

mumbled
You

said
Ron
very
loudly
that
many
the
passing
students
looked
around
curiously
Sorry

whispered
Yeah
said
Hagrid
more
expected
ter
tell
yeh
the
truth
Yeh
migh
not

that

didn
too
well
yeh

sighed
deeply
Bes
rub

more
chilli
powder
them
salamanders
their
tails
hangin
off
next
See
yeh
Harry
Ron
trudged
away
out
the
front
doors
and
down
the
stone
steps
into
the
damp
grounds
Harry
watched
him
wondering
how
much
more
bad
news
could
stand
The
fact
that
Hagrid
was
now
probation
became
common
knowledge
within
the
school
over
the
next
few
days
but
Harry
indignation
hardly
anybody
appeared
upset
about
indeed
some
people
Draco
Malfoy
prominent
among
them
seemed
positively
gleeful
for
the
freakish
death
obscure
Department
Mysteries
employee
Mungo
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
seemed
the
only
people
who
knewor
cared
There
was
only
one
topic
conversation
the
corridors
now
the
ten
escaped
Death
Eaters
whose
story
had
finally
filtered
through
the
school
from
those
few
people
who
read
the
newspapers
Rumours
were
flying
that
some
the
convicts
had
been
spotted
Hogsmeade
that
they
were
supposed
hiding
out
the
Shrieking
Shack
and
that
they
were
going
break
into
Hogwarts
just
Sirius
Black
had
once
done
Those
who
came
from
wizarding
families
had
grown
hearing
the
names
these
Death
Eaters
spoken
with
almost
much
fear
Voldemort
the
crimes
they
had
committed
during
the
days
Voldemort
reign
terror
were
legendary
There
were
relatives
their
victims
among
the
Hogwarts
students
who
now
found
themselves
the
unwilling
objects
gruesome
sort
reflected
fame
they
walked
the
corridors
Susan
Bones
whose
uncle
aunt
and
cousins
had
all
died
the
hands
one
the
ten
said
miserably
during
Herbology
that
she
now
had
good
idea
what
felt
like
Harry
And
don
know
how
you
stand
horrible
she
said
bluntly
dumping
far
too
much
dragon
manure
her
tray
Screechsnap
seedlings
causing
them
wriggle
and
squeak
discomfort
was
true
that
Harry
was
the
subject
much
renewed
muttering
and
pointing
the
corridors
these
days
yet
thought
detected
slight
difference
the
tone
the
whisperers
voices
They
sounded
curious
rather
than
hostile
now
and
once
twice
was
sure
overheard
snatches
conversation
that
suggested
that
the
speakers
were
not
satisfied
with
theProphet
version
how
and
why
ten
Death
Eaters
had
managed
break
out
the
Azkaban
fortress
their
confusion
and
fear
these
doubters
now
seemed
turning
the
only
other
explanation
available
them
the
one
that
Harry
and
Dumbledore
had
been
expounding
since
the
previous
year
was
not
only
the
students
mood
that
had
changed
was
now
quite
common
come
across
two
three
teachers
conversing
low
urgent
whispers
the
corridors
breaking
off
their
conversations
the
moment
they
saw
students
approaching
They
obviously
can
talk
freely
the
staff
room
any
more
said
Hermione
low
voice
she
Harry
and
Ron
passed
Professors
McGonagall
Flitwick
and
Sprout
huddled
together
outside
the
Charms
classroom
one
day
Not
with
Umbridge
there
Reckon
they
know
anything
new
said
Ron
gazing
back
over
his
shoulder
the
three
teachers
they
not
going
hear
about
are
said
Harry
angrily
Not
after
Decree
what
number
are
now
For
new
notices
had
appeared
the
house
noticeboards
the
morning
after
news
the
Azkaban
breakout

The

Twenty

Umbridge

Inquisitor
This
latest
Decree
had
been
the

great
number
jokes
among
the
students
Lee
Jordan
had
pointed
out
Umbridge
that
the
terms

new
rule
she
was
not
allowed

Fred
and
George

That

relating
your

When
Harry
next
saw
Lee
the
back
his
hand
was
bleeding
rather
badly
Harry
recommended
essence
Murtlap
Harry
had
thought
the
breakout
from
Azkaban
might
have
humbled
Umbridge
little
that
she
might
have
been
abashed
the
catastrophe
that
had
occurred
right
under
the
nose
her
beloved
Fudge
seemed
however
have
only
intensified
her
furious
desire
bring
every
aspect
life
Hogwarts
under
her
personal
control
She
seemed
determined
the
very
least
achieve
sacking
before
long
and
the
only
question
was
whether
would
Professor
Trelawney
Hagrid

went
first
Every
single
Divination
and
Care
Magical
Creatures
lesson
was
now
conducted
the
presence
Umbridge
and
her
clipboard
She
lurked
the
fire
the
heavily
perfumed
tower
room
interrupting
Professor
Trelawney
increasingly
hysterical
talks
with
difficult
questions
about
ornithomancy
and
heptomology
insisting
that
she
predicted
students
answers
before
they
gave
them
and
demanding
that
she
demonstrate
her
skill
the
crystal
ball
the
tea
leaves
and
the
rune
stones
turn
Harry
thought
Professor
Trelawney
might
soon
crack
under
the
strain
Several
times
passed
her
the
corridors
itself
very
unusual
occurrence
she
generally
remained
her
tower
room
muttering
wildly
herself
wringing
her
hands
and
shooting
terrified
glances
over
her
shoulder
and
all
the
while
giving
off
powerful
smell
cooking
sherry
had
not
been
worried
about
Hagrid
would
have
felt
sorry
for
her
but
one
them
was
ousted
from
their
job
there
could
only
one
choice
for
Harry
who
should
remain
Unfortunately
Harry
could
not
see
that
Hagrid
was
putting
better
show
than
Trelawney
Though
seemed
following
Hermione
advice
and
had
shown
them
nothing
more
frightening
than
Crup
creature
indistinguishable
from
Jack
Russell
terrier
except
for
its
forked
tail
since
before
Christmas
too
seemed
have
lost
his
nerve
was
oddly
distracted
and
jumpy
during
lessons
losing
the
thread
what
was
saying
the
class
answering
questions
wrongly
and
all
the
time
glancing
anxiously
Umbridge
was
also
more
distant
with
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
than
had
ever
been
before
and
had
expressly
forbidden
them
visit
him
after
dark
she
catches
yeh
all
our
necks
the
line
told
them
flatly
and
with
desire
anything
that
might
jeopardise
his
job
further
they
abstained
from
walking
down
his
hut
the
evenings
seemed
Harry
that
Umbridge
was
steadily
depriving
him
everything
that
made
his
life
Hogwarts
worth
living
visits
Hagrid
house
letters
from
Sirius
his
Firebolt
and
Quidditch
took
his
revenge
the
only
way
could
redoubling
his
efforts
for
the
Harry
was
pleased
see
that
all
them
even
Zacharias
Smith
had
been
spurred
work
harder
than
ever
the
news
that
ten
more
Death
Eaters
were
now
the
loose
but
nobody
was
this
improvement
more
pronounced
than
Neville
The
news
his
parents
attackers
escape
had
wrought
strange
and
even
slightly
alarming
change
him
had
not
once
mentioned
his
meeting
with
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
the
closed
ward
Mungo
and
taking
their
lead
from
him
they
had
kept
quiet
about
too
Nor
had
said
anything
the
subject
Bellatrix
and
her
fellow
torturers
escape
fact
Neville
barely
spoke
during
the
meetings
any
more
but
worked
relentlessly
every
new
jinx
and
counter
curse
Harry
taught
them
his
plump
face
screwed
concentration
apparently
indifferent
injuries
accidents
and
working
harder
than
anyone
else
the
room
was
improvingso
fast
was
quite
unnerving
and
when
Harry
taught
them
the
Shield
Charm
means
deflecting
minor
jinxes
that
they
rebounded
upon
the
attacker
only
Hermione
mastered
the
charm
faster
than
Neville
Harry
would
have
given
great
deal
making
much
progress
Occlumency
Neville
was
making
during
the
meetings
Harry
sessions
with
Snape
which
had
started
badly
enough
were
not
improving
the
contrary
Harry
felt
was
getting
worse
with
every
lesson
Before
had
started
studying
Occlumency
his
scar
had
prickled
occasionally
usually
during
the
night
else
following
one
those
strange
flashes
Voldemort
thoughts
mood
that
experienced
every
now
and
then
Nowadays
however
his
scar
hardly
ever
stopped
prickling
and
often
felt
lurches
annoyance
cheerfulness
that
were
unrelated
what
was
happening
him
the
time
which
were
always
accompanied
particularly
painful
twinge
from
his
scar
had
the
horrible
impression
that
was
slowly
turning
into
kind
aerial
that
was
tuned
tiny
fluctuations
Voldemorts
mood
and
was
sure
could
date
this
increased
sensitivity
firmly
from
his
first
Occlumency
lesson
with
Snape
What
was
more
was
now
dreaming
about
walking
down
the
corridor
towards
the
entrance
the
Department
Mysteries
almost
every
night
dreams
which
always
culminated
him
standing
longingly
front
the
plain
black
door
Maybe
bit
like
illness
said
Hermione
looking
concerned
when
Harry
confided
her
and
Ron
fever
something
has
get
worse
before
gets
better
The
lessons
with
Snape
are
making
worse
said
Harry
flatly
getting
sick
scar
hurting
and
getting
bored
with
walking
down
that
corridor
every
night
rubbed
his
forehead
angrily
just
wish
the
door
would
open
sick
standing
staring
That
not
funny
said
Hermione
sharply
Dumbledore
doesn
want
you
have
dreams
about
that
corridor
all
wouldn
have
asked
Snape
teach
you
Occlumency
You
just
going
have
work
bit
harder
your
lessons
working
said
Harry
nettled
You
try
some
time
Snape
trying
get
inside
your
head
not
bundle
laughs
you
know
Maybe
said
Ron
slowly
Maybe
what
said
Hermione
rather
snappishly
Maybe
not
Harry
fault
can
close
his
mind
said
Ron
darkly
What
you
mean
said
Hermione
Well
maybe
Snape
isn
really
trying
help
Harry
Harry
and
Hermione
stared
him
Ron
looked
darkly
and
meaningfully
from
one
the
other
Maybe

You

Ron
said
Hermione
angrily
How
many
times
have
you
suspected
Snape
and
when
have
youever
been
right
Dumbledore
trusts
him
works
for
the
Order
that
ought

Death

said
Ron
stubbornly
And
never

proof
that
hereally

sides
Dumbledore
trusts
him
Hermione
repeated
And
can
trust
Dumbledore
can
trust
anyone
With
much
worry
about
and
much
startling
amounts
homework
that
frequently
kept
the
fifth
years
working
until
past
midnight
secret
sessions
and
regular
classes
with
Snape
January
seemed
passing
alarmingly
fast
Before
Harry
knew
February
had
arrived
bringing
with
wetter
and
warmer
weather
and
the
prospect
the
second
Hogsmeade
visit
the
year
Harry
had
had
very
little
time
spare
for
conversations
with
Cho
since
they
had
agreed
visit
the
village
together
but
suddenly
found
himself
facing
Valentine
Day
spent
entirely
her
company
the
morning
the
fourteenth
dressed
particularly
carefully
and
Ron
arrived
breakfast
just
time
for
the
arrival
the
post
owls
Hedwig
was
not
there
not
that
Harry
had
expected
her
but
Hermione
was
tugging
letter
from
the
beak
unfamiliar
brown
owl
they
sat
down
And
about
time
hadn
come
today
she
said
eagerly
tearing
open
the
envelope
and
pulling
out
small
piece
parchment
Her
eyes
sped
from
left
right
she
read
through
the
message
and
grimly
pleased
expression
spread
across
her
face
Listen
Harry
she
said
looking
him
this
really
important
you
think
you
could
meet
the
Three
Broomsticks
around
midday
Well
dunno
said
Harry
uncertainly
Cho
might
expecting
spend
the
whole
day
with
her
never
said
what
were
going
Well
bring
her
along
you
must
said
Hermione
urgently
But
will
you
come
Well
all
right
but
why
haven
got
time
tell
you
now
got
answer
this
quickly
And
she
hurried
out
the
Great
Hall
the
letter
clutched
one
hand
and
piece
toast
the
other
Are
you
coming
Harry
asked
Ron
but
shook
his
head
looking
glum

come
into
Hogsmeade

Angelina
wants

Like
going

the
worst
team
ever
seen
You
should
see
Sloper

Kirke
they
pathetic
even
worse
than
heaved
great
sigh
dunno
why
Angelina
won
just
let
resign
because

Harry
irritably
found
very
hard

when
himself
would
have
given
almost
anything
playing
the
forthcoming
match
against
Hufflepuff
Ron
seemed
have
noticed
Harry
tone
because
did
not
mention
Quidditch
again
during
breakfast
and
there
was
slight
frostiness
the
way
they
said
goodbye
each
other
shortly
afterwards
Ron
departed
for
the
Quidditch
pitch
and
Harry
after
attempting
flatten
his
hair
while
staring
his
reflection
the
back
teaspoon
proceeded
alone
the
Entrance
Hall
meet
Cho
feeling
very
apprehensive
and
wondering
what
earth
they
were
going
talk
about
She
was
waiting
for
him
little
the
side
the
oak
front
doors
looking
very
pretty
with
her
hair
tied
back
long
pony
tail
Harry
feet
seemed
too
big
for
his
body
walked
towards
her
and
was
suddenly
horribly
aware
his
arms
and
how
stupid
they
must
look
swinging
his
sides
said
Cho
slightly
breathlessly
said
Harry
They
stared
each
other
for
moment
then
Harry
said
Well
shall
then
yes
They
joined
the
queue
people
being
signed
out
Filch
occasionally
catching
each
other
eye
and
grinning
shiftily
but
not
talking
each
other
Harry
was
relieved
when
they
reached
the
fresh
air
finding
easier
walk
along
silence
than
just
stand
about
looking
awkward
was
fresh
breezy
sort
day
and
they
passed
the
Quidditch
stadium
Harry
glimpsed
Ron
and
Ginny
skimming
along
over
the
stands
and
felt
horrible
pang
that
was
not
there
with
them
You
really
miss
don
you
said
Cho
looked
round
and
saw
her
watching
him
Yeah
sighed
Harry
Remember
the
first
time
played
against
each
other
the
third
year
she
asked
him
Yeah
said
Harry
grinning
You
kept
blocking
And
Wood
told
you
not
gentleman
and
knock
off
broom
you
had
said
Cho
smiling
reminiscently
heard
got
taken
Pride
Portree
that
right
Nah
was
Puddlemere
United
saw
him
the
World
Cup
last
year
saw
you
there
too
remember
were
the
same
campsite
was
really
good
wasn
The
subject
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
carried
them
all
the
way
down
the
drive
and
out
through
the
gates
Harry
could
hardly
believe
how
easy
was
talk
her
more
difficult
fact
than
talking
Ron
and
Hermione
and
was
just
starting
feel
confident
and
cheerful
when
large
gang
Slytherin
girls
passed
them
including
Pansy
Parkinson
Potter
and
Chang
screeched
Pansy
chorus
snide
giggles
Urgh
Chang
don
think
much
your
taste
least
Diggory
was
good
looking
The
girls
sped
talking
and
shrieking
pointed
fashion
with
many
exaggerated
glances
back
Harry
and
Cho
leaving
embarrassed
silence
their
wake
Harry
could
think
nothing
else
say
about
Quidditch
and
Cho
slightly
flushed
was
watching
her
feet
where
you
want
Harry
asked
they
entered
Hogsmeade
The
High
Street
was
full
students
ambling
and
down
peering
into
the
shop
windows
and
messing
about
together
the
pavements
don
mind
said
Cho
shrugging
Urn
shall
just
have
look
the
shops
something
They
wandered
towards
Dervish
and
Banges
large
poster
had
been
stuck
the
window
and
few
Hogsmeaders
were
looking
They
moved
aside
when
Harry
and
Cho
approached
and
Harry
found
himself
staring
once
more
the
pictures
the
ten
escaped
Death
Eaters
The
poster
Order
the
Ministry
Magic
offered
thousand
Galleon
reward
any
witch
wizard
with
information
leading
the
recapture
any
the
convicts
pictured
funny
isn
said
Cho
low
voice
gazing
the
pictures
the
Death
Eaters
remember
when
that
Sirius
Black
escaped
and
there
were
Dementors
all
over
Hogsmeade
looking
for
him
And
now
ten
Death
Eaters
are
the
loose
and
there
are
Dementors
anywhere
Yeah
said
Harry
tearing
his
eyes
away
from
Bellatrix
Lestrange
face
glance
and
down
the
High
Street
Yeah
that
weird
wasn
sorry
that
there
were
Dementors
nearby
but
now
came
think
their
absence
was
highly
significant
They
had
not
only
let
the
Death
Eaters
escape
they
weren
bothering
look
for
them
looked
though
they
really
were
outside
Ministry
control
now
The
ten
escaped
Death
Eaters
were
staring
out
every
shop
window
and
Cho
passed
started
rain
they
passed
Scrivenshaft
cold
heavy
drops
water
kept
hitting
Harry
face
and
the
back
his
neck
Urn
you
want
get
coffee
said
Cho
tentatively
the
rain
began
fall
more
heavily
Yeah
all
right
said
Harry
looking
around
Where
there
really
nice
place
just
here
haven
you
ever
been
Madam
Puddifoot
she
said
brightly
leading
him
side
road
and
into
small
teashop
that
Harry
had
never
noticed
before
was
cramped
steamy
little
place
where
everything
seemed
have
been
decorated
withfrills
bows
Harry
was
reminded
unpleasantly
Umbridge
office
Cute
isn
said
Cho
happily
yeah
said
Harry
untruthfully
Look
she
decorated
for
Valentine
Day
said
Cho
indicating
number
golden
cherubs
that
were
hovering
over
each
the
small
circular
tables
occasionally
throwing
pink
confetti
over
the
occupants
Aaah
They
sat
down
the
last
remaining
table
which
was
over
the
steamy
window
Roger
Davies
the
Ravenclaw
Quidditch
Captain
was
sitting
about
foot
and
half
away
with
pretty
blonde
girl
They
were
holding
hands
The
sight
made
Harry
feel
uncomfortable
particularly
when
looking
around
the
teashop
saw
that
was
full
nothing
but
couples
all
them
holding
hands
Perhaps
Cho
would
expect
him
holdher
hand
What
can
get
you
dears
said
Madam
Puddifoot
very
stout
woman
with
shiny
black
bun
squeezing
between
their
table
and
Roger
Davies
with
great
difficulty
Two
coffees
please
said
Cho
the
time
took
for
their
coffees
arrive
Roger
Davies
and
his
girlfriend
had
started
kissing
over
their
sugar
bowl
Harry
wished
they
wouldn
felt
that
Davies
was
setting
standard
with
which
Cho
would
soon
expect
him
compete
felt
his
face
growing
hot
and
tried
staring
out
the
window
but
was
steamed
couldn
see
the
street
outside
postpone
the
moment
when
would
have
look
Cho
stared
the
ceiling
though
examining
the
paintwork
and
received
handful
confetti
the
face
from
their
hovering
cherub
After
few
more
painful
minutes
Cho
mentioned
Umbridge
Harry
seized
the
subject
with
relief
and
they
passed
few
happy
moments
abusing
her
but
the
subject
had
already
been
thoroughly
canvassed
during
meetings
did
not
last
very
long
Silence
fell
again
Harry
was
very
conscious
the
slurping
noises
coming
from
the
table
next
door
and
cast
wildly
around
for
something
else
say
listen
you
want
come
with
the
Three
Broomsticks
lunchtime
meeting
Hermione
Granger
there
Cho
raised
her
eyebrows
You
meeting
Hermione
Granger
Today
Yeah
Well
she
asked
thought
would
you
want
come
with
She
said
wouldn
matter
you
did
well
that
was
nice
her
But
Cho
did
not
sound
though
she
thought
was
nice
all
the
contrary
her
tone
was
cold
and
all
sudden
she
looked
rather
forbidding
few
more
minutes
passed
total
silence
Harry
drinking
his
coffee
fast
that
would
soon
need
fresh
cup
Beside
them
Roger
Davies
and
his
girlfriend
seemed
glued
together
the
lips
Cho
hand
was
lying
the
table
beside
her
coffee
and
Harry
was
feeling
mounting
pressure
take
hold
Just
told
himself
fount
mingled
panic
and
excitement
surged
inside
his
chest
just
reach
out
and
grab
Amazing
how
much
more
difficult
was
extend
his
arm
twelve
inches
and
touch
her
hand
than
was
snatch
speeding
Snitch
from
midair
But
just
moved
his
hand
forwards
Cho
took
hers
off
the
table
She
was
now
watching
Roger
Davies
kissing
his
girlfriend
with
mildly
interested
expression
asked
out
you
know
she
said
quiet
voice
couple
weeks
ago
Roger
turned
him
down
though
Harry
who
had
grabbed
the
sugar
bowl
excuse
his
sudden
lunging
movement
across
the
table
could
not
think
why
she
was
telling
him
this
she
wished
she
were
sitting
the
next
table
being
heartily
kissed
Roger
Davies
why
had
she
agreed
come
out
with
him
said
nothing
Their
cherub
threw
another
handful
confetti
over
them
some
landed
the
last
cold
dregs
coffee
Harry
had
been
about
drink
came
here
with
Cedric
last
year
said
Cho
the
second
took
for
him
take
what
she
had
said
Harry
insides
had
become
glacial
could
not
believe
she
wanted
talk
about
Cedric
now
while
kissing
couples
surrounded
them
and
cherub
floated
over
their
heads
Cho
voice
was
rather
higher
when
she
spoke
again
been
meaning
ask
you
for
ages
did
Cedric
did
mention
all
before
died
This
was
the
very
last
subject
earth
Harry
wanted
discuss
and
least
all
with
Cho
Well
said
quietly
There
there
wasn
time
for
him
say
anything
Erm
you
you
get
see
lot
Quidditch
the
holidays
You
support
the
Tornados
right
His
voice
sounded
falsely
bright
and
cheery
his
horror
saw
that
her
eyes
were
swimming
with
tears
again
just
they
had
been
after
the
last
meeting
before
Christmas
Look
said
desperately
leaning
that
nobody
else
could
overhear
let
not
talk
about
Cedric
right
now
let
talk
about
something
else
But
this
apparently
was
quite
the
wrong
thing
say
thought
she
said
tears
spattering
down
the
table
thoughtyou
understand
Ineed
talk
about
Surely
you
need
talk
about
too
mean
you
saw
happen
didn
you
Everything
was
going
nightmarishly
wrong
Roger
Davies
girlfriend
had
even
unglued
herself
look
round
Cho
crying
Well
have
talked
about
Harry
said
whisper
Ron
and
Hermione
but
you
talk
Hermione
Granger
she
said
shrilly
her
face
now
shining
with
tears
Several
more
kissing
couples
broke
apart
stare
But
you
won
talk
perhaps
would
best
just
just
paid
and
you
went
and
met
with
Hermione
Granger
like
you
obviously
want
Harry
stared
her
utterly
bewildered
she
seized
frilly
napkin
and
dabbed
her
shining
face
with
Cho
said
weakly
wishing
Roger
would
seize
his
girlfriend
and
start
kissing
her
again
stop
her
goggling
him
and
Cho
leave
she
said
now
crying
into
the
napkin
don
know
why
you
asked
out
the
first
place
you
going
make
arrangements
meet
other
girls
right
after
how
many
are
you
meeting
after
Hermione
not
like
that
said
Harry
and
was
relieved
finally
understanding
what
she
was
annoyed
about
that
laughed
which
realised
split
second
too
late
was
also
mistake
Cho
sprang
her
feet
The
whole
tearoom
was
quiet
and
everybody
was
watching
them
now
see
you
around
Harry
she
said
dramatically
and
hiccoughing
slightly
she
dashed
the
door
wrenched
open
and
hurried
off
into
the
pouring
rain
Cho
Harry
called
after
her
but
the
door
had
already
swung
shut
behind
her
with
tuneful
tinkle
There
was
total
silence
within
the
teashop
Every
eye
was
Harry
threw
Galleon
down
the
table
shook
pink
confetti
out
his
hair
and
followed
Cho
out
the
door
was
raining
hard
now
and
she
was
nowhere
seen
simply
did
not
understand
what
had
happened
half
hour
ago
they
had
been
getting
along
fine
Women
muttered
angrily
sloshing
down
the
rain
washed
street
with
his
hands
his
pockets
What
did
she
want
talk
about
Cedric
for
anyway
Why
does
she
always
want
drag
subject
that
makes
her
act
like
human
hosepipe
turned
right
and
broke
into
splashy
run
and
within
minutes
was
turning
into
the
doorway
the
Three
Broomsticks
knew
was
too
early
meet
Hermione
but
thought
likely
there
would
someone
here
with
whom
could
spend
the
intervening
time
shook
his
wet
hair
out
his
eyes
and
looked
around
Hagrid
was
sitting
alone
corner
looking
morose
Hagrid
said
when
had
squeezed
through
the
crammed
tables
and
pulled
chair
beside
him
Hagrid
jumped
and
looked
down
Harry
though
barely
recognised
him
Harry
saw
that
had
two
fresh
cuts
his
face
and
several
new
bruises
yeh
Harry
said
Hagrid
Yeh
all
righ
Yeah
fine
lied
Harry
but
next
this
battered
and
mournful
looking
Hagrid
felt
didn
really
have
much

said
Hagrid
yeah
grand
Harry
grand
gazed
into
the
depths
his
pewter
tankard
which
was
the
size
large
bucket
and
sighed
Harry
didn
know
what
say
him
They
sat
side
side
silence
for
moment
Then
Hagrid
said
abruptly
the
same
boat
yeh

Arry
said
Harry
Yeah
said
before
both
outsiders
like
said
Hagrid
nodding
wisely
both
orphans
Yeah

tankard

Harry
cautiously
Hagrid
seemed
very
strange
mood
Family

Hagrid
gloomily
Whatever

And
wiped
trickle
out
his
eye
Hagrid
said
Harry
unable
stop
himself
where

all
these
injuries
said
Hagrid
looking
startled
Wha

All

Harry
pointing
Hagrid
face
tha
jus
normal
bumps

Harry
said
Hagrid
dismissively
got
rough
job
drained
his
tankard
set
back
the
table
and
got
his
feet
seein
yeh
Harry
take
care
now
And
lumbered
out
the
pub
looking
wretched
and
disappeared
into
the
torrential
rain
Harry
watched
him
feeling
miserable
Hagrid
was
unhappy
and
was
hiding
something
but
seemed
determined
not
accept
help
What
was
going
But
before
Harry
could
think
about
any
further
heard
voice
calling
his
name
Harry
Harry
over
here
Hermione
was
waving
him
from
the
other
side
the
room
got
and
made
his
way
towards
her
through
the
crowded
pub
was
still
few
tables
away
when
realised
that
Hermione
was
not
alone
She
was
sitting
table
with
the
unlikeliest
pair
drinking
mates
could
ever
have
imagined
Luna
Lovegood
and
none
other
than
Rita
Skeeter
journalist
theDaily
Prophet
and
one
Hermione
least
favourite
people
the
world
You

said
Hermione
moving
along
give
him
room
sit
down
thought
you
were
with
Cho
wasn
expecting
you
for
another
hour
least
Cho
said
Rita
once
twisting
round
her
seat
stare
avidly
Harry
girl
She
snatched
her
crocodile
skin
handbag
and
groped
within
none
ofyour
business
Harry
been
with
hundred
girls
Hermione
told
Rita
coolly
you
can
put
that
away
right
now
Rita
had
been
the
point
withdrawing
acid
green
quill
from
her
bag
Looking
though
she
had
been
forced
swallow
Stinksap
she
snapped
her
bag
shut
again
What
are

Harry
asked
sitting
down
and
staring
from
Rita
Luna
Hermione
Little
Miss
Perfect
was
just
about
tell
when
you
arrived
said
Rita
taking
large
slurp
her
drink
suppose

totalk
him
she
shot
Hermione
Yes
suppose
you
are
said
Hermione
coldly
Unemployment
did
not
suit
Rita
The
hair
that
had
once
been
set
elaborate
curls
now
hung
lank
and
unkempt
around
her
face
The
scarlet
paint
her
two
inch
talons
was
chipped
and
there
were
couple
false
jewels
missing
from
her
winged
glasses
She
took
another
great
gulp
her
drink
and
said
out
the
corner
her
mouth
Pretty
girl
she
Harry
One
more
word
about
Harry
love
life
and
the
deal
off
and
that
promise
said
Hermione
irritably
What

Rita
wiping
her
mouth
the
back
her
hand
You

mentioned

yet
Miss
Prissy

She
took
deep
shuddering
breath
Yes
yes

these
days

horrible
stories
about
Harry
and
said
Hermione
indifferently
Find
someone
who
cares
why
don
you
They
run
plenty
horrible
stories
about
Harry
this
year
without
help
said
Rita
shooting
sideways
look
him
over
the
top
her
glass
and
adding
rough
whisper
How
has
that
made
you
feel
Harry
Betrayed
Distraught
Misunderstood
feels
angry
course
said
Hermione
hard
clear
voice
Because

the
Minister
too
much
idiot
believe
him
you
actually
stick

Who
Must
Not
Named

said
Rita
lowering
her
glass
and
subjecting
Harry
piercing
stare
while
her
finger
strayed
longingly
the
clasp
the
crocodile
bag
You

Harry
There

dozen
odd

breathed
Rita
now
fumbling
her
bag
once
more
and
gazing
him
though
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
she
had
ever
seen
great
bold
headline
Potter
Accuses
sub
heading

And

The
Quick
Quotes
Quill
was
actually
her
hand
and
halfway
her
mouth
when
the
rapturous
expression
her
face
died
But
course
she
said
lowering
the
quill
and
looking
daggers
Hermione
Little
Miss
Perfect

want

she
matter
fact
said
Hermione
sweetly
that

Rita
stared
her
did
Harry
Luna
the
other
hand
sang
Weasley
our
King
dreamily
under
her
breath
and
stirred
her
drink
with
cocktail
onion
stick

contemptuously
throwing

across
the
table
for
the
sound
Voldemort

Rita
had
jumped
badly
she
had
slopped
half
her
glass
Firewhisky
down
herself
Rita
blotted
the
front
her
grubby
raincoat
still
staring
Hermione
Then
she
said
baldly
TheProphet

Luna
said
vaguely
that
she
did
not
know
how
soon
Rita
interview
with
Harry
would
appear
inThe
Quibbler
that
her
father
was
expecting
lovely
long
article
recent
sightings
Crumple
Horned
Snorkacks
and
course
that
very
important
story
Harry
might
have
wait
for
the
following
issue
said
Luna
Harry
had
not
found
easy
experience
talk
about
the
night
when
Voldemort
had
returned
Rita
had
pressed
him
for
every
little
detail
and
had
given
her
everything
could
remember
knowing
that
this
was
his
one
big
opportunity
tell
the
world
the
truth
wondered
how
people
would
react
the
story
guessed
that
would
confirm
lot
people
the
view
that
was
completely
insane
not
least
because
his
story
would
appearing
alongside
utter
rubbish
about
Crumple
Horned
Snorkacks
But
the
breakout
Bellatrix
Lestrange
and
her
fellow
Death
Eaters
had
given
Harry
burning
desire
something
whether
not
worked
Can
wait
see
what
Umbridge
thinks
you

Dean
sounding
awestruck

Monday
night
Seamus
was
shovelling
down
large
amounts
chicken
and
ham
pie
Dean
other
side
but
Harry
knew
was
listening
the
right
thing
Harry
said
Neville
who
was
sitting
opposite
him
was
rather
pale
but
went
low
voice
must
have
been
tough
talking
about
was
Yeah
mumbled
Harry
but
people
have
got
know
what
Voldemort
capable
haven
they
That
right
said
Neville
nodding
and
his
Death
Eaters
too
people
should
know
Neville
left
his
sentence
hanging
and
returned
his
baked
potato
Seamus
looked
but
when
caught
Harry
eye
looked
quickly
back
his
plate
again
After
while
Dean
Seamus
and
Neville
departed
for
the
common
room
leaving
Harry
and
Hermione
the
table
waiting
for
Ron
who
had
not
yet
had
dinner
because
Quidditch
practice
Cho
Chang
walked
into
the
Hall
with
her
friend
Marietta
Harry
stomach
gave
unpleasant
lurch
but
she
did
not
look
over
the
Gryffindor
table
and
sat
down
with
her
back
him
forgot
ask
you
said
Hermione
brightly
glancing
over
the
Ravenclaw
table
what
happened
your
date
with
Cho
How
come
you
were
back
early
well
was
said
Harry
pulling
dish
rhubarb
crumble
towards
him
and
helping
himself
seconds
complete
fiasco
now
you
mention
And
told
her
what
had
happened
Madam
Puddifoot
teashop
then
finished
several
minutes
later
the
final
bit
crumble
disappeared
she
jumps
right
and
says
see
you
around
Harry
and
runs
out
the
place
put
down
his
spoon
and
looked
Hermione
mean
what
was
all
that
about
What
was
going
Hermione
glanced
over
the
back
Cho
head
and
sighed
Harry
she
said
sadly
Well
sorry
but
you
were
bit
tactless
tactless
said
Harry
outraged
One
minute
were
getting
fine
next
minute
she
was
telling
that
Roger
Davies
asked
her
out
and
how
she
used
and
snog
Cedric
that
stupid
teashop
how
was
supposed
feel
about
that
Well
you
see
said
Hermione
with
the
patient
air
someone
explaining
that
one
plus
one
equals
two
over
emotional
toddler
you
shouldn
have
told
her
that
you
wanted
meet
halfway
through
your
date
But
but
spluttered
Harry
but
you
told
meet
you
twelve
and
bring
her
along
how
was
supposed
that
without
telling
her
You
should
have
told
her
differently
said
Hermione
still
with
that
maddeningly
patient
air
You
should
have
said
was
really
annoying
but
dmade
you
promise
come
along
the
Three
Broomsticks
and
you
really
didn
want
you
much
rather
spend
the
whole
day
with
her
but
unfortunately
you
thought
you
really
ought
meet
and
would
she
please
please
come
along
with
you
and
hopefully
you
able
get
away
more
quickly
And
might
have
been
good
idea
mention
how
ugly
you
think
too
Hermione
added
afterthought
But
don
think
you
ugly
said
Harry
bemused
Hermione
laughed
Harry
you
worse
than
Ron
well
you
not
she
sighed
Ron
himself
came
stumping
into
the
Hall
splattered
with
mud
and
looking
grumpy
Look
you
upset
Cho
when
you
said
you
were
going
meet
she
tried
make
you
jealous
was
her
way
trying
find
out
how
much
you
liked
her
that
what
she
was
doing
said
Harry
Ron
dropped
the
bench
opposite
them
and
pulled
every
dish
within
reach
towards
him
Well
wouldn
have
been
easier
she
just
asked
whether
liked
her
better
than
you
Girls
don
often
ask
questions
like
that
said
Hermione
Well
they
should
said
Harry
forcefully
Then
could
just
told
her
fancy
her
and
she
wouldn
have
had
get
herself
all
worked
again
about
Cedric
dying
not
saying
what
she
did
was
sensible
said
Hermione
Ginny
joined
them
just
muddy
Ron
and
looking
equally
disgruntled
just
trying
make
you
see
how
she
was
feeling
the
time
You
should
write
book
Ron
told
Hermione
cut
his
potatoes
translating
mad
things
girls
boys
can
understand
them
Yeah
said
Harry
fervently
looking
over
the
Ravenclaw
table
Cho
had
just
got
and
still
not
looking
him
she
left
the
Great
Hall
Feeling
rather
depressed
looked
back
Ron
and
Ginny
how
was
Quidditch
practice
was
nightmare
said
Ron
surly
voice
come
said
Hermione
looking
Ginny
sure
wasn
that
Yes
was
said
Ginny
was
appalling
Angelina
was
nearly
tears
the
end
Ron
and
Ginny
went
off
for
baths
after
dinner
Harry
and
Hermione
returned
the
busy
Gryffindor
common
room
and
their
usual
pile
homework
Harry
had
been
struggling
with
new
star
chart
for
Astronomy
for
half
hour
when
Fred
and
George
turned
Ron
and
Ginny
not
here
asked
Fred
looking
around
pulled
chair
and
when
Harry
shook
his
head
said
Good
were
watching
their
practice
They
going
slaughtered
They
complete
rubbish
without
Come
Ginny
not
bad
said
George
fairly
sitting
down
next
Fred
Actually
dunno
how
she
got
good
seeing
how
never
let
her
play
with
She
been
breaking
into
your
broom

the
garden
since
the
age
six
and
taking
each
your
brooms
out

when
you
weren
looking
said
Hermione
from
behind
her
tottering
pile
Ancient
Rune
books
said
George
looking
mildly
impressed
Well
that
explain
Has
Ron
saved
goal
yet
asked
Hermione
peering
over
the
top
ofMagical
Hieroglyphs
and
Logograms
Well
can
doesn
think
anyone
watching
him
said
Fred
rolling
his
eyes
all
have
ask
the
crowd
turn
their
backs
and
talk
among
themselves
every
time
the
Quaffle
goes
his
end
Saturday
got
again
and
moved
restlessly
the
window
staring
out
across
the
dark
grounds
You
know
Quidditch
was
about
the
only
thing
this
place
worth
staying
for
Hermione
cast
him
stern
look
You
got
exams
coming
Told
you
already
not
fussed
about
said
Fred
The
Snackboxes
are
ready

found
out
how
get
rid
those
boils
just
couple
drops
Murtlap
essence

them
Lee
put
George
yawned
widely
and
looked
out
disconsolately
the
cloudy
night
sky
dunno
even
want
watch
this
match
Zacharias
Smith
beats
might
have
kill
myself
Kill
him
more
like
said
Fred
firmly
That
the
trouble
with
Quidditch
said
Hermione
absent
mindedly
once
again
bent
over
her
Runes
translation
creates
all
this
bad
feeling
and
tension
between
the
houses
She
looked
find
her
copy
ofSpellman
Syllabary
and
caught
Fred
George
and
Harry
all
staring
her
with
expressions
mingled
disgust
and
incredulity
their
faces
Well
does
she
said
impatiently
only
game
isn
Hermione
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
you
good
feelings
and
stuff
but
you
just
don
understand
about
Quidditch
Maybe
not
she
said
darkly
returning
her
translation
but
least
happiness
doesn
depend
Ron
goalkeeping
ability
And
though
Harry
would
rather
have
jumped
off
the
Astronomy
Tower
than
admit
her
the
time
had
watched
the
game
the
following
Saturday
would
have
given
any
number
Galleons
not
care
about
Quidditch
either
The
very
best
thing
you
could
say
about
the
match
was
that
was
short
the
Gryffindor
spectators
had
endure
only
twenty
two
minutes
agony
was
hard
say
what
the
worst
thing
was
Harry
thought
was
close
run
contest
between
Ron
fourteenth
failed
save
Sloper
missing
the
Bludger
but
hitting
Angelina
the
mouth
with
his
bat
and
Kirke
shrieking
and
falling
backwards
off
his
broom
when
Zacharias
Smith
zoomed
him
carrying
the
Quaffle
The
miracle
was
that
Gryffindor
only
lost
ten
points
Ginny
managed
snatch
the
Snitch
from
right
under
Hufflepuff
Seeker
Summerby
nose
that
the
final
score
was
two
hundred
and
forty
versus
two
hundred
and
thirty
Good
catch
Harry
told
Ginny
back
the
common
room
where
the
atmosphere
resembled
that
particularly
dismal
funeral
was
lucky
she
shrugged
wasn
very
fast
Snitch
and
Summerby
got
cold
sneezed
and
closed
his
eyes
exactly
the
wrong
moment
Anyway
once
you
back
the
team
Ginny
got
alifelong
ban
You
banned
long
Umbridge
the
school
Ginny
corrected
him
There

Anyway
once
you
back

try
out
for
Chaser
Angelina
and
Alicia
are
both
leaving
next
year
and
prefer
goal

Seeking

Harry
looked
over
Ron
who
was
hunched
corner
staring
his
knees
bottle
Butterbeer
clutched
his
hand
Angelina
still
won
let
him
resign
Ginny
said
though
reading
Harry
mind
She
says
she
knows
got
him
Harry
liked
Angelina
for
the
faith
she
was
showing
Ron
but
the
same
time
thought
would
really
kinder
let
him
leave
the
team
Ron
had
left
the
pitch
another
booming
chorus
Weasley
our
King
sung
with
great
gusto
the
Slytherins
who
were
now
favourites
win
the
Quidditch
Cup
Fred
and
George
wandered
over
haven
even
got
the
heart
take
the
mickey
out
him
said
Fred
looking
over
Ron
crumpled
figure
Mind
you
when
missed
the
fourteenth
made
wild
motions
with
his
arms
though
doing
upright
doggy
paddle
well
save
for
parties
Ron
dragged
himself
bed
shortly
after
this
Out
respect
for
his
feelings
Harry
waited
while
before
going
the
dormitory
himself
that
Ron
could
pretend

Sure
enough
when
Harry
finally
entered
the
room
Ron
was
snoring
little
too
loudly
entirely

Harry
got
into

about

had
been

Ginny
hadn

she

Gryffindor
Umbridge
had
been
sitting
few
rows
below
Harry
and
Hermione
Once
twice
she
had
turned
squatly
her
seat
look
him
her
wide
toad
mouth
stretched
what
thought
had
been
gloating
smile
The
memory
made
him
feel
hot
with
anger
lay
there
the
dark
After
few
minutes
however
remembered
that

supposed
emptying
his
mind
all

merely
increased

instead
how

the

Slowly
Ron
snores
died
away
replaced
the
sound
deep
slow
breathing
took
Harry
much
longer
get
sleep
his
body
was
tired
but
took
his
brain
long
time
close
down
dreamed
that
Neville
and
Professor
Sprout
were
waltzing
around
the
Room
Requirement
while
Professor
McGonagall
played
the
bagpipes
watched
them
happily
for
while
then
decided
and

other

the
But
when
left
the
room
found
himself
facing
not
the

burning
its
bracket
stone
wall
turned
his
head
slowly
the
left
There
the
far
end
the
windowless
passage
was
plain
black
door
walked
towards
with
sense
mounting
excitement
had
the
strangest
feeling
that
this
time
was
going
get
lucky
last
and
find
the
way
open
was
feet
from
and
saw
with
leap
excitement
that
there
was
glowing
strip
faint
blue
light
down
the
right
hand
side
the
door
was
ajar
stretched
out
his
hand
push
wide
and
Ron
gave
loud
rasping
genuine
snore
and
Harry
awoke
abruptly
with
his
right
hand
stretched
front
him
the
darkness
open
door
that
was
hundreds
miles
away
let
fall
with
feeling
mingled
disappointment
and
guilt
knew
should
not
have
seen
the
door
but
the
same
time
felt
consumed
with
curiosity
about
what
was
behind
that
could
not
help
feeling
annoyed
with
Ron
only
could
have
saved
his
snore
for
just
another
minute
They
entered
the
Great
Hall
for
breakfast
exactly
the
same
moment
the
post
owls
Monday
morning
Hermione
was
not
the
only
person
eagerly
awaiting
herDaily
Prophet
nearly
everyone
was
eager
for
more
news
about
the
escaped
Death
Eaters
who
despite
many
reported
sightings
had
still
not
been
caught
She
gave
the
delivery
owl
Knut
and
unfolded
the
newspaper
eagerly
while
Harry
helped
himself
orange
juice
had
only
received
one
note
during
the
entire
year
was
sure
when
the
first
owl
landed
with
thud
front
him
that
had
made
mistake
Who
you
after
asked
languidly
removing
his
orange
juice
from
underneath
its
beak
and
leaning
forwards
see
the
recipient
name
and
address
Harry
Potter
Great
Hall
Hogwarts
School
Frowning
made
take
the
letter
from
the
owl
but
before
could
three
four
five
more
owls
had
fluttered
down
beside
and
were
jockeying
for
position
treading
the
butter
and
knocking
over
the
salt
each
one
attempted
give
him
their
letter
first
What
going
Ron
asked
amazement
the
whole
Gryffindor
table
leaned
forwards
watch
and
another
seven
owls
landed
amongst
the
first
ones
screeching
hooting
and
flapping
their
wings
Harry
said
Hermione
breathlessly
plunging
her
hands
into
the
feathery
mass
and
pulling
out
screech
owl
bearing
long
cylindrical
package
think
know
what
this
means
open
this
one
first
Harry
ripped
off
the
brown
packaging
Out
rolled
tightly
furled
copy
the
March
edition
ofThe
Quibbler
unrolled
see
his
own
face
grinning
sheepishly
him
from
the
front
cover
large
red
letters
across
this
picture
were
the
words
HARRY
POTTER
SPEAKS
OUT
LAST
THE
TRUTH
ABOUT
WHO
MUST
NOT
NAMED
AND
THE
NIGHT
SAW
HIM
RETURN
good
isn
said
Luna
who
had
drifted
over
the
Gryffindor
table
and
now
squeezed
herself
the
bench
between
Fred
and
Ron
came
out
yesterday
asked
Dad
send
you
free
copy
expect
all
these
she
waved
hand
the
assembled
owls
still
scrabbling
around
the
table
front
Harry
are
letters
from
readers
That
what
thought
said
Hermione
eagerly
Harry
you
mind
Help
yourself
said
Harry
feeling
slightly
bemused
Ron
and
Hermione
both
started
ripping
open
envelopes
This
one
from
bloke
who
thinks
you
off
your
rocker
said
Ron
glancing
down
his
letter
well
This
woman
recommends
you
try
good
course
Shock
Spells
Mungo
said
Hermione
looking
disappointed
and
crumpling
second
This
one
looks
though
said
Harry
slowly
scanning
long
letter
from
witch
Paisley
Hey
she
says
she
believes
This
one
two
minds
said
Fred
who
had
joined
the
letter
opening
with
enthusiasm
Says
you
don
come
across
mad
person
but
really
doesn
want
believe
You
Know
Who
back
doesn
know
what
think
now
Blimey
what
waste
parchment
Here
another
one
you
convinced
Harry
said
Hermione
excitedly
Having
read
your
side
the
story
forced
the
conclusion
that
theDaily
Prophet
has
treated
you
very
unfairly
little
though
want
think
that
Who
Must
Not
Named
has
returned
forced
accept
that
you
are
telling
the
truth
this
wonderful
Another
one
who
thinks
you
barking
said
Ron
throwing
crumpled
letter
over
his
shoulder
but
this
one
says
you
got
her
converted
and
she
now
thinks
you
real
hero
she
put
photograph
too
wow
What
going
here
said
falsely
sweet
girlish
voice
Harry
looked
with
his
hands
full
envelopes
Professor
Umbridge
was
standing
behind
Fred
and
Luna
her
bulging
toad
eyes
scanning
the
mess
owls
and
letters
the
table
front
Harry
Behind
her
saw
many
the
students
watching
them
avidly
Why
have
you
got
all
these
letters
Potter
she
asked
slowly
that
crime
now
said
Fred
loudly
Getting
mail
careful
Weasley
shall
have
put
you
detention
said
Umbridge
Well
Potter
Harry
hesitated
but
did
not
see
how
could
keep
what
had
done
quiet
was
surely
only
matter
time
before
copy
ofThe
Quibbler
came
Umbridge
attention
People
have
written
because
gave
interview
said
Harry
About
what
happened
last
June
For
some
reason
glanced
the
staff
table
said
this
Harry
had
the
strangest
feeling
that
Dumbledore
had
been
watching
him
second
before
but
when
looked
towards
the
Headmaster
seemed
absorbed
conversation
with
Professor
Flitwick
interview
repeated
Umbridge
her
voice
thinner
and
higher
than
ever
What
you
mean
mean
reporter
asked
questions
and
answered
them
said
Harry
Here
And
threw
the
copy
ofThe
Quibbler
her
She
caught
and
stared
down
the
cover
Her
pale
doughy
face
turned
ugly
patchy
violet
When
did
you
this
she
asked
her
voice
trembling
slightly
Last
Hogsmeade
weekend
said
Harry
She
looked
him
incandescent
with
rage
the
magazine
shaking
her
stubby
fingers
There
will
more
Hogsmeade
trips
for
you
Potter
she
whispered
How
you
dare
how
you
could
She
took
deep
breath
have
tried
again
and
again
teach
you
not
tell
lies
The
message
apparently
has
still
not
sunk
Fifty
points
from
Gryffindor
and
another
week
worth
detentions
She
stalked
away
clutchingThe
Quibbler
her
chest
the
eyes
many
students
following
her
mid
morning
enormous
signs
had
been
put
all
over
the
school
not
just
house
noticeboards
but
the
corridors
and
classrooms
too
ORDER
THE
HIGH
INQUISITOR
HOGWARTS
Any
student
found
possession
the
magazineThe
Quibbler
will
expelled
The
above
accordance
with
Educational
Decree
Number
Twenty
seven
Signed
Dolores
Jane
Umbridge
High
Inquisitor
For
some
reason
every
time
Hermione
caught
sight
one
these
signs
she
beamed
with
pleasure
What
exactly
are
you
happy
about
Harry
asked
her
Harry
don
you
see
Hermione
breathed
she
could
have
done
one
thing
make
absolutely
sure
that
every
single
person
this
school
will
read
your
interview
was
banning
And
seemed
that
Hermione
was
quite
right
the
end
the
day
though
Harry
had
not
seen
much
corner
ofThe
Quibbler
anywhere
the
school
the
whole
place
seemed
quoting
the
interview
each
other
Harry
heard
them
whispering
about
they
queued
outside
classes
discussing
over
lunch
and
the
back
lessons
while
Hermione
even
reported
that
every
occupant
the
cubicles
the
girls
toilets
had
been
talking
about
when
she
nipped
there
before
Ancient
Runes
Then
they
spotted
and
obviously
they
know
know
you
they
bombarded
with
questions
Hermione
told
Harry
her
eyes
shining
and
Harry
think
they
believe
you
really
think
you
finally
got
them
convinced
Meanwhile
Professor
Umbridge
was
stalking
the
school
stopping
students
random
and
demanding
that
they
turn
out
their
books
and
pockets
Harry
knew
she
was
looking
for
copies
ofThe
Quibbler
but
the
students
were
several
steps
ahead
her
The
pages
carrying
Harry
interview
had
been
bewitched
resemble
extracts
from
textbooks
anyone
but
themselves
read
else
wiped
magically
blank
until
they
wanted
peruse
again
Soon
seemed
that
every
single
person
the
school
had
read
The
teachers
were
course
forbidden
from
mentioning
the
interview
Educational
Decree
Number
Twenty
six
but
they
found
ways
express
their
feelings
about
all
the
same
Professor
Sprout
awarded
Gryffindor
twenty
points
when
Harry
passed
her
watering
can
beaming
Professor
Flitwick
pressed
box
squeaking
sugar
mice
him
the
end
Charms
said
Shh
and
hurried
away
and
Professor
Trelawney
broke
into
hysterical
sobs
during
Divination
and
announced
the
startled
class
and
very
disapproving
Umbridge
that
Harry
wasnot
going
suffer
early
death
after
all
but
would
live
ripe
old
age
become
Minister
for
Magic
and
have
twelve
children
But
what
made
Harry
happiest
was
Cho
catching
with
him
was
hurrying
along
Transfiguration
the
next
day
Before
knew
what
had
happened
her
hand
was
his
and
she
was
breathing
his
ear
really
really
sorry
That
interview
was
brave
made
cry
was
sorry
hear
she
had
shed
even
more
tears
over
but
very
glad
they
were
speaking
terms
again
and
even
more
pleased
when
she
gave
him
swift
kiss
the
cheek
and
hurried
off
again
And
unbelievably
sooner
had
arrived
outside
Transfiguration
than
something
just
good
happened
Seamus
stepped
out
the
queue
face
him
just
wanted
say
mumbled
squinting
Harry
left
knee
believe
you
And
sent
copy
that
magazine
mam
anything
more
was
needed
complete
Harry
happiness
was
the
reaction
got
from
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
saw
them
with
their
heads
together
later
that
afternoon
the
library
they
were
with
weedy
looking
boy
Hermione
whispered
was
called
Theodore
Nott
They
looked
round
Harry
browsed
the
shelves
for
the
book
needed
Partial
Vanishment
Goyle
cracked
his
knuckles
threateningly
and
Malfoy
whispered
something
undoubtedly
malevolent
Crabbe
Harry
knew
perfectly
well
why
they
were
acting
like
this
had
named
all
their
fathers
Death
Eaters
And
the
best
bit
whispered
Hermione
gleefully
they
left
the
library
they
can
contradict
you
because
they
can
admit
they
read
the
article
cap
all
Luna
told
him
over
dinner
that
issue
ofThe
Quibbler
had
ever
sold
out
faster
Dad
reprinting
she
told
Harry
her
eyes
popping
excitedly
can
believe
says
people
seem
even
more
interested
this
than
the
Crumple
Horned
Snorkacks
Harry
was
hero
the
Gryffindor
common
room
that
night
Daringly
Fred
and
George
had
put
Enlargement
Charm
the
front
cover
ofThe
Quibbler
and
hung
the
wall
that
Harry
giant
head
gazed
down
upon
the
proceedings
occasionally
saying
things
like
THE
MINISTRY
ARE
MORONS
and
EAT
DUNG
UMBRIDGE
booming
voice
Hermione
did
not
find
this
very
amusing
she
said
interfered
with
her
concentration
and
she
ended
going
bed
early
out
irritation
Harry
had
admit
that
the
poster
was
not
quite
funny
after
hour
two
especially
when
the
talking
spell
had
started
wear
off
that
merely
shouted
disconnected
words
like
DUNG
and
UMBRIDGE
more
and
more
frequent
intervals
progressively
higher
voice
fact
started
make
his
head
ache
and
his
scar
began
prickling
uncomfortably
again
disappointed
moans
from
the
many
people
who
were
sitting
around
him
asking
him
relive
his
interview
for
the
umpteenth
time
announced
that
too
needed
early
night
The
dormitory
was
empty
when
reached
rested
his
forehead
for
moment
against
the
cool
glass
the
window
beside
his
bed
felt
soothing
against
his
scar
Then
undressed
and
got
into
bed
wishing
his
headache
would
away
also
felt
slightly
sick
rolled
over
his
side
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
almost
once
was
standing
dark
curtained
room
lit
single
branch
candles
His
hands
were
clenched
the
back
chair
front
him
They
were
long
fingered
and
white
though
they
had
not
seen
sunlight
for
years
and
looked
like
large
pale
spiders
against
the
dark
velvet
the
chair
Beyond
the
chair
pool
light
cast
upon
the
floor
the
candles
knelt
man
black
robes
have
been
badly
advised
seems
said
Harry
high
cold
voice
that
pulsed
with
anger
Master
crave
your
pardon
croaked
the
man
kneeling
the
floor
The
back
his
head
glimmered
the
candlelight
seemed
trembling
not
blame
you
Rookwood
said
Harry
that
cold
cruel
voice
relinquished
his
grip
the
chair
and
walked
around
closer
the
man
cowering
the
floor
until
stood
directly
over
him
the
darkness
looking
down
from
far
greater
height
than
usual
You
are
sure
your
facts
Rookwood
asked
Harry
Yes
Lord
yes
used
work
the
Department
after
after
all
Avery
told
Bode
would
able
remove
Bode
could
never
have
taken
Master
Bode
would
have
known
could
not
undoubtedly
that
why
fought
hard
against
Malfoy
Imperius
Curse
Stand
Rookwood
whispered
Harry
The
kneeling
man
almost
fell
over
his
haste
obey
His
face
was
pockmarked
the
scars
were
thrown
into
relief
the
candlelight
remained
little
stooped
when
standing
though
halfway
through
bow
and
darted
terrified
looks
Harry
face
You
have
done
well
tell
this
said
Harry
Very
well
have
wasted
months
fruitless
schemes
seems
but
matter
begin
again
from
now
You
have
Lord
Voldemort
gratitude
Rookwood
Lord
yes
Lord
gasped
Rookwood
his
voice
hoarse
with
relief
shall
need
your
help
shall
need
all
the
information
you
can
give
course
Lord
course
anything
Very
well
you
may
Send
Avery
Rookwood
scurried
backwards
bowing
and
disappeared
through
door
Left
alone
the
dark
room
Harry
turned
towards
the
wall
cracked
age
spotted
mirror
hung
the
wall
the
shadows
Harry
moved
towards
His
reflection
grew
larger
and
clearer
the
darkness
face
whiter
than
skull
red
eyes
with
slits
for
pupils
NOOOOOOOOO
What
yelled
voice
nearby
Harry
flailed
around
madly
became
entangled
the
hangings
and
fell
out
his
bed
For
few
seconds
did
not
know
where
was
was
convinced
was
about
see
the
white
skull
like
face
looming
him
out
the
dark
again
then
very
near
him
Ron
voice
spoke
Will
you
stop
acting
like
maniac
can
get
you
out
here
Ron
wrenched
the
hangings
apart
and
Harry
stared
him
the
moonlight
flat
his
back
his
scar
searing
with
pain
Ron
looked
though
had
just
been
getting
ready
for
bed
one
arm
was
out
his
robes
Has
someone
been
attacked
again
asked
Ron
pulling
Harry
roughly
his
feet
Dad
that
snake
everyone
fine
gasped
Harry
whose
forehead
felt
though
were
fire
Well
Avery
isn
trouble
gave
him
the
wrong
information
Voldemort
really
angry
Harry
groaned
and
sank
shaking
his
bed
rubbing
his
scar
But
Rookwood
going
help
him
now
the
right
track
again
What
are
you
talking
about
said
Ron
sounding
scared
you
mean
did
you
just
see
You
Know
Who
was
You
Know
Who
said
Harry
and
stretched
out
his
hands
the
darkness
and
held
them
his
face
check
that
they
were
longer
deathly
white
and
long
fingered
was
with
Rookwood
one
the
Death
Eaters
who
escaped
from
Azkaban
remember
Rookwood
just
told
him
Bode
couldn
have
done
Done
what
Remove
something
said
Bode
would
have
known
couldn
have
done
Bode
was
under
the
Imperius
Curse
think
said
Malfoy
dad
put
him
Bode
was
bewitched
remove
something
Ron
said
But
Harry
that
got
The
weapon
Harry
finished
the
sentence
for
him
know
The
dormitory
door
opened
Dean
and
Seamus
came
Harry
swung
his
legs
back
into
bed
did
not
want
look
though
anything
odd
had
just
happened
seeing
Seamus
had
only
just
stopped
thinking
Harry
was
nutter
Did
you
say
murmured
Ron
putting
his
head
close
Harry
the
pretence
helping
himself
water
from
the
jug
his
bedside
table
that
youwere
You
Know
Who
Yeah
said
Harry
quietly
Ron
took
unnecessarily
large
gulp
water
Harry
saw
spill
over
his
chin
his
chest
Harry
said
Dean
and
Seamus
clattered
around
noisily
pulling
off
their
robes
and
talking
you
got
tell
haven
got
tell
anyone
said
Harry
shortly
wouldn
have
seen
all
could
Occlumency
supposed
have
learned
shut
this
stuff
out
That
what
they
want
they
meant
Dumbledore
got
back
into
bed
and
rolled
over
his
side
with
his
back
Ron
and
after
while
heard
Ron
mattress
creak
too
lay
back
down
Harry
scar
began
burn
bit
hard
his
pillow
stop
himself
making
noise
Somewhere
knew
Avery
wasbeing
punished
Harry
and
Ron
waited
until
break
next
morning
tell
Hermione
exactly
what
had
happened
they
wanted
absolutely
sure
they
could
not
overheard
Standing
their
usual
corner
the
cool
and
breezy
courtyard
Harry
told
her
every
detail
the
dream
could
remember
When
had
finished
she
said
nothing
all
for
few
moments
but
stared
with
kind
painful
intensity
Fred
and
George
who
were
both
headless
and
selling
their
magical
hats
from
under
their
cloaks
the
other
side
the
yard
that
why
they
killed
him
she
said
quietly
withdrawing
her
gaze
from
Fred
and
George
last
When
Bode
tried
steal
this
weapon
something
funny
happened
him
think
there
must
defensive
spells
around
stop
people
touching
That
why
was
Mungo
his
brain
had
gone
all
funny
and
couldn
talk
But
remember
what
the
Healer
told
was
recovering
And
they
couldn
risk
him
getting
better
could
they
mean
the
shock
whatever
happened
when
touched
that
weapon
probably
made
the
Imperius
Curse
lift
Once
got
his
voice
back
explain
what
been
doing
wouldn
They
would
have
known
been
sent
steal
the
weapon
course
would
have
been
easy
for
Lucius
Malfoy
put
the
curse
him
Never
out
the
Ministry
was
even
hanging
around
that
day
had
hearing
said
Harry
the
hang
said
slowly
was
the
Department
Mysteries
corridor
that
day
Your
dad
said
was
probably
trying
sneak
down
and
find
out
what
happened
hearing
but
what
Sturgis
gasped
Hermione
looking
thunderstruck
Sorry
said
Ron
looking
bewildered
Sturgis
Podmore
said
Hermione
breathlessly
arrested
for
trying
get
through
door
Lucius
Malfoy
must
have
got
him
too
bet
did
the
day
you
saw
him
there
Harry
Sturgis
had
Moody
Invisibility
Cloak
right
what
was
standing
guard
the
door
invisible
and
Malfoy
heard
him
move
guessed
someone
was
there
just
did
the
Imperius
Curse
the
off
chance
there
guard
there
when
Sturgis
next
had
opportunity
probably
when
was
his
turn
guard
duty
again
tried
get
into
the
Department
steal
the
weapon
for
Voldemort
Ron
quiet
but
got
caught
and
sent
Azkaban
She
gazed
Harry
And
now
Rookwood
told
Voldemort
how
get
the
weapon
didn
hear
all
the
conversation
but
that
what
sounded
like
said
Harry
Rookwood
used
work
there
maybe
Voldemort
send
Rookwood
Hermione
nodded
apparently
still
lost
thought
Then
quite
abruptly
she
said
But
you
shouldn
have
seen
this
all
Harry
What
said
taken
aback
You
supposed
learning
how
close
your
mind
this
sort
thing
said
Hermione
suddenly
stern
know
said
Harry
But
Well
think
should
just
try
and
forget
what
you
saw
said
Hermione
firmly
And
you
ought
put
bit
more
effort
your
Occlumency
from
now
Harry
was
angry
with
her
did
not
talk
her
for
the
rest
the
day
which
proved
another
bad
one
When
people
were
not
discussing
the
escaped
Death
Eaters
the
corridors
they
were
laughing
Gryffindor
abysmal
performance
their
match
against
Hufflepuff
the
Slytherins
were
singing
Weasley
our
King
loudly
and
frequently
that
sundown
Filch
had
banned
from
the
corridors
out
sheer
irritation
The
week
did
not
improve
progressed
Harry
received
two
more
Potions
was
still
tenterhooks
that
Hagrid
might
get
the
sack
and
couldn
stop
himself
dwelling
the
dream
which
had
been
Voldemort
though
didn
bring
with
Ron
and
Hermione
again
didn
want
another
telling
off
from
Hermione
wished
very
much
that
could
have
talked
Sirius
about
but
that
was
out
the
question
tried
push
the
matter
the
back
his
mind
Unfortunately
the
back
his
mind
was
longer
the
secure
place
had
once
been
Get
Potter
couple
weeks
after
his
dream
Rookwood
Harry
was
found
yet
again
kneeling
the
floor
Snape
office
trying
clear
his
head
had
just
been
forced
yet
again
relive
stream
very
early
memories
had
not
even
realised
still
had
most
them
concerning
humiliations
Dudley
and
his
gang
had
inflicted
upon
him
primary
school
That
last
memory
said
Snape
What
was
don
know
said
Harry
getting
wearily
his
feet
was
finding
increasingly
difficult
disentangle
separate
memories
from
the
rush
images
and
sound
that
Snape
kept
calling
forth
You
mean
the
one
where
cousin
tried
make
stand
the
toilet
said
Snape
softly
mean
the
one
with
man
kneeling
the
middle
darkened
room
nothing
said
Harry
Snape
dark
eyes
bored
into
Harry
Remembering
what
Snape
had
said
about
eye
contact
being
crucial
Legilimency
Harry
blinked
and
looked
away
How
that
man
and
that
room
come
inside
your
head
Potter
said
Snape
said
Harry
looking
everywhere
but
Snape
was
just
dream
had
dream
repeated
Snape
There
was
pause
during
which
Harry
stared
fixedly
large
dead
frog
suspended
jar
purple
liquid
You
know
why
are
here
don
you
Potter
said
Snape
low
dangerous
voice
You
know
why
giving
evenings
this
tedious
job
Yes
said
Harry
stiffly
Remind
why
are
here
Potter
can
learn
Occlumency
said
Harry
now
glaring
dead
eel
Correct
Potter
And
dim
though
you
may
Harry
looked
back
Snape
hating
him
would
have
thought
that
after
over
two
months
lessons
you
might
have
made
some
progress
How
many
other
dreams
about
the
Dark
Lord
have
you
had
Just
that
one
lied
Harry
Perhaps
said
Snape
his
dark
cold
eyes
narrowing
slightly
perhaps
you
actually
enjoy
having
these
visions
and
dreams
Potter
Maybe
they
make
you
feel
special
important
they
don
said
Harry
his
jaw
set
and
his
fingers
clenched
tightly
around
the
handle
his
wand
That
just
well
Potter
said
Snape
coldly
because
you
are
neither
special
nor
important
and
not
you
find
out
what
the
Dark
Lord
saying
his
Death
Eaters
that
your
job
isn
Harry
shot
him
had
not
meant
say
had
burst
out
him
temper
For
long
moment
they
stared
each
other
Harry
convinced
had
gone
too
far
But
there
was
curious
almost
satisfied
expression
Snape
face
when
answered
Yes
Potter
said
his
eyes
glinting
That
job
Now
you
are
ready
will
start
again
raised
his
wand
One
two
three
Legilimens
hundred
Dementors
were
swooping
towards
Harry
across
the
lake
the
grounds
screwed
his
face
concentration
they
were
coming
closer
could
see
the
dark
holes
beneath
their
hoods
yet
could
also
see
Snape
standing
front
him
his
eyes
fixed
Harry
face
muttering
under
his
breath
and
somehow
Snape
was
growing
clearer
and
the
Dementors
were
growing
fainter
Harry
raised
his
own
wand
Protego
Snape
staggered
his
wand
flew
upwards
away
from
Harry
and
suddenly
Harry
mind
was
teeming
with
memories
that
were
not
his
hook
nosed
man
was
shouting
cowering
woman
while
small
dark
haired
boy
cried
corner
greasy
haired
teenager
sat
alone
dark
bedroom
pointing
his
wand
the
ceiling
shooting
down
flies
girl
was
laughing
scrawny
boy
tried
mount
bucking
broomstick
ENOUGH
Harry
felt
though
had
been
pushed
hard
the
chest
staggered
several
steps
backwards
hit
some
the
shelves
covering
Snape
walls
and
heard
something
crack
Snape
was
shaking
slightly
and
was
very
white
the
face
The
back
Harry
robes
was
damp
One
the
jars
behind
him
had
broken
when
fell
against
the
pickled
slimy
thing
within
was
swirling
its
draining
potion
Reparo
hissed
Snape
and
the
jar
sealed
itself
once
Well
Potter
that
was
certainly
improvement
Panting
slightly
Snape
straightened
the
Pensieve
which
had
again
stored
some
his
thoughts
before
starting
the
lesson
almost
though
was
checking
they
were
still
there
don
remember
telling
you
use
Shield
Charm
but
there
doubt
that
was
effective
Harry
did
not
speak
felt
that
say
anything
might
dangerous
was
sure
had
just
broken
into
Snape
memories
that
had
just
seen
scenes
from
Snape
childhood
was
unnerving
think
that
the
little
boy
who
had
been
crying
watched
his
parents
shouting
was
actually
standing
front
him
with
such
loathing
his
eyes
Let
try
again
shall
said
Snape
Harry
felt
thrill
dread
was
about
pay
for
what
had
just
happened
was
sure
They
moved
back
into
position
with
the
desk
between
them
Harry
feeling
was
going
find
much
harder
empty
his
mind
this
time
the
count
three
then
said
Snape
raising
his
wand
once
more
One
two
Harry
did
not
have
time
gather
himself
together
and
attempt
clear
his
mind
before
Snape
cried
Legilimens
was
hurtling
along
the
corridor
towards
the
Department
Mysteries
past
the
blank
stone
walls
past
the
torches
the
plain
black
door
was
growing
ever
larger
was
moving
fast
was
going
collide
with
was
feet
from
and
again
could
see
that
chink
faint
blue
light
The
door
had
flown
open
was
through
last
inside
black
walled
black
floored
circular
room
lit
with
blue
flamed
candles
and
there
were
more
doors
all
around
him
needed
but
which
door
ought
take
POTTER
Harry
opened
his
eyes
was
flat
his
back
again
with
memory
having
got
there
was
also
panting
though
really
had
run
the
length
the
Department
Mysteries
corridor
really
had
sprinted
through
the
black
door
and
found
the
circular
room
Explain
yourself
said
Snape
who
was
standing
over
him
looking
furious
dunno
what
happened
said
Harry
truthfully
standing
There
was
lump
the
back
his
head
from
where
had
hit
the
ground
and
felt
feverish
never
seen
that
before
mean
told
you
dreamed
about
the
door
but
never
opened
before
You
are
not
working
hard
enough
For
some
reason
Snape
seemed
even
angrier
than
had
done
two
minutes
before
when
Harry
had
seen
into
his
teacher
memories
You
are
lazy
and
sloppy
Potter
small
wonder
that
the
Dark
Lord
Can
you
tell
something
sir
said
Harry
firing
again
Why
you
call
Voldemort
the
Dark
Lord
only
ever
heard
Death
Eaters
call
him
that
Snape
opened
his
mouth
snarl
and
woman
screamed
from
somewhere
outside
the
room
Snape
head
jerked
upwards
was
gazing
the
ceiling
What
the
muttered
Harry
could
hear
muffled
commotion
coming
from
what
thought
might
the
Entrance
Hall
Snape
looked
round
him
frowning
Did
you
see
anything
unusual
your
way
down
here
Potter
Harry
shook
his
head
Somewhere
above
them
the
woman
screamed
again
Snape
strode
his
office
door
his
wand
still
held
the
ready
and
swept
out
sight
Harry
hesitated
for
moment
then
followed
The
screams
were
indeed
coming
from
the
Entrance
Hall
they
grew
louder
Harry
ran
towards
the
stone
steps
leading
from
the
dungeons
When
reached
the
top
found
the
Entrance
Hall
packed
students
had
come
flooding
out
the
Great
Hall
where
dinner
was
still
progress
see
what
was
going
others
had
crammed
themselves
the
marble
staircase
Harry
pushed
forwards
through
knot
tall
Slytherins
and
saw
that
the
onlookers
had
formed
great
ring
some
them
looking
shocked
others
even
frightened
Professor
McGonagall
was
directly
opposite
Harry
the
other
side
the
Hall
she
looked
though
what
she
was
watching
made
her
feel
faintly
sick
Professor
Trelawney
was
standing
the
middle
the
Entrance
Hall
with
her
wand
one
hand
and
empty
sherry
bottle
the
other
looking
utterly
mad
Her
hair
was
sticking
end
her
glasses
were
lopsided
that
one
eye
was
magnified
more
than
the
other
her
innumerable
shawls
and
scarves
were
trailing
haphazardly
from
her
shoulders
giving
the
impression
that
she
was
falling
apart
the
seams
Two
large
trunks
lay
the
floor
beside
her
one
them
upside
down
looked
very
much
though
had
been
thrown
down
the
stairs
after
her
Professor
Trelawney
was
staring
apparently
terrified
something
Harry
could
not
see
but
which
seemed
standing
the
foot
the
stairs
she
shrieked
This
cannot
happening
cannot
refuse
accept
You
didn
realise
this
was
coming
said
high
girlish
voice
sounding
callously
amused
and
Harry
moving
slightly
his
right
saw
that
Trelawney
terrifying
vision
was
nothing
other
than
Professor
Umbridge
Incapable
though
you
are
predicting
even
tomorrow
weather
you
must
surely
have
realised
that
your
pitiful
performance
during
inspections
and
lack
any
improvement
would
make
inevitable
that
you
would
sacked
You
can
howled
Professor
Trelawney
tears
streaming
down
her
face
from
behind
her
enormous
lenses
you
can
sack
been
here
sixteen
years
Hogwarts
home
was
your
home
said
Professor
Umbridge
and
Harry
was
revolted
see
the
enjoyment
stretching
her
toadlike
face
she
watched
Professor
Trelawney
sink
sobbing
uncontrollably
one
her
trunks
until
hour
ago
when
the
Minister
for
Magic
countersigned
your
Order
Dismissal
Now
kindly
remove
yourself
from
this
Hall
You
are
embarrassing
But
she
stood
and
watched
with
expression
gloating
enjoyment
Professor
Trelawney
shuddered
and
moaned
rocking
backwards
and
forwards
her
trunk
paroxysms
grief
Harry
heard
muffled
sob
his
left
and
looked
around
Lavender
and
Parvati
were
both
crying
quietly
their
arms
round
each
other
Then
heard
footsteps
Professor
McGonagall
had
broken
away
from
the
spectators
marched
straight
Professor
Trelawney
and
was
patting
her
firmly
the
back
while
withdrawing
large
handkerchief
from
within
her
robes
There
there
Sybill
calm
down
blow
your
nose
this
not
bad
you
think
now
you
are
not
going
have
leave
Hogwarts
really
Professor
McGonagall
said
Umbridge
deadly
voice
taking
few
steps
forward
And
your
authority
for
that
statement
That
would
mine
said
deep
voice
The
oaken
front
doors
had
swung
open
Students
beside
them
scuttled
out
the
way
Dumbledore
appeared
the
entrance
What
had
been
doing
out
the
grounds
Harry
could
not
imagine
but
there
was
something
impressive
about
the
sight
him
framed
the
doorway
against
oddly
misty
night
Leaving
the
doors
wide
open
behind
him
strode
forwards
through
the
circle
onlookers
towards
Professor
Trelawney
tear
stained
and
trembling
her
trunk
Professor
McGonagall
alongside
her
Yours
Professor
Dumbledore
said
Umbridge
with
singularly
unpleasant
little
laugh
afraid
you
not
understand
the
position
have
here
she
pulled
parchment
scroll
from
within
her
robes
Order

the

that

Harry
very
great
surprise
Dumbledore
continued
smile
looked
down
Professor
Trelawney
who
was
still
sobbing
and
choking
her
trunk
and
said
You
are
quite
right
course
Professor
Umbridge
High
Inquisitor
you
have
every
right

teachers
You
not

have

went
with
courteous
little
bow
that
the
power
that
still
resides
with
the
Headmaster
and
wish
that
Professor
Trelawney
continue
live
Hogwarts
this
Professor
Trelawney
gave
wild
little
laugh
which
hiccough
was
barely
hidden
Dumbledore
shall
leave
Hogwarts
and
seek
fortune
elsewhere
said
Dumbledore
sharply
wish
that
you
remain

said
McGonagall

Sybill
Professor
Sprout
came
hurrying
forwards
out
the
crowd
and
grabbed
Professor
Trelawney
other
arm
Together
they
guided
her
past
Umbridge
and
the
marble
stairs
Professor
Flitwick
went
scurrying
after
them
his
wand
held
out
before
him
squeaked
Locomotor
trunks
and
Professor
Trelawney
luggage
rose
into
the
air
and
proceeded
the
staircase
after
her
Professor
Flitwick
bringing
the
rear
Professor
Umbridge
was
standing
stock
still
staring
Dumbledore
who
continued
smile
benignly
And
what
she
said
whisper
that
carried
all
around

Entrance
Hall

pleasantly
You

Umbridge
shrilly
You

that

The

Headmaster

said
Dumbledore
And
happy
say
that
this
occasion
have
succeeded
May
introduce
you
turned
face
the
open
front
doors
through
which
night
mist
was
now
drifting
Harry
heard
hooves
There
was
shocked
murmur
around
the
Hall
and
those
nearest
the
doors
hastily
moved
even
further
backwards
some
them
tripping
over
their
haste
clear
path
for
the
newcomer
Through
the
mist
came
face
Harry
had
seen
once
before
dark
dangerous
night

Forbidden
Forest
white
blond
hair
and
astonishingly
blue
eyes
the

and

This

Dumbledore
happily
thunderstruck
Umbridge

Hermione
asked
Parvati
smirking
was
breakfast
time
two
days
after
the
sacking
Professor
Trelawney
and
Parvati
was
curling
her
eyelashes
around
her
wand
and
examining
the
effect
the
back
her
spoon
They
were
have
their
first
lesson
with
Firenze
that
morning
Not
really
said
Hermione
indifferently
who
was
reading
theDaily
Prophet
never
really
liked
horses
She
turned
page
the
newspaper
and
scanned
its
columns
not
horse
centaur
said
Lavender
sounding
shocked
Agorgeous
centaur
sighed
Parvati
Either
way
still
got
four
legs
said
Hermione
coolly
Anyway
thought
you
two
were
all
upset
that
Trelawney
had
gone
are
Lavender
assured
her
went
her
office
see
her
took
her
some
daffodils
not
the
honking
ones
that
Sprout
got
nice
ones
How
she
asked
Harry
Not
very
good
poor
thing
said
Lavender
sympathetically
She
was
crying
and
saying
she
rather
leave
the
castle
for
ever
than
stay
here
where
Umbridge
and
don
blame
her
Umbridge
was
horrible
her
wasn
she
got
feeling
Umbridge
has
only
just
started
being
horrible
said
Hermione
darkly
Impossible
said
Ron
who
was
tucking
into
large
plate
eggs
and
bacon
She
can
get
any
worse
than
she
been
already
You
mark
words
she
going
want
revenge
Dumbledore
for
appointing
new
teacher
without
consulting
her
said
Hermione
closing
the
newspaper
Especially
another
part
human
You
saw
the
look
her
face
when
she
saw
Firenze
After
breakfast
Hermione
departed
for
her
Arithmancy
class
Harry
and
Ron
followed
Parvati
and
Lavender
into
the
Entrance
Hall
heading
for
Divination
Aren
going
North
Tower

Ron
looking
puzzled
Parvati
bypassed
the
marble
staircase
Parvati
looked
him
scornfully
over
her
shoulder
How
you

Firenze

classroom
eleven
now

the
noticeboard
yesterday
Classroom
eleven
was
the
ground
floor
along
the
corridor
leading
off
the
Entrance
Hall
from
the
opposite
side
the
Great
Hall
Harry
knew
was
one
those
classrooms
that
were
never
used
regularly
and
therefore
had
the
slightly
neglected
feeling
cupboard
storeroom
When
entered
right
behind
Ron
and
found
himself
the
middle
forest
clearing
was
therefore
momentarily
stunned
What
the
The
classroom
floor
had
become
springily
mossy
and
trees
were
growing
out
their
leafy
branches
fanned
across
the
ceiling
and
windows
that
the
room
was
full
slanting
shafts
soft
dappled
green
light
The
students
who
had
already
arrived
were
sitting
the
earthy
floor
with
their
backs
resting
against
tree
trunks
boulders
arms
wrapped
around
their
knees
folded
tightly
across
their
chests
and
all
looking
rather
nervous
the

where
there
were
trees
stood

when
Harry

Harry

with
the

surveyed
him
unblinkingly
through
those
astonishingly
blue
eyes
but
did
not

you
And
you
said
the
centaur

all
looking
him
awe
apparently
deeply
impressed
that
was
speaking
terms
with
Firenze
whom
they
seemed
find
intimidating
When
the
door
was
closed
and
the
last
student
had
sat
down
tree
stump
beside
the
wastepaper
basket
Firenze
gestured
around
the
room
Professor
Dumbledore
has
kindly
arranged
this
classroom
for
said
Firenze
when
everyone
had
settled
down
imitation
natural
habitat
would
have
preferred
teach
you
the
Forbidden
Forest
which
was
until
Monday
home
but
that
longer
possible
Please
sir
said
Parvati
breathlessly
raising
her
hand
why
not
been
there
with
Hagrid
not
frightened
not
question
your
bravery
said
Firenze
but

return
the
Forest

said
Lavender
confused
voice
and
Harry
knew
she
was
thinking
cows
What
Comprehension
dawned
her
face
There
aremore
you
she
said
stunned
Did
Hagrid
breed
you
like
the
Thestrals
asked
Dean
eagerly
Firenze
turned
his
head
very
slowly
face
Dean
who
seemed
realise
once
that
had
said
something
very
offensive
didn
meant
sorry
finished
hushed
voice
Centaurs
are
not
the
servants
playthings
humans
said
Firenze
quietly
There
was
pause
then
Parvati
raised
her
hand
again
Please
sir
why
have
the
other
centaurs
banished
you
Because
have
agreed
work
for
Professor
Dumbledore
said
Firenze
They
see
this
betrayal
our
kind
Harry
remembered
how
nearly
four
years
ago
the
centaur
Bane
had
shouted
Firenze
for
allowing
Harry
ride
safety
his
back
had
called
him
common
mule
wondered
whether
had
been
Bane
who
had
kicked
Firenze
the
chest
Let
begin
said
Firenze
swished
his
long
palomino
tail
raised
his
hand
towards
the
leafy
canopy
overhead
then
lowered
slowly
and
did
the
light
the
room
dimmed
that
they
now
seemed
sitting
forest
clearing
twilight
and
stars
appeared
the
ceiling
There
wereoohs
and
gasps
and
Ron
said
audibly
Blimey
Lie
back
the
floor
said
Firenze
his
calm
voice
and
observe
the
heavens
Here
written
for
those
who
can
see
the
fortune
our
races
Harry
stretched
out
his
back
and
gazed
upwards
the
ceiling
twinkling
red
star
winked
him
from
overhead
know
that
you
have
learned
the
names
the
planets
and
their
moons
Astronomy
said
Firenze
calm
voice
and
that
you
have
mapped
the
stars
progress
through
the
heavens
Centaurs
have
unravelled
the
mysteries
these
movements
over
centuries
Our
findings
teach
that

Professor
Trelawney

Parvati
excitedly
raising
her
hand
front
her
that
stuck
the

she
lay
her
back
Mars

and
burns
and
things
like
that
and
when
makes

Saturn
like
now
she
drew
right
angle

that
means
people
need
extra
careful
when
handling
hot
things
That
said
Firenze
calmly
human
nonsense
Parvati
hand
fell
limply
her
side
Trivial
hurts
tiny
human
accidents
said
Firenze
his
hooves
thudded
over
the
mossy
floor
These
are
more
significance
than
the
scurryings
ants
the
wide
universe
and
are
unaffected

movements
Professor
Trelawney
began
Parvati
hurt
and
indignant
voice
human
said
Firenze
simply
And
therefore
blinkered
and
fettered
the
limitations
your
kind
Harry
turned
his
head
very
slightly
look
Parvati
She
looked
very
offended
did
several
the
people
surrounding
her
Sybill
Trelawney
may
have
Seen
not
know
continued
Firenze
and
Harry
heard
the
swishing
his
tail
again
walked
and
down
before
them
but
she
wastes
her
time
the
main
the
self
flattering
nonsense
humans
call
fortune
telling
however
here
explain
the
wisdom
centaurs
which
impersonal
and
impartial
watch
the
skies
for
the
great
tides
evil
change
that
are
sometimes
marked
there
may
take
ten
years
sure
what
are
seeing
Firenze
pointed
the
red
star
directly
above
Harry
the
past
decade
the
indications
have
been
that
wizardkind
living
through
nothing
more
than
brief
calm
between
two
wars
Mars
bringer
battle
shines
brightly
above
suggesting
that
the
fight
must
soon
break
out
again
How
soon
centaurs
may
attempt
divine
the
burning
certain
herbs
and
leaves
the
observation
fume
and
flame
was
the
most
unusual
lesson
Harry
had
ever
attended
They
did
indeed
burn
sage
and
mallowsweet
there
the
classroom
floor
and
Firenze
told
them
look
for
certain
shapes
and
symbols
the
pungent
fumes
but
seemed
perfectly
unconcerned
that
not
one
them
could
see
any
the
signs
described
telling
them
that
humans
were
hardly
ever
good
this
that
took
centaurs
years
and
years
become
competent
and
finished
telling
them
that
was
foolish
put
too
much
faith
such
things
anyway
because
even
centaurs
sometimes
read
them
wrongly
was
nothing
like
any
human
teacher
Harry
had
ever
had
His
priority
did
not
seem
teach
them
what
knew
but
rather
impress
upon
them
that
nothing
not
even
centaurs
knowledge
was
foolproof
not
very
definite
anything
said
Ron
low
voice
they
put
out
their
mallowsweet
fire
mean
could
with
few
more
details
about
this
war
about
have
couldn
you
The
bell
rang
right
outside
the
classroom
door
and
everyone
jumped
Harry
had
completely
forgotten
they
were
still
inside
the
castle
and
quite
convinced
that
was
really
the
Forest
The
class
filed
out
looking
slightly
perplexed
Harry
and
Ron
were
the
point
following
them
when
Firenze
called
Harry
Potter
word
please
Harry
turned
The
centaur
advanced
little
towards
him
Ron
hesitated
You
may
stay
Firenze
told
him
But
close
the
door
please
Ron
hastened
obey
Harry
Potter
you
are
friend
Hagrid
are
you
not
said
the
centaur
Yes
said
Harry
Then
give
him
warning
from
His
attempt
not
working
would
better
abandon
His
attempt
not
working
Harry
repeated
blankly
And
would
better
abandon
said
Firenze
nodding
would
warn
Hagrid
myself
but
banished
would
unwise
for
too
near
the
Forest
now
Hagrid
has
troubles
enough
without
centaurs
battle
But
what
Hagrid
attempting
said
Harry
nervously
Firenze
surveyed
Harry
impassively
Hagrid
has
recently
rendered
great
service
said
Firenze
and
has
long
since
earned
respect
for
the
care
shows
all
living
creatures
shall
not
betray
his
secret
But
must
brought
his
senses
The
attempt
not
working
Tell
him
Harry
Potter
Good
day
you
The
happiness
Harry
had
felt
the
aftermath
ofThe
Quibbler
interview
had
long
since
evaporated
dull
March
blurred
into
squally
April
his
life
seemed
have
become
one
long
series
worries
and
problems
again
Umbridge
had
continued
attending
all
Care
Magical
Creatures
lessons
had
been
very
difficult
deliver
Firenze
warning
Hagrid
last
Harry
had
managed
pretending
lost
his
copy
ofFantastic
Beasts
and
Where
Find
Them
and
doubling
back
after
class
one
day
When
repeated
Firenze
words
Hagrid
gazed
him
for
moment
through
his
puffy
blackened
eyes
apparently
taken
aback
Then
seemed
pull
himself
together
Nice
bloke
Firenze
said
gruffly
but
don
know
what
talkin
abou
this
The
attemp
comin
fine
Hagrid
what
you
asked
Harry
seriously
Because
you
got
careful
Umbridge
has
already
sacked
Trelawney
and
you
ask
she
roll
you
doing
anything
you
shouldn
you
There
things
more
importan
than
keepin
job
said
Hagrid
though
his
hands
shook
slightly
said
this
and
basin
full
Knarl
droppings
crashed
the
floor
Don
worry
abou
Harry
jus
get
along
now
there
good
lad
Harry
had
choice
but
leave
Hagrid
mopping
the
dung
all
over
his
floor
but
felt
thoroughly
dispirited
trudged
back
the
castle
Meanwhile
the
teachers
and
Hermione
persisted
reminding
them
the
were
drawing
ever
nearer
All
the
fifth
years
were
suffering
from
stress
some
degree
but
Hannah
Abbott
became
the
first
receive
Calming
Draught
from
Madam
Pomfrey
after
she
burst
into
tears
during
Herbology
and
sobbed
that
she
was
too
stupid
take
exams
and
wanted
leave
school
now
had
not
been
for
the
lessons
Harry
thought
would
have
been
extremely
unhappy
sometimes
felt
was
living
for
the
hours
spent
the
Room
Requirement
working
hard
but
thoroughly
enjoying
himself
the
same
time
swelling
with
pride
looked
around
his
fellow
members
and
saw
how
far
they
had
come
Indeed
Harry
sometimes
wondered
how
Umbridge
was
going
react
when
all
the
members
the
received
Outstanding
their
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
They
had
finally
started
work
Patronuses
which
everybody
had
been
very
keen
practise
though
Harry
kept
reminding
them
producing
Patronus
the
middle
brightly
lit
classroom
when
they
were
not
under
threat
was
very
different
from
producing
when
confronted
something
like
Dementor
don
such
killjoy
said
Cho
brightly
watching
her
silvery
swan
shaped
Patronus
soar
around
the
Room
Requirement
during
their
last
lesson
before
Easter
They
pretty
They
not
supposed

said
Harry
patiently
What
really
need
Boggart
something
that
how
learned
had
conjure
Patronus
while
the
Boggart
was
pretending
Dementor
But
that
would
really
scary
said
Lavender
who
was
shooting
puffs
silver
vapour
out
the
end
her
wand
And
still
can
she
added
angrily
Neville
was
having
trouble
too
His
face
was
screwed
concentration
but
only
feeble
wisps
silver
smoke
issued
from
his
wand
tip
You
got
think
something
happy
Harry
reminded
him
trying
said
Neville
miserably
who
was
trying
hard
his
round
face
was
actually
shining
with
sweat
Harry
think
doing
yelled
Seamus
who
had
been
brought
along
his
first
ever
meeting
Dean
Look
gone
but
was
definitely
something
hairy
Harry
Hermione
Patronus
shining
silver
otter
was
gambolling
around
her
Theyare
sort
nice
aren
they
she
said
looking
fondly
The
door
the
Room
Requirement
opened
and
closed
Harry
looked
round
see
who
had
entered
but
there
did
not
seem
anybody
there
was
few
moments
before
realised
that
the
people
close
the
door
had
fallen
silent
Next
thing
knew
something
was
tugging
his
robes
somewhere
near
the
knee
looked
down
and
saw
his
very
great
astonishment
Dobby
the
house
elf
peering
him
from
beneath
his
usual
eight
woolly
hats
Dobby
said
What
are
you
What
wrong
The
elf
eyes
were
wide
with
terror
and
was
shaking
The
members
the
closest
Harry
had
fallen
silent
everybody
the
room
was
watching
Dobby
The
few
Patronuses
people
had
managed
conjure
faded
away
into
silver
mist
leaving
the
room
looking
much
darker
than
before
Harry
Potter

squeaked
the
elf
trembling
from
head
foot
Harry
Potter
sir
Dobby

come
warn
you
but

ran
head
first
the
wall
Harry
who
had
some
experience
Dobby
habits
self
punishment
made
seize
him
but
Dobby
merely
bounced
off
the
stone
cushioned
his
eight
hats
Hermione
and
few
the
other
girls
let
out
squeaks
fear
and
sympathy
What
happened
Dobby
Harry
asked
grabbing
the
elf
tiny
arm
and
holding
him
away
from
anything
with
which
might
seek

himself
Harry
Potter
she
she
Dobby
hit
himself
hard
the
nose
with
his
free
fist
Harry
seized
that
too
Who
she
Dobby
But
thought
knew
surely
only
one
she
could
induce
such
fear
Dobby
The
elf
looked
him
slightly
cross
eyed
and
mouthed
wordlessly
Umbridge
asked
Harry
horrified
Dobby
nodded
then
tried
bang
his
head
Harry
knees
Harry
held
him
arm
length
What
about
her
Dobby
she
hasn
found
out
about
this
about
about

answer
the
elf
stricken

His
hands
held
fast
Harry
the
elf
tried
kick
himself
and
fell
the
floor
she
coming
Harry
asked
quietly
Dobby
let
out
howl
and
began
beating
his
bare
feet
hard
the
floor
Yes
Harry
Potter
yes
Harry
straightened
and
looked
around
the
motionless
terrified
people
gazing
the
thrashing
elf
WHAT
ARE
YOU
WAITING
FOR
Harry
bellowed
RUN
They
all
pelted
towards
the
exit
once
forming
scrum
the
door
then
people
burst
through
Harry
could
hear
them
sprinting
along
the
corridors
and
hoped
they
had
the
sense
not
try
and
make
all
the
way
their
dormitories
was
only
ten
nine
they
just
took
refuge
the
library
the
Owlery
which
were
both
nearer
Harry

shrieked
Hermione
from
the
centre
the
knot
people
now
fighting
get
out
scooped
Dobby
who
was
still
attempting
himself
serious
injury
and
ran
with
the
elf
his
arms
join
the
back
the
queue
Dobby
this
order
get
back
down
the
kitchen
with
the
other
elves
and
she
asks

Harry
And
forbid

added
dropping
the
elf
made
over
the
threshold
last
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
Thank
you
Harry
Potter
squeaked
Dobby
and
streaked
off
Harry
glanced
left
and
right
the
others
were
all
moving
fast
caught
only
glimpses
flying
heels
either
end
the
corridor
before
they
vanished
started
run
right
there
was

there
all

AAARGH
Something
caught
him
around
the
ankles
and
fell
spectacularly
skidding
along
his
front
for
six
feet
before
coming
halt
Someone
behind
him
was
laughing
rolled
over
his
back
and
saw
Malfoy
concealed
niche
beneath
ugly
dragon
shaped
vase
Trip
Jinx
Potter
said
Hey
Professor
PROFESSOR
got
one
Umbridge
came
bustling
round
the
far
corner
breathless
but
wearing
delighted
smile
him
she
said
jubilantly
the
sight
Harry
the
floor
Excellent
Draco
excellent
very
good
fifty
points
Slytherin
take
him
from

Potter
Harry
got
his
feet
glaring
the
pair
them
had
never
seen
Umbridge
looking
happy
She
seized
his
arm
vice
like
grip
and
turned
beaming
broadly
Malfoy
You
hop
along
and
see
you
can
round
any
more
them
Draco
she
said
Tell
the
others
look
the
library
anybody
out

check
the
bathrooms
Miss
Parkinson
can
the
girls
ones
off
you
and

she
added
her
softest
most
dangerous
voice
Malfoy
walked
away
you
can
come
with
the
Headmaster
office
Potter
They
were
the
stone
gargoyle
within
minutes
Harry
wondered
how
many
the
others
had
been
caught
thought
Ron
Mrs
Weasley
would
kill
him
and
how
Hermione
would
feel
she
was
expelled
before
she
could
take
her
And
had
been
Seamus
very
first
meeting
and
Neville
had
been
getting
good
Fizzing
Whizzbee
sang
Umbridge
the
stone
gargoyle
jumped
aside
the
wall
behind
split
open
and
they
ascended
the
moving
stone
staircase
They
reached
the
polished
door
with
the
griffin
knocker
but
Umbridge
did
not
bother
knock
she
strode
straight
inside
still
holding
tight
Harry
The
office
was
full
people
Dumbledore
was
sitting
behind
his
desk
his
expression
serene
the
tips
his
long
fingers
together
Professor
McGonagall
stood
rigidly
beside
him
her
face
extremely
tense
Cornelius
Fudge
Minister
for
Magic
was
rocking
backwards
and
forwards
his
toes
beside
the
fire
apparently
immensely
pleased
with
the
situation
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
and
tough
looking
wizard
with
very
short
wiry
hair
whom
Harry
did
not
recognise
were
positioned
either
side
the
door
like
guards
and
the
freckled
bespectacled
form
Percy
Weasley
hovered
excitedly
beside
the
wall
quill
and
heavy
scroll
parchment
his
hands
apparently
poised
take
notes
The
portraits
old
headmasters
and
headmistresses
were
not
shamming
sleep
tonight
All
them
were
alert
and
serious
watching
what
was
happening
below
them
Harry
entered
few
flitted
into
neighbouring
frames
and
whispered
urgently
into
their
neighbour
ear
Harry
pulled
himself
free
Umbridge
grasp
the
door
swung
shut
behind
them
Cornelius
Fudge
was
glaring
him
with
kind
vicious
satisfaction
his
face
Well
said
Well
well
well
Harry
replied
with
the
dirtiest
look
could
muster
His
heart
drummed
madly
inside
him
but
his
brain
was
oddly
cool
and
clear
was
heading
back
Gryffindor
Tower
said
Umbridge
There
was
indecent
excitement
her
voice
the
same
callous
pleasure
Harry
had
heard
she
watched
Professor
Trelawney
dissolving
with
misery
the
Entrance
Hall
The
Malfoy
boy
cornered
him
Did
did
said
Fudge
appreciatively
must
remember
tell
Lucius
Well
Potter
expect
you
know
why
you
are
here
Harry
fully
intended
respond
with
defiant
yes
his
mouth
had
opened
and
the
word
was
half
formed
when
caught
sight
Dumbledore
face
Dumbledore
was
not
looking
directly
Harry
his
eyes
were
fixed
point
just
over
his
shoulder
but
Harry
stared
him
shook
his
head
fraction
inch
each
side
Harry
changed
direction
mid
word
beg
your
pardon
said
Fudge
said
Harry
firmly
Youdon
know
why
you
are
here
don
said
Harry
Fudge
looked
incredulously
from
Harry
Professor
Umbridge
Harry
took
advantage
his
momentary
inattention
steal
another
quick
look
Dumbledore
who
gave
the
carpet
the
tiniest
nods
and
the
shadow
wink
you
have
idea
said
Fudge
voice
positively
sagging
with
sarcasm
why
Professor
Umbridge
has
brought
you
this
office
You
are
not
aware
that
you
have
broken
any
school
rules
School

Harry

Fudge
angrily
Not
that
aware
said
Harry
blandly
His
heart
was
still
hammering
very
fast
was
almost
worth
telling
these
lies
watch
Fudge
blood
pressure
rising
but
could
not
see
how
earth
would
get
away
with
them
somebody
had
tipped
off
Umbridge
about
the
then
the
leader
might
well
packing
his
trunk
right
now
news
you
said
Fudge
his
voice
now
thick
with
anger
that
illegal
student
organisation
has
been
discovered
within
this
school
Yes
said
Harry
hoisting
unconvincing
look
innocent
surprise
his
face
think
Minister
said
Umbridge
silkily
from
beside
him
might
make
better
progress
fetch
our
informant
Yes
yes
said
Fudge
nodding
and
glanced
maliciously
Dumbledore
Umbridge
left
the
room
There
nothing
like
good
witness
there
Dumbledore
Nothing
all
Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
gravely
inclining
his
head
There
was
wait
several
minutes
which
nobody
looked
each
other
then
Harry
heard
the
door
open
behind
him
Umbridge
moved
past
him
into
the
room
gripping
the
shoulder
Cho
curly
haired
friend
Marietta
who
was
hiding
her
face
her
hands
Don
scared
dear
don
frightened
said
Professor
Umbridge
softly
patting
her
the
back
quite
all
right
now
You
have
done
the
right
thing
The
Minister
very
pleased
with
you
telling
your
mother
what
good
girl
you
been
Marietta
mother
Minister
she
added
looking
Fudge
Madam
Edgecombe
from
the
Department
Magical
Transportation
Floo
Network
office
she
been
helping
police
the
Hogwarts
fires
you
know
Jolly
good
jolly
good
said
Fudge
heartily
Like
mother
like
daughter
Well
come
now
dear
look
don
shy
let
hear
what
you
got
galloping
gargoyles
Marietta
raised
her
head
Fudge
leapt
backwards
shock
nearly
landing
himself
the
fire
cursed
and
stamped
the
hem
his
cloak
which
had
started
smoke
Marietta
gave
wail
and
pulled
the
neck
her
robes
right
her
eyes
but
not
before
everyone
had
seen
that
her
face
was
horribly
disfigured
series
close
set
purple
pustules
that
had
spread
across
her
nose
and
cheeks
form
the
word
SNEAK
Never
mind
the
spots
now
dear
said
Umbridge
impatiently
just
take
your
robes
away
from
your
mouth
and
tell
the
Minister
But
Marietta
gave
another
muffled
wail
and
shook
her
head
frantically
very
well
you
silly
girl
lltell
him
snapped
Umbridge
She
hitched
her
sickly
smile
back
her
face
and
said
Well
Minister
Miss
Edgecombe
here
came
office
shortly
after
dinner
this
evening
and
told
she
had
something
she
wanted
tell
She
said
that
proceeded
secret
room
the
seventh
floor
sometimes
known
the
Room
Requirement
would
find
out
something
advantage
questioned
her
little
further
and
she
admitted
that
there
was
some
kind
meeting
there
Unfortunately
that
point
this
hex
she
waved
impatiently
Marietta
concealed
face
came
into
operationand
upon
catching
sight
her
face
mirror
the
girl
became
too
distressed
tell
any
more
Well
now
said
Fudge
fixing
Marietta
with
what
evidently
imagined
was
kind
and
fatherly
look
very
brave
you
dear
coming
tell
Professor
Umbridge
You
did
exactly
the
right
thing
Now
will
you
tell
what
happened
this
meeting
What
was
its
purpose
Who
was
there
But
Marietta
would
not
speak
she
merely
shook
her
head
again
her
eyes
wide
and
fearful
Haven
got
counter
jinx
for
this
Fudge
asked
Umbridge
impatiently
gesturing
Marietta
face
she
can
speak
freely
have
not
yet
managed
find
one
Umbridge
admitted
grudgingly
and
Harry
felt
surge
pride
Hermione
jinxing
ability
But
doesn
matter
she
won
speak
can
take
the
story
from
here
You
will
remember
Minister
that
sent
you
report
back
October
that
Potter
had
met
number
fellow
students
the
Hog
Head
Hogsmeade
And
what
your
evidence
for
that
cut
Professor
McGonagall
have
testimony
from
Willy
Widdershins
Minerva
who
happened
the
bar
the
time
was
heavily
bandaged
true
but
his
hearing
was
quite
unimpaired
said
Umbridge
smugly
heard
every
word
Potter
said
and
hastened
straight
the
school
report
that
why
wasn
prosecuted
for
setting
all
those
regurgitating
toilets
said
Professor
McGonagall
raising
her
eyebrows
What
interesting
insight
into
our
justice
system
Blatant
corruption
roared
the
portrait
the
corpulent
red
nosed
wizard
the
wall
behind
Dumbledore
desk
The
Ministry
did
not
cut
deals
with
petty
criminals
day
sir
they
did
not
Thank
you
Fortescue
that
will
said
Dumbledore
softly
The
purpose
Potter
meeting
with
these
students
continued
Professor
Umbridge
was
persuade
them
join
illegal
society
whose
aim
was
learn
spells
and
curses
the
Ministry
has
decided
are
inappropriate
for
school
age
think
you
find
you
wrong
there
Dolores
said
Dumbledore
quietly
peering
her
over
the
half
moon
spectacles
perched
halfway
down
his
crooked
nose
Harry
stared
him
could
not
see
how
Dumbledore
was
going
talk
him
out
this
one
Willy
Widdershins
had
indeed
heard
every
word
had
said
the
Hog
Head
there
was
simply
escaping
Oho
said
Fudge
bouncing
and
down
the
balls
his
feet
again
Yes
let
hear
the
latest
cock
and
bull
story
designed
pull
Potter
out
trouble
then
Dumbledore
Willy
Widdershins
was
lying
was
was
Potter
identical
twin
the
Hog
Head
that
day
there
the
usual
simple
explanation
involving
reversal
time
dead
man
coming
back
life
and
couple
invisible
Dementors
Percy
Weasley
let
out
hearty
laugh
very
good
Minister
very
good
Harry
could
have
kicked
him
Then
saw
his
astonishment
that
Dumbledore
was
smiling
gently
too
Cornelius
not
deny
and
nor
sure
does
Harry
that
was
the
Hog
Head
that
day
nor
that
was
trying
recruit
students
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
group
merely
pointing
out
that
Dolores
quite
wrong
suggest
that
such
group
was
that
time
illegal
you
remember
the
Ministry
Decree
banning
all
student
societies
was
not
put
into
effect
until
two
days
after
Harry
Hogsmeade
meeting
was
not
breaking
any
rules
all
the
Hog
Head
Percy
looked
though
had
been
struck
the
face
something
very
heavy
Fudge
remained
motionless
mid
bounce
his
mouth
hanging
open
Umbridge
recovered
first
That
all
very
fine
Headmaster
she
said
smiling
sweetly
but
are
now
nearly
six
months
from
the
introduction
Educational
Decree
Number
Twenty
four
the
first
meeting
was
not
illegal
all
those
that
have
happened
since
most
certainly
are
Well
said
Dumbledore
surveying
her
with
polite
interest
over
the
top
his
interlocked
fingers
they
certainlywould
theyhad
continued
after
the
Decree
came
into
effect
you
have
any
evidence
that
any
such
meetings
continued
Dumbledore
spoke
Harry
heard
rustle
behind
him
and
rather
thought
Kingsley
whispered
something
could
have
sworn
too
that
felt
something
brush
against
his
side
gentle
something
like
draught
bird
wings
but
looking
down
saw
nothing
there
Evidence
repeated
Umbridge
with
that
horrible
wide
toad
like
smile
Have
you
not
been
listening
Dumbledore
Why
you
think
Miss
Edgecombe
here
can
she
tell
about
six
months
worth
meetings
said
Dumbledore
raising
his
eyebrows
was
under
the
impression
that
she
was
merely
reporting
meeting
tonight
Miss
Edgecombe
said
Umbridge
once
tell
how
long
these
meetings
have
been
going
dear
You
can
simply
nod
shake
your
head
sure
that
won
make
the
spots
worse
Have
they
been
happening
regularly
over
the
last
six
months
Harry
felt
horrible
plummeting
his
stomach
This
was
they
had
hit
dead
end
solid
evidence
that
not
even
Dumbledore
would
able
shift
aside
Just
nod
shake
your
head
dear
Umbridge
said
coaxingly
Marietta
come
now
that
won
activate
the
jinx
Everyone
the
room
was
gazing
the
top
Marietta
face
Only
her
eyes
were
visible
between
the
pulled
robes
and
her
curly
fringe
Perhaps
was
trick
the
firelight
but
her
eyes
looked
oddly
blank
And
then
Harry
utter
amazement
Marietta
shook
her
head
Umbridge
looked
quickly
Fudge
then
back
Marietta
don
think
you
understood
the
question
did
you
dear
asking
whether
you
been
going
these
meetings
for
the
past
six
months
You
have
haven
you
Again
Marietta
shook
her
head
What
you
mean
shaking
your
head
dear
said
Umbridge
testy
voice
would
have
thought
her
meaning
was
quite
clear
said
Professor
McGonagall
harshly
there
have
been
secret
meetings
for
the
past
six
months
that
correct
Miss
Edgecombe
Marietta
nodded
But
there
was
meeting
tonight
said
Umbridge
furiously
There
was
meeting
Miss
Edgecombe
you
told
about
the
Room
Requirement
And
Potter
was
the
leader
was
not
Potter
organised
Potter
why
are
you
shaking
your
head
girl
Well
usually
when
person
shakes
their
head
said
McGonagall
coldly
they
mean
unless
Miss
Edgecombe
using
form
sign
language
yet
unknown
humans
Professor
Umbridge
seized
Marietta
pulled
her
round
face
her
and
began
shaking
her
very
hard
split
second
later
Dumbledore
was
his
feet
his
wand
raised
Kingsley
started
forwards
and
Umbridge
leapt
back
from
Marietta
waving
her
hands
the
air
though
they
had
been
burned
cannot
allow
you
manhandle
students
Dolores
said
Dumbledore
and
for
the
first
time
looked
angry
You
want
calm
yourself
Madam
Umbridge
said
Kingsley
his
deep
slow
voice
You
don
want
get
yourself
into
trouble
now
said
Umbridge
breathlessly
glancing
the
towering
figure
Kingsley
mean
yes
you
right
Shacklebolt
forgot
myself
Marietta
was
standing
exactly
where
Umbridge
had
released
her
She
seemed
neither
perturbed
Umbridge
sudden
attack
nor
relieved
her
release
she
was
still
clutching
her
robe
her
oddly
blank
eyes
and
staring
straight
ahead
her
sudden
suspicion
connected
Kingsley
whisper
and
the
thing
had
felt
shoot
past
him
sprang
into
Harry
mind
Dolores
said
Fudge
with
the
air
trying
settle
something
once
and
for
all
the
meeting
tonight
the
one
know
definitely
happened
Yes
said
Umbridge
pulling
herself
together
yes
well
Miss
Edgecombe
tipped
off
and
proceeded
once
the
seventh
floor
accompanied
certaintrustworthy
students
catch
those
the
meeting
red
handed
appears
that
they
were
forewarned

however
because
when
reached
the
seventh
floor
they
were
running
every
direction
does
not
matter
however

all
their
names
here
Miss
Parkinson
ran
into
the
Room
Requirement
for
see
they
had
left
anything
behind
needed
evidence
and
the
room
provided
And
Harry
horror
she
withdrew
from
her
pocket
the
list
names
that
had
been
pinned
upon
the
Room
Requirement
wall
and
handed
Fudge
The
moment
saw
Potter
name
the
list
knew
what
were
dealing
with
she
said
softly
Excellent
said
Fudge
smile
spreading
across
his
face
excellent
Dolores
And
thunder
looked
Dumbledore
who
was
still
standing
beside
Marietta
his
wand
held
loosely
his
hand
See
what
they
named
themselves
said
Fudge
quietly
Dumbledore
Army
Dumbledore
reached
out
and
took
the
piece
parchment
from
Fudge
gazed
the
heading
scribbled
Hermione
months
before
and
for
moment
seemed
unable
speak
Then
looked
smiling
Well
the
game
said
simply
Would
you
like
written
confession
from
Cornelius
will
statement
before
these
witnesses
suffice
Harry
saw
McGonagall
and
Kingsley
look
each
other
There
was
fear
both
faces
did
not
understand
what
was
going
and
nor
apparently
did
Fudge
Statement
said
Fudge
slowly
What
don
Dumbledore

Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
still
smiling
waved
the
list
names
before
Fudge
face
Not
Potter
Army
Dumbledore
Army
But
but
Understanding
blazed
suddenly
Fudge
face
took
horrified
step
backwards
yelped
and
jumped
out
the
fire
again
You
whispered
stamping
again
his
smouldering
cloak
That
right
said
Dumbledore
pleasantly
You
organised
this
did
said
Dumbledore
You
recruited
these
students
for
for
your
army
Tonight

supposed
the
first

said
Dumbledore
nodding
Merely

whether
they
would

now
that

Miss
Edgecombe

Marietta
nodded
Fudge
looked
from
her
Dumbledore
his
chest
swelling
Then

been
plotting
against
yelled
That
right
said
Dumbledore
cheerfully
shouted
Harry
Kingsley
flashed
look
warning
him
McGonagall
widened
her
eyes
threateningly
but
had
suddenly
dawned
Harry
what
Dumbledore
was
about
and
could
not
let
happen
Professor
Dumbledore
quiet
Harry
afraid
you
will
have
leave
office
said
Dumbledore
calmly
Yes
shut
Potter
barked
Fudge
who
was
still
ogling
Dumbledore
with
kind
horrified
delight
Well
well
well
came
here
tonight
expecting
expel
Potter
and
instead
Instead

arrest
said
Dumbledore
smiling
like
losing
Knut
and
finding
Galleon
isn

Fudge
now
positively
quivering
with
delight
Weasley

confession

Yes

said
Percy
eagerly
whose
nose
was
splattered
with
ink
from
the
speed
his
note
taking
The

trying
build
army
against
the
Ministry
how
been

Yes

Percy
scanning
his

Percy
dashed
from
the
room
slamming
the
door
behind
him
and
Fudge
turned
back
Dumbledore
You
will
now
escorted
back
the
Ministry
where
you
will
formally
charged
then
sent
Azkaban
await
trial
said
Dumbledore
gently
yes
Yes
thought
might
hit
that
little
snag
Snag
said
Fudge
his
voice
still
vibrating
with
joy
see
snag
Dumbledore
Well
said
Dumbledore
apologetically
afraid
really
Well
just
that
you
seem
labouring
under
the
delusion
that
going
what
the
phrase
come
quietly
afraid
not
going
come
quietly
all
Cornelius
have
absolutely
intention
being
sent
Azkaban
could
break
out
course
but
what
waste
time
and
frankly
can
think
whole
host
things
would
rather
doing
Umbridge
face
was
growing
steadily
redder
she
looked
though
she
was
being
filled
with
boiling
water
Fudge
stared
Dumbledore
with
very
silly
expression
his
face
though
had
just
been
stunned
sudden
blow
and
could
not
quite
believe
had
happened
made
small
choking
noise
then
looked
round
Kingsley
and
the
man
with
short
grey
hair
who
alone
everyone
the
room
had
remained
entirely
silent
far
The
latter
gave
Fudge
reassuring
nod
and
moved
forwards
little
away
from
the
wall
Harry
saw
his
hand
drift
almost
casually
towards
his
pocket
Don
silly
Dawlish
said
Dumbledore
kindly
sure
you
are
excellent
Auror
seem
remember
that
you
achieved
Outstanding
all
your
but
you
attempt
bring
force
will
have
hurt
you
The
man
called
Dawlish
blinked
rather
foolishly
looked
towards
Fudge
again
but
this
time
seemed
hoping
for
clue
what
next
sneered
Fudge
recovering
himself
you
intend
take
Dawlish
Shacklebolt
Dolores
and
myself
single
handed
you
Dumbledore
Merlin

said
Dumbledore
smiling
not
unless
you
are
foolish
enough

said
Professor
McGonagall
loudly
plunging
her
hand
inside
her
robes
yes
will
Minerva
said
Dumbledore
sharply
Hogwarts

you
Enough
this
rubbish
said
Fudge
pulling
out
his
own
wand
Dawlish
Shacklebolt
Take
him
streak
silver
light
flashed
around
the
room
there
was
bang
like
gunshot
and
the
floor
trembled
hand
grabbed
the
scruff
Harry
neck
and
forced
him
down
the
floor
second
silver
flash
went
off
several
the
portraits
yelled
Fawkes
screeched
and
cloud
dust
filled
the
air
Coughing
the
dust
Harry
saw
dark
figure
fall
the
ground
with
crash
front
him
there
was
shriek
and
thud
and
somebody
cried
then
there
was
the
sound
breaking
glass
frantically
scuffling
footsteps
groan
and
silence
Harry
struggled
around
see
who
was
half
strangling
him
and
saw
Professor
McGonagall
crouched
beside
him
she
had
forced
both
him
and
Marietta
out
harm
way
Dust
was
still
floating
gently
down
through
the
air
them
Panting
slightly
Harry
saw
very
tall
figure
moving
towards
them
Are
you
all
right
Dumbledore
asked
Yes
said
Professor
McGonagall
getting
and
dragging
Harry
and
Marietta
with
her
The
dust
was
clearing
The
wreckage
the
office
loomed
into
view
Dumbledore
desk
had
been
overturned
all
the
spindly
tables
had
been
knocked
the
floor
their
silver
instruments
pieces
Fudge
Umbridge
Kingsley
and
Dawlish
lay
motionless
the
floor
Fawkes
the
phoenix
soared
wide
circles
above
them
singing
softly
Unfortunately
had
hex
Kingsley
too
would
have
looked
very
suspicious
said
Dumbledore
low
voice
was
remarkably
quick
the
uptake
modifying
Miss
Edgecombe
memory
like
that
while
everyone
was
looking
the
other
way
thank
him
for
won
you
Minerva
Now
they
will
all
awake
very
soon
and
will
best
they
not
know
that
had
time
communicate
you
must
act
though
time
has
passed
though
they
were
merely
knocked
the
ground
they
will
not
remember
Where
will
you
Dumbledore
whispered
Professor
McGonagall
Grimmauld
Place
said
Dumbledore
with
grim
smile
not
leaving
into
hiding
Fudge
will
soon
wish
never
dislodged
from
Hogwarts
promise
you
Professor
Dumbledore
Harry
began
did
not
know
what
say
first
how
sorry
was
that
had
started
the
the
first
place
and
caused
all
this
trouble
how
terrible
felt
that
Dumbledore
was
leaving
save
him
from
expulsion
But
Dumbledore
cut
him
off
before

Listen
Harry
said
urgently
You

study
Occlumency
hard
you
can

understand
everything
Professor
Snape
tells
you
and
practise
particularly
every
night
before
sleeping
that
you
can
close
your
mind
bad
dreams
you
will
understand
why
soon
enough
but
you
must
promise
The
man
called
Dawlish
was
stirring
Dumbledore
seized
Harry
wrist
Remember
close
your
mind
But
Dumbledore
fingers
closed
over
Harry
skin
pain
shot
through
the
scar
his
forehead
and
felt
again
that
terrible
snakelike
longing
strike
Dumbledore
bite
him
hurt
him
you
will
understand
whispered
Dumbledore
Fawkes
circled
the
office
and
swooped
low
over
him
Dumbledore
released
Harry
raised
his
hand
and
grasped
the
phoenix
long
golden
tail
There
was
flash
fire
and
the
pair
them
were
gone
Where
yelled
Fudge
pushing
himself
from
the
floor
Where
don
know
shouted
Kingsley
also
leaping
his
feet
Well
can
have
Disapparated
cried
Umbridge
You
can
from
inside
this
school
The
stairs
cried
Dawlish
and
flung
himself
upon
the
door
wrenched
open
and
disappeared
followed
closely
Kingsley
and
Umbridge
Fudge
hesitated
then
got
slowly
his
feet
brushing
dust
from
his
front
There
was
long
and
painful
silence
Well
Minerva
said
Fudge
nastily
straightening
his
torn
shirtsleeve
afraid
this
the
end
your
friend
Dumbledore
You
think
you
said
Professor
McGonagall
scornfully
Fudge
seemed
not
hear
her
was
looking
around
the
wrecked
office
few
the
portraits
hissed
him
one
two
even
made
rude
hand
gestures
You
better
get
those
two
off
bed
said
Fudge
looking
back
Professor
McGonagall
with
dismissive
nod
towards
Harry
and
Marietta
Professor
McGonagall
said
nothing
but
marched
Harry
and
Marietta
the
door
swung
closed
behind
them
Harry
heard
Phineas
Nigellus
voice
You

The
notices
had
gone
all
around
the

overnight
but
they
did
not
explain
how
every

within

seemed

that

escape
matter
where

went
within

the
sole
topic
conversation
was
Dumbledore
flight
and
though
some
the
details
may
have
gone
awry
the
retelling
Harry
overheard
one
second
year
girl
assuring
another
that
Fudge
was
now
lying
Mungo
with
pumpkin
for
head
was
surprising
how
accurate
the
rest
their
information
was
Everybody
knew
for
instance
that
Harry
and
Marietta
were
the
only
students
have
witnessed
the
scene
Dumbledore
office
and
Marietta
was
now
the
hospital
wing
Harry
found
himself
besieged
with
requests
give
first
hand
account
Dumbledore
will
back
before
long
said
Ernie
Macmillan
confidently
the
way
back
from
Herbology
after
listening
intently
Harry
story
They
couldn
keep
him
away
our
second
year
and
they
won
able
this
time
The
Fat
Friar
told
dropped
his
voice
conspiratorially
that
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
lean
closer
him
hear
that
Umbridge
tried
get
back
into
his
office
last
night
after
they
searched
the
castle
and
grounds
for
him
Couldn
get
past
the
gargoyle
The
Head
office
has
sealed
itself
against
her
Ernie
smirked
Apparently
she
had
right
little
tantrum
expect
she
really
fancied
herself
sitting
there
the
Head
office
said
Hermione
viciously
they
walked
the
stone
steps
into
the
Entrance
Hall
Lording
over
all
the
other
teachers
the
stupid
puffed
power
crazy
old
Now
youreally
want
finish
that
sentence
Granger
Draco
Malfoy
had
slid
out
from
behind
the
door
closely
followed
Crabbe
and
Goyle
His
pale
pointed
face
was
alight
with
malice
Afraid
going
have
dock
few
points
from
Gryffindor
and
Hufflepuff
drawled
only
teachers
who

Ernie

Malfoy
Crabbe
and

sniggered
But

Hermione
sharply
The

Anyway

but
Hermione

Malfoy
New

Potty
Weasel

Laughing
heartily
strode
away
with
Crabbe
and
Goyle
was
bluffing
said
Ernie
looking
appalled
can
allowed
dock
points
that
would
ridiculous
would
completely
undermine
the
prefect
system
But
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
turned
automatically
towards
the
giant
hour
glasses
set
niches
along
the
wall
behind
them
which
recorded
the
house
points
Gryffindor
and
Ravenclaw
had
been
neck
and
neck
the
lead
that
morning
Even
they
watched
stones
flew
upwards
reducing
the
amounts
the
lower
bulbs
fact
the
only
glass
that
seemed
unchanged
was
the
emerald
filled
one
Slytherin
Noticed
have
you
said
Fred
voice
and
George
had
just
come
down
the
marble
staircase
and
joined
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Ernie
front
the
hour
glasses
Malfoy
just
docked
all
about
fifty
points
said
Harry
furiously
they
watched
several
more
stones
fly
upwards
from
the
Gryffindor
hour
glass
Yeah
Montague
tried
during
break
said
George
What
you
mean
tried
said
Ron
quickly
never
managed
get
all
the
words
out
said
Fred
due
the
fact
that
forced
him
head
first
into
that
Vanishing
Cabinet
the
first
floor
Hermione
looked
very
shocked
But
you
get
into
terrible
trouble
Not
until
Montague
reappears
and
that
could
take
weeks
dunno
where
sent
him
said
Fred
coolly
Anyway
decided
don
care
about
getting
into
trouble
any
more
Have
you
ever
asked
Hermione
Course
have
said
George
Never
been
expelled
have
always
known
where
draw
the
line
said
Fred
might
have
put
toe
across
occasionally
said
George
But
always
stopped
short
causing
real
mayhem
said
Fred
But
now
said
Ron
tentatively
Well
now
said
George
what
with
Dumbledore
gone
said
Fred
reckon
bit
mayhem
said
George
exactly
what
our
dear
new
Head

said
Fred
You

Hermione
You

She
love
reason

You

Hermione

said
Fred
smiling
her
don
care
about
staying
any
more
walk
out
right
now
weren
determined
our
bit
for
Dumbledore
first
anyway
checked
his
watch
phase
one
about
begin
get
the
Great
Hallfor
lunch
were
you
that
way
the
teachers
will
see
you
can
have
had
anything
with
Anything
with
what
said
Hermione
anxiously
You
see
said
George
Run
along
now
Fred
and
George
turned
away
and
disappeared
into
the
swelling
crowd
descending
the
stairs
towards
lunch
Looking
highly
disconcerted
Ernie
muttered
something
about
unfinished
Transfiguration
homework
and
scurried
away
think
weshould
get
out
here
you
know
said
Hermione
nervously
Just
case
Yeah
all
right
said
Ron
and
the
three
them
moved
towards
the
doors
the
Great
Hall
but
Harry
had
barely
glimpsed
the
day
ceiling
scudding
white
clouds
when
somebody
tapped
him
the
shoulder
and
turning
found
himself
almost
nose
nose
with
Filch
the
caretaker
took
several
hasty
steps
backwards
Filch
was
best
viewed
distance
The
Headmistress
would
like
see
you
Potter
leered
didn
said
Harry
stupidly
thinking
whatever
Fred
and
George
were
planning
Filch
jowls
wobbled
with
silent
laughter
Guilty
conscience
wheezed
Follow
Harry
glanced
back
Ron
and
Hermione
who
were
both
looking
worried
shrugged
and
followed
Filch
back
into
the
Entrance
Hall
against
the
tide
hungry
students
Filch
seemed
extremely
good
mood
hummed
creakily
under
his
breath
they
climbed
the
marble
staircase
they
reached
the
first
landing
said
Things
are
changing
around
here
Potter
noticed
said
Harry
coldly
Yerse
been
telling
Dumbledore
for
years
and
years
too
soft
with
you
all
said
Filch
chuckling
nastily
You
filthy
little
beasts
would
never
have
dropped
Stink
Pellets
you
known
had
power
whip
you
raw
would
you
now
Nobody
would
have
thought
throwing
Fanged
Frisbees
down
the
corridors
could
strung
you
the
ankles
office
would
they
But
when
Educational
Decree
Number
Twenty
nine
comes
Potter
allowed
them
things
and
she
asked
the
Minister
sign
order
for
the
expulsion
Peeves
things
are
going
very
different
around
here
withher
charge
Umbridge
had
obviously
gone
some
lengths
get
Filch
her
side
Harry
thought
and
the
worst
was
that
would
probably
prove
important
weapon
his
knowledge
the
school
secret
passageways
and
hiding
places
was
probably
second
only
that
the
Weasley
twins
Here
are
said
leering
down
Harry
rapped
three
times
Professor
Umbridge
door
and
pushed
open
The
Potter
boy
see
you
Umbridge
office
very
familiar
Harry
from
his
many
detentions
was
the
same
usual
except
for
the
large
wooden
block
lying
across
the
front
her
desk
which
golden
letters
spelled
the
word
HEADMISTRESS
Also
his
Firebolt
and
Fred
and
George
Cleansweeps
which
saw
with
pang
were
chained
and
padlocked
stout
iron
peg
the
wall
behind
the
desk
Umbridge
was
sitting
behind
the
desk
busily
scribbling
some
her
pink
parchment
but
she
looked
and
smiled
widely
their
entrance
Thank
you
Argus
she
said
sweetly
Not
all
not
all
said
Filch
bowing
low
his
rheumatism
would
permit
and
exiting
backwards
Sit
said
Umbridge
curtly
pointing
towards
chair
Harry
sat
She
continued
scribble
for
few
moments
watched
some
the
foul
kittens
gambolling
around
the
plates
over
her
head
wondering
what
fresh
horror
she
had
store
for
him
Well
now
she
said
finally
setting
down
her
quill
and
surveying
him
complacently
like
toad
about
swallow
particularly
juicy
fly
What
would
you
like
drink
What
said
Harry
quite
sure
had
misheard
her
drink
Potter
she
said
smiling
still
more
widely
Tea
Coffee
Pumpkin
juice
she
named
each
drink
she
gave
her
short
wand
wave
and
cup
glass
appeared
her
desk
Nothing
thank
you
said
Harry
wish
you
have
drink
with
she
said
her
voice
becoming
dangerously
sweet
Choose
one
Fine
tea
then
said
Harry
shrugging
She
got
and
made
quite
performance
adding
milk
with
her
back
him
She
then
bustled
around
the
desk
with
smiling
sinisterly
sweet
fashion
There
she
said
handing
him
Drink
before
gets
cold
won
you
Well
now
Potter
thought
ought
have
little
chat
after
the
distressing
events
last
night
said
nothing
She
settled
herself
back
into
her
seat
and
waited
When
several
long
moments
had
passed
silence
she
said
gaily
You
not
drinking
raised
the
cup
his
lips
and
then
just
suddenly
lowered
One
the
horrible
painted
kittens
behind
Umbridge
had
great
round
blue
eyes
just
like
Mad
Eye
Moody
magical
one
and
had
just
occurred
Harry
what
Mad
Eye
would
say
ever
heard
that
Harry
had
drunk
anything
offered
known
enemy
What
the
matter
said
Umbridge
who
was
still
watching
him
closely
you
want
sugar
said
Harry
raised
the
cup
his
lips
again
and
pretended
take
sip
though
keeping
his
mouth
tightly
closed
Umbridge
smile
widened
Good
she
whispered
Very
good
Now
then
She
leaned
forwards
little
Where
Albus
Dumbledore
idea
said
Harry
promptly
Drink
drink
she
said
still
smiling
Now
Potter
let
not
play
childish
games
know
that
you
know
where
has
gone
You
and
Dumbledore
have
been
this
together
from
the
beginning
Consider
your
position
Potter
don
know
where
Harry
repeated
pretended
drink
again
She
was
watching
him
very
closely
Very
well
she
said
though
she
looked
displeased
that
case
you
will
kindly
tell
the
whereabouts
Sirius
Black
Harry
stomach
turned
over
and
his
hand
holding
the
teacup
shook
that
rattled
its
saucer
tilted
the
cup
his
mouth
with
his
lips
pressed
together
that
some
the
hot
liquid
trickled
down
his
robes
don
know
said
little
too
quickly
Potter
said
Umbridge
let
remind
you
that
was
who
almost
caught
the
criminal
Black
the
Gryffindor
fire
October
know
perfectly
well
was
you
was
meeting
and
had
had
any
proof
neither
you
would
large
today
promise

Potter
whereis
Sirius
Black
idea
said
Harry
loudly
Haven
got
clue
They
stared
each
other
long
that
Harry
felt
his
eyes
watering
Then
Umbridge
stood
Very
well
Potter
will
take
your
word
for
this
time
but
warned
the
might
the
Ministry
stands
behind
All
channels
communication
and
out
this
school
are
being
monitored
Floo
Network
Regulator
keeping
watch
over
every
fire
Hogwarts
except

Inquisitorial

opening
and

all
owl
post
entering
and
leaving
the
castle
And
Filch
observing
all
secret
passages
and
out
the
castle
find
shred
evidence
BOOM
The
very
floor
the
office
shook
Umbridge
slipped
sideways
clutching
her
desk
for
support
and
looking
shocked
What
was
She
was
gazing
towards
the
door
Harry
took
the
opportunity
empty
his
almost
full
cup
tea
into
the
nearest
vase
dried
flowers
could
hear
people
running
and
screaming
several
floors
below
Back
lunch
you
Potter
cried
Umbridge
raising
her
wand
and
dashing
out
the
office
Harry
gave
her
few
seconds
start
then
hurried
after
her
see
what
the
source
all
the
uproar
was
was
not
difficult
find
One
floor
down
pandemonium
reigned
Somebody
and
Harry
had
very
shrewd
idea
who
had
set
off
what
seemed
enormous
crate
enchanted
fireworks
Dragons
comprised
entirely
green
and
gold
sparks
were
soaring
and
down
the
corridors
emitting
loud
fiery
blasts
and
bangs
they
went
shocking
pink
Catherine
wheels
five
feet
diameter
were
whizzing
lethally
through
the
air
like
many
flying
saucers
rockets
with
long
tails
brilliant
silver
stars
were
ricocheting
off
the
walls
sparklers
were
writing
swear
words
midair
their
own
accord
firecrackers
were
exploding
like
mines
everywhere
Harry
looked
and
instead
burning
themselves
out
fading
from
sight
fizzling
halt
these
pyrotechnical
miracles
seemed
gaining
energy
and
momentum
the
longer
watched
Filch
and
Umbridge
were
standing
apparently
transfixed
horror
halfway
down
the
stairs
Harry
watched
one
the
larger
Catherine
wheels
seemed
decide
that
what
needed
was
more
room
manoeuvre
whirled
towards
Umbridge
and
Filch
with
sinister
wheeeeeeeeee
They
both
yelled
with
fright
and
ducked
and
soared
straight
out
the
window
behind
them
and
off
across
the
grounds
Meanwhile
several
the
dragons
and
large
purple
bat
that
was
smoking
ominously
took
advantage
the
open
door
the
end
the
corridor
escape
towards
the
second
floor
Hurry
Filch
hurry
shrieked
Umbridge
they
all
over
the
school
unless
something
Stupefy
jet
red
light
shot
out
the
end
her
wand
and
hit
one
the
rockets
Instead
freezing
midair
exploded
with
such
force
that
blasted
hole
painting
soppy
looking
witch
the
middle
meadow
she
ran
for
just
time
reappearing
seconds
later
squashed
into
the
next
painting
where
couple
wizards
playing
cards
stood
hastily
make
room
for
her
Don
Stun
them
Filch
shouted
Umbridge
angrily
for
all
the
world
though
had
been
his
incantation
Right
you
are
Headmistress
wheezed
Filch
who
Squib
could
more
have
Stunned
the
fireworks
than
swallowed
them
dashed
nearby
cupboard
pulled
out
broom
and
began
swatting
the
fireworks
midair
within
seconds
the
head
the
broom
was
ablaze
Harry
had
seen
enough
laughing
ducked
down
low
ran
door
knew
was
concealed
behind
tapestry
little
way
along
the
corridor
and
slipped
through
find
Fred
and
George
hiding
just
behind
listening
Umbridge
and
Filch
yells
and
quaking
with
suppressed
mirth
Impressive
Harry
said
quietly
grinning
Very
impressive
you
put
Filibuster
out
business
problem
Cheers
whispered
George
wiping
tears
laughter
from
his
face
hope
she
tries
Vanishing
them
next
they
multiply
ten
every
time
you
try
The
fireworks
continued
burn
and
spread
all
over
the
school
that
afternoon
Though
they
caused
plenty
disruption
particularly
the
firecrackers
the
other
teachers
didn
seem
mind
them
very
much
Dear
dear
said
Professor
McGonagall
sardonically
one
the
dragons
soared
around
her
classroom
emitting
loud
bangs
and
exhaling
flame
Miss
Brown
would
you
mind
running
along
the
Headmistress
and
informing
her
that
have
escaped
firework
our
classroom
The
upshot
all
was
that
Professor
Umbridge
spent
her
first
afternoon
Headmistress
running
all
over
the
school
answering
the
summonses
the
other
teachers
none
whom
seemed
able
rid
their
rooms
the
fireworks
without
her
When
the
final
bell
rang
and
they
were
heading
back
Gryffindor
Tower
with
their
bags
Harry
saw
with
immense
satisfaction
dishevelled
and
soot
blackened
Umbridge
tottering
sweaty
faced
from
Professor
Flitwick
classroom
Thank
you
much
Professor
said
Professor
Flitwick
his
squeaky
little
voice
could
have
got
rid
the
sparklers
myself
course
but
wasn
sure
whether
not
had

Beaming
closed
his
classroom

her
snarling
face
Fred
and
George
were
heroes
that
night
the
Gryffindor

Even
Hermione
fought
her
way
through
the
excited
crowd
congratulate
them
They
were
wonderful
fireworks
she
said
admiringly
Thanks
said
George
looking
both
surprised
and
pleased
Weasleys

Whiz
bangs
Only
thing
used
our
whole
stock
going
have
start
again
from
scratch
now
was
worth
though
said
Fred
who
was
taking
orders
from
clamouring
Gryffindors
you
want
add
your
name
the
waiting
list
Hermione
five
Galleons
for
your
Basic
Blaze
box
and
twenty
for
the
Deflagration
Deluxe
Hermione
returned
the
table
where
Harry
and
Ron
were
sitting
staring
their
schoolbags
though
hoping
their
homework
would
spring
out
and
start
doing
itself
why
don
have
night
off
said
Hermione
brightly
silver
tailed
Weasley
rocket
zoomed
past
the
window
After
all
the
Easter
holidays
start
Friday
have
plenty
time
then
Are
you
feeling
all
right
Ron
asked
staring
her
disbelief
Now
you
mention
said
Hermione
happily
you
know
think
feeling
bit
rebellious
Harry
could
still
hear
the
distant
bangs
escaped
firecrackers
when
and
Ron
went
bed
hour
later
and
got
undressed
sparkler
floated
past
the
tower
still
resolutely
spelling
out
the
word
TOO
got
into
bed
yawning
With
his
glasses
off
the
occasional
firework
passing
the
window
had
become
blurred
looking
like
sparkling
clouds
beautiful
and
mysterious
against
the
black
sky
turned
his
side
wondering
how
Umbridge
was
feeling
about
her
first
day
Dumbledore
job
and
how
Fudge
would
react
when
heard
that
the
school
had
spent
most
the
day
state
advanced
disruption
Smiling
himself
Harry
closed
his
eyes
The
whizzes
and
bangs
escaped
fireworks
the
grounds
seemed
growing
more
distant
perhaps
was
simply
speeding
away
from
them
had
fallen
right
into
the
corridor
leading
the
Department
Mysteries
was
speeding
towards
the
plain
black
door
let
open
let
open
did
was
inside
the
circular
room
lined
with
doors
crossed
placed
his
hand
identical
door
and
swung
inwards
Now
was
long
rectangular
room
full
odd
mechanical
clicking
There
were
dancing
flecks
light
the
walls
but
did
not
pause
investigate
had
There
was
door
the
far
end
too
opened
his
touch
And
now
was
dimly
lit
room
high
and
wide
church
full
nothing
but
rows
and
rows
towering
shelves
each
laden
with
small
dusty
spun
glass
spheres
now
Harry
heart
was
beating
fast
with
excitement
knew
where
ran
forwards
but
his
footsteps
made
noise
the
enormous
deserted
room
There
was
something
this
room
wanted
very
very
much
Something
wanted
somebody
else
wanted
His
scar
was
hurting
BANG
Harry
awoke
instantly
confused
and
angry
The
dark
dormitory
was
full
the
sound
laughter
Cool
said
Seamus
who
was
silhouetted
against
the
window
think
one
those
Catherine
wheels
hit
rocket
and
like
they
mated
come
and
see
Harry
heard
Ron
and
Dean
scramble
out
bed
for
better
look
lay
quite
still
and
silent
while
the
pain
his
scar
subsided
and
disappointment
washed
over
him
felt
though
wonderful
treat
had
been
snatched
from
him
the
very
last
moment
had
got
close
that
time
Glittering
pink
and
silver
winged
piglets
were
now
soaring
past
the
windows
Gryffindor
Tower
Harry
lay
and
listened
the
appreciative
whoops
Gryffindors
the
dormitories
below
them
His
stomach
gave
sickening
jolt
remembered
that
had
Occlumency
the
following
evening
Harry
spent
the
whole
the
next
day
dreading
what
Snape
was
going
say
found
out
how
much
further
into
the
Department
Mysteries
Harry
had
penetrated
during
his
last
dream
With
surge
guilt
realised
that
had
not
practised
Occlumency
once
since
their
last
lesson
there
had
been
too
much
going
since
Dumbledore
had
left
was
sure
would
not
have
been
able
empty
his
mind
even
had
tried
doubted
however
whether
Snape
would
accept
that
excuse
attempted
little
last
minute
practice
during
classes
that
day
but
was
good
Hermione
kept
asking
him
what
was
wrong
whenever
fell
silent
trying
rid
himself
all
thought
and
emotion
and
after
all
the
best
moment
empty
his
brain
was
not
while
teachers
were
firing
revision
questions
the
class
Resigned
the
worst
set
off
for
Snape
office
after
dinner
Halfway
across
the
Entrance
Hall
however
Cho
came
hurrying
him
Over
here
said
Harry
glad
reason
postpone
his
meeting
with
Snape
and
beckoning
her
across
the
corner
the
Entrance
Hall
where
the
giant
hour
glasses
stood
Gryffindor
was
now
almost
empty
Are
you
Umbridge
hasn
been
asking
you
about
the
has
she
said
Cho
hurriedly
was
only
well
just
wanted
say
Harry
never
dreamed
Marietta
would
tell
Yeah
well
said
Harry
moodily
did
feel
Cho
might
have
chosen
her
friends
bit
more
carefully
was
small
consolation
that
the
last
had
heard
Marietta
was
still
the
hospital
wing
and
Madam
Pomfrey
had
not
been
able
make
the
slightest
improvement
her
pimples
She
lovely
person
really
said
Cho
She
just
made
mistake
Harry
looked
her
incredulously
lovely
person
who
made
mistake
She
sold
all
out
including
you
Well
all
got
away
didn
said
Cho
pleadingly
You
know
her
mum
works
for
the
Ministry
really
difficult
for
her
Ron
dad
works
for
the
Ministry
too
Harry
said
furiously
And
case
you
hadn
noticed
hasn
gotsneakwritten
across
his
face
That
was
really
horrible
trick
Hermione
Granger
said
Cho
fiercely
She
should
have
told
she
jinxed
that
list
think
was
brilliant
idea
said
Harry
coldly
Cho
flushed
and
her
eyes
grew
brighter
yes
forgot
course
was
darlingHermione
idea
Don
start
crying
again
said
Harry
warningly
wasn
going
she
shouted
Yeah
well
good
said
got
enough
cope
with
the
moment
and
cope
with
then
Cho
said
furiously
turning
her
heel
and
stalking
off
Fuming
Harry
descended
the
stairs
Snape
dungeon
and
though
knew
from
experience
how
much
easier
would
for
Snape
penetrate
his
mind
arrived
angry
and
resentful
succeeded
nothing
but
thinking
few
more
things
should
have
said
Cho
about
Marietta
before
reaching
the
dungeon
door
You
late
Potter
said
Snape
coldly
Harry
closed
the
door
behind
him
Snape
was
standing
with
his
back
Harry
removing
usual
certain
his
thoughts
and
placing
them
carefully
Dumbledore
Pensieve
dropped
the
last
silvery
strand
into
the
stone
basin
and
turned
face
Harry
said
Have
you
been
practising
Yes
Harry
lied
looking
carefully
one
the
legs
Snape
desk
Well
soon
find
out
won
said
Snape
smoothly
Wand
out
Potter
Harry
moved
into
his
usual
position
facing
Snape
with
the
desk
between
them
His
heart
was
pumping
fast
with
anger
Cho
and
anxiety
about
how
much
Snape
was
about
extract
from
his
mind
the
count
three
then
said
Snape
lazily
One
two
Snape
office
door
banged
open
and
Draco
Malfoy
sped
Professor
Snape
sir
sorry
Malfoy
was
looking
Snape
and
Harry
some
surprise
all
right
Draco
said
Snape
lowering
his
wand
Potter
here
for
little
remedial
Potions
Harry
had
not
seen
Malfoy
look
gleeful
since
Umbridge
had
turned
inspect
Hagrid
didn
know
said
leering
Harry
who
knew
his
face
was
burning
would
have
given
great
deal
able
shout
the
truth
Malfoy
even
better
hit
him
with
good
curse
Well
Draco
what
asked
Snape
Professor
Umbridge
sir
she
needs
your
help
said
Malfoy
They
found
Montague
sir
turned
jammed
inside
toilet
the
fourth
floor
How
did
get
there
demanded
Snape
don
know
sir
bit
confused
Very
well
very
well
Potter
said
Snape
shall
resume
this
lesson
tomorrow
evening
turned
and
swept
from
his
office
Malfoy
mouthed
Remedial
Potions
Harry
behind
Snape
back
before
following
him
Seething
Harry
replaced
his
wand
inside
his
robes
and
made
leave
the
room
least
had
twenty
four
more
hours
which
practise
knew
ought
feel
grateful
for
the
narrow
escape
though
was
hard
that
came
the
expense
Malfoy
telling
the
whole
school
that
needed
remedial
Potions
was
the
office
door
when
saw
patch
shivering
light
dancing
the
doorframe
stopped
and
stood
looking
reminded
something
then
remembered
was
little
like
the
lights
had
seen
his
dream
last
night
the
lights
the
second
room
had
walked
through
his
journey
through
the
Department
Mysteries
turned
around
The
light
was
coming
from
the
Pensieve
sitting
Snape
desk
The
silver
white
contents
were
ebbing
and
swirling
within
Snape
thoughts
things
did
not
want
Harry
see
broke
through
Snape
defences
accidentally
Harry
gazed
the
Pensieve
curiosity
welling
inside
him
what
was
that
Snape
was
keen
hide
from
Harry
The
silvery
lights
shivered
the
wall
Harry
took
two
steps
towards
the
desk
thinking
hard
Could
possibly
information
about
the
Department
Mysteries
that
Snape
was
determined
keep
from
him
Harry
looked
over
his
shoulder
his
heart
now
pumping
harder
and
faster
than
ever
How
long
would
take
Snape
release
Montague
from
the
toilet
Would
come
straight
back
his
office
afterwards
accompany
Montague
the
hospital
wing
Surely
the
latter
Montague
was
Captain
the
Slytherin
Quidditch
team
Snape
would
want
make
sure
was
all
right
Harry
walked
the
remaining
few
feet
the
Pensieve
and
stood
over
gazing
into
its
depths
hesitated
listening
then
pulled
out
his
wand
again
The
office
and
the
corridor
beyond
were
completely
silent
gave
the
contents
the
Pensieve
small
prod
with
the
end
his
wand
The
silvery
stuff
within
began
swirl
very
fast
Harry
leaned
forwards
over
and
saw
that
had
become
transparent
was
once
again
looking
down
into
room
though
through
circular
window
the
ceiling
fact
unless
was
much
mistaken
was
looking
down
into
the
Great
Hall
His
breath
was
actually
fogging
the
surface
Snape
thoughts
his
brain
seemed
limbo
would
insane
the
thing
was
strongly
tempted
was
trembling
Snape
could
back
any
moment
but
Harry
thought
Cho
anger
Malfoy
jeering
face
and
reckless
daring
seized
him
took
great
gulp
breath
and
plunged
his
face
into
the
surface
Snape
thoughts
once
the
floor
the
office
lurched
tipping
Harry
head
first
into
the
Pensieve
was
falling
through
cold
blackness
spinning
furiously
went
and
then
was
standing
the
middle
the
Great
Hall
but
the
four
house
tables
were
gone
Instead
there
were
more
than
hundred
smaller
tables
all
facing
the
same
way
each
which
sat
student
head
bent
low
scribbling
roll
parchment
The
only
sound
was
the
scratching
quills
and
the
occasional
rustle
somebody
adjusted
their
parchment
was
clearly
exam
time
Sunshine
was
streaming
through
the
high
windows
the
bent
heads
which
shone
chestnut
and
copper
and
gold
the
bright
light
Harry
looked
around
carefully
Snape
had
here
somewhere
this
was
his
memory
And
there
was
table
right
behind
Harry
Harry
stared
Snape
the
teenager
had
stringy
pallid
look
about
him
like
plant
kept
the
dark
His
hair
was
lank
and
greasy
and
was
flopping
the
table
his
hooked
nose
barely
half
inch
from
the
surface
the
parchment
scribbled
Harry
moved
around
behind
Snape
and
read
the
heading
the
examination
paper
DEFENCE
AGAINST
THE
DARK
ARTS
ORDINARY
WIZARDING
LEVEL
Snape
had
fifteen
sixteen
around
Harry
own
age
His
hand
was
flying
across
the
parchment
had
written
least
foot
more
than
his
closest
neighbours
and
yet
his
writing
was
minuscule
and
cramped
Five
more
minutes
The
voice
made
Harry
jump
Turning
saw
the
top
Professor
Flitwick
head
moving
between
the
desks
short
distance
away
Professor
Flitwick
was
walking
past
boy
with
untidy
black
hair
very
untidy
black
hair
Harry
moved
quickly
that
had
been
solid
would
have
knocked
desks
flying
Instead
seemed
slide
dreamlike
across
two
aisles
and
third
The
back
the
black
haired
boy
head
drew
nearer
and
was
straightening
now
putting
down
his
quill
pulling
his
roll
parchment
towards
him
reread
what
had
written
Harry
stopped
front
the
desk
and
gazed
down
his
fifteen
year
old
father
Excitement
exploded
the
pit
his
stomach
was
though
was
looking
himself
but
with
deliberate
mistakes
James
eyes
were
hazel
his
nose
was
slightly
longer
than
Harry
and
there
was
scar
his
forehead
but
they
had
the
same
thin
face
same
mouth
same
eyebrows
James
hair
stuck
the
back
exactly
Harry
did
his
hands
could
have
been
Harry
and
Harry
could
tell
that
when
James
stood
they
would
within
inch
each
other
height
James
yawned
hugely
and
rumpled
his
hair
making
even
messier
than
had
been
Then
with
glance
towards
Professor
Flitwick
turned
his
seat
and
grinned
boy
sitting
four
seats
behind
him
With
another
shock
excitement
Harry
saw
Sirius
give
James
the
thumbs
Sirius
was
lounging
his
chair
his
ease
tilting
back
two
legs
was
very
good
looking
his
dark
hair
fell
into
his
eyes
with
sort
casual
elegance
neither
James
nor
Harry
could
ever
have
achieved
and
girl
sitting
behind
him
was
eyeing
him
hopefully
though
didn
seem
have
noticed
And
two
seats
along
from
this
girl
Harry
stomach
gave
another
pleasurable
squirm
was
Remus
Lupin
looked
rather
pale
and
peaky
was
the
full
moon
approaching
and
was
absorbed
the
exam
reread
his
answers
scratched
his
chin
with
the
end
his
quill
frowning
slightly
that
meant
Wormtail
had
around
here
somewhere
too
and
sure
enough
Harry
spotted
him
within
seconds
small
mousy
haired
boy
with
pointed
nose
Wormtail
looked
anxious
was
chewing
his
fingernails
staring
down
his
paper
scuffing
the
ground
with
his
toes
Every
now
and
then
glanced
hopefully
his
neighbour
paper
Harry
stared
Wormtail
for
moment
then
back
James
who
was
now
doodling
bit
scrap
parchment
had
drawn
Snitch
and
was
now
tracing
the
letters
What
did
they
stand
for
Quills
down
please
squeaked
Professor
Flitwick
That
means
you
too
Stebbins
Please
remain
seated
while
collect
your
parchment
Accio
Over
hundred
rolls
parchment
zoomed
into
the
air
and
into
Professor
Flitwick
outstretched
arms
knocking
him
backwards
off
his
feet
Several
people
laughed
couple
students
the
front
desks
got
took
hold
Professor
Flitwick
beneath
the
elbows
and
lifted
him
back
his
feet
Thank
you
thank
you
panted
Professor
Flitwick
Very
well
everybody
you
free
Harry
looked
down
his
father
who
had
hastily
crossed
out
the
had
been
embellishing
jumped
his
feet
stuffed
his
quill
and
the
exam
paper
into
his
bag
which
slung
over
his
back
and
stood
waiting
for
Sirius
join
him
Harry
looked
around
and
glimpsed
Snape
short
way
away
moving
between
the
tables
towards
the
doors
the
Entrance
Hall
still
absorbed
his
own
exam
paper
Round
shouldered
yet
angular
walked
twitchy
manner
that
recalled
spider
and
his
oily
hair
was
jumping
about
his
face
gang
chattering
girls
separated
Snape
from
James
Sirius
and
Lupin
and
planting
himself
their
midst
Harry
managed
keep
Snape
sight
while
straining
his
ears
catch
the
voices
James
and
his
friends
Did
you
like
question
ten
Moony
asked
Sirius
they
emerged
into
the
Entrance
Hall
Loved
said
Lupin
briskly
Give
five
signs
that
identify
the
werewolf
Excellent
question
you
think
you
managed
get
all
the
signs
said
James
tones
mock
concern
Think
did
said
Lupin
seriously
they
joined
the
crowd
thronging
around
the
front
doors
eager
get
out
into
the
sunlit
grounds
One
sitting
chair
Two
wearing
clothes
Three
his
name
Remus
Lupin
Wormtail
was
the
only
one
who
didn
laugh
got
the
snout
shape
the
pupils
the
eyes
and
the
tufted
tail
said
anxiously
but
couldn
think
what
else
How
thick
are
you
Wormtail
said
James
impatiently
You
run
round
with
werewolf
once
month
Keep
your
voice
down
implored
Lupin
Harry
looked
anxiously
behind
him
again
Snape
remained
close
still
buried
his
exam
questions
but
this
was
Snape
memory
and
Harry
was
sure
that
Snape
chose
wander
off
different
direction
once
outside
the
grounds
Harry
would
not
able
follow
James
any
further
his
intense
relief
however
when
James
and
his
three
friends
strode
off
down
the
lawn
towards
thelake
Snape
followed
still
poring
over
the
exam
paper
and
apparently
with
fixed
idea
where
was
going
keeping
little
ahead
him
Harry
managed
maintain
close
watch
James
and
the
others
Well
thought
that
paper
was
piece
cake
heard
Sirius
say
surprised
don
get
Outstanding
least
too
said
James
put
his
hand
his
pocket
and
took
out
struggling
Golden
Snitch
Where
you
get
that
Nicked
said
James
casually
started
playing
with
the
Snitch
allowing
fly
much
foot
away
before
seizing
again
his
reflexes
were
excellent
Wormtail
watched
him
awe
They
stopped
the
shade
the
very
same
beech
tree
the
edge
the
lake
where
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
once
spent
Sunday
finishing
their
homework
and
threw
themselves
down
the
grass
Harry
looked
over
his
shoulder
yet
again
and
saw
his
delight
that
Snape
had
settled
himself
the
grass
the
dense
shadow
clump
bushes
was
deeply
immersed
the
paper
ever
which
left
Harry
free
sit
down
the
grass
between
the
beech
and
the
bushes
and
watch
the
foursome
under
the
tree
The
sunlight
was
dazzling
the
smooth
surface
the
lake
the
bank
which
the
group
laughing
girls
who
had
just
left
the
Great
Hall
were
sitting
with
their
shoes
and
socks
off
cooling
their
feet
the
water
Lupin
had
pulled
out
book
and
was
reading
Sirius
stared
around
the
students
milling
over
the
grass
looking
rather
haughty
and
bored
but
very
handsomely
James
was
still
playing
with
the
Snitch
letting
zoom
further
and
further
away
almost
escaping
but
always
grabbed
the
last
second
Wormtail
was
watching
him
with
his
mouth
open
Every
time
James
made
particularly
difficult
catch
Wormtail
gasped
and
applauded
After
five
minutes
this
Harry
wondered
why
James
didn
tell
Wormtail
get
grip
himself
but
James
seemed
enjoying
the
attention
Harry
noticed
that
his
father
had
habit
rumpling
his
hair
though
keep
from
getting
too
tidy
and
also
kept
looking
over
the
girls
the
water
edge
Tut
that
away
will
you
said
Sirius
finally
James
made
fine
catch
and
Wormtail
let
out
cheer
before
Wormtail
wets
himself
with
excitement
Wormtail
turned
slightly
pink
but
James
grinned
bothers
you
said
stuffing
the
Snitch
back
his
pocket
Harry
had
the
distinct
impression
that
Sirius
was
the
only
one
for
whom
James
would
have
stopped
showing
off
bored
said
Sirius
Wish
was
full
moon
You
might
said
Lupin
darkly
from
behind
his
book
still
got
Transfiguration
you
bored
you
could
test
Here
and
held
out
his
book
But
Sirius
snorted
don
need
look
that
rubbish
know
all
This
liven
you
Padfoot
said
James
quietly
Look
who
Sirius
head
turned
became
very
still
like
dog
that
has
scented
rabbit
Excellent
said
softly
Snivellus
Harry
turned
see
what
Sirius
was
looking
Snape
was
his
feet
again
and
was
stowing
the
paper
his
bag
left
the
shadows
the
bushes
and
set
off
across
the
grass
Sirius
and
James
stood
Lupin
and
Wormtail
remained
sitting
Lupin
was
still
staring
down
his
book
though
his
eyes
were
not
moving
and
faint
frown
line
had
appeared
between
his
eyebrows
Wormtail
was
looking
from
Sirius
and
James
Snape
with
look
avid
anticipation
his
face
All
right
Snivellus
said
James
loudly
Snape
reacted
fast
was
though
had
been
expecting
attack
dropping
his
bag
plunged
his
hand
inside
his
robes
and
his
wand
was
halfway
into
the
air
when
James
shouted
Expelliarmus
Snape
wand
flew
twelve
feet
into
the
air
and
fell
with
little
thud
the
grass
behind
him
Sirius
let
out
bark
laughter
Impedimenta
said
pointing
his
wand
Snape
who
was
knocked
off
his
feet
halfway
through
dive
towards
his
own
fallen
wand
Students
all
around
had
turned
watch
Some
them
had
got
their
feet
and
were
edging
nearer
Some
looked
apprehensive
others
entertained
Snape
lay
panting
the
ground
James
and
Sirius
advanced
him
wands
raised
James
glancing
over
his
shoulder
the
girls
the
water
edge
went
Wormtail
was
his
feet
now
watching
hungrily
edging
around
Lupin
get
clearer
view
How
the
exam
Snivelly
said
James
was
watching
him
his
nose
was
touching
the
parchment
said
Sirius
viciously
There
great
grease
marks
all
over
they
won
able
read
word
Several
people
watching
laughed
Snape
was
clearly
unpopular
Wormtail
sniggered
shrilly
Snape
was
trying
get
but
the
jinx
was
still
operating
him
was
struggling
though
bound
invisible
ropes
You
wait
panted
staring
James
with
expression
purest
loathing
you
wait
Wait
for
what
said
Sirius
coolly
What
you
going
Snivelly
wipe
your
nose
Snape
let
out
stream
mixed
swear
words
and
hexes
but
with
his
wand
ten
feet
away
nothing
happened
Wash
out
your
mouth
said
James
coldly
Scourgify
Pink
soap
bubbles
streamed
from
Snape
mouth
once
the
froth
was
covering
his
lips
making
him
gag
choking
him
Leave
him
ALONE
James
and
Sirius
looked
round
James
free
hand
immediately
jumped
his
hair
was
one
the
girls
from
the
lake
edge
She
had
thick
dark
red
hair
that
fell
her
shoulders
and
startlingly
green
almond
shaped
eyes
Harry
eyes
Harry
mother
All
right
Evans
said
James
and
the
tone
his
voice
was
suddenly
pleasant
deeper
more
mature
Leave
him
alone
Lily
repeated
She
was
looking
James
with
every
sign
great
dislike
What
done
you
Well
said
James
appearing
deliberate
the
point
more
the
fact
that
exists
you
know
what
mean
Many
the
surrounding
students
laughed
Sirius
and
Wormtail
included
but
Lupin
still
apparently
intent
his
book
didn
and
nor
did
Lily
You
think
you
funny
she
said
coldly
But

just
arrogant
bullying
toerag
Potter
Leave
himalone

with
Evans
said
James
quickly
out
with
and
never
lay
wand
old
Snivelly
again
Behind
him
the
Impediment
Jinx
was
wearing
off
Snape
was
beginning
inch
towards
his
fallen
wand
spitting
out
soapsuds
crawled
wouldn
out
with
you
was
choice
between
you
and
the
giant
squid
said
Lily
Bad
luck
Prongs
said
Sirius
briskly
and
turned
back
Snape
But
too
late
Snape
had
directed
his
wand
straight
James
there
was
flash
light
and
gash
appeared
the
side
James
face
spattering
his
robes
with
blood
James
whirled
about
second
flash
light
later
Snape
was
hanging
upside
down
the
air
his
robes
falling
over
his
head
reveal
skinny
pallid
legs
and
pair
greying
underpants
Many
people
the
small
crowd
cheered
Sirius
James
and
Wormtail
roared
with
laughter
Lily
whose
furious
expression
had
twitched
for
instant
though
she
was
going
smile
said
Let
him
down
Certainly
said
James
and
jerked
his
wand
upwards
Snape
fell
into
crumpled
heap
the
ground
Disentangling
himself
from
his
robes
got
quickly
his
feet
wand
but
Sirius
said
Petrificus
Totalus
and
Snape
keeled
over
again
rigid
board
LEAVE
HIM
ALONE
Lily
shouted
She
had
her
own
wand
out
now
James
and
Sirius
eyed
warily
Evans
don
make
hex
you
said
James
earnestly
Take
the
curse
off
him
then
James
sighed
deeply
then
turned
Snape
and
muttered
the
counter
curse
There
you
said
Snape
struggled
his
feet
You

Evans
was
here
Snivellus

little
Mudbloods

Lily
blinked
Fine

And
wash

pants

Snivellus
Apologise
Evans
James
roared
Snape
his
wand
pointed
threateningly
him
don
want

make
him
apologise
Lily
shouted
rounding
James
You

What
yelped
James
NEVER

you
you

what
Messing
your
hair
because
you
think
looks
cool
look
like
you
just
got
off
your
broomstick
showing
off
with
that
stupid
Snitch
walking
down
corridors
and
hexing
anyone
who
annoys
you
just
because
you
can
surprised
your
broomstick
can
get
off
the
ground
with
that
fat
head
You
make
SICK
She
turned
her
heel
and
hurried
away
Evans
James
shouted
after
her
Hey
EVANS
But
she
didn
look
back
What
with
her
said
James
trying
and
failing
look
though
this
was
throwaway
question
real
importance
him
Reading
between
the
lines
say
she
thinks
you
bit
conceited
mate
said
Sirius
Right
said
James
who
looked
furious
now
right
There
was
another
flash
light
and
Snape
was
once
again
hanging
upside
down
the
air
Who
wants
see
take
off
Snivelly
pants
But
whether
James
really
did
take
off
Snapes
pants
Harry
never
found
out
hand
had
closed
tight
over
his
upper
arm
closed
with
pincer
like
grip
Wincing
Harry
looked
round
see
who
had
hold
him
and
saw
with
thrill
horror
fully
grown
adult
sized
Snape
standing
right
beside
him
white
with
rage
Having
fun
Harry
felt
himself
rising
into
the
air
the
summer
day
evaporated
around
him
was
floating
upwards
through
icy
blackness
Snape
hand
still
tight
upon
his
upper
arm
Then
with
swooping
feeling
though
had
turned
head
over
heels
midair
his
feet
hit
the
stone
floor
Snape
dungeon
and
was
standing
again
beside
the
Pensieve
Snape
desk
the
shadowy
present
day
Potion
masters
study
said
Snape
gripping
Harry
arm
tightly
Harry
hand
was
starting
feel
numb
been
enjoying
yourself
Potter
said
Harry
trying
free
his
arm
was
scary
Snape
lips
were
shaking
his
face
was
white
his
teeth
were
bared
Amusing
man
your
father
wasn
said
Snape
shaking
Harry
hard
his
glasses
slipped
down
his
nose
didn
Snape
threw
Harry
from
him
with
all
his
might
Harry
fell
hard
the
dungeon
floor
You
will
not
repeat
what
you
saw
anybody
Snape
bellowed
said
Harry
getting
his
feet
far
from
Snape
could
course
Get
out
get
out
don
want
see
you
this
office
ever
again
And
Harry
hurtled
towards
the
door
jar
dead
cockroaches
exploded
over
his
head
wrenched
the
door
open
and
flew
along
the
corridor
stopping
only
when
had
put
three
floors
between
himself
and
Snape
There
leaned
against
the
wall
panting
and
rubbing
his
bruised
arm
had
desire
all
return
Gryffindor
Tower
early
nor
tell
Ron
and
Hermione
what
had
just
seen
What
was
making
Harry
feel
horrified
and
unhappy
was
not
being
shouted
having
jars
thrown
him
was
that
knew
how
felt
humiliated
the
middle
circle
onlookers
knew
exactly
how
Snape
had
felt
his
father
had
taunted
him
and
that
judging
from
what
had
just
seen
his
father
had
been
every
bit
arrogant
Snape
had
always
told
him
CAREERS
ADVICE
But
why
haven
you
got
Occlumency
lessons
any
more
said
Hermione
frowning
vetold
you
Harry
muttered
Snape
reckons
can
carry
myself
now
got
the
basics
you
stopped
having
funny
dreams
said
Hermione
sceptically
Pretty
much
said
Harry
not
looking
her
Well
don
think
Snape
should
stop
until
you
absolutely
sure
you
can
control
them
said
Hermione
indignantly
Harry
think
you
should
back
him
and
ask
said
Harry
forcefully
Just
drop
Hermione
was
the
first
day
the
Easter
holidays
and
Hermione
was
her
custom
had
spent
large
part
the
day
drawing
revision
timetables
for
the
three
them
Harry
and
Ron
had
let
her
was
easier
than
arguing
with
her
and
any
case
they
might
come
useful
Ron
had
been
startled
discover
there
were
only
six
weeks
left
until
their
exams
How
can
that
come
shock
Hermione
demanded
she
tapped
each
little
square
Ron
timetable
with
her
wand
that
flashed
different
colour
according
its
subject
dunno
said
Ron
there
been
lot
going
Well
there
you
are
she
said
handing
him
his
timetable
you
follow
that
you
should
fine
Ron
looked
down
gloomily
but
then
brightened
You
given
evening
off
every
week
That
for
Quidditch
practice
said
Hermione
The
smile
faded
from
Ron
face
What
the
point
said
dully
got
about
much
chance
winning
the
Quidditch
Cup
this
year
Dad
got
becoming
Minister
for
Magic
Hermione
said
nothing
she
was
looking
Harry
who
was
staring
blankly
the
opposite
wall
the
common
room
while
Crookshanks
pawed
his
hand
trying
get
his
ears
scratched
What
wrong
Harry
What
said
quickly
Nothing
seized
his
copy
ofDefensive
Magical
Theory
and
pretended
looking
something
the
index
Crookshanks
gave
him
bad
job
and
slunk
away
under
Hermione
chair
saw
Cho
earlier
said
Hermione
tentatively
She
looked
really
miserable
too
have
you
two
had
row
again
Wha
yeah
have
said
Harry
seizing
gratefully
the
excuse
What
about
That
sneak
friend
hers
Marietta
said
Harry
Yeah
well
don
blame
you
said
Ron
angrily
setting
down
his
revision
timetable
hadn
been
for
her
Ron
went
into
rant
about
Marietta
Edgecombe
which
Harry
found
helpful
all
had
was
look
angry
nod
and
say
Yeah
and
That
right
whenever
Ron
drew
breath
leaving
his
mind
free
dwell
ever
more
miserably
what
had
seen
the
Pensieve
felt
though
the
memory
was
eating
him
from
inside
had
been
sure
his
parents
were
wonderful
people
that
had
never
had
the
slightest
difficulty
disbelieving
the
aspersions
Snape
cast
his
father
character
Hadn
people
like
Hagrid
and
Siriustold
Harry
how
wonderful
his
father
had
been
Yeah
well
look
what
Sirius
was
like
himself
said
nagging
voice
inside
Harry
head
was
bad
wasn
Yes
had
once
overheard
Professor
McGonagall
saying
that
his
father
and
Sirius
had
been
troublemakers
school
but
she
had
described
them
forerunners
the
Weasley
twins
and
Harry
could
not
imagine
Fred
and
George
dangling
someone
upside
down
for
the
fun
not
unless
they
really
loathed
them
perhaps
Malfoy
somebody
who
really
deserved
Harry
tried
make
case
for
Snape
having
deserved
what
had
suffered
James
hands
but
hadn
Lily
asked
What
done
you
And
hadn
James
replied
more
the
fact
that
exists
you
know
what
mean
Hadn
James
started
all
simply
because
Sirius
had
said
was
bored
Harry
remembered
Lupin
saying
back
Grimmauld
Place
that
Dumbledore
had
made
him
prefect
the
hope
that
would
able
exercise
some
control
over
James
and
Sirius
but
the
Pensieve
had
sat
there
and
let
all
happen
Harry
kept
reminding
himself
that
Lily
had
intervened
his
mother
had
been
decent
Yet
the
memory
the
look
her
face
she
had
shouted
James
disturbed
him
quite
much
anything
else
she
had
clearly
loathed
James
and
Harry
simply
could
not
understand
how
they
could
have
ended
married
Once
twice
even
wondered
whether
James
had
forced
her
into
For
nearly
five
years
the
thought
his
father
had
been
source
comfort
inspiration
Whenever
someone
had
told
him
was
like
James
had
glowed
with
pride
inside
And
now
now
felt
cold
and
miserable
the
thought
him
The
weather
grew
breezier
brighter
and
warmer
the
Easter
holidays
passed
but
Harry
along
with
the
rest
the
fifth
and
seventh
years
was
trapped
inside
revising
traipsing
back
and
forth
the
library
Harry
pretended
his
bad
mood
had
other
cause
but
the
approaching
exams
and
his
fellow
Gryffindors
were
sick
studying
themselves
his
excuse
went
unchallenged
Harry
talking
you
can
you
hear
Huh
looked
round
Ginny
Weasley
looking
very
windswept
had
joined
him
the
library
table
where
had
been
sitting
alone
was
late
Sunday
evening
Hermione
had
gone
back
Gryffindor
Tower
revise
Ancient
Runes
and
Ron
had
Quidditch
practice
said
Harry
pulling
his
books
towards
him
How
come
you
not
practice
over
said
Ginny
Ron
had
take
Jack
Sloper
the
hospital
wing
Why
Well
not
sure
but
wethink
knocked
himself
out
with
his
own
bat
She
sighed
heavily
Anyway
package
just
arrived
only
just
got
through
Umbridge
new
screening
process
She
hoisted
box
wrapped
brown
paper
the
table
had
clearly
been
unwrapped
and
carelessly
wrapped
There
was
scribbled
note
across
red
ink
reading
Inspected
and
Passed
the
Hogwarts
High
Inquisitor
Easter
eggs
from
Mum
said
Ginny
There
one
for
you
there
you
She
handed
him
handsome
chocolate
egg
decorated
with
small
iced
Snitches
and
according
the
packaging
containing
bag
Fizzing
Whizzbees
Harry
looked
for
moment
then
his
horror
felt
lump
rise
his
throat
Are
you
Harry
Ginny
asked
quietly
Yeah
fine
said
Harry
gruffly
The
lump
his
throat
was
painful
did
not
understand
why
Easter
egg
should
have
made
him
feel
like
this
You
seem
really
down
lately
Ginny
persisted
You
know
sure
you
justtalked
Cho
not
Cho
want
talk
said
Harry
brusquely
Who
then
asked
Ginny
watching
him
closely
glanced
around
make
quite
sure
nobody
was
listening
Madam
Pince
was
several
shelves
away
stamping
out
pile
books
for
frantic
looking
Hannah
Abbott
wish
could
talk
Sirius
muttered
But
know
can
Ginny
continued
watch
him
thoughtfully
More
give
himself
something
than
because
really
wanted
any
Harry
unwrapped
his
Easter
egg
broke
off
large
bit
and
put
into
his
mouth
Well
said
Ginny
slowly
helping
herself
bit
egg
too
you
really
want
talk
Sirius
expect
could
think
way
Come
said
Harry
dully
With
Umbridge
policing
the
fires
and
reading
all
our
mail
The
thing
about
growing
with
Fred
and
George
said
Ginny
thoughtfully
that
you
sort
start
thinking
anything
possible
you
got
enough
nerve
Harry
looked
her
Perhaps
was
the
effect
the
chocolate
Lupin
had
always
advised
eating
some
after
encounters
with
Dementors
simply
because
had
finally
spoken
aloud
the
wish
that
had
been
burning
inside
him

Ginny

Chocolate

whipping

Hermione
absently
She

over

orange
leaflet
that
was
headed

Hey

voice
Harry

looked
round
Fred
and
George

come

them
Ginny
had
word
with
about
you
said
Fred
stretching
out
his
legs
the
table
front
them
and
causing
several
booklets
careers
with
the
Ministry
Magic
slide
off
the
floor
She
says
you
need

Sirius
What
said
Hermione
sharply
freezing
with
her
hand
halfway
towards
picking
MAKE

THE
DEPARTMENT
MAGICAL
ACCIDENTS
AND
CATASTROPHES
Yeah
said
Harry
trying
sound
casual
yeah
thought
like
Don
ridiculous
said
Hermione
straightening
and
looking
him
though
she
could
not
believe
her
eyes
With
Umbridge
groping
around
the
fires
and
frisking
all
the
owls
Well
think
can
find
way
around
that
said
George
stretching
and
smiling
simple
matter
causing
diversion
Now
you
might
have
noticed
that
have
been
rather
quiet
the
mayhem
front
during
the
Easter
holidays
What
was
the
point
asked
ourselves
disrupting
leisure
time
continued
Fred
point
all
answered
ourselves
And
course
have
messed
people
revision
too
which
would
the
very
last
thing
want
gave
Hermione
sanctimonious
little
nod
She
looked
rather
taken
aback
this
thoughtfulness
But
business
usual
from
tomorrow
Fred
continued
briskly
And
going
causing
bit
uproar
why
not
that
Harry
can
have
his
chat
with
Sirius
Yes
butstill
said
Hermione
with
air
explaining
something
very
simple
somebody
very
obtuse
even
youdo
cause
diversion
how
Harry
supposed
talk
him
Umbridge
office
said
Harry
quietly
had
been
thinking
about
for
fortnight
and
could
come
with
alternative
Umbridge
herself
had
told
him
that
the
only
fire
that
was
not
being
watched
was
her
own
Are
you
insane
said
Hermione
hushed
voice
Ron
had
lowered
his
leaflet
jobs
the
Cultivated
Fungus
Trade
and
was
watching
the
conversation
warily
don
think
said
Harry
shrugging
And
how
are
you
going
get
there
the
first
place
Harry
was
ready
for
this
question
Sirius
knife
said
Excuse
Christmas
before
last
Sirius
gave
knife
that
open
any
lock
said
Harry
even
she
bewitched
the
door
soAlohomora
won
work
which
bet
she
has
What
you
think
about
this
Hermione
demanded
Ron
and
Harry
was
reminded
irresistibly
Mrs
Weasley
appealing
her
husband
during
Harry
first
dinner
Grimmauld
Place
dunno
said
Ron
looking
alarmed
being
asked
give
opinion
Harry
wants
him
isn
Spoken
like
true
friend
and
Weasley
said
Fred
clapping
Ron
hard
the
back
Right
then
thinking
doing
tomorrow
just
after
lessons
because
should
cause
maximum
impact
everybody
the
corridors
Harry
set
off
the
east
wing
somewhere
draw
herright
away
from
her
own
office
reckon
should
able
guarantee
you
what
twenty
minutes
said
looking
George
Easy
said
George
What
sort
diversion
asked
Ron
You
see
little
bro
said
Fred
and
George
got
again
least
you
will
you
trot
along
Gregory
the
Smarmy
corridor
round
about
five
clock
tomorrow
Harry
awoke
very
early
the
next
day
feeling
almost
anxious
had
done
the
morning
his
disciplinary
hearing
the
Ministry
Magic
was
not
only
the
prospect
breaking
into
Umbridge
office
and
using
her
fire
speak
Sirius
that
was
making
him
feel
nervous
though
that
was
certainly
bad
enough
today
also
happened
the
first
time
Harry
would
close
proximity
Snape
since
Snape
had
thrown
him
out
his
office
After
lying
bed
for
while
thinking
about
the
day
ahead
Harry
got
very
quietly
and
moved
across
the
window
beside
Nevilles
bed
and
stared
out
truly
glorious
morning
The
sky
was
clear
misty
opalescent
blue
Directly
ahead
him
Harry
could
see
the
towering
beech
tree
below
which
his
father
had
once
tormented
Snape
was
not
sure
what
Sirius
could
possibly
say
him
that
would
make
for
what
had
seen
the
Pensieve
but
was
desperate
hear
Sirius
own
account
what
had
happened
know
any
mitigating
factors
there
might
have
been
any
excuse
all
for
his
father
behaviour
Something
caught
Harry
attention
movement
the
edge
the
Forbidden
Forest
Harry
squinted
into
the
sun
and
saw
Hagrid
emerging
from
between
the
trees
seemed
limping
Harry
watched
Hagrid
staggered
the
door
his
cabin
and
disappeared
inside
Harry
watched
the
cabin
for
several
minutes
Hagrid
did
not
emerge
again
but
smoke
furled
from
the
chimney
Hagrid
could
not
badly
injured
that
was
unequal
stoking
the
fire
Harry
turned
away
from
the
window
headed
back
his
trunk
and
started
dress
With
the
prospect
forcing
entry
into
Umbridge
office
ahead
Harry
had
never
expected
the
day
restful
one
but
had
not
reckoned
Hermione
almost
continual
attempts
dissuade
him
from
what
was
planning
five
clock
For
the
first
time
ever
she
was
least
inattentive
Professor
Binns
History
Magic
Harry
and
Ron
were
keeping
stream
whispered
admonitions
that
Harry
tried
very
hard
ignore
and
she
does
catch
you
there
apart
from
being
expelled
she
able
guess
you
been
talking
Snuffles
and
this
time
expect
she
llforce
you
drink
Veritaserum
and
answer
her
questions
Hermione
said
Ron
low
and
indignant
voice
are
you
going
stop
telling
Harry
off
and
listen
Binns
going
have
take
own
notes
You
take
notes
for
change
won
kill
you
the
time
they
reached
the
dungeons
neither
Harry
nor
Ron
was
speaking
Hermione
Undeterred
she
took
advantage
their
silence
maintain
uninterrupted
flow
dire
warnings
all
uttered
under
her
breath
vehement
hiss
that
caused
Seamus
waste
five
whole
minutes
checking
his
cauldron
for
leaks
Snape
meanwhile
seemed
have
decided
act
though
Harry
were
invisible
Harry
was
course
well
used
this
tactic
was
one
Uncle
Vernon
favourites
and
the
whole
was
grateful
had
suffer
nothing
worse
fact
compared
what
usually
had
endure
from
Snape
the
way
taunts
and
snide
remarks
found
the
new
approach
something
improvement
and
was
pleased
find
that
when
left
well
alone
was
able
concoct
Invigoration
Draught
quite
easily
the
end
the
lesson
scooped
some
the
potion
into
flask
corked
and
took
Snape
desk
for
marking
feeling
that
might
last
have
scraped
had
just
turned
away
when
heard
smashing
noise
Malfoy
gave
gleeful
yell
laughter
Harry
whipped
around
His
potion
sample
lay
pieces
the
floor
and
Snape
was
surveying
him
with
look
gloating
pleasure
Whoops
said
softly
Another
zero
then
Potter
Harry
was
too
incensed
speak
strode
back
his
cauldron
intending
fill
another
flask
and
force
Snape
mark
but
saw
his
horror
that
the
rest
the
contents
had
vanished
sorry
said
Hermione
with
her
hands
over
her
mouth
really
sorry
Harry
thought
you
finished
cleared
Harry
could
not
bring
himself
answer
When
the
bell
rang
hurried
out
the
dungeon
without
backwards
glance
and
made
sure
that
found
himself
seat
between
Neville
and
Seamus
for
lunch
that
Hermione
could
not
start
nagging
him
again
about
using
Umbridge
office
was
such
bad
mood
the
time
got
Divination
that
had
quite
forgotten
his
careers
appointment
with
Professor
McGonagall
remembering
only
when
Ron
asked
him
why
wasn
her
office
hurtled
back
upstairs
and
arrived
out
breath
only
few
minutes
late
Sorry
Professor
panted
closed
the
door
forgot
matter
Potter
she
said
briskly
but
she
spoke
somebody
else
sniffed
from
the
corner
Harry
looked
round
Professor
Umbridge
was
sitting
there
clipboard
her
knee
fussy
little
pie
frill
around
her
neck
and
small
horribly
smug
smile
her
face
Sit
down
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
tersely
Her
hands
shook
slightly
she
shuffled
the
many
pamphlets
littering
her
desk
Harry
sat
down
with
his
back
Umbridge
and
did
his
best
pretend
could
not
hear
the
scratching
her
quill
her
clipboard
Well
Potter
this
meeting
talk
over
any
career
ideas
you
might
have
and
help
you
decide
which
subjects
you
should
continue
into
the
sixth
and
seventh
years
said
Professor
McGonagall
Have
you
had
any
thoughts
about
what
you
would
like
after
you
leave
Hogwarts
said
Harry
was
finding
the
scratching
noise
from
behind
him
very
distracting
Yes
Professor
McGonagall
prompted
Harry
Well
thought
maybe
being
Auror
Harry
mumbled
You
need
top
grades
for
that
said
Professor
McGonagall
extracting
small
dark
leaflet
from
under
the
mass
her
desk
and
opening
They
ask
for
minimum
five
and
nothing
under
Exceeds
Expectations
grade
see
Then
you
would
required
undergo
stringent
series
character
and
aptitude
tests
the
Auror
office
difficult
career
path
Potter
they
only
take
the
best
fact
don
think
anybody
has
been
taken
the
last
three
years
this
moment
Professor
Umbridge
gave
very
tiny
cough
though
she
was
trying
see
how
quietly
she
could
Professor
McGonagall
ignored
her
You
want
know
which
subjects
you
ought
take
suppose
she
went
talking
little
louder
than
before
Yes
said
Harry
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
suppose
Naturally
said
Professor
McGonagall
crisply
would
also
advise
Professor
Umbridge
gave
another
cough
little
more
audible
this
time
Professor
McGonagall
closed
her
eyes
for
moment
opened
them
again
and
continued
though
nothing
had
happened
would
also
advise
Transfiguration
because
Aurors
frequently
need
Transfigure
Untransfigure
their
work
And
ought
tell
you
now
Potter
that
not
accept
students
into
classes
unless
they
have
achieved
Exceeds
Expectations
higher
Ordinary
Wizarding
Level
say
you
averaging
Acceptable
the
moment
you
need
put
some
good
hard
work
before
the
exams
stand
chance
continuing
Then
you
ought
Charms
always
useful
and
Potions
Yes
Potter
Potions
she
added
with
the
merest
flicker
smile
Poisonsand
antidotes
are
essential
study
for
Aurors
And
must
tell
you
that
Professor
Snape
absolutely
refuses
take
students
who
get
anything
other
than
Outstanding
their
Professor
Umbridge
gave
her
most
pronounced
cough
yet
May
offer
you
cough
drop
Dolores
Professor
McGonagall
asked
curtly
without
looking
Professor
Umbridge
thank
you
very
much
said
Umbridge
with
that
simpering
laugh
Harry
hated
much
just
wondered
whether
could
make
the
teensiest
interruption
Minerva
daresay
you
find
you
can
said
Professor
McGonagall
through
tightly
gritted
teeth
was
just
wondering
whether
Potter
hasquite
the
temperament
for
Auror
said
Professor
Umbridge
sweetly
Were
you
said
Professor
McGonagall
haughtily
Well
Potter
she
continued
though
there
had
been
interruption
you
are
serious
this
ambition
would
advise
you
concentrate
hard
bringing
your
Transfiguration
and
Potions
scratch
see
Professor
Flitwick
has
graded
you
between
Acceptable
and
Exceeds
Expectations
for
the
last
two
years
your
Charmwork
seems
satisfactory
for
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
your
marks
have
been
generally
high
Professor
Lupin
particular
thought
you
are
you
quite
sure
you
wouldn
like
cough
drop
Dolores
need
thank
you
Minerva
simpered
Professor
Umbridge
who
had
just
coughed
her
loudest
yet
was
just
concerned
that
you
might
not
have
Harry
most
recent
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
marks
front
you
quite
sure
slipped
note
What
this
thing
said
Professor
McGonagall
tone
revulsion
she
pulled
sheet
pink
parchment
from
between
the
leaves
Harry
folder
She
glanced
down
her
eyebrows
slightly
raised
then
placed
back
into
the
folder
without
comment
Yes
was
saying
Potter
Professor
Lupin
thought
you
showed
pronounced
aptitude
for
the
subject
and
obviously
for
Auror
Did
you
not
understand
note
Minerva
asked
Professor
Umbridge
honeyed
tones
quite
forgetting
cough
course
understood
said
Professor
McGonagall
her
teeth
clenched
tightly
the
words
came
out
little
muffled
Well
then
confused
afraid
don
quite
understand
how
you
can
give
Potter
false
hope
that
False
hope
repeated
Professor
McGonagall
still
refusing
look
round
Professor
Umbridge
has
achieved
high
marks
all
his
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
tests
terribly
sorry
have
contradict
you
Minerva
but
you
will
see
from
note
Harry
has
been
achieving
very
poor
results
his
classes
with
should
have
made
meaning
plainer
said
Professor
McGonagall
turning
last
look
Umbridge
directly
the
eyes
has
achieved
high
marks
all
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
tests
set
competent
teacher
Professor
Umbridge
smile
vanished
suddenly
light
bulb
blowing
She
sat
back
her
chair
turned
sheet
her
clipboard
and
began
scribbling
very
fast
indeed
her
bulging
eyes
rolling
from
side
side
Professor
McGonagall
turned
back
Harry
her
thin
nostrils
flared
her
eyes
burning
Any
questions
Potter
Yes
said
Harry
What
sort
character
and
aptitude
tests
the
Ministry
you
you
get
enough
Well
you
need
demonstrate
the
ability
react
well
pressure
and
forth
said
Professor
McGonagall
perseverance
and
dedication
because
Auror
training
takes
further
three
years
not
mention
very
high
skills
practical
Defence
will
mean
lot
more
study
even
after
you
left
school
unless
you
prepared
think
you
also
find
said
Umbridge
her
voice
very
cold
now
that
the
Ministry
looks
into
the
records
those
applying
Aurors
Their
criminal
records
unless
you
prepared
take
even
more
exams
after
Hogwarts
you
should
really
look
another
Which
means
that
this
boy
has
much
chance
becoming
Auror
Dumbledore
has
ever
returning
this
school
very
good
chance
then
said
Professor
McGonagall
Potter
has
criminal
record
said
Umbridge
loudly
Potter
has
been
cleared
all
charges
said
McGonagall
even
more
loudly
Professor
Umbridge
stood
She
was
short
that
this
did
not
make
great
deal
difference
but
her
fussy
simpering
demeanour
had
given
place
hard
fury
that
made
her
broad
flabby
face
look
oddly
sinister
Potter
has
chance
whatsoever
becoming
Auror
Professor
McGonagall
got
her
feet
too
and
her
case
this
was
much
more
impressive
move
she
towered
over
Professor
Umbridge
Potter
she
said
ringing
tones
will
assist
you
become
Auror
the
last
thing
have
coach
you
nightly
will
make
sure
you
achieve
the
required
results
The
Minister
for
Magic
will
never
employ
Harry
Potter
said
Umbridge
her
voice
rising
furiously
There
may
well
new
Minister
for
Magic
the
time
Potter
ready
join
shouted
Professor
McGonagall
Aha
shrieked
Professor
Umbridge
pointing
stubby
finger
McGonagall
Yes
Yes
yes
yes
course
That
what
you
want
isn
Minerva
McGonagall
You
want
Cornelius
Fudge
replaced
Albus
Dumbledore
You
think
you
where
don
you
Senior
Undersecretary
the
Minister
and
Headmistress
boot
You
are
raving
said
Professor
McGonagall
superbly
disdainful
Potter
that
concludes
our
careers
consultation
Harry
swung
his
bag
over
his
shoulder
and
hurried
out
the
room
not
daring
look
Professor
Umbridge
could
hear
her
and
Professor
McGonagall
continuing
shout
each
other
all
the
way
back
along
the
corridor
Professor
Umbridge
was
still
breathing
though
she
had
just
run
race
when
she
strode
into
their
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
that
afternoon
hope
you
thought
better
what
you
were
planning
Harry
Hermione
whispered
the
moment
they
had
opened
their
books
Chapter
Thirty
four
Non
Retaliation
and
Negotiation
Umbridge
looks
like
she
really
bad
mood
already
Every
now
and
then
Umbridge
shot
glowering
looks
Harry
who
kept
his
head
down
staring
atDefensive
Magical
Theory
his
eyes
unfocused
thinking
could
just
imagine
Professor
McGonagall
reaction
was
caught
trespassing
Professor
Umbridge
office
mere
hours
after
she
had
vouched
for
him
there
was
nothing
stop
him
simply
going
back
Gryffindor
Tower
and
hoping
that
some
time
during
the
next
summer
holidays
would
have
chance
ask
Sirius
about
the
scene
had
witnessed
the
Pensieve
nothing
except
that
the
thought
taking
this
sensible
course
action
made
him
feel
though
lead
weight
had
dropped
into
his
stomach
and
then
there
was
the
matter
Fred
and
George
whose
diversion
was
already
planned
not
mention
the
knife
Sirius
had
given
him
which
was
currently
residing
his
schoolbag
along
with
his
father
old
Invisibility
Cloak
But
the
fact
remained
that
was
caught
Dumbledore
sacrificed
himself
keep
you
school
Harry
whispered
Hermione
raising
her
book
hide
her
face
from
Umbridge
And
you
get
thrown
out
today
will
all
have
been
for
nothing
could
abandon
the
plan
and
simply
learn
live
with
the
memory
what
his
father
had
done
summer
day
more
than
twenty
years
ago
And
then
remembered
Sirius
the
fire
upstairs
the
Gryffindor
common
room
You
less
like
your
father
than
thought
the
risk
would
been
what
made
fun
for
James
But
did
want
like
his
father
any
more
Harry
don
please
don
Hermione
said
anguished
tones
the
bell
rang
the
end
the
class
did
not
answer
did
not
know
what
Ron
seemed
determined
give
neither
his
opinion
nor
his
advice
would
not
look
Harry
though
when
Hermione
opened
her
mouth
try
dissuading
Harry
some
more
said
low
voice
Give
rest
can
make
his
own
mind
Harry
heart
beat
very
fast
left
the
classroom
was
halfway
along
the
corridor
outside
when
heard
the
unmistakeable
sounds
diversion
going
off
the
distance
There
were
screams
and
yells
reverberating
from
somewhere
above
them
people
exiting
the
classrooms
all
around
Harry
were
stopping
their
tracks
and
looking
the
ceiling
fearfully
Umbridge
came
pelting
out
her
classroom
fast
her
short
legs
would
carry
her
Pulling
out
her
wand
she
hurried
off
the
opposite
direction
was
now
never
Harry
please
Hermione
pleaded
weakly
But
had
made
his
mind
hitching
his
bag
more
securely
his
shoulder
set
off
run
weaving
and
out
students
now
hurrying
the
opposite
direction
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
the
east
wing
Harry
reached
the
corridor
Umbridge
office
and
found
deserted
Dashing
behind
large
suit
armour
whose
helmet
creaked
around
watch
him
pulled
open
his
bag
seized
Siriuss
knife
and
donned
the
Invisibility
Cloak
then
crept
slowly
and
carefully
back
out
from
behind
the
suit
armour
and
along
the
corridor
until
reached
Umbridge
door
inserted
the
blade
the
magical
knife
into
the
crack
around
and
moved
gently
and
down
then
withdrew
There
was
tiny
click
and
the
door
swung
open
ducked
inside
the
office
closed
the
door
quickly
behind
him
and
looked
around
Nothing
was
moving
except
the
horrible
kittens
that
were
still
frolicking
the
wall
plates
above
the
confiscated
broomsticks
Harry
pulled
off
his
Cloak
and
striding
over
the
fireplace
found
what
was
looking
for
within
seconds
small
box
containing
glittering
Floo
powder
crouched
down
front
the
empty
grate
his
hands
shaking
had
never
done
this
before
though
thought
knew
how
must
work
Sticking
his
head
into
the
fireplace
took
large
pinch
powder
and
dropped
the
logs
stacked
neatly
beneath
him
They
exploded
once
into
emerald
green
flames
Number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
Harry
said
loudly
and
clearly
was
one
the
most
curious
sensations
had
ever
experienced
had
travelled
Floo
powder
before
course
but
then
had
been
his
entire
body
that
had
spun
around
and
around
the
flames
through
the
network
wizarding
fireplaces
that
stretched
over
the
country
This
time
his
knees
remained
firm
upon
the
cold
floor
Umbridge
office
and
only
his
head
hurtled
through
the
emerald
fire
And
then
abruptly
had
begun
the
spinning
stopped
Feeling
rather
sick
and
though
were
wearing
exceptionally
hot
muffler
around
his
head
Harry
opened
his
eyes
find
that
was
looking
out
the
kitchen
fireplace
the
long
wooden
table
where
man
sat
poring
over
piece
parchment
Sirius
The
man
jumped
and
looked
around
was
not
Sirius
but
Lupin
Harry
said
looking
thoroughly
shocked
What
are
you
what
happened
everything
all
right
Yeah
said
Harry
just
wondered
mean
just
fancied
chat
with
Sirius
call
him
said
Lupin
getting
his
feet
still
looking
perplexed
went
upstairs
look
for
Kreacher
seems
hiding
the
attic
again
And
Harry
saw
Lupin
hurry
out
the
kitchen
Now
was
left
with
nothing
look
but
the
chair
and
table
legs
wondered
why
Sirius
had
never
mentioned
how
very
uncomfortable
was
speak
out
the
fire
his
knees
were
already
objecting
painfully
their
prolonged
contact
with
Umbridge
hard
stone
floor
Lupin
returned
with
Sirius
his
heels
moments
later
What
said
Sirius
urgently
sweeping
his
long
dark
hair
out
his
eyes
and
dropping
the
ground
front
the
fire
that
and
Harry
were
level
Lupin
knelt
down
too
looking
very
concerned
Are
you
all
right
you
need
help
said
Harry
nothing
like
that
just
wanted
talk
about
dad
They
exchanged
look
great
surprise
but
Harry
did
not
have
time
feel
awkward
embarrassed
his
knees
were
becoming
sorer
the
second
and
guessed
five
minutes
had
already
passed
from
the
start
the
diversion
George
had
only
guaranteed
him
twenty
therefore
plunged
immediately
into
the
story
what
had
seen
the
Pensieve
When
had
finished
neither
Sirius
nor
Lupin
spoke
for
moment
Then
Lupin
said
quietly
wouldn
like
you
judge
your
father
what
you
saw
there
Harry
was
only
fifteen
fifteen
said
Harry
heatedly
Look
Harry
said
Sirius
placatingly
James
and
Snape
hated
each
other
from
the
moment
they
set
eyes
each
other
was
just
one
those
things
you
can
understand
that
can
you
think
James
was
everything
Snape
wanted
was
popular
was
good
Quidditch
good
pretty
much
everything
And
Snape
was
just
this
little
oddball
who
was
his
eyes
the
Dark
Arts
and
James
whatever
else
may
have
appeared
you
Harry
always
hated
the
Dark
Arts
Yeah
said
Harry
but
just
attacked
Snape
for
good
reason
just
because
well
just
because
you
said
you
were
bored
finished
with
slightly
apologetic
note
his
voice
not
proud
said
Sirius
quickly
Lupin
looked
sideways
Sirius
then
said
Look
Harry
what
you
got
understand
that
your
father
and
Sirius
were
the
best
the
school
whatever
they
did
everyone
thought
they
were
the
height
cool
they
sometimes
got
bit
carried
away
were
sometimes
arrogant
little
berks
you
mean
said
Sirius
Lupin
smiled
kept
messing
his
hair
said
Harry
pained
voice
Sirius
and
Lupin
laughed
forgotten
used
that
said
Sirius
affectionately
Was
playing
with
the
Snitch
said
Lupin
eagerly
Yeah
said
Harry
watching
uncomprehendingly
Sirius
and
Lupin
beamed
reminiscently
Well
thought
was
bit
idiot
course
wasa
bit
idiot
said
Sirius
bracingly
were
all
idiots
Well
not
Moony
much
said
fairly
looking
Lupin
But
Lupin
shook
his
head
Did
ever
tell
you
lay
off
Snape
said
Did
ever
have
the
guts
tell
you
thought
you
were
out
order
Yeah
well
said
Sirius
you
made
feel
ashamed
ourselves
sometimes
that
was
something
And
said
Harry
doggedly
determined
say
everything
that
was
his
mind
now
was
here
kept
looking
over
the
girls
the
lake
hoping
they
were
watching
him
well
always
made
fool
himself
whenever
Lily
was
around
said
Sirius
shrugging
couldn
stop
himself
showing
off
whenever
got
near
her
How
come
she
married
him
Harry
asked
miserably
She
hated
him
Nah
she
didn
said
Sirius
She
started
going
out
with
him
seventh
year
said
Lupin
Once
James
had
deflated
his
head
bit
said
Sirius
And
stopped
hexing
people
just
for
the
fun
said
Lupin
Even
Snape
said
Harry
Well
said
Lupin
slowly
Snape
was
special
case
mean
never
lost
opportunity
curse
James
you
couldn
really
expect
James
take
that
lying
down
could
you
And
mum
was
with
that
She
didn
know
too
much
about
tell
you
the
truth
said
Sirius
mean
James
didn
take
Snape
dates
with
her
and
jinx
him
front
her
did
Sirius
frowned
Harry
who
was
still
looking
unconvinced
Look
said
your
father
was
the
best
friend
ever
had
and
was
good
person
lot
people
are
idiots
the
age
fifteen
grew
out
Yeah
said
Harry
heavily
just
never
thought
feel
sorry
for
Snape
Now
you
mention
said
Lupin
faint
crease
between
his
eyebrows
how
did
Snape
react
when
found
you
seen
all
this
told
never
teach
Occlumency
again
said
Harry
indifferently
like
that
big
disappoint
WHAT
shouted
Sirius
causing
Harry
jump
and
inhale
mouthful
ashes
Are
you
serious
Harry
said
Lupin
quickly
stopped
giving
you
lessons
Yeah
said
Harry
surprised
what
considered
great
over
reaction
But
don
care
bit
relief
tell
you
the
coming
there
have
word
with
Snape
said
Sirius
forcefully
and
actually
made
stand
but
Lupin
wrenched
him
back
down
again
anyone
going
tell
Snape
will
said
firmly
But
Harry
first
all
you
back
Snape
and
tell
him
that
account
stop
giving
you
lessons
when
Dumbledore
hears
can
tell
him
that

said
Harry
outraged
You
didn
see
him
when
got
out
the
Pensieve
Harry
there
nothing
important
you
learning
Occlumency
said
Lupin
sternly
you
understand
Nothing
said
Harry
thoroughly
discomposed
not
mention
annoyed
try
and
say
something
him
but
won
fell
silent
could
hear
distant
footsteps
that
Kreacher
coming
downstairs
said
Sirius
glancing
behind
him
must
somebody
your
end
Harry
heart
skipped
several
beats
better
said
hastily
and
pulled
his
head
backwards
out
the
Grimmauld
Place
fire
For
moment
his
head
seemed
revolving
his
shoulders
then
found
himself
kneeling
front
Umbridge
fire
with
firmly
back
and
watching
the
emerald
flames
flicker
and
die
Quickly
quickly
heard
wheezy
voice
mutter
right
outside
the
office
door
she
left
open
Harry
dived
for
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
had
just
managed
pull
back
over
himself
when
Filch
burst
into
the
office
looked
absolutely
delighted
about
something
and
was
talking
himself
feverishly
crossed
the
room
pulled
open
drawer
Umbridge
desk
and
began
rifling
through
the
papers
inside
Approval
for
Whipping
Approval
for
Whipping
can
last
they
had
coming
them
for
years
pulled
out
piece
parchment
kissed
then
shuffled
rapidly
back
out
the
door
clutching
his
chest
Harry
leapt
his
feet
and
making
sure
had
his
bag
and
that
the
Invisibility
Cloak
was
completely
covering
him
wrenched
open
the
door
and
hurried
out
the
office
after
Filch
who
was
hobbling
along
faster
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
him
One
landing
down
from
Umbridge
office
Harry
thought
was
safe
become
visible
again
pulled
off
the
Cloak
shoved
his
bag
and
hurried
onwards
There
was
great
deal
shouting
and
movement
coming
from
the
Entrance
Hall
ran
down
the
marble
staircase
and
found
what
looked
like
most
the
school
assembled
there
was
just
like
the
night
when
Trelawney
had
been
sacked
Students
were
standing
all
around
the
walls
great
ring
some
them
Harry
noticed
covered
substance
that
looked
very
like
Stinksap
teachers
and
ghosts
were
also
the
crowd
Prominent
among
the
onlookers
were
members
the
Inquisitorial
Squad
who
were
all
looking
exceptionally
pleased
with
themselves
and
Peeves
who
was
bobbing
overhead
gazed
down
Fred
and
George
who
stood
the
middle
the
floor
with
the
unmistakeable
look
two
people
who
had
just
been
cornered
said
Umbridge
triumphantly
Harry
realised
she
was
standing
just
few
stairs
front
him
once
more
looking
down
upon
her
prey
you
think
amusing
turn
school
corridor
into
swamp
you
Pretty
amusing
yeah
said
Fred
looking
her
without
the
slightest
sign
fear
Filch
elbowed
his
way
closer
Umbridge
almost
crying
with
happiness
got
the
form
Headmistress
said
hoarsely
waving
the
piece
parchment
Harry
had
just
seen
him
take
from
her
desk
got
the
form
and
got
the
whips
waiting
let
now
Very
good
Argus
she
said
You
two
she
went
gazing
down
Fred
and
George
are
about
learn
what
happens
wrongdoers
school
You
know
what
said
Fred
don
think
are
turned
his
twin
George
said
Fred
think
outgrown
full
time
education
Yeah
been
feeling
that
way
myself
said
George
lightly
Time
test
our
talents
the
real
world
you
reckon
asked
Fred
Definitely
said
George
And
before
Umbridge
could
say
word
they
raised
their
wands
and
said
together
Accio
brooms
Harry
heard
loud
crash
somewhere
the
distance
Looking
his
left
ducked
just
time
Fred
and
George
broomsticks
one
still
trailing
the
heavy
chain
and
iron
peg
with
which
Umbridge
had
fastened
them
the
wall
were
hurtling
along
the
corridor
towards
their
owners
they
turned
left
streaked
down
the
stairs
and
stopped
sharply
front
the
twins
the
chain
clattering
loudly
the
flagged
stone
floor
won
seeing
you
Fred
told
Professor
Umbridge
swinging
his
leg
over
his
broomstick
Yeah
don
bother
keep
touch
said
George
mounting
his
own
Fred
looked
around
the
assembled
students
the
silent
watchful
crowd
anyone
fancies
buying
Portable
Swamp
demonstrated
upstairs
come
number
ninety
three
Diagon
Alley
Weasleys
Wizarding
Wheezes
said
loud
voice
Our

premises
Special

students
who
swear
they
going
use
our
products
get
rid
this
old
bat
added
George
pointing
Professor
Umbridge
STOP
THEM
shrieked
Umbridge
but
was
too
late
the
Inquisitorial
Squad
closed
Fred
and
George
kicked
off
from
the
floor
shooting
fifteen
feet
into
the
air
the
iron
peg
swinging
dangerously
below
Fred
looked
across
the
hall
the
poltergeist
bobbing
his
level
above
the
crowd
Give
her
hell
from
Peeves
And
Peeves
who
Harry
had
never
seen
take
order
from
student
before
swept
his
belled
hat
from
his
head
and
sprang
salute
Fred
and
George
wheeled
about
tumultuous
applause
from
the
students
below
and
sped
out
the
open
front
doors
into
the
glorious
sunset
GRAWP
The
story
Fred
and
George
flight
freedom
was
retold
often
over
the
next
few
days
that
Harry
could
tell
would
soon
become
the
stuff
Hogwarts
legend
within
week
even
those
who
had
been
eye
witnesses
were
half
convinced
they
had
seen
the
twins
dive
bomb
Umbridge
their
brooms
and
pelt
her
with
Dungbombs
before
zooming
out
the
doors
the
immediate
aftermath
their
departure
there
was
great
wave
talk
about
copying
them
Harry
frequently
heard
students
saying
things
like
Honestly
some
days
just
feel
like
jumping
broom
and
leaving
this
place
else
One
more
lesson
likethat
and
might
just
Weasley
Fred
and
George
had
made
sure
nobody
was
likely
forget
them
too
soon
For
one
thing
they
had
not
left
instructions
how
remove
the
swamp
that
now
filled
the
corridor
the
fifth
floor
the
east
wing
Umbridge
and
Filch
had
been
observed
trying
different
means
removing
but
without
success
Eventually
the
area
was
roped
off
and
Filch
gnashing
his
teeth
furiously
was
given
the
task
punting
students
across
their
classrooms
Harry
was
certain
that
teachers
like
McGonagall
Flitwick
could
have
removed
the
swamp
instant
but
just
the
case
Fred
and
Georges
Wildfire
Whiz
bangs
they
seemed
prefer
watch
Umbridge
struggle
Then
there
were
the
two
large
broom
shaped
holes
Umbridge
office
door
through
which
Fred
and
George
Cleansweeps
had
smashed
rejoin
their
masters
Filch
fitted
new
door
and
removed
Harry
Firebolt
the
dungeons
where
was
rumoured
Umbridge
had
set
armed
security
troll
guard
However
her
troubles
were
far
from
over
Inspired
Fred
and
George
example
great
number
students
were
now
vying
for
the
newly
vacant
positions
Troublemakers
Chief
spite
the
new
door
somebody
managed
slip
hairy
snouted
Niffler
into
Umbridge
office
which
promptly
tore
the
place
apart
its
search
for
shiny
objects
leapt
Umbridge
when
she
entered
and
tried
gnaw
the
rings
off
her
stubby
fingers
Dungbombs
and
Stink
Pellets
were
dropped
frequently
the
corridors
that
became
the
new
fashion
for
students
perform
Bubble
Head
Charms
themselves
before
leaving
lessons
which
ensured
them
supply
fresh
air
even
though
gave
them
all
the
peculiar
appearance
wearing
upside
down
goldfish
bowls
their
heads
Filch
prowled
the
corridors
with
horsewhip
ready
his
hands
desperate
catch
miscreants
but
the
problem
was
that
there
were
now
many
them
never
knew
which
way
turn
The
Inquisitorial
Squad
was
attempting
help
him
but
odd
things

Hermione
delight
missed
all
her
lessons
the
following
day
she
had
sprouted
antlers
Meanwhile
became
clear
just
how
many
Skiving
Snackboxes
Fred
and
George
had
managed
sell
before
leaving
Hogwarts
Umbridge
only
had
enter
her
classroom
for
the
students
assembled
there
faint
vomit
develop
dangerous
fevers
else
spout
blood
from
both
nostrils
Shrieking
with
rage
and
frustration
she
attempted
trace
the
mysterious
symptoms
their
source
but
the
students
told
her
stubbornly
they
were
suffering
from
Umbridge
itis
After
putting
four
successive
classes
detention
and
failing
discover
their
secret
she
was
forced
give
and
allow
the
bleeding
swooning
sweating
and
vomiting
students
leave
her
classes
droves
But
not
even
the
users
the
Snackboxes
could
compete
with
that
master
chaos
Peeves
who
seemed
have
taken
Fred
parting
words
deeply
heart
Cackling
madly
soared
through
the
school
upending
tables
bursting
out
blackboards
toppling
statues
and
vases
twice
shut
Mrs
Norris
inside
suit
armour
from
which
she
was
rescued
yowling
loudly
the
furious
caretaker
Peeves
smashed
lanterns
and
snuffed
out
candles
juggled

torches
over
the

screaming
students

dropped

tarantulas
the
middle
the
Great
Hall
during
breakfast
and
whenever
fancied
break
spent
hours
time
floating
along
after
Umbridge
and
blowing
loud
raspberries
every
time
she
spoke
None
the
staff
but
Filch
seemed
stirring
themselves
help
her
Indeed
week
after
Fred
and
George
departure
Harry
witnessed
Professor
McGonagall
walking
right
past
Peeves
who
was
determinedly
loosening
crystal
chandelier
and
could
have
sworn
heard
her
tell
the
poltergeist
out
the
corner
her
mouth
unscrews
the
other
way
cap
matters
Montague
had
still
not
recovered
from
his
sojourn
the
toilet
remained
confused
and
disorientated
and
his
parents
were
observed
one
Tuesday
morning
striding
the
front
drive
looking
extremely
angry
Should
say
something
said
Hermione
worried
voice
pressing
her
cheek
against
the
Charms
window
that
she
could
see
and
Mrs
Montague
marching
inside
About
what
happened
him
case
helps
Madam
Pomfrey
cure
him
Course
not
recover
said
Ron
indifferently
Anyway
more
trouble
for
Umbridge
isn
said
Harry
satisfied
voice
and
Ron
both
tapped
the
teacups
they
were
supposed
charming
with
their
wands
Harry
spouted
four
very
short
legs
that
could
not
reach
the
desk
and
wriggled
pointlessly
midair
Ron
grew
four
very
thin
spindly
legs
that
hoisted
the
cup
off
the
desk
with
great
difficulty
trembled
for
few
seconds
then
folded
causing
the
cup
crack
into
two
Reparo
said
Hermione
quickly
mending
Ron
cup
with
wave
her
wand
That
all
very
well
but
what
Montague
permanently
injured
Who
cares
said
Ron
irritably
while
his
teacup
stood
drunkenly
again
trembling
violently
the
knees
Montague
shouldn
have
tried
take
all
those
points
from
Gryffindor
should
you
want
worry
about
anyone
Hermione
worry
about
You
she
said
catching
her
teacup
scampered
happily
away
across
the
desk
four
sturdy
little
willow
patterned
legs
and
replacing
front
her
Why
should
worried
about
you
When
Mum
next
letter
finally
gets
through
Umbridge
screening
process
said
Ron
bitterly
now
holding
his
cup
while
its
frail
legs
tried
feebly
support
its
weight
going
deep
trouble
wouldn
surprised
she
sent
another
Howler
But
fault
Fred
and
George
left
you
wait
said
Ron
darkly
She
say
should
stopped
them
leaving
should
grabbed
the
ends
their
brooms
and
hung
something
yeah
all
fault
Well
she
does
say
that
very
unfair
you
couldn
have
done
anything
But
sure
she
won
mean
really
true
they
got
premises
Diagon
Alley
they
must
have
been
planning
this
for
ages
Yeah
but
that
another
thing
how
did
they
get
premises
said
Ron
hitting
his
teacup
hard
with
his
wand
that
its
legs
collapsed
again
and
lay
twitching
before
him
bit
dodgy
isn
They
need
loads
Galleons
afford
the
rent
place
Diagon
Alley
She
want
know
what
they
been
get
their
hands
that
sort
gold
Well
yes
that
occurred
too
said
Hermione
allowing
her
teacup
jog
neat
little
circles
around
Harry
whose
stubby
little
legs
were
still
unable
touch
the
desktop
been
wondering
whether
Mundungus
has
persuaded
them
sell
stolen
goods
something
awful
hasn
said
Harry
curtly
How
you
know
said
Ron
and
Hermione
together
Because
Harry
hesitated
but
the
moment
confess
finally
seemed
have
come
There
was
good
gained
keeping
silent
meant
anyone
suspected
that
Fred
and
George
were
criminals
Because
they
got
the
gold
from
gave
them
Triwizard
winnings
last
June
There
was
shocked
silence
then
Hermione
teacup
jogged
right
over
the
edge
the
desk
and
smashed
the
floor
Harry
you
didn
she
said
Yes
did
said
Harry
mutinously
And
don
regret
either
didn
need
the
gold
and
they
great
running
joke
shop
But
this
excellent
said
Ron
looking
thrilled
all
your
fault
Harry
Mum
can
blame
all
Can
tell
her
Yeah
suppose
you
better
said
Harry
dully
specially
she
thinks
they
receiving
stolen
cauldrons
something
Hermione
said
nothing
all
for
the
rest
the
lesson
but
Harry
had
shrewd
suspicion
that
her
self
restraint
was
bound
crack
before
long
Sure
enough
once
they
had
left
the
castle
for
break
and
were
standing
around
the
weak
May
sunshine
she
fixed
Harry
with
beady
eye
and
opened
her
mouth
with
determined
air
Harry
interrupted
her
before
she
had
even
started
good
nagging
done
said
firmly
Fred
and
George
have
got
the
gold
spent
good
bit
too
the
sounds
and
can
get
back
from
them
and
don
want
save
your
breath
Hermione
wasn
going
say
anything
about
Fred
and
George
she
said
injured
voice
Ron
snorted
disbelievingly
and
Hermione
threw
him
very
dirty
look
wasn
she
said
angrily
matter
fact
was
going
ask
Harry
when
going
back
Snape
and
ask
for
more
Occlumency
lessons
Harry
heart
sank
Once
they
had
exhausted
the
subject
Fred
and
George
dramatic
departure
which
admittedly
had
taken
many
hours
Ron
and
Hermione
had
wanted
hear
news
Sirius
Harry
had
not
confided
them
the
reason
had
wanted
talk
Sirius
the
first
place
had
been
hard
think
what
tell
them
had
ended
saying
truthfully
that
Sirius
wanted
Harry
resume
Occlumency
lessons
had
been
regretting
this
ever
since
Hermione
would
not
let
the
subject
drop
and
kept
reverting
when
Harry
least
expected
You
can
tell
you
stopped
having
funny
dreams
Hermione
said
now
because
Ron
told
you
were
muttering
your
sleep
again
last
night
Harry
threw
Ron
furious
look
Ron
had
the
grace
look
ashamed
himself
You
were
only
muttering
bit
mumbled
apologetically
Something
about
just
bit
further
dreamed
was
watching
you
lot
play
Quidditch
Harry
lied
brutally
was
trying
get
you
stretch
out
bit
further
grab
the
Quaffle
Ron
ears
went
red
Harry
felt
kind
vindictive
pleasure
had
not
course
dreamed
anything
the
sort
Last
night
had
once
again
made
the
journey
along
the
Department
Mysteries
corridor
had
passed
through
the
circular
room
then
the
room
full
clicking
and
dancing
light
until
found
himself
again
inside
that
cavernous
room
full
shelves
which
were
ranged
dusty
glass
spheres
had
hurried
straight
towards
row
number
ninety
seven
turned
left
and
run
along
had
probably
been
then
that
had
spoken
aloud
just
abit
further
for
felt
his
conscious
self
struggling
wake
and
before
had
reached
the
end
the
row
had
found
himself
lying
bed
again
gazing
the
canopy
his
four
poster
You
aretrying
block
your
mind
aren
you
said
Hermione
looking
beadily
Harry
You
are
keeping
going
with
your
Occlumency
course
said
Harry
trying
sound
though
this
question
was
insulting
but
not
quite
meeting
her
eye
The
truth
was
was
intensely
curious
about
what
was
hidden
that
room
full
dusty
orbs
that
was
quite
keen
for
the
dreams
continue
The
problem
was
that
with
just
under
month
until
the
exams
and
every
free
moment
devoted
revision
his
mind
seemed
saturated
with
information
when
went
bed
found
very
difficult
get
sleep
all
and
when
did
his
overwrought
brain
presented
him
most
nights
with
stupid
dreams
about
the
exams
also
suspected
that
part
his
mind
the
part
that
often
spoke
Hermione
voice
now
felt
guilty
the
occasions
strayed
down
that
corridor
ending
the
black
door
and
sought
wake
him
before
could
reach
the
journeys
end
You
know
said
Ron
whose
ears
were
still
flaming
red
Montague
doesn
recover
before
Slytherin
play
Hufflepuff
might
with
chance
winning
the
Cup
Yeah

said
Harry
glad

Slytherin

Saturday
Yeah
that
right
said
Harry
losing
track
what
was
agreeing
Cho
Chang
had
just
walked
across
the
courtyard
determinedly
not
looking
him
The
final
match
the
Quidditch
season
Gryffindor
versus
Ravenclaw
was
take
place
the
last
weekend
May
Although
Slytherin
had
been
narrowly
defeated
Hufflepuff
their
last
match
Gryffindor
were
not
daring
hope
for
victory
due
mainly
though
course
nobody
said
him
Ron
abysmal
goal
keeping
record
however
seemed
have
found
new
optimism
mean
can
get
any
worse
can
told
Harry
and
Hermione
grimly
over
breakfast
the
morning
the
match
Nothing
lose
now
there
You
know
said
Hermione
she
and
Harry
walked
down
the
pitch
little
later
the
midst
very
excitable
crowd
think
Ron
might
better
without
Fred
and
George
around
They
never
exactly
gave
him
lot
confidence
Luna
Lovegood
overtook
them
with
what
appeared
live
eagle
perched
top
her
head
gosh
forgot
said
Hermione
watching
the
eagle
flapping
its
wings
Luna
walked
serenely
past
group
cackling
and
pointing
Slytherins
Cho
will
playing
won
she
Harry
who
had
not
forgotten
this
merely
grunted
They
found
seats
the
topmost
row
the
stands
was
fine
clear
day
Ron
could
not
wish
for
better
and
Harry
found
himself
hoping
against
hope
that
Ron
would
not
give
the
Slytherins
cause
for
more
rousing
choruses
Weasley
our
King
Lee
Jordan
who
had
been
very
dispirited
since
Fred
and
George
had
left
was
commentating
usual
the
teams
zoomed
out
the
pitch
named
the
players
with
something
less
than
his
usual
gusto
Bradley
Davies
Chang
said
and
Harry
felt
his
stomach
perform
less
back
flip
more
feeble
lurch
Cho
walked
out
the
pitch
her
shiny
black
hair
rippling
the
slightbreeze
was
not
sure
what
wanted
happen
any
more
except
that
could
not
stand
any
more
rows
Even
the
sight
her
chatting
animatedly
Roger
Davies
they
prepared
mount
their
brooms
caused
him
only
slight
twinge
jealousy
And
they

said
Lee
And
Davies

Quaffle

Lee

very
loudly
And

Harry
and
Hermione
groaned
with
the
rest
the
Gryffindors
Predictably
horribly
the
Slytherins
the
other
side
the
stands
began
sing
Weasley
cannot
save
thingHe
cannot
block
single
ring
Harry
said
hoarse
voice
Harry
ear
Hermione
Harry
looked
round
and
saw
Hagrid
enormous
bearded
face
sticking
between
the
seats
Apparently
had
squeezed
his
way
all
along
the
row
behind
for
the
first
and
second
years
had
just
passed
had
ruffled
flattened
look
about
them
For
some
reason
Hagrid
was
bent
double
though
anxious
not
seen
though
was
still
least
four
feet
taller
than
everybody
else
Listen
whispered

Harry
Till

Hagrid

while
ryone

other

Hagrid
nose
was
gently
dripping
blood
His
eyes
were
both
blackened
Harry
had
not
seen
him
this
close
since
his
return
the
school
looked
utterly
woebegone
Course
said
Harry
once
course
come
and
Hermione
edged
back
along
their
row
seats
causing
much
grumbling
among
the
students
who
had
stand
for
them
The
people
Hagrid
row
were
not
complaining
merely
attempting
make
themselves
small
possible
ppreciate

said
Hagrid
they
reached
the
stairs
kept
looking
around
nervously

the
lawn

Harry

said
Hagrid
pausing
peer
around
the
edge
the
stands
make
sure
the
stretch
lawn
between
there
and
his
cabin
was
deserted
Give
more
time
What
Hagrid
said
Hermione
looking
him
with
concerned
expression
her
face
they
hurried
across
the
grass
towards
the
edge
the
Forest
Yeh
yeh
see
said
Hagrid
looking
over
his
shoulder
great
roar
rose
from
the
stands
behind
them
Hey

someone
jus

Ravenclaw
said
Harry
heavily
Good
good
said
Hagrid
distractedly
Tha
good
They
had
jog
keep
with
him
strode
across
the
lawn
looking
around
with
every
other
step
When
they
reached
his
cabin
Hermione
turned
automatically
left
towards
the
front
door
Hagrid
however
walked
straight
past
into
the
shade
the
trees
the
outermost
edge
the
Forest
where
picked
crossbow
that
was
leaning
against
tree
When
realised
they
were
longer
with
him
turned
goin
here
said
jerking
his
shaggy
head
behind
him
Into
the
Forest
said
Hermione
perplexed
Yeah
said
Hagrid
mon
now
quick
before
spotted
Harry
and
Hermione
looked
each
other
then
ducked
into
the
cover
the
trees
behind
Hagrid
who
was
already
striding
away
from
them
into
the
green
gloom
his
crossbow
over
his
arm
Harry
and
Hermione
ran
catch
with
him
Hagrid
why
are
you
armed
said
Harry
Jus
precaution
said
Hagrid
shrugging
his
massive
shoulders
You
didn
bring
your
crossbow

day
you
showed
the
Thestrals
said
Hermione
timidly
Nah

far
then
said
Hagrid
anyway
tha
was
before
Firenze

the
Forest
wasn
Why

Firenze

asked
Hermione
curiously
Cause

other
centaurs

said
Hagrid
quietly
glancing
around
They
used
ter
well
yeh
couldn
call
friendly
but
got
all
righ
Kept
emselves
emselves
always
turned

Not

sighed
deeply
Firenze
said
they
angry
because

work
for
Dumbledore
Harry
said
tripping
protruding
root
because
was
busy
watching
Hagrid
profile
Yeah
said
Hagrid
heavily
Well

Ruddy
livid
hadn
stepped

kicked
Firenze

They

said
Hermione
sounding
shocked
Yep

Hagrid
gruffly
forcing
his
way
through
severallow
hanging
branches
had
half
the
herd
him
And
you
stopped
said
Harry
amazed
and
impressed
yourself
Course

said
Hagrid
Lucky

really
thought
Firenze
mighta
remembered
tha
before
started
sendin
stupid
warnin
added
hotly
and
unexpectedly
Harry
and
Hermione
looked
each
other
startled
but
Hagrid
scowling
did
not
elaborate
Anyway
said
breathing
little
more
heavily
than
usual
since
then
the
other
centaurs
bin
livid
with
the
trouble
they
got
lot
influence
the
Forest
cleverest
creatures
here
that
why
here
Hagrid
asked
Hermione
The
centaurs
said
Hagrid
shaking
his
head
dismissively
not
them
Well
course
they
could
complicate
the
problem
yeah
but
yeh
see
what
mean
bit
this
incomprehensible
note
fell
silent
and
forged
little
ahead
taking
one
stride
for
every
three
theirs
that
they
had
great
trouble
keeping
with
him
The
path
was
becoming
increasingly
overgrown
and
the
trees
grew
closely
together
they
walked
further
and
further
into
the
Forest
that
was
dark
dusk
They
were
soon
long
way
past
the
clearing
where
Hagrid
had
shown
them
the
Thestrals
but
Harry
felt
sense
unease
until
Hagrid
stepped
unexpectedly
off
the
path
and
began
wending
his
way
and
out
trees
towards
the
dark
heart
the
Forest
Hagrid
said
Harry
fighting
his
way
through
thickly
knotted
brambles
over
which
Hagrid
had
stepped
with
ease
and
remembering
very
vividly
what
had
happened
him
the
other
occasion
had
stepped
off
the
Forest
path
Where
are
going
Bit
further
said
Hagrid
over
his
shoulder
mon
Harry
need
ter
keep
together
now
was
great
struggle
keep
with
Hagrid
what
with
branches
and
thickets
thorn
through
which
Hagrid
marched
easily
they
were
cobwebs
but
which
snagged
Harry
and
Hermione
robes
frequently
entangling
them
severely
that
they
had
stop
for
minutes
time
free
themselves
Harry
arms
and
legs
were
soon
covered
small
cuts
and
scratches
They
were
deep
the
Forest
now
that
sometimes
all
Harry
could
see
Hagrid
the
gloom
was
massive
dark
shape
ahead
him
Any
sound
seemed
threatening
the
muffled
silence
The
breaking
twig
echoed
loudly
and
the
tiniest
rustle
movement
even
though
might
have
been
made
innocent
sparrow
caused
Harry
peer
through
the
gloom
for
culprit
occurred
him
that
had
never
managed
get
this
far
into
the
Forest
without
meeting
some
kind
creature
their
absence
struck
him
rather
ominous
Hagrid
would
all
right
lit
our
wands
said
Hermione
quietly
all
righ
Hagrid
whispered
back
fact
stopped
suddenly
and
turned
around
Hermione
walked
right
into
him
and
was
knocked
over
backwards
Harry
caught
her
just
before
she
hit
the
Forest
floor
Maybe

momen

said
Hagrid
Before
there
like
Good
said
Hermione
Harry
set
her
back
her
feet
They
both
murmured
Lumos
and
their
wand
tips
ignited
Hagrid
face
swam
through
the
gloom
the
light
the
two
wavering
beams
and
Harry
saw
again
that
looked
nervous
and
sad
Righ
said
Hagrid
Well
see
the
thing
took
great
breath
Well
there

chance

sack

said
Harry
and
Hermione
looked
each
other
then
back
him
But

long
Hermione
said
tentatively
What

Umbridge

And

Harry

Harry
and
Hermione
both
made
noises
protest
but
Hagrid
overrode
them
with
wave
one
his
enormous
hands
not
the
end

world
able
ter
help
Dumbledore

His
voice

and
broke
Don

hastily
Hermione
made
pat
his
arm
pulled
his
enormous
spotted
handkerchief
from
the
pocket
his
waistcoat
and
mopped
his
eyes
with
Look

Harry
once
What

Hagrid
gave
great
sniff
and
patted
Harry
wordlessly
the
shoulder
with
such
force
Harry
was
knocked
sideways
into
tree
knew
yeh

Hagrid
into
his
handkerchief
but
won
never
forget
well
mon
jus
little
bit
further
through
here
watch
yerselves
now
there
nettles
They
walked
silence
for
another
fifteen
minutes
Harry
had
opened
his
mouth
ask
how
much
further
they
had
when
Hagrid
threw
out
his
right
arm
signal
that
they
should
stop
Really
easy
said
softly
Very
quiet
now
They
crept
forwards
and
Harry
saw
that
they
were
facing
large
smooth
mound
earth
nearly
tall
Hagrid
that
thought
with
jolt
dread
was
sure
the
lair
some
enormous
animal
Trees
had
been
ripped
the
roots
all
around
the
mound
that
stood
bare
patch
ground
surrounded
heaps
trunks
and
boughs
that
formed
kind
fence
barricade
behind
which
Harry
Hermione
and
Hagrid
now
stood
Sleepin
breathed
Hagrid
Sure
enough
Harry
could
hear
distant
rhythmic
rumbling
that
sounded
like
pair
enormous
lungs
work
glanced
sideways
Hermione
who
was
gazing
the
mound
with
her
mouth
slightly
open
She
looked
utterly
terrified
Hagrid
she
said
whisper
barely
audible
over
the
sound
the
sleeping
creature
who
Harry
found
this
odd
question
What
was
the
one
had
been
planning
asking
Hagrid
you
told
said
Hermione
her
wand
now
shaking
her
hand
you
told
none
them
wanted
come
Harry
looked
from
her
Hagrid
and
then
realisation
hit
him
looked
back
the
mound
with
small
gasp
horror
The
great
mound
earth
which
Hermione
and
Hagrid
could
easily
have
stood
was
moving
slowly
and
down
time
with
the
deep
grunting
breathing
was
not
mound
all
was
the
curved
back
what
was
clearly
Well
didn
want
ter
come
said
Hagrid
sounding
desperate
But
had
ter
bring
him
Hermione
had
ter
But
why
asked
Hermione
who
sounded
though
she
wanted
cry
Why
what
Hagrid
knew

said
Hagrid
sounding
close
tears
himself
taught
him
few
manners
able
ter
take
him
outside
show
ryone
harmless
Harmless
said
Hermione
shrilly
and
Hagrid
made
frantic
hushing
noises
with
his
hands
the
enormous
creature
before
them
grunted
loudly
and
shifted
its
sleep
been
hurting
you
all
this
time
hasn
That
why
you
had
all
these
injuries

strength
said
Hagrid
earnestly
gettin
better
not
fightin
much
any
more
this
why

two
months

said
Hermione
distractedly
Hagrid
why

Wouldn

happier
with
his
own
people
They
were
all

Hermione

Hagrid
Small

Hermione
Small

said
Hagrid
tears
now
trickling
down
his
bruised
face
into
his
beard
See

Hermione
simply
stared
him
her
mouth
open
Hagrid
when

Hagrid

Maxime

Harry

Hagrid
twisting
his
enormous
hands
she
got
bit
tired
him
after
while
must
admit
split
the
journey
home
she
promised
not
ter

anyone
though
How

Harry

Hagrid

Hagrid

Hermione
flopping
down
ripped
tree
and
burying
her
face
her
hands
What
you
think

with
violent
giant
who
doesn
even

Well

Hagrid

his
hands
agitatedly
admit

swings
when

bad
mood
but
gettin
better
loads
better
settlin
down
well
What
are
those
ropes
for
then
Harry
asked
had
just
noticed
ropes
thick
saplings
stretching
from
around
the
trunks
the
largest
nearby
trees
towards
the
place
where
Grawp
lay
curled
the
ground
with
his
back
them
You
have
keep
him
tied
said
Hermione
faintly
Well
yeah
said
Hagrid
looking
anxious
See
like
say
doesn
really
know
own
strength
Harry
understood
now
why
there
had
been
such
suspicious
lack
any
other
living
creature
this
part
the
Forest
what
you
want
Harry
and
Ron
and
Hermione
asked
apprehensively
Look
after
him
said
Hagrid
croakily
After
gone
Harry
and
Hermione
exchanged
miserable
looks
Harry
uncomfortably
aware
that
had
already
promised
Hagrid
that
would
whatever
asked
What
what
does
that
involve
exactly
Hermione
enquired
Not
food
anythin
said
Hagrid
eagerly
can
get
his
own
food
problem
Birds
deer
stuff
company
needs
jus
knew
someone
was
carryin
tryin
ter
help
him
bit
teachin
him
yeh
know
Harry
said
nothing
but
turned
look
back
the
gigantic
form
lying
asleep
the
ground
front
them
Unlike
Hagrid
who
simply
looked
like
oversized
human
Grawp
looked
strangely
misshapen
What
Harry
had
taken
vast
mossy
boulder
the
left
the
great
earthen
mound
now
recognised
Grawp
head
was
much
larger
proportion
the
body
than
human
head
and
was
almost
perfectly
round
and
covered
with
tightly
curling
close
growing
hair
the
colour
bracken
The
rim
single
large
fleshy
ear
was
visible
top
the
head
which
seemed
sit
rather
like
Uncle
Vernon
directly
upon
the
shoulders
with
little
neck
between
The
back
under
what
looked
like
dirty
brownish
smock
comprised
animal
skins
sewn
roughly
together
was
very
broad
and
Grawp
slept
seemed
strain
little
the
rough
seams
the
skins
The
legs
were
curled
under
the
body
Harry
could
see
the
soles
enormous
filthy
bare
feet
large
sledges
resting
one
top
the
other
the
earthy
Forest
floor
You
want
teach
him
Harry
said
hollow
voice
now
understood
what
Firenze
warning
had
meant
His
attempt
not
working
would
better
abandon
course
the
other
creatures
who
lived
the
Forest
would
have
heard
Hagrid
fruitless
attempts
teach
Grawp
English
Yeah
even
yeh
jus
talk
ter
him
bit
said
Hagrid
hopefully
Cause
reckon
can
talk
ter
people
understand
more
that
all
like
really
want
ter
stay
Harry
looked
Hermione
who
peered
back
him
from
between
the
fingers
over
her
face
Kind
makes
you
wish
had
Norbert
back
doesn
said
and
she
gave
very
shaky
laugh
Yeh
then
said
Hagrid
who
did
not
seem
have
caught
what
Harry
had
just
said
said
Harry
already
bound
his
promise
try
Hagrid
knew
could
count
yeh
Harry
Hagrid
said
beaming
very
watery
way
and
dabbing
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
again
don
wan
yeh
ter
put
yerself
out
too
much
like

yeh

little
chat

Wha
said
Hermione
jumping
Hagrid
don
wake
him
really
don
need
But
Hagrid
had
already
stepped
over
the
great
tree
trunk
front
them
and
was
proceeding
towards
Grawp
When
was
about
ten
feet
away
lifted
long
broken
bough
from
the
ground
smiled
reassuringly
over
his
shoulder
Harry
and
Hermione
then
poked
Grawp
hard
the
middle
the
back
with
the
end
the
bough
The
giant
gave
roar
that
echoed
around
the
silent
Forest
birds
the
treetops
overhead
rose
twittering
from
their
perches
and
soared
away
front
Harry
and
Hermione
meanwhile
the
gigantic
Grawp
was
rising
from
the
ground
which
shuddered
placed
enormous
hand
upon
push
himself
his
knees
turned
his
head
see
who
and
what
had
disturbed
him
All
righ
Grawpy
said
Hagrid
would
cheery
voice
backing
away
with
the
long
bough
raised
ready
poke
Grawp
again
Had
nice
sleep
Harry
and
Hermione
retreated
far
they
could
while
still
keeping
the
giant
within
their
sights
Grawp
knelt
between
two
trees
had
not
yet
uprooted
They
looked
into
his
startlingly
huge
face
that
resembled
grey
full
moon
swimming
the
gloom
the
clearing
was
though
the
features
had
been
hewn
great
stone
ball
The
nose
was
stubby
and
shapeless
the
mouth
lopsided
and
full
misshapen
yellow
teeth
the
size
half
bricks
the
eyes
small
giant
standards
were
muddy
greenish
brown
and
just
now
were
half
gummed
together
with
sleep
Grawp
raised
dirty
knuckles
each
big
cricket
ball
his
eyes
rubbed
vigorously
then
without
warning
pushed
himself
his
feet
with
surprising
speed
and
agility
Harry
heard
Hermione
squeal
terrified
beside
him
The
trees
which
the
other
ends
the
ropes
around
Grawp
wrists
and
ankles
were
attached
creaked
ominously
was
Hagrid
had
said
least
sixteen
feet
tall
Gazing
blearily
around
Grawp
reached
out
hand
the
size
beach
umbrella
seized
bird
nest
from
the
upper
branches
towering
pine
and
turned
upside
down
with
roar
apparent
displeasure
that
there
was
bird
eggs
fell
like
grenades
towards
the
ground
and
Hagrid
threw
his
arms
over
his
head
protect
himself
Anyway
Grawpy
shouted
Hagrid
looking
apprehensively
case
further
falling
eggs
brought
some
friends

Remember

Remember

Grawpy
But
Grawp
merely
gave
another
low
roar
was
hard
say
whether
was
listening
Hagrid
whether
even
recognised
the
sounds
Hagrid
was
making
speech
had
now
seized
the
top
the
pine
tree
and
was
pulling
towards
him
evidently
for
the
simple
pleasure
seeing
how
far
would
spring
back
when
let
Now
Grawpy

that
shouted
Hagrid
Tha

Hagrid
shouted
Company

some

Hagrid
don
moaned
Hermione
but
Hagrid
had
already
raised
the
bough
again
and
gave
Grawp
knee
sharp
poke
The
giant
let
the
top
the
tree
which
swayed
alarmingly
and
deluged
Hagrid
with
rain
pine
needles
and
looked
down
This
said
Hagrid
hastening
over
where
Harry
and
Hermione
stood
Harry
Grawp
Harry
Potter

The
giant
had
only
just
realised
that
Harry
and
Hermione
were
there
They
watched
great
trepidation
lowered
his
huge
boulder
head
that
could
peer
blearily
them
this
Hermione
see
Her
Hagrid
hesitated
Turning
Hermione
said
Would

Hermione

GRAWPY
Grawp
hand
had
shot
out
nowhere
towards
Hermione
Harry
seized
her
and
pulled
her
backwards
behind
the
tree
that
Grawp
fist
scraped
the
trunk
but
closed
thin
air
BAD
BOY
GRAWPY
they
heard
Hagrid
yelling
Hermione
clung
Harry
behind
the
tree
shaking
and
whimpering
VERY
BAD
BOY
YEH
DON
GRAB
OUCH
Harry
poked
his
head
out
from
around
the
trunk
and
saw
Hagrid
lying
his
back
his
hand
over
his
nose
Grawp
apparently
losing
interest
had
straightened
and
was
again
engaged
pulling
back
the
pine
far
would
Righ
said
Hagrid
thickly
getting
with
one
hand
pinching
his
bleeding
nose
and
the
other
grasping
his
crossbow
well
there
yeh
are
yeh
met
him
now
know
yeh
when
yeh
come
back
Yeah
well
looked
Grawp
who
was
now
pulling
back
the
pine
with
expression
detached
pleasure
his
boulderish
face
the
roots
were
creaking
ripped
them
away
from
the
ground
Well
reckon
tha
enough
fer
one
day
said
Hagrid
back
now
shall
Harry
and
Hermione
nodded
Hagrid
shouldered
his
crossbow
again
and
still
pinching
his
nose
led
the
way
back
into
the
trees
Nobody
spoke
for
while
not
even
when
they
heard
the
distant
crash
that
meant
Grawp
had
pulled
over
the
pine
tree
last
Hermione
face
was
pale
and
set
Harry
could
not
think
single
thing
say
What
earth
was
going
happen
when
somebody
found
out
that
Hagrid
had
hidden
Grawp
the
Forbidden
Forest
And
had
promised
that
Ron
and
Hermione
would
continue
Hagrid
totally
pointless
attempts
civilise
the
giant
How
could
Hagrid
even
with
his
immense
capacity
delude
himself
that
fanged
monsters
were
loveably
harmless
fool
himself
that
Grawp
would
ever
fit
mix
with
humans
Hold
said
Hagrid
abruptly
just
Harry
and
Hermione
were
struggling
through
patch
thick
knotgrass
behind
him
pulled
arrow
out
the
quiver
over
his
shoulder
and
fitted
into
the
crossbow
Harry
and
Hermione
raised
their
wands
now
that
they
had
stopped
walking
they
too
could
hear
movement
close
blimey
said
Hagrid
quietly
thought
told
you
Hagrid
said
deep
male
voice
that
you
are
longer
welcome
here
man
naked
torso
seemed
for
instant
floating
towards
them
through
the
dappled
green
half
light
then
they
saw
that
his
waist
joined
smoothly
into
horse
chestnut
body
This
centaur
had
proud
high
cheekboned
face
and
long
black
hair
Like
Hagrid
was
armed
quiverful
arrows
and
longbow
were
slung
over
his
shoulders
How
are
yeh
Magorian
said
Hagrid
warily
The
trees
behind
the
centaur
rustled
and
four
five
more
centaurs
emerged
behind
him
Harry
recognised
the
black
bodied
and
bearded
Bane
whom
had
met
nearly
four
years
ago
the
same
night
had
met
Firenze
Bane
gave
sign
that
had
ever
seen
Harry
before
said
with
nasty
inflection
his
voice
before
turning
immediately
Magorian
agreed
think
what
would
this
human
ever
showed
his
face
the
Forest
again

Hagrid

Hagrid

Hermione
high
pitched
and
terrified
voice
both
Bane
and
the
grey
centaur
pawed
the
ground
let
please
let
Hagrid
moved
forwards
but
his
crossbow
was
still
raised
and
his
eyes
were
still
fixed
threateningly
upon
Magorian
know
what
you
are
keeping
the
Forest
Hagrid
Magorian
called
after
them
the
centaurs
slipped
out
sight
And
our
tolerance
waning
Hagrid
turned
and
gave
every
appearance
wanting
walk
straight
back
Magorian
Yeh

his
Forest

yelled
Harry
and
Hermione
both
pushed
with
all
their
might
against
Hagrid
moleskin
waistcoat
effort
keep
him
moving
forwards
Still
scowling
looked
down
his
expression
changed
mild
surprise
the
sight
them
both
pushing
him
seemed
not
have
felt
Calm
down
you
two
said
turning
walk
while
they
panted
along
behind
him
Ruddy
old
mules
though
Hagrid
said
Hermione
breathlessly
skirting
the
patch
nettles
they
had
passed
their
way
there
the
centaurs
don
want
humans
the
Forest
doesn
really
look
though
Harry
and
will
able
you
heard
what
they
said
said
Hagrid
dismissively
they
wouldn
hurt
foals
mean
kids
Anyway
can
let
ourselves
pushed
aroun
that
lot
Nice
try
Harry
murmured
Hermione
who
looked
crestfallen
last
they
rejoined
the
path
and
after
another
ten
minutes
the
trees
began
thin
they
were
able
see
patches
clear
blue
sky
again
and
the
distance
the
definite
sounds
cheering
and
shouting
Was
that
another
goal
asked
Hagrid
pausing
the
shelter
the
trees
the
Quidditch
stadium
came
into
view
yeh
reckon
the
match
over
don
know
said
Hermione
miserably
Harry
saw
that
she
looked
much
the
worse
for
wear
her
hair
was
full
twigs
and
leaves
her
robes
were
ripped
several
places
and
there
were
numerous
scratches
her
face
and
arms
knew
must
look
little
better
reckon
over
yeh
know
said
Hagrid
still
squinting
towards
the
stadium
Look

ter
blend
with
the
crowd

Good

said
Harry
Well

later
then
Hagrid

said
Hermione
very
unsteady
voice
the
moment
they
were
out
earshot
Hagrid
don
believe
him
Ireally

Calm

said
Harry
Calm

said
feverishly

the
Forest
And

Always

get
past
the
herd
murderous
centaurs
the
way
and
out
don
believe
him

got
anything
yet
Harry
tried
reassure
her
quiet
voice
they
joined
stream
jabbering
Hufflepuffs
heading
back
towards
the
castle
not
asking
anything
unless
gets
chucked
out
and
that
might
not
even
happen
come
off
Harry
said
Hermione
angrily
stopping
dead
her
tracks
that
the
people
behind
had
swerve
avoid
her
course
going
chucked
out
and
perfectly
honest
after
what
just
seen
who
can
blame
Umbridge
There
was
pause
which
Harry
glared
her
and
her
eyes
filled
slowly
with
tears
You
didn
mean
that
said
Harry
quietly
well
all
right
didn
she
said
wiping
her
eyes
angrily
But
why
does
have
make
life
difficult
for
himself
for
dunno
Weasley
our
King
Weasley
our
King
didn
let
the
Quaffle
Weasley
our
King
And
wish
they
stop
singing
that
stupid
song
said
Hermione
miserably
haven
they
gloated
enough
great
tide
students
was
moving
the
sloping
lawns
from
the
pitch
let
get
before
have
meet
the
Slytherins
said
Hermione
Weasley
can
save
anything
never
leaves
single
ring
That
why
Gryffindors
all
sing
Weasley
our
King
Hermione
said
Harry
slowly
The
song
was
growing
louder
but
was
issuing
not
from
crowd
green
and
silver
clad
Slytherins
but
from
mass
red
and
gold
moving
slowly
towards
the
castle
bearing
solitary
figure
upon
its
many
shoulders
Weasley
our
King
Weasley
our
King
didn
let
the
Quaffle
Weasley
our
King
said
Hermione
hushed
voice
YES
said
Harry
loudly
HARRY
HERMIONE
yelled
Ron
waving
the
silver
Quidditch
cup
the
air
and
looking
quite
beside
himself
DID
WON
They
beamed
him
passed
There
was
scrum
the
door
the
castle
and
Ron
head
got
rather
badly
bumped
the
lintel
but
nobody
seemed
want
put
him
down
Still
singing
the
crowd
squeezed
itself
into
the
Entrance
Hall
and
out
sight
Harry
and
Hermione
watched
them
beaming
until
the
last
echoing
strains
Weasley
our
King
died
away
Then
theyturned
each
other
their
smiles
fading
save
our
news
till
tomorrow
shall
said
Harry
Yes
all
right
said
Hermione
wearily
not
any
hurry
They
climbed
the
steps
together
the
front
doors
both
instinctively
looked
back
the
Forbidden
Forest
Harry
was
not
sure
whether
not
was
his
imagination
but
rather
thought
saw
small
cloud
birds
erupting
into
the
air
over
the
tree
tops
the
distance
almost
though
the
tree
which
they
had
been
nesting
had
just
been
pulled
the
roots
Ron
euphoria
helping
Gryffindor
scrape
the
Quidditch
cup
was
such
that
couldn
settle
anything
next
day
All
wanted
was
talk
over
the
match
Harry
and
Hermione
found
very
difficult
find
opening
which
mention
Grawp
Not
that
either
them
tried
very
hard
neither
was
keen
the
one
bring
Ron
back
reality
quite
such
brutal
fashion
was
another
fine
warm
day
they
persuaded
him
join
them
revising
under
the
beech
tree
the
edge
the
lake
where
they
had
less
chance
being
overheard
than
the
common
room
Ron
was
not
particularly
keen
this
idea
first
was
thoroughly
enjoying
being
patted
the
back
every
Gryffindor
who
walked
past
his
chair
not
mention
the
occasional
outbursts
Weasley
our
King
but
after
while
agreed
that
some
fresh
air
might
him
good
They
spread
their
books
out
the
shade
the
beech
tree
and
sat
down
while
Ron
talked
them
through
his
first
save
the
match
for
what
felt
like
the
dozenth
time
Well
mean
already
let
that
one
Davies
wasn
feeling
all
that
confident
but
dunno
when
Bradley
came
towards
just
out
nowhere
thought
you
can
this
And
had
about
second
decide
which
way
fly
you
know
because
looked
like
was
aiming
for
the
right
goalhoop
right
obviously
his
left
but
had
funny
feeling
that
was
feinting
and
took
the
chance
and
flew
left
his
right
mean
and
well
you
saw
what
happened
concluded
modestly
sweeping
his
hair
back
quite
unnecessarily
that
looked
interestingly
windswept
and
glancing
around
see
whether
the
people
nearest
them
bunch
gossiping
third
year
Hufflepuffs
had
heard
him
And
then
when
Chambers
came
about
five
minutes
later
What
Ron
asked
having
stopped
mid
sentence
the
look
Harry
face
Why
are
you
grinning
not
said
Harry
quickly
and
looked
down
his
Transfiguration
notes
attempting
straighten
his
face
The
truth
was
that
Ron
had
just
reminded
Harry
forcibly
another
Gryffindor
Quidditch
player
who
had
once
sat
rumpling
his
hair
under
this
very
tree
just
glad
won
that
all
Yeah
said
Ron
slowly
savouring
the
words
won
Did
you
see
the
look
Chang
face
when
Ginny
got
the
Snitch
right
out
from
under
her
nose
suppose
she
cried
did
she
said
Harry
bitterly
Well
yeah
more
out
temper
than
anything
though
Ron
frowned
slightly
But
you
saw
her
chuck
her
broom
away
when
she
got
back
the
ground
didn
you
said
Harry
Well
actually
Ron
said
Hermione
with
heavy
sigh
putting
down
her
book
and
looking
him
apologetically
matter
fact
the
only
bit
the
match
Harry
and
saw
was
Davies
first
goal
Ron
carefully
ruffled
hair
seemed
wilt
with
disappointment
You
didn
watch
said
faintly
looking
from
one
the
other
You
didn
see
make
any
those
saves
Well
said
Hermione
stretching
out
placatory
hand
towards
him
But
Ron
didn
want
leave
had
Yeah
said
Ron
whose
face
was
growing
rather
red
How
come
was
Hagrid
said
Harry
decided
tell
why
been
covered
injuries
ever
since
got
back
from
the
giants
wanted
into
the
Forest
with
him
had
choice
you
know
how
gets
Anyway
The
story
was
told
five
minutes
the
end
which
Ron
indignation
had
been
replaced
look
total
incredulity
brought
one
back
and
hid
the
Forest
Yep
said
Harry
grimly
said
Ron
though
saying
this
could
make
untrue
can
have
Well
has
said
Hermione
firmly
Grawp
about
sixteen
feet
tall
enjoys
ripping
twenty
foot
pine
trees
and
knows
she
snorted
Hermy
Ron
gave
nervous
laugh
And
Hagrid
wants
Teach
him
English
yeah
said
Harry
lost
his
mind
said
Ron
almost
awed
voice
Yes
said
Hermione
irritably
turning
page
ofIntermediate
Transfiguration
and
glaring
series
diagrams
showing
owl
turning
into
pair
opera
glasses
Yes
starting
think
has
But
unfortunately
made
Harry
and
promise
Well
you
just
going
have
break
your
promise
that
all
said
Ron
firmly
mean
come
got
exams
and
about
that
far
held
his
hand
show
thumb
and
forefinger
almost
touching
from
being
chucked
out
And
anyway
remember
Norbert
Remember
Aragog
Have
ever
come
off
better
for
mixing
with
any
Hagrid
monster
mates
know
just
that
promised
said
Hermione
small
voice
Ron
smoothed
his
hair
flat
again
looking
preoccupied
Well
sighed
Hagrid
hasn
been
sacked
yet
has
hung
this
long
maybe
hang
till
the
end
term
and
won
have
near
Grawp
all
The
castle
grounds
were
gleaming
the
sunlight
though
freshly
painted
the
cloudless
sky
smiled
itself
the
smoothly
sparkling
lake
the
satin
green
lawns
rippled
occasionally
gentle
breeze
June
had
arrived
but
the
fifth
years
this
meant
only
one
thing
their
were
upon
them
last
Their
teachers
were
longer
setting
them
homework
lessons
were
devoted
revising
those
topics
the
teachers
thought
most
likely
come
the
exams
The
purposeful
feverish
atmosphere
drove
nearly
everything
but
the
from
Harry
mind
though
did
wonder
occasionally
during
Potions
lessons
whether
Lupin
had
ever
told
Snape
that
must
continue
giving
Harry
Occlumency
tuition
had
then
Snape
had
ignored
Lupin
thoroughly
was
now
ignoring
Harry
This
suited
Harry
very
well
was
quite
busy
and
tense
enough
without
extra
classes
with
Snape
and
his
relief
Hermione
was
much
too
preoccupied
these
days
badger
him
about
Occlumency
she
was
spending
lot
time
muttering
herself
and
had
not
laid
out
any
elf
clothes
for
days
She
was
not
the
only
person
acting
oddly
the
drew
steadily
nearer
Ernie
Macmillan
had
developed
irritating
habit
interrogating
people
about
their
revision
practices
How
many
hours
you
think
you
doing
day
demanded
Harry
and
Ron
they
queued
outside
Herbology
manic
gleam
his
eyes
dunno
said
Ron
few
More
less
than
eight
Less
pose
said
Ron
looking
slightly
alarmed
doing
eight
said
Ernie
puffing
out
his
chest
Eight
nine
getting
hour
before
breakfast
every
day
Eight
average
can
ten
good
weekend
day
did
nine
and
half
Monday
Not
good
Tuesday
only
seven
and
quarter
Then
Wednesday
Harry
was
deeply
thankful
that
Professor
Sprout
ushered
them
into
greenhouse
three
that
point
forcing
Ernie
abandon
his
recital
Meanwhile
Draco
Malfoy
had
found
different
way
induce
panic
course
not
what
you
know
was
heard
tell
Crabbe
and
Goyle
loudly
outside
Potions
few
days
before
the
exams
were
start
who
you
know
Now
Father
been
friendly
with
the
head
the
Wizarding
Examinations
Authority
for
years
old
Griselda
Marchbanks
had
her
round
for
dinner
and
everything
you
think
that
true
Hermione
whispered
alarm
Harry
and
Ron
Nothing
can
about
said
Ron
gloomily
don
think
true
said
Neville
quietly
from
behind
them
Because
Griselda
Marchbanks
friend
gran
and
she
never
mentioned
the
Malfoys
What
she
like
Neville
asked
Hermione
once
she
strict
Bit
like
Gran
really
said
Neville
subdued
voice
Knowing
her
won
hurt
your
chances
though
will
Ron
told
him
encouragingly
don
think
will
make
any
difference
said
Neville
still
more
miserably
Gran
always
telling
Professor
Marchbanks
not
good
dad
well
you
saw
what
she
like
Mungo
Neville
looked
fixedly
the
floor
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
glanced
each
other
but
didn
know
what
say
was
the
first
time
Neville
had
acknowledged
that
they
had
met
the
wizarding
hospital
Meanwhile
flourishing
black
market
trade
aids
concentration
mental
agility
and
wakefulness
had
sprung
among
the
fifth
and
seventh
years
Harry
and
Ron
were
much
tempted
the
bottle
Baruffio
Brain
Elixir
offered
them
Ravenclaw
sixth
year
Eddie
Carmichael
who
swore
was
solely
responsible
for
the
nine
Outstanding
had
gained
the
previous
summer
and
was
offering
whole
pint
for
mere
twelve
Galleons
Ron
assured
Harry
would
reimburse
him
for
his
half
the
moment
left
Hogwarts
and
got
job
but
before
they
could
close
the
deal
Hermione
had
confiscated
the
bottle
from
Carmichael
and
poured
the
contents
down
toilet
Hermione
wanted
buy
that
shouted
Ron
Don
stupid
she
snarled
You
might
well
take
Harold
Dingle
powdered
dragon
claw
and
have
done
with
Dingle
got
powdered
dragon
claw
said
Ron
eagerly
Not
any
more
said
Hermione
confiscated
that
too
None
these
things
actually
work
you
know
Dragon
claw
does
work
said
Ron
supposed
incredible
really
gives
your
brain
boost
you
come
over
all
cunning
for
few
hours
Hermione
let
have
pinch
can
hurt
This
stuff
can
said
Hermione
grimly
had
look
and
actually
dried
Doxy
droppings
This
information
took
the
edge
off
Harry
and
Ron
desire
for
brain
stimulants
They
received
their
examination
timetables
and
details
the
procedure
for
during
their
next
Transfiguration
lesson

Gryffindor
Our
new
Headmistress
Professor
McGonagall
pronounced
the
word
with
the
same
look
her
face
that
Aunt
Petunia
had
whenever
she
was
contemplating
particularly
stubborn
bit

asked
the

the

Professor
McGonagall
gave
tiny
sigh
Harry
saw
the
nostrils
her
sharp
nose
flare
however
that
reason
not
your
very
best
You
have
your
own
futures

Professor
McGonagall
Excellent

Dean
Thomas
audible

Harry
imagined
sitting
his
bedroom
Privet
Drive
six
weeks
time
waiting
for
his
results
Well
thought
dully
least
would
sure
one
bit
post
that
summer
Their
first
examination
Theory
Charms
was
scheduled
for
Monday
morning
Harry
agreed
test
Hermione
after
lunch
Sunday
but
regretted
almost
once
she
was
very
agitated
and
kept
snatching
the
book
back
from
him
check
that
she
had
got
the
answer
completely
right
finally
hitting
him
hard
the
nose
with
the

Why

said
firmly
handing
the
book
back
her
his
eyes
watering
Meanwhile
Ron
was
reading
two
years
worth
Charms
notes
with
his
fingers
his
ears
his
lips
moving
soundlessly
Seamus
Finnigan
was
lying
flat
his
back
the
floor
reciting
the
definition
Substantive
Charm
while
Dean
checked
againstThe
Standard
Book
Spells
Grade
and
Parvati
and
Lavender
who
were
practising
basic
Locomotion
Charms
were
making
their
pencil
cases
race
each
other
around
the
edge
the
table
Dinner
was
subdued
affair
that
night
Harry
and
Ron
did
not
talk
much
but
ate
with
gusto
having
studied
hard
all
day
Hermione
the
other
hand
kept
putting
down
her
knife
and
fork
and
diving
under
the
table
for
her
bag
from
which
she
would
seize
book
check
some
fact
figure
Ron
was
just
telling
her
that
she
ought
eat
decent
meal
she
would
not
sleep
that
night
when
her
fork
slid
from
her
limp
fingers
and
landed
with
loud
tinkle
her
plate
goodness
she
said
faintly
staring
into
the
Entrance
Hall
that
them
that
the
examiners
Harry
and
Ron
whipped
around
their
bench
Through
the
doors
the
Great
Hall
they
could
see
Umbridge
standing
with
small
group
ancient
looking
witches
and
wizards
Umbridge
Harry
was
pleased
see
looked
rather
nervous
Shall
and
have
closer
look
said
Ron
Harry
and
Hermione
nodded
and
they
hastened
towards
the
double
doors
into
the
Entrance
Hall
slowing
down
they
stepped
over
the
threshold
walk
sedately
past
the
examiners
Harry
thought
Professor
Marchbanks
must
the
tiny
stooped
witch
with
face
lined
looked
though
had
been
draped
cobwebs
Umbridge
was
speaking
her
deferentially
Professor
Marchbanks
seemed
little
deaf
she
was
answering
Professor
Umbridge
very
loudly
considering
they
were
only
foot
apart
Journey
was
fine
journey
was
fine
made
plenty
times
before
she
said
impatiently
Now

heard
from

she
added
peering
around
the
Hall
though
hopeful
might
suddenly
emerge
from

None
all
said
Umbridge
shooting
malevolent
look
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
who
were
now
dawdling
around
the
foot
the
stairs
Ron
pretended
his
shoelace
But
daresay
the
Ministry
Magic
will
track
him
down
soon

Yes

said
Professor
Umbridge
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
dragged
their
feet
the
marble
staircase
slowly
they
dared
let
show
you
the
staff
room
daresay
you
like
cup
tea
after
your
journey
was
uncomfortable
sort
evening
Everyone
was
trying
some
last
minute
revising
but
nobody
seemed
getting
very
far
Harry
went
bed
early
but
then
lay
awake
for
what
felt
like
hours
remembered
his
careers
consultation
and
McGonagall
furious
declaration
that
she
would
help
him
become
Auror
was
the
last
thing
she
did
wished
had
expressed
more
achievable
ambition
now
that
exam
time
was
here
knew
was
not
the
only
one
lying
awake
but
none
the
others
the
dormitory
spoke
and
finally
one
one
they
fell
asleep
None
the
fifth
years
talked
very
much
breakfast
next
day
either
Parvati
was
practising
incantations
under
her
breath
while
the
salt
cellar
front
her
twitched
Hermione
was
rereadingAchievements
Charming
fast
that
her
eyes
appeared
blurred
and
Neville
kept
dropping
his
knife
and
fork
and
knocking
over
the
marmalade
Once
breakfast
was
over
the
fifth
and
seventh
years
milled
around
the
Entrance
Hall
while
the
other
students
went
off
lessons
then
half
past
nine
they
were
called
forwards
class
class
enter
the
Great
Hall
which
had
been
rearranged
exactly
Harry
had
seen
the
Pensieve
when
his
father
Sirius
and
Snape
had
been
taking
their
the
four
house
tables
had
been
removed
and
replaced
instead
with
many
tables
for
one
all
facing
the
staff
table
end
the
Hall
where
Professor
McGonagall
stood
facing
them
When
they
were
all
seated
and
quiet
she
said
You
may
begin
and
turned
over
enormous
hour
glass
the
desk
beside
her
which
there
were
also
spare
quills
ink
bottles
and
rolls
parchment
Harry
turned
over
his
paper
his
heart
thumping
hard
three
rows
his
right
and
four
seats
ahead
Hermione
was
already
scribbling
and
lowered
his
eyes
the
first
question
Give
the
incantation
and
describe
the
wand
movement
required
make
objects
fly
Harry
had
fleeting
memory
club
soaring
high
into
the
air
and
landing
loudly
the
thick
skull
troll
smiling
slightly
bent
over
the
paper
and
began
write
Well

too
bad

asked
Hermione
anxiously
the
Entrance
Hall
two
hours
later
still
clutching
the
exam
paper
not
sure
did
myself
justice
Cheering
Charms
just
ran
out

Did
you

Hermione
said
Ron
sternly

through
this
before
not

exam
afterwards
bad
enough
doing

The
fifth
years
ate
lunch
with
the
rest
the
school
the
four
house
tables
had
reappeared
for
the
lunch
hour
then
they
trooped
off
into
the
small
chamber
beside
the
Great
Hall
where
they
were
wait
until
called
for
their
practical
examination
small
groups
students
were
called
forwards
alphabetical

those
left
behind
muttered
incantations
and
practised
wand
movements
occasionally
poking
each
other

back

Hermione
name
was
called
Trembling
she
left
the
chamber
with
Anthony
Goldstein
Gregory
Goyle
and
Daphne
Greengrass
Students
who
had
already
been
tested
did
not
return
afterwards
Harry
and
Ron
had
idea
how
Hermione
had
done
She
fine
remember
she
got
hundred
and
twelve
per

our

said
Ron
Ten
minutes
later
Professor
Flitwick
called
Parkinson
Pansy
Patil
Padma
Patil
Parvati
Potter
Harry
Good
luck
said
Ron
quietly
Harry
walked
into
the
Great
Hall
clutching
his
wand
tightly
his
hand
shook
Professor
Tofty
free
Potter
squeaked
Professor
Flitwick
who
was
standing
just
inside
the
door
pointed
Harry
towards
what
looked
like
the
very
oldest
and
baldest
examiner
whowas
sitting
behind
small
table
far
corner
short
distance
from
Professor
Marchbanks
who
was
halfway
through
testing
Draco
Malfoy
Potter
said
Professor
Tofty
consulting
his
notes
and
peering
over
his
pince
nez
Harry
approached
The
famous
Potter
Out
the
corner
his
eye
Harry
distinctly
saw
Malfoy
throw
scathing
look
over
him
the
wine
glass
Malfoy
had
been
levitating
fell
the
floor
and
smashed
Harry
could
not
suppress
grin
Professor
Tofty
smiled
back
him
encouragingly
That
said
his
quavery
old
voice
need
nervous
Now
could
ask
you
take
this
egg
cup
and
make
some
cartwheels
for
the
whole
Harry
thought
went
rather
well
His
Levitation
Charm
was
certainly
much
better
than
Malfoy
had
been
though
wished
had
not
mixed
the
incantations
for
Colour
Change
and
Growth
Charms
that
the
rat
was
supposed
turning
orange
swelled
shockingly
and
was
the
size
badger
before
Harry
could
rectify
his
mistake
was
glad
Hermione
had
not
been
the
Hall
thetime
and
neglected
mention
her
afterwards
could
tell
Ron
though
Ron
had
caused
dinner
plate
mutate
into
large
mushroom
and
had
idea
how
had
happened
There
was
time
relax
that
night
they
went
straight
the
common
room
after
dinner
and
submerged
themselves
revision
for
Transfiguration
next
day
Harry
went
bed
with
his
head
buzzing
with
complex
spell
models
and
theories
forgot
the
definition
Switching

during
his
written
paper
next
morning
but
thought
his

could
have
been

worse

managed
Vanish
the

whereas
poor
Hannah
Abbott
lost
her
head
completely
the
next

and
somehow
managed

into

flamingos
causing
the
examination
halted
for
ten
minutes
while
the
birds
were
captured
and
carried
out
the
Hall
They
had
their
Herbology
exam
Wednesday
other
than
small
bite
from
Fanged
Geranium
Harry
felt
had
done
reasonably
well
and
then
Thursday
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
Here
for
the
first
time
Harry
felt
sure
had
passed
had
problem
with
any
the
written
questions
and
took
particular
pleasure
during
the
practical
examination
performing
all
the
counter
jinxes
and
defensive
spells
right
front
Umbridge
who
was
watching
coolly
from
near
the
doors
into
the
Entrance
Hall
bravo
cried
Professor
Tofty
who
was
examining
Harry
again
when
Harry
demonstrated
perfect
Boggart
banishing
spell
Very
good
indeed
Well
think
that
all
Potter
unless
leaned
forwards
little
heard
from
dear
friend
Tiberius
Ogden
that
you
can
produce
Patronus
For
bonus
point
Harry
raised
his
wand
looked
directly
Umbridge
and
imagined
her
being
sacked
Expecto
patronum
His
silver
stag
erupted
from
the
end
his
wand
and
cantered
the
length
the
Hall
All
the
examiners
looked
around
watch
its
progress
and
when
dissolved
into
silver
mist
Professor
Tofty
clapped
his
veined
and
knotted
hands
enthusiastically
Excellent
said
Very
well
Potter
you
may
Harry
passed
Umbridge
beside
the
door
their
eyes
met
There
was
nasty
smile
playing
around
her
wide
slack
mouth
but
did
not
care
Unless
was
very
much
mistaken
and
was
not
planning
telling
anybody

Outstanding
Friday
Harry
and
Ron
had
day
off
while
Hermione
sat
her
Ancient
Runes
exam
and
they
had
the
whole
weekend
front
them
they
permitted
themselves
break
from
revision
They
stretched
and
yawned
beside
the
open
window
through
which
warm
summer
air
was
wafting
they
played
wizard
chess
Harry
could
see
Hagrid
the
distance
teaching
class
the
edge
the
Forest
was
trying
guess
what
creatures
they
were
examining
thought
must
unicorns
because
the
boys
seemed
standing
back
little
when
the
portrait
hole
opened
and
Hermione
clambered
looking
thoroughly
bad
tempered
How
were

Ron

And

don

how
they
got
through
that
new
door
but
just
walked
past
there
and
Umbridge
isshrieking
her
head
off
the
sound
tried
take
chunk
out
her
leg
Good
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
not

Hermione
hotly
She

You

said
Hermione
who
seemed
determined
towering

and
she
swept
off
towards
the
girls
dormitories
banging
the
door
behind
her
Such

quietly

Hermione
bad
mood
persisted
for
most
the
weekend
though
Harry
and
Ron
found
quite
easy
ignore
they
spent
most
Saturday
and
Sunday
revising
for
Potions
Monday
the
exam
which
Harry
had
been
looking
forward
least
and
which
was
sure
would
the
downfall
his
ambitions
become
Auror
Sure
enough
found
the
written
paper
difficult
though
thought
might
have
got
full
marks
the
question
about
Polyjuice
Potion
could
describe
its
effects
accurately
having
taken
illegally
his
second
year
The
afternoon
practical
was
not
dreadful
had
expected
With
Snape
absent
from
the
proceedings
found
that
was
much
more
relaxed
than
usually
was
while
making
potions
Neville
who
was
sitting
very
near
Harry
also
looked
happier
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
him
during
Potions
class
When
Professor
Marchbanks
said
Step
away
from
your
cauldrons
please
the
examination
over
Harry
corked
his
sample
flask
feeling
that
might
not
have
achieved
good
grade
but
had
with
luck
avoided
fail
Only
four
exams
left
said
Parvati

wearily
they
headed

room
Only
said
Hermione
snappishly
got
Arithmancy
and
probably
the
toughest
subject
there
Nobody
was
foolish
enough
snap
back
she
was
unable
vent
her
spleen
any
them
and
was
reduced
telling
off
some
first
years
for
giggling
too
loudly
the
common
room
Harry
was
determined
perform
well
Tuesdays
Care
Magical
Creatures
exam
not
let
Hagrid
down
The
practical
examination
took
place
the
afternoon
the
lawn
the
edge
the
Forbidden
Forest
where
students
were
required
correctly
identify
the
Knarl
hidden
among
dozen
hedgehogs
the
trick
was
offer
them
all
milk
turn
Knarls
highly
suspicious
creatures
whose
quills
had
many
magical
properties
generally
went
berserk
what
they
saw
attempt
poison
them
then
demonstrate
correct
handling
Bowtruckle
feed
and
clean
out
Fire
Crab
without
sustaining
serious
burns
and
choose
from
wide
selection
food
the
diet
they
would
give
sick
unicorn
Harry
could
see
Hagrid
watching
anxiously
out
his
cabin
window
When
Harry
examiner
plump
little
witch
this
time
smiled
him
and
told
him
could
leave
Harry
gave
Hagrid
fleeting
thumbs
before
heading
back
the
castle
The
Astronomy
theory
paper
Wednesday
morning
went
well
enough
Harry
was
not
convinced
had
got
the
names
all
Jupiter
moons
right
but
was
least
confident
that
none
them
was
inhabited
mice
They
had
wait
until
evening
for
their
practical
Astronomy
the
afternoon
was
devoted
instead
Divination
Even
Harry
low
standards
Divination
the
exam
went
very
badly
might
well
have
tried
see
moving
pictures
the
desktop
the
stubbornly
blank
crystal
ball
lost
his
head
completely
during
tea
leaf
reading
saying
looked

though
Professor
Marchbanks
would
shortly
meeting
round
dark
soggy
stranger
and
rounded
off
the
whole
fiasco
mixing
the
life
and
head
lines
her
palm
and
informing
her
that
she
ought
have
died
the
previous
Tuesday
Well
were
always
going
fail
that
one
said
Ron
gloomily
they
ascended
the
marble
staircase
had
just
made
Harry
feel
rather
better
telling
him
how
had
told
the
examiner
detail
about
the
ugly
man
with
wart
his
nose
his
crystal
ball
only
look
and
realise
had
been
describing
his
examiner
reflection
shouldn
have
taken
the
stupid
subject
the
first
place
said
Harry
Still
least
can
give
now
Yeah
said
Harry
more
pretending
care
what
happens
when
Jupiter
and
Uranus
get
too
friendly
And
from
now

Ron

just
chucking

Harry
laughed
just
Hermione
came
running
behind
them
stopped
laughing
once
case
annoyed
her
Well
think
done
all
right
Arithmancy
she
said
and
Harry
and
Ron
both
sighed
with
relief
Just
time
for
quick
look
over
our
star
charts
before
dinner
then
When
they
reached
the
top
the
Astronomy
Tower
eleven
clock
they
found
perfect
night
for
stargazing
cloudless
and
still
The
grounds
were
bathed
silvery
moonlight
and
there
was
slight
chill
the
air
Each
them
set
his
her
telescope
and
when
Professor
Marchbanks
gave
the
word
proceeded
fill
the
blank
star
chart
they
had
been
given
Professors
Marchbanks
and
Tofty
strolled
among
them
watching
they
entered
the
precise
positions
the
stars
and
planets
they
were
observing
All
was
quiet
except
for
the
rustle
parchment
the
occasional
creak
telescope
was
adjusted
its
stand
and
the
scribbling
many
quills
Half
hour
passed
then
hour
the
little
squares
reflected
gold
light
flickering
the
ground
below
started
vanish
lights
the
castle
windows
were
extinguished
Harry
completed
the
constellation
Orion
his
chart
however
the
front
doors
the
castle
opened
directly
below
the
parapet
where
was
standing
that
light
spilled
down
the
stone
steps
little
way
across
the
lawn
Harry
glanced
down
made
slight
adjustment
the
position
his
telescope
and
saw
five
orsix
elongated
shadows
moving
over
the
brightly
lit
grass
before
the
doors
swung
shut
and
the
lawn
became
sea
darkness
once
more
Harry
put
his
eye
back
his
telescope
and
refocused
now
examining
Venus
looked
down
his
chart
enter
the
planet
there
but
something
distracted
him
pausing
with
his
quill
suspended
over
the
parchment
squinted
down
into
the
shadowy
grounds
and
saw
half
dozen
figures
walking
over
the
lawn
they
had
not
been
moving
and
the
moonlight
had
not
been
gilding
the
tops
their
heads
they
would
have
been
indistinguishable
from
the
dark
ground
which
they
walked
Even
this
distance
Harry
had
funny
feeling
recognised
the
walk
the
squattest
them
who
seemed
leading
the
group
could
not
think
why
Umbridge
would
taking
stroll
outside
after
midnight
much
less
accompanied
five
others
Then
somebody
coughed
behind
him
and
remembered
that
was
halfway
through
exam
had
quite
forgotten
Venus
position
Jamming
his
eye
his
telescope
found
again
and
was
once
more
about
enter
his
chart
when
alert
for
any
odd
sound
heard
distant
knock
which
echoed
through
the
deserted
grounds
followed
immediately
the
muffled
barking
large
dog
looked
his
heart
hammering
There
were
lights
Hagrid
windows
and
the
people
had
observed
crossing
the
lawn
were
now
silhouetted
against
them
The
door
opened
and
distinctly
saw
six
sharply
defined
figures
walk
over
the
threshold
The
door
closed
again
and
there
was
silence
Harry
felt
very
uneasy
glanced
around
see
whether
Ron
Hermione
had
noticed
what
had
but
Professor
Marchbanks
came
walking
behind
him
that
moment
and
not
wanting
look
though
was
sneaking
looks
anyone
else
work
Harry
hastily
bent
over
his
star
chart
and
pretended
adding
notes
while
really
peering
over
the
top
the
parapet
towards
Hagrid
cabin
Figures
were
now
moving
across
the
cabin
windows
temporarily
blocking
the
light
could
feel
Professor
Marchbanks
eyes
the
back
his
neck
and
pressed
his
eye
again
his
telescope
staring
the
moon
though
had
marked
its
position
hour
ago
but
Professor
Marchbanks
moved
heard
roar
from
the
distant
cabin
that
echoed
through
the
darkness
right
the
top
the
Astronomy
Tower
Several
the
people
around
Harry
ducked
out
from
behind
their
telescopes
and
peered
instead
the
direction
Hagrid
cabin
Professor
Tofty
gave
another
dry
little
cough
Try
and
concentrate
now
boys
and
girls
said
softly
Most
people
returned
their
telescopes
Harry
looked
his
left
Hermione
was
gazing
transfixed
Hagrid
cabin
Ahem
twenty
minutes
said
Professor
Tofty
Hermione
jumped
and
returned
once
her
star
chart
Harry
looked
down
his
own
and
noticed
that
had
mis
labelled
Venus
Mars
bent
correct
There
was
loud
BANG
from
the
grounds
Several
people
cried
Ouch
when
they
poked
themselves
the
face
with
the
ends
their
telescopes
they
hastened
see
what
was
going
below
Hagrid
door
had
burst
open
and
the
light
flooding
out
the
cabin
they
saw
him
quite
clearly
massive
figure
roaring
and
brandishing
his
fists
surrounded
six
people
all
whom
judging
the
tiny
threads
red
light
they
were
casting
his
direction
seemed
attempting
Stun
him
cried
Hermione
dear
said
Professor
Tofty
scandalised
voice
This
examination
But
nobody
was
paying
the
slightest
attention
their
star
charts
any
more
Jets
red
light
were
still
flying
about
beside
Hagrid
cabin
yet
somehow
they
seemed
bouncing
off
him
was
still
upright
and
still
far
Harry
could
see
fighting
Cries
and
yells
echoed
across
the
grounds
man
yelled
reasonable
Hagrid
Hagrid
roared
Reasonable
damned
yeh
won
take
like
this
Dawlish
Harry
could
see
the
tiny
outline
Fang
attempting
defend
Hagrid
leaping
repeatedly
the
wizards
surrounding
him
until
Stunning
Spell
caught
him
and
fell
the
ground
Hagrid
gave
howl
fury
lifted
the
culprit
bodily
from
the
ground
and
threw
him
the
man
flew
what
looked
like
ten
feet
and
did
not
get
again
Hermione
gasped
both
hands
over
her
mouth
Harry
looked
round
Ron
and
saw
that
too
was
looking
scared
None
them
had
ever
seen
Hagrid
real
temper
before
Look
squealed
Parvati
who
was
leaning
over
the
parapet
and
pointing
the
foot
the
castle
where
the
front
doors
had
opened
again
more
light
was
spilling
out
the
dark
lawn
and
single
long
black
shadow
was
now
rippling
across
the
lawn
Now
really
said
Professor
Tofty
anxiously
Only
sixteen
minutes
left
you
know
But
nobody
paid
him
the
slightest
attention
they
were
watching
the
person
now
sprinting
towards
the
battle
beside
Hagrid
cabin
How
dare
you
the
figure
shouted
she
ran
Howdare
you
McGonagall
whispered
Hermione
Leave
him
alone
Alone
say
said
Professor
McGonagall
voice
through
the
darkness
what
grounds
are
you
attacking
him
has
done
nothing
nothing
warrant
such
Hermione
Parvati
and
Lavender
all
screamed
The
figures
around
the
cabin
had
shot
fewer
than
four
Stunners
Professor
McGonagall
Halfway
between
cabin
and
castle
the
red
beams
collided
with
her
for
moment
she
looked
luminous
and
glowed
eerie
red
then
she
lifted
right
off
her
feet
landed
hard
her
back
and
moved
more
Galloping
gargoyles
shouted
Professor
Tofty
who
also
seemed
have
forgotten
the
exam
completely
Not
much
warning
Outrageous
behaviour
COWARDS
bellowed
Hagrid
his
voice
carried
clearly
the
top
the
tower
and
several
lights
flickered
back
inside
the
castle
RUDDY
COWARDS
HAVE
SOME
THAT
THAT
gasped
Hermione
Hagrid
took
two
massive
swipes
his
closest
attackers
judging
their
immediate
collapse
they
had
been
knocked
cold
Harry
saw
Hagrid
double
over
and
thought
had
finally
been
overcome
spell
But
the
contrary
next
moment
Hagrid
was
standing
again
with
what
appeared
sack
his
back
then
Harry
realised
that
Fang
limp
body
was
draped
around
his
shoulders
Get
him
get
him
screamed
Umbridge
but
her
remaining
helper
seemed
highly
reluctant
within
reach
Hagrid
fists
indeed
was
backing
away
fast
tripped
over
one
his
unconscious
colleagues
and
fell
over
Hagrid
had
turned
and
begun
run
with
Fang
still
hung
around
hisneck
Umbridge
sent
one
last
Stunning
Spell
after
him
but
missed
and
Hagrid
running
full
pelt
towards
the
distant
gates
disappeared
into
the
darkness
There
was
long
minutes
quivering
silence
everybody
gazed
open
mouthed
into
the
grounds
Then
Professor
Tofty
voice
said
feebly
five
minutes
everybody
Though
had
only
filled
two
thirds
his
chart
Harry
was
desperate
for
the
exam
end
When
came
last
Ron
and
Hermione
forced
their
telescopes
haphazardly
back
into
their
holders
and
dashed
back
down
the
spiral
staircase
None
the
students
were
going
bed
they
were
all
talking
loudly
and
excitedly
the
foot
the
stairs
about
what
they
had
witnessed
That
evil
woman
gasped
Hermione
who
seemed
having
difficulty
talking
due
rage
Trying
sneak
Hagrid
the
dead
night
She
clearly
wanted
avoid
another
scene
like
Trelawney
said
Ernie
Macmillan
sagely
squeezing
over
join
them
Hagrid
did
well
didn
said
Ron
who
looked
more
alarmed
than
impressed
How
come
all
the
spells
bounced
off
him
his
giant
blood
said
Hermione
shakily
Its
very
hard
Stun
giant
they
like
trolls
really
tough
but
poor
Professor
McGonagall
four
Stunners
straight
the
chest
and
she
not
exactly
young
she
Dreadful
dreadful
said
Ernie
shaking
his
head
pompously
Well
off
bed
Night
all
People
around
them
were
drifting
away
still
talking
excitedly
about
what
they
had
just
seen
least
they
didn
get
take
Hagrid
off
Azkaban
said
Ron
spect

Dumbledore

said
Hermione
who
looked
tearful
this
awful
really
thought
Dumbledore
would
back
before
long
but
now
lost
Hagrid
too
They
traipsed
back
the
Gryffindor
common
room
find
full
The
commotion
out
the
grounds
had
woken
several
people
who
had
hastened
rouse
their
friends
Seamus
and
Dean
who
had
arrived
ahead
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
now
telling
everyone
what
they
had
seen
and
heard
from
the
top
the
Astronomy
Tower
But
why
sack
Hagrid
now
asked
Angelina
Johnson
shaking
her
head
not
like
Trelawney
been
teaching
much
better
than
usual
this
year
Umbridge
hates
part
humans
said
Hermione
bitterly
flopping
down
into
armchair
She
was
always
going
try
and
get
Hagrid
out
And
she
thought
Hagrid
was
putting
Nifflers

Katie

Dean

too

Dumbledore
That

said
Harry
sinking
into
armchair
beside
Hermione
just
hope
Professor
McGonagall
all
right
said
Lavender
tearfully
They
carried
her
back
the
castle

through
the
dormitory
window
said
Colin
Creevey
She
didn
look
very
well
Madam
Pomfrey

her
out
said
Alicia
Spinnet
firmly
She
never
failed
yet
was
nearly
four
the
morning
before
the
common
room
cleared
Harry
felt
wide
awake
the
image
Hagrid
sprinting
away
into
the
dark
was
haunting
him
was
angry
with
Umbridge
could
not
think
punishment
bad
enough
for
her
though
Ron
suggestion
having
her

starving
Blast
Ended
Skrewts
had
its
merits
fell
asleep
contemplating
hideous
revenges
and
arose
from
bed
three
hours
later
feeling
distinctly
unrested
Their
final
exam
History
Magic
was
not
take
place
until
that
afternoon
Harry
would
very
much
have
liked
back
bed
after
breakfast
but
had
been
counting
the
morning
for
spot
last
minute
revision
instead
sat
with
his
head
his
hands
the
common
room
window
trying
hard
not
doze
off
read
through
some
the
three
and
half
feet
high
stack
notes
that
Hermione
had
lent
him
The
fifth
years
entered
the
Great
Hall
two
clock
and
took
their
places
front
their
face
down
examination
papers
Harry
felt
exhausted
just
wanted
this
over
that
could
and
sleep
then
tomorrow
and
Ron

going
down
the
Quidditch
pitch
was
going
have
fly
Ron

and
savour
theirfreedom
from

Turn

your
papers
said
Professor
Marchbanks
from
the
front
the
Hall
flicking
over
the
giant
hour
glass
You
may
begin
Harry
stared
fixedly
the
first
question
was
several
seconds
before
occurred
him
that
had
not
taken
word
there
was
wasp
buzzing
distractingly
against
one
the
high
windows
Slowly
tortuously

began
write

very
difficult

kept
confusing

How

but
had
nagging
suspicion
that
had
missed
several
important
points
had
feeling
vampires
had
come
into
the
story
somewhere
looked
ahead
for
question
could
definitely
answer
and
his
eyes
alighted
upon
number
ten
Describe
the
circumstances
that
led
the
formation
the
International
Confederation
Wizards
and
explain
why
the
warlocks
Liechtenstein
refused
join
know
this
Harry
thought
though
his
brain
felt
torpid
and
slack
could
visualise
heading
Hermione
handwriting
The
formation
the
International
Confederation
Wizards
had
read
those
notes
only
this
morning
began
write
looking
now
and
again
check
the
large
hour
glass
the
desk
beside
Professor
Marchbanks
was
sitting
right
behind
Parvati
Patil
whose
long
dark
hair
fell
below
the
back
her
chair
Once
twice
found
himself
staring
the
tiny
golden
lights
that
glistened
when
shemoved
her
head
slightly
and
had
give
his
own
head
little
shake
clear
the
first
Supreme
Mugwump
the
International
Confederation
Wizards
was
Pierre
Bonaccord
but
his
appointment
was
contested
the
wizarding
community
Liechtenstein
because
All
around
Harry
quills
were
scratching
parchment
like
scurrying
burrowing
rats
The
sun
was
very
hot
the
back
his
head
What
was
that
Bonaccord
had
done
offend
the
wizards
Liechtenstein
Harry
had
feeling
had
something
with
trolls
gazed
blankly
the
back
Parvati
head
again
could
only
perform
Legilimency
and
open
window
the
back
her
head
and
see
what
was
about
trolls
that
had
caused
the
breach
between
Pierre
Bonaccord
and
Liechtenstein
Harry
closed
his
eyes
and
buried
his
face
his
hands
that
the
glowing
red
his
eyelids
grew
dark
and
cool
Bonaccord
had
wanted
stop
troll
hunting
and
give
the
trolls
rights
but
Liechtenstein
was
having
problems
with
tribe
particularly
vicious
mountain
trolls
that
was
opened
his
eyes
they
stung
and
watered
the
sight
the
blazing
white
parchment
Slowly
wrote
two
lines
about
the
trolls
then
read
through
what
had
done
far
did
not
seem
very
informative
detailed
yet
was
sure
Hermione
notes
the
Confederation
had
gone
for
pages
and
pages
closed
his
eyes
again
trying
see
them
trying
remember
the
Confederation
had
met
for
the
first
time
France
yes
had
written
that
already
Goblins
had
tried
attend
and
been
ousted
had
written
that
too
And
nobody
from
Liechtenstein
had
wanted
come
Think
told
himself
his
face
his
hands
while
all
around
him
quills
scratched
out
never
ending
answers
and
the
sand
trickled
through
the
hour
glass
the
front
was
walking
along
the
cool
dark
corridor
the
Department
Mysteries
again
walking
with
firm
and
purposeful
tread
breaking
occasionally
into
run
determined
reach
his
destination
last
the
black
door
swung
open
for
him
usual
and
here
was
the
circular
room
with
its
many
doors
Straight
across
the
stone
floor
and
through
the
second
door
patches
dancing
light
the
walls
and
floor
and
that
odd
mechanical
clicking
but
time
explore
must
hurry
jogged
the
last
few
feet
the
third
door
which
swung
open
just
like
the
others
Once
again
was
the
cathedral
sized
room
full
shelves
and
glass
spheres
his
heart
was
beating
very
fast
now
was
going
get
there
this
time
when
reached
number
ninety
seven
turned
left
and
hurried
along
the
aisle
between
two
rows
But
there
was
shape
the
floor
the
very
end
black
shape
moving
the
floor
like
wounded
animal
Harry
stomach
contracted
with
fear
with
excitement
voice
issued
from
his
own
mouth
high
cold
voice
empty
any
human
kindness
Take
for
lift
down
now
cannot
touch
but
you
can
The
black
shape
the
floor
shifted
little
Harry
saw
long
fingered
white
hand
clutching
wand
rise
the
end
his
own
arm
heard
the
high
cold
voice
say
Crucio
The
man
the
floor
let
out
scream
pain
attempted
stand
but
fell
back
writhing
Harry
was
laughing
raised
his
wand
the
curse
lifted
and
the
figure
groaned
and
became
motionless
Lord
Voldemort
waiting
Very
slowly
his
arms
trembling
the
man
the
ground
raised
his
shoulders
few
inches
and
lifted
his
head
His
face
was
bloodstained
and
gaunt
twisted
pain
yet
rigid
with
defiance
You
have
kill
whispered
Sirius
Undoubtedly
shall
the
end
said
the
cold
voice
But
you
will
fetch
for
first
Black
you
think
you
have
felt
pain
thus
far
Think
again
have
hours
ahead
and
nobody
hear
you
scream
But
somebody
screamed
Voldemort
lowered
his
wand
again
somebody
yelled
and
fell
sideways
off
hot
desk
the
cold
stone
floor
Harry
awoke
hit
the
ground
still
yelling
his
scar
fire
the
Great
Hall
erupted
all
around
him
OUT
THE
FIRE
not
going
don
need
the
hospital
wing
don
want
was
gibbering
tried
pull
away
from
Professor
Tofty
who
was
looking
Harry
with
much
concern
after
helping
him
out
into
the
Entrance
Hall
with
the
students
all
around
them
staring
fine
sir
Harry
stammered
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
face
Really
just
fell
asleep
had
nightmare
Pressure
examinations
said
the
old
wizard
sympathetically
patting
Harry
shakily
the
shoulder
happens
young
man
happens
Now
cooling
drink
water
and
perhaps
you
will
ready
return
the
Great
Hall
The
examination
nearly
over
but
you
may
able
round
off
your
last
answer
nicely
Yes
said
Harry
wildly
mean

doneas
much
can
think
Very
well
very
well
said
the
old
wizard
gently
shall
and
collect
your
examination
paper
and
suggest
that
you
and
have
nice
lie
down
that
said
Harry
nodding
vigorously
Thanks
very
much
The
second
that
the
old
man
heels
disappeared
over
the
threshold
into
the
Great
Hall
Harry
ran
the
marble
staircase
hurtled
along
the
corridors
fast
the
portraits
passed
muttered
reproaches
more
flights
stairs
and
finally
burst
like
hurricane
through
the
double
doors
the
hospital
wing
causing
Madam
Pomfrey
who
had
been
spooning
some
bright
blue
liquid
into
Montague
open
mouth
shriek
alarm
Potter
what
you
think
you
doing
need
see
Professor
McGonagall
gasped
Harry
the
breath
tearing
his
lungs
Now
urgent
She
not
here
Potter
said
Madam
Pomfrey
sadly
She
was
transferred
Mungo
this
morning
Four
Stunning
Spells
straight
the
chest
her
age
wonder
they
didn
kill
her
She
gone
said
Harry
shocked
The
bell
rang
just
outside
the
dormitory
and
heard
the
usual
distant
rumbling
students
starting
flood
out
into
the
corridors
above
and
below
him
remained
quite
still
looking
Madam
Pomfrey
Terror
was
rising
inside
him
There
was
nobody
left
tell
Dumbledore
had
gone
Hagrid
had
gone
but
had
always
expected
Professor
McGonagall
there
irascible
and
inflexible
perhaps
but
always
dependably
solidly
present
don
wonder
you
shocked
Potter
said
Madam
Pomfrey
with
kind
fierce
approval
her
face
one
them
could
have
Stunned
Minerva
McGonagall
face
daylight
Cowardice
that
what
was
despicable
cowardice
wasn
worried
what
would
happen
you
students
without
resign
protest
Yes
said
Harry
blankly
wheeled
around
and
strode
blindly
from
the
hospital
wing
into
the
teeming
corridor
where
stood
buffeted
the
crowd
panic
expanding
inside
him
like
poison
gas
that
his
head
swam
and
could
not
think
what
Ron
and
Hermione
said
voice
his
head
was
running
again
pushing
students
out
the
way
oblivious
their
angry
protests
sprinted
back
down
two
floors
and
was
the
top
the
marble

behind
Ron
and

the
moment
they
were

loudly
But
Harry

Ron
weakly
What
What

Harry
could
not
understand
why
they
were
both
gaping
him
though
was
asking
them
something
unreasonable
Harry
said
Hermione
rather
frightened
voice
how

did
Voldemort
get
into
the
Ministry
Magic
without
anybody
realising
was
there
How

bellowed
Harry
The

Hermione
quietly

Ron
quietly
looking
Hermione

But

earth
would
Voldemort
want
use
Sirius

Ron

The
classroom
door
opened
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
whipped
around
Ginny

curious
closely

Luna
who

looked
though
she
had
drifted

Ginny
uncertainly
recognised
Harry
voice
What

Never

Harry
roughly
Ginny
raised
her
eyebrows
There

said
coolly
was
only
wondering
whether

help
Well
you

said
Harry
shortly
You
being
rather
rude
you

said
Luna
serenely
Harry
swore
and
turned
away
The
very
last
thing
wanted
now
was
conversation
with
Luna
Lovegood
Wait
said
Hermione
suddenly
Wait

Harry
and
Ron
looked
her
Listen

said
urgently
Harry

Hermione
desperately

Hermione
who
looked
positively
terrified
the
thought
draw
Umbridge
away
again
but
need
lookouts
and
that
where
can
use
Ginny
and
Luna
Though
clearly
struggling
understand
what
was
going
Ginny
said
immediately
Yeah
and
Luna
said
When
you
say
Sirius
are
you
talking
about
Stubby
Boardman
Nobody
answered
her
Harry
said
aggressively
Hermione
you
can
think
way
doing
this
quickly
with
you
otherwise
going
the
Department
Mysteries
right
now
The
Department
Mysteries
said
Luna
looking
mildly
surprised
But
how
are
you
going
get
there
Again
Harry
ignored
her
Right
said
Hermione
twisting
her
hands
together
and
pacing
and
down
between
the
desks
Right
well
one
has
and
find
Umbridge
and
and
send
her
off
the
wrong
direction

They

Peeves

awful
usual
said
Ron
once
tell
her
Peeves

the
Transfiguration
department
something
miles
away
from
her
office
Come
think
could
probably
persuade
Peeves
met
him
the
way
was
mark
the
seriousness
the
situation
that
Hermione
made
objection
the
smashing
the
Transfiguration
department
she
said
her
brow
furrowed
she
continued
pace
Now

keep
students
right

from
her
office
while
force
entry
some
Slytherins
bound
and
tip
her
off
Luna
and

stand
either
end
the
corridor
said
Ginny
promptly
and
warn
people
not
down
there
because
someone
let
off
load
Garrotting
Gas
Hermione
looked
surprised
the
readiness
with
which
Ginny
had
come
with
this
lie
Ginny
shrugged
and
said
Fred
andGeorge
were
planning
before
they
left
said
Hermione
Well

Even

and

Harry

Hermione

and
loyalty

muttered
Right
well
even
all
that
don
think
going
able
bank
more
than
five
minutes
said
Hermione
looking
relieved
that
Harry
seemed
have
accepted
the
plan
not
with
Filch
and
the
wretched
Inquisitorial
Squad
floating
around
Five
minutes
enough
said
Harry
mon
let
Now
said
Hermione
looking
shocked

said
Harry
angrily
What

Hermione
Sirius
being
torturedright
now
all

she
said
desperately
You

Invisibility
Cloak
and
meet

the
end
Umbridge
corridor
Harry
didn
answer
but
flung
himself
out
the
room
and
began
fight
his
way
through
the
milling
crowds
outside
Two
floors
met
Seamus
and
Dean
who
hailed
him
jovially
and
told
him
they
were
planning
dusk
till
dawn
end
exams
celebration
the
common
room
Harry
barely
heard
them
scrambled
through
the
portrait
hole
while
they
were
still
arguing
about
how
many
black
market
Butterbeers
they
would
need
and
was
climbing
back
out
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
Sirius
knife
secure
his
bag
before
they
noticed
had
left
them
Harry
you

Galleons
Harold
Dingle
reckons
could
sell

Firewhisky
But
Harry
was
already
tearing
away
back
along
the
corridor
and
couple
minutes
later
was
jumping
the
last
few
stairs
join
Ron
Hermione
Ginny
and
Luna
who
were
huddled
together

end
Umbridge
corridor
Got

Harry
and
will

and
wait
until
the

Ron
strode
away
his
bright
red
hair
visible
right
the
end
the
passage
meanwhile
Ginny
equally
vivid
head
bobbed
between
the
jostling
students
surrounding
them
the

direction
trailed
Luna

Get

Hermione

and
pulling
him
back
into

Are

Harry
You

very
pale
fine
said
shortly
tugging
the
Invisibility
Cloak
from
out
his
bag
truth
his
scar
was
aching
but
not
badly
that
thought
Voldemort
had
yet
dealt
Sirius
fatal
blow
had
hurt
much
worse
than
this
when
Voldemort
had
been
punishing
Avery
Here
said
threw
the
Invisibility
Cloak
over
both
them
and
they
stood
listening
carefully
over
the
Latin
mumblings
the
bust
front
them
You
can
come
down
here
Ginny
was
calling
the
crowd
sorry
you
going
have
round
the
swivelling
staircase
someone
let
off
Garrotting
Gas
just
along
here
They
could
hear
people
complaining
one
surly
voice
said
can
see
gas
That
because
colourless
said
Ginny
convincingly
exasperated
voice
but
you
want
walk
through
carry
then
have
your
body
proof
for
the
next
idiot
who
doesn
believe
Slowly
the
crowd
thinned
The
news
about
the
Garrotting
Gas
seemed
have
spread
people
were
not
coming
this
way
any
more
When
last
the
surrounding
area
was
quite
clear
Hermione
said
quietly
think
that
good
going
get
Harry
come
let
They
moved
forwards
covered
the
Cloak
Luna
was
standing
with
her
back
them
the
far
end
the
corridor
they
passed
Ginny
Hermione
whispered
Good
one
don
forget
the
signal
What
the
signal
muttered
Harry
they
approached
Umbridge
door
loud
chorus
Weasley
our
King
they
see
Umbridge
coming
replied
Hermione
Harry
inserted
the
blade
Sirius
knife
the
crack
between
door
and
wall
The
lock
clicked
open
and
they
entered
the
office
The
garish
kittens
were
basking
the
late
afternoon
sunshine
that
was
warming
their
plates
but
otherwise
the
office
was
still
and
unoccupied
last
time
Hermione
breathed
sigh
relief
thought
she
might
have
added
extra
security
after
the
second
Niffler
They
pulled
off
the
Cloak
Hermione
hurried
over
the
window
and
stood
out
sight
peering
down
into
the
grounds
with
her
wand
out
Harry
dashed
over
the
fireplace
seized
the
pot
Floo
powder
and
threw
pinch
into
the
grate
causing
emerald
flames
burst
into
life
there
knelt
down
quickly
thrust
his
head
into
the
dancing
fire
and
cried
Number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
His
head
began
spin
though
had
just
got
off
air
ground
ride
though
his
knees
remained
firmly
planted
the
cold
office
floor
kept
his
eyes
screwed
against
the
whirling
ash
and
when
the
spinning
stopped
opened
them
find
himself
looking
out
the
long
cold
kitchen
Grimmauld
Place
There
was
nobody
there
had
expected
this
yet
was
not
prepared
for
the
molten
wave
dread
and
panic
that
seemed
burst
through
his
stomach
the
sight
the
deserted
room
Sirius
shouted
Sirius
are
you
there
His
voice
echoed
around
the
room
but
there
was
answer
except
tiny
scuffing
sound
the
right
the
fire
Who
there
called
wondering
whether
was
just
mouse
Kreacher
the
house
elf
crept
into
view
looked
highly
delighted
about
something
though
seemed
have
recently
sustained
nasty
injury
both
hands
which
were
heavily
bandaged
the
Potter
boy
head
the
fire
Kreacher
informed
the
empty
kitchen
stealing
furtive
oddly
triumphant
glances
Harry
What
has
come
for
Kreacher
wonders
Where
Sirius
Kreacher
Harry
demanded
The
house
elf
gave
wheezy
chuckle
Master
has
gone
out
Harry
Potter
Where
gone
Where
gone
Kreacher
Kreacher
merely
cackled
warning
you
said
Harry
fully
aware
that
his
scope
for
inflicting
punishment
upon
Kreacher
was
almost
non
existent
this
position
What
about
Lupin
Mad
Eye
Any
them
are
any
them
there
Nobody
here
but
Kreacher
said
the
elf
gleefully
and
turning
away
from
Harry
began
walk
slowly
towards
the
door
the
end
the
kitchen
Kreacher
thinks
will
have
little
chat
with
his
mistress
now
yes
hasn
had
chance
long
time
Kreacher
master
has
been
keeping
him
away
from
her
Where
has
Sirius
gone
Harry
yelled
after
the
elf
Kreacher
has
gone
the
Department
Mysteries
Kreacher
stopped
his
tracks
Harry
could
just
make
out
the
back
his
bald
head
through
the
forest
chair
legs
before
him
Master
does
not
tell
poor
Kreacher
where
going
said
the
elf
quietly
But
you
know
shouted
Harry
Don
you
You
know
where
There
was
moment
silence
then
the
elf
let
out
his
loudest
cackle
yet
Master
will
not
come
back
from
the
Department
Mysteries
said
gleefully
Kreacher
and
his
mistress
are
alone
again
And
scurried
forwards
and
disappeared
through
the
door
the
hall
You
But
before
could
utter
single
curse
insult
Harry
felt
great
pain
the
top
his
head
inhaled
lot
ash
and
choking
found
himself
being
dragged
backwards
through
the
flames
until
with
horrible
abruptness
was
staring
into
the
wide
pallid
face
Professor
Umbridge
who
had
dragged
him
backwards
out
the
fire
the
hair
and
was
now
bending
his
neck
back
far
would
though
she
were
going
slit
his
throat
You
think
she
whispered
bending
Harry
neck
back
even
further
that
was
looking
the
ceiling
that
after
two
Nifflers
was
going
let
one
more
foul
scavenging
little
creature
enter
office
without
knowledge
had
Stealth
Sensoring
Spells
placed
all
around
doorway
after
the
last
one
got
you
foolish
boy
Take
his
wand
she
barked
someone
could
not
see
and
felt
hand
grope
inside
thechest
pocket
his
robes
and
remove
the
wand
Hers
too
Harry
heard
scuffle
over
the
door
and
knew
that
Hermione
had
also
just
had
her
wand
wrested
from
her
want
know
why

said
Umbridge
shaking
the
fist
clutching
his
hair
that
staggered
was
trying
get
Firebolt
Harry
croaked
Liar
She
shook
his
head
again
Your
Firebolt

strict
guard

dungeons

well
know
Potter
You

your
head

With

Harry
trying
pull
away
from
her
felt

shouted
Umbridge
She
threw
him
from
her
and
slammed
into
the
desk
Now
could
see
Hermione
pinioned
against
the
wall
Millicent
Bulstrode
Malfoy
was
leaning
the
windowsill
smirking
threw
Harry
wand
into
the
air
one
handed
and
caught
again
There
was
commotion
outside
and
several
large
Slytherins
entered
each
gripping
Ron
Ginny
Luna
and
Harry
bewilderment
Neville
who
was
trapped
stranglehold
Crabbe
and
looked
imminent
danger
suffocation
All
four
them
had
been
gagged
Got

Ron
roughly

That

Ginny

was
trying

the
shins
the

him
along

Good

Umbridge
watching
Ginny
struggles
Well

Malfoy
laughed
loudly
and
sycophantically
Umbridge
gave
her
wide
complacent
smile
and
settled
herself
into
chintz
covered
armchair
blinking
her
captives
like
toad
flowerbed
Potter
she
said
You
stationed
lookouts
around
office
and
you
sent
this
buffoon
she
nodded
Ron
Malfoy
laughed
even
louder
tell
the
poltergeist
was
wreaking
havoc
the
Transfiguration

when
knew
perfectly
well
that
was
busy
smearing

the

all
the
school
telescopes
Filch
having
just
informed
Clearly
was
very
important
for
you
talk
somebody
Was
Albus
Dumbledore
the
half

Hagrid
doubt
was
Minerva
McGonagall
hear
she
still
too
ill
talk
anyone
Malfoy
and
few
the
other
members
the
Inquisitorial
Squad
laughed
some
more
that
Harry
found
was
full
rage
and
hatred
was
shaking
none
your
business
who
talk
snarled
Umbridge
slack
face
seemed
tighten
Very
well
she
said
her
most
dangerous
and
falsely
sweet
voice
Very
well
Potter
offered
you
the
chance
tell
freely
You
refused
have
alternative
but
force
you
Draco
fetch
Professor
Snape
Malfoy
stowed
Harry
wand
inside
his
robes
and
left
the
room
smirking
but
Harry
hardly
noticed
had
just
realised
something
could
not
believe
had
been
stupid
forget
had
thought
that
all
the
members
the
Order
all
those
who
could
help
him
save
Sirius
were
gone
but
had
been
wrong
There
was
still
member
the
Order
the
Phoenix
Hogwarts
Snape
There
was
silence
the
office
except
for
the
fidgetings
and
scuf
flings
resulting
from
the
Slytherins
efforts
keep
Ron
and
the
others
under

Umbridge

against

half

Ginny
was
still
trying
stamp
the
feet
the
sixth
year
girl
who
had
both
her
upper
arms
tight
grip
Neville
was
turning
steadily
more
purple
the
face
while
tugging
Crabbe
arms
and
Hermione
was
attempting
vain
throw
Millicent
Bulstrode
off
her
Luna
however
stood
limply
the
side
her
captor
gazing
vaguely
out
the
window
though
rather
bored
the
proceedings
Harry
looked
back
Umbridge
who
was
watching
him
closely
kept
his
face
deliberately
smooth
and
blank
footsteps
were
heard
the
corridor
outside
and
Draco
Malfoy
entered
the
room
closely
followed
Snape
You
wanted
see
Headmistress
said
Snape
looking
around
all
the
pairs
struggling
students
with
expression
complete
indifference
Professor
Snape
said
Umbridge
smiling
widely
and
standing
again
Yes
would
like
another
bottle
Veritaserum
quick
you
can
please
You
took
last
bottle
interrogate
Potter
said
surveying
her
coolly
through
his
greasy
curtains
black
hair
Surely
you
did
not
use
all
told
you
that
three
drops
would
sufficient
Umbridge
flushed
You
can
make
some
more
can
you
she
said
her
voice
becoming
more
sweetly
girlish
always
did
when
she
was
furious
Certainly
said
Snape
his

curling

for
you
around

squawked
Umbridge
swelling
toadishly
Amonth
But
need
this
evening
Snape
have
just
found
Potter
using
fire
communicate
with
person
persons
unknown
Really
said
Snape
showing
his
first
faint
sign
interest
looked
round
Harry
Well
doesn
surprise
Potter
has
never
shown
much
inclination
follow
school
rules
His
cold
dark
eyes
were
boring
into
Harry
who
met
his
gaze
unflinchingly
concentrating
hard
what
had
seen
his
dream
willing
Snape
read
his
mind
understand
wish
interrogate
him
repeated
Umbridge
angrily
and
Snape
looked
away
from
Harry
back
into
her
furiously
quivering
face
wish
you
provide
with
potion
that
will
force
him
tell
the
truth
have
already
told
you
said
Snape
smoothly
that
have
further
stocks
Veritaserum
Unless
you
wish
poison
Potter
and
assure
you
would
have
the
greatest
sympathy
with
you
you
did
cannot
help
you
The
only
trouble
that
most
venoms
act
too
fast
give
the
victim
much
time
for
truth
telling
Snape
looked
back
Harry
who
stared
him
frantic
communicate
without
words
Voldemort
got
Sirius
the
Department
Mysteries
thought
desperately
Voldemort
got
Sirius
You
are
probation
shrieked
Professor
Umbridge
and
Snape
looked
back
her
his
eyebrows
slightly
raised
You
are
being
deliberately
unhelpful
expected
better
Lucius
Malfoy
always
speaks
most
highly
you
Now
get
out
office
Snape
gave
her
ironic
bow
and
turned
leave
Harry
knew
his
last
chance
letting
the
Order
know
what
was
going
was
walking
out
the
door
got
Padfoot
shouted
got
Padfoot
the
place
where

Snape
had

Padfoot
cried
Professor
Umbridge
looking
eagerly
from
Harry
Snape
What
Padfoot
Where
what
hidden
What
does
mean
Snape
Snape
looked
round
Harry
His
face
was
inscrutable
Harry
could
not
tell
whether
had
understood
not
but
did
not
dare
speak
more
plainly
front
Umbridge
have
idea
said
Snape
coldly
Potter
when
want
nonsense
shouted
shall
give
you
Babbling
Beverage
And
Crabbe
loosen
your
hold
little
Longbottom
suffocates
will
mean

tedious
paperwork
and
afraid
shall
have
mention
your
reference
ever
you
apply
for

closed
the
door
behind
him
with
snap
leaving
Harry
state
worse
turmoil
than
before
Snape
had
been
his
very
last
hope
looked
Umbridge
who
seemed
feeling
the
same
way
her
chest
was
heaving
with
rage
and
frustration
Very
well
she
said
and
she
pulled
out
her
wand
Very
well
left
with
alternative
this
more
than
matter
school
discipline
this
issue
Ministry
security
yes
yes
She
seemed
talking
herself
into
something
She
was
shifting
her
weight
nervously
from
foot
foot
staring
Harry
beating
her
wand
against
her
empty
palm
and
breathing
heavily
watched
her
Harry
felt
horribly
powerless
without
his
own
wand
You
are
forcing
Potter
not
want
said
Umbridge
still
moving
restlessly
the
spot
but
sometimes
circumstances
justify
the
use
sure
the
Minister
will
understand
that
had
choice
Malfoy
was
watching
her
with
hungry
expression
his
face
The
Cruciatus
Curse
ought
loosen
your
tongue
said
Umbridge
quietly
shrieked
Hermione
Professor
Umbridge
illegal
But
Umbridge
took
notice
There
was
nasty
eager
excited
look
her
face
that
Harry
had
never
seen
before
She
raised
her
wand
The
Minister
wouldn
want
you
break
the
law
Professor
Umbridge
cried
Hermione
What
Cornelius
doesn
know
won
hurt
him
said
Umbridge
who
was
now
panting
slightly
she
pointed
her
wand
different
parts
Harry
body
turn
apparently
trying
decide
where
would
hurt
most
never
knew
ordered
Dementors
after
Potter
last
summer
but
was
delighted
given
the
chance
expel
him
all
the
same
was
you
gasped
Harry
You
sent
the
Dementors
after
Somebody
had
act
breathed
Umbridge
her
wand
came
rest
pointing
directly
Harry
forehead
They
were
all
bleating
about
silencing
you
somehow
discrediting
you
but
was
the
one
who
actually
did
something
about
only
you
wriggled
out
that
one
didn
you
Potter
Nottoday
though
notnow
And
taking
deep
breath
she
cried
Cruc
shouted
Hermione
cracked
voice
from
behind
Millicent
Bulstrode
Harry
have
tell
her
way
yelled
Harry
staring
the
little
Hermione
could
see
have
Harry
she
force
out
you
anyway
what
what
the
point
And
Hermione
began
cry
weakly
into
the
back
Millicent
Bulstrode
robes
Millicent
stopped
trying
squash
her
against
the
wall
immediately
and
dodged
out
her
way
looking
disgusted
Well
well
well
said
Umbridge
looking
triumphant
Little
Miss
Question
all
going
give
some
answers
Come
then
girl
come
nee
shouted
Ron
through
his
gag
Ginny
was
staring
Hermione
though
she
had
never
seen
her
before
Neville
still
choking
for
breath
was
gazing
her
too
But
Harry
had
just
noticed
something
Though
Hermione
was
sobbing
desperately
into
her
hands
there
was
trace
tear
sorry
everyone
said
Hermione
But
can
stand
That
right
that
right
girl
said
Umbridge
seizing
Hermione
the
shoulders
thrusting
her
into
the
abandoned
chintz
chair
and
leaning
over
her
Now
then
with
whom
was
Potter
communicating
just
now
Well
gulped
Hermione
into
her
hands
well
wastrying
speak
Professor
Dumbledore
Ron
froze
his
eyes
wide
Ginny
stopped
trying
stamp
her
Slytherin
captor
toes
and
even
Luna
looked
mildly
surprised
Fortunately
the
attention
Umbridge
and
her
minions
was
focused
too
exclusively
upon
Hermione
notice
these
suspicious
signs
Dumbledore
said
Umbridge
eagerly
You
know
where
Dumbledore
then
Well
sobbed
Hermione
tried
the
Leaky
Cauldron
Diagon
Alley
and
the
Three
Broomsticks
and
even
the
Hog
Head
Idiot
girl
Dumbledore
won
sitting
pub
when
the
whole
Ministry
looking
lor
him
shouted
Umbridge
disappointment
etched
every
sagging
line
her
face
But
but
needed
tell
him
something
important
wailed
Hermione
holding
her
hands
more
tightly
over
her
face
not
Harry
knew
out
anguish
but
disguise
the
continued
absence
tears
Yes
said
Umbridge
with
sudden
resurgence
excitement
What
was
you
wanted
tell
him
wanted
tell
him
ready
choked
Hermione
What
ready
demanded
Umbridge
and
now
she
grabbed
Hermione
shoulders
again
and
shook
her
slightly
What
ready
girl
The
the
weapon
said
Hermione
Weapon
Weapon
said
Umbridge
and
her
eyes
seemed
pop
with
excitement
You
have
been
developing
some
method
resistance
weapon
you
could
use
against
the
Ministry
Professor
Dumbledore
orders
course
yes
gasped
Hermione
but
had
leave
before
was
finished
and
now
finished
for
him
and
can
find
him
tell
him
What
kind
weapon
said
Umbridge
harshly
her
stubby
hands
still
tight
Hermione
shoulders
don
really
understand
said
Hermione
sniffing
loudly
just
did
what
Professor
Dumbledore
told
Umbridge
straightened
looking
exultant
Lead
the
weapon
she
said
not
showing
them
said
Hermione
shrilly
looking
around
the
Slytherins
through
her
fingers
not
for
you
set
conditions
said
Professor
Umbridge
harshly
Fine
said
Hermione
now
sobbing
into
her
hands
again
Fine
let
them
see
hope
they
use
you
fact
wish
you
invite
loads
and
loads
people
come
and
see
that
would
serve
you
right
love
the
whole
school
knew
where
was
and
how
use
and
then
you
annoy
any
them
they
able
sort
you
out
These
words
had
powerful
impact
Umbridge
she
glanced
swiftly
and
suspiciously
around
her
Inquisitorial
Squad
her
bulging
eyes
resting
for
moment
Malfoy
who
was
too
slow
disguise
the
look
eagerness
and
greed
that
had
appeared
his
face
Umbridge
contemplated
Hermione
for
another
long
moment
then
spoke
what
she
clearly
thought
was
motherly
voice
All
right
dear
let
make
just
you
and
and
take
Potter
too
shall
Get
now
Professor
said
Malfoy
eagerly
Professor
Umbridge
think
some
the
Squad
should
come
with
you
look
after
fully
qualified
Ministry
official
Malfoy
you
really
think
cannot
manage
two
wandless
teenagers
alone
asked
Umbridge
sharply
any
case
does
not
sound
though
this
weapon
something
that
schoolchildren
should
see
You
will
remain
here
until
return
and
make
sure
none
these
she
gestured
around
Ron
Ginny
Neville
and
Luna
escape
All
right
said
Malfoy
looking
sulky
and
disappointed
And
you
two
can
ahead
and
show
the
way
said
Umbridge
pointing
Harry
and
Hermione
with
her
wand
Lead
FIGHT
AND
FLIGHT
Harry
had
idea
what
Hermione
was
planning
even
whether
she
had
plan
walked
half
pace
behind
her
they
headed
down
the
corridor
outside
Umbridge
office
knowing
would
look
very
suspicious
appeared
not
know
where
they
were
going
did
not
dare
attempt
talk
her
Umbridge
was
walking
closely
behind
them
that
could
hear
her
ragged
breathing
Hermione
led
the
way
down
the
stairs
into
the
Entrance
Hall
The
din
loud
voices
and
the
clatter
cutlery
plates
echoed
from
out
the
double
doors
the
Great
Hall
seemed
incredible
Harry
that
twenty
feet
away
were
people
who
were
enjoying
dinner
celebrating
the
end
exams
not
care
the
world
Hermione
walked
straight
out
the
oak
front
doors
and
down
the
stone
steps
into
the
balmy
evening
air
The
sun
was
falling
towards
the
tops
the
trees
the
Forbidden
Forest
now
and
Hermione
marched
purposefully
across
the
grass
Umbridge
jogging
keep
their
long
dark
shadows
rippled
over
the
grass
behind
them
like
cloaks
hidden
Hagrid
hut
said
Umbridge
eagerly
Harry
ear
course
not
said
Hermione
scathingly
Hagrid
might
have
set
off
accidentally
Yes
said
Umbridge
whose
excitement
seemed
mounting
Yes
would
have
done
course
the
great
half
breed
oaf
She
laughed
Harry
felt
strong
urge
swing
round
and
seize
her
the
throat
but
resisted
His
scar
was
throbbing
the
soft
evening
air
but
had
not
yet
burned
white
hot
knew
would
Voldemort
had
moved
for
the
kill
Then
where
asked
Umbridge
with
hint
uncertainty
her
voice
Hermione
continued
stride
towards
the
Forest
there
course
said
Hermione
pointing
into
the
dark
trees
had
somewhere
that
students
weren
going
find
accidentally
didn
course
said
Umbridge
though
she
sounded
little
apprehensive
now
course
very
well
then
you
two
stay
ahead
Can
have
your
wand
then
going
first
Harry
asked
her
don
think
Potter
said
Umbridge
sweetly
poking
him
the
back
with
The
Ministry
places
rather
higher
value
life
than
yours
afraid
they
reached
the
cool
shade
the
first
trees
Harry
tried
catch
Hermione
eye
walking
into
the
Forest
without
wands
seemed
him
more
foolhardy
than
anything
they
had
done
far
this
evening
She
however
merely
gave
Umbridge
contemptuous
glance
and
plunged
straight
into
the
trees
moving
such
pace
that
Umbridge
with
her
shorter
legs
had
difficulty
keeping
very
far
Umbridge
asked
her
robe
ripped
bramble
yes
said
Hermione
yes
well
hidden
Harry
misgivings
increased
Hermione
was
not
taking
the
path
they
had
followed
visit
Grawp
but
the
one
followed
three
years
ago
the
lair
the
monster
Aragog
Hermione
had
not
been
with
him
that
occasion
doubted
she
had
any
idea
what
danger
lay
the
end
are
you
sure
this
the
right
way
asked
her
pointedly
yes
she
said
steely
voice
crashing
through
the
undergrowth
with
what
thought
was
wholly
unnecessary
amount
noise
Behind
them
Umbridge
tripped
over
fallen
sapling
Neither
them
paused
help
her
again
Hermione
merely
strode
calling
loudly
over
her
shoulder
bit
further
Hermione
keep
your
voice
down
Harry
muttered
hurrying
catch
with
her
Anything
could
listening
here
want
heard
she
answered
quietly
Umbridge
jogged
noisily
after
them
You
see
They
walked
for
what
seemed
long
time
until
they
were
once
again
deep
into
the
Forest
that
the
dense
tree
canopy
blocked
out
all
light
Harry
had
the
feeling
had
had
before
the
Forest
one
being
watched
unseen
eyes
How
much
further
demanded
Umbridge
angrily
from
behind
him
Not
far
now
shouted
Hermione
they
emerged
into
dim
dank
clearing
Just
little
bit
arrow
flew
through
the
air
and
landed
with
menacing
thud
the
tree
just
over
her
head
The
air
was
suddenly
full
the
sound
hooves
Harry
could
feel
the
Forest
floor
trembling
Umbridge
gave
little
scream
and
pushed
him
front
her
like
shield
wrenched
himself
free
her
and
turned
Around
fifty
centaurs
were
emerging
every
side
their
bows
raised
and
loaded
pointing
Harry
Hermione
and
Umbridge
They
backed
slowly
into
the
centre
the
clearing
Umbridge
uttering
odd
little
whimpers
terror
Harry
looked
sideways
Hermione
She
was
wearing
triumphant
smile
Who
are
you
said
voice
Harry
looked
left
The
chestnut
bodied
centaur
called
Magorian
was
walking
towards
them
out
the
circle
his
bow
like
those
the
others
was
raised
Harry
right
Umbridge
was
still
whimpering
her
wand
trembling
violently
she
pointed
the
advancing
centaur
asked
you
who
are
you
human
said
Magorian
roughly
Dolores
Umbridge
said
Umbridge
high
pitched
terrified
voice
Senior
Undersecretary
the
Minister
for
Magic
and
Headmistress
and
High
Inquisitor
Hogwarts
You
are
from
the
Ministry
Magic
said
Magorian
many
the
centaurs
the
surrounding
circle
shifted
restlessly
That
right
said
Umbridge
even
higher
voice
very
careful
the
laws
laid
down
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
Magical
Creatures
any
attack
half
breeds
such
yourselves
human
What
did
you
call
shouted
wild
looking
black
centaur
whom
Harry
recognised
Bane
There

and

Don

Hermione
said
furiously
but
Umbridge
did
not
appear

heard
her
Still
pointing
her
shaking
wand
Magorian
she
continued
Law
Fifteen

the

grey
centaur
Harry
and
Hermione
had
seen
their
last
trip
into
the
Forest
Why
are
you
here
Your
Forest
said
Umbridge
shaking
now
not
only
with
fright
but
also
seemed
with
indignation
would
remind
you
that
you
live

that
caught
her
mousy

passing
she
let
out

splitting
scream
and
threw
her
hands
over
her
head
while
some
the
centaurs
bellowed
their
approval
and
others
laughed
raucously
The
sound
their
wild
neighing
laughter
echoing
around
the
dimly
lit
clearing
and
the
sight
their
pawing
hooves
was
extremely
unnerving
Whose

Bane
Filthy
half

screamed
her
hands
still
tight
over
her
head
Beasts
Uncontrolled
animals
quiet
shouted
Hermione
but
was
too
late
Umbridge
pointed
her
wand
Magorian
and
screamed
Incarcerous
Ropes
flew
out
midair
like
thick
snakes
wrapping
themselves
tightly
around
the
centaur
torso
and
trapping
his
arms
gave
cry
rage
and
reared
his
hind
legs
attempting
free
himself
while
the
other
centaurs
charged
Harry
grabbed
Hermione
and
pulled
her
the
ground
face
down
the
Forest
floor
knew
moment
terror
hooves
thundered
around
him
but
the
centaurs
leapt
over
and
around
them
bellowing
and
screaming
with
rage
Nooooo
heard
Umbridge
shriek
Noooooo
Senior
Undersecretary
you
cannot
Unhand
you
animals
nooooo
Harry
saw
flash
red
light
and
knew
she
had
attempted
Stun
one
them
then
she
screamed
very
loudly
Lifting
his
head
few
inches
Harry
saw
that
Umbridge
had
been
seized
from
behind
Bane
and
lifted
high
into
the
air
wriggling
and
yelling
with
fright
Her
wand
fell
from
her
hand
the
ground
and
Harry
heart
leapt
could
just
reach
But
stretched
out
hand
towards
centaur
hoof
descended
upon
the
wand
and
broke
cleanly
half
Now
roared
voice
Harry
ear
and
thick
hairy
arm
descended
from
thin
air
and
dragged
him
upright
Hermione
too
had
been
pulled
her
feet
Over
the
plunging
many
coloured
backs
and
heads
the
centaurs
Harry
saw
Umbridge
being
borne
away
through
the
trees
Bane
Screaming
non
stop
her
voice
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
they
could
longer
hear
over
the
trampling
hooves
surrounding
them
And
these
said
the
hard
faced
grey
centaur
holding
Hermione
They
are
young
said
slow
doleful
voice
from
behind
Harry
not
attack
foals
They
brought
her
here
Ronan
replied
the
centaur
who
had
such
firm
grip
Harry
And
they
are
not
young
nearing
manhood
this
one
shook
Harry
the
neck
his
robes
Please
said
Hermione
breathlessly
please
don
attack
don
think
like
her
aren
Ministry
Magic
employees
only
came
here
because
hoped
you
drive
her
off
for
Harry
knew
once
from
the
look
the
face
the
grey
centaur
holding
Hermione
that
she
had
made
terrible
mistake
saying
this
The
grey
centaur
threw
back
his
head
his
back
legs
stamping
furiously
and
bellowed
You
see
Ronan
They
already
have
the
arrogance
their
kind
were
your
dirty
work
were
human
girl
were
act
your
servants
drive
away
your
enemies
like
obedient
hounds
said
Hermione
horrorstruck
squeak
Please
didn
mean
that
just
hoped
you
able
help
But
she
seemed
going
from
bad
worse
not
help
humans
snarled
the
centaur
holding
Harry
tightening
his
grip
and
rearing
little
the
same
time
that
Harry
feet
left
the
ground
momentarily
are
race
apart
and
proud
will
not
permit
you
walk
from
here
boasting
that
did
your
bidding
not
going
say
anything
like
that
Harry
shouted
know
you
didn
what
you
did
because
wanted
you
But
nobody
seemed
listening
him

towards
the
back
the
crowd
shouted
They
came
here
unasked
they

these

and
dun

shouted
They

You
said
you

the
innocent
shouted
Hermione

sliding
down
her
face
now

you
haven
used

please
let
back
are
not
all
like
the
traitor
Firenze
human

shouted
the
grey
centaur
more
neighing
roars
approval
from
his
fellows
Perhaps
you
thought
pretty
talking
horses
are
ancient
people
who
will
not
stand
wizard
invasions
and
insults
not
recognise
your
laws
not
acknowledge
your
superiority
are
But
they
did
not
hear
what
else
centaurs
were
for
that
moment
there
came
crashing
noise
the
edge
the
clearing
loud
that
all
them
Harry
Hermione
and
the
filty
centaurs
filling
the
clearing
looked
around
Harry
centaur
let
him
fall
the
ground
again
his
hands
flew
his
bow
and
quiver
arrows
Hermione
had
been
dropped
too
and
Harry
hurried
towards
her
two
thick
tree
trunks
parted
ominously
and
the
monstrous
form
Grawp
the
giant
appeared
the
gap
The
centaurs
nearest
him
backed
into
those
behind
the
clearing
was
now
forest
bows
and
arrows
waiting
fired
all
pointing
upwards
the
enormous
greyish
face
now
looming
over
them
from
just
beneath
the
thick
canopy
branches
Grawp
lopsided
mouth
was
gaping
stupidly
they
could
see
his
bricklike
yellow
teeth
glimmering
the
half
light
his
dull
sludge
coloured
eyes
narrowed
squinted
down
the
creatures
his
feet
Broken
ropes
trailed
from
both
ankles
opened
his
mouth
even
wider
Hagger
Harry
did
not
know
what
hagger
meant
what
language
was
from
nor
did
much
care
was
watching
Grawp
feet
which
were
almost
long
Harry
whole
body
Hermione
gripped
his
arm
tightly
the
centaurs
were
quite
silent
staring
the
giant
whose
huge
round
head
moved
from
side
side
continued
peer
amongst
them
though
looking
for
something
had
dropped
Hagger
said
again
more
insistently
Get
away
from
here
giant
called
Magorian
You
are
not
welcome
among
These
words
seemed
make
impression
whatsoever
Grawp
stooped
little
the
centaurs
arms
tensed
their
bows
then
bellowed
HAGGER
few
the
centaurs
looked
worried
now
Hermione
however
gave
gasp
Harry
she
whispered
think
trying
say
Hagrid
this
precise
moment
Grawp
caught
sight
them
the
only
two
humans
sea
centaurs
lowered
his
head
another
foot
staring
intently
them
Harry
could
feel
Hermione
shaking
Grawp
opened
his
mouth
wide
again
and
said
deep
rumbling
voice
Hermy
Goodness
said
Hermione
gripping
Harry
arm
tightly
was
growing
numb
and
looking
though
she
was
about
faint
remembered
HERMY
roared
Grawp
WHERE
HAGGER
don
know
squealed
Hermione
terrified
sorry
Grawp
don
know
GRAWP
WANT
HAGGER
One
the
giant
massive
hands
reached
down
Hermione
let
out
real
scream
ran
few
steps
backwards
and
fell
over
Devoid
wand
Harry
braced
himself
punch
kick
bite
whatever
else
took
the
hand
swooped
towards
him
and
knocked
snow
white
centaur
off
his
legs
was
what
the
centaurs
had
been
waiting
for
Grawp
outstretched
fingers
were
foot
from
Harry
when
fifty
arrows
soared
through
the
air
the
giant
peppering
his
enormous
face
causing
him
howl
with
pain
and
rage
and
straighten
rubbing
his
face
with
his
enormous
hands
breaking
off
the
arrow
shafts
but
forcing
the
arrowheads
still
deeper
yelled
and
stamped
his
enormous
feet
and
the
centaurs
scattered
out
the
way
pebble
sized
droplets
Grawp
blood
showered
Harry
pulled
Hermione
her
feet
and
the
pair
them
ran
fast
they
could
for
the
shelter
the
trees
Once
there
they
looked
back
Grawp
was
snatching
blindly
the
centaurs
blood
ran
down
his
face
they
were
retreating
disorder
galloping
away
through
the
trees
the
other
side
the
clearing
Harry
and
Hermione
watched
Grawp
give
another
roar
fury
and
plunge
after
them
smashing
more
trees
aside
went
said
Hermione
quaking
badly
that
her
knees
gave
way
that
was
horrible
And
might
kill
them
all
not
that
fussed
honest
said
Harry
bitterly
The
sounds
the
galloping
centaurs
and
the
blundering
giant
grew
fainter
and
fainter
Harry
listened
them
his
scar
gave
another
great
throb
and
wave
terror
swept
over
him
They
had
wasted
much
time
they
were
even
further
from
rescuing
Sirius
than
they
had
been
when
had
had
the
vision
Not
only
had
Harry
managed
lose
his
wand
but
they
were
stuck
the
middle
the
Forbidden
Forest
with
means
transport
whatsoever
Smart
plan
spat
Hermione
having
release
some
his
fury
Really
smart
plan
Where
from
here
need
get
back
the
castle
said
Hermione
faintly
the
time
done
that
Sirius
probably
dead
said
Harry
kicking
nearby
tree
temper
high
pitched
chattering
started
overhead
and
looked
see
angry
Bowtruckle
flexing
its
long
twiglike
fingers
him
Well
can
anything
without
wands
said
Hermione
hopelessly
dragging
herself
again
Anyway
Harry
how
exactly
were
you
planning
get
all
the
way
London
Yeah
were
just
wondering
that
said
familiar
voice
from
behind
her
Harry
and
Hermione
moved
together
instinctively
and
peered
through
the
trees
Ron
came
into
sight
closely
followed
Ginny
Neville
and
Luna
All
them
looked
little
the
worse
for
wear
there
were
several
long
scratches
running
the
length
Ginny
cheek
large
purple
lump
was
swelling
above
Neville
right
eye
Ron
lip
was
bleeding
worse
than
ever
but
all
were
looking
rather
pleased
with
themselves
said
Ron
pushing
aside
low
hanging
branch
and
holding
out
Harry
wand
had
any
ideas
How
did
you
get
away
asked
Harry
amazement
taking
his
wand
from
Ron
Couple
Stunners
Disarming
Charm
Neville
brought
off
really
nice
little
Impediment
Jinx
said
Ron
airily
now
handing
back
Hermione
wand
too
But
Ginny
was
best
she
got
Malfoy
Bat
Bogey
Hex
was
superb
his
whole
face
was
covered
the
great
flapping
things
Anyway
wesaw
you
out
the
window
heading
into
the
Forest
and
followed
What
you
done
with
Umbridge
She
got
carried
away
said
Harry
herd
centaurs
And
they
left
you
behind
asked
Ginny
looking
astonished
they
got
chased
off
Grawp
said
Harry
Who
Grawp
Luna
asked
interestedly
Hagrid
little
brother
said
Ron
promptly
Anyway
never
mind
that
now
Harry
what
did
you
find
out
the
fire
Has
You
Know
Who
got
Sirius
Yes
said
Harry
his
scar
gave
another
painful
prickle
and
sure
Sirius
still
alive
but
can
see
how
going
get
there
help
him
They
all
fell
silent
looking
rather
scared
the
problem
facing
them
seemed
insurmountable
Well
have
fly
won
said
Luna
the
closest
thing
matter
fact
voice
Harry
had
ever
heard
her
use
said
Harry
irritably
rounding
her
First
all
aren
doing
anything
you
including
yourself
that
and
second
all
Ron
the
only
one
with
broomstick
that
isn
being
guarded
security
troll
got
broom
said
Ginny
Yeah
but
you
not
coming
said
Ron
angrily
Excuse
but
care
what
happens
Sirius
much
you
said
Ginny
her
jaw
set
that
her
resemblance
Fred
and
George
was
suddenly
striking
You
too
Harry
began
but
Ginny
said
fiercely
three
years
older
than
you
were
when
you
fought
You
Know
Who
over
the
Philosopher
Stone
and
because
that
Malfoy
stuck
back
Umbridge
office
with
giant
flying
bogies
attacking
him
Yeah
but
were
all
the
together
said
Neville
quietly
was
all
supposed
about
fighting
You
Know
Who
wasn
And
this
the
first
chance
had
something
real
was
that
all
just
game
something
course
wasn
said
Harry
impatiently
Then
should
come
too
said
Neville
simply
want
help
That
right
said
Luna
smiling
happily
Harry
eyes
met
Ron
knew
Ron
was
thinking
exactly
what
was
could
have
chosen
any
members
the
addition
himself
Ron
and
Hermione
join
him
the
attempt
rescue
Sirius
would
not
have
picked
Ginny
Neville
Luna
Well
doesn
matter
anyway
said
Harry
through
gritted
teeth
because
still
don
know
how
get
there
thought
settled
that
said
Luna
maddeningly
flying
Look
said
Ron
barely
containing
his
anger
you
might
able
fly
without
broomstick
but
the
rest
can
sprout
wings
whenever
There
are
ways
flying
other
than
with
broomsticks
said
Luna
serenely
pose
going
ride
the
back
the
Kacky
Snorgle
whatever
Ron
demanded
The
Crumple
Horned
Snorkack
can
fly
said
Luna
dignified
voice
butthey
can
and
Hagrid
says
they
very
good
finding
places
their
riders
are
looking
for
Harry
whirled
round
Standing
between
two
trees
their
white
eyes
gleaming
eerily
were
two
Thestrals
watching
the
whispered
conversation
though
they
understood
every
word
Yes
whispered
moving
towards
them
They
tossed
their
reptilian
heads
throwing
back
long
black
manes
and
Harry
stretched
out
his
hand
eagerly
and
patted
the
nearest
one
shining
neck
how
could
ever
have
thought
them
ugly
those
mad
horse
things
said
Ron
uncertainly
staring
point
slightly
the
left
the
Thestral
Harry
was
patting
Those
ones
you
can
see
unless
you
watched
someone
snuff
Yeah
said
Harry
How
many
Just
two
Well
need
three
said
Hermione
who
was
still
looking
little
shaken
but
determined
just
the
same
Four
Hermione
said
Ginny
scowling
think
there
are
six
actually
said
Luna
calmly
counting
Don
stupid
can
all
said
Harry
angrily
Look
you
three
pointed
Neville
Ginny
and
Luna
you
not
involved
this
you
not
They
burst
into
more
protests
His
scar
gave
another
more
painful
twinge
Every
moment
they
delayed
was
precious
did
not
have
time
argue
fine
your
choice
said
curtly
but
unless
can
find
more
Thestrals
you
not
going
able
more
them
will
come
said
Ginny
confidently
who
like
Ron
was
squinting
quite
the
wrong
direction
apparently
under
the
impression
that
she
was
looking
the
horses
What
makes
you
think
that
Because
case
you
hadn
noticed
you
and
Hermione
are
both
covered
blood
she
said
coolly
and
know
Hagrid
lures
Thestrals
with
raw
meat
That
probably
why
these
two
turned
the
first
place
Harry
felt
soft
tug
his
robes
that
moment
and
looked
down
see
the
closest
Thestral
licking
his
sleeve
which
was
damp
with
Grawp
blood
then
said
bright
idea
occurring
Ron
and
will
take
these
two
and
ahead
and
Hermione
can
stay
here
with
you
three
and
she
attract
more
Thestrals
not
staying
behind
said
Hermione
furiously
There
need
said
Luna
smiling
Look
here
come
more
now
you
two
must
really
smell
Harry
turned
fewer
than
six
seven
Thestrals
were
picking
their
way
through
the
trees
their
great
leathery
wings
folded
tight
their
bodies
their
eyes
gleaming
through
the
darkness
had
excuse
now
All
right
said
angrily
pick
one
and
get
then
THE
DEPARTMENT
MYSTERIES
Harry
wound
his
hand
tightly
into
the
mane
the
nearest
Thestral
placed
foot
stump
nearby
and
scrambled
clumsily
the
horses
silken
back
did
not
object
but
twisted
its
head
around
fangs
bared
and
attempted
continue
its
eager
licking
his
robes
found
there
was
way
lodging
his
knees
behind
the
wing
joints
that
made
him
feel
more
secure
then
looked
around
the
others
Neville
had
heaved
himself
over
the
back
the
next
Thestral
and
was
now
attempting
swing
one
short
leg
over
the
creature
back
Luna
was
already
place
sitting
side
saddle
and
adjusting
her
robes
though
she
did
this
every
day
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
however
were
still
standing
motionless
the
spot
open
mouthed
and
staring
What
said
How
supposed
get
said
Ron
faintly
When
can
see
the
things
easy
said
Luna
sliding
obligingly
from
her
Thestral
and
marching
over
him
Hermione
and
Ginny
Come
here
She
pulled
them
over
the
other
Thestrals
standing
around
and
one
one
managed
help
them
the
back
their
mount
All
three
looked
extremely
nervous
she
wound
their
hands
into
their
horses
mane
and
told
them
grip
tightly
before
she
got
back
her
own
steed
This
mad
Ron
murmured
moving
his
free
hand
gingerly
and
down
his
horse
neck
Mad
could
just
see
You
better
hope
stays
invisible
said
Harry
darkly
all
ready
then
They
all
nodded
and
saw
five
pairs
knees
tighten
beneath
their
robes
looked
down
the
back
his
Thestral
glossy
black
head
and
swallowed
Ministry
Magic
visitors
entrance
London
then
said
uncertainly
you
know
where
For
moment
Harry
Thestral
did
nothing
all
then
with
sweeping
movement
that
nearly
unseated
him
the
wings
either
side
extended
the
horse
crouched
slowly
then
rocketed
upwards
fast
and
steeply
that
Harry
had
clench
his
arms
and
legs
tightly
around
the
horse
avoid
sliding
backwards
over
its
bony
rump
closed
his
eyes
and
pressed
his
face
down
into
the
horse
silky
mane
they
burst
through
the
topmost
branches
the
trees
and
soared
out
into
blood
red
sunset
Harry
did
not
think
had
ever
moved
fast
the
Thestral
streaked
over
the
castle
its
wide
wings
hardly
beating
the
cooling
air
was
slapping
Harry
face
eyes
screwed
against
the
rushing
wind
looked
round
and
saw
his
five
fellows
soaring
along
behind
him
each
them
bent
low
possible
into
the
neck
their
Thestral
protect
themselves
from
his
slipstream
They
were
over
the
Hogwarts
grounds
they
had
passed
Hogsmeade
Harry
could
see
mountains
and
gullies
below
them
the
daylight
began
fail
Harry
saw
small
collections
lights
they
passed
over
more
villages
then
winding
road
which
single
car
was
beetling
its
way
home
through
the
hills
This
bizarre
Harry
barely
heard
Ron
yell
from
somewhere
behind
him
and
imagined
how
must
feel
speeding
along
this
height
with
visible
means
support
Twilight
fell
the
sky
was
turning
light
dusky
purple
littered
with
tiny
silver
stars
and
soon
only
the
lights
Muggle
towns
gave
them
any
clue
how
far
from
the
ground
they
were
how
very
fast
they
were
travelling
Harry
arms
were
wrapped
tightly
around
his
horse
neck
willed
even
faster
How
much
time
had
elapsed
since
had
seen
Sirius
lying
the
Department
Mysteries
floor
How
much
longer
would
Sirius
able
resist
Voldemort
All
Harry
knew
for
sure
was
that
his
godfather
had
neither
done
Voldemort
wanted
nor
died
for
was
convinced
that
either
outcome
would
have
caused
him
feel
Voldemort
jubilation
fury
course
through
his
own
body
making
his
scar
sear
painfully
had
the
night
Weasley
was
attacked
they
flew
through
the
gathering
darkness
Harry
face
felt
stiff
and
cold
his
legs
numb
from
gripping
the
Thestrals
sides
tightly
but
did
not
dare
shift
his
position
lest
slip
was
deaf
from
the
thundering
rush
air
his
ears
and
his
mouth
was
dry
and
frozen
from
the
cold
night
wind
had
lost
all
sense
how
far
theyhad
come
all
his
faith
was
the
beast
beneath
him
still
streaking
purposefully
through
the
night
barely
flapping
its
wings
sped
ever
onwards
they
were
too
late
still
alive
still
fighting
can
feel
Voldemort
decided
Sirius
was
not
going
crack
know
Harry
stomach
gave
jolt
the
Thestrals
head
was
suddenly
pointing
towards
the
ground
and
actually
slid
forwards
few
inches
along
its
neck
They
were
descending
last
thought
heard
shriek
behind
him
and
twisted
around
dangerously
but
could
see
sign
falling
body
presumably
they
had
all
received
shock
from
the
change
direction
just
had
And
now
bright
orange
lights
were
growing
larger
and
rounder
all
sides
they
could
see
the
tops
buildings
streams
headlights
like
luminous
insect
eyes
squares
pale
yellow
that
were
windows
Quite
suddenly
seemed
they
were
hurtling
towards
the
pavement
Harry
gripped
the
Thestral
with
every
last
ounce
his
strength
braced
for
sudden
impact
but
the
horse
touched
the
dark
ground
lightly
shadow
and
Harry
slid
from
its
back
looking
around
the
street
where
the
overflowing
skip
still
stood
short
way
from
the
vandalised
telephone
box
both
drained
colour
the
flat
orange
glare
the
streetlights
Ron
landed
short
way
off
and
toppled
immediately
from
his
Thestral
the
pavement
Never
again
said
struggling
his
feet
made
though
stride
away
from
his
Thestral
but
unable
see
collided
with
its
hindquarters
and
almost
fell
over
again
Never
ever
again
that
was
the
worst
Hermione
and
Ginny
touched
down
either
side
him
both
slid
off
their
mounts
little
more
gracefully
than
Ron
though
with
similar
expressions
relief
being
back
firm
ground
Neville
jumped
down
shaking
and
Luna
dismounted
smoothly
Where
from
here
then
she
asked
Harry
politely
interested
voice
though
this
was
all
rather
interesting
day
trip
Over
here
said
gave
his
Thestral
quick
grateful
pat
then
led
the
way
quickly
the
battered
telephone
box
and
opened
the
door
Come
urged
the
others
they
hesitated
Ron
and
Ginny
marched
obediently
Hermione
Neville
and
Luna
squashed
themselves
after
them
Harry
took
one
glance
back
the
Thestrals
now
foraging
for
scraps
rotten
food
inside
the
skip
then
forced
himself
into
the
box
after
Luna
Whoever
nearest
the
receiver
dial
six
two
four
four
two
said
Ron
did
his
arm
bent
bizarrely
reach
the
dial
whirred
back
into
place
the
cool
female
voice
sounded
inside
the
box
Welcome
the
Ministry
Magic
Please
state
your
name
and
business
Harry
Potter
Ron
Weasley
Hermione
Granger
Harry
said
very
quickly
Ginny
Weasley
Neville
Longbottom
Luna
Lovegood
here
save
someone
unless
your
Ministry
can
first
Thank
you
said
the
cool
female
voice
Visitors
please
take
the
badges
and
attach
them
the
front
your
robes
Half
dozen
badges
slid
out
the
metal
chute
where
returned
coins
normally
appeared
Hermione
scooped
them
and
handed
them
mutely
Harry
over
Ginny
head
glanced
the
topmost
one
Harry

Rescue
Mission
Visitors
the
Ministry
you
are
required
submit
search
and
present
your
wands
for
registration
the
security
desk
which
located
the
far
end
the
Atrium
Fine
Harry
said
loudly
his
scar
gave
another
throb
Now
can
move
The
floor
the
telephone
box
shuddered
and
the
pavement
rose
past
its
glass
windows
the
scavenging
Thestrals
were
sliding
out
sight
blackness
closed
over
their
heads
and
with
dull
grinding
noise
they
sank
down
into
the
depths
the
Ministry
Magic
chink
soft
golden
light
hit
their
feet
and
widening
rose
their
bodies
Harry
bent
his
knees
and
held
his
wand
ready
could
such
cramped
conditions
peered
through
the
glass
see
whether
anybody
was
waiting
for
them
the
Atrium
but
seemed
completely
empty
The
light
was
dimmer
than
had
been
day
there
were
fires
burning
under
the
mantelpieces
set
into
the
walls
but
the
lift
slid
smoothly
halt
saw
that
golden
symbols
continued
twist
sinuously
the
dark
blue
ceiling
The
Ministry
Magic
wishes
you
pleasant
evening
said
the
woman
voice
The
door
the
telephone
box
burst
open
Harry
toppled
out
closely
followed
Neville
and
Luna
The
only
sound
the
Atrium
was
the
steady
rush
water
from
the
golden
fountain
where
jets
from
the
wands
the
witch
and
wizard
the
point
the
centaur
arrow
the
tip
the
goblin
hat
and
the
house
elf
ears
continued
gush
into
the
surrounding
pool
Come
said
Harry
quietly
and
the
six
them
sprinted
off
down
the
hall
Harry
the
lead
past
the
fountain
towards
the
desk
where
the
watchwizard
who
had
weighed
Harry
wand
had
sat
and
which
was
now
deserted
Harry
felt
sure
there
ought
security
person
there
sure
their
absence
was
ominous
sign
and
his
feeling
foreboding
increased
they
passed
through
the
golden
gates
the
lifts
pressed
the
nearest
down
button
and
lift
clattered
into
sight
almost
immediately
the
golden
grilles
slid
apart
with
great
echoing
clanking
and
they
dashed
inside
Harry
stabbed
the
number
nine
button
the
grilles
closed
with
bang
and
the
lift
began
descend
jangling
and
rattling
Harry
had
not
realised
how
noisy
the
lifts
were
the
day
had
come
with
Weasley
was
sure
the
din
would
raise
every
security
person
within
the
building
yet
when
the
lift
halted
the
cool
female
voice
said
Department
Mysteries
and
the
grilles
slid
open
They
stepped
out
into
the
corridor
where
nothing
was
moving
but
the
nearest
torches
flickering
the
rush
air
from
the
lift
Harry
turned
towards
the
plain
black
door
After
months
and
months
dreaming
about
was
here
last
Let
whispered
and
led
the
way
down
the
corridor
Luna
right
behind
him
gazing
around
with
her
mouth
slightly
open
listen
said
Harry
stopping
again
within
six
feet
the
door
Maybe
maybe
couple
people
should
stay
here
lookout
and
And
how
going
let
you
know
something
coming
asked
Ginny
her
eyebrows
raised
You
could
miles
away
coming
with
you
Harry
said
Neville
Let
get
with
said
Ron
firmly
Harry
still
did
not
want
take
them
all
with
him
but
seemed
had
choice
turned
face
the
door
and
walked
forwards
just
had
his
dream
swung
open
and
marched
over
the
threshold
the
others
his
heels
They
were
standing
large
circular
room
Everything
here
was
black
including
the
floor
and
ceiling
identical
unmarked
handleless
black
doors
were
set
intervals
all
around
the
black
walls
interspersed
with
branches
candles
whose
flames
burned
blue
their
cool
shimmering
light
reflected
the
shining
marble
floor
made
look
though
there
was
dark
water
underfoot
Someone
shut
the
door
Harry
muttered
regretted
giving
this
order
the
moment
Neville
had
obeyed
Without
the
long
chink
light
from
the
torchlit
corridor
behind
them
the
place
became
dark
that
for
moment
the
only
things
they
could
see
were
the
bunches
shivering
blue
flames
the
walls
and
their
ghostly
reflections
the
floor
his
dream
Harry
had
always
walked
purposefully
across
this
room
the
door
immediately
opposite
the
entrance
and
walked
But
there
were
around
dozen
doors
here
Just
was
gazing
ahead
the
doors
opposite
him
trying
decide
which
was
the
right
one
there
was
great
rumbling
noise
and
the
candles
began
move
sideways
The
circular
wall
was
rotating
Hermione
grabbed
Harry
arm
though
frightened
the
floor
might
move
too
but
did
not
For
few
seconds
the
blue
flames
around
them
were
blurred
resemble
neon
lines
the
wall
sped
around
then
quite
suddenly
had
started
the
rumbling
stopped
and
everything
became
stationary
once
again
Harry
eyes
had
blue
streaks
burned
into
them
was
all
could
see
What
was
that
about
whispered
Ron
fearfully
think
was
stop
knowing
which
door
came
through
said
Ginny
hushed
voice
Harry
realised
once
she
was
right
could
sooner
identify
the
exit
door
than
locate
ant
the
jet
black
floor
and
the
door
through
which
they
needed
proceed
could
any
one
the
dozen
surrounding
them
How
going
get
back
out
said
Neville
uncomfortably
Well
that
doesn
matter
now
said
Harry
forcefully
blinking
try
erase
the
blue
lines
from
his
vision
and
clutching
his
wand
tighter
than
ever
won
need
get
out
till
found
Sirius
Don
calling
for
him
though
Hermione
said
urgently
but
Harry
had
never
needed
her
advice
less
his
instinct
was
keep
quiet
possible
Where
then
Harry
Ron
asked
don
Harry
began
swallowed
the
dreams
went
through
the
door
the
end
the
corridor
from
the
lifts
into
dark
room
that
this
one
and
then
went
through
another
door
into
room
that
kind
glitters
should
try
few
doors
said
hastily
llknow
the
right
way
when
see
mon
marched
straight
the
door
now
facing
him
the
others
following
close
behind
him
set
his
left
hand
against
its
cool
shining
surface
raised
his
wand
ready
strike
the
moment
opened
and
pushed
swung
open
easily
After
the
darkness
the
first
room
the
lamps
hanging
low
golden
chains
from
this
ceiling
gave
the
impression
that
this
long
rectangular
room
was
much
brighter
though
there
were
glittering
shimmering
lights
Harry
had
seen
his
dreams
The
place
was
quite
empty
except
for
few
desks
and
the
very
middle
the
room
enormous
glass
tank
deep
green
liquid
big
enough
for
all
them
swim
number
pearly
white
objects
were
drifting
around
lazily
What
those
things
whispered
Ron
Dunno
said
Harry
Are
they
fish
breathed
Ginny
Aquavirius
Maggots
said
Luna
excitedly
Dad
said
the
Ministry
were
breeding
said
Hermione
She
sounded
odd
She
moved
forward
look
through
the
side
the
tank
They
brains
Brains
Yes
wonder
what
they
doing
with
them
Harry
joined
her
the
tank
Sure
enough
there
could
mistake
now
saw
them
close
quarters
Glimmering
eerily
they
drifted
and
out
sight
the
depths
the
green
liquid
looking
something
like
slimy
cauliflowers
Let
get
out
here
said
Harry
This
isn
right
need
try
another
door
There
are
doors
here
too
said
Ron
pointing
around
the
walls
Harry
heart
sank
how
big
was
this
place
dream
went
through
that
dark
room
into
the
second
one
said
think
should
back
and
try
from
there
they
hurried
back
into
the
dark
circular
room
the
ghostly
shapes
the
brains
were
now
swimming
before
Harry
eyes
instead
the
blue
candle
flames
Wait
said
Hermione
sharply
Luna
made
close
the
door
the
brain
room
behind
them
Flagrate
She
drew
with
her
wand
midair
and
fiery
appeared
the
door
sooner
had
the
door
clicked
shut
behind
them
than
there
was
great
rumbling
and
once
again
the
wall
began
revolve
very
fast
but
now
there
was
great
red
gold
blur
amongst
the
faint
blue
and
when
all
became
still
again
the
fiery
cross
still
burned
showing
the
door
they
had
already
tried
Good
thinking
said
Harry
let
try
this
one
Again
strode
directly
the
door
facing
him
and
pushed
open
his
wand
still
raised
the
others
his
heels
This
room
was
larger
than
the
last
dimly
lit
and
rectangular
and
the
centre
was
sunken
forming
great
stone
pit
some
twenty
feet
deep
They
were
standing
the
topmost
tier
what
seemed
stone
benches
running
all
around
the
room
and
descending
steep
steps
like
amphitheatre
the
courtroom
which
Harry
had
been
tried
the
Wizengamot
Instead
chained
chair
however
there
was
raised
stone
dais
the
centre
the
pit
which
stood
stone
archway
that
looked
ancient
cracked
and
crumbling
that
Harry
was
amazed
the
thing
was
still
standing
Unsupported
any
surrounding
wall
the
archway
was
hung
with
tattered
black
curtain
veil
which
despite
the
complete
stillness
the
cold
surrounding
air
was
fluttering
very
slightly
though
had
just
been
touched
Who
there
said
Harry
jumping
down
the
bench
below
There
was
answering
voice
but
the
veil
continued
flutter
and
sway
Careful
whispered
Hermione
Harry
scrambled
down
the
benches
one
one
until
reached
the
stone
bottom
the
sunken
pit
His
footsteps
echoed
loudly
walked
slowly
towards
the
dais
The
pointed
archway
looked
much
taller
from
where
now
stood
than
had
when
been
looking
down
from
above
Still
the
veil
swayed
gently
though
somebody
had
just
passed
through
Sirius
Harry
spoke
again
but
more
quietly
now
that
was
nearer
had
the
strangest
feeling
that
there
was
someone
standing
right
behind
the
veil
the
other
side
the
archway
Gripping
his
wand
very
tightly
edged
around
the
dais
but
there
was
nobody
there
all
that
could
seen
was
the
other
side
the
tattered
black
veil
Let
called
Hermione
from
halfway
the
stone
steps
This
isn
right
Harry
come
let
She
sounded
scared
much
more
scared
than
she
had
the
room
where
the
brains
swam
yet
Harry
thought
the
archway
had
kind
beauty
about
old
though
was
The
gently
rippling
veil
intrigued
him
felt
very
strong
inclination
climb
the
dais
and
walk
through
Harry
let
said
Hermione
more
forcefully
said
but
did
not
move
had
just
heard
something
There
were
faint
whispering
murmuring
noises
coming
from
the
other
side
the
veil
What
are
you
saying
said
very
loudly
that
his
words
echoed
all
around
the
stone
benches
Nobody
talking
Harry
said
Hermione
now
moving
over
him
Someone
whispering
behind
there
said
moving
out
her
reach
and
continuing
frown
the
veil
that
you
Ron
here
mate
said
Ron
appearing
around
the
side
the
archway
Can
anyone
else
hear
Harry
demanded
for
the
whispering
and
murmuring
was
becoming
louder
without
really
meaning
put
there
found
his
foot
was
the
dais
can
hear
them
too
breathed
Luna
joining
them
around
the
side
the
archway
and
gazing
the
swaying
veil
There
are
peoplein
there
What
you
mean
there
demanded
Hermione
jumping
down
from
the
bottom
step
and
sounding
much
angrier
than
the
occasion
warranted
there
isn
any
there
just
archway
there
room
for
anybody
there
Harry
stop
come
away
She
grabbed
his
arm
and
pulled
but
resisted
Harry
are
supposed
here
for
Sirius
she
said
high
pitched
strained
voice
Sirius
Harry
repeated
still
gazing
mesmerised
the
continuously
swaying
veil
Yeah
Something
finally
slid
back
into
place
his
brain
Sirius
captured
bound
and
tortured
and
was
staring
this
archway
took
several
paces
back
from
the
dais
and
wrenched
his
eyes
from
the
veil
Let
said
That
what
been
trying
well
come
then
said
Hermione
and
she
led
the
way
back
around
the
dais
the
other
side
Ginny
and
Neville
were
staring
apparently
entranced
the
veil
too
Without
speaking
Hermione
took
hold
Ginny
arm
Ron
grabbed
Neville
and
they
marched
them
firmly
back
the
lowest
stone
bench
and
clambered
all
the
way
back
the
door
What
you
reckon
that
arch
was
Harry
asked
Hermione
they
regained
the
dark
circular
room
don
know
but
whatever
was
was
dangerous
she
said
firmly
again
inscribing
fiery
cross
the
door
Once
more
the
wall
span
and
became
still
again
Harry
approached
another
door
random
and
pushed
did
not
move
What
wrong
said
Hermione
locked
said
Harry
throwing
his
weight
the
door
but
didn
budge
This
then
isn
said
Ron
excitedly
joining
Harry
the
attempt
force
the
door
open
Bound
Get
out
the
way
said
Hermione
sharply
She
pointed
her
wand
the
place
where
lock
would
have
been
ordinary
door
and
said
Alohomora
Nothing
happened
Sirius
knife
said
Harry
pulled
out
from
inside
his
robes
and
slid
into
the
crack
between
the
door
and
the
wall
The
others
all
watched
eagerly
ran
from
top
bottom
withdrew
and
then
flung
his
shoulder
again
the
door
remained
firmly
shut
ever
What
was
more
when
Harry
looked
down
the
knife
saw
the
blade
had
melted
Right
leaving
that
room
said
Hermione
decisively
But
what
that
the
one
said
Ron
staring
with
mixture
apprehension
and
longing
can
Harry
could
get
through
all
the
doors
his
dream
said
Hermione
marking
the
door
with
another
fiery
cross
Harry
replaced
the
now
useless
handle
Sirius
knife
his
pocket
You
know
what
could
there
said
Luna
eagerly
the
wall
started
spin
yet
again
Something
blibbering
doubt
said
Hermione
under
her
breath
and
Neville
gave
nervous
little
laugh
The
wall
slid
halt
and
Harry
with
feeling
increasing
desperation
pushed
the
next
door
open
This
isit
knew
once
the
beautiful
dancing
diamond
sparkling
light
Harry
eyes
became
accustomed
the
brilliant
glare
saw
clocks
gleaming
from
every
surface
large
and
small
grandfather
and
carriage
hanging
spaces
between
the
bookcases
standing
desks
ranging
the
length
the
room
that
busy
relentless
ticking
filled
the
place
like
thousands
minuscule
marching
footsteps
The
source
the
dancing
diamond
bright
light
was
towering
crystal
bell
jar
that
stood
the
far
end
the
room
This
way
Harry
heart
was
pumping
frantically
now
that
knew
they
were
the
right
track
led
the
way
down
the
narrow
space
between
the
lines
desks
heading
had
done
his
dream
for
the
source
the
light
the
crystal
bell
jar
quite
tall
was
that
stood
desk
and
appeared
full
billowing
glittering
wind
look
said
Ginny
they
drew
nearer
pointing
the
very
heart
the
bell
jar
Drifting
along
the
sparkling
current
inside
was
tiny
jewel
bright
egg
rose
the
jar
cracked
open
and
hummingbird
emerged
which
was
carried
the
very
top
the
jar
but
fell
the
draught
its
feathers
became
bedraggled
and
damp
again
and
the
time
had
been
borne
back
the
bottom
the
jar
had
been
enclosed
once
more
its
egg
Keep
going
said
Harry
sharply
because
Ginny
showed
signs
wanting
stop
and
watch
the
egg
progress
back
into
bird
You
dawdled
enough
that
old
arch
she
said
crossly
but
followed
him
past
the
bell
jar
the
only
door
behind
This
Harry
said
again
and
his
heart
was
now
pumping
hard
and
fast
felt
must
interfere
with
his
speech
through
here
glanced
around
them
all
they
had
their
wands
out
and
looked
suddenly
serious
and
anxious
looked
back
the
door
and
pushed
swung
open
They
were
there
they
had
found
the
place
high
church
and
full
nothing
but
towering
shelves
covered
small
dusty
glass
orbs
They
glimmered
dully
the
light
issuing
from
more
candle
brackets
set
intervals
along
the
shelves
Like
those
the
circular
room
behind
them
their
flames
were
burning
blue
The
room
was
very
cold
Harry
edged
forward
and
peered
down
one
the
shadowy
aisles
between
two
rows
shelves
could
not
hear
anything
see
the
slightest
sign
movement
You
said
was
row
ninety
seven
whispered
Hermione
Yeah
breathed
Harry
looking
the
end
the
closest
row
Beneath
the
branch
blue
glowing
candles
protruding
from
glimmered
the
silver
figure
fifty
three
need
right
think
whispered
Hermione
squinting
the
next
row
Yes
that
fifty
four
Keep
your
wands
ready
Harry
said
softly
They
crept
forward
glancing
behind
them
they
went
down
the
long
alleys
shelves
the
further
ends
which
were
near
total
darkness
Tiny
yellowing
labels
had
been
stuck
beneath
each
glass
orb
the
shelves
Some
them
had
weird
liquid
glow
others
were
dull
and
dark
within
blown
light
bulbs
They
passed
row
eighty
four
eighty
five
Harry
was
listening
hard
for
the
slightest
sound
movement
but
Sirius
might
gagged
now
else
unconscious
said
unbidden
voice
inside
his
head
might
already
dead
have
felt
told
himself
his
heart
now
hammering
against
his
Adam
apple
already
know
Ninety
seven
whispered
Hermione
They
stood
grouped
around
the
end
the
row
gazing
down
the
alley
beside
There
was
nobody
there
right
down
the
end
said
Harry
whose
mouth
had
become
slightly
dry
You
can
see
properly
from
here
And
led
them
between
the
towering
rows
glass
balls
some
which
glowed
softly
they
passed
should
near
here
whispered
Harry
convinced
that
every
step
was
going
bring
the
ragged
form
Sirius
into
view
the
darkened
floor
Anywhere
here
really
close
Harry
said
Hermione
tentatively
but
did
not
want
respond
His
mouth
was
very
dry
Somewhere
about
here
said
They
had
reached
the
end
the
row
and
emerged
into
more
dim
candlelight
There
was
nobody
there
All
was
echoing
dusty
silence
might
Harry
whispered
hoarsely
peering
down
the
next
alley
maybe
hurried
look
down
the
one
beyond
that
Harry
said
Hermione
again
What
snarled
don
think
Sirius
here
Nobody
spoke
Harry
did
not
want
look
any
them
felt
sick
did
not
understand
why
Sirius
was
not
here
had
here
This
was
where
Harry
had
seen
him
ran
the
space
the
end
the
rows
staring
down
them
Empty
aisle
after
empty
aisle
flickered
past
ran
the
other
way
back
past
his
staring
companions
There
was
sign
Sirius
anywhere
nor
any
hint
struggle
Harry
Ron
called
What
did
not
want
hear
what
Ron
had
say
did
not
want
hear
Ron
tell
him
had
been
stupid
suggest
that
they
ought
back
Hogwarts
but
the
heat
was
rising
his
face
and
felt
though
would
like
skulk
down
here
the
darkness
for
long
while
before
facing
the
brightness
the
Atrium
above
and
the
others
accusing
stares
Have
you
seen
this
said
Ron
What
said
Harry
but
eagerly
this
time
had
sign
that
Sirius
had
been
there
clue
strode
back
where
they
were
all
standing
little
way
down
row
ninety
seven
but
found
nothing
except
Ron
staring
one
the
dusty
glass
spheres
the
shelf
What
Harry
repeated
glumly
got
your
name
said
Ron
Harry
moved
little
closer
Ron
was
pointing
one
the
small
glass
spheres
that
glowed
with
dull
inner
light
though
was
very
dusty
and
appeared
not
have
been
touched
for
many
years
name
said
Harry
blankly
stepped
forwards
Not
tall
Ron
had
crane
his
neck
read
the
yellowish
label
affixed
the
shelf
right
beneath
the
dusty
glass
ball
spidery
writing
was
written
date
some
sixteen
years
previously
and
below
that
Dark
Lord
and
Harry
Potter
Harry
stared
What
Ron
asked
sounding
unnerved
What
your
name
doing
down
here
glanced
along
the
other
labels
that
stretch
shelf
not
here
said
sounding
perplexed
None
the
rest
are
here
Harry
don
think
you
should
touch
said
Hermione
sharply
stretched
out
his
hand
Why
not
said
something
with
isn
Don
Harry
said
Neville
suddenly
Harry
looked
him
Neville
round
face
was
shining
slightly
with
sweat
looked
though
could
not
take
much
more
suspense
got
name
said
Harry
And
feeling
slightly
reckless
closed
his
fingers
around
the
dusty
ball
surface
had
expected
feel
cold
but
did
not
the
contrary
felt
though
had
been
lying
the
sun
for
hours
though
the
glow
light
within
was
warming
Expecting
even
hoping
that
something
dramatic
was
going
happen
something
exciting
that
might
make
their
long
and
dangerous
journey
worthwhile
after
all
Harry
lifted
the
glass
ball
down
from
its
shelf
and
stared
Nothing
whatsoever
happened
The
others
moved
closer
around
Harry
gazing
the
orb
brushed
free
the
clogging
dust
And
then
from
right
behind
them
drawling
voice
spoke
Very
good
Potter
Now
turn
around
nice
and
slowly
and
give
that
BEYOND
THE
VEIL
Black
shapes
were
emerging
out
thin
air
all
around
them
blocking
their
way
left
and
right
eyes
glinted
through
slits
hoods
dozen
lit
wand
tips
were
pointing
directly
their
hearts
Ginny
gave
gasp
horror
Potter
repeated
the
drawling
voice
Lucius
Malfoy
held
out
his
hand
palm
Harry
insides
plummeted
sickeningly
They
were
trapped
and
outnumbered
two
one
said
Malfoy
yet
again
Where
Sirius
Harry
said
Several
the
Death
Eaters
laughed
harsh
female
voice
from
the
midst
the
shadowy
figures
Harry
left
said
triumphantly
The
Dark
Lord
always
knows
Always
echoed
Malfoy
softly
Now
give
the
prophecy
Potter
want
know
where
Sirius
want
know
where
Sirius
mimicked
the
woman
his
left
She
and
her
fellow
Death
Eaters
had
closed
that
they
were
mere
feet
away
from
Harry
and
the
others
the
light
from
their
wands
dazzling
Harry
eyes
You
got
him
said
Harry
ignoring
the
rising
panic
his
chest
the
dread
had
been
fighting
since
they
had
first
entered
the
ninety
seventh
row
here
know
The
little
baby
woke
fwightened
and
fort

twoo
said
the
woman
horrible
mock
baby
voice
Harry
felt
Ron
stir
beside
him
Don

Harry
muttered
Not

The
woman
who
had
mimicked
him
let
out
raucous
scream
laughter
You

You

him
Giving
instructions
the
other
children
though
thinks
fighting
you

Potter
Bellatrix
said
Malfoy
softly
has
great
weakness
for
heroics
the
Dark
Lord
understands
this
about
him
Now
give
the
prophecy
Potter

Sirius

said
Harry
though
panic
was
causing
his
chest
constrict
and
felt
though
could
not
breathe
properly
know
you
got
him
More
the
Death
Eaters
laughed
though
the
woman
laughed
loudest
all
time
you
learned
the
difference
between
life
and
dreams
Potter
said
Malfoy
Now
give
the
prophecy
start
using
wands
then
said
Harry
raising
his
own
wand
chest
height
did
the
five
wands
Ron
Hermione
Neville
Ginny
and
Luna
rose
either
side
him
The
knot
Harry
stomach
tightened
Sirius
really
was
not
here
had
led
his
friends
their
deaths
for
reason
all
But
the
Death
Eaters
did
not
strike
Hand
over
the
prophecy
and
one
need
get
hurt
said
Malfoy
coolly
was
Harry
turn
laugh
Yeah
right
said
give
you
this
prophecy
And
you
just
let
skip
off
home
will
you
The
words
were
hardly
out
his
mouth
when
the
female
Death
Eater
shrieked
Accio
proph
Harry
was
just
ready
for
her
shouted
Protego
before
she
had
finished
her
spell
and
though
the
glass
sphere
slipped
the
tips
his
fingers
managed
cling
knows
how
play
little
bitty
baby
Potter
she
said
her
mad
eyes
staring
through
the
slits
her
hood
Very
well
then
TOLD
YOU
Lucius
Malfoy
roared
the
woman
you
smash
Harry
mind
was
racing
The
Death
Eaters
wanted
this
dusty
spun
glass
sphere
had
interest
just
wanted
get
them
all
out
this
alive
make
sure
none
his
friends
paid
terrible
price
for
his
stupidity
The
woman
stepped
forward
away
from
her
fellows
and
pulled
off
her
hood
Azkaban
had
hollowed
Bellatrix
Lestrange
face
making
gaunt
and
skull
like
but
was
alive
with
feverish
fanatical
glow
You
need
more
persuasion
she
said
her
chest
rising
and
falling
rapidly
Very
well
take
the
smallest
one
she
ordered
the
Death
Eaters
beside
her
Let
him
watch
while
torture
the
little
girl
Harry
felt
the
others
close
around
Ginny
stepped
sideways
that
was
right
front
her
the
prophecy
held
his
chest
You
have
smash
this
you
want
attack
any
told
Bellatrix
don
think
your
boss
will
too
pleased
you
come
back
without
will
She
did
not
move
she
merely
stared
him
the
tip
her
tongue
moistening
her
thin
mouth
said
Harry
what
kind
prophecy
are
talking
about
anyway
could
not
think
what
but
keep
talking
Neville
arm
was
pressed
against
his
and
could
feel
him
shaking
could
feel
one
the
others
quickened
breath
the
back
his
head
was
hoping
they
were
all
thinking
hard
about
ways
get
out
this
because
his
mind
was
blank
What
kind
prophecy
repeated
Bellatrix
the
grin
fading
from
her
face
You
jest
Harry
Potter
Nope
not
jesting
said
Harry
his
eyes
flicking
from
Death
Eater
Death
Eater
looking
for
weak
link
space
through
which
they
could
escape
How
come
Voldemort
wants
Several
the
Death
Eaters
let
out
low
hisses
You
dare
speak
his
name
whispered
Bellatrix
Yeah
said
Harry
maintaining
his
tight
grip
the
glass
ball
expecting
another
attempt
bewitch
from
him
Yeah
got
problem
with
saying
Vol
Shut
your
mouth
Bellatrix
shrieked
You
dare
speak
his
name
with
your
unworthy
lips
you
dare
besmirch
with
your
half
blood
tongue
you
dare
Did
you
know
half
blood
too
said
Harry
recklessly
Hermione
gave
little
moan
his
ear
Voldemort
Yeah
his
mother
was
witch
but
his
dad
was
Muggle
has
been
telling
you
lot
pure
blood
STUPEF
jet
red
light
had
shot
from
the
end
Bellatrix
Lestrange
wand
but
Malfoy
had
deflected
his
spell
caused
hers
hit
the
shelf
foot
the
left
Harry
and
several
the
glass
orbs
there
shattered
Two
figures
pearly
white
ghosts
fluid
smoke
unfurled
themselves
from
the
fragments
broken
glass
upon
the
floor
and
each
began
speak
their
voices
vied
with
each
other
that
only
fragments
what
they
were
saying
could
heard
over
Malfoy
and
Bellatrix
shouts
the
solstice
will
come
new
said
the
figure
old
bearded
man
NOT
ATTACK
NEED
THE
PROPHECY
dared
dares
shrieked
Bellatrix
incoherently
stands
there
filthy
half
blood
WAIT
UNTIL
GOT
THE
PROPHECY
bawled
Malfoy
and
none
will
come
after
said
the
figure
young
woman
The
two
figures
that
had
burst
from
the
shattered
spheres
had
melted
into
thin
air
Nothing
remained
them
their
erstwhile
homes
but
fragments
glass
upon
the
floor
They
had
however
given
Harry
idea
The
problem
was
going
conveying
the
others
You
haven
told
what
special
about
this
prophecy
supposed
handing
over
said
playing
for
time
moved
his
foot
slowly
sideways
feeling
around
for
someone
else
not
play
games
with
Potter
said
Malfoy
not
playing
games
said
Harry
half
his
mind
the
conversation
half
his
wandering
foot
And
then
found
someone
toes
and
pressed
down
upon
them
sharp
intake
breath
behind
him
told
him
they
were
Hermione
What
she
whispered
Dumbledore
never
told
you
the
reason
you
bear
that
scar
was
hidden
the
bowels
the
Department
Mysteries
Malfoy
sneered
what
said
Harry
And
for
moment
quite
forgot
his
plan
What
about
scar
What
whispered
Hermione
more
urgently
behind
him
Can
this
said
Malfoy
sounding
maliciously
delighted
some
the
Death
Eaters
were
laughing
again
and
under
cover
their
laughter
Harry
hissed
Hermione
moving
his
lips
little
possible
Smash
shelves
Dumbledore
never
told
you
Malfoy
repeated
Well
this
explains
why
you
didn
come
earlier
Potter
the
Dark
Lord
wondered
why
when
saynow
you
didn
come
running
when
showed
you
the
place
where
was
hidden
your
dreams
thought
natural
curiosity
would
make
you
want
hear
the
exact
wording
Did
said
Harry
Behind
him
felt
rather
than
heard
Hermione
passing
his
message
the
others
and
sought
keep
talking
distract
the
Death
Eaters
wanted
come
and
get
did
Why
Why
Malfoy
sounded
incredulously
delighted
Because
the
only
people
who
are
permitted
retrieve
prophecy
from
the
Department
Mysteries
Potter
are
those
about
whom
was
made
the
Dark
Lord
discovered
when
attempted
use
others
steal
for
him
And
why
did
want
steal
prophecy
about
About
both
you
Potter
about
both
you
haven
you
ever
wondered
why
the
Dark
Lord
tried
kill
you
baby
Harry
stared
into
the
slitted
eye
holes
through
which
Malfoy
grey
eyes
were
gleaming
Was
this
prophecy
the
reason
Harry
parents
had
died
the
reason
carried
his
lightning
bolt
scar
Was
the
answer
all
this
clutched
his
hand
Someone
made
prophecy
about
Voldemort
and
said
quietly
gazing
Lucius
Malfoy
his
fingers
tightening
over
the
warm
glass
sphere
his
hand
was
hardly
larger
than
Snitch
and
still
gritty
with
dust
And
made
come
and
get
for
him
Why
couldn
come
and
getit
himself
Get
himself
shrieked
Bellatrix
over
cackle
mad
laughter
The
Dark
Lord
walk
into
the
Ministry
Magic
when
they
are
sweetly
ignoring
his
return
The
Dark
Lord
reveal
himself
the
Aurors
when
the
moment
they
are
wasting
their
time
dear
cousin
got
you
doing
his

Five

into

there
their

from

there
were
cries

and
thunderous

the

collapsed
upon
themselves
weirdly
echoing

the
Seers

from

Harry
found
the

and
saw
Ron
Ginny
and
Luna

past

Harry

see
the

through
the

the

and
safe
his

and
waited
for

over
the
threshold
before
slamming
the

behind
them
Colloportus

Hermione
and
the

sealed
itself
with
odd
squelching
noise
Where

Harry
Let

They
ran
quietly
they
could
past
the
shimmering
bell
jar
where
the
tiny
egg
was
hatching
and
unhatching
towards
the
exit
into
the
circular
hallway
the
far
end
ofthe
room
They
were
almost
there
when
Harry
heard
something
large
and
heavy
collide
with
the
door
Hermione
had
charmed

Stand

rough
voice
Alohomora
the

Harry
Hermione
and
Neville
dived
under

They
could
see
the

two
Death

moving
rapidly
They

Check

Avada
Harry
launched
himself
across
the
floor
and
grabbed
the
Death
Eater
around
the
knees
causing
him
topple
and
his
aim
awry
Neville
overturned

his
anxiety

and
pointing
his
wand
wildly
the
struggling
pair
cried
EXPELLIARMUS
Both
Harry
and
the
Death
Eater
wands
flew
out
their
hands
and
soared
back
towards
the
entrance
the
Hall
Prophecy
both
scrambled
their
feet
and
charged
after

Harry
hot
his

and
Neville
bringing
the

plainly
horrorstruck

Get

Harry
yelled
Neville
clearly
determined

the
damage
Harry
flung
himself
sideways
Neville
took
aim
again
and
shouted
STUPEFY
The
jet
red
light
flew
right
over
the
Death
Eater
shoulder
and
hit
glass
fronted
cabinet
the
wall
full
variously
shaped
hour
glasses
the
cabinet
fell
the
floor
and
burst
apart
glass
flying
everywhere
sprang
back
the
wall
fully
mended
then
fell
down
again
and
shattered
The
Death
Eater
had
snatched
his
wand
which
lay
the
floor
beside
the
glittering
bell
jar
Harry
ducked
down
behind
another
desk
the
man
turned
his
mask
had
slipped
that
couldn
see
ripped
off
with
his
free
hand
and
shouted
STUP
STUPEFY
screamed
Hermione
who
had
just
caught
with
them
The

light
hit
the
Death
Eater
the
middle
his
chest
froze
his
arm
still
raised
his
wand
fell
the
floor
with
clatter
and
collapsed
backwards
towards
the

Harry
expected
hear
dunk
for
the
man
hit
solid

and
slide
off
the
jar
the
floor
but
instead
his
head
sank
through
the
surface
the
bell
jar
though
were
nothing
but
soap
bubble
and
came
rest
sprawled
his
back

with

lying
inside

cried
Hermione
Harry

from
dark
corner
into
her

and
she
threw
him
Thanks

Right

out
Look
out
said
Neville
horrified
was
staring
the
Death
Eater
head
the
bell
jar
All
three
them
raised
their
wands
again
but
none
them
struck
they
were
all
gazing
open
mouthed
appalled
what
was
happening
the
man
head
was
shrinking
very
fast
growing
balder
and
balder
the
black
hair
and
stubble
retracting
into
his
skull
his
cheeks
becoming
smooth
his
skull
round
and
covered
with
peachlike
fuzz
baby
head
now
sat
grotesquely
top
the
thick
muscled
neck
the
Death
Eater
struggled
get
again
but
even
they
watched
their
mouths
open
the
head
began
swell
its
previous
proportions
again
thick
black
hair
was
sprouting
from
the
pate
and
chin
Time
said
Hermione
awestruck
voice
Time
The
Death
Eater
shook
his
ugly
head
again
trying
clear
but
before
could
pull
himself
together
began
shrink
back
babyhood
once
more
There
was
shout
from
room
nearby
then
crash
and
scream
RON
Harry
yelled
turning
quickly
from
the
monstrous
transformation
taking
place
before
them
GINNY
LUNA
Harry
Hermione
screamed
The
Death
Eater
had
pulled
his
head
out
the
bell
jar
His
appearance
was
utterly
bizarre
his
tiny
baby
head
bawling
loudly
while
his
thick
arms
flailed
dangerously
all
directions
narrowly
missing
Harry
who
had
ducked
Harry
raised
his
wand
but
his
amazement
Hermione
seized
his
arm
You
can
hurt
baby
There
was
time
argue
the
point
Harry
could
hear
more
footsteps
growing
louder
from
the
Hall
Prophecy
and
knew
too
late
that
ought
not
have
shouted
and
given
away
their
position
Come
said
and
leaving
the
ugly
baby
headed
Death
Eater
staggering
behind
them
they
took
off
for
the
door
that
stood
open
the
other
end
the
room
leading
back
into
the
black
hallway
They
had
run
halfway
towards
when
Harry
saw
through
the
open
door
two
more
Death
Eaters
running
across
the
black
room
towards
them
veering
left
burst
instead
into
small
dark
cluttered
office
and
slammed
the
door
behind
them
Collo
began
Hermione
but
before
she
could
complete
the
spell
the
door
had
burst
open
and
the
two
Death
Eaters
had
come
hurtling
inside
With
cry
triumph
both
yelled
IMPEDIMENTA
Harry
Hermione
and
Neville
were
all
knocked
backwards
off
their
feet
Neville
was
thrown
over
the
desk
and
disappeared
from

Hermione
smashed
into

and
was
promptly
deluged

Harry
head
slammed
into
the
stone
wall
behind
him
tiny
lights
burst
front
his
eyes
and
for
moment
was
too
dizzy
and
bewildered
react

the
Death

his

Death

Petrificus

shouted
Harry
the
second
Death

raised
his

His

snapped
together
and
fell

stiff

and
unable

Well

But
the
Death

Hermione
had
just

made
sudden
slashing
movement
with
his
wand
streak
what
looked
like
purple
flame
passed
right
across
Hermione
chest
She
gave
tiny
though
surprise
and
crumpled
the
floor
where
she
lay
motionless
HERMIONE
Harry
fell
his
knees
beside
her
Neville
crawled
rapidly
towards
her
from
under
the
desk
his
wand
held
front
him
The
Death
Eater
kicked
out
hard
Neville
head
emerged
his
foot
broke
Neville

and
connected
with
his
face
Neville
gave
howl
pain
and
recoiled
clutching
his
mouth
and
nose
Harry
twisted
around
his
own
wand
held
high
and
saw
that
the
Death
Eater
had
ripped
off
his
mask
and
was
pointing
his
wand
directlyat
Harry
who
recognised
the
long
pale
twisted
face
from
theDaily
Prophet
Antonin
Dolohov
the
wizard
who
had
murdered
the
Prewetts
Dolohov
grinned
With
his
free
hand
pointed
from
the
prophecy
still
clutched
Harry
hand
himself
then
Hermione
Though
could
longer
speak
his
meaning
could
not
have
been
clearer
Give

Like

the
moment

Harry

said
Neville

under
the
desk
lowering
his
hands
show
clearly
broken
nose
and
blood
pouring
down
his
mouth
and
chin
don

Then
there
was
crash
outside
the
door
and
Dolohov
looked
over
his
shoulder
the
baby
headed
Death
Eater
had
appeared
the
doorway
his
head
bawling
his
great
fists
still
flailing
uncontrollably
everything
around
him
Harry
seized
his
chance
PETRIFICUS
TOTALUS
The

Dolohov
before

and
toppled
forwards
across
his

Such

swept
through
Harry

There
was
pause
which
Harry
listened
hard
for
the
sound
more
footsteps
but
all
could
hear
were
the
whimpers
and
blunderings

hesitated
then
grabbed
the

and
helped
hoist
Hermione
limp
form
over
Neville
shoulders

Harry
snatching
Hermione

from
the

and
shoving

Harry
stuck
his
head
out
the
door
and
looked
around
cautiously
The
baby
headed
Death
Eater
was
screaming
and
banging
into
things
toppling
grandfather
clocks
and
overturning
desks
bawling
and
confused
while
the
glass
fronted
cabinet
that
Harry
now
suspected
had
contained
Time
Turners
continued

whispered
mon

They
crept
out
the
office
and
back
towards
the
door
into
the
black
hallway
which
now
seemed
completely
deserted
They
walked
few
steps
forwards
Neville
tottering
slightly
due
Hermione
weight
the
door
the
Time
Room
swung
shut
behind
them
and
the
walls
began
rotate
once
more
The
recent
blow
the
back
Harry
head
seemed
have
unsteadied
him
narrowed
his
eyes
swaying
slightly
until
the
walls
stopped
moving
again
With
sinking
heart
Harry
saw
that
Hermione
fiery
crosses
had
faded
from
the
doors
which
way
you
reck
But
before
they
could
make
decision
which
way
try
door
their
right
sprang
open
and
three
people
fell
out
Ron
croaked
Harry
dashing
towards
them
Ginny

Harry
said
Ron
giggling
weakly
lurching
forwards
seizing

gazing

with
unfocused
eyes
there

funny
Harry

Ron
face
was
very
white
and
something
dark
was
trickling
from
the
corner
his
mouth
Next
moment
his
knees
had
given
way
but
still
clutched
the
front
Harry
robes
that
Harry
was
pulled
into
kind
bow
Ginny
Harry
said
fearfully
What
happened
But
Ginny
shook
her
head
and
slid
down
the
wall
into
sitting
position
panting
and
holding
her
ankle
think
her
ankle
broken
heard
something
crack
whispered
Luna

Harry
fearfully
Ron

Ginny
impatiently
but
next
moment
she
had
collapsed

for
support

heaved
Ron
towards

were
within

feet
when
another

across

hall
burst
open
and
three
Death
Eaters
sped

Bellatrix
Lestrange
There
they

Stunning

unceremoniously
from

and
ducked
back

There

and
rolled
over

top
his
haste

the
next

Colloportus
There
were
footsteps
running
along
behind
the
doors
every
now
and
then
another
heavy
body
would
launch
itself
against
one
creaked
and
shuddered
Luna
and
Neville
were
bewitching
the
doors
along
the
opposite
wall
then
Harry
reached
the
very
top
the
room
heard
Luna
cry
Collo
aaaaaaaaargh
turned
time
see
her
flying
through
the
air
five
Death
Eaters
were
surging
into
the
room
through
the
door
she
had
not
reached
time
Luna
hit
desk
slid
over
its
surface
and
the
floor
the
other
side
where
she
lay
sprawled
still
Hermione
Get
Potter
shrieked
Bellatrix
and
she
ran
him
dodged
her
and
sprinted
back
the
room
was
safe
long
they
thought
they
might
hit
the
prophecy
Hey
said
Ron
who
had
staggered
his
feet
and
was
now
tottering
drunkenly
towards
Harry
giggling
Hey
Harry
there
arebrains
here
isn
that
weird
Harry
Ron
get
out
the
way
get
down
But
Ron
had
already
pointed
his
wand
the
tank
Honest
Harry
they
brains
look
Accio
brain
The
scene
seemed
momentarily
frozen
Harry
Ginny
and
Neville
and
each
the
Death
Eaters
turned
spite
themselves
watch
the
top
the
tank
brain
burst
from
the
green
liquid
like
leaping
fish
for
moment
seemed
suspended
midair
then
soared
towards
Ron
spinning
came
and
what
looked
like
ribbons
moving
images
flew
from
unravelling
like
rolls
film
Harry
look
said
Ron
watching
disgorge
its
gaudy
innards
Harry
come
and
touch
bet
weird
RON
Harry
did
not
know
what
would
happen
Ron
touched
the
tentacles
thought
now
flying
behind
the
brain
but
was
sure
would
not
anything
good
darted
forwards
but
Ron
had
already
caught
the
brain
his
outstretched
hands
The
moment
they
made
contact
with
his
skin
the
tentacles
began
wrapping
themselves
around
Ron
arms
like
ropes
Harry
look
what
happen
don
like
stop
stop
But
the
thin
ribbons
were
spinning
around
Ron
chest
now
tugged
and
tore
them
the
brain
was
pulled
tight
against
him
like
octopus
body
Diffindo
yelled
Harry
trying
sever
the
feelers
wrapping
themselves
tightly
around
Ron
before
his
eyes
but
they
would
not
break
Ron
fell
over
still
thrashing
against
his
bonds
Harry
suffocate
him
screamed
Ginny
immobilised
her
broken
ankle
the
floor
then
jet
red
light
flew
from
one
the
Death
Eater
wands
and
hit
her
squarely
the
face
She
keeled
over
sideways
and
lay
there
unconscious
STUBEFY
shouted
Neville
wheeling
around
and
waving
Hermione
wand
the
oncoming
Death
Eaters
STUBEFY
STUBEFY
But
nothing
happened
One
the
Death
Eaters
shot
their
own
Stunning
Spell
Neville
missed
him
inches
Harry
and
Neville
were
now
the
only
two
left
fighting
the
five
Death
Eaters
two
whom
sent
off
streams
silver
light
like
arrows
which
missed
but
left
craters
the
wall
behind
them
Harry
ran
for
Bellatrix
Lestrange
raced
right
him
holding
the
prophecy
high
above
his
head
sprinted
back
the
room
all
could
think
doing
was
draw
the
Death
Eaters
away
from
the
others
seemed
have
worked
they
streaked
after
him
knocking
chairs
and
tables
flying
but
not
daring
bewitch
him
case
they
hurt
the
prophecy
and
dashed
through
the
only
door
still
open
the
one
through
which
the
Death
Eaters
themselves
had
come
inwardly
praying
that
Neville
would
stay
with
Ron
and
find
some
way
releasing
him
ran
few
feet
into
the
new
room
and
felt
the
floor
vanish
was
falling
down
steep
stone
step
after
steep
stone
step
bouncing
every
tier
until
last
with
crash
that
knocked
all
the
breath
out
his
body
landed
flat
his
back
the
sunken
pit
where
the
stone
archway
stood
its
dais
The
whole
room
was
ringing
with
the
Death
Eaters
laughter
looked
and
saw
the
five
who
had
been
the
Brain
Room
descending
towards
him
while
many
more
emerged
through
other
doorways
and
began
leaping
from
bench
bench
towards
him
Harry
got
his
feet
though
his
legs
were
trembling
badly
they
barely
supported
him
the
prophecy
was
still
miraculously
unbroken
his
left
hand
his
wand
clutched
tightly
his
right
backed
away
looking
around
trying
keep
all
the
Death
Eaters
within
his
sight
The
back
his
legs
hit
something
solid
had
reached
the
dais
where
the
archway
stood
climbed
backwards
onto
The
Death
Eaters
all
halted
gazing
him
Some
were
panting
hard
was
One
was
bleeding
badly
Dolohov
freed
the
Body
Bind
Curse
was
leering
his
wand
pointing
straight
Harry
face
Potter
your
race
run
drawled
Lucius
Malfoy
pulling
off
his
mask
now
hand
the
prophecy
like
good
boy
Let

the
others

give

said
Harry
desperately
few
the
Death
Eaters
laughed
You

not

Potter
said
Lucius
Malfoy
his
pale
face
flushed
with
pleasure
You
see
there

ten
and
only
one

Dumbledore
ever
taught
you
how

shouted
voice
from
above
them
still
god
Harry
heart
sank
Neville
was
scrambling
down
the
stone
benches
towards
them
Hermione
wand
held
fast
his
trembling
hand
Neville
back
Ron
STUBEFY
Neville
shouted
again
pointing
his
wand
each
Death
Eater
turn
STUBEFY
STYBE
One
the
largest
Death
Eaters
seized
Neville
from
behind
pinioning
his
arms
his
sides
struggled
and
kicked
several
the
Death
Eaters
laughed
Longbottom
isn
sneered
Lucius
Malfoy
Well

grandmother
used
losing
family
members
our
cause
your
death
will
not
come
great
shock
Longbottom
repeated
Bellatrix
and
truly
evil
smile
lit
her
gaunt
face
Why
have
had
the
pleasure
meeting
your
parents
boy
DOE
YOU
HAB
roared
Neville
and
fought
hard
against
his
captors
encircling
grip
that
the
Death
Eater
shouted
Someone
Stun
him
said
Bellatrix
She
looked
transported
alive
with
excitement
she
glanced
Harry
then
back
Neville
let
see
how
long
Longbottom
lasts
before
cracks
like
his
parents
unless
Potter
wants
give
the
prophecy
DON
GIB
DEM
roared
Neville
who
seemed
beside
himself
kicking
and
writhing
Bellatrix
drew
nearer
him
and
his
captor
her
wand
raised
DON
GIB
DEM
HARRY
Bellatrix
raised
her
wand
Crucio
Neville
screamed
his
legs
drawn
his
chest
that
the
Death
Eater
holding
him
was
momentarily
holding
him
off
the
ground
The
Death
Eater
dropped
him
and
fell
the
floor
twitching
and
screaming
agony
That
was
just
taster
said
Bellatrix
raising
her
wand
that
Neville
screams
stopped
and
lay
sobbing
her
feet
She
turned
and
gazed
Harry
Now
Potter
either
give
the
prophecy
watch
your
little
friend
die
the
hard
way
Harry
did
not
have
think
there
was
choice
The
prophecy
was
hot
with
the
heat
his
clutching
hand
held
out
Malfoy
jumped
forwards
take
Then
high
above
them
two
more
doors
burst
open
and
five
more
people
sprinted
into
the
room
Sirius
Lupin
Moody
Tonks
and
Kingsley
Malfoy
turned
and
raised
his
wand
but
Tonks
had
already
sent
Stunning
Spell
right
him
Harry
did
not
wait
see
whether
had
made
contact
but
dived
off
the
dais
out
the
way
The
Death
Eaters
were
completely
distracted
the
appearance
the
members
the
Order
who
were
now
raining
spells
down
upon
them
they
jumped
from
step
step
towards
the
sunken
floor
Through
the
darting
bodies
the
flashes
light
Harry
could
see
Neville
crawling
along
dodged
another
jet
red
light
and
flung
himself
flat
the
ground
reach
Neville
Are
you
yelled
another
spell
soared
inches
over
their
heads
Yes
said
Neville
trying
pull
himself
And
Ron
dink
all
righd
was
still
fighding
brain
when
left
The
stone
floor
between
them
exploded
spell
hit
leaving
crater
right
where
Neville
hand
had
been
only
seconds
before
both
scrambled
away
from
the
spot
then
thick
arm
came
out
nowhere
seized
Harry
around
the
neck
and
pulled
him
upright
that
his
toes
were
barely
touching
the
floor
Give
growled
voice
his
ear
give
the
prophecy
The
man
was
pressing
tightly
Harry
windpipe
that
could
not
breathe
Through
watering
eyes
saw
Sirius
duelling
with
Death
Eater
some
ten
feet
away
Kingsley
was
fighting
two
once
Tonks
still
halfway
the
tiered
seats
was
firing
spells
down
Bellatrix
nobody
seemed
realise
that
Harry
was
dying
turned
his
wand
backwards
towards
the
man
side
but
had
breath
utter
incantation
and
the
man
free
hand
was
groping
towards
the
hand
which
Harry
was
grasping
the
prophecy
AARGH
Neville
had
come
lunging
out
nowhere
unable
articulate
spell
had
jabbed
Hermione
wand
hard
into
the
eyehole
the
Death
Eaters
mask
The
man
relinquished
Harry
once
with
howl
pain
Harry
whirled
around
face
him
and
gasped
STUPEFY
The
Death
Eater
keeled
over
backwards
and
his
mask
slipped
off
was
Macnair
Buckbeak
would
killer
one
his
eyes
now
swollen
and
bloodshot
Thanks
Harry
said
Neville
pulling
him
aside
Sirius
and
his
Death
Eater
lurched
past
duelling
fiercely
that
their
wands
were
blurs
then
Harry
foot
made
contact
with
something
round
and
hard
and
slipped
For
moment
thought
had
dropped
the
prophecy
but
then
saw
Moody
magical
eye
spinning
away
across
the
floor
Its
owner
was
lying
his
side
bleeding
from
the
head
and
his
attacker
was
now
bearing
down
upon
Harry
and
Neville
Dolohov
his
long
pale
face
twisted
with
glee
Tarantallegra
shouted
his
wand
pointing
Neville
whose
legs
went
immediately
into
kind
frenzied
tap
dance
unbalancing
him
and
causing
him
fall
the
floor
again
Now
Potter
made
the
same
slashing
movement
with
his
wand
that
had
used
Hermione
just
Harry
yelled
Protego
Harry
felt
something
streak
across
his
face
like
blunt
knife
the
force
knocked
him
sideways
and
fell
over
Neville
jerking
legs
but
the
Shield
Charm
had
stopped
the
worst
the
spell
Dolohov
raised
his
wand
again
Accio
proph
Sirius
had
hurtled
out
nowhere
rammed
Dolohov
with
his
shoulder
and
sent
him
flying
out
the
way
The
prophecy
had
again
flown
the
tips
Harry
fingers
but
had
managed
cling
Now
Sirius
and
Dolohov
were
duelling
their
wands
flashing
like
swords
sparks
flying
from
their
wand
tips
Dolohov
drew
back
his
wand
make
the
same
slashing
movement
had
used
Harry
and
Hermione
Springing
Harry
yelled
Petrificus
Totalus
Once
again
Dolohov
arms
and
legs
snapped
together
and
keeled
over
backwards
landing
with
crash
his
back
Nice
one
shouted
Sirius
forcing
Harry
head
down
pair
Stunning
Spells
flew
towards
them
Now
want
you
get
out
They
both
ducked
again
jet
green
light
had
narrowly
missed
Sirius
Across
the
room
Harry
saw
Tonks
fall
from
halfway
the
stone
steps
her
limp
form
toppling
from
stone
seat
stone
seat
and
Bellatrix
triumphant
running
back
towards
the
fray
Harry
take
the
prophecy
grab
Neville
and
run
Sirius
yelled
dashing
meet
Bellatrix
Harry
did
not
see
what
happened
next
Kingsley
swayed
across
his
field
vision
battling
with
the
pockmarked
and
longer
masked
Rookwood
another
jet
green
light
flew
over
Harry
head
launched
himself
towards
Neville
Can
you
stand
bellowed
Neville
ear
Neville
legs
jerked
and
twitched
uncontrollably
Put
your
arm
round
neck
Neville
did
Harry
heaved
Neville
legs
were
still
flying
every
direction
they
would
not
support
him
and
then
out
nowhere
man
lunged
them
both
fell
backwards
Neville
legs
waving
wildly
like
overturned
beetle
Harry
with
his
left
arm
held
the
air
try
save
the
smallglass
ball
from
being
smashed
The
prophecy
give
the
prophecy
Potter
snarled
Lucius
Malfoy
voice
his
ear
and
Harry
felt
the
tip
Malfoy
wand
pressing
hard
between
his
ribs
get
off
Neville
catch
Harry
flung
the
prophecy
across
the
floor
Neville
span
himself
around
his
back
and
scooped
the
ball
his
chest
Malfoy
pointed
the
wand
instead
Neville
but
Harry
jabbed
his
own
wand
back
over
his
shoulder
and
yelled
Impedimenta
Malfoy
was
blasted
off
his
back
Harry
scrambled
again
looked
around
and
saw
Malfoy
smash
into
the
dais
which
Sirius
and
Bellatrix
were
now
duelling
Malfoy
aimed
his
wand
Harry
and
Neville
again
but
before
could
draw
breath
strike
Lupin
had
jumped
between
them
Harry
round
the
others
and
Harry
seized
Neville
the
shoulder
his
robes
and
lifted
him
bodily
the
first
tier
stone
steps
Neville
legs
twitched
and
jerked
and
would
not
support
his
weight
Harry
heaved
again
with
all
the
strength
possessed
and
they
climbed
another
step
spell
hit
the
stone
bench
Harry
heel
crumbled
away
and
fell
back
the
step
below
Neville
sank
the
ground
his
legs
still
jerking
and
thrashing
and
thrust
the
prophecy
into
his
pocket
Come
said
Harry
desperately
hauling
Neville
robes
Just
try
and
push
with
your
legs
gave
another
stupendous
heave
and
Neville
robes
tore
all
along
the
left
seam
the
small
spun
glass
ball
dropped
from
his
pocket
and
before
either
them
could
catch
one
Neville
floundering
feet
kicked
flew
some
ten
feet
their
right
and
smashed
the
step
beneath
them
both
them
stared
the
place
where
had
broken
appalled
what
had
happened
pearly
white
figure
with
hugely
magnified
eyes
rose
into
the
air
unnoticed
any
but
them
Harry
could
see
its
mouth
moving
but
all
the
crashes
and
screams
and
yells
surrounding
them
not
one
word
the
prophecy
could
hear
The
figure
stoppedspeaking
and
dissolved
into
nothingness
Harry
sorry
cried
Neville
his
face
anguished
his
legs
continued
flounder
sorry
Harry
didn
bean
doesn
matter
Harry
shouted
Just
try
and
stand
let
get
out
Dubbledore
said
Neville
his
sweaty
face
suddenly
transported
staring
over
Harry
shoulder
What
DUBBLEDORE
Harry
turned
look
where
Neville
was
staring
Directly
above
them
framed
the
doorway
from
the
Brain
Room
stood
Albus
Dumbledore
his
wand
aloft
his
face
white
and
furious
Harry
felt
kind
electric
charge
surge
through
every
particle
his
body
they
were
saved
Dumbledore
sped
down
the
steps
past
Neville
and
Harry
who
had
more
thoughts
leaving
Dumbledore
was
already
the
foot
the
steps
when
the
Death
Eaters
nearest
realised
was
there
and
yelled
the
others
One
the
Death
Eaters
ran
for
scrabbling
like
monkey
the
stone
steps
opposite
Dumbledore
spell
pulled
him
back
easily
and
effortlessly
though
had
hooked
him
with
invisible
line
Only
one
pair
was
still
battling
apparently
unaware
the
new
arrival
Harry
saw
Sirius
duck
Bellatrix
jet
red
light
was
laughing
her
Come
you
can
better
than
that
yelled
his
voice
echoing
around
the
cavernous
room
The
second
jet
light
hit
him
squarely
the
chest
The
laughter
had
not
quite
died
from
his
face
but
his
eyes
widened
shock
Harry
released
Neville
though
was
unaware
doing
was
jumping
down
the
steps
again
pulling
out
his
wand
Dumbledore
too
turned
towards
the
dais
seemed
take
Sirius
age
fall
his
body
curved
graceful
arc
sank
backwards
through
the
ragged
veil
hanging
from
the
arch
Harry
saw
the
look
mingled
fear
and
surprise
his
godfather
wasted
once
handsome
face
fell
through
the
ancient
doorway
and
disappeared
behind
the
veil
which
fluttered
for
moment
though
high
wind
then
fell
back
into
place
Harry
heard
Bellatrix
Lestrange
triumphant
scream
but
knew
meant
nothing
Sirius
had
only
just
fallen
through
the
archway
would
reappear
from
the
other
side
any
second
But
Sirius
did
not
reappear
SIRIUS
Harry
yelled
SIRIUS
had
reached
the
floor
his
breath
coming
searing
gasps
Sirius
must
just
behind
the
curtain
Harry
would
pull
him
back
out
But
reached
the
ground
and
sprinted
towards
the
dais
Lupin
grabbed
Harry
around
the
chest
holding
him
back
There
nothing
you
can
Harry
Get
him
save
him
only
just
gone
through
too
late
Harry
can
still
reach
him
Harry
struggled
hard
and
viciously
but
Lupin
would
not
let
There
nothing
you
can
Harry
nothing
gone
THE
ONLY
ONE
EVER
FEARED
hasn
gone
Harry
yelled
did
not
believe
would
not
believe
still
fought
Lupin
with
every
bit
strength
had
Lupin
did
not
understand
people
hid
behind
that
curtain
Harry
had
heard
them
whispering
the
first
time
had
entered
the
room
Sirius
was
hiding
simply
lurking
out
sight
SIRIUS
bellowed
SIRIUS
can
come
back
Harry
said
Lupin
his
voice
breaking
struggled
contain
Harry
can
come
back
because
NOT
DEAD
roared
Harry
SIRIUS
There
was
movement
going
around
them
pointless
bustling
the
flashes
more
spells
Harry
was
meaningless
noise
the
deflected
curses
flying
past
them
did
not
matter
nothing
mattered
except
that
Lupin
should
stop
pretending
that
Sirius
who
was
standing
feet
from
them
behind
that
old
curtain
was
not
going
emerge
any
moment
shaking
back
his
dark
hair
and
eager
enter
the
battle
Lupin
dragged
Harry
away
from
the
dais
Harry
still
staring
the
archway
was
angry
Sirius
now
for
keeping
him
waiting
But
some
part
him
realised
even
fought
break
free
from
Lupin
that
Sirius
had
never
kept
him
waiting
before
Sirius

Sirius
was
not
reappearing
out
that
archway
when
Harry
was
yelling
for
him
though
his
life
depended
the
only
possible
explanation
was
that

not

Neville
His

uncontrollably

Harry

Lupin
quietly
and

The

Bellatrix

SHE

Harry
SHE

And
was
off
scrambling
the
stone

people
were
shouting
behind
him
but
did
not

The

Bellatrix
robes
whipped
out

ahead
and
they
were
back
the

where
the
brains
were
swimming
She

The

Slipping

over
Luna

was
groaning
the

past
Ginny
who

Harry

Ron
who

feebly
and
Hermione
who

wrenched
open
the

into
the

and
saw
Bellatrix
disappearing
through

the

the

the
corridor
leading
back
the

but
she
had
slammed
the

and
the

were
already

Once

The

The

the

Harry

Atrium
The
doors
slid
shut
and
was
rising
forced
his
way
out
the
lift
before
the
grilles
were
fully
open
and
looked
around
Bellatrix
was
almost
the
telephone

the
other
end
the
hall
but
she
looked
back
sprinted
towards
her
and
aimed
another
spell
him
dodged
behind
the
Fountain
Magical
Brethren
the
spell
zoomed
past
him
and
hit
the
wroughtgold
gates
the
other
end
the
Atrium
that
they
rang
like
bells
There
were
more
footsteps
She
had
stopped
running
crouched
behind
the
statues
listening
Come
out
come
out
little
Harry
she
called
her
mock
baby
voice
which
echoed
off
the
polished
wooden
floors
What

Harry

Harry
such

never

flung
himself
out
from
behind
the

and
bellowed
Crucio
Bellatrix
screamed
the
spell
had
knocked
her
off
her
feet
but
she
did
not
writhe
and
shriek
with
pain
Neville
had
she
was
already
back
her
feet
breathless
longer
laughing
Harry
dodged
behind
the
golden
fountain
again
Her
counter
spell
hit
the
head
the
handsome
wizard
which
was
blown
off
and
landed
twenty
feet
away
gouging
long
scratches
into
the
wooden
floor
Never

Unforgivable
Curse
before

she
yelled
She
had
abandoned

Harry
was
edging
around
the
fountain
the
other
side
when
she
screamed
Crucio
and
was
forced
duck
down
again
the
centaur
arm
holding
its
bow
span
off
and
landed
with
crash
the
floor
short
distance
from
the
golden

Stupefy
yelled
Harry
had
edged
right
around
where
the
goblin
stood
beaming
the
now
headless
wizard
and
taken
aim
her
back
she
peered
around
the
fountain
She
reacted
fast
barely
had
time
duck
Protego
The
jet
red
light
his
own
Stunning
Spell
bounced
back
him
Harry
scrambled
back
behind
the
fountain
and
one
the
goblin
ears
went
flying
across
the
room
Potter
going
give
you
one
chance
shouted
Bellatrix
Give
the
prophecy
roll
out
towards
now
and
may
spare
your

Well

because

Harry
roared
and
shouted
pain
seared
across
his
forehead
his
scar
was
fire
again
and
felt
surge
fury
that
was
quite
unconnected
with
his
own
rage
And
knows
said
Harry
with
mad
laugh
match
Bellatrix
own
Your
dear
old
mate
Voldemort
knows
gone
not
going
happy
with
you
What
What
you
mean
she
cried
and
for
the
first
time
there
was
fear
her
voice
The
prophecy
smashed
when
was
trying
get
Neville
the
steps
What
you
think
Voldemort
say
about
that
then
His
scar
seared
and
burned
the
pain
was
making
his
eyes
stream
LIAR
she
shrieked
but
could
hear
the
terror
behind
the
anger
now
YOU
GOT
POTTER
AND
YOU
WILL
GIVE
Accio
prophecy
ACCIO
PROPHECY
Harry
laughed
again
because
knew
would
incense
her
the
pain
building
his
head
badly
thought
his
skull
might
burst
waved
his
empty
hand
from
behind
the
one
eared
goblin
and
withdrew
quickly
she
sent
another
jet
green
light
flying
him
Nothing
there
shouted
Nothing
summon
smashed
and
nobody
heard
what
said
tell
your
boss
that
she
screamed

MASTER

Don

Harry
his
eyes
screwed
against
the
pain
his
scar
now
more
terrible
than
ever
can
hear
you
from
here
Can
Potter
said
high
cold
voice
Harry
opened
his
eyes
Tall
thin
and
black
hooded
his
terrible
snakelike
face
white
and
gaunt
his
scarlet
slit
pupilled
eyes
staring
Lord
Voldemort
had
appeared
the
middle
the
hall
his
wand
pointing
Harry
who
stood
frozen
quite
unable

said
Voldemort
softly
staring
Harry
with
those
pitiless
red
eyes
Bella

the
truth
looking
from
within
his
worthless
mind
months

Death

Master

Bellatrix
flinging
herself
down
Voldemort
feet
paced
slowly
nearer
Master

Bella
said
Voldemort
dangerously

Ministry
Magic

snivelling
apologies
But
Master

Voldemort

nothing

Potter
said
quietly
You

irked
too
often
for
too
long
AVADA
KEDAVRA
Harry
had
not
even
opened
his
mouth
resist
his
mind
was
blank
his
wand
pointing
uselessly
the
floor
But
the
headless
golden
statue
the
wizard
the
fountain
had
sprung
alive
leaping
from
its
plinth
land
with
crash
the
floor
between
Harry
and
Voldemort
The
spell
merely
glanced
off
its
chest
the
statue
flung
out
its
arms
protect
Harry
What
cried
Voldemort
staring
around
And
then
breathed
Dumbledore
Harry
looked
behind
him
his
heart
pounding
Dumbledore
was
standing
front
the
golden
gates
Voldemort
raised
his
wand
and
another
jet
green
light
streaked
Dumbledore
who
turned
and
was
gone
whirling
his
cloak
Next
second
had
reappeared
behind
Voldemort
and
waved
his
wand
towards
the
remnants
the
fountain
The
other
statues
sprang
life
The
statue
the
witch
ran
Bellatrix
who
screamed
and
sent
spells
streaming
uselessly
off
its
chest
before
dived
her
pinning
her
the
floor
Meanwhile
the
goblin
and
the
house
elf
scuttled
towards
the
fireplaces
set
along
the
wall
and
the
one
armed
centaur
galloped
Voldemort
who
vanished
and
reappeared
beside
the
pool
The
headless
statue
thrust
Harry
backwards
away
from
the
fight
Dumbledore
advanced
Voldemort
and
the
golden
centaur
cantered
around
them
both
was
foolish
come
here
tonight
Tom
said
Dumbledore
calmly
The
Aurors
are
their
way
which
time
shall
gone
and
you
will
dead
spat
Voldemort
sent
another
killing
curse
Dumbledore
but
missed
instead
hitting
the
security
guard
desk
which
burst
into
flame
Dumbledore
flicked
his
own
wand
the
force
the
spell
that
emanated
from
was
such
that
Harry
though
shielded
his
golden
guard
felt
his
hair
stand
end
passed
and
this
time
Voldemort
was
forced
conjure
shining
silver
shield
out
thin
air
deflect
The
spell
whatever
was
caused
visible
damage
the
shield
though
deep
gong
like
note
reverberated
from
oddly
chilling
sound
You
not
seek
kill
Dumbledore
called
Voldemort
his
scarlet
eyes
narrowed
over
the
top
the
shield
Above
such
brutality
are
you
both
know
that
there
are
other
ways
destroying
man
Tom
Dumbledore
said
calmly
continuing
walk
towards
Voldemort
though
had
not
fear
the
world
though
nothing
had
happened
interrupt
his
stroll
the
hall
Merely
taking
your
life
would
not
satisfy
admit
There
nothing
worse
than
death
Dumbledore
snarled
Voldemort
You
are
quite
wrong
said
Dumbledore
still
closing
upon
Voldemort
and
speaking
lightly
though
they
were
discussing
the
matter
over
drinks
Harry
felt
scared
see
him
walking
along
undefended
shieldless
wanted
cry
out
warning
but
his
headless
guard
kept
shunting
him
backwards
towards
the
wall
blocking
his
every
attempt
get
out
from
behind
Indeed
your
failure
understand
that
there
are
things
much
worse
than
death
has
always
been
your
greatest
weakness
Another
jet
green
light
flew
from
behind
the
silver
shield
This
time
was
the
one
armed
centaur
galloping
front
Dumbledore
that
took
the
blast
and
shattered
into
hundred
pieces
but
before
the
fragments
had
even
hit
the
floor
Dumbledore
had
drawn
back
his
wand
and
waved
though
brandishing
whip
long
thin
flame
flew
from
the
tip
wrapped
itself
around
Voldemort
shield
and
all
For
moment
seemed
Dumbledore
had
won
but
then
the
fiery
rope
became
serpent
which
relinquished
its
hold
Voldemort
once
and
turned
hissing
furiously
face
Dumbledore
Voldemort
vanished
the
snake
reared
from
the
floor
ready
strike
There
was
burst
flame
midair
above
Dumbledore
just
Voldemort
reappeared
standing
the
plinth
the
middle
the
pool
where
recently
the
five
statues
had
stood
Look
out
Harry
yelled
But
even
shouted
another
jet
green
light
flew
Dumbledore
from
Voldemort
wand
and
the
snake
struck
Fawkes
swooped
down
front
Dumbledore
opened
his
beak
wide
and
swallowed
the
jet
green
light
whole
burst
into
flame
and
fell
the
floor
small
wrinkled
and
flightless
the
same
moment
Dumbledore
brandished
his
wand
one
long
fluid
movement
the
snake
which
had
been
instant
from
sinking
its
fangs
into
him
flew
high
into
the
air
and
vanished
wisp
dark
smoke
and
the
water
the
pool
rose
and
covered
Voldemort
like
cocoon
molten
glass
For
few
seconds
Voldemort
was
visible
only
dark
rippling
faceless
figure
shimmering
and
indistinct
upon
the
plinth
clearly
struggling
throw
off
the
suffocating
mass
Then
was
gone
and
the
water
fell
with
crash
back
into
its
pool
slopping
wildly
over
the
sides
drenching
the
polished
floor
MASTER
screamed
Bellatrix
Sure
was
over
sure
Voldemort
had
decided
flee
Harry
made
run
out
from
behind
his
statue
guard
but
Dumbledore
bellowed
Stay
where
you
are
Harry
For
the
first
time
Dumbledore
sounded
frightened
Harry
could
not
see
why
the
hall
was
quite
empty
but
for
themselves
the
sobbing
Bellatrix
still
trapped
under
the
witch
statue
and
the
baby
phoenix
Fawkes
croaking
feebly
the
floor
Then
Harry
scar
burst
open
and
knew
was
dead
was
pain
beyond
imagining
pain
past
endurance
was
gone
from
the
hall
was
locked
the
coils
creature
with
red
eyes
tightly
bound
that
Harry
did
not
know
where
his
body
ended
and
the
creature
began
they
were
fused
together
bound
pain
and
there
was
escape
And
when
the
creature
spoke
used
Harry
mouth
that
his
agony
felt
his
jaw
move
Kill
now
Dumbledore
Blinded
and
dying
every
part
him
screaming
for
release
Harry
felt
the
creature
use
him
again
death
nothing
Dumbledore
kill
the
boy
Let
the
pain
stop
thought
Harry
let
him
kill
end
Dumbledore
death
nothing
compared
this
And
see
Sirius
again
And
Harry
heart
filled
with
emotion
the
creature
coils
loosened
the
pain
was
gone
Harry
was
lying
face
down
the
floor
his
glasses
gone
shivering
though
lay
upon
ice
not
wood
And
there
were
voices
echoing
through
the
hall
more
voices
than
there
should
have
been
Harry
opened
his
eyes
saw
his
glasses
lying
the
heel
the
headless
statue
that
had
been
guarding
him
but
which
now
lay
flat
its
back
cracked
and
immobile
put
them
and
raised
his
head
little
find
Dumbledore
crooked
nose
inches
from
his
own
Are
you
all
right
Harry
Yes
said
Harry
shaking
violently
could
not
hold
his
head
properly
Yeah
where
Voldemort
where
who
are
all
these
what
The
Atrium
was
full
people
the
floor
was
reflecting
the
emerald
green
flames
that
had
burst
into
life
all
the
fireplaces
along
one
wall
and
streams
witches
and
wizards
were
emerging
from
them
Dumbledore
pulled
him
back
his
feet
Harry
saw
the
tiny
gold
statues
the
house
elf
and
the
goblin
leading
stunned
looking
Cornelius
Fudge
forward
was
there
shouted
scarlet
robed
man
with
ponytail
who
was
pointing
pile
golden
rubble
the
other
side
the
hall
where
Bellatrix
had
lain
trapped
only
moments
before
saw
him
Fudge
swear
was
You
Know
Who
grabbed
woman
and
Disapparated
know
Williamson
know
saw
him
too
gibbered
Fudge
who
was
wearing
pyjamas
under
his
pinstriped
cloak
and
was
gasping
though
had
just
run
miles
Merlin

here
here
the
Ministry
Magic
great
heavens
above
doesn
seem
possible
word
how
can
this
you
proceed
downstairs
into
the
Department
Mysteries
Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
apparently
satisfied
that
Harry
was
all
right
and
walking
forwards
that
the
newcomers
realised
was
there
for
the
first
time
few
them
raised
their
wands
others
simply
looked
amazed
the
statues
the
elf
and
goblin
applauded
and
Fudge
jumped
much
that
his
slipper
clad
feet
left
the
floor
you
will
find
several
escaped
Death
Eaters
contained
the
Death
Chamber
bound
Anti
Disapparation
Jinx
and
awaiting
your
decision
what
with
them
Dumbledore
gasped
Fudge
beside
himself
with
amazement
You
here
looked
wildly
around
the
Aurors
had
brought
with
him
and
could
not
have
been
clearer
that
was
half
mind
cry
Seize
him
Cornelius
ready
fight
your
men
and
win
again
said
Dumbledore
thunderous
voice
But
few
minutes
ago
yousaw
proof
with
your
own
eyes
that
have
been
telling
you
the
truth
for
year
Lord
Voldemort
has
returned

been
chasing
the
wrong
man
for
twelve
months
and
time
you
listened

blustered
Fudge
looking
around
though
hoping
somebody
was
going
tell
him
what
When
nobody
did
said
Very
well
Dawlish
Williamson
down
the
Department
Mysteries
and
see
Dumbledore
you
you
will
need
tell
exactly
the
Fountain
Magical
Brethren
what
happened
added
kind
whimper
staring
around
the
floor
where
the
remains
the
statues
the
witch
wizard
and
centaur
now
lay
scattered

discuss
that
after
have
sent
Harry
back
Hogwarts
said
Dumbledore
Harry
Harry
Potter
Fudge
wheeled
around
and
stared
Harry
who
was
still
standing
against
the
wall
beside
the
fallen
statue
that
had
guarded
him
during
Dumbledore
and
Voldemort
duel
here
said
Fudge
goggling
Harry
Why
what
all
this
about
shall
explain
everything
repeated
Dumbledore
when
Harry
back
school
walked
away
from
the
pool
the
place
where
the
golden
wizard
head
lay
the
floor
pointed
his
wand
and
muttered
Portus
The
head
glowed
blue
and
trembled
noisily
against
the
wooden
floor
for
few
seconds
then
became
still
once
more
Now
see
here
Dumbledore
said
Fudge
Dumbledore
picked
the
head
and
walked
back
Harry
carrying
You

got
authorisation
for
that
Portkey
You

that
right

Minister

Magic

His
voice
faltered
Dumbledore
surveyed
him
magisterially
over
his
half
moon
spectacles
You

give
the
order

Dolores
Umbridge
from

said
Dumbledore
You

pulled

with
twelve
hands
from
his
pocket
and
surveyed

hour
time
tonight

Hogwarts
Letters
addressed
the
Headmaster
will
find
Fudge
goggled
worse
than
ever
his
mouth
was
open
and
his
round
face
grew
pinker
under
his
rumpled
grey
hair
you
Dumbledore
turned
his
back
him
Take
this
Portkey
Harry
held
out
the
golden
head
the
statue
and
Harry
placed
his
hand
past
caring
what
did
next
where
went
shall
see
you
half
hour
said
Dumbledore
quietly
One
two
three
Harry
felt
the
familiar
sensation
hook
being
jerked
behind
his
navel
The
polished
wooden
floor
was
gone
from
beneath
his
feet
the
Atrium
Fudge
and
Dumbledore
had
all
disappeared
and
was
flying
forwards
whirlwind
colour
and
sound
THE
LOST
PROPHECY
Harry
feet
hit
solid
ground
his
knees
buckled
little
and
the
golden
wizard
head
fell
with
resoundingclunk
the
floor
looked
around
and
saw
that
had
arrived
Dumbledore
office
Everything
seemed
have
repaired
itself
during
the
Headmaster
absence
The
delicate
silver
instruments
stood
once
more
the
spindle
legged
tables
puffing
and
whirring
serenely
The
portraits
the
headmasters
and
headmistresses
were
snoozing
their
frames
heads
lolling
back
armchairs
against
the
edge
the
picture
Harry
looked
through
the
window
There
was
cool
line
pale
green
along
the
horizon
dawn
was
approaching
The
silence
and
the
stillness
broken
only
the
occasional
grunt
snuffle
sleeping
portrait
was
unbearable
him
his
surroundings
could
have
reflected
the
feelings
inside
him
the
pictures
would
have
been
screaming
pain
walked
around
the
quiet
beautiful
office
breathing
quickly
trying
not
think
But
had
think
there
was
escape
was
his
fault
Sirius
had
died
was
all
his
fault
Harry
had
not
been
stupid
enough
fall
for
Voldemort
trick
had
not
been
convinced
that
what
had
seen
his
dream
was
real
had
only
opened
his
mind
the
possibility
that
Voldemort
was
Hermione
had
said
banking
Harry
slove
playing
the
hero
was
unbearable
would
not
think
about
could
not
stand
there
was
terrible
hollow
inside
him
did
not
want
feel
examine
dark
hole
where
Sirius
had
been
where
Sirius
had
vanished
did
not
want
have
alone
with
that
great
silent
space
could
not
stand
picture
behind
him
gave
particularly
loud
grunting
snore
and
cool
voice
said
Harry
Potter
Phineas
Nigellus
gave
long
yawn
stretching
his
arms
surveyed
Harry
out
shrewd
narrow
eyes
And
what
brings
you
here
the
early
hours
the
morning
said
Phineas
eventually
This
office
supposed
barred
all
but
the
rightful
Headmaster
has
Dumbledore
sent
you
here
don
tell
gave
another
shuddering
yawn
Another
message
for
worthless
great
great
grandson
Harry
could
not
speak
Phineas
Nigellus
did
not
know
that
Sirius
was
dead
but
Harry
could
not
tell
him
say
aloud
would
make
final
absolute
irretrievable
few
more
the
portraits
had
stirred
now
Terror
being
interrogated
made
Harry
stride
across
the
room
and
seize
the
doorknob
would
not
turn
was
shut
hope
this
means
said
the
corpulent
red
nosed
wizard
who
hung
the
wall
behind
the
Headmaster
desk
that
Dumbledore
will
soon
back
among
Harry
turned
The
wizard
was
surveying
him
with
great
interest
Harry
nodded
tugged
again
the
doorknob
behind
his
back
but
remained
immovable
good
said
the
wizard
has
been
very
dull
without
him
very
dull
indeed
settled
himself
the
throne
like
chair
which
had
been
painted
and
smiled
benignly
upon
Harry
Dumbledore
thinks
very
highly
you
sure
you
know
said
comfortably
yes
Holds
you
great
esteem
The
guilt
filling
the
whole
Harry
chest
like
some
monstrous
weighty
parasite
now
writhed
and
squirmed
Harry
could
not
stand
this
could
not
stand
being
himself
any
more
had
never
felt
more
trapped
inside
his
own
head
and
body
never
wished
intensely
that
could
somebody
anybody
else
The
empty
fireplace
burst
into
emerald
green
flame
making
Harry
leap
away
from
the
door
staring
the
man
spinning
inside
the
grate
Dumbledore
tall
form
unfolded
itself
from
the
fire
the
wizards
and
witches
the
surrounding
walls
jerked
awake
many
them
giving
cries
welcome
Thank
you
said
Dumbledore
softly
did
not
look
Harry
first
but
walked
over
the
perch
beside
the
door
and
withdrew
from
inside
pocket
his
robes
the
tiny
ugly
featherless
Fawkes
whom
placed
gently
the
tray
soft
ashes
beneath
the
golden
post
where
the
full
grown
Fawkes
usually
stood
Well
Harry
said
Dumbledore
finally
turning
away
from
the
baby
bird
you
will
pleased
hear
that
none
your
fellow
students
are
going
suffer
lasting
damage
from
the
night
events
Harry
tried
say
Good
but
sound
came
out
seemed
him
that
Dumbledore
was
reminding
him
the
amount
damage
had
caused
and
although
Dumbledore
was
for
once
looking
him
directly
and
although
his
expression
was
kindly
rather
than
accusatory
Harry
could
not
bear
meet
his
eyes
Madam
Pomfrey
patching
everybody
said
Dumbledore
Nymphadora
Tonks
may
need
spend
little
time
Mungo
but
seems
she
will
make
full
recovery
Harry
contented
himself
with
nodding
the
carpet
which
was
growing
lighter
the
sky
outside
grew
paler
was
sure
all
the
portraits
around
the
room
were
listening
closely
every
word
Dumbledore
spoke
wondering
where
Dumbledore
and
Harry
had
been
and
why
there
had
been
injuries
know
how
you
feeling
Harry
said
Dumbledore
very
quietly
you
don
said
Harry
and
his
voice
was
suddenly
loud
and
strong
white
hot
anger
leapt
inside
him
Dumbledore
knewnothing
about
his
feelings
You
see
Dumbledore
said
Phineas
Nigellus
slyly
Never
try
understand
the
students
They
hate
They
would
much
rather
tragically
misunderstood
wallow
self
pity
stew
their
own
That
enough
Phineas
said
Dumbledore
Harry
turned
his
back
Dumbledore
and
stared
determinedly
out
the
window
could
see
the
Quidditch
stadium
the
distance
Sirius
had
appeared
there
once
disguised
the
shaggy
black
dog
could
watch
Harry
play
had
probably
come
see
whether
Harry
was
good
James
had
been
Harry
had
never
asked
him
There
shame
what
you
are
feeling
Harry
said
Dumbledore
voice
the
contrary
the
fact
that
you
can
feel
pain
like
this
your
greatest
strength
Harry
felt
the
white
hot
anger
lick
his
insides
blazing
the
terrible
emptiness
filling
him
with
the
desire
hurt
Dumbledore
for
his
calmness
and
his
empty
words
greatest
strength
said
Harry
his
voice
shaking
stared
out
the
Quidditch
stadium
longer
seeing
You
haven
got
clue
you
don
know
What
don
know
asked
Dumbledore
calmly
was
too
much
Harry
turned
around
shaking
with
rage
don
want
talk
about
how
feel
all
right
Harry
suffering
like
this
proves
you
are
still
man
This
pain
part
being
human
THEN
DON
WANT
HUMAN
Harry
roared
and
seized
the
delicate
silver
instrument
from
the
spindlelegged
table
beside
him
and
flung
across
the
room
shattered
into
hundred
tiny
pieces
against
the
wall
Several
the
pictures
let
out
yells
anger
and
fright
and
the
portrait
Armando
Dippet
said
Really
DON
CARE
Harry
yelled
them
snatching
lunascope
and
throwing
into
the
fireplace
HAD
ENOUGH
SEEN
ENOUGH
WANT
OUT
WANT
END
DON
CARE
ANY
MORE
seized
the
table
which
the
silver
instrument
had
stood
and
threw
that
too
broke
apart
the
floor
and
the
legs
rolled
different
directions
You
care
said
Dumbledore
had
not
flinched
made
single
move
stop
Harry
demolishing
his
office
His
expression
was
calm
almost
detached
You
care
much
you
feel
though
you
will
bleed
death
with
the
pain
DON
Harry
screamed
loudly
that
felt
his
throat
might
tear
and
for
second
wanted
rush
Dumbledore
and
break
him
too
shatter
that
calm
old
face
shake
him
hurt
him
make
him
feel
some
tiny
part
the
horror
inside
himself
yes
you
said
Dumbledore
still
more
calmly
You
have
now
lost
your
mother
your
father
and
the
closest
thing
parent
you
have
ever
known
course
you
care
YOU
DON
KNOW
HOW
FEEL
Harry
roared
YOU
STANDING
THERE
YOU
But
words
were
longer
enough
smashing
things
was
more
help
wanted
run
wanted
keep
running
and
never
look
back
wanted
somewhere
could
not
see
the
clear
blue
eyes
staring
him
that
hatefully
calm
old
face
turned
his
heel
and
ran
the
door
seized
the
doorknob
again
and
wrenched
But
the
door
would
not
open
Harry
turned
back
Dumbledore
Let
out
said
was
shaking
from
head
foot
said
Dumbledore
simply
For
few
seconds
they
stared
each
other
Let
out
Harry
said
again
Dumbledore
repeated
you
don
you
keep
here
you
don
let
all
means
continue
destroying
possessions
said
Dumbledore
serenely
daresay
have
too
many
walked
around
his
desk
and
sat
down
behind
watching
Harry
Let
out
Harry
said
yet
again
voice
that
was
cold
and
almost
calm
Dumbledore
Not
until
have
had
say
said
Dumbledore
you
you
think
want
you
think
give
DON
CARE
WHAT
YOU
GOT
SAY
Harry
roared
don
want
hearanything
you
got
say
You
will
said
Dumbledore
steadily
Because
you
are
not
nearly
angry
with
you
ought
you
are
attack
know
you
are
close
doing
would
like
have
thoroughly
earned
What
are
you
talking
ismy
fault
that
Sirius
died
said
Dumbledore
clearly
should
say
almost
entirely
fault
will
not
arrogant
claim
responsibility
for
the
whole
Sirius
was
brave
clever
and
energetic
man
and
such
men
are
not
usually
content
sit
home
hiding
while
they
believe
others
danger
Nevertheless
you
should
never
have
believed
for
instant
that
there
was
any
necessity
for
you
the
Department
Mysteries
tonight
had
been
open
with
you
Harry
should
have
been
you
would
have
known
long
time
ago
that
Voldemort
might
try
and
lure
you
the
Department
Mysteries
and
you
would
never
have
been
tricked
into
going
there
tonight
And
Sirius
would
not
have
had
come
after
you
That
blame
lies
with
and
with
alone
Harry
was
still
standing
with
his
hand
the
doorknob
but
was
unaware
was
gazing
Dumbledore
hardly
breathing
listening
yet
barely
understanding
what
was
hearing
Please
sit
down
said
Dumbledore
was
not
order
was
request
Harry
hesitated
then
walked
slowly
across
the
room
now
littered
with
silver
cogs
and
fragments
wood
and
took
the
seat
facing
Dumbledore
desk
understand
said
Phineas
Nigellus
slowly
from
Harry
left
that
great
great
grandson
the
last
the
Blacks
dead
Yes
Phineas
said
Dumbledore
don
believe
said
Phineas
brusquely
Harry
turned
his
head
time
see
Phineas
marching
out
his
portrait
and
knew
that
had
gone
visit
his
other
painting
Grimmauld
Place
would
walk
perhaps
from
portrait
portrait
calling
for
Sirius
through
the
house
Harry
owe
you
explanation
said
Dumbledore
explanation
old
man
mistakes
For
see
now
that
what
have
done
and
not
done
with
regard
you
bears
all
the
hallmarks
the
failings
age
Youth
cannot
know
how
age
thinks
and
feels
But
old
men
are
guilty
they
forget
what
was
young
and
seem
have
forgotten
lately
The
sun
was
rising
properly
now
there
was
rim
dazzling
orange
visible
over
the
mountains
and
the
sky
above
was
colourless
and
bright
The
light
fell
upon
Dumbledore
upon
the
silver
his
eyebrows
and
beard
upon
the
lines
gouged
deeply
into
his
face
guessed
fifteen
years
ago
said
Dumbledore
when
saw
the
scar
your
forehead
what
might
mean
guessed
that
might
the
sign
connection
forged
between
you
and
Voldemort
You
told
this
before
Professor
said
Harry
bluntly
did
not
care
about
being
rude
did
not
care
about
anything
very
much
any
more
Yes
said
Dumbledore
apologetically
Yes
but
you
see
necessary
start
with
your
scar
For
became
apparent
shortly
after
you
rejoined
the
magical
world
that
was
correct
and
that
your
scar
was
giving
you
warnings
when
Voldemort
was
close
you
else
feeling
powerful
emotion
know
said
Harry
wearily
And
this
ability
yours
detect
Voldemort
presence
even
when
disguised
and
know
what
feeling
when
his
emotions
are
roused
has
become
more
and
more
pronounced
since
Voldemort
returned
his
own
body
and
his
full
powers
Harry
did
not
bother
nod
knew
all
this
already
More
recently
said
Dumbledore
became
concerned
that
Voldemort
might
realise
that
this
connection
between
you
exists
Sure
enough
there
came
time
when
you
entered
far
into
his
mind
and
thoughts
that
sensed
your
presence
speaking
course
the
night
when
you
witnessedthe
attack
Weasley
Yeah
Snape
told
Harry
muttered
Professor
Snape
Harry
Dumbledore
corrected
him
quietly
But
did
you
not
wonder
why
was
not
who
explained
this
you
Why
did
not
teach
you
Occlumency
Why
had
not
much
looked
you
for
months
Harry
looked
could
see
now
that
Dumbledore
looked
sad
and
tired
Yeah
Harry
mumbled
Yeah
wondered
You
see
Dumbledore
continued
believed
could
not
long
before
Voldemort
attempted
force
his
way
into
your
mind
manipulate
and
misdirect
your
thoughts
and
was
not
eager
give
him
more
incentives
was
sure
that
realised
that
our
relationship
was
had
ever
been
closer
than
that
headmaster
and
pupil
would
seize
his
chance
use
you
means
spy
feared
the
uses
which
would
put
you
the
possibility
that
might
try
and
possess
you
Harry
believe
was
right
think
that
Voldemort
would
have
made
use
you
such
way
those
rare
occasions
when
had
close
contact
thought
saw
shadow
him
stir
behind
your
eyes
Harry
remembered
the
feeling
that
dormant
snake
had
risen
him
ready
strike
those
moments
when
and
Dumbledore
had
made
eye
contact
Voldemort
aim
possessing
you
demonstrated
tonight
would
not
have
been
destruction
would
have
been
yours
hoped
when
possessed
you
briefly
short
while
ago
that
would
sacrifice
you
the
hope
killing
him
you
see
have
been
trying
distancing
myself
from
you
protect
you
Harry
old
man
mistake
sighed
deeply
Harry
was
letting
the
words
wash
over
him
would
have
been
interested
know
all
this
few
months
ago
but
now
was
meaningless
compared
the
gaping
chasm
inside
him
that
was
the
loss
Sirius
none
mattered
Sirius
told
you
felt
Voldemort
awake
inside
you
the
very
night
that
you
had
the
vision
Arthur
Weasley
attack
knew
once
that
worst
fears
were
correct
Voldemort
had
realised
could
use
you
attempt
arm
you
against
Voldemort
assaults
your
mind
arranged
Occlumency
lessons
with
Professor
Snape
paused
Harry
watched
the
sunlight
which
was
sliding
slowly
across
the
polished
surface
Dumbledore
desk
illuminate
silver
ink
pot
and
handsome
scarlet
quill
Harry
could
tell
that
the
portraits
all
around
them
were
awake
and
listening
raptly
Dumbledore
explanation
could
hear
the
occasional
rustle
robes
the
slight
clearing
throat
Phineas
Nigellus
had
still
not
returned
Professor
Snape
discovered
Dumbledore
resumed
that
you
had
been
dreaming
about
the
door
the
Department
Mysteries
for
months
Voldemort
course
had
been
obsessed
with
the
possibility
hearing
the
prophecy
ever
since
regained
his
body
and
dwelled
the
door
did
you
though
you
did
not
know
what
meant
And
then
you
saw
Rookwood
who
worked
the
Department
Mysteries
before
his
arrest
telling
Voldemort
what
had
known
all
along
that
the
prophecies
held
the
Ministry
Magic
are
heavily
protected
Only
the
people
whom
they
refer
can
lift
them
from
the
shelves
without
suffering
madness
this
case
either
Voldemort
himself
would
have
enter
the
Ministry
Magic
and
risk
revealing
himself
last
else
you
would
have
take
for
him
became
matter
even
greater
urgency
that
you
should
master
Occlumency
But
didn
muttered
Harry
said
aloud
try
and
ease
the
dead
weight
guilt
inside
him
confession
must
surely
relieve
some
the
terrible
pressure
squeezing
his
heart
didn
practise
didn
bother
could
stopped
myself
having
those
dreams
Hermione
kept
telling
had
never
have
been
able
show
where
and
Sirius
wouldn
Sirius
wouldn
Something
was
erupting
inside
Harry
head
need
justify
himself
explain
tried
check
really
taken
Sirius
went
Umbridge
office
spoke
Kreacher
the
fire
and
said
Sirius
wasn
there
said
gone
Kreacher
lied
said
Dumbledore
calmly
You
are
not
his
master
could
lie
you
without
even
needing
punish
himself
Kreacher
intended
you
the
Ministry
Magic
sent
purpose
yes
Kreacher
afraid
has
been
serving
more
than
one
master
for
months
How
said
Harry
blankly
hasn
been
out
Grimmauld
Place
for
years
Kreacher
seized
his
opportunity
shortly
before
Christmas
said
Dumbledore
when
Sirius
apparently
shouted
him
get
out
took
Sirius
his
word
and
interpreted
this
order
leave
the
house
went
the
only
Black
family
member
for
whom
had
any
respect
left
Black
cousin
Narcissa
sister
Bellatrix
and
wife
Lucius
Malfoy
How
you
know
all
this
Harry
said
His
heart
was
beating
very
fast
felt
sick
remembered
worrying
about
Kreacher
odd
absence
over
Christmas
remembered
him
turning
again
the
attic
Kreacher
told
last
night
said
Dumbledore
You
see
when
you
gave
Professor
Snape
that
cryptic
warning
realised
that
you
had
had
vision
Sirius
trapped
the
bowels
the
Department
Mysteries
like
you
attempted
contact
Sirius
once
should
explain
that
members
the
Order
the
Phoenix
have
more
reliable
methods
communicating
than
the
fire
Dolores
Umbridge
office
Professor
Snape
found
that
Sirius
was
alive
and
safe
Grimmauld
Place
When
however
you
did
not
return
from
your
trip
into
the
Forest
with
Dolores
Umbridge
Professor
Snape
grew
worried
that
you
still
believed
Sirius
captive
Lord
Voldemort
alerted
certain
Order
members
once
Dumbledore
heaved
great
sigh
and
continued
Alastor
Moody
Nymphadora
Tonks
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
and
Remus
Lupin
were
Headquarters
when
made
contact
All
agreed
your
aid
once
Professor
Snape
requested
that
Sirius
remain
behind
needed
somebody
remain
Headquarters
tell
what
had
happened
for
was
due
there
any
moment
the
meantime
Professor
Snape
intended
search
the
Forest
for
you
But
Sirius
did
not
wish
remain
behind
while
the
others
went
search
for
you
delegated
Kreacher
the
task
telling
what
had
happened
And
was
that
when
arrived
Grimmauld
Place
shortly
after
they
had
all
left
for
the
Ministry
was
the
elf
who
told
laughing
fit
toburst
where
Sirius
had
gone
was
laughing
said
Harry
hollow
voice
yes
said
Dumbledore
You
see
Kreacher
was
not
able
betray
totally
not
Secret
Keeper
for
the
Order
could
not
give
the
Malfoys
our
whereabouts
tell
them
any
the
Order
confidential
plans
that
had
been
forbidden
reveal
was
bound
the
enchantments
his
kind
which
say
that
could
not
disobey
direct
order
from
his
master
Sirius
But
gave
Narcissa
information
the
sort
that
very
valuable
Voldemort
yet
must
have
seemed
much
too
trivial
for
Sirius
think
banning
him
from
repeating
Like
what
said
Harry
Like
the
fact
that
the
person
Sirius
cared
most
about
the
world
was
you
said
Dumbledore
quietly
Like
the
fact
that
you
were
coming
regard
Sirius
mixture
father
and
brother
Voldemort
knew
already
course
that
Sirius
was
the
Order
and
that
you
knew
where
was
butKreacher
information
made
him
realise
that
the
one
person
for
whom
you
would
any
lengths
rescue
was
Sirius
Black
Harry
lips
were
cold
and
numb
when
asked
Kreacher
Sirius
was
there
last
night
The
Malfoys
undoubtedly
Voldemort
instructions
had
told
him
must
find
way
keeping
Sirius
out
the
way
once
you
had
seen
the
vision
Sirius
being
tortured
Then
you
decided
check
whether
Sirius
was
home
not
Kreacher
would
able
pretend
was
not
Kreacher
injured
Buckbeak
the
Hippogriff
yesterday
and
the
moment
when
you
made
your
appearance
the
fire
Sirius
was
upstairs
tending
him
There
seemed
very
little
air
Harry
lungs
his
breathing
was
quick
and
shallow
And
Kreacher
told
you
all
this
and
laughed
croaked
did
not
wish
tell
said
Dumbledore
But
sufficiently
accomplished
Legilimens
myself
know
when
being
lied
and
persuaded
him
tell
the
full
story
before
left
for
the
Department
Mysteries
And
whispered
Harry
his
hands
curled
cold
fists
his
knees
and
Hermione
kept
telling
nice
him
She
was
quite
right
Harry
said
Dumbledore
warned
Sirius
when
adopted
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
our
Headquarters
that
Kreacher
must
treated
with
kindness
and
respect
also
told
him
that
Kreacher
could
dangerous
not
think
Sirius
took
very
seriously
that
ever
saw
Kreacher
being
with
feelings
acute
human
Don
you
blame
don
you
talk
about
Sirius
like
Harry
breath
was
constricted
could
not
get
the
words
out
properly
but
the
rage
that
had
subsided
briefly
flared
him
again
would
not
let
Dumbledore
criticise
Sirius
Kreacher
lying
foul
deserved
Kreacher
what
has
been
made
wizards
Harry
said
Dumbledore
Yes
pitied
His
existence
has
been
miserable
your
friend
Dobby
was
forced
Sirius
bidding
because
Sirius
was
the
last
the
family
which
was
enslaved
but
felt
true
loyalty
him
And
whatever
Kreacher
faults
must
admitted
that
Sirius
did
nothing
make
Kreacher
lot
easier
DON
TALK
ABOUT
SIRIUS
LIKE
THAT
Harry
yelled
was
his
feet
again
furious
ready
fly
Dumbledore
who
had
plainly
not
understood
Sirius
all
how
brave
was
how
much
had
suffered
What
about
Snape
Harry
spat
You
not
talking
about
him
are
you
When
told
him
Voldemort
had
Sirius
just
sneered
usual
Harry
you
know
Professor
Snape
had
choice
but
pretend
not
take
you
seriously
front
Dolores
Umbridge
said
Dumbledore
steadily
but
have
explained
informed
the
Order
soon
possible
about
what
you
had
said
was
who
deduced
where
you
had
gone
when
you
did
not
return
from
the
Forest
was
too
who
gave
Professor
Umbridge
fake
Veritaserum
when
she
was
attempting
force
you
tell
her
Sirius
whereabouts
Harry
disregarded
this
felt
savage
pleasure
blaming
Snape
seemed
easing
his
own
sense
dreadful
guilt
and
wanted
hear
Dumbledore
agree
with
him
Snape
Snape
goaded
Sirius
about
staying
the
house
made
out
Sirius
was
coward
Sirius
was
much
too
old
and
clever
have
allowed
such
feeble
taunts
hurt
him
said
Dumbledore
Snape
stopped
giving
Occlumency
lessons
Harry
snarled
threw
out
his
office
aware
said
Dumbledore
heavily
have
already
said
that
was
mistake
for
not
teach
you
myself
though
was
sure
the
time
that
nothing
could
have
been
more
dangerous
than
open
your
mind
even
further
Voldemort
while
presence
Snape
made
worse
scar
always
hurt
worse
after
lessons
with
him
Harry
remembered
Ron
thoughts
the
subject
and
plunged
how
you
know
wasn
trying
soften
for
Voldemort
make
easier
for
him
get
inside
trust
Severus
Snape
said
Dumbledore
simply
But
forgot
another
old
man
mistake
that
some
wounds
run
too
deep
for
the
healing
thought
Professor
Snape
could
overcome
his
feelings
about
your
father
was
wrong
But
that
yelled
Harry
ignoring
the
scandalised
faces
and
disapproving
mutterings
the
portraits
the
walls
for
Snape
hate
dad
but
not
for
Sirius
hate
Kreacher
Sirius
did
not
hate
Kreacher
said
Dumbledore
regarded
him
servant
unworthy
much
interest
notice
Indifference
and
neglect
often
much
more
damage
than
outright
dislike
the
fountain
destroyed
tonight
told
lie
wizards
have
mistreated
and
abused
our
fellows
for
too
long
and
are
now
reaping
our
reward
SIRIUS
DESERVED
WHAT
GOT
DID
Harry
yelled
did
not
say
that
nor
will
you
ever
hear
say
Dumbledore
replied
quietly
Sirius
was
not
cruel
man
was
kind
houseelves
general
had
love
for
Kreacher
because
Kreacher
was
living
reminder
the
home
Sirius
had
hated
Yeah
did
hate
said
Harry
his
voice
cracking
turning
his
back
Dumbledore
and
walking
away
The
sun
was
bright
inside
the
room
now
and
the
eyes
all
the
portraits
followed
him
walked
without
realising
what
was
doing
without
seeing
the
office
all
You
made
him
stay
shut
that
house
and
hated
that
why
wanted
get
out
last
night
was
trying
keep
Sirius
alive
said
Dumbledore
quietly
People
don
like
being
locked
Harry
said
furiously
rounding
him
You
did
all
last
summer
Dumbledore
closed
his
eyes
and
buried
his
face
his
longfingered
hands
Harry
watched
him
but
this
uncharacteristic
sign
exhaustion
sadness
whatever
was
from
Dumbledore
did
not
soften
him
the
contrary
felt
even
angrier
that
Dumbledore
was
showing
signs
weakness
had
business
being
weak
when
Harry
wanted
rage
and
storm
him
Dumbledore
lowered
his
hands
and
surveyed
Harry
through
his
half
moon
glasses
time
said
for
tell
you
what
should
have
told
you
five
years
ago
Harry
Please
sit
down
going
tell
you
everything
ask
only
little
patience
You
will
have
your
chance
rage
whatever
you
like
when
have
finished
will
not
stop
you
Harry
glared
him
for
moment
then
flung
himself
back
into
the
chair
opposite
Dumbledore
and
waited
Dumbledore
stared
for
moment
the
sunlit
grounds
outside
the
window
then
looked
back
Harry
and
said
Five
years
ago
you
arrived
Hogwarts
Harry
safe
and
whole
had
planned
and
intended
Well
not
quite
whole
You
had
suffered
knew
you
would
when
left
you
your
aunt
and
uncle
doorstep
knew
was
condemning
you
ten
dark
and
difficult
years
paused
Harry
said
nothing
You
might
ask
and
with
good
reason
why
had
Why
could
some
wizarding
family
not
have
taken
you
Many
would
have
done
more
than
gladly
would
have
been
honoured
and
delighted
raise
you
son
answer
that
priority
was
keep
you
alive
You
were
more
danger
than
perhaps
anyone
but
realised
Voldemort
had
been
vanquished
hours
before
but
his
supporters
and
many
them
are
almost
terrible
were
still
large
angry
desperate
and
violent
And
had
make
decision
too
with
regard
the
years
ahead
Did
believe
that
Voldemort
was
gone
for
ever
knew
not
whether
would
ten
twenty
fifty
years
before
returned
but
was
sure
would
and
was
sure
too
knowing
him
have
done
that
would
not
rest
until
killed
you
knew
that
Voldemort
knowledge
magic
perhaps
more
extensive
than
any
wizard
alive
knew
that
even
most
complex
and
powerful
protective
spells
and
charms
were
unlikely
invincible
ever
returned
full
power
But
knew
too
where
Voldemort
was
weak
And
made
decision
You
would
protected
ancient
magic
which
knows
which
despises
and
which
has
always
therefore
underestimated
his
cost
speaking
course
the
fact
that
your
mother
died
save
you
She
gave
you
lingering
protection
never
expected
protection
that
flows
your
veins
this
day
put
trust
therefore
your
mother
blood
delivered
you
her
sister
her
only
remaining
relative
She
doesn
love
said
Harry
once
She
doesn
give
damn
But
she
took
you
Dumbledore
cut
across
him
She
may
have
taken
you
grudgingly
furiously
unwillingly
bitterly
yet
still
she
took
you
and
doing
she
sealed
the
charm
placed
upon
you
Your
mother
sacrifice
made
the
bond
blood
the
strongest
shield
could
give
you
still
don
While
you
can
still
call
home
the
place
where
your
mother
blood
dwells
there
you
cannot
touched
harmed
Voldemort
shed
her
blood
but
lives
you
and
her
sister
Her
blood
became
your
refuge
You
need
return
there
only
once
year
but
long
you
can
still
call
home
whilst
you
are
there
cannot
hurt
you
Your
aunt
knows
this
explained
what
had
done
the
letter
left
with
you
her
doorstep
She
knows
that
allowing
you
houseroom
may
well
have
kept
you
alive
for
the
past
fifteen
years
Wait
said
Harry
Wait
moment
sat
straighter
his
chair
staring
Dumbledore
You
sent
that
Howler
You
told
her
remember
was
your
voice
thought
said
Dumbledore
inclining
his
head
slightly
that
she
might
need
reminding
the
pact
she
had
sealed
taking
you
suspected
the
Dementor
attack
might
have
awoken
her
the
dangers
having
you
surrogate
son
did
said
Harry
quietly
Well
uncle
more
than
her
wanted
chuck
out
but
after
the
Howler
came
she
she
said
had
stay
stared
the
floor
for
moment
then
said
But
what
this
got
with
could
not
say
Sirius
name
Five
years
ago
then
continued
Dumbledore
though
had
not
paused
his
story
you
arrived
Hogwarts
neither
happy
nor
well
nourished
would
have
liked
perhaps
yet
alive
and
healthy
You
were
not
pampered
little
prince
but
normal
boy
could
have
hoped
under
the
circumstances
Thus
far
plan
was
working
well
And
then
well
you
will
remember
the
events
your
first
year
Hogwarts
quite
clearly
You
rose
magnificently
the
challenge
that
faced
you
and
sooner
much
sooner
than
had
anticipated
you
found
yourself
face
face
with
Voldemort
You
survived
again
You
did
more
You
delayed
his
return
full
power
and
strength
You
fought
man
fight
was
prouder
you
than
can
say
Yet
there
was
flaw
this
wonderful
plan
mine
said
Dumbledore
obvious
flaw
that
knew
even
then
might
the
undoing
all
And
yet
knowing
how
important
was
that
plan
should
succeed
told
myself
that
would
not
permit
this
flaw
ruin
alone
could
preventthis
alone
must
strong
And
here
was
first
test
you
lay
the
hospital
wing
weak
from
your
struggle
with
Voldemort
don
understand
what
you
saying
said
Harry
Don
you
remember
asking
you
lay
the
hospital
wing
why
Voldemort
had
tried
kill
you
when
you
were
baby
Harry
nodded
Ought
have
told
you
then
Harry
stared
into
the
blue
eyes
and
said
nothing
but
his
heart
was
racing
again
You
not
see
the
flaw
the
plan
yet
perhaps
not
Well
you
know
decided
not
answer
you
Eleven
told
myself
was
much
too
young
know
had
never
intended
tell
you
when
you
were
eleven
The
knowledge
would
too
much
such
young
age
should
have
recognised
the
danger
signs
then
should
have
asked
myself
why
did
not
feel
more
disturbed
that
you
had
already
asked
the
question
which
knew
one
day
must
give
terrible
answer
should
have
recognised
that
was
too
happy
think
that
did
not
have
that
particular
day
You
were
too
young
much
too
young
And
entered
your
second
year
Hogwarts
And
once
again
you
met
challenges
even
grown
wizards
have
never
faced
once
again
you
acquitted
yourself
beyond
wildest
dreams
You
did
not
ask
again
however
why
Voldemort
had
left
that
mark
you
discussed
your
scar
yes
camevery
very
close
the
subject
Why
did
not
tell
you
everything
Well
seemed
that
twelve
was
after
all
hardly
better
than
eleven
receive
such
information
allowed
you
leave
presence
bloodstained
exhausted
but
exhilarated
and
felt
twinge
unease
that
ought
perhaps
have
told
you
then
was
swiftly
silenced
You
were
still
young
you
see
and
could
not
find
myself
spoil
that
night
triumph
you
see
Harry
you
see
the
flaw
brilliant
plan
now
had
fallen
into
the
trap
had
foreseen
that
had
told
myself
could
avoid
that
must
avoid
don
cared
about
you
too
much
said
Dumbledore
simply
cared
more
for
your
happiness
than
your
knowing
the
truth
more
for
your
peace
mind
than
plan
more
for
your
life
than
the
lives
that
might
lost
the
plan
failed
other
words
acted
exactly
Voldemort
expects
fools
who
love
act
there
defence
defy
anyone
who
has
watched
you
have
and
have
watched
you
more
closely
than
you
can
have
imagined
not
want
save
you
more
pain
than
you
had
already
suffered
What
did
care
numbers
nameless
and
faceless
people
and
creatures
were
slaughtered
the
vague
future
the
here
and
now
you
were
alive
and
well
and
happy
never
dreamed
that
would
have
such
person
hands
entered
your
third
year
watched
from
afar
you
struggled
repel
Dementors
you
found
Sirius
learned
what
was
and
rescued
him
Was
tell
you
then
the
moment
when
you
had
triumphantly
snatched
your
godfather
from
the
jaws
the
Ministry
But
now
the
age
thirteen
excuses
were
running
out
Young
you
might
but
you
had
proved
you
were
exceptional
conscience
was
uneasy
Harry
knew
the
time
must
come
soon
But
you
came
out
the
maze
last
year
having
watched
Cedric
Diggory
die
having
escaped
death
narrowly
yourself
and
did
not
tell
you
though
knew
now
Voldemort
had
returned
must
soon
And
now
tonight
know
you
have
long
been
ready
for
the
knowledge
have
kept
from
you
for
long
because
you
have
proved
that
should
have
placed
the
burden
upon
you
before
this
only
defence
this
have
watched
you
struggling
under
more
burdens
than
any
student
who
has
ever
passed
through
this
school
and
could
not
bring
myself
add
another
the
greatest
one
all
Harry
waited
but
Dumbledore
did
not
speak
still
don
understand
Voldemort
tried
kill
you
when
you
were
child
because
prophecy
made
shortly
before
your
birth
knew
the
prophecy
had
been
made
though
did
not
know
its
full
contents
set
out
kill
you
when
you
were
still
baby
believing
was
fulfilling
the
terms
the
prophecy
discovered
his
cost
that
was
mistaken
when
the
curse
intended
kill
you
backfired
And
since
his
return
his
body
and
particularly
since
your
extraordinary
escape
from
him
last
year
has
been
determined
hear
that
prophecy
its
entirety
This
the
weapon
has
been
seeking
assiduously
since
his
return
the
knowledge
how
destroy
you
The
sun
had
risen
fully
now
Dumbledore
office
was
bathed
The
glass
case
which
the
sword
Godric
Gryffindor
resided
gleamed
white
and
opaque
the
fragments
the
instruments
Harry
had
thrown
the
floor
glistened
like
raindrops
and
behind
him
the
baby
Fawkes
made
soft
chirruping
noises
his
nest
ashes
The
prophecy
smashed
Harry
said
blankly
was
pulling
Neville
those
benches
the
the
room
where
the
archway
was
and
ripped
his
robes
and
fell
The
thing
that
smashed
was
merely
the
record
the
prophecy
kept
the
Department
Mysteries
But
the
prophecy
was
made
somebody
and
that
person
has
the
means
recalling
perfectly
Who
heard
asked
Harry
though
thought
knew
the
answer
already
did
said
Dumbledore
cold
wet
night
sixteen
years
ago
room
above
the
bar
the
Hog
Head
inn
had
gone
there
see
applicant
for
the
post
Divination
teacher
though
was
against
inclination
allow
the
subject
Divination
continue
all
The
applicant
however
was
the
great
great
granddaughter
very
famous
very
gifted
Seer
and
thought
common
politeness
meet
her
was
disappointed
seemed
that
she
had
not
trace
the
gift
herself
told
her
courteously
hope
that
did
not
think
she
would
suitable
for
the
post
turned
leave
Dumbledore
got
his
feet
and
walked
past
Harry
the
black
cabinet
that
stood
beside
Fawkes
perch
bent
down
slid
back
catch
and
took
from
inside
the
shallow
stone
basin
carved
with
runes
around
the
edges
which
Harry
had
seen
his
father
tormenting
Snape
Dumbledore
walked
back
the
desk
placed
the
Pensieve
upon
and
raised
his
wand
his
own
temple
From
withdrew
silvery
gossamer
fine
strands
thought
clinging
the
wand
and
deposited
them
into
the
basin
sat
back
down
behind
his
desk
and
watched
his
thoughts
swirl
and
drift
inside
the
Pensieve
for
moment
Then
with
sigh
raised
his
wand
and
prodded
the
silvery
substance
with
its
tip
figure
rose
out
draped
shawls
her
eyes
magnified
enormous
size
behind
her
glasses
and
she
revolved
slowly
her
feet
the
basin
But
when
Sybill
Trelawney
spoke
was
not
her
usual
ethereal
mystic
voice
but
the
harsh
hoarse
tones
Harry
had
heard
her
use
once
before
The
one
with
the
power
vanquish
the
Dark
Lord
approaches
born
those
who
have
thrice
defied
him
born
the
seventh
month
dies
and
the
Dark
Lord
will
mark
him
his
equal
but
will
have
power
the
Dark
Lord
knows
not
and
either
must
die
the
hand
the
other
for
neither
can
live
while
the
other
survives
the
one
with
the
power
vanquish
the
Dark
Lord
will
born
the
seventh
month
dies
The
slowly
revolving
Professor
Trelawney
sank
back
into
the
silver
mass
below
and
vanished
The
silence
within
the
office
was
absolute
Neither
Dumbledore
nor
Harry
nor
any
the
portraits
made
sound
Even
Fawkes
had
fallen
silent
Professor
Dumbledore
Harry
said
very
quietly
for
Dumbledore
still
staring
the
Pensieve
seemed
completely
lost
thought
did
that
mean
what
did
that
mean
meant
said
Dumbledore
that
the
person
who
has
the
only
chance
conquering
Lord
Voldemort
for
good
was
born
the
end
July
nearly
sixteen
years
ago
This
boy
would
born
parents
who
had
already
defied
Voldemort
three
times
Harry
felt
though
something
was
closing
him
His
breathing
seemed
difficult
again
means
Dumbledore
surveyed
him
for
moment
through
his
glasses
The
odd
thing
Harry
said
softly
that
may
not
have
meant
you
all
Sybill
prophecy
could
have
applied
two
wizard
boys
both
born
the
end
July
that
year
both
whom
had
parents
the
Order
the
Phoenix
both
sets
parents
having
narrowly
escaped
Voldemort
three
times
One
course
was
you
The
other
was
Neville
Longbottom
But
then
but
then
why
was
name
the
prophecy
and
not
Neville
The
official
record
was
labelled
after
Voldemort
attack
you
child
said
Dumbledore
seemed
plain
the
keeper
the
Hall
Prophecy
that
Voldemort
could
only
have
tried
kill
you
because
knew
you
the
one
whom
Sybill
was
referring
Then
might
not
said
Harry
afraid
said
Dumbledore
slowly
looking
though
every
word
cost
him
great
effort
that
there
doubt
that
you
But
you
said
Neville
was
born
the
end
July
too
and
his
mum
and
dad
You
are
forgetting
the
next
part
the
prophecy
the
final
identifying
feature
the
boy
who
could
vanquish
Voldemort
Voldemort
himself
wouldmark
him
hisequal
And
did
Harry
chose
you
not
Neville
gave
you
the
scar
that
has
proved
both
blessing
and
curse
But
might
have
chosen
wrong
said
Harry
might
have
marked
the
wrong
person
chose
the
boy
thought
most
likely
danger
him
said
Dumbledore
And
notice
this
Harry
chose
not
the
pureblood
which
according
his
creed
the
only
kind
wizard
worth
being
knowing
but
the
half
blood
like
himself
saw
himself
you
before
had
ever
seen
you
and
marking
you
with
that
scar
did
not
kill
you
intended
but
gave
you
powers
and
future
which
have
fitted
you
escape
him
not
once
but
four
times
far
something
that
neither
your
parents
nor
Neville
parents
ever
achieved
Why
did
then
said
Harry
who
felt
numb
and
cold
Why
did
try
and
kill
baby
should
have
waited
see
whether
Neville
looked
more
dangerous
when
were
older
and
tried
kill
whoever
was
then
That
might
indeed
have
been
the
more
practical
course
said
Dumbledore
except
that
Voldemort
information
about
the
prophecy
was
incomplete
The
Hog
Head
inn
which
Sybill
chose
for
its
cheapness
has
long
attracted
shall
say
more
interesting
clientele
than
the
Three
Broomsticks
you
and
your
friends
found
out
your
cost
and
mine
that
night
place
where
never
safe
assurpe
you
are
not
being
overheard
course
had
not
dreamed
when
set
out
meet
Sybill
Trelawney
that
would
hear
anything
worth
overhearing
our
one
stroke
ofgood
fortune
was
that
the
eavesdropper
was
detected
only
short
way
into
the
prophecy
and
thrown
from
the
building
only
heard
heard
only
the
beginning
the
part
foretelling
the
birth
boy
July
parents
who
had
thrice
defied
Voldemort
Consequently
could
not
warn
his
master
that
attack
you
would
risk
transferring
power
you
and
marking
you
his
equal
Voldemort
never
knew
that
there
might
danger
attacking
you
that
might
wise
wait
learn
more
did
not
know
that
you
would
havepower
the
Dark
Lord
knows
not
But
don
said
Harry
strangled
voice
haven
any

the
way
did
tonight

them
There
room
the
Department
Mysteries
interrupted
Dumbledore
that
kept
locked
all
times
contains
force
that
once
more
wonderful
and
more
terrible
than
death
than
human
intelligence
than
the
forces
nature
also
perhaps
the
most
mysterious
the
many
subjects
for
study
that
reside
there
the
power
held
within
that
room
that
you
possess
such
quantities
and
which
Voldemort
has
not
all
That
power
took
you
save
Sirius
tonight
That
power
also
saved
you
from
possession
Voldemort
because
could
not
bear
reside
body
full
the
force
detests
the
end
mattered
not
that
you
could
not
close
your
mind
was
your
heart
that
saved
you
Harry
closed
his
eyes
had
not
gone
save
Sirius
Sirius
would
not
have
died
More
stave
off
the
moment
when
would
have
think
Sirius
again
Harry
asked
without
caring
much
about
the
answer
The
end
the
prophecy
was
something
about
neither
can
live
while
the
other
survives
said
Dumbledore
said
Harry
dredging
the
words
from
what
felt
like
deep
well
despair
inside
him
does
that
mean
that
that
one
has
got
kill
the
other
one
the
end
Yes
said
Dumbledore
For
long
time
neither
them
spoke
Somewhere
far
beyond
the
office
walls
Harry
could
hear
the
sound
voices
students
heading
down
the
Great
Hall
for
early
breakfast
perhaps
seemed
impossible
that
there
could
people
the
world
who
still
desired
food
who
laughed
who
neither
knew
nor
cared
that
Sirius
Black
was
gone
for
ever
Sirius
seemed
million
miles
away
already
even
now
part
Harry
still
believed
that
had
only
pulled
back
that
veil
would
have
found
Sirius
looking
back
him
greeting
him
perhaps
with
his
laugh
like
bark
feel
owe
you
another
explanation
Harry
said
Dumbledore
hesitantly
You
may
perhaps
have
wondered
why
never
chose
you
prefect
must
confess
that
rather
thought
you
had
enough
responsibility
going

Harry
looked

and
saw
tear
trickling
down
Dumbledore
face
into
his
long
silver
beard
THE

brief
statement
Friday
night
Minister
for
Magic
Cornelius
Fudge
confirmed
that
Who

has
returned
this
country
and
once

with
great
regret
that
must
confirm
that
the

Lord
well

said
Fudge
looking
tired
and
flustered
addressed
reporters
with
almost
equal
regret
that
report
the
mass
revolt
the
Dementors
Azkaban
who
have
shown
themselves
averse
continuing
the
Ministry
employ
believe
the
Dementors
are

defence
which
will

free
all
wizarding
homes
within
the
coming
month
The
Minister
statement
was
met
with
dismay
and
alarm
from
the
wizarding
community
which
recently
last
Wednesday
was
receiving
Ministry
assurances
that
there
was
truth
whatsoever
these
persistent
rumours
that

the

Thursday

said
Hermione
looking
over

the

him
They
were
the

Harry
was
sitting

and
they
were
both
listening
Hermione

Luna
who
had
dropped

clutching
the

reading
the

upside
down
and
apparently
not
taking
word
Hermione
was
saying
the
Boy

now
though
isn
said
Ron
darkly
Not
such
deluded

helped
himself

from
the
immense
pile
his
bedside
cabinet
threw
few
Harry
Ginny
and
Neville
and
ripped
off
the
wrapper
his
own
with
his
teeth
There
were
still
deep
welts
his
forearms
where
the
brain
tentacles
had
wrapped
around
him
According
Madam
Pomfrey
thoughts
could
leave
deeper
scarring
than
almost
anything
else
though
since
she
had
started
applying
copious
amounts
Ubbly
Oblivious
Unction
there
seemed
have
been
some
improvement
Yes
they
very
complimentary
about
you
now
Harry
said
Hermione
scanning
down
the
article

voice

perceived
unbalanced
yet
never
wavered
his
story
forced

ridicule
and
slander
Hmmm
she
said
frowning
notice
they
don
mention
the
fact
that
was
them
doing
all
the
ridiculing
and
slandering
theProphet
She
winced
slightly
and
put

her

The

Dolohov

used
her

less
effective
than

been

That

Ginny

and
looked
away
quickly
grinning
anyway

and

Ginny

But

Hermione

Filch

against

Not
all
said
Ginny
really
really
miserable
actually
She
lowered
her
voice
whisper
keeps
saying
Umbridge
was
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
Hogwarts
All
six
them
looked
around
Professor
Umbridge
was
lying
bed
opposite
them
gazing
the
ceiling
Dumbledore
had
strode
alone
into
the
Forest
rescue
her
from
the
centaurs
how
had
done
how
had
emerged
from
the
trees
supporting
Professor
Umbridge
without
much
scratch
him
nobody
knew
and
Umbridge
was
certainly
not
telling
Since
she
had
returned
the
castle
she
had
not
far
any
them
knew
uttered
single
word
Nobody
really
knew
what
was
wrong
with
her
either
Her
usually
neat
mousy
hair
was
very
untidy
and
there
were
still
bits
twigs
and
leaves
but
otherwise
she
seemed
quite
unscathed
Madam
Pomfrey
says
she
just
shock
whispered
Hermione
Sulking
more
like
said
Ginny
Yeah
she
shows
signs
life
you
this
said
Ron
and
with
his
tongue
made
soft
clip
clopping
noises
Umbridge
sat
bolt
upright
looking
around
wildly
Anything
wrong
Professor
called
Madam
Pomfrey
poking
her
head
around
her
office
door
said
Umbridge
sinking
back
into
her
pillows
must
have
been
dreaming
Hermione
and
Ginny
muffled
their
laughter
the
bedclothes
Speaking

Hermione
when
she

Harry
the

Ginny
Bet
Dumbledore

said
Ron
now
munching
his
fourteenth
Frog
Mind
you

useless
you
ask
Firenze

better
How
can
you

Hermione
demanded
After
just

thereare
real
prophecies
Harry
heart
began
race
had
not
told
Ron
Hermione
anyone

what
the

Neville
had
told

smashed
while
Harry
was
pulling
him
the
steps
the
Death
Room
and
Harry
had
not
yet
corrected
this
impression
was
not
ready
see
their
expressions
when
told
them
that
must
either
murderer
victim
there
was
other
way
pity
broke
said
Hermione
quietly
shaking
her
head
Yeah
said
Ron
Still
least
You
Know
Who
never
found
out
what
was
either
where
are
you
going
added
looking
both
surprised
and
disappointed
Harry
stood
Hagrid
said
Harry
You
know
just
got
back
and
promised
down
and
see
him
and
tell
him
how
you
two
are
all
right
then
said
Ron
grumpily
looking
out
the
dormitory
window
the
patch
bright
blue
sky
beyond
Wish
could
come
Say
hello
him
fir
called
Hermione
Harry
proceeded
down
the
ward
And
ask
him
what
happening
about
about
his
little
friend
Harry
gave
wave
his
hand
show
had
heard
and
understood
left
the
dormitory
The
castle
seemed
very
quiet
even
for
Sunday
Everybody
was
clearly
out
the
sunny
grounds
enjoying
the
end
their
exams
and
the
prospect
last
few
days
term
unhampered
revision
homework
Harry
walked
slowly
along
the
deserted
corridor
peering
out
windows
went
could
see
people
messing
around
the
air
over
the
Quidditch
pitch
and
couple
students
swimming
the
lake
accompanied
the
giant
squid
was
finding
hard
decide
whether
wanted
with
people
not
whenever
was
company
wanted
get
away
and
whenever
was
alone
wanted
company
thought
might
really
and
visit
Hagrid
though
had
not
talked
him
properly
since
returned
Harry
had
just
descended
the
last
marble
step
into
the
Entrance
Hall
when
Malloy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
emerged
from
door
the
right
that
Harry
knew
led
down
the
Slytherin
common
room
Harry
stopped
dead
did
Malfoy
and
the
others
The
only
sounds
were
the
shouts
laughter
and
splashes
drifting
into
the
Hall
from
the
grounds
through
the
open
front
doors
Malfoy
glanced
around
Harry
knew
was
checking
for
signs
teachers
then
looked
back
Harry
and
said
low
voice
You
dead
Potter
Harry
raised
his
eyebrows
Funny
said
you
think
have
stopped
walking
around
Malloy
looked
angrier
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
him
felt
kind
detached
satisfaction
the
sight
his
pale
pointed
face
contorted
with
rage
You
going
pay
said
Malloy
voice
barely
louder
than
whisper
going
make
you
pay
for
what
you
done
father
Well
terrified
now
said
Harry
sarcastically
pose
Lord
Voldemort
just
warm
act
compared
you
three
what
the
matter
added
for
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
had
all
looked
stricken
the
sound
the
name
mate
your
dad
isn
Not
scared
him
are
you
You
think
you
such
big
man
Potter
said
Malfoy
advancing
now
Crabbe
and
Goyle
flanking
him
You
wait
have
you
You
can
land
father
prison
thought
just
had
said
Harry
The
Dementors
have
left
Azkaban
said
Malfoy
quietly
Dad
and
the
others
out
time
Yeah
expect
they
will
said
Harry
Still
least
everyone
knows
what
scumbags
they
are
now
Malfoy
hand
flew
towards
his
wand
but
Harry
was
too
quick
for
him
had
drawn
his
own
wand
before
Malfoy
fingers
had
even
entered
the
pocket
his
robes
Potter
The
voice
rang
across
the
Entrance
Hall
Snape
had
emerged
from
the
staircase
leading
down
his
office
and
the
sight
him
Harry
felt
great
rush
hatred
beyond
anything
felt
towards
Malloy
whatever
Dumbledore
said
would
never
forgive
Snape
never
What
are
you
doing
Potter
said
Snape
coldly
ever
strode
over
the
four
them
trying
decide
what
curse
use
Malloy
sir
said
Harry
fiercely
Snape
stared
him
Put
that
wand
away
once
said
curtly
Ten
points
from
Gryff
Snape
looked
towards
the
giant
hour
glasses
the
walls
and
gave
sneering
smile
see
there
are
longer
any
points
left
the
Gryffindor
hour
glass
take
away
that
case
Potter
will
simply
have
Add
some
more
Professor
McGonagall
had
just
stumped
the
stone
steps
into
the
castle
she
was
carrying
tartan
carpetbag
one
hand
and
leaning
heavily
walking
stick
with
her
other
but
otherwise
looked
quite
well
Professor
McGonagall
said
Snape
striding
forwards
Out
Mungo
see
Yes
Professor
Snape
said
Professor
McGonagall
shrugging
off
her
travelling
cloak
quite
good
new
You
two
Crabbe
Goyle
She
beckoned
them
forwards
imperiously
and
they
came
shuffling
their
large
feet
and
looking
awkward
Here
said
Professor
McGonagall
thrusting
her
carpetbag
into
Crabbe
chest
and
her
cloak
into
Goyle
take
these
office
for
They
turned
and
stumped
away
the
marble
staircase
Right
then
said
Professor
McGonagall
looking
the
hourglasses
the
wall
Well
think
Potter
and
his
friends
ought
have
fifty
points
apiece
for
alerting
the
world
the
return
You
Know
Who
What
say
you
Professor
Snape
What
snapped
Snape
though
Harry
knew
had
heard
perfectly
well
well
suppose
that
fifty
each
for
Potter
the
two
Weasleys
Longbottom
and
Miss
Granger
said
Professor
McGanagall
and
shower
rubies
fell
down
into
the
bottom
bulb
Gryffindor
hour
glass
she
spoke
and
fifty
for
Miss
Lovegood
suppose
she
added
and
number
sapphiresfell
into
Ravenclaw
glass
Now
you
wanted
take
ten
from
Potter
think
Professor
Snape
there
are
few
rubies
retreated
into
the
upper
bulb
leaving
respectable
amount
below
nevertheless
Well
Potter
Malfoy
think
you
ought
outside
glorious
day
like
this
Professor
McGonagall
continued
briskly
Harry
did
not
need
telling
twice
thrust
his
wand
back
inside
his
robes
and
headed
straight
for
the
front
doors
without
another
glance
Snape
and
Malfoy
The
hot
sun
hit
him
with
blast
walked
across
the
lawns
towards
Hagrid
cabin
Students
lying
around
the
grass
sunbathing
talking
reading
theSunday
Prophet
and
eating
sweets
looked
him
passed
some
called
out
him
else
waved
clearly
eager
show
that
they
like
theProphet
had
decided
was
something
hero
Harry
said
nothing
any
them
had
idea
how
much
they
knew
what
had
happened
three
days
ago
but
had
far
avoided
being
questioned
and
preferred
keep
that
way
thought
first
when
knocked
Hagrid
cabin
door
that
was
out
but
then
Fang
came
charging
around
the
corner
and
almost
bowled
him
over
with
the
enthusiasm
his
welcome
Hagrid
transpired
was
picking
runner
beans
his
back
garden
All
righ
Harry
said
beaming
when
Harry
approached
the
fence
Come
come
have
cup
dandelion
juice
How
things
Hagrid
asked
him
they
settled
down
his
wooden
table
with
glass
apiece
iced
juice
Yeh
feelin
all
righ
are
yeh
Harry
knew
from
the
look
concern
Hagrid
face
that
was
not
referring
Harry
physical
well
being
fine
Harry
said
quickly
because
could
not
bear
discuss
the
thing
that
knew
was
Hagrid
mind
where
you
been
Bin
hidin
out
the
mountains
said
Hagrid
cave
like
Sirius
did
when
Hagrid
broke
off
cleared
his
throat
gruffly
looked
Harry
and
took
long
draught
juice
Anyway
back
now
said
feebly
You
you
look
better
said
Harry
who
was
determined
keep
the
conversation
moving
away
from
Sirius
Wha
said
Hagrid
raising
massive
hand
and
feeling
his
face
yeah
Well
Grawpy
loads
better
behaved
now
loads
Seemed
right
pleased
ter
see
when
got
back
ter
tell
yeh
the
truth
good
lad
really
bin
thinkin
abou
tryin
ter
find
him
ladyfriend
actually
Harry
would
normally
have
tried
persuade
Hagrid
out
this
idea
once
the
prospect
second
giant
taking
residence
the
Forest
possibly
even
wilder
and
more
brutal
than
Grawp
was
positively
alarming
but
somehow
Harry
could
not
muster
the
energy
necessary
argue
the
point
was
starting
wish
was
alone
again
and
with
the
idea
hastening
his
departure
took
several
large
gulps
his
dandelion
juice
half
emptying
his
glass
ryone
knows
yeh
bin
tellin
the
truth
now
Harry
said
Hagrid
softly
and
unexpectedly
was
watching
Harry
closely
Tha
gotta
better
hasn
Harry
shrugged
Look
Hagrid
leaned
towards
him
across
the
table
knew
Sirius
longer
yeh
did
died
battle
tha
the
way
wanted
ter
didn
want
all
said
Harry
angrily
Hagrid
bowed
his
great
shaggy
head
Nah
don
reckon
did
said
quietly
But
still
Harry
was
never
one
ter
sit
aroun
home
let
other
people
the
fightin
couldn
lived
with
himself
hadn
gone
ter
help
Harry
leapt
got
and
visit
Ron
and
Hermione
the
hospital
wing
said
mechanically
said
Hagrid
looking
rather
upset
all
righ
then
Harry
take
care
yerself
then
drop
back
yeh
got
Yeah
right
Harry
crossed
the
door
fast
could
and
pulled
open
was
out
the
sunshine
again
before
Hagrid
had
finished
saying
goodbye
and
walking
away
across
the
lawn
Once
again
people
called
out
him
passed
closed
his
eyes
for
few
moments
wishing
they
would
all
vanish
that
could
open
his
eyes
and
find
himself
alone
the
grounds
few
days
ago
before
his
exams
had
finished
and
had
seen
the
vision
Voldemort
had
planted
his
mind
would
have
given
almost
anything
for
the
wizarding
world
know
had
been
telling
the
truth
for
them
believe
that
Voldemort
was
back
and
know
that
was
neither
liar
nor
mad
Now
however
walked
short
way
around
the
lake
sat
down
its
bank
sheltered
from
the
gaze
passers
behind
tangle
shrubs
and
stared
out
over
the
gleaming
water
thinking
Perhaps
the
reason
wanted
alone
was
because
had
felt
isolated
from
everybody
since
his
talk
with
Dumbledore
invisible
barrier
separated
him
from
the
rest
the
world
was
had
always
been
marked
man
was
just
that
had
never
really
understood
what
that
meant
And
yet
sitting
here
the
edge
the
lake
with
the
terriblc
weight
grief
dragging
him
with
the
loss
Sirius
raw
and
fresh
inside
could
not
muster
any
great
sense
fear
was
sunny
and
the
grounds
around
him
were
full
laughing
people
and
even
though
felt
distant
from
them
though
belonged
different
race
was
still
very
hard
believe
sat
here
that
his
life
must
include
end
murder
sat
there
for
long
time
gazing
out
the
water
trying
not
think
about
his
godfather
remember
that
was
directly
across
from
here
the
opposite
bank
that
Sirius
had
once
collapsed
trying
fend
off
hundred
Dementors
The
sun
had
set
before
realised
was
cold
got
and
returned
the
castle
wiping
his
face
his
sleeve
went
Ron
and
Hermione
left
the
hospital
wing
completely
cured
three
days
before
the
end
term
Hermione
kept
showing
signs
wanting
talk
about
Sirius
but
Ron
tended
make
hushing
noises
every
time
she
mentioned
his
name
Harry
was
still
not
sure
whether
not
wanted
talk
about
his
godfather
yet
his
wishes
varied
with
his
mood
knew
one
thing
though
unhappy
felt
the
moment
would
greatly
miss
Hogwarts
few
days
time
when
was
back
number
four
Privet
Drive
Even
though
now
understood
exactly
why
had
return
there
every
summer
did
not
feel
any
better
about
Indeed
had
never
dreaded
his
return
more
Professor
Umbridge
left
Hogwarts
the
day
before
the
end
term
seemed
she
had
crept
out
the
hospital
wing
during
dinnertime
evidently
hoping
depart
undetected
but
unfortunately
for
her
she
met
Peeves
the
way
who
seized
his
last
chance
Fred
had
instructed
and
chased
her
gleefully
from
the
premises
whacking
her
alternately
with
walking
stick
and
sock
full
chalk
Many
students
ran
out
into
the
Entrance
Hall
watch
her
running
away
down
the
path
and
the
Heads
Houses
tried
only
half
heartedly
restrain
them
Indeed
Professor
McGonagall
sank
back
into
her
chair
the
staff
table
after
few
feeble
remonstrances
and
was
clearly
heard
express
regret
that
she
could
not
run
cheering
after
Umbridge
herself
because
Peeves
had
borrowed
her
walking
stick
Their
last
evening
school
arrived
most
people
had
finished
packing
and
were
already
heading
down
the
end
term
leaving
feast
but
Harry
had
not
even
started
Just
tomorrow
said
Ron
who
was
waiting
the
door
their
dormitory
Come
starving
won
long
look
you
ahead
But
when
the
dormitory
door
closed
behind
Ron
Harry
made
effort
speed
his
packing
The
very
last
thing
wanted
was
attend
the
Leaving
Feast
was
worried
that
Dumbledore
would
make
some
reference
him
his
speech
was
sure
mention
Voldemort
return
had
talked
them
about
last
year
after
all
Harry
pulled
some
crumpled
robes
out
the
very
bottom
his
trunk
make
way
for
folded
ones
and
did
noticed
badly
wrapped
package
lying
corner
could
not
think
what
was
doing
there
bent
down
pulled
out
from
underneath
his
trainers
and
examined
realised
what
was
within
seconds
Sirius
had
given
him
just
inside
the
front
door
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
Use
you
need
all
right
Harry
sank
down
his
bed
and
unwrapped
the
package
Out
fell
small
square
mirror
looked
old
was
certainly
dirty
Harry
held
his
face
and
saw
his
own
reflection
looking
back
him
turned
the
mirror
over
There
the
reverse
side
was
scribbled
note
from
Sirius
This
two
way
mirror
got
the
other
one
the
pair
you
need
speak
just
say
name
into
you
appear
mirror
and
able
talk
yours
James
and
used
use
them
when
were
separate
detentions
Harry
heart
began
race
remembered
seeing
his
dead
parents
the
Mirror
Erised
four
years
ago
was
going
able
talk
Sirius
again
right
now
knew
looked
around
make
sure
there
was
nobody
else
there
the
dormitory
was
quite
empty
looked
back
the
mirror
raised
front
his
face
with
trembling
hands
and
said
loudly
and
clearly
Sirius
His
breath
misted
the
surface
the
glass
held
the
mirror
even
closer
excitement
flooding
through
him
but
the
eyes
blinking
back
him
through
the
fog
were
definitely
his
own
wiped
the
mirror
clear
again
and
said
that
every
syllable
rang
clearly
through
the
room
Sirius
Black
Nothing
happened
The
frustrated
face
looking
back
out
the
mirror
was
still
definitely
his
own
Sirius
didn
have
his
mirror
him
when
went
through
the
archway
said
small
voice
Harry
head
That
why
not
working
Harry
remained
quite
still
for
moment
then
hurled
the
mirror
back
into
the
trunk
where
shattered
had
been
convinced
for
whole
shining
minute
that
was
going
see
Sirius
talk
him
again
Disappointment
was
burning
his
throat
got
and
began
throwing
his
things
pell
mell
into
the
trunk
top
the
broken
mirror
But
then
idea
struck
him
better
idea
than
mirror
much
bigger
more
important
idea
how
had
never
thought
before
why
had
never
asked
was
sprinting
out
the
dormitory
and
down
the
spiral
staircase
hitting
the
walls
ran
and
barely
noticing
hurtled
across
the
empty
common
room
through
the
portrait
hole
and
off
along
the
corridor
ignoring
the
Fat
Lady
who
called
after
him
The
feast
about
start
you
know
you
cutting
very
fine
But
Harry
had
intention
going
the
feast
How
could
that
the
place
was
full
ghosts
whenever
you
didn
need
one
yet
now
ran
down
staircases
and
along
corridors
and
met
nobody
either
alive
dead
They
were
all
clearly
the
Great
Hall
Outside
his
Charms
classroom
came
halt
panting
and
thinking
disconsolately
that
would
have
wait
until
later
until
after
the
end
the
feast
But
just
had
given
hope
saw
translucent
somebody
drifting
across
the
end
the
corridor
Hey
hey
Nick
NICK
The
ghost
stuck
its
head
back
out
the
wall
revealing
the
extravagantly
plumed
hat
and
dangerously
wobbling
head
Sir
Nicholas
Mimsy
Porpington
Good
evening
said
withdrawing
the
rest
his
body
from
the
solid
stone
and
smiling
Harry
not
the
only
one
who
late
then
Though
sighed
rather
different
sense
course
Nick
can
ask
you
something
most
peculiar
expression
stole
over
Nearly
Headless
Nick
face
inserted
finger
the
stiff
ruff
his
neck
and
tugged
little
straighter
apparently
give
himself
thinking
time
desisted
only
when
his
partially
severed
neck
seemed
about
give
way
completely
now
Harry
said
Nick
looking
discomfited
Can
wait
until
after
the
feast
Nick
please
said
Harry
really
need
talk
you
Can
here
Harry
opened
the
door
the
nearest
classroom
and
Nearly
Headless
Nick
sighed
very
well
said
looking
resigned
can
pretend
haven
been
expecting
Harry
was
holding
the
door
open
for
him
but
drifted
through
the
wall
instead
Expecting
what
Harry
asked
closed
the
door
You
come
and
find
said
Nick
now
gliding
over
the
window
and
looking
out
the
darkening
grounds
happens
sometimes
when
somebody
has
suffered
loss
Well
said
Harry
refusing
deflected
You
were
right
come
find
you
Nick
said
nothing
said
Harry
who
was
finding
this
more
awkward
than
had
anticipated
just
you
dead
But
you
still
here
aren
you
Nick
sighed
and
continued
gaze
out
the
grounds
That
right
isn
Harry
urged
him
You
died
but
talking
you
you
can
walk
around
Hogwarts
and
everything
can
you
Yes
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
quietly
walk
and
talk
yes
you
came
back
didn
you
said
Harry
urgently
People
can
come
back
right
ghosts
They
don
have
disappear
completely
Well
added
impatiently
when
Nick
continued
say
nothing
Nearly
Headless
Nick
hesitated
then
said
Not
everyone
can
come
back
ghost
What
you
mean
said
Harry
quickly
Only
only
wizards
said
Harry
and
almost
laughed
with
relief
Well
that
then
the
person
asking
about
wizard
can
come
back
right
Nick
turned
away
from
the
window
and
looked
mournfully
Harry
won
come
back
Who
Sirius
Black
said
Nick
But
you
did
said
Harry
angrily
You
came
back
you
dead
and
you
didn
disappear
Wizards
can
leave
imprint
themselves
upon
the
earth
walk
palely
where
their
living
selves
once
trod
said
Nick
miserably
But
very
few
wizards
choose
that
path
Why
not
said
Harry
Anyway
doesn
matter
Sirius
won
care
unusual
come
back
know
will
And
strong
was
his
belief
Harry
actually
turned
his
head
check
the
door
sure
for
split
second
that
was
going
see
Sirius
pearly
white
and
transparent
but
beaming
walking
through
towards
him
will
not
come
back
repeated
Nick
will
have
gone
What
you
mean
gone
said
Harry
quickly
Gone

Listen

happens
when
you
die
anyway
Where

Why
doesn
everyone

Why
isn
this
place
full
ghosts
Why

said
Nick
You

said
Harry
exasperatedly
Who

answer
better
than

was
afraid

said
Nick
softly
chose
remain
behind
sometimes
wonder
whether
oughtn
have
well
that
neither
here
nor
there
fact
neither
here
nor
there
gave
small
sad
chuckle
know
nothing
the
secrets
death
Harry
for
chose
feeble
imitation
life
instead
believe
learned
wizards
study
the
matter
the
Department
Mysteries
Don
talk
about
that
place
said
Harry
fiercely
sorry
not
have
been
more
help
said
Nick
gently
Well
well
excuse
the
feast
you
know
And
left
the
room
leaving
Harry
there
alone
gazing
blankly
the
wall
through
which
Nick
had
disappeared
Harry
felt
almost
though
had
lost
his
godfather
all
over
again
losing
the
hope
that
might
able
see
speak
him
once
more
walked
slowly
and
miserably
back
through
the
empty
castle
wondering
whether
would
ever
feel
cheerful
again
had
turned
the
corner
towards
the
Fat
Lady
corridor
when
saw
somebody
ahead
fastening
note
board
the
wall
second
glance
showed
him
was
Luna
There
were
good
hiding
places
nearby
she
was
bound
have
heard
his
footsteps
and
any
case
Harry
could
hardly
muster
the
energy
avoid
anyone
the
moment
Hello
said
Luna
vaguely
glancing
around
him
she
stepped
back
from
the
notice
How
come
you
not
the
feast
Harry
asked
Well
lost
most
possessions
said
Luna
serenely
People
take
them
and
hide
them
you
know
But
the
last
night
really
need
them
back
been
putting
signs
She
gestured
towards
the
noticeboard
upon
which
sure
enough
she
had
pinned
list
all
her
missing
books
and
clothes
with
plea
for
their
return
odd
feeling
rose
Harry
emotion
quite
different
from
the
anger
and
grief
that
had
filled
him
since
Sirius
death
was
few
moments
before
realised
that
was
feeling
sorry
for
Luna
How
come
people
hide
your
stuff
asked
her
frowning
well
she
shrugged
think
they
think
bit
odd
you
know
Some
people
call
Loony
Lovegood
actually
Harry
looked
her
and
the
new
feeling
pity
intensified
rather
painfully
That
reason
for
them
take
your
things
said
flatly
you
want
help
finding
them
she
said
smiling
him
They
come
back
they
always
the
end
was
just
that
wanted
pack
tonight
Anyway
why
aren
tyou
the
feast
Harry
shrugged
Just
didn
feel
like
said
Luna
observing
him
with
those
oddly
misty
protuberant
eyes
don
suppose
you
That
man
the
Death
Eaters
killed
was
your
godfather
wasn
Ginny
told
Harry
nodded
curtly
but
found
that
for
some
reason
did
not
mind
Luna
talking
about
Sirius
had
just
remembered
that
she
too
could
see
Thestrals
Have
you
began
mean
who
has
anyone
you
known
ever
died
Yes
said
Luna
simply
mother
She
was
quite
extraordinary
witch
you
know
but
she
did
like
experiment
and
one
her
spells
went
rather
badly
wrong
one
day
was
nine
sorry
Harry
mumbled
Yes
was
rather
horrible
said
Luna
conversationally
still
feel
very
sad
about
sometimes
But
still
got
Dad
And
anyway
not
though
never
see
Mum
again
isn
said
Harry
uncertainly
She
shook
her
head
disbelief
come
You
heard
them
just
behind
the
veil
didn
you
You
mean
that
room
with
the
archway
They
were
just
lurking
out
sight
that
all
You
heard
them
They
looked
each
other
Luna
was
smiling
slightly
Harry
did
not
know
what
say
think
Luna
believed
many
extraordinary
things
yet
had
been
sure
had
heard
voices
behind
the
veil
too
Are
you
sure
you
don
want
help
you
look
for
your
stuff
said
said
Luna
think
just
down
and
have
some
pudding
and
wait
for
all
turn
always
does
the
end
well
have
nice
holiday
Harry
Yeah
yeah
you
too
She
walked
away
from
him
and
watched
her
found
that
the
terrible
weight
his
stomach
seemed
have
lessened
slightly
The
journey
home
the
Hogwarts
Express
next
day
was
eventful
several
ways
Firstly
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
had
clearly
been
waiting
all
week
for
the
opportunity
strike
without
teacher
witnesses
attempted
ambush
Harry
halfway
down
the
train
made
his
way
back
from
the
toilet
The
attack
might
have
succeeded
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
they
unwittingly
chose
stage
the
attack
right
outside
compartment
full
members
who
saw
what
was
happening
through
the
glass
and
rose
one
rush
Harry
aid
the
time
Ernie
Macmillan
Hannah
Abbott
Susan
Bones
Justin
Finch
Fletchley
Anthony
Goldstein
and
Terry
Boot
had
finished
using
wide
variety
the
hexes
and
jinxes
Harry
had
taught
them
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
resembled
nothing
much
three
gigantic
slugs
squeezed
into
Hogwarts
uniform
Harry
Ernie
and
Justin
hoisted
them
into
the
luggage
rack
and
left
them
there
ooze
must
say
looking
forward
seeing
Malfoy
mother
face
when
gets
off
the
train
said
Ernie
with
some
satisfaction
watched
Malloy
squirm
above
him
Ernie
had
never
quite
got
over
the
indignity
Malloy
docking
points
from
Hufflepuff
during
his
brief
spell
member
the
Inquisitorial
Squad
Goyle
mum
really
pleased
though
said
Ron
who
had
come
investigate
the
source
the
commotion
loads
betterlooking
now
anyway
Harry
the
food
trolley
just
stopped
you
want
anything
Harry
thanked
the
others
and
accompanied
Ron
back
their
compartment
where
bought
large
pile
cauldron
cakes
and
pumpkin
pasties
Hermione
was
reading
theDaily
Prophet
again
Ginny
was
doing
quiz
inThe
Quibbler
and
Neville
was
stroking
his
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
which
had
grown
great
deal
over
the
year
and
now
made
odd
crooning
noises
when
touched
Harry
and
Ron
whiled
away
most
the
journey
playing
wizard
chess
while
Hermione
read
out
snippets
from
theProphet
was
now
full
articles
about
how
repel
Dementors
attempts
the
Ministry
track
down
Death
Eaters
and
hysterical
letters
claiming
that
the
writer
had
seen
Lord
Voldemort
walking
past
their
house
that
very
morning
hasn
really
started
yet
sighed
Hermione
gloomily
folding
the
newspaper
again
But
won
long
now
Hey
Harry
said
Ron
softly
nodding
towards
the
glass
window
the
corridor
Harry
looked
around
Cho
was
passing
accompanied
Marietta
Edgecombe
who
was
wearing
balaclava
His
and
Cho
eyes
met
for
moment
Cho
blushed
and
kept
walking
Harry
looked
back
down
the
chessboard
just
time
see
one
his
pawns
chased
off
its
square
Ron
knight
What
going
with
you
and
her
anyway
Ron
asked
quietly
Nothing
said
Harry
truthfully
heard
she
going
out
with
someone
else
now
said
Hermione
tentatively
Harry
was
surprised
find
that
this
information
did
not
hurt
all
Wanting
impress
Cho
seemed
belong
past
that
was
longer
quite
connected
with
him
much
what
had
wanted
before
Sirius
death
felt
that
way
these
days
the
week
that
had
elapsed
since
had
last
seen
Sirius
seemed
have
lasted
much
much
longer
stretched
across
two
universes
the
one
with
Sirius
and
the
one
without
You
well
out
mate
said
Ron
forcefully
mean
she
quite
good
looking
and
all
that
but
you
want
someone
bit
more
cheerful
She
probably
cheerful
enough
with
someone
else
said
Harry
shrugging
Who
she
with
now
anyway
Ron
asked
Hermione
but
was
Ginny
who
answered
Michael
Corner
she
said
Michael
but
maid
Ron
craning
around
his
seat
stare
her
But
you
were
going
out
with
him
Not
any
more
said
Ginny
resolutely
didn
like
Gryffindor
beating
Ravenclaw
Quidditch
and
got
really
sulky
ditched
him
and
ran
off
comfort
Cho
instead
She
scratched
her
nose
absently
with
the
end
her
quill
turnedThe
Quibbler
upsidedown
and
began
marking
her
answers
Ron
looked
highly
delighted
Well
always
thought
was
bit
idiot
said
prodding
his
queen
forwards
towards
Harry
quivering
castle
Good
for
you
Just
choose
someone
better
next
time
cast
Harry
oddly
furtive
look
said
Well
chosen
Dean
Thomas
would
you
say
better
asked
Ginny
vaguely
WHAT
shouted
Ron
upending
the
chessboard
Crookshanks
went
plunging
after
the
pieces
and
Hedwig
and
Pigwidgeon
twittered
and
hooted
angrily
from
overhead
the
train
slowed
down
the
approach
King
Cross
Harry
thought
had
never
wanted
leave
less
even
wondered
fleetingly
what
would
happen
simply
refused
get
off
but
remained
stubbornly
sitting
there
until
the
first
September
when
would
take
him
back
Hogwarts
When
finally
puffed
standstill
however
lifted
down
Hedwig
cage
and
prepared
drag
his
trunk
from
the
train
usual
When
the
ticket
inspector
signalled
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
that
was
safe
walk
through
the
magical
barrier
between
platforms
nine
and
ten
however
found
surprise
awaiting
him
the
other
side
group
people
standing
there
greet
him
who
had
not
expected
all
There
was
Mad
Eye
Moody
looking
quite
sinister
with
his
bowler
hat
pulled
low
over
his
magical
eye
would
have
done
without
his
gnarled
hands
clutching
long
staff
his
body
wrapped
voluminous
travelling
cloak
Tonks
stood
just
behind
him
her
bright
bubble
gum
pink
hair
gleaming
the
sunlight
filtering
through
the
dirty
glass
the
station
ceiling
wearing
heavily
patched
jeans
and
bright
purple
shirt
bearing
the
legendThe
Weird
Sisters
Next
Tonks
was
Lupin
his
face
pale
his
hair
greying
long
and
threadbare
overcoat
covering
shabby
jumper
and
trousers
the
front
the
group
stood
and
Mrs
Weasley
dressed
their
Muggle
best
and
Fred
and
George
who
were
both
wearing
brand
new
jackets
some
lurid
green
scaly
material
Ron
Ginny
called
Mrs
Weasley
hurrying
forwards
and
hugging
her
children
tightly
and
Harry
dear
how
are
you
Fine
lied
Harry
she
pulled
him
into
tight
embrace
Over
her
shoulder
saw
Ron
goggling
the
twins
new
clothes
What
arethey
supposed
asked
pointing
the
jackets
Finest
dragonskin
little
bro
said
Fred
giving
his
zip
little
tweak
Business
booming
and
thought
treat
ourselves
Hello
Harry
said
Lupin
Mrs
Weasley
let
Harry
and
turned
greet
Hermione
said
Harry
didn
expect
what
are
you
all
doing
here
Well
said
Lupin
with
slight
smile
thought
might
have
little
chat
with
your
aunt
and
uncle
before
letting
them
take
you
home
dunno
that
good
idea
said
Harry
once
think
growled
Moody
who
had
limped
little
closer
That
them
will
Potter
pointed
with
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
his
magical
eye
was
evidently
peering
through
the
back
his
head
and
his
bowler
hat
Harry
leaned
inch
the
left
see
where
Mad
Eye
was
pointing
and
there
sure
enough
were
the
three
Dursleys
who
looked
positively
appalled
see
Harry
reception
committee
Harry
said
Weasley
turning
from
Hermione
parents
who
had
just
greeted
enthusiastically
and
who
were
now
taking
turns
hug
Hermione
Well
shall
then
Yeah
reckon
Arthur
said
Moody
and
Weasley
took
the
lead
across
the
station
towards
the
Dursleys
who
were
apparently
rooted
the
floor
Hermione
disengaged
herself
gently
from
her
mother
join
the
group
Good
afternoon
said
Weasley
pleasantly
Uncle
Vernon
came
halt
right
front
him
You
might
remember
name
Arthur
Weasley
Weasley
had
single
handedly
demolished
most
the
Dursleys
living
room
two
years
previously
Harry
would
have
been
very
surprised
Uncle
Vernon
had
forgotten
him
Sure
enough
Uncle
Vernon
turned
deeper
shade
puce
and
glared
Weasley
but
chose
not
say
anything
partly
perhaps
because
the
Dursleys
were
outnumbered
two
one
Aunt
Petunia
looked
both
frightened
and
embarrassed
she
kept
glancing
around
though
terrified
somebody
she
knew
would
see
her
such
company
Dudley
meanwhile
seemed
trying
look
small
and
insignificant
feat
which
was
failing
extravagantly
thought
just
have
few
words
with
you
about
Harry
said
Weasley
still
smiling
Yeah
growled
Moody
About
how
treated
when
your
place
Uncle
Vernon
moustache
seemed
bristle
with
indignation
Possibly
because
the
bowler
hat
gave
him
the
entirely
mistaken
impression
that
was
dealing
with
kindred
spirit
addressed
himself
Moody
not
aware
that
any
your
business
what
goes
house
expect
what
you
not
aware
would
fill
several
books
Dursley
growled
Moody
Anyway
that
not
the
point
interjected
Tonks
whose
pink
hair
seemed
offend
Aunt
Petunia
more
than
all
the
rest
put
together
for
she
closed
her
eyes
rather
than
look
her
The
point
find
out
you
been
horrible
Harry
And
make
mistake
hear
about
added
Lupin
pleasantly
Yes
said
Weasley
even
you
won
let
Harry
use
the
fellytone
Telephone
whispered
Hermione
Yeah
get
any
hint
that
Potter
been
mistreated
any
way
you
have
answer
said
Moody
Uncle
Vernon
swelled
ominously
His
sense
outrage
seemed
outweigh
even
his
fear
this
bunch
oddballs
Are
you
threatening
sir
said
loudly
that
passers
actually
turned
stare
Yes
said
Mad
Eye
who
seemed
rather
pleased
that
Uncle
Vernon
had
grasped
this
fact
quickly
And
look
like
the
kind
man
who
can
intimidated
barked
Uncle
Vernon
Well
said
Moody
pushing
back
his
bowler
hat
reveal
his
sinisterly
revolving
magical
eye
Uncle
Vernon
leapt
backwards
horror
and
collided
painfully
with
luggage
trolley
Yes
have
say
you
Dursley
turned
away
from
Uncle
Vernon
survey
Harry
Potter
give
shout
you
need
don
hear
from
you
for
three
days
row
send
someone
along
Aunt
Petunia
whimpered
piteously
could
not
have
been
plainer
that
she
was
thinking
what
the
neighbours
would
say
the
caught
sight
these
people
marching
the
garden
path
Bye
then
Potter
said
Moody
grasping
Harry
shoulder
for
moment
with
gnarled
hand
Take
care
Harry
said
Lupin
quietly
Keep
touch
Harry
have
you
away
from
there
soon
can
Mrs
Weasley
whispered
hugging
him
again
see
you
soon
mate
said
Ron
anxiously
shaking
Harry
hand
Really
soon
Harry
said
Hermione
earnestly
promise
Harry
nodded
somehow
could
not
find
words
tell
them
what
meant
him
see
them
all
ranged
there
his
side
Instead
smiled
raised
hand
farewell
turned
around
and
led
the
way
out
the
station
towards
the
sunlit
street
with
Uncle
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
hurrying
along
his
wake
