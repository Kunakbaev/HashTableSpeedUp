FOREWORD

This
tale
grew

Great

included

yet
more
ancient
history

some
years
desired
this
for

little

since

and
was

When
those
whose
advice
and

sought

PROLOGUE
Concerning
Hobbits
This
book
largely
concerned
with
Hobbits
and
from
its
pages
reader
may
discover
much
their
character
and
little
their
history
Further
information
will
also
found
the
selection
from
the
Red
Book
Westmarch
that
has
already
been
published
under
the
title
The
Hobbit
That
story
was
derived
from
the
earlier
chapters
the
Red
Book
composed
Bilbo
himself
the
first
Hobbit
become
famous
the
world
large
and
called
him
There
and
Back
Again
since
they
told
his
journey
into
the
East
and
his
return
adventure
which
later
involved
all
the
Hobbits
the
great
events
that
Age
that
are
here
related
Many
however
may
wish
know
more
about
this
markable
people
from
the
outset
while
some
may
not
possess
the
earlier
book
For
such
readers
few
notes
the
more
important
points
are
here
collected
from
Hobbit
lore
and
the
first
adventure
briefly
recalled
Hobbits
are
unobtrusive
but
very
ancient
people
more
numerous
formerly
than
they
are
today
for
they
love
peace
and
quiet
and
good
tilled
earth
well
ordered
and
well
farmed
countryside
was
their
favourite
haunt
They
not
and
did
not
understand
like
machines
more
complicated
than
forge
bellows
water
mill
hand
loom
though
they
were
skilful
with
tools
Even
ancient
days
they
were
rule
shy
the
Big
Folk
they
call
and
now
they
avoid
with
dismay
and
are
becoming
hard
find
They
are
quick
hearing
and
sharp
eyed
and
though
they
are
inclined
fat
and
not
hurry
unnecessarily
they
are
nonetheless
nimble
and
deft
their
movements
They
PROLOGUE
possessed
from
the
first
the
art
disappearing
swiftly
and
silently
when
large
folk
whom
they
not
wish
meet
come
blundering
and
this
art
they
have
developed
until
Men
may
seem
magical
But
Hobbits
have
never
fact
studied
magic
any
kind
and
their
elusiveness
due
solely
professional
skill
that
heredity
and
practice
and
close
friendship
with
the
earth
have
rendered
inimitable
bigger
and
clumsier
races
For
they
are
little
people
smaller
than
Dwarves
less
stout
and
stocky
that
even
when
they
are
not
actually
much
shorter
Their
height
variable
ranging
between
two
and
four
feet
our
measure
They
seldom
now
reach
three
feet
but
they
have
dwindled
they
say
and
ancient
days
they
were
taller
According
the
Red
Book
Bandobras
Took
Bullroarer
son
Isumbras
the
Third
was
four
foot
five
and
able
ride
horse
was
surpassed
all
Hobbit
records
only
two
famous
characters
old
but
that
curious
matter
dealt
with
this
book
for
the
Hobbits
the
Shire
with
whom
these
tales
are
concerned
the
days
their
peace
and
prosperity
they
were
merry
folk
They
dressed
bright
colours
being
notably
fond
yellow
and
green
but
they
seldom
wore
shoes
since
their
feet
had
tough
leathery
soles
and
were
clad
thick
curling
hair
much
like
the
hair
their
heads
which
was
commonly
brown
Thus
the
only
craft
little
practised
among
them
was
shoe
making
but
they
had
long
and
skilful
fingers
and
could
make
many
other
useful
and
comely
things
Their
faces
were
rule
good
natured
rather
than
beau
tiful
broad
bright
eyed
red
cheeked
with
mouths
apt
laughter
and
eating
and
drinking
And
laugh
they
did
and
eat
and
drink
often
and
heartily
being
fond
simple
jests
all
times
and
six
meals
day
when
they
could
get
them
They
were
hospitable
and
delighted
parties
and
presents
which
they
gave
away
freely
and
eagerly
accepted
plain
indeed
that
spite
later
estrangement
Hobbits
are
relatives
ours
far
nearer
than
Elves
even
than
Dwarves
old
they
spoke
the
languages
Men
after
their
PROLOGUE
own
fashion
and
liked
and
disliked
much
the
same
things
Men
did
But
what
exactly
our
relationship
can
longer
discovered
The
beginning
Hobbits
lies
far
back
the
Elder
Days
that
are
now
lost
and
forgotten
Only
the
Elves
still
preserve
any
records
that
vanished
time
and
their
traditions
are
concerned
almost
entirely
with
their
own
his
tory
which
Men
appear
seldom
and
Hobbits
are
not
men
tioned
all
Yet
clear
that
Hobbits
had
fact
lived
quietly
Middle
earth
for
many
long
years
before
other
folk
became
even
aware
them
And
the
world
being
after
all
full
strange
creatures
beyond
count
these
little
people
seemed
very
little
importance
But
the
days
Bilbo
and
Frodo
his
heir
they
suddenly
became
wish
their
own
both
important
and
renowned
and
troubled
the
counsels
the
Wise
and
the
Great
Those
days
the
Third
Age
Middle
earth
are
now
long
past
and
the
shape
all
lands
has
been
changed
but
the
regions
which
Hobbits
then
lived
were
doubtless
the
same
those
which
they
still
linger
the
North
West
the
Old
World
east
the
Sea
their
original
home
the
Hobbits
Bilbo
time
preserved
knowledge
love
learning
other
than
genealogical
lore
was
far
from
general
among
them
but
there
remained
still
few
the
older
families
who
studied
their
own
books
and
even
gathered
reports
old
times
and
distant
lands
from
Elves
Dwarves
and
Men
Their
own
records
began
only
after
the
settlement
the
Shire
and
their
most
ancient
legends
hardly
looked
further
back
than
their
Wandering
Days
clear
nonetheless
from
these
legends
and
from
the
evidence
their
peculiar
words
and
customs
that
like
many
other
folk
Hobbits
had
the
distant
past
moved
westward
Their
earliest
tales
seem
glimpse
time
when
they
dwelt
the
upper
vales
Anduin
between
the
eaves
Greenwood
the
Great
and
the
Misty
Mountains
Why

undertook
the
hard
and

shadow
that
fell
the
forest
that
became
darkened
and
its
new
name
was
Mirkwood
Before
the
crossing
the
mountains
the
Hobbits
had
already
become
divided
into
three
somewhat
different
breeds
Harfoots
Stoors
and
Fallohides
The
Harfoots
were
browner
skin
smaller
and
shorter
and
they
were
beardless
and
bootless
their
hands
and
feet
were
neat
and
nimble
and
they
preferred
highlands
and
hillsides
The
Stoors
were
broader
heavier
build
their
feet
and
hands
were
larger
and
they
preferred
flat
lands
and
riversides
The
Fallohides
were
fairer
skin
and
also
hair
and
they
were
taller
and
slimmer
than
the
others
they
were
lovers
trees
and
woodlands
The
Harfoots
had
much
with
Dwarves
ancient
times
and
long
lived
the
foothills
the
mountains
They
moved
westward
early
and
roamed
over
Eriador
far
Weathertop
while
the
others
were
still
Wilderland
They
were
the
most
normal
and
representative
variety
Hobbit
and
far
the
most
numerous
They
were
the
most
inclined
settle
one
place
and
longest
preserved
their
ancestral
habit
living
tunnels
and
holes
The
Stoors
lingered
long
the
banks
the
Great
River
Anduin
and
were
less
shy
Men
They
came
west
after
the
Harfoots
and
followed
the
course
the
Loudwater
south
wards
and
there
many
them
long
dwelt
between
Tharbad
and
the
borders
Dunland
before
they
moved
north
again
The
Fallohides
the
least
numerous
were
northerly
branch
They
were
more
friendly
with
Elves
than
the
other
Hobbits
were
and
had
more
skill
language
and
song
than
handicrafts
and
old
they
preferred
hunting
tilling
They
crossed
the
mountains
north
Rivendell
and
came
down
the
River
Hoarwell
Eriador
they
soon
mingled
with
the
other
kinds
that
had
preceded
them
but
being
somewhat
bolder
and
more
adventurous
they
were
often
found
leaders
chieftains
among
clans
Harfoots
Stoors
Even
Bilbo
time
the
strong
Fallohidish
strain
could
still
noted
among
the
greater
families

Tooks
and
the
Masters
Buckland
PROLOGUE
the
westlands
Eriador
between
the
Misty
Mountains
and
the
Mountains
Lune
the
Hobbits
found
both
Men
and
Elves
Indeed
remnant
still
dwelt
there
the
Dunedain
the
kings
Men
that
came
over
the
Sea
out
Westernesse
but
they
were
dwindling
fast
and
the
lands
their
North
King
dom
were
falling
far
and
wide
into
waste
There
was
room
and
spare
for
incomers
and
ere
long
the
Hobbits
began
settle
ordered
communities
Most
their
earlier
settle
ments
had
long
disappeared
and
been
forgotten
Bilbo
time
but
one
the
first
become
important
still
endured
though
reduced
size
this
was
Bree
and
the
Chetwood
that
lay
round
about
some
forty
miles
east
the
Shire
was
these
early
days
doubtless
that
the
Hobbits
learned
their
letters
and
began
write
after
the
manner
the
Dunedain
who
had
their
turn
long
before
learned
the
art
from
the
Elves
And
those
days
also
they
forgot
what
ever
languages
they
had
used
before
and
spoke
ever
after
the
Common
Speech
the
Westron
was
named
that
was
current
through
all
the
lands
the
kings
from
Arnor
Gondor
and
about
all
the
coasts
the
Sea
from
Belfalas
Lune
Yet
they
kept
few
words
their
own
well
their
own
names
months
and
days
and
great
store
personal
names
out
the
past
About
this
time
legend
among
the
Hobbits
first
becomes
history
with
reckoning
years
For
was
the
one
thou
sand
six
hundred
and
first
year
the
Third
Age
that
the
Fallohide
brothers
Marcho
and
Blanco
set
out
from
Bree
and
having
obtained
permission
from
the
high
king
Fornost
they
crossed
the
brown
river
Baranduin
with
great
following
Hobbits
They
passed
over
the
Bridge
Stonebows
that
had
been
built
the
days
the
power
the
North
Kingdom
and
they
took
all
the
land
beyond
dwell
between
the
river
and
the
Far
Downs
All
that
was
the
records
Gondor
relate
this
was
Argeleb
the
twentieth
the
Northern
line
which
came
end
with
Arvedui
three
hundred
years
later
PROLOGUE
demanded
them
was
that
they
should
keep
the
Great
Bridge
repair
and
all
other
bridges
and
roads
speed
the
king
messengers
and
acknowledge
his
lordship
Thus
began
the
Shire
reckoning
for
the
year
the
crossing
the
Brandywine
the
Hobbits
turned
the
name
became
Year
One
the
Shire
and
all
later
dates
were
reckoned
from
once
the
western
Hobbits
fell
love
with
their
new
land
and
they
remained
there
and
soon
passed
once
more
out
the
history
Men
and
Elves
While
there
was
still
king
they
were
name
his
subjects
but
they
were
fact
ruled
their
own
chieftains
and
meddled
not
all
with
events
the
world
outside
the
last
battle
Fornost
with
the
Witch
lord
Angmar
they
sent
some
bowmen
the
aid
the
king
they
maintained
though
tales
Men
record
But
that
war
the
North
Kingdom
ended
and
then
the
Hobbits
took
the
land
for
their
own
and
they
chose
from
their
own
chiefs
Thain
hold
the
authority
the
king
that
was
gone
There
for
thousand
years
they
were
little
troubled
wars
and
they
prospered
and
multiplied
after
the
Dark
Plague
until
the
disaster
the
Long
Winter
and
the
famine
that
followed
Many
thousands
then
perished
but
the
Days
Dearth
1158
were
the
time
this
tale
long
past
and
the
Hobbits
had
again
become
accustomed
plenty
The
land
was
rich
and
kindly
and
though
had
long
been
deserted
when
they
entered
had
before
been
well
tilled
and
there
the
king
had
once
had
many
farms
cornlands
vineyards
and
woods
Forty
leagues
stretched
from
the
Far
Downs
the
Brandywine
Bridge
and
fifty
from
the
northern
moors
the
marshes
the
south
The
Hobbits
named
the
Shire
the
region
the
authority
their
Thain
and
district
well
ordered
business
and
there
that
pleasant
corner
the

they
plied
their

Thus

heeded
less

less
the

dark
things
moved
until
they
came

that
peace
and
plenty
were
the
rule
Middle

and
the

They
forgot
ignored
what
little
they
had
ever
known
the

and
the

those
that
made

the
long
peace
the

They
were

had
Hobbits
any

warlike
and
they
had
never

olden
days
they
had
course
been
often
obliged

hard
world
but
Bilbo
time
that
was
very
ancient
history
The
last
battle
before
this
story
opens
and
indeed
the
only
one
that
had
ever
been
fought
within
the
borders
the
Shire
was
beyond
living
memory
the
Battle
Greenfields
1147
which
Bandobras
Took
routed

Even
the
weathers
had
grown
milder
and
the
wolves
that
had
once
come
ravening
out
the
North
bitter
white
winters
were
now
only
grandfather

though
there
was
still
some

weapons
the
Shire
these
were
used
mostly
trophies
hanging
above
hearths
walls
gathered
into
the
museum
Michel
Delving
The
Mathom
house
was
called
for
anything
that
Hobbits
had
immediate
use
for
but
were
unwilling
throw
away
they
called
mathom
Their
dwellings
were
apt
become
rather
crowded
with
mathoms
and
many
the
presents
that
passed
from
hand

were
that
sort
Nonetheless
ease
and
peace
had
left
this
people
still
curi
ously
tough
They
were
came
difficult
daunt

and
they
were
perhaps
unwearyingly
fond
good
things
not

because
they

way
that
astonished
those
who
did
not
know
them
well
and
looked
further
than
their
bellies
and
their
well

faces
Though
slow
quarrel
and
for
sport
killing
nothing
that
lived
they
were
doughty
bay
and
need
could
still
handle
arms
They
shot
well
with
the
bow
for
they
were
keen
eyed
and
sure
the
mark
Not
only
with
bows
and
PROLOGUE
arrows
any
Hobbit
stooped
for
stone
was
well
get
quickly
under

all

beasts
knew
very
well
All
Hobbits
had
originally
lived
holes
the
ground
they
believed
and
such
dwellings
they
still
felt
most
home
but
the
course
time
they
had
been
obliged
adopt
other
forms
abode
Actually
the
Shire
Bilbo
days
was
rule
only
the
richest
and
the
poorest
Hobbits
that
maintained
the
old
custom
The
poorest
went
living
burrows
the
most
primitive
kind
mere
holes
indeed
with
only
one
window
none
while
the
well
still
constructed
more
luxurious
versions
the
simple
diggings
old
But
suitable
sites
for
these
large
and
ramifying
tunnels
smials
they
called
them
were
not
everywhere
found
and
the
flats
and
the
low
lying
districts
the
Hobbits
they
multiplied
began
build
above

Cartwrights
and
others
that
sort
for
even
when
they
had

Hobbits
had
long
been
accustomed
build
sheds
and
workshops
The
habit
building
farmhouses
and
barns
was
said
have
begun
among
the
inhabitants
the
Marish
down
the
Brandywine
The
Hobbits
that
quarter
the

were
rather
large
and

into
the
Shire
from
south
away
and
they
still
had
many
peculiar
names
and
strange
words
not
found
elsewhere
the
Shire
probable
that
the
craft
building
many
other
crafts
beside
was
derived
from
the
Dunedain
But
the
Hobbits
may
have
learned
direct
from
the
Elves
the
teachers
Men
PROLOGUE
their
youth
For
the
Elves
the
High
Kindred
had
not
yet
forsaken
Middle
earth
and
they
dwelt
still
that
time
the
Grey
Havens
away
the
west
and
other
places
within
reach
the
Shire
Three
Elf
towers
immemorial
age
were
still
seen
the
Tower
Hills
beyond
the
western
marches
They
shone
far
off
the
moonlight
The
tallest
was
furthest
away
standing
alone
upon
green
mound
The
Hobbits
the
Westfarthing
said
that
one
could
see
the
Sea
from
the
top
that
tower
but
Hobbit
had
ever
been
known
climb
Indeed
few
Hobbits
had
ever
seen
sailed
upon
the
Sea
and
fewer
still
had
ever
returned
report
Most
Hobbits
regarded
even
rivers
and
small
boats
with
deep
misgivings
and
not
many
them
could
swim
And
the
days
the
Shire
lengthened
they
spoke
less
and
less
with
the
Elves
and
grew
afraid
them
and
distrustful
those
that
had
dealings
with
them
and
the
Sea
became
word
fear
among
them
and
token
death
and
they
turned
their
faces
away
from
the
hills
the
west
The
craft
building
may
have
come
from
Elves
Men
but
the
Hobbits
used
their
own
fashion
They
did
not
for
towers
Their
houses
were
usually
long
low
and
comfortable
The
oldest
kind
were
indeed
more
than
built
imitations
smials
thatched
with
dry
grass
straw
roofed
with
turves
and
having
walls
somewhat
bulged
That
stage
however
belonged
the
early
days
the
Shire
and
hobbit
building
had
long
since
been
altered
improved
devices
learned
from
Dwarves
discovered
themselves
preference
for
round
windows
and
even
round
doors
was
the
chief
remaining
peculiarity
hobbit
architecture
The
houses
and
the
holes
Shire
hobbits
were
often
large
and
inhabited
large
families
Bilbo
and
Frodo
Baggins
were
bachelors
very
exceptional
they
were
also
many
other
ways
such
their

with
the

Some

Tooks
Great
Smials
the
Brandybucks
Brandy

many
generations
relatives
lived
comparative
peace
together
one
ancestral
and
many
tunnelled

All
Hobbits
were
any
case
PROLOGUE
clannish
and
reckoned
their
relationships
with
great
care
They
drew
long
and
elaborate
family
trees
with
innumerable
branches
dealing
with
Hobbits
important
remember
who
related
whom
and
what
degree
would
impossible
this
book
set
out
family
tree
that
included
even
the
more
important
members
the
more
important
families
the
time
which
these
tales
tell
The
genealogical
trees
the
end
the
Red
Book
Westmarch
are
small
book
themselves
and
all
but
Hobbits
would
find
them
exceedingly
dull
Hobbits
delighted
such

they
were

they
liked

books
filled
with
things
that
they
already
knew
set
out
fair
and

with
contradictions
Concerning
Pipe
weed
There
another
astonishing
thing
about
Hobbits
old
that
must
mentioned
astonishing
habit
they
imbibed
inhaled
through
pipes
clay
wood
the
smoke
the
burning
leaves
herb
which
they
called
pipe
weed
leaf
variety
probably
Nicotiana
great
deal
mystery
surrounds
the
origin
this
peculiar
custom
art
the
Hobbits
preferred
call
All
that
could
discovered
about
antiquity
was
put
together
Meriadoc
Brandybuck
later
Master
Buckland
and
since
and
the
tobacco
the
Southfarthing
play
part
the
history
that
follows
his
remarks
the
introduction
his
Herblore
the
Shire
may
quoted
This
says
the
one
art
that
can
certainly
claim
our
own
invention
When
Hobbits
first
began
smoke
not
known
all
the
legends
and
family
histories
take
for
granted
for
ages
folk
the
Shire
smoked
various
herbs
some
fouler
some
sweeter
But
all
accounts
agree
that
Tobold
Hornblower
Longbottom
the
Southfarthing
first
grew
the
true
pipe
weed
his
gardens
the
days
Isengrim
the
Second

the
year
1070
Shire
reckoning
The
best
PROLOGUE
home
grown
still
comes
from
that
district
especially
the
varieties
now
known
Longbottom
Leaf
Old
Toby
and
Southern
Star
How
Old
Toby
came
the
plant
not
recorded
for
his
dying
day
would
not
tell
knew
much
about
herbs
but
was
traveller
said
that
his
youth
went
often
Bree
though
certainly
never
went
further
from
the
Shire
than
that
thus
quite
possible
that
learned
this
plant
Bree
where
now
any
rate
grows
well
the
south
slopes
the

The
Bree
hobbits
claim
have
been
the
first
actual
smokers
the
pipe
weed
They
claim
course
have
done
everything
before
the
people
the
Shire
whom
they
refer
colonists
but
this
case
their
claim
think
likely
true
And
certainly
was
from
Bree
that
the
art
smoking
the
genuine
weed
spread
the
recent
centuries
among
Dwarves
and
such
other
folk
Rangers
Wizards

ancient

thus
found
the
old

Bree
The
Prancing

has
been
kept
the
family
Butterbur
from
time
beyond
record
All
the
same
observations
that
have
made
own
many
journeys
south
have
convinced
that
the
weed
itself
not
native
our
parts
the
world
but
came
northward
from
the
lower
Anduin
whither
was
suspect
originally
brought
over

The

From
that

must
have

the
long
centuries
between
the

But
even
the

this
credit

Not

PROLOGUE
the
Ordering
the
Shire
The
Shire
was
divided
into
four
quarters
the
Farthings
already
referred
North
South
East
and
West
and
these
again
each
into
number
folklands
which
still
bore
the
names
some
the
old
leading
families
although
the
time
this
history
these
names
were
longer
found
only
their
proper
folklands
Nearly
all
Tooks
still
lived
the
Tookland
but
that
was
not
true
many
other
families
such
the
Bagginses
the
Boffins
Outside
the
Farthings
were
the
East
and
West
Marches
the
Buckland

and
the
Westmarch
added
the
Shire
1452
The
Shire
this
time
had
hardly
any
government
Families
for
the
most
part
managed
their
own
affairs
Grow
ing
food
and
eating
occupied
most
their
time
other
matters
they
were
rule
generous
and
not
greedy
but
contented
and
moderate
that
estates
farms
work
shops
and
small
trades
tended
remain
unchanged
for
generations
There
remained
course
the
ancient
tradition
concern
ing
the
high
king
Fornost
Norbury
they
called
away
north
the
Shire
But
there
had
been
king
for
nearly
thousand
years
and
even
the
ruins
Kings
Norbury
were
covered
with
grass
Yet
the
Hobbits
still
said
wild
folk
and
wicked
things
such
trolls
that
they
had
not
heard
the
king
For
they
attributed
the
king
old
all
their
essential
laws
and
usually
they
kept
the
laws
free
will
because
they
were
The
Rules
they
said
both
ancient
and
just
true
that
the
Took
family
had
long
been
pre
eminent
for
the
office
Thain
had
passed
them
from
the
Old
bucks
some
centuries
before
and
the
chief
Took
had
borne
that
title
ever
since
The
Thain
was
the
master
the
Shire
moot
and
captain
the
Shire
muster
and
the
Hobbitry
arms
but
muster
and
moot
were
only
held
times
emergency
which
longer
occurred
the
Thainship
had
ceased
more
than
nominal
dignity
The
Took
family
PROLOGUE
was
still
indeed
accorded
special
respect
for
remained
both
numerous
and
exceedingly
wealthy
and
was
liable
produce
every
generation
strong
characters
peculiar
habits
and
even
adventurous
temperament
The
latter
quali
ties
however
were
now
rather
tolerated
the
rich
than
generally
approved
The
custom
endured
nonetheless
referring
the
head
the
family
The
Took
and
adding
his
name
required
number
such
Isengrim
the
Second
for
instance
The
only
real
official
the
Shire
this
date
was
the
Mayor
Michel
Delving

who
was
elected
every
seven
years
the
Free
Fair
the
White
Downs
the
Lithe
that
Midsummer
mayor
almost
his
only
duty
was
preside
banquets
given
the
Shire
holidays
which
occurred
frequent
intervals
But
the
offices
Postmaster
and
First
Shirriff
were
attached
the
mayoralty
that
managed
both
the
Messenger
Service
and
the
Watch
These
were
the
only
Shire
services
and
the
Messengers
were
the
most
numerous
and
much
the
busier
the
two
means
all
Hobbits
were
lettered
but
those
who
were
wrote
constantly
all
their
friends
and
selection
their
relations
who
lived
further
off
than

walk
The
Shirriffs
was
the
name
that
the
Hobbits
gave
their
police
the
nearest
equivalent
that
they
possessed
They
had
course
uniforms
such
things
being
quite
known
only
feather
their
caps
and
they
were
practice
rather
haywards
than
policemen
more
concerned
with
the

did
not
make
themselves

the
time
when
this
story
begins
the
Bounders
they
were
called
had
been
greatly
increased
There
were
many
reports
and
complaints
strange
persons

prowling
about

the

that

and

long

Few
heeded
the

and
not
even
Bilbo
yet
had
any
notion

portended
Sixty
years
had

how

And
still

With

The

destroyed
Yet
though
before

the

and

more
than

the
Third

but
for
accident
the
way
The
party
was
assailed
Ores
high
pass
the
Misty
Mountains
they
went
towards
Wilderland
and
happened
that
Bilbo
was
lost
for
while
the
black

deep
under
the
mountains
and
there
groped
vain
the
dark
put
his
hand
ring
lying
the
floor
tunnel
put
his
pocket
seemed
then
like
mere
luck
Trying
find
his
way
out
Bilbo
went
down
the
roots
the
mountains
until
could
further
the
PROLOGUE
bottom
the
tunnel
lay
cold
lake
far
from
the
light
and
island
rock
the
water
lived
Gollum
was
loathsome
little
creature
paddled
small
boat
with
his
large
flat
feet
peering
with
pale
luminous
eyes
and
catching
blind
fish
with
his
long
fingers
and
eating
them
raw
ate
any
living
thing
even
ore
could
catch
and
strangle
without
struggle
possessed
secret
treasure
that
had
come
him
long
ages
ago
when
still
lived
the
light
ring
gold
that
made
its
wearer
invisible
was
the
one
thing
loved
his
Precious
and
talked
even
when
was
not
with
him
For
kept
hidden
safe
hole
his
island
except
when
was
hunting
spying
the
ores
the
mines
Maybe
would
have
attacked
Bilbo
once
the
ring
had
been
him
when
they
met
but
was
not
and
the
hobbit
held
his
hand
Elvish
knife
which
served
him
sword
gain
time
Gollum
challenged
Bilbo
the
Riddle
game
saying
that
asked
riddle
which
Bilbo
could
not
guess
then
would
kill
him
and
eat
him
but
Bilbo
defeated
him
then
would
Bilbo
wished
would
lead
him
way
out
the
tunnels
Since
was
lost
the
dark
without
hope
and
could
neither
nor
back
Bilbo
accepted
the
challenge
and
they
asked
one
another
many
riddles
the
end
Bilbo
won
the
game
more
luck
seemed
than
wits
for
was
stumped
last
for
riddle
ask
and
cried
out
his
hand
came
upon
the
ring
had
picked
and
forgotten
What
have
got
pocket
This
Gollum
failed
answer
though
demanded
three
guesses
The
Authorities
true
differ
whether
this
last
question
was
mere
question
and
not
riddle
according
the
strict
rules
the
Game
but
all
agree
that
after
accepting
and
trying
guess
the
answer
Gollum
was
bound
his
promise
And
Bilbo
pressed
him
keep
his
word
for
the
thought
came
him
that
this
slimy
creature
might
prove
false
even
though
such
promises
were
held
sacred
and
old
all
but
the
wickedest
things
feared
break
them
But
PROLOGUE
after
ages
alone
the
dark
Gollum
heart
was
black
and
treachery
was
slipped
away
and
returned
his
island
which
Bilbo
knew
nothing
not
far
off
the
dark
water
There
thought
lay
his
ring
was
hungry
now
and
angry
and
once
his
Precious
was
with
him
would
not
fear
any
weapon
all
But
the
ring
was
not
the
island
had
lost
was
gone
His
screech
sent
shiver
down
Bilbo
back
though
did
not
yet
understand
what
had
happened
But
Gollum
had
last
leaped
guess
too
late
What
has
got
its
pocketses
cried
The
light
his
eyes
was
like
green
flame
sped
back
murder
the
hobbit
and
recover
his
Precious
Just
time
Bilbo
saw
his
peril
and
fled
blindly
the
passage
away
from
the
water
and
once
more
was
saved
his
luck
For
ran
put
his
hand
his
pocket
and
the
ring
slipped
quietly
his
finger
was
that
Gollum
passed
him
without
seeing
him
and
went
guard
the
way
out
lest
the
thief
should
escape
Warily
Bilbo
fol
lowed
him
went
along
cursing
and
talking
himself
about
his
Precious
from
which
talk
last
even
Bilbo
guessed
the
truth
and
hope
came
him
the
darkness
himself
had
found
the
marvellous
ring
and
chance
escape
from
the
ores
and
from
Gollum
length
they
came
halt
before
unseen
opening
that
led
the
lower
gates
the
mines
the
eastward
side
the
mountains
There
Gollum
crouched
bay
smelling
and
listening
and
Bilbo
was
tempted
slay
him
with
his
sword
But
pity
stayed
him
and
though
kept
the
ring
which
his
only
hope
lay
would
not
use
help
him
kill
the
wretched
creature
disadvantage
the
end
gathering
his
courage
leaped
over
Gollum
the
dark
and
fled
away
down
the
passage
pursued
his
enemy
cries
hate
and
despair
Thief
thief
Baggins
hates
for
ever
Now
curious
fact
that
this
not
the
story
Bilbo
first
told
his
companions
them
his
account
was
that
Gollum
had
promised
give
him
present
won
the
PROLOGUE
game
but
when
Gollum
went
fetch
from
his
island
found
the
treasure
was
gone
magic
ring
which
had
been
given
him
long
ago
his
birthday
Bilbo
guessed
that
this
was
the
very
ring
that
had
found
and
had
won
the
game
was
already
his
right
But
being
tight
place
said
nothing
about
and
made
Gollum
show
him
the
way
out
reward
instead
present
This
account
Bilbo
set
down
his
memoirs
and
seems
never
have
altered
himself
not
even
after
the
Council
Elrond
Evidently
still
appeared
the
original
Red
Book
did
several
the
copies
and
abstracts
But
many
copies
contain
the
true
account
alternative
derived
doubt
from
notes
Frodo
Samwise
both
whom
learned
the
truth
though
they
seem
have
been
unwilling
delete
anything
actually
written
the
old
hobbit
himself
Gandalf
however
disbelieved
Bilbo
first
story
soon
heard
and
continued
very
curious
about
the
ring
Eventually
got
the
true
tale
out
Bilbo
after
much
questioning
which
for
while
strained
their
friendship
but
the
wizard
seemed
think
the
truth
important
Though
did
not
say
Bilbo
also
thought
important
and
disturbing
find
that
the
good
hobbit

LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
When
Bilbo
Baggins
Bag
End
announced
that
would
shortly
celebrating
his
eleventy
first
birthday
with
party
special
magnificence
there
was
much
talk
and
excitement
Hobbiton
Bilbo
was
very
rich
and
very
peculiar
and
had
been
the
wonder
the
Shire
for
sixty
years
ever
since
his
remarkable
disappearance
and
unexpected
return
The
riches
had
brought
back
from
his
travels
had
now
become
local
legend
and
was
popularly
believed
whatever
the
old
folk
might
say
that
the
Hill
Bag
End
was
full
tunnels
stuffed
with
treasure
And
that
was
not
enough
for
fame
there
was
also
his
prolonged
vigour
marvel
Time
wore
but
seemed
have
little
effect
Baggins
ninety
was
much
the
same
fifty
ninety
nine
they
began
call
him
well
preserved
but
unchanged
would
have
been
nearer
the
mark
There
were
some
that
shook
their
heads
and
thought
this
was
too
much
good
thing
seemed
unfair
that
anyone
should
possess
apparently
perpetual
youth
well
reputedly
inexhaustible
wealth
will
have
paid
for
they
said
isn
natural
and
trouble
will
come
But
far
trouble
had
not
come
and
Baggins
was
generous
with
his
money
most
people
were
willing
for
give
him
his
oddities
and
his
good
fortune
remained
visiting
terms
with
his
relatives
except
course
the
Sackville
Bagginses
and
had
many
devoted
admirers
among
the
hobbits
poor
and
unimportant
families
But
had
close
friends
until
some
his
younger
cousins
began
grow
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
The
eldest
these
and
Bilbo
favourite
was
young
Frodo
Baggins
When
Bilbo
was
ninety
nine
adopted
Frodo
his
heir
and
brought
him
live
Bag
End
and
the
hopes
the
Sackville
Bagginses
were
finally
dashed
Bilbo
and
Frodo
happened
have
the
same
birthday
September
22nd
You
had
better
come
and
live
here
Frodo
lad
said
Bilbo
one
day
and
then
can
celebrate
our
birthday
parties
comfortably
together
that
time
Frodo
was
still
his
tweens
the
hobbits
called
the
irresponsible
twenties
between
childhood
and
coming
age
thirty
three
Twelve
more
years
passed
Each
year
the
Bagginses
had
given
very
lively
combined
birthday
parties
Bag
End
but
now
was
understood
that
something
quite
exceptional
was
being
planned
for
that
autumn
Bilbo
was
going
eleventy
one
ill
rather
curious
number
and
very
spectable
age
for
hobbit
the
Old
Took
himself
had
only
reached
130
and
Frodo
was
going
thirty
three
important
number
the
date
his
coming
age
Tongues
began
wag
Hobbiton
and
Bywater
and
rumour
the
coming
event
travelled
all
over
the
Shire
The
history
and
character
Bilbo
Baggins
became
once
again
the
chief
topic
conversation
and
the
older
folk
suddenly
found
their
reminiscences
welcome
demand
one
had
more
attentive
audience
than
old
Flam
Gamgee
commonly
known
the
Gaffer
Fie
held
forth
The
Ivy
Bush
small
inn
the
Bywater
road
and
spoke
with
some
authority
for
had
tended
the
garden
Bag
End
for
forty
years
and
had
helped
old
Holman
the
same
job
before
that
Now
that
was
himself
growing
old
and
stiff
the
joints
the
job
was
mainly
carried
his
young
est
son
Sam
Gamgee
Both
father
and
son
were
very
friendly
terms
with
Bilbo
and
Frodo
They
lived

just

End
very
nice
well
spoken
gentlehobbit
Bilbo
always
said
the
Gaffer
declared
With
perfect
truth
for
Bilbo
was
very
polite
him
calling
him
Master
Hamfast
and
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
consulting
him
constantly
upon
the
growing
vegetables
the
matter
roots
especially
potatoes
the
Gaffer
was
recognized
the
leading
authority
all
the
neighbour
hood
including
himself
But
what
about
this
Frodo
that
lives
with
him
asked
Old
Noakes
Bywater
Baggins
his
name
but
more
than
half
Brandybuck
they
say
beats
why
any
Baggins
Hobbiton
should
looking
for
wife
away
there
Buckland
where
folks
are
queer
And
wonder
they
queer
put
Daddy
Twofoot
the
Gaffer
next
door
neighbour
they
live
the
wrong
side
the
Brandywine
River
and
right
agin
the
Old
Forest
That
dark
bad
place
half
the
tales
true
You
right
Dad
said
the
Gaffer
Not
that
the
Brandy
bucks
Buckland
live
the
Old
Forest
but
they
queer
breed
seemingly
They
fool
about
with
boats
that
big
river
and
that
isn
natural
Small
wonder
that
trouble
came
say
But
that
may
Frodo
nice
young
hobbit
you
could
wish
meet
Very
much
like
Bilbo
and
more
than
looks
After
all
his
father
was
Baggins
decent
respectable
hobbit
was
Drogo
Baggins
there
was
never
much
tell
him
till
was
drownded
Drownded
said
several
voices
They
had
heard
this
and
other
darker
rumours
before
course
but
hobbits
have
passion
for
family
history
and
they
were
ready
hear
again
Well
they
say
said
the
Gaffer
You
see
Drogo
married
poor
Miss
Primula
Brandybuck
She
was
our
Bilbo
first
cousin
the
mother
side
her
mother
being
the
youngest
the
Old
Took
daughters
and
Drogo
was
his
second
cousin
Frodo
his
first
and
second
cousin
once
removed
either
way
the
saying
you
follow
And
Drogo
was
staying
Brandy
Hall
with
his
father
law
old
Master
Gorbadoc
often
did
after
his
marriage
him
being
partial
his
vittles
and
old
Gorbadoc
keeping
mighty
generous
table
and
went
out
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE

boating
the
Brandywine
River
and
and
his
wife
were
drownded
and
poor
Frodo
only
child
and
all
heard
they
went
the
water
after
dinner
the
moonlight
said
Old
Noakes
and
was
Drogo
weight
sunk
the
boat
And
heard
she
pushed
him
and
pulled
her
after
him
said
Sandyman
the
Hobbiton
miller
You
shouldn
listen
all
you
hear
Sandyman
said
the
Gaffer
who
did
not
much
like
the
miller
There
isn
call
talking
pushing
and
pulling
Boats
are
quite
tricky
enough
for
those
that
sit
still
without
looking
further
for

Anyway
there
was
this
Frodo
left
orphan
and
stranded
you
might
say
among
those
queer
Bucklanders
being
brought
anyhow
Brandy

regular

all

Old

Gorbadoc
never
had
fewer
than
couple
hundred
relations
the
place
Bilbo
never
did
kinder
deed
than
when
brought
the
lad
back
live
among
decent
folk
But
reckon
was
nasty
knock
for
those
Sackville
Bagginses
They
thought
they
were
going
get
Bag
End
that
time
when
went
off
and
was
thought
dead
And
then
comes
back
and
orders
them
off
and
goes
living
and
living
and
never
looking
day
older
bless
him
And
suddenly
produces

and
has
all
the

now
too

has

hobbit
children
ran
after
the
cart
all
through
Hobbiton
and
right
the
hill
had
cargo
fireworks
they
rightly
guessed
Bilbo
front
door
the
old
man
began
unload
there
were
great
bundles
fireworks
all
sorts
and
shapes
each
labelled
with
large
red
and
the
elf
rune
That
was
Gandalf
mark
course
and
the
old
man
was
Gandalf
the
Wizard
whose
fame
the
Shire
was
due
mainly
his
skill
with
fires
smokes
and
lights
His
real
business
was
far
more
difficult
and
dangerous
but
the
Shire
folk
knew
nothing
about
them
was
just
one
the
attractions
the
Party
Hence
the
excitement
the
hobbit
children
for
Grand
they
shouted
and
the
old
man
smiled
They
knew
him
sight
though
only
appeared
Hobbiton
occasionally
and
never
stopped
long
but
neither
they
nor
any
but
the
oldest
their
elders
had
seen
one
his
firework
displays
they
now
belonged
legendary
past
When
the
old
man
helped
Bilbo
and
some
dwarves
had
finished
unloading
Bilbo
gave
few
pennies
away
but
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
not
single
squib
cracker
was
forthcoming
the
dis
appointment
the
onlookers
Run
away
now
said
Gandalf
You
will
get
plenty
when
the
time
comes
Then
disappeared
inside
with
Bilbo
and
the
door
was
shut
The
young
hobbits
stared
the
door
vain
for
while
and
then
made
off
feeling
that
the
day
the
party
would
never
come
Inside
Bag
End
Bilbo
and
Gandalf
were
sitting
the
open
window
small
room
looking
out
west
the
garden
The
late
afternoon
was
bright
and
peaceful
The
flowers
glowed
red
and
golden
snap
dragons
and
sunflowers
and
nasturtians
trailing
all
over
the
turf
walls
and
peeping
the
round
windows
How
bright
your
garden
looks
said
Gandalf
Yes
said
Bilbo
very
fond
indeed
and
all
the
dear
old
Shire
but
think
need
holiday
You
mean
with
your
plan
then
made
mind
months
ago
and
haven
changed
Very
well
good
saying
any
more
Stick
your
plan
your
whole
plan
mind
and
hope
will
turn
out
for
the
best
for
you
and
for
all
hope
Anyway
mean
enjoy
myself
Thursday
and
have
little
joke
Who
will
laugh
wonder
said
Gandalf
shaking
his
head
shall
see
said
Bilbo
The
next
day
more
carts
rolled
the
Hill
and
still
more
carts
There
might
have
been
some
grumbling
about
dealing
locally
but
that
very
week
orders
began
pour
out
Bag
End
for
every
kind
provision
commodity
luxury
that
could
obtained
Hobbiton
Bywater
anywhere
the
neighbourhood
People
became
enthusiastic
and
they
began
tick
off
the
days
the
calendar
and
they
watched
eagerly
for
the
postman
hoping
for
invitations
Before
long
the
invitations
began
pouring
out
and
the

was
blocked
and
the
Bywater

was
snowed

called
for
There

Even
those
who
had
pretended
have
Party
Business
were
seldom
allowed
inside
Bilbo
was
busy
writing
invitations
ticking
off
answers
packing
presents
and
making
some
private
preparations
his
own
From
the
time
Gandalf
arrival
remained
hidden
from
view
One
morning
the
hobbits
woke
find
the
large
field
south
Bilbo
front
door
covered
with
ropes
and
poles
for
tents
and
pavilions
special
entrance
was
cut
into
the
bank
leading
the
road
and
wide
steps
and
large
white
gate
were
built
there
The
three
hobbit
families
Bagshot
Row
adjoining
the
field
were
intensely
interested
and
generally
envied
Old
Gaffer
Gamgee
stopped
even
pretending
work
his
garden
The
tents
began
There
was
specially
large
pavilion
big
that
the
tree
that
grew
the
field
was
right
inside
and
stood
proudly
near
one
end
the
head
the
chief
table
Lanterns
were
hung
all
its
branches
More
promising

enormous

Bag
End
Excitement
rose
its
height
Then
the
weather
clouded
over
That
was
Wednesday
the
eve
the
Party
Anxiety
was
intense
Then
Thursday
September
the
22nd
actually
dawned
The
sun
got
the
clouds
vanished
flags
were
unfurled
and
the
fun
began
Bilbo
Baggins
called
party
but
was
really
variety
entertainments
rolled
into
one
Practically
everybody
living
near
was
invited
very
few
were
overlooked
accident
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
but
they
turned
all
the
same
that
did
not
matter
Many
people
from
other
parts
the
Shire
were
also
asked
and
there
were
even
few
from
outside
the
borders
Bilbo
met
the
guests
and
additions
the
new
white
gate
person
gave
away
presents
all
and
sundry
the
latter
were
those
who
went
out
again
back
way
and
came
again
the
gate
Hobbits
give
presents
other
people
their
own
birthdays
Not
very
expensive
ones
rule
and
not
lavishly
this
occasion
but
was
not
bad
system
Actually
Hobbiton
and
Bywater
every
day
the
year
was
somebody
birthday
that
every
hobbit
those
parts
had
fair
chance
least
one
present
least
once
week
But
they
never
got
tired
them
this
occasion
the
presents
were
unusually
good
The
hobbit
children
were
excited
that
for
while
they
almost
forgot
about
eating
There
were
toys
the
like
which
they
had
never
seen
before
all
beautiful
and
some
obviously
magi
cal
Many
them
had
indeed
been
ordered
year
before
and
had
come
all
the
way
from
the
Mountain
and
from
Dale
and
were
real
dwarf
make
When
every
guest
had
been
welcomed
and
was
finally
inside
the
gate
there
were
songs
dances
music
games
and
course
food
and
drink
There
were
three
official
meals
lunch
tea
and
dinner
supper
But
lunch
and
tea
were
marked
chiefly
the
fact
that
those
times
all
the
guests
were
sitting
down
and
eating
together
other
times
there
were
merely
lots
people
eating
and
drinking
continuously
from
elevenses
until
six
thirty
when
the
fireworks
started
The
fireworks
were
Gandalf
they
were
not
only
brought
him
but
designed
and
made
him
and
the
special
effects
set
pieces
and
flights
rockets
were
let
off
him
But
there
was
also
generous
distribution
squibs
crackers
backarappers
sparklers
torches
dwarf
candles
elf
fountains
goblin
barkers
and
thunder
claps
They
were
all
superb
The
art
Gandalf
improved
with
age
There
were
rockets
like
flight
scintillating
birds
singing
with
sweet
voices
There
were
green
trees
with
trunks
dark
THE

THE
RING
smoke
their
leaves
opened
like
whole
spring
unfolding
moment
and
their
shining
branches
dropped
glowing
flowers
down
upon
the
astonished
hobbits
disappearing
with
sweet
scent
just
before
they
touched
their
upturned
faces
There
were
fountains
butterflies
that
flew
glittering
into
the
trees
there
were
pillars
coloured
fires
that
rose
and
turned
into
eagles
sailing
ships
phalanx
flying
swans
there
was
red
thunderstorm
and
shower
yellow
rain
there
was
forest
silver
spears
that
sprang
suddenly
into
the
air
with
yell
like
embattled
army
and
came
down
again
into
the
Water
with
hiss
like
hundred
hot
snakes
And
there
was
also
one
last
surprise
honour
Bilbo
and
startled
the
hobbits
exceedingly
Gandalf
intended
The
lights
went
out
great
smoke
went
shaped
itself
like
mountain
seen
the
distance
and
began
glow
the
summit
spouted
green
and
scarlet
flames
Out
flew
red
golden
dragon
not
life
size
but
terribly
life
like
fire
came
from
his
jaws
his
eyes
glared
down
there
was
roar
and
whizzed
three
times
over
the
heads
the
crowd
They
all
ducked
and
many
fell
flat
their
faces
The
dragon
passed
like
express
train
turned
somersault
and
burst
over
Bywater
with
deafening
explosion
That
the
signal
for
supper
said
Bilbo
The
pain
and
alarm
vanished
once
and
the
prostrate
hobbits
leaped
their
feet
There
was
splendid
supper
for
everyone
for
everyone
that
except
those
invited

special

This
was

and
the

were
selected
from
all
the
families
which
Bilbo
and
Frodo
were
related
with
the
addition
few
special
unrelated
friends
such
Gandalf
Many
young

were
included
and

easy

LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
There
were
many
Bagginses
and
Boffins
and
also
many
Tooks
and
Brandybucks
there
were
various
Grubbs
lations
Bilbo
Baggins
grandmother
and
various
Chubbs
connexions
his
Took
grandfather
and
selection
Burrowses
Bolgers
Bracegirdles
Brockhouses
Goodbodies
Hornblowers
and
Proudfoots
Some
these
were
only
very
distantly
connected
with
Bilbo
and
some
had
hardly
ever
been
Hobbiton
before
they
lived
remote
corners
the
Shire
The
Sackville
Bagginses
were
not
forgotten
Otho
and
his
wife
Lobelia
were
present
They
disliked
Bilbo
and
detested
Frodo
but
magnificent
was
the
invitation
card
written
golden
ink
that
they
had
felt
was
impossible
refuse
Besides
their
cousin
Bilbo
had
been
specializing
food
for
many
years
and
his
table
had
high
reputation
All
the
one
hundred
and
forty
four
guests
expected
pleas
ant
feast
though
they
rather
dreaded
the
after
dinner
speech
their
host
inevitable
item
was
liable
drag
bits
what
called
poetry
and
sometimes
after
glass
two
would
allude
the
absurd
adventures
his
mysterious
journey
The
guests
were
not
disappointed
they
had
very
pleasant
feast
fact
engrossing
entertainment
rich
abundant
varied
and
prolonged
The
purchase
provisions
fell
almost
nothing
throughout
the
district
the
ensuing
weeks
but
Bilbo
catering
had
depleted
the
stocks
most
the
stores
cellars
and
warehouses
for
miles
around
that
did
not
matter
much
After
the
feast
more
less
came
the
Speech
Most
the
company
were
however
now
tolerant
mood
that
delightful
stage
which
they
called
filling
the
corners
They
were
sipping
their
favourite
drinks
and
nibbling
their
favourite
dainties
and
their
fears
were
forgotten
They
were
prepared
listen
anything
and
cheer

full

People
began
Bilbo
rising
his
place
Hear

they
shouted
and
kept
repeating
chorus
seeming
reluctant
follow
their
own
advice
Bilbo
left
his
place
and
went
and
stood

under
the
illuminated

The

and
they
ham

joyously
the

Bilbo
was
doing
splendidly
This
was
the
sort
stuff
they
liked
short
and
obvious
hope
you
are
all
enjoying
yourselves
much
Deaf
ening
cheers
Cries
Yes
and
Noises
trumpets
and

pipes
and
flutes
and
other

There
were
has
been
said
many
young
hobbits
present
Hun
dreds
musical
crackers
had
been
pulled
Most
them
bore
the
mark
dale
them
which
did
not
convey
much
most
the
hobbits
but
they
all
agreed
they
were
marvellous
crackers
They
contained
instruments
small
but
perfect
make
and
enchanting
tones
Indeed
one
corner
some
the
young
Tooks
and
Brandybucks
supposing
Uncle
Bilbo
have
finished
since
had
plainly
said

was

sary

got

and
with

began

pretty
dance
but
rather
vigorous
But
Bilbo
had
not
finished
Seizing

from

nearby
blew
three
loud
hoots
The
noise
subsided
shall
not
keep
you
long
cried
Cheers
from
all
the
assembly
have
called
you
all
together
for
Purpose
Something
the
way
that
said
this
made
impression
There
was
almost
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
silence
and
one
two
the
Tooks
pricked
their
ears
Indeed
for
Three
Purposes
First
all
tell
you
that
immensely
fond
you
all
and
that
eleventy
one
years
too
short
time
live
among
such
excellent
and
admirable
hobbits
Tremendous
outburst
approval
don
know
half
you
half
well
should
like
and
like
less
than
half
you
half
well
you
deserve
This
was
unexpected
and
rather
difficult
There
was
some
scattered
clapping
but
most
them
were
trying
work
out
and
see
came
compliment
Secondly
celebrate
birthday
Cheers
again
should
say
OUR
birthday
For
course
also
the
birthday
heir
and
nephew
Frodo
comes
age
and
into
his
inheritance
today
Some
perfunctory
clapping
the
elders
and
some
loud
shouts
Frodo
Frodo
Jolly
old
Frodo
from
the
juniors
The
Sackville
Bagginses
scowled
and
wondered
what
was
meant
coming
into
his
inheritance
Together
score
one
hundred
and
forty
four
Your
numbers
were
chosen
fit
this
remarkable
total
One

may
use
the
expression
cheers
This
was
ridiculous
Many
the
guests
and
especially
the
Sackville
Bagginses
were
insulted
feeling
sure
they
had
only
been
asked
fill

required
number

Long

though
the
fact
that
was
birthday
slipped
memory
that
occasion
was
only
fifty
one
then
and
birthdays
did
not
seem
important
The
banquet
was
very
splendid
however
though
had
bad
cold
the
time
remember
and
could
only
say
thag
you
very
buch
now
repeat
more
correctly
Thank
you
very
much
for
coming
little
party
Obstinate
silence
They
all
feared
that
song
some
poetry
was
now
immi
nent
and
they
were
getting
bored
Why
couldn
stop
talking
and
let
them
drink
his
health
But
Bilbo
did
not
sing
recite
paused
for
moment
Thirdly
and
finally
said
wish
make
THE

THE
RING
ANNOUNCEMENT
spoke
this
last
word
loudly
and
suddenly
that
everyone
sat
who
still
could
regret
announce
that
though

one
years
far
too
short
time
spend
among

GOOD
BYE
stepped
down
and
vanished
There
was
blinding
flash
light
and
the
guests
all
blinked
When
they
opened
their
eyes
Bilbo
was
nowhere
seen
One
hundred
and
forty
four
flabbergasted
hobbits
sat
back
speechless
Old
Odo
Proudfoot
removed
his
feet
from
the
table
and
stamped
Then
there
was
dead
silence
until
suddenly

Goodbody
Hornblower
and
Proudfoot

once
was
generally
agreed
that
the

was
very
bad
taste
and
more
food
and
drink
were
needed
cure
the
guests
shock
and
annoyance
mad
always
said
was
probably
the
most
popular
comment
Even
the
Tooks
with
few
exceptions
thought
Bilbo
behaviour
was
absurd
For
the
moment
most
them
took
for
granted
that
his
disappearance
was
nothing
more
than
ridiculous
prank
But
old
Rory
Brandybuck
was
not
sure
Neither
age
nor
enormous
dinner
had
clouded
his
wits
and
said
his
daughter
law
Esmeralda
There
something
fishy
this
dear
believe
that
mad
Baggins
off
again
Silly
old
fool
But
why
worry
hasn
taken
the
vittles
with
him
called
loudly
Frodo
send
the
wine
round
again
Frodo
was
the
only
one
present
who
had
said
nothing
For
some
time
had
sat
silent
beside
Bilbo
empty
chair
and
ignored
all
remarks
and
questions
had
enjoyed
the
joke
course
even
though
had
been
the
know
had
difficulty
keeping
from
laughter
the
indignant
surprise
the
guests
But
the
same
time
felt
deeply
troubled
realized
suddenly
that
loved
the
old
hobbit
dearly
Most
the
guests
went
eating
and
drinking
and
discussing
Bilbo
Baggins
oddities
past
and
present
but
the
Sackville
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
Bagginses
had
already
departed
wrath
Frodo
did
not
want
have
any
more
with
the
party
gave
orders
for
more
wine
served
then
got
and
drained
his
own
glass
silently
the
health
Bilbo
and
slipped
out
the
pavilion
for
Bilbo
Baggins
even
while
was
making
his
speech
had
been
fingering
the
golden
ring
his
pocket
his
magic
ring
that
had
kept
secret
for
many
years
stepped
down
slipped
his
finger
and
was
never
seen
any
hobbit
Hobbiton
again
walked
briskly
back
his
hole
and
stood
for
moment
listening
with
smile
the
din
the
pavilion
and
the
sounds
merrymaking
other
parts
the
field
Then
went
took
off
his
party
clothes
folded
and
wrapped
tissue
paper
his
embroidered
silk
waistcoat
and
put
away
Then
put
quickly
some
old
untidy
garments
and
fastened
round
his
waist
worn
leather
belt
hung
short
sword
battered
black
leather
scabbard
From
locked
drawer
smelling
moth
balls
took
out
old
cloak
and
hood
They
had
been
locked
they
were
very
precious
but
they
were
patched
and
weatherstained
that
their
original
colour
could
hardly
guessed
might
have
been
dark
green
They
were
rather
too
large
for
him
then
went
into
his
study
and
from
large
strong
box
took
out
bundle
wrapped
old
cloths
and
leather
bound
manuscript
and
also
large
bulky
envelope
The
book
and
bundle
stuffed
into
the
top
heavy
bag
that
was
standing
there
already
nearly
full
Into
the
enve
lope
slipped
his
golden
ring
and
its
fine
chain
and
then
sealed
and
addressed
Frodo
first
put
the
mantelpiece
but
suddenly
removed
and
stuck
his
pocket
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
Gandalf
came
quickly
Hullo
said
Bilbo
wondered
you
would
turn
glad
find
you
visible
replied
the
wizard
sitting
down
chair
wanted
catch
you
and
have
few
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
final
words
suppose
you
feel
that
everything
has
gone
off
splendidly
and
according
plan
Yes
said
Bilbo
Though
that
flash
was
surprising
quite
startled
let
alone
the
others
little
addition
your
own
suppose
was
You
have
wisely
kept
that
ring
secret
all
these
years
and
seemed
necessary
give
your
guests
something
else
that
would
seem
explain
your
sudden
vanishment
And
would
spoil
joke
You
are
interfering
old
busy
body
laughed
Bilbo
but
expect
you
know
best
usual
when
know
anything
But
don
feel
too
sure
about
this
whole
affair
has
now
come
the
final
point
You
have
had
your
joke
and
alarmed
offended
most
your
relations
and
given
the
whole
Shire
something

about
for
nine
days

Are

further
Yes

Probably

Why

you

what

like

been
scraped
over

That

Gandalf
looked
curiously
and
closely
him
does
not

said
thoughtfully
after
all

Well

LONG

Frodo

You

But

the

before

and
the
Mountains
but
still

Everything
said
Gandalf
The
ring
well
You
agreed
that
you
remember
Well
yes
suppose
stammered
Bilbo
Where
envelope
you
must
know
said
Bilbo
impatiently
There
the
mantelpiece
Well
Here
pocket
hesitated
Isn
that
odd
now
said
softly
himself
Yet
after
all
why
not
Why
shouldn
stay
there
Gandalf
looked
again
very
hard
Bilbo
and
there
was
gleam
his
eyes
think
Bilbo
said
quietly
should
leave
behind
Don
you
want
Well
yes
and
Now
comes
don
like
parting
with
all
may
say
And
don
really
see
why
should
Why
you
want
asked
and
curious
change
came
over
his
voice
was
sharp
with
suspicion
and
annoy
ance
You
are
always
badgering
about
ring
but
you
have
never
bothered
about
the
other
things
that
got
journey
but
had
badger
you
said
Gandalf
wanted
the
truth
was
important
Magic
rings
are
well
magical
and
they
are
rare
and
curious
was
professionally
interested
your
ring
you
may
say
and
still
should
like

where
you
wandering
again
Also
think
you
have
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
had
quite
long
enough
You
won
need
any
more
Bilbo
unless
quite
mistaken
Bilbo
flushed
and
there
was
angry
light
his
eyes
His
kindly
face
grew
hard
Why
not
cried
And
what
business
yours
anyway
know
what
with
own
things
own
found
came
Yes
yes
said
Gandalf
But
there
need
get
angry
your
fault
said
Bilbo
mine
tell
you
own
Precious
Yes
Precious
The
wizard
face
remained
grave
and
attentive
and
only
flicker
his
deep
eyes
showed
that
was
startled
and
indeed
alarmed
has
been
called
that
before
said
but
not
you
But
say
now
And
why
not
Even
Gollum
said
the
same
once
not
his
now
but
mine
And
shall
keep
say
Gandalf
stood
spoke
sternly
You
will
fool
you
Bilbo
said
You
make
that
clearer
with
every
word
you
say
has
got
far
too
much
hold
you
Let
And
then
you
can
yourself
and
free
choose
and
please
said
Bilbo
obstinately
Now
now
dear
hobbit
said
Gandalf
All
your
long
life
have
been
friends
and
you
owe
something
Come
you
promised
give
Well
you
want
ring
yourself
say
cried
Bilbo
But
you
won
get
won
give
Precious
away
tell
you
His
hand
strayed
the
hilt
his
small
sword
Gandalf
eyes
flashed
will
turn
get
angry
soon
said
you
say
that
again
shall
Then
you
will
see
Gandalf
the
Grey
uncloaked
took
step
towards
the
hobbit
and
seemed
grow
tall
and
menacing
his
shadow
filled
the
little
room
Bilbo
backed
away
the
wall
breathing
hard
his
hand
clutching
his
pocket
They
stood
for
while
facing
one
another
and
the
air
the
room
tingled
Gandalf
eyes
remained
bent
the
hobbit
Slowly
his
hands
relaxed
and
began
tremble
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
don
know
what
has
come
over
you
Gandalf
said
You
have
never
been
like
this
before
What
all
about
mine
isn
found
and
Gollum
would
have
killed
hadn
kept
not
thief
whatever
said
have
never
called
you
one
Gandalf
answered
And
not
one
either
not
trying
rob
you
but
help
you
wish
you
would
trust
you
used
turned
away
and
the
shadow
passed
seemed
dwindle
again
old
grey
man
bent
and
troubled
Bilbo
drew
his
hand
over
his
eyes
sorry
said
But
felt
queer
And
yet
would
relief
way
not
bothered
with
any
more
has
been
growing
mind
lately
Sometimes
have
felt
was
like
eye
looking
And
always
wanting
put
and
disappear
don
you
know
wondering
safe
and
pulling
out
make
sure
tried
locking
but
found
couldn
rest
without
pocket
don
know
why
And
don
seem
able
make
mind
Then
trust
mine
said
Gandalf
quite
made
away
and
leave
behind
Stop
possessing
Give
Frodo
and
will
look
after
him
Bilbo
stood
for
moment
tense
and
undecided
Presently
sighed
All
right
said
with
effort
will
Then
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
rather
ruefully
After
all
that
what
this
party
business
was
all
about
really
give
away
lots
birthday
presents
and
somehow
make
easier
give
away
the
same
time
hasn
made
any
easier
the
end
but
would
pity
waste
all
preparations
would
quite
spoil
the
joke
Indeed
would
take
away
the
only
point
ever
saw
the
affair
said
Gandalf
Very
well
said
Bilbo
goes
Frodo
with
all
the
rest
drew
deep
breath
And
now
really
must
starting
somebody
else
will
catch
have
said
good
bye
and
couldn
bear
all
over
again
picked
his
bag
and
moved
the
door
You
have
still
got
the
ring
your
pocket
said
the
wizard
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Well
have
cried
Bilbo
And
will
and
all
the
other
documents
too
You
had
better
take
and
deliver
for
That
will
safest
don
give
the
ring
said
Gandalf
Put
the
mantelpiece
will
safe
enough
there
till
Frodo
comes
shall
wait
for
him
Bilbo
took
out
the
envelope
but
just
was
about
set
the
clock
his
hand
jerked
back
and
the
packet
fell
the
floor
Before
could
pick
the
wizard
stooped
and
seized
and
set
its
place
spasm
anger
passed
swiftly
over
the
hobbit
face
again
Suddenly
gave
way
look
relief
and
laugh
Well
that
that
said
Now
off
They
went
out
into
the
hall
Bilbo
chose
his
favourite
stick
from
the
stand
then
whistled
Three
dwarves
came
out
different
rooms
where
they
had
been
busy
everything
ready
asked
Bilbo
Everything
packed
and
labelled
Everything
they
answered
Well
let
start
then
stepped
out
the
front
door
was
fine
night
and
the
black
sky
was
dotted
with
stars
looked
sniffing
the
air
What
fun
What
fun
off
again
off
the
Road
with
dwarves
This
what
have
really
been
longing
for
for
years
Good
bye
said
looking
his
old
home
and
bowing
the
door
Good
bye
Gandalf
Good
bye
for
the
present
Bilbo
Take
care
yourself
You
are
old
enough
and
perhaps
wise
enough
Take
care
don
care
Don
you
worry
about
happy
now
have
ever
been
and
that
saying
great
deal
But
the
time
has
come
being
swept
off
feet
last
added
and
then
low
voice
himself
sang
softly
the
dark
The
Road
goes
ever
and
Down
from
the
door
where
began
Now
far
ahead
the
Road
has
gone
And
must
follow
can
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
Pursuing
with
eager
feet
Until
joins
some
larger
way
Where
many
paths
and
errands
meet
And
whither
then
cannot
say
paused
silent
for
moment
Then
without
another
word
turned
away
from
the
lights
and
voices
the
field
and
tents
and
followed
his
three
companions
went
round
into
his
garden
and
trotted
down
the
long
sloping
path
jumped
over
low
place
the
hedge
the
bottom
and
took
the
meadows
passing
into
the
night
like
rustle
wind
the
grass
Gandalf
remained
for
while
staring
after
him
into
the
darkness
Good
bye
dear
Bilbo
until
our
next
meet
ing
said
softly
and
went
back
indoors
Frodo
came
soon
afterwards
and
found
him
sitting
the
dark
deep
thought
Has
gone
asked
Yes
answered
Gandalf
has
gone
last
wish
mean
hoped
until
this
evening
that
was
only
joke
said
Frodo
But
knew
heart
that
really
meant
always
used
joke
about
serious
things
wish
had
come
back
sooner
just
see
him
off
think
really
preferred
slipping
off
quietly
the
end
said
Gandalf
Don
too
troubled
all
right
now
left
packet
for
you
There
Frodo
took
the
envelope
from
the
mantelpiece
and
glanced
but
did
not
open
You
find
his
will
and
all
the
other
documents
there
think
said
the
wizard
You
are
the
master
Bag
End
now
And
also
fancy
you
find
golden
ring
The
ring
exclaimed
Frodo
Has
left
that
wonder
why
Still
may
useful
may
and
may
not
said
Gandalf
should
not
make
use
were
you
But
keep
secret
and
keep
safe
Now
going
bed
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
master
Bag
End
Frodo
felt
his
painful
duty
say
good
bye
the
guests
Rumours
strange
events
had
now
spread
all
over
the
field
but
Frodo
would
only
say
doubt
everything
will
cleared
the
morning
About
mid
night
carriages
came
for
the
important
folk
One
one
they
rolled
away
filled
with
full
but
very
unsatisfied
hobbits
Gardeners
came
arrangement
and
removed
wheel
barrows
those
that
had
inadvertently
remained
behind
Night
slowly
passed
The
sun
rose
The
hobbits
rose
rather
later
Morning
went
People
came
and
began
orders
clear
away
the
pavilions
and
the
tables
and
the
chairs
and
the
spoons
and
knives
and
bottles
and
plates
and
the
lanterns
and
the
flowering
shrubs
boxes
and
the
crumbs
and
cracker
paper
the
forgotten
bags
and
gloves
and
handker
chiefs
and
the
uneaten
food
very
small
item
Then
number
other
people
came
without
orders
Bagginses
and
Boffins
and
Bolgers
and
Tooks
and
other
guests
that
lived
were
staying
near
mid
day
when
even
the
best
fed
were
out
and
about
again
there
was
large
crowd
Bag
End
uninvited
but
not
unexpected
Frodo
was
waiting
the
step
smiling
but
looking
rather
tired
and
worried
welcomed
all
the
callers
but
had
not
much
more
say
than
before
His
reply
all
inquiries
was
simply
this
Air
Bilbo
Baggins
has
gone
away
far
know
for
good
Some
the
visitors
invited
come
inside
Bilbo
had
left
messages
for
them
Inside
the
hall
there
was
piled
large
assortment
packages
and
parcels
and
small
articles
furniture
every
item
there
was

tied
There
were
several

Bilbo
believed
that
she
had
acquired
good
many
his
spoons
while
was
away
his
former
journey
Lobelia
knew
that
quite
well
When
she
arrived
later
the
day
she
took
the
point
once
but
she
also
took
the
spoons
This
only
small
selection
the
assembled
presents
Bilbo
residence
had
got
rather
cluttered
with
things
the
course
his
long
life
was
tendency
hobbit
holes
get
cluttered
for
which
the
custom
giving
many
birthday
presents
was
largely
responsible
Not
course
that
the
birthday
presents
were
always
new
there
were
one
two
old
mathoms
forgotten
uses
that
had
circulated
all
around
the
district
but
Bilbo
had
usually
given
new
presents
and
kept
those
that
received
The
old
hole
was
now
being
cleared
little
Every
one
the
various
parting
gifts
had
labels
written
out
personally
Bilbo
and
several
had
some
point
some
joke
But
course
most
the
things
were
given
where
they
would
wanted
and
welcome
The
poorer
hobbits
and
especially
those
Bagshot
Row
did
very
well
Old
Gaffer
Gamgee

two
sacks
potatoes

now
quite
mature

been
laid

Bilbo

Rory
quite
forgave
Bilbo
and
voted
him
capital
fellow
after
the
first
bottle
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
There
was
plenty
everything
left
for
Frodo
And
course
all
the
chief
treasures
well
the
books
pictures
and
more
than
enough
furniture
were
left
his
possession
There
was
however
sign
nor
mention
money
jewel
lery
not
penny
piece
glass
bead
was
given
away
Frodo
had
very
trying
time
that
afternoon
false
rumour
that
the
whole
household
was
being
distributed
free
spread
like
wildfire
and
before
long
the
place
was
packed
with
people
who
had
business
there
but
could
not
kept
out
Labels
got
torn
off
and
mixed
and
quarrels
broke
out
Some
people
tried
swaps
and
deals
the
hall
and
others
tried
make
off
with
minor
items
not
addressed
them
with
anything
that
seemed
unwanted
unwatched
The
road
the
gate
was
blocked
with
barrows
and
handcarts
the
middle
the
commotion
the
Sackville
Bagginses
arrived
Frodo
had
retired
for
while
and
left
his
friend
Merry
Brandybuck
keep
eye
things
When
Otho
loudly
demanded
see
Frodo
Merry
bowed
politely
indisposed
said
resting
Hiding
you
mean
said
Lobelia
Anyway
want
see
him
and
mean
see
him
Just
and
tell
him
Merry
left
them
long
while
the
hall
and
they
had
time
discover
their
parting
gift
spoons
did
not
improve
their
tempers
Eventually
they
were
shown
into
the
study
Frodo
was
sitting
table
with
lot
papers
front
him
looked
indisposed
see
Sackville
Bagginses
any
rate
and
stood
fidgeting
with
something
his
pocket
But
spoke
quite
politely
The
Sackville
Bagginses
were
rather
offensive
They
began
offering
him
bad
bargain
prices
between
friends
for
various
valuable
and
unlabelled
things
When
Frodo
replied
that
only
the
things
specially
directed
Bilbo
were
being
given
away
they
said
the
whole
affair
was
very
fishy
Only
one
thing
clear
said
Otho
and
that
that
you
are
doing
exceedingly
well
out
insist
seeing
the
will
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
Otho
would
have
been
Bilbo
heir
but
for
the
adoption
Frodo
read
the
will
carefully
and
snorted
was
unfortunately
very
clear
and
correct
according
the
legal
customs
hobbits
which
demand
among
other
things
seven
signatures
witnesses
red
ink
Foiled
again
said
his
wife
And
after
waiting
sixty
years
Spoons
Fiddlesticks
snapped
his
fingers
under
Frodo
nose
and
stumped
off
But
Lobelia
was
not
easily
got
rid
little
later
Frodo
came
out
the
study
see
how
things
were
going
and
found
her
still
about
the
place
investigating
nooks
and
corners
and
tapping
the
floors
escorted
her
firmly
off
the
premises
after
had
relieved
her
several
small
but
rather
valuable
articles
that
had
somehow
fallen
inside
her
umbrella
Her
face
looked
she
was
the
throes
thinking
out
really
crushing
parting
remark
but
all
she
found
say
turning
round
the
step
was
You
five
regret
young
fellow
Why
didn
you
too
You
don
belong
here
you
Baggins
you
you
Brandybuck
Did
you
hear
that
Merry
That
was
insult
you
like
said
Frodo
shut
the
door
her
was
compliment
said
Merry
Brandybuck
and
course
not
true
Then
they
went
round
the
hole
and
evicted
three
young
hobbits
two
Boffins
and
Bolger
who
were
knocking
holes
the
walls
one
the
cellars
Frodo
also
had
tussle
with
young
Sancho
Proudfoot
old
Odo
Proudfoot
grandson
who
had
begun
excavation
the
larger
pantry
where
thought
there
was
echo
The
legend
Bilbo
gold
excited
both
curiosity
and
hope
for
legendary
gold
mysteriously
obtained
not
positively
ill
gotten
everyone
knows
anyone
for
the
finding
unless
the
search
interrupted
When
had
overcome
Sancho
and
pushed
him
out
Frodo
collapsed
chair
the
hall
time
close
the
shop
Merry
said
Lock
the
door
and
don
open
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
anyone
today
not
even
they
bring
battering
ram
Then
went
revive
himself
with
belated
cup
tea
had
hardly
sat
down
when
there
came
soft
knock
the
front
door
Lobelia
again
most
likely
thought
She
must
have
thought
something
really
nasty
and
have
come
back
again
say
can
wait
went
with
his
tea
The
knock
was
repeated
much
louder
but
took
notice
Suddenly
the
wizard
head
appeared
the
window
you
don
let
Frodo
shall
blow
your
door
right
down
your
hole
and
out
through
the
hill
said
dear
Gandalf
Half
minute
cried
Frodo
running
out
the
room
the
door
Come
Come
thought
was
Lobelia
Then
forgive
you
But
saw
her
some
time
ago
driving
pony
trap
towards
Bywater
with
face
that
would
have
curdled
new
milk
She
had
already
nearly
curdled
Honestly
nearly
tried
Bilbo
ring
longed
disappear
Don
that
said
Gandalf
sitting
down
careful
that
ring
Frodo
fact
partly
about
that
that
have
come
say
last
word
Well
what
about
What
you
know
already
Only
what
Bilbo
told
have
heard
his
story
how
found
and
how
used
his
journey
mean
Which
story
wonder
said
Gandalf
not
what
told
the
dwarves
and
put
his
book
said
Frodo
told
the
true
story
soon
after
came
live
here
said
you
had
pestered
him
till
told
you
had
better
know
too
secrets
between
Frodo
said
but
they
are
not
any
further
mine
anyway
That
interesting
said
Gandalf
Well
what
did
you
think
all
you
mean
inventing
all
that
about
present
well
thought
the
true
story
much
more
likely
and
couldn
see
LONG
EXPECTED
PARTY
the
point
altering
all
was
very
unlike
Bilbo
anyway
and
thought
rather
odd
did
But
odd
things
may
happen
people
that
have
such
treasures
they
use
them
Let
warning
you
very
careful
with
may
have
other
powers
than
just
making
you
vanish
when
you
wish
don
understand
said
Frodo
Neither
answered
the
wizard
have
merely
begun
wonder
about
the
ring
especially
since
last
night
need
worry
But
you
take
advice
you
will
use
very
seldom
not
all
least
beg
you
not
use
any
way
that
will
cause
talk
rouse
suspicion
say
again
keep
safe
and
keep
secret
You
are
very
mysterious
What
are
you
afraid
not
certain
will
say
more
may
able
tell
you
something
when
come
back
going
off
once
this
good
bye
for
the
present
got
once
cried
Frodo
Why
thought
you
were
staying
for
least
week
was
looking
forward
your
help
did
mean
but
have
had
change
mind
may
away
for
good
while
but
come
and
see
you
again
soon
can
Expect
when
you
see
shall
slip
quietly
shan
often
visiting
the
Shire
openly
again
find
that
have
become
rather
unpopular
They
say
nuisance
and
disturber
the
peace
Some
people
are
actu
ally
accusing
spiriting
Bilbo
away
worse
you
want
know
there
supposed
plot
between
you
and
get
hold
his
wealth
Some
people
exclaimed
Frodo
You
mean
Otho
and
Lobelia
How
abominable
would
give
them
Bag
End
and
everything
else
could
get
Bilbo
back
and
off
tramping
the
country
with
him
love
the
Shire
But
begin
wish
somehow
that
had
gone
too
wonder
shall
ever
see
him
again
said
Gandalf
And
wonder
many
other
things
Good
bye
now
Take
care
yourself
Look
out
for
especially
unlikely
times
Good
bye
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Frodo
saw
him
the
door
gave
final
wave
his
hand
and
walked
off
surprising
pace
but
Frodo
thought
the
old
wizard
looked
unusually
bent
almost
was
carrying
great
weight
The
evening
was
closing
and
his
cloaked
figure
quickly
vanished
into
the
twilight
Frodo
did
not
see
him
again
for
long
time
Chapter
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
The
talk
did
not
die
down
nine
even
ninety
nine
days
The
second
disappearance
Bilbo
Baggins
was
dis
cussed
Hobbiton
and
indeed
all
over
the
Shire
for
year
and
day
and
was
remembered
much
longer
than
that
became
fireside
story
for
young
hobbits
and
eventually
Mad
Baggins
who
used
vanish
with
bang
and
flash
and
reappear
with
bags
jewels
and
gold
became
favourite
character
legend
and
lived
long
after
all
the
true
events
were
forgotten
But
the
meantime
the
general
opinion
the
neighbour
hood
was
that
Bilbo
who
had
always
been
rather
cracked
had
last
gone
quite
mad
and
had
run
off
into
the
Blue
There
had
undoubtedly
fallen
into
pool
river
and
come
tragic
but
hardly
untimely
end
The
blame
was
mostly
laid
Gandalf
only
that
dratted
wizard
will
leave
young
Frodo
alone
perhaps
settle
down
and
grow
some
hobbit
sense
they
said
And
all
appearance
the
wizard
did
leave
Frodo
alone
and
did
settle
down
but
the
growth
hobbit
sense
was
not
very
noticeable
Indeed
once
began
carry
Bilbo
reputation
for
oddity
refused
into
mourning
and
the
next
year
gave
party
honour
Bilbo
hundred
and
twelfth
birthday
which
called
Hundred
weight
Feast
But
that
was
short
the
mark
for
twenty
guests
were
invited
and
there
were
several
meals
which
snowed
food
and
rained
drink
hobbits
say
Some
people
were
rather
shocked
but
Frodo
kept
the
custom
giving
Bilbo
Birthday
Party
year
after
year
until
they
got
used
said
that
did
not
think
Bilbo
was
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
dead
When
they
asked
Where
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
lived
alone
Bilbo
had
done
but
had
good
many
friends
especially
among
the
younger
hobbits
mostly
descendants
the
Old
Took
who
had
children
been
fond
Bilbo
and
often
and
out
Bag
End
Folco
Boffin
and
Fredegar
Bolger
were
two
these
but
his
closest
friends
were
Peregrin
Took
usually
called
Pippin
and
Merry
Brandybuck
his
real
name
was
Meriadoc
but
that
was
seldom
remembered
Frodo
went
tramping
over
the
Shire
with
them
but
more
often
wandered
himself
and
the
amazement
sensible
folk
was
sometimes
seen
far
from
home
walking
the
hills
and
woods
under
the
starlight
Merry
and
Pippin
suspected
that
visited
the
Elves
times
Bilbo
had
done
time
went
people
began
notice
that
Frodo
also
showed
signs
good
preservation
outwardly
retained
the
appearance
robust
and
energetic
hobbit
just
out
his
tweens
Some
folk
have
all
the
luck
they
said
but
was
not
until
Frodo
approached
the
usually
more
sober
age
fifty
that
they
began
think
queer
Frodo
himself
after
the
first
shock
found
that
being
his
own
master
and
the
Baggins
Bag
End
was
rather
pleasant
For
some
years
was
quite
happy
and
did
not
worry
much
about
the
future
But
half
unknown
himself
the
regret
that
had
not
gone
with
Bilbo
was
steadily
growing
found
himself
wondering
times
especially
the
autumn
about
the
wild
lands
and
strange
visions
mountains
that
had
never
seen
came
into
his
dreams
began
say
himself
Perhaps
shall
cross
the
River
myself
one
day
which
the
other
half
his
mind
always
replied
Not
yet
went
until
his
forties
were
running
out
and
his
fiftieth
birthday
was
drawing
near
fifty
was
number
that
felt
was
somehow
significant
ominous
was
any
rate
that
age
that
adventure
had
suddenly
befallen
Bilbo
Frodo
began
feel
restless
and
the
old
paths
seemed
too
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
well
trodden
looked
maps
and
wondered
what
lay
beyond
their
edges
maps
made
the
Shire
showed
mostly
white
spaces
beyond
its
borders
took
wandering
further
afield
and
more
often
himself
and
Merry
and
his
other
friends
watched
him
anxiously
Often
was
seen
walking
and
talking
with
the
strange
wayfarers
that
began
this
time
appear
the
Shire
There
were
rumours
strange
things
happening
the
world
outside
and
Gandalf
had
not
that
time
appeared
sent
any
message
for
several
years
Frodo
gathered
all
the
news
could
Elves
who
seldom
walked
the
Shire
could
now
seen
passing
westward
through
the
woods
the
evening
passing
and
not
returning
but
they
were
leaving
Middle
earth
and
were
longer
concerned
with
its
troubles
There
were
however
dwarves
the
road
unusual
numbers
The
ancient
East
West
Road
ran
through
the
Shire
its
end
the
Grey
Havens
and
dwarves
had
always
used
their
way
their
mines
the
Blue
Mountains
They
were
the
hobbits
chief
source
news
from
distant
parts
they
wanted
any
rule
dwarves
said
little
and
hobbits
asked
more
But
now
Frodo
often
met
strange
dwarves
far
countries
seeking
refuge
the
West
They
were
troubled
and
some
spoke
whispers
the
Enemy
and
the
Land
Mordor
That
name
the
hobbits
only
knew
legends
the
dark
past
like
shadow
the
background
their
memories
but
was
ominous
and
disquieting
seemed
that
the
evil
power
Mirkwood
had
been
driven
out
the
White
Council
only
reappear
greater
strength
the
old
strongholds
Mordor
The
Dark
Tower
had
been
rebuilt
was
said
From
there
the
power
was
spreading
far
and
wide
and
away
far
east
and
south
there
were
wars
and
growing
fear
Ores
were
multiplying
again
the
mountains
Trolls
were
abroad
longer
dull
witted
but
cunning
and
armed
with
dreadful
weapons
And
there
were
murmured
hints
creatures
more
terrible
than
all
these
but
they
had
name
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Little
all
this
course
reached
the
ears
ordinary
hobbits
But
even
the
deafest
and
most
stay
home
began
hear
queer
tales
and
those
whose
business
took
them
the
borders
saw
strange
things
The
conversation
The
Green
Dragon
Bywater
one
evening
the
spring
Frodo
fiftieth
year
showed
that
even
the
comfortable
heart
the
Shire
rumours
had
been
heard
though
most
hobbits
still
laughed
them
Sam
Gamgee
was
sitting
one
corner
near
the
fire
and
opposite
him
was
Ted
Sandyman
the
miller
son
and
there
were
various
other
rustic
hobbits
listening
their
talk
Queer
things
you
hear
these
days
sure
said
Sam
said
Ted
you
you
listen
But
can
hear
fireside
tales
and
children
stories
home
want
doubt
you
can
retorted
Sam
and
daresay
there
more
truth
some
them
than
you
reckon
Who
invented
the
stories
anyway
Take
dragons
now
thank
said
Ted
won
heard
tell
them
when
was
youngster
but
there
call
believe
them
now
There
only
one
Dragon
Bywater
and
that
Green
said
getting
general
laugh
All
right
said
Sam
laughing
with
the
rest
But
what
about
these
Tree
men
these
giants
you
might
call
them
They
say
that
one
bigger
than
tree
was
seen
away
beyond
the
North
Moors
not
long
back
Who
they
cousin
Hal
for
one
works
for
Boffin
Overhill
and
goes
the
Northfarthing
for
the
hunting
saw
one
Says
did
perhaps
Your
Hal
always
saying
seen
things
and
maybe
sees
things
that
ain
there
But
this
one
was
big
elm
tree
and
walking
walking
seven
yards
stride
was
inch
Then
bet
wasn
inch
What
saw
was
elm
tree
like
not
But
this
one
was
walking
tell
you
and
there
ain
elm
tree
the
North
Moors
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
Then
Hal
can
have
seen
one
said
Ted
There
was
some
laughing
and
clapping
the
audience
seemed
think
that
Ted
had
scored
point
All
the
same
said
Sam
you
can
deny
that
others
besides
our
Halfast
have
seen
queer
folk
crossing
the
Shire
crossing
mind
you
there
are
more
that
are
turned
back
the
borders
The
Bounders
have
never
been
busy
before
And
heard
tell
that
Elves
are
moving
west
They
say
they
are
going
the
harbours
out
away
beyond
the
White
Towers
Sam
waved
his
arm
vaguely
neither
nor
any
them
knew
how
far
was
the
Sea
past
the
old
towers
beyond
the
western
borders
the
Shire
But
was
old
tradition
that
away
over
there
stood
the
Grey
Havens
from
which
times
elven
ships
set
sail
never
return
They
are
sailing
sailing
sailing
over
the
Sea
they
are
going
into
the
West
and
leaving
said
Sam
half
chanting
the
words
shaking
his
head
sadly
and
solemnly
But
Ted
laughed
Well
that
isn
anything
new
you
believe
the
old
tales
And
don
see
what
matters
you
Let
them
sail
But
warrant
you
haven
seen
them
doing
nor
anyone
else
the
Shire
Well
don
know
said
Sam
thoughtfully
believed
had
once
seen
Elf
the
woods
and
still
hoped
see
more
one
day
all
the
legends
that
had
heard
his
early
years
such
fragments
tales
and
half
remembered
stories
about
the
Elves
the
hobbits
knew
had
always
moved
him
most
deeply
There
are
some
even
these
parts
know
the
Fair
Folk
and
get
news
them
said
There
Baggins
now
that
work
for
told
that
they
were
sailing
and
knows
bit
about
Elves
And
old
Bilbo
knew
more
many
the
talk
had
with
him
when
was
little
lad
they
both
cracked
said
Ted
Leastways
old
Bilbo
was
cracked
and
Frodo
cracking
that
where
you
get
your
news
from
you
never
want
for
moonshine
Well
friends
off
home
Your
good
health
drained
his
mug
and
went
out
noisily
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Sam
sat
silent
and
said
more
had
good
deal
think
about
For
one
thing
there
was
lot
the
Bag
End
garden
and
would
have
busy
day
tomorrow
the
weather
cleared
The
grass
was
growing
fast
But
Sam
had
more
his
mind
than
gardening
After
while
sighed
and
got
and
went
out
was
early
April
and
the
sky
was
now
clearing
after
heavy
rain
The
sun
was
down
and
cool
pale
evening
was
quietly
fading
into
night
walked
home
under
the
early
stars
through
Hobbiton
and
the
Hill
whistling
softly
and
thoughtfully
was
just
this
time
that
Gandalf
reappeared
after
his
long
absence
For
three
years
after
the
Party
had
been
away
Then
paid
Frodo
brief
visit
and
after
taking
good
look
him
went
off
again
During
the
next
year
two
had
turned
fairly
often
coming
unexpectedly
after
dusk
and
going
off
without
warning
before
sunrise
would
not
discuss
his
own
business
and
journeys
and
seemed
chiefly
interested
small
news
about
Frodo
health
and
doings
Then
suddenly
his
visits
had
ceased
was
over
nine
years
since
Frodo
had
seen
heard
him
and
had
begun
think
that
the
wizard
would
never
return
and
had
given
all
interest
hobbits
But
that
evening
Sam
was
walking
home
and
twilight
was
fading
there
came
the
once
familiar
tap
the
study
window
Frodo
welcomed
his
old
friend
with
surprise
and
great
delight
They
looked
hard
one
another
All
well
said
Gandalf
You
look
the
same
ever
Frodo
you
Frodo
replied
but
secretly
thought
that
Gandalf
looked
older
and
more
careworn
pressed
him
for
news
himself
and
the
wide
world
and
soon
they
were
deep
talk
and
they
stayed
far
into
the
night
Next
morning
after
late
breakfast
the
wizard
was
sitting
with
Frodo
the
open
window
the
study
bright
fire
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
was
the
hearth
but
the
sun
was
warm
and
the
wind
was
the
South
Everything
looked
fresh
and
the
new
green
spring
was
shimmering
the
fields
and
the
tips
the
trees
fingers
Gandalf
was
thinking
spring
nearly
eighty
years
before
when
Bilbo
had
run
out
Bag
End
without
hand
kerchief
His
hair
was
perhaps
whiter
than
had
been
then
and
his
beard
and
eyebrows
were
perhaps
longer
and
his
face
more
lined
with
care
and
wisdom
but
his
eyes
were
bright
ever
and
smoked
and
blew
smoke
rings
with
the
same
vigour
and
delight
was
smoking
now
silence
for
Frodo
was
sitting
still
deep
thought
Even
the
light
morning
felt
the
dark
shadow
the
tidings
that
Gandalf
had
brought
last
broke
the
silence
Last
night
you
began
tell
strange
things
about
ring
Gandalf
said
And
then
you
stopped
because
you
said
that
such
matters
were
best
left
until
daylight
Don
you
think
you
had
better
finish
now
You
say
the
ring
danger
ous
far
more
dangerous
than
guess
what
way
many
ways
answered
the
wizard
far
more
power
ful
than
ever
dared
think
first
powerful
that
the
end
would
utterly
overcome
anyone
mortal
race
who
possessed
would
possess
him
Eregion
long
ago
many
Elven
rings
were
made
magic
rings
you
call
them
and
they
were
course
various
kinds
some
more
potent
and
some
less
The
lesser
rings
were
only
essays
the
craft
before
was
full
grown
and
the
Elven
smiths
they
were
but
trifles
yet
still
mind
dangerous
for
mortals
But
the
Great
Rings
the
Rings
Power
they
were
perilous
mortal
Frodo
who
keeps
one
the
Great
Rings
does
not
die
but
does
not
grow
obtain
more
life
merely
continues
until
last
every
minute
weariness
And
often
uses
the
Ring
make
himself
invisible
fades
becomes
the
end
invisible
permanently
and
walks
the
twilight
under
the
eye
the
Dark
Power
that
rules
the
Rings
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
sooner
later
later
strong
well
meaning
begin
with
but
neither
strength
nor
good
purpose
will
last
sooner
later
the
Dark
Power
will
devour
him
How
terrifying
said
Frodo
There
was
another
long
silence
The
sound
Sam
Gamgee
cutting
the
lawn
came
from
the
garden
How
long
have
you
known
this
asked
Frodo
length
And
how
much
did
Bilbo
know
Bilbo
knew
more
than
told
you
sure
said
Gandalf
would
certainly
never
have
passed
you
anything
that
thought
would
danger
even
though
promised
look
after
you
thought
the
ring
was
very
beautiful
and
very
useful
need
and
anything
was
wrong
queer
was
himself
said
that
was
growing
his
mind
and
was
always
worrying
about
but
did
not
suspect
that
the
ring
itself
was
blame
Though
had
found
out
that
the
thing
needed
looking
after
did
not
seem
always
the
same
size
weight
shrank
expanded
odd
way
and
might
suddenly
slip
off
finger
where
had
been
tight
Yes
warned
that
his
last
letter
said
Frodo
have
always
kept
its
chain
Very
wise
said
Gandalf
But
for
his
long
life
Bilbo
never
connected
with
the
ring
all
took
all
the
credit
for
that
himself
and
was
very
proud
Though
was
getting
restless
and
uneasy
Thin
and
stretched
said
sign
that
the
ring
was
getting
control
How
long
have
you
known
all
this
asked
Frodo
again
Known
said
Gandalf
have
known
much
that
only
the
Wise
know
Frodo
But
you
mean
known
about
this
ring
well
still
not
know
one
might
say
There
last
test
make
But
longer
doubt
guess
When
did
first
begin
guess
mused
searching
back
memory
Let
see
was
the
year
that
the
White
Council
drove
the
Dark
Power
from
Mirkwood
just
before
the
Battle
Five
Armies
that
Bilbo
found
his
ring
shadow
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
fell
heart
then
though
did
not
know
yet
what
feared
wondered
often
how
Gollum
came
Great
Ring
plainly
was
that
least
was
clear
from
the
first
Then
heard
Bilbo
strange
story
how
had
won
and
could
not
believe
When
last
got
the
truth
out
him
saw
once
that
had
been
trying
put
his
claim
the
ring
beyond
doubt
Much
like
Gollum
with
his
birthday
present
The
lies
were
too
much
alike
for
comfort
Clearly
the
ring
had
unwholesome
power
that
set
work
its
keeper
once
That
was
the
first
real
warning
had
that
all
was
not
well
told
Bilbo
often
that
such
rings
were
better
left
unused
but
resented
and
soon
got
angry
There
was
little
else
that
could
could
not
take
from
him
without
doing
greater
harm
and
had
right
anyway
could
only
watch
and
wait
might
perhaps
have
consulted
Saruman
the
White
but
something
always
held
back
Who
asked
Frodo
have
never
heard
him
before
Maybe
not
answered
Gandalf
Hobbits
are
were
concern
his
Yet
great
among
the
Wise
the
chief
order
and
the
head
the
Council
His
knowledge
deep
but
his
pride
has
grown
with
and
takes
ill
any
meddling
The
lore
the
Elven
rings
great
and
small
his
province
has
long
studied
seeking
the
lost
secrets
their
making
but
when
the
Rings
were
debated
the
Coun
cil
all
that
would
reveal
his
ring
lore
told
against
fears
doubt
slept
but
uneasily
Still
watched
and
waited
And
all
seemed
well
with
Bilbo
And
the
years
passed
Yes
they
passed
and
they
seemed
not
touch
him
showed
signs
age
The
shadow
fell
again
But
said
myself
After
all
comes
long
lived
family
his
mother
side
There
time
yet
Wait
And
waited
Until
that
night
when
left
this
house
said
and
did
things
then
that
filled
with
fear
that
words
Saruman
could
allay
knew
last
that
something
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
dark
and
deadly
was
work
And
have
spent
most
the
years
since
then
finding
out
the
truth
There
wasn
any
permanent
harm
done
was
there
asked
Frodo
anxiously
would
get
all
right
time
wouldn
able
rest
peace
mean
felt
better
once
said
Gandalf
But
there
only
one
Power
this
world
that
knows
all
about
the
Rings
and
their
effects
and
far
know
there
Power
the
world
that
knows
all
about
hobbits
Among
the
Wise
the
only
one
that
goes
for
hobbit
lore
obscure
branch
knowledge
but
full
surprises
Soft
butter
they
can
and
yet
sometimes
tough
old
tree

think
likely
that
some
would
resist
the
Rings
far
longer
than
most
the
Wise
would
believe
don
think
you
need
worry
about
Bilbo
course
possessed
the
ring
for
many
years
and
used

take
long
while
for
the
influence

was

Otherwise

years
quite
happily

important
point
was
not
troubled
about
dear
Bilbo
any
more
once
had
let
the
thing
for
you
that
feel
responsible
Ever
since
Bilbo
left
have
been
deeply
concerned
about
you
and
about
all
these
charming
absurd
helpless
hobbits

grievous
blow

Bolgers

Bracegirdles
and
the
rest
not
mention
the
ridiculous
Bagginses
became
enslaved
Frodo
shuddered
But
why
should
asked
And
why
should
want
such
slaves
tell
you
the
truth
replied
Gandalf
believe
that
hitherto
hitherto
mark
you
has
entirely
overlooked
the
existence
hobbits
You
should
thankful
But
your
safety
has
passed
does
not

you

many
more
useful
servants
but
won
forget
you
again
And
hobbits
miserable

would
please
him
far
more
than
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
hobbits
happy
and
free
There
such
thing
malice
and
revenge
Revenge
said
Frodo
Revenge
for
what
still
don
understand
what
all
this
has
with
Bilbo
and
myself
and
our
ring
has
everything
with
said
Gandalf
You
not
know
the
real
peril
yet
but
you
shall
was
not
sure
myself
when
was
last
here
but
the
time
has
come
speak
Give
the
ring
for
moment
Frodo
took
from
his
breeches
pocket
where
was
clasped
chain
that
hung
from
his
belt
Fie
unfastened
and
handed
slowly
the
wizard
felt
suddenly
very
heavy
either
Frodo
himself
was
some
way
reluc
tant
for
Gandalf
touch
Gandalf
held
looked
made
pure
and
solid
gold
Can
you
see
any
markings
asked
said
Frodo
There
are
none
quite
plain
and
never
shows
scratch
sign
wear
Well
then
look
Frodo
astonishment
and
distress
the
wizard
threw
suddenly
into
the
middle
glowing
corner
the
fire
Frodo
gave
cry
and
groped
for
the
tongs
but
Gandalf
held
him
back
Wait
said
commanding
voice
giving
Frodo
quick
look
from
under
his
bristling
brows
apparent
change
came
over
the
ring
After
while
Gandalf
got
closed
the
shutters
outside
the
window
and
drew
the
curtains
The
room
became
dark
and
silent
though
the
clack
Sam
shears
now
nearer
the
windows
could
still
heard
faintly
from
the
garden
For
moment
the
wizard
stood
looking
the
fire
then
stooped
and
removed
the
ring
the
hearth
with
the
tongs
and
once
picked
Frodo
gasped
quite
cool
said
Gandalf
Take
Frodo
received
his
shrinking
palm
seemed
have
become
thicker
and
heavier
than
ever
Hold
said
Gandalf
And
look
closely
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Frodo
did
now
saw
fine
lines
finer
than
the
finest
pen
strokes
running
along
the
ring
outside
and
inside
lines

that
seemed
form
the

They

Frodo

said
Gandalf
but

The

are
Elvish

not
utter
here
But

said
close

This

How

Gandalf
That

The

Black
Years
which
only
the

now
remember
were
tell
you

that

here
when
Spring
had
passed
into
Winter
But
last
night
told
you
Sauron

Great
the
Dark
Lord
The
rumours
that
you
have
heard
are
true
has
indeed
arisen
again
and
left
his
hold
Mirkwood
and
returned
his
ancient
fastness
the
Dark
Tower
Mordor
That
name
even
you
hobbits
have
heard
like
shadow
the
borders
old
stories
Always
after
defeat
and
respite
the
Shadow
takes
another
shape
and
grows
again

Frodo

Gandalf

all
who

But

All

And
already
Frodo

The

His

but
they
are
ripening

The

terrible

Long

many
year
since
the
Nine
walked
abroad
Yet
who
knows
the

once
more
they
too
may
walk
again
But
come
will
not

such
things
even
the
morning
the
Shire
now
the

gathered

they

The

But

and

And
this
the
dreadful
chance
Frodo
believed
that
the

had
perished
that
the
Elves
had

have
been
done
But
knows
now
that
has
not

seeking

all
his
thought
bent

great
hope
and
our
great
fear
Why
why

cried
Frodo
And
how
did
the
Enemy
ever
come
lose

strong
and
was
precious
him
clutched
the
Ring
his
hand
saw
already
dark
fingers
stretching
out
seize
was
taken
from
him
said
Gandalf
The
strength
the
Elves
resist
him
was
greater
long
ago
and
not
all
Men
were
estranged
from
them
The
Men
Westernesse
came
their
aid
That
chapter
ancient
history
which
might
good
recall
for
there
was
sorrow
then
too
and
gathering
dark
but
great
valour
and
great
deeds
that
were
not
wholly
vain
One
day
perhaps
will
tell
you
all
the
tale
you
shall
hear
told
full
one
who
knows
best
But
for
the
moment
since
most
all
you
need
know
how
this
thing
came
you
and
that
will
tale
enough
this
all
that
will
say
was
Gil
galad
Elven
king
and
Elendil
Westernesse
who
overthrew
Sauron
though
they
themselves
perished
the
deed
and
Isildur
Elendil
son
cut
the
Ring
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
from
Sauron
hand
and
took
for
his
own
Then
Sauron
was
vanquished
and
his
spirit
fled
and
was
hidden
for
long
years
until
his
shadow
took
shape
again
Mirkwood
But
the
Ring
was
lost
fell
into
the
Great
River
Anduin
and
vanished
For
Isildur
was
marching
north
along
the
east
banks
the
River
and
near
the
Gladden
Fields
was
waylaid
the
Ores
the
Mountains
and
almost
all
his
folk
were
slain
leaped
into
the
waters
but
the
Ring
slipped
from
his
finger
swam
and
then
the
Ores
saw
him
and
killed
him
with
arrows
Gandalf
paused
And
there
the
dark
pools
amid
the
Gladden
Fields
said
the
Ring
passed
out
knowledge
and
legend
and
even
much
its
history
known
now
only
few
and
the
Council
the
Wise
could
discover
more
But
last
can
carry
the
story
think
Long
after
but
still
very
long
ago

they

the

they

was
interested
roots
and
beginnings
dived
into
deep
pools
burrowed
under
trees
and
growing
plants
tunnelled
into
green
mounds
and
ceased
look
the
hill
tops
the
leaves
trees
the
flowers
opening
the
air
his
head
and
his
eyes
were
downward
had
friend
called
Deagol
similar
sort
sharper
eyed
but
not
quick
and
strong
time
they
took
boat
and
went
down
the
Gladden
Fields
where
there
were
great
beds
iris
and
flowering
reeds
There
Smeagol
got
out
and
went
nosing
about
the
banks
but
Deagol
sat
the
boat
and
fished
Suddenly
great
fish
took
his
hook
and
before
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
knew
where
was
was
dragged
out
and
down
into
the
water
the
bottom
Then
let
his
line
for
thought
saw
something
shining
the
river
bed
and
holding
his
breath
grabbed
Then
came
spluttering
with
weeds
his
hair
and
handful
mud
and
swam
the
bank
And
behold
when
washed
the
mud
away
there
his
hand
lay
beauti
ful
golden
ring
and
shone
and
glittered
the
sun
that
his
heart
was
glad
But
Smeagol
had
been
watching
him
from
behind
tree
and
Deagol
gloated
over
the
ring
Smeagol
came
softly
behind
Give
that
Deagol
love
said
Smeagol
over
his
friend
shoulder
Why
said
Deagol
Because
birthday
love
and
wants
said
Smeagol
don
care
said
Deagol
have
given
you
present
already
more
than
could
afford
found
this
and
going
keep
are
you
indeed
love
said
Smeagol
and
caught
Deagol
the
throat
and
strangled
him
because
the
gold
looked
bright
and
beautiful
Then
put
the
ring
his
finger
one
ever
found
out
what
had
become
Deagol
was
murdered
far
from
home
and
his
body
was
cunningly
hidden
But
Smeagol
returned
alone
and
found
that
none
his
family
could
see
him
when
was
wearing
the
ring
was
very
pleased
with
his
discovery
and
concealed
and
used
find
out
secrets
and
put
his
knowledge
crooked
and
malicious
uses
became
sharp
eyed
and
keen
eared
for
all
that
was
hurtful
The
ring
had
given
him
power
according
his
stature
not
wondered
that
became
very
unpopular
and
was
shunned
when
vis
ible
all
his
relations
They
kicked
him
and
bit
their
feet
took
thieving
and
going
about
muttering
him
self
and
gurgling
his
throat
they
called
him
Golhim
and
cursed
him
and
told
him
far
away
and
his
grand
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
mother
desiring
peace
expelled
him
from
the
family
and
turned
him
out
her
hole
wandered
loneliness
weeping
little
for
the
hard
ness
the
world
and
journeyed
the
River
till
came
stream
that
flowed
down
from
the
mountains
and
went
that
way
caught
fish
deep
pools
with
invisible
fingers
and
ate
them
raw
One
day
was
very
hot
and
was
bending
over
pool
felt
burning
the
back
his
head
and
dazzling
light
from
the
water
pained
his
wet
eyes
wondered
for
had
almost
forgotten
about
the
Sun
Then
for
the
last
time
looked
and
shook
his
fist
her
But
lowered
his
eyes
saw
far
ahead
the
tops
the
Misty
Mountains
out
which
the
stream
came
And
thought
suddenly
would
cool
and
shady
under
those
mountains
The
Sun
could
not
watch
there
The
roots
those
mountains
must
roots
indeed
there
must
great
secrets
buried
there
which
have
not
been
discovered
since
the
beginning
journeyed
night
into
the
highlands
and
found
little
cave
out
which
the
dark
stream
ran
and
wormed
his
way
like
maggot
into
the
heart
the
hills
and
vanished
out
all
knowledge
The
Ring
went
into
the
shadows
with
him
and
even
the
maker
when
his
power
had
begun
grow
again
could
learn
nothing
Gollum
cried
Frodo
Gollum
you
mean
that
this
the
very
Gollum
creature
that
Bilbo
met
How
loathsome
think
sad
story
said
the
wizard
and
might
have
happened
others
even
some
hobbits
that
have
known
can
believe
that
Gollum
was
connected
with
hobbits
however
distantly
said
Frodo
with
some
heat
What
abominable
notion
true
all
the
same
replied
Gandalf
About
their
origins
any
rate
know
more
than
hobbits
themselves
And
even
Bilbo
story
suggests
the
kinship
There
was
great
deal
the
background
their
minds
and
memories
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
that
was
very
similar
They
understood
one
another
remark
ably
well
very
much
better
than
hobbit
would
understand
say
Dwarf
Ore
even
Elf
Think
the
riddles
they
both
knew
for
one
thing
Yes
said
Frodo
Though
other
folks
besides
hobbits
ask
riddles
and
much
the
same
sort
And
hobbits
don
cheat
Gollum
meant
cheat
all
the
time
was
just
trying
put
poor
Bilbo
off
his
guard
And
daresay
amused
his
wickedness
start
game
which
might
end
providing
him
with
easy
victim
but
lost
would
not
hurt
him
Only
too
true
fear
said
Gandalf
But
there
was
some
thing
else
think
which
you
don
see
yet
Even
Gollum
was
not
wholly
ruined
had
proved
tougher
than
even
one
the
Wise
would
have
guessed
hobbit
might
There
was
little
corner
his
mind
that
was
still
his
own
and
light
came
through
through
chink
the
dark
light
out
the
past
was
actually
pleasant
think
hear
kindly
voice
again
bringing
memories
wind
and
trees
and
sun
the
grass
and
such
forgotten
things
But
that
course
would
only
make
the
evil
part
him
angrier
the
end
unless
could
conquered
Unless
could
cured
Gandalf
sighed
Alas
there
little
hope
that
for
him
Yet
not
hope
not
though
possessed
the
Ring
long
almost
far
back
can
remember
For
was
long
since
had
worn
much
the
black
darkness
was
seldom
needed
Certainly
had
never
faded
thin
and
tough
still
But
the
thing
was
eating
his
mind
course
and
the
torment
had
become
almost
unbearable
All
the
great
secrets
under
the
mountains
had
turned
out
just
empty
night
there
was
nothing
more
find
out
nothing
worth
doing
only
nasty
furtive
eating
and
resentful
remembering
was
altogether
wretched
hated
the
dark
and
hated
light
more
hated
everything
and
the
Ring
most
all
What
you
mean
said
Frodo
Surely
the
Ring
was
his
Precious
and
the
only
thing
cared
for
But
hated
why
didn
get
rid
away
and
leave
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
You
ought
begin
understand
Frodo
after
all
you
have
heard
said
Gandalf
hated
and
loved
hated
and
loved
himself
could
not
get
rid
had
will
left
the
matter
Ring
Power
looks
after
itself
Frodo
may
slip
off
treacherously
but
its
keeper
never
abandons
most
plays
with
the
idea
handing
someone
else
care
and
that
only
early
stage
when
first
begins
grip
But
far
know
Bilbo
alone
history
has
ever
gone
beyond
playing
and
really
done
needed
all
help
too
And
even
would
never
have
just
forsaken
cast
aside
was
not
Gollum
Frodo
but
the
Ring
itself
that
decided
things
The
Ring
left
him
What
just
time
meet
Bilbo
said
Frodo
Wouldn
Ore
have
suited
better
laughing
matter
said
Gandalf
Not
for
you
was
the
strangest
event
the
whole
history
the
Ring
far
Bilbo
arrival
just
that
time
and
putting
his
hand
blindly
the
dark
There
was
more
than
one
power
work
Frodo
The
Ring
was
trying
get
back
its
master
had
slipped
from
Isildur
hand
and
betrayed
him
then
when
chance
came
caught
poor
Deagol
and
was
murdered
and
after
that
Gollum
and
had
devoured
him
could
make
further
use
him
was
too
small
and
mean
and
long
stayed
with
him
would
never
leave
his
deep
pool
again
now
when
its
master
was
awake
once
more
and
sending
out
his
dark
thought
from
Mirkwood
abandoned
Gollum
Only
picked
the
most
unlikely
person
imaginable
Bilbo
from
the
Shire
Behind
that
there
was
something
else
work
beyond
any
design
the
Ring
maker
can
put
plainer
than
saying
that
Bilbo
was
meant
find
the
Ring
and
not
its
maker
which
case
you
also
were
meant
have
And
that
may
encouraging
thought
not
said
Frodo
Though
not
sure
that
under
stand
you
But
how
have
you
learned
all
this
about
the
Ring
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
and
about
Gollum
you
really
know
all
are
you
just
guessing
still
Gandalf
looked
Frodo
and
his
eyes
glinted
knew
much
and
have
learned
much
answered
But
not
going
give
account
all
doings
you
The
history
Elendil
and
Isildur
and
the
One
Ring
known
all
the
Wise
Your
ring
shown
that
One
Ring
the
fire
writing
alone
apart
from
any
other
evidence
And
when
did
you
discover
that
asked
Frodo
inter
rupting
Just
now
this
room
course
answered
the
wizard
sharply
But
expected
find
have
come
back
from
dark
journeys
and
long
search
make
that
final
test
the
last
proof
and
all
now
only
too
clear
Making
out
Gollum
part
and
fitting
into
the
gap
the
history
required
some
thought
may
have
started
with
guesses
about
Gollum
but
not
guessing
now
know
have
seen
him
You
have
seen
Gollum
exclaimed
Frodo
amazement
Yes
The
obvious
thing
course
one
could
tried
long
ago
but
have
managed
last
Then
what
happened
after
Bilbo
escaped
from
him
you
know
that
Not
clearly
What
have
told
you
what
Gollum
was
willing
tell
though
not
course
the
way
have
reported
Gollum
liar
and
you
have
sift
his
words
For
instance
called
the
Ring
his
birthday
present
and
stuck
that
said
came
from
his
grandmother
who
had
lots
beautiful
things
that
kind
ridiculous
story
have
doubt
that
Smeagol
grandmother
was
matriarch
great
person
her
way
but
talk
her
possessing
many
Elven
rings
was
absurd
and
for
giving
them
away
was
lie
But
lie
with
grain
truth
The
murder
Deagol
haunted
Gollum
and
had
made
defence
repeating
his
Precious
over
and
over
again
gnawed
bones
the
dark
until
almost
believed
was
his
birthday
Deagol
ought
have
given
the
ring
him
had
obviously
turned
just
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
present
was
his
birthday
present
and
and
endured
him
long
could
but
the
truth
was
desper
ately
important
and
the
end
had
harsh
put
the
fear
fire
him
and
wrung
the
true
story
out
him
bit
bit
together
with
much
snivelling
and
snarling
thought
was
misunderstood
and
ill
used
But
when
had
last
told
his
history
far
the
end
the
Riddle
game
and
Bilbo
escape
would
not
say
any
more
except
dark
hints
Some
other
fear
was
him
greater
than
mine
muttered
that
was
going
get
his
own
back
People
would
see
would
stand
being
kicked
and
driven
into
hole
and
then
robbed
Gollum
had
good
friends
now
good
friends
and
very
strong
They
would
help
him
Baggins
would
pay
for
That
was
his
chief
thought
hated
Bilbo
and
cursed
his
name
What
more
knew
where
came
from
But
how
did
find
that
out
asked
Frodo
Well
for
the
name
Bilbo
very
foolishly
told
Gollum
himself
and
after
that
would
not
difficult
discover
his
country
once
Gollum
came
out
yes
came
out
His
longing
for
the
Ring
proved
stronger
than
his
fear
the
Ores
even
the
light
After
year
two
left
the
mountains
You
see
though
still
bound
desire
the
Ring
was
longer
devouring
him
began
revive
little
felt
old
terribly
old
yet
less
timid
and
was
mortally
hungry
Light
light
Sun
and
Moon
still
feared
and
hated
and
always
will
think
but
was
cunning
found
could
hide
from
daylight
and
moonshine
and
make
his
way
swiftly
and
softly
dead
night
with
his
pale
cold
eyes
and
catch
small
frightened
unwary
things
grew
stronger
and
bolder
with
new
food
and
new
air
found
his
way
into
Mirkwood
one
would
expect
that
where
you
found
him
asked
Frodo
saw
him
there
answered
Gandalf
but
before
that
had
wandered
far
following
Bilbo
trail
was
difficult
learn
anything
from
him
for
certain
for
his
talk
was
con
stantly
interrupted
curses
and
threats
What
had
got
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
its
pocketses
said
wouldn
say
precious
Little
cheat
Not
fair
question
cheated
first
did
broke
the
rules
ought
have
squeezed
yes
precious
And
will
precious
That
sample
his
talk
don
suppose
you
want
any
more
had
weary
days
But
from
hints
dropped
among
the
snarls
gathered
that
his
padding
feet
had
taken
him
last
Esgaroth
and
even
the
streets
Dale
listening
secretly
and
peering
Well
the
news
the
great
events
went
far
and
wide
Wilderland
and
many
had
heard
Bilbo
name
and
knew
where
came
from
had
made
secret
our
return
journey
his
home
the
West
Gollum
sharp
ears
would
soon
learn
what
wanted
Then
why
didn
track
Bilbo
further
asked
Frodo
Why
didn
come
the
Shire
said
Gandalf
now
come
think
Gollum
tried
set
out
and
came
back
westward
far
the
Great
River
But
then
turned
aside
was
not
daunted
the
distance
sure
something
else
drew
him
away
friends
think
those
that
hunted
him
for
The
Wood
elves
tracked
him
first
easy
task
for
them
for
his
trail
was
still
fresh
then
Through
Mirkwood
and
back
again
led
them
though
they
never
caught
him
The
wood
was
full
the
rumour
him
dreadful
tales
even
among
beasts
and
birds
The
Woodmen
said
that
there
was
some
new
terror
abroad
ghost
that
drank
blood
climbed
trees
find
nests
crept
into
holes
find
the
young
slipped
through
windows
find
cradles
But
the
western
edge
Mirkwood
the
trail
turned
away
wandered
off
southwards
and
passed
out
the
Wood
elves
ken
and
was
lost
And
then
made
great
mistake
Yes
Frodo
and
not
the
first
though
fear
may
prove
the
worst
let
the
matter
let
him
for
had
much
else
think
that
time
and
still
trusted
the
lore
Saruman
Well
that
was
years
ago
have
paid
for
since
with
many
dark
and
dangerous
days
The
trail
was
long
cold
when
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
took
again
after
Bilbo
left
here
And
search
would
have
been
vain
but
for
the
help
that
had
from
friend
Aragorn
the
greatest
traveller
and
huntsman
this
age
the
world
Together
sought
for
Gollum
down
the
whole
length
Wilderland
without
hope
and
without
success
But
last
when
had
given
the
chase
and
turned
other
paths
Gollum
was
found
friend
returned
out
great
perils
bringing
the
miserable
creature
with
him
What
had
been
doing
would
not
say
only
wept
and
called
cruel
with
many
gollum
his
throat
and
when
pressed
him
whined
and
cringed
and
rubbed
his
long
hands
licking
his
fingers
they
pained
him
remembered
some
old
torture
But
afraid
there
possible
doubt
had
made
his
slow
sneaking
way
step
step
mile
mile
south
down
last
the
Land
Mordor
heavy
silence
fell
the
room
Frodo
could
hear
his
heart
beating
Even
outside
everything
seemed
still
sound
Sam
shears
could
now
heard
Yes
Mordor
said
Gandalf
Alas
Mordor
draws
all
wicked
things
and
the
Dark
Power
was
bending
all
its
will
gather
them
there
The
Ring
the
Enemy
would
leave
its
mark
too
leave
him
open
the
summons
And
all
folk
were
whispering
then
the
new
Shadow
the
South
and
its
hatred
the
West
There
were
his
fine
new
friends
who
would
help
him
his
revenge
Wretched
fool
that
land
would
learn
much
too
much
for
his
comfort
And
sooner
later
lurked
and
pried
the
borders
would
caught
and
taken
for
examination
That
was
the
way
fear
When
was
found
had
already
been
there
long
and
was
his
way
back
some
errand
mischief
But
that
does
not
matter
much
now
His
worst
mischief
was
done
Yes
alas
through
him
the
Enemy
has
learned
that
the
One
has
been
found
again
knows
where
Isildur
fell
knows
where
Gollum
found
his
ring
knows
that
Great
Ring
for
gave
long
life
knows
that
not
one
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
the
Three
for
they
have
never
been
lost
and
they
endure
evil
knows
that
not
one
the
Seven
the
Nine
for
they
are
accounted
for
knows
that
the
One
And
has
last
heard
think
hobbits
and
the
Shire
The
Shire
may
seeking
for
now
has
not
already
found
out
where
lies
Indeed
Frodo
fear
that
may
even
think
that
the
long
unnoticed
name
Baggins
has
become
important
But
this
terrible
cried
Frodo
Far
worse
than
the
worst
that
imagined
from
your
hints
and
warnings
Gandalf
best
friends
what
For
now
really
afraid
What
What
pity
that
Bilbo
did
not
stab
that
vile
creature
when
had
chance
Pity
was
Pity
that
stayed
his
hand
Pity
and
Mercy
not
strike
without
need
And
has
been
well
rewarded
Frodo
sure
that
took
little
hurt
from
the
evil
and
escaped
the
end
because
began
his
ownership
the
Ring
With
Pity
sorry
said
Frodo
But
frightened
and
not
feel
any
pity
for
Gollum
You
have
not
seen
him
Gandalf
broke
and
don
want
said
Frodo
can
understand
you
you
mean
say
that
you
and
the
Elves
have
let
him
live
after
all
those
horrible
deeds
Now
any
rate
bad
Ore
and
just
enemy
deserves
death
Deserves
daresay
does
Many
that
live
deserve
death
And
some
that
die
deserve
life
Can
you
give
them
Then
not
too
eager
deal
out
death
judge
ment
For
even
the
very
wise
cannot
see
all
ends
have
not
much
hope
that
Gollum
can
cured
before
dies
but
there
chance
And
bound
with
the
fate
the
Ring
heart
tells
that
has
some
part
play
yet
for
good
ill
before
the
end
and
when
that
comes
the
pity
Bilbo
may
rule
the
fate
many
yours
not
least
any
case
did
not
lull
him
very
old
and
very
wretched
The
Wood
elves
have
him
prison
but
they
treat
him
with
such
kindness
they
can
find
their
wise
hearts
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
All
the
same
said
Frodo
even
Bilbo
could
not
kill
Gollum
wish
had
not
kept
the
Ring
wish
had
never
found
and
that
had
not
got
Why
did
you
let
keep
Why
didn
you
make
throw
away
destroy
Let
you
Make
you
said
the
wizard
Haven
you
been
listening
all
that
have
said
You
are
not
thinking
what
you
are
saying
But
for
throwing
away
that
was
obviously
wrong
These
Rings
have
way
being
found
evil
hands
might
have
done
great
evil
Worst
all
might
have
fallen
into
the
hands
the
Enemy
Indeed
certainly
would
for
this
the
One
and
exerting
all
his
power
find
draw
himself
course
dear
Frodo
was
dangerous
for
you
and
that
has
troubled
deeply
But
there
was
much
stake
that
had
take
some
risk
though
even
when
was
far
away
there
has
never
been
day
when
the
Shire
has
not
been
guarded
watchful
eyes
long
you
never
used
did
not
think
that
the
Ring
would
have
any
lasting
effect
you
not
for
evil
not
any
rate
for
very
long
time
And
you
must
remember
that
nine
years
ago
when
last
saw
you
still
knew
little
for
certain
But
why
not
destroy
you
say
should
have
been
done
long
ago
cried
Frodo
again
you
had
warned
even
sent
message
would
have
done
away
with
Would
you
How
would
you
that
Have
you
ever
tried
But
suppose
one
could
hammer
melt
Try
said
Gandalf
Try
now
Frodo
drew
the
Ring
out
his
pocket
again
and
looked
now
appeared
plain
and
smooth
without
mark
device
that
could
see
The
gold
looked
very
fair
and
pure
and
Frodo
thought
how
rich
and
beautiful
was
its
colour
how
perfect
was
its
roundness
was
admirable
thing
and
altogether
precious
When
took
out
had
intended
fling
from
him
into
the
very
hottest
part
the
fire
But
found
now
that
could
not
not
without
great
struggle
weighed
the
Ring
his
hand
hesitating
and
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
forcing
himself
remember
all
that
Gandalf
had
told
him
and
then
with
effort
will
made
movement
cast
away
but
found
that
had
put
back
his
pocket
Gandalf
laughed
grimly
You
see
Already
you
too
Frodo
cannot
easily
let
nor
will
damage
And
could
not
make
you
except
force
which
would
break
your
mind
But
for
breaking
the
Ring
force
useless
Even
you
took
and
struck
with
heavy
sledge
hammer
would
make
dint
cannot
unmade
your
hands
mine
Your
small
fire
course
would
not
melt
even
ordinary
gold
This
Ring
has
already
passed
through
unscathed
and
even
unheated
But
there
smith
forge
this
Shire
that
could
change
all
Not
even
the
anvils
and
furnaces
the
Dwarves
could
that
has
been
said
that
dragon
fire
could
melt
and
consume
the
Rings
Power
but
there
not
now
any
dragon
left
earth
which
the
old
fire
hot
enough
nor
was
there
ever
any
dragon
not
even
Ancalagon
the
Black
who
could
have
harmed
the
One
Ring
the
Ruling
Ring
for
that
was
made
Sauron
himself
There
only
one
way
find
the
Cracks
Doom
the
depths
Orodruin
the
Fire
mountain
and
cast
the
Ring
there
you
really
wish
destroy
put
beyond
the
grasp
the
Enemy
for
ever
really
wish
destroy
cried
Frodo
well
have
destroyed
not
made
for
perilous
quests
wish
had
never
seen
the
Ring
Why
did
come
Why
was
chosen
Such
questions
cannot
answered
said
Gandalf
You
may
sure
that
was
not
for
any
merit
that
others
not
possess
not
for
power
wisdom
any
rate
But
you
have
been
chosen
and
you
must
therefore
use
such
strength
and
heart
and
wits
you
have
But
have
little
any
these
things
You
are
wise
and
powerful
Will
you
not
take
the
Ring
cried
Gandalf
springing
his
feet
With
that
power
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
should
have
power
too
great
and
terrible
And
over
the
Ring
would
gain
power
still
greater
and
more
deadly
His
eyes
flashed
and
his
face
was
lit
fire
within
not
tempt
For
not
wish
become
like
the
Dark
Lord
himself
Yet
the
way
the
Ring
heart
pity
pity
for
weakness
and
the
desire
strength
good
not
tempt
dare
not
take
not
even
keep
safe
unused
The
wish
wield
would
too
great
for
strength
shall
have
such
need
Great
perils
lie
before
went
the
window
and
drew
aside
the
curtains
and
the
shutters
Sunlight
streamed
back
again
into
the
room
Sam
passed
along
the
path
outside
whistling
And
now
said
the
wizard
turning
back
Frodo
the
decision
lies
with
you
But
will
always
help
you
laid
his
hand
Frodo
shoulder
will
help
you
bear
this
burden
long
yours
bear
But
must
something
soon
The
Enemy
moving
There
was
long
silence
Gandalf
sat
down
again
and
puffed
his
pipe
lost
thought
His
eyes
seemed
closed
but
under
the
lids
was
watching
Frodo
intently
Frodo
gazed
fixedly
the
red
embers
the
hearth
until
they
filled
all
his
vision
and
seemed
looking
down
into
profound
wells
fire
was
thinking
the
fabled
Cracks
Doom
and
the
terror
the
Fiery
Mountain
Well
said
Gandalf
last
What
are
you
thinking
about
Have
you
decided
what
answered
Frodo
coming
back
himself
out
dark
ness
and
finding
his
surprise
that
was
not
dark
and
that
out
the
window
could
see
the
sunlit
garden
perhaps
yes
far
understand
what
you
have
said
suppose
must
keep
the
Ring
and
guard
least
for
the
present
whatever
may
Whatever
may
will
slow
slow
evil
you
keep
with
that
purpose
said
Gandalf
hope
said
Frodo
But
hope
that
you
may
find
some
other
better
keeper
soon
But
the
meanwhile
seems
that
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
danger
danger
all
that
live
near
cannot
keep
the
Ring
and
stay
here
ought
leave
Bag
End
leave
the
Shire
leave
everything
and
away
sighed
should
like
save
the
Shire
could
though
there
have
been
times
when
thought
the
inhabitants
too
stupid
and
dull
for
words
and
have
felt
that
earthquake
invasion
dragons
might
good
for
them
But
don
feel
like
that
now
feel
that
long
the
Shire
lies
behind
safe
and
comfortable
shall
find
wandering
more
bearable
shall
know
that
somewhere
there
firm
foothold
even
feet
cannot
stand
there
again
course
have
sometimes
thought
going
away
but
imagined
that
kind
holiday
series
adventures
like
Bilbo
better
ending
peace
But
this
would
mean
exile
flight
from
danger
into
danger
drawing
after
And
suppose
must
alone
that
and
save
the
Shire
But
feel
very
small
and
very
uprooted
and
well
desperate
The
Enemy
strong
and
terrible
did
not
tell
Gandalf
but
was
speaking
great
desire
follow
Bilbo
flamed
his
heart
follow
Bilbo
and
even
perhaps
find
him
again
was
strong
that
overcame
his
fear
could
almost
have
run
out
there
and
then
down
the
road
without
his
hat
Bilbo
had
done
similar
morning
long
ago
dear
Frodo
exclaimed
Gandalf
Hobbits
really
are
amazing
creatures
have
said
before
You
can
learn
all
that
there
know
about
their
ways
month
and
yet
after
hundred
years
they
can
still
surprise
you
pinch
hardly
expected
get
such
answer
not
even
from
you
But
Bilbo
made
mistake
choosing
his
heir
though
little
thought
how
important
would
prove
afraid
you
are
right
The
Ring
will
not
able
stay
hidden
the
Shire
much
longer
and
for
your
own
sake
well
for
others
you
will
have
and
leave
the
name
Baggins
behind
you
That
name
will
not
safe
have
outside
the
Shire
the
Wild
will
give
you
travelling
name
now
When
you
Underhill
THE
SHADOW
THE
PAST
But
don
think
you
need
alone
Not
you
know
anyone
you
can
trust
and
who
would
willing
your
side
and
that
you
would
willing
take
into
unknown
perils
But
you
look
for
companion
careful
choosing
And
careful
what
you
say
even
your
closest
friends
The
enemy
has
many
spies
and
many
ways
hearing
Suddenly
stopped
listening
Frodo
became
aware
that
all
was
very
quiet
inside
and
outside
Gandalf
crept
one
side
the
window
Then
with
dart
sprang
the
sill
and
thrust
long
arm
out
and
downwards
There
was
squawk
and
came
Sam
Gamgee
curly
head
hauled
one
ear
Well
well
bless
beard
said
Gandalf
Sam
Gamgee
Now
what
may
you
doing
Lor
bless
you
Gandalf
sir
said
Sam
Nothing
Leastways
was
just
trimming
the
grass
border
under
the
window
you
follow
picked
his
shears
and
exhibited
them
evidence
don
said
Gandalf
grimly
some
time
since
last
heard
the
sound
your
shears
How
long
have
you
been
eavesdropping
Eavesdropping
sir
don
follow
you
begging
your
pardon
There
ain
eaves
Bag
End
and
that
fact
Don
fool
What
have
you
heard
and
why
did
you
listen
Gandalf
eyes
flashed
and
his
brows
stuck
out
like
bristles
Frodo
sir
cried
Sam
quaking
Don
let
him
hurt
sir
Don
let
him
turn
into
anything
unnatural
old
dad
would
take
meant
harm
honour
sir
won
hurt
you
said
Frodo
hardly
able
keep
from
laughing
although
was
himself
startled
and
rather
puzzled
knows
well
that
you
mean
harm
But
just
you
and
answer
his
questions
straight
away
Well
sir
said
Sam
dithering
little
heard
deal
that
didn
rightly
understand
about
enemy
and
rings
and
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Bilbo
sir
and
dragons
and
fiery
mountain
and
and
Elves
sir
listened
because
couldn
help
myself
you
know
what
mean
Lor
bless
sir
but
love
tales
that
sort
And
believe
them
too
whatever
Ted
may
say
Elves
sir
would
dearly
love
see
them
Couldn
you
take
see
Elves
sir
when
you
Suddenly
Gandalf
laughed
Come
inside
shouted
and
putting
out
both
his
arms
lifted
the
astonished
Sam
shears
grass
clippings
and
all
right
through
the
window
and
stood
him
the
floor
Take
you
see
Elves
said
eyeing
Sam
closely
but
with
smile
flickering
his
face
you
heard
that
Frodo
going
away
did
sir
And
that
why
choked
which
you
heard
seemingly
tried
not
sir
but
burst
out
was
upset
can
helped
Sam
said
Frodo
sadly
had
sud
denly
realized
that
flying
from
the
Shire
would
mean
more
painful
partings
than
merely
saying
farewell
the
familiar
comforts
Bag
End
shall
have
But
and
here
looked
hard
Sam
you
really
care
about
you
will
keep
that
dead
secret
See
you
don
you
even
breathe
word
what
you
heard
here
then
hope
Gandalf
will
turn
you
into
spotted
toad
and
fill
the
garden
full
grass
snakes
Sam
fell
his
knees
trembling
Get
Sam
said
Gandalf
have
thought
something
better
than
that
Some
thing
shut
your
mouth
and
punish
you
properly
for
listen
ing
You
shall
away
with
Frodo
sir
cried
Sam
springing
like
dog
invited
for
walk
and
see
Elves
and
all
Hooray
shouted
and
then
burst
into
tears
Chapter
THREE
COMPANY
You
ought
quietly
and
you
ought
soon
said
Gandalf
Two
three
weeks
had
passed
and
still
Frodo
made
sign
getting
ready
know
But
difficult
both
objected
just
vanish
like
Bilbo
the
tale
will
all
over
the
Shire
time
course
you
mustn
vanish
said
Gandalf
That
wouldn
all
said
soon
not
instantly
you
can
think
any
way
slipping
out
the
Shire
without
its
being
generally
known
will
worth
little
delay
But
you
must
not
delay
too
long
What
about
the
autumn
after
Our
Birthday
asked
Frodo
think
could
probably
make
some
arrangements
then
tell
the
truth
was
very
reluctant
start
now
that
had
come
the
point
Bag
End
seemed
more
desirable
residence
than
had
for
years
and
wanted
savour
much
could
his
last
summer
the
Shire
When
autumn
came
knew
that
part
least
his
heart
would
think
more
kindly
journeying
always
did
that
season
had
indeed
privately
made
his
mind
leave
his
fiftieth
birthday
Bilbo
one
hundred
and
twenty
eighth
seemed
somehow
the
proper
day
which
set
out
and
follow
him
Following
Bilbo
was
uppermost
his
mind
and
the
one
thing
that
made
the
thought
leaving
bearable
thought
little
possible
about
the
Ring
and
where
might
lead
him
the
end
But
did
not
tell
all
his
thoughts
Gandalf
What
the
wizard
guessed
was
always
difficult
tell
looked
Frodo
and
smiled
Very
well
said
think
that
will
but
must
not
any
later
getting
very
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
anxious
the
meanwhile
take
care
and
don
let
out
any
hint
where
you
are
going
And
see
that
Sam
Gamgee
does
not
talk
does
really
shall
turn
him
into
toad
for
where
going
said
Frodo
would
difficult
give
that
away
for
have
clear
idea
myself
yet
Don
absurd
said
Gandalf
not
warning
you
against
leaving
address
the
post
office
But
you
are
leaving
the
Shire
and
that
should
not
known
until
you
are
far
away
And
you
must
least
set
out
either
North
South
West
East
and
the
direction
should
cer
tainly
not

have
been
taken
with
the
thoughts
leaving
Bag
End
and
saying
farewell
that
have
never
even
considered
the
direction
said
Frodo
For
where
And
what
shall
steer
What
quest
Bilbo
went
find
treasure
there
and
back
again
but
lose
one
and
not
return
far
can
see
But
you
cannot
see
very
far
said
Gandalf
Neither
can
may
your
task
find
the
Cracks
Doom
but
that
quest
may
for
others
not
know
any
rate
you
are
not
ready
for
that
long
road
yet
indeed
said
Frodo
But
the
meantime
what
course
take
Towards
danger
but
not
too
rashly
nor
too
straight
answered
the
wizard
you
want
advice
make
for
Rivendell
That
journey
should
not
prove
too
perilous
though
the
Road
less
easy
than
was
and
will
grow
worse
the
year
fails
Rivendell
said
Frodo
Very
good
will
east
and
will
make
for
Rivendell
will
take
Sam
visit
the
Elves
will
delighted
spoke
lightly
but
his
heart
was
moved
suddenly
with
desire
see
the
house
Elrond
Halfelven
and
breathe
the
air
that
deep
valley
where
many
the
Fair
Folk
still
dwelt
peace
One
summer
evening
astonishing
piece

portents
the
borders
the
Shire
were
forgotten
for
more
important
matters
Frodo
was
selling
Bag
End
indeed
had
already
sold
the
Sackville
Bagginses
For
nice
bit
too
said
some
bargain
price
said
others
and
that
more
likely
when
Mistress
Lobelia
the
buyer
Otho
had
died
some
years
before
the
ripe
but
disappointed
age
102
Just
why
Frodo
was
selling
his
beautiful
hole
was
even
more
debatable
than
the
price
few
held
the
theory
sup
ported
the
nods
and

But
firmly
fixed

the

this
hard

harder
than
any

Gandalf
Though
kept
himself
very
quiet
and
did
not
about

was
well
known
that
was
hiding
the
Bag
End
But
however
removal
might
fit
with
the
designs

wizardry
there
was
doubt
about
the
fact
Frodo
Baggins
was
going
back
Buckland
Yes

autumn
said
Merry

looking
out
for
nice
little
hole
for
perhaps
small
house
matter
fact
with
Merry
help
had
already
chosen
and
bought
little
house
Crickhollow
the
country
beyond
Bucklebury
all
but
Sam
pretended
was
going
settle
down
there
permanently
The
decision
set
out
eastwards
had
suggested
the
idea
him
for
Buckland
was
the
eastern
borders
the
Shire
and
had
lived
there
childhood
his
going
back
would
least
seem
credible
Gandalf
stayed
the
Shire
for
over
two
months
Then
one
evening
the
end
June
soon
after
Frodo
plan
had
been
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
finally
arranged
suddenly
announced
that
was
going
off
again
next
morning
Only
for
short
while
hope
said
But
going
down
beyond
the
southern
borders
get
some
news
can
have
been
idle
longer
than
should
spoke
lightly
but
seemed
Frodo
that
looked
rather
worried
Has
anything
happened
asked
Well
but
have
heard
something
that
has
made
anxious
and
needs
looking
into
think
necessary
after
all
for
you
get
off
once
shall
come
back
immediately
least
send
word
the
meanwhile
stick
your
plan
but
more
careful
than
ever
especially
the
Ring
Let
impress
you
once
more
don
use
went
off
dawn
may
back
any
day
said
the
very
latest
shall
come
back
for
the
farewell
party
think
after
all
you
may
need
company
the
Road
first
Frodo
was
good
deal
disturbed
and
wondered
often
what
Gandalf
could
have
heard
but
his
uneasiness
wore
off
and
the
fine
weather
forgot
his
troubles
for
while
The
Shire
had
seldom
seen
fair
summer
rich
autumn
the
trees
were
laden
with
apples
honey
was
dripping
the
combs
and
the
corn
was
tall
and
full
Autumn
was
well
under
way
before
Frodo
began
worry
about
Gandalf
again
September
was
passing
and
there
was
still
news
him
The
Birthday
and
the
removal
drew
nearer
and
still
did
not
come
send
word
Bag
End
began
busy
Some
Frodo
friends
came
stay
and
help
him
with
the
packing
there
was
Fredegar
Bolger
and
Folco
Boffin
and
course
his
special
friends
Pippin
Took
and
Merry
Brandybuck
Between
them
they
turned
the
whole
place
upside
down
September
20th
two
covered
carts
went
off
laden
Buckland
conveying
the
furniture
and
goods
that
Frodo
had
not
sold
his
new
home
way
the
Brandywine
Bridge
The
next
day
Frodo
became
really
anxious
and
kept
constant
look
out
for
Gandalf
Thursday
his
birthday
morning
dawned
fair
and
clear
had
long
ago
for
Bilbo
great
party
Still
Gandalf
did
not
appear
the
THREE
COMPANY
evening
Frodo
gave
his
farewell
feast
was
quite
small
just
dinner
for
himself
and
his
four
helpers
but
was
troubled
and
felt
mood
for
The
thought
that
would
soon
have
part
with
his
young
friends
weighed
his
heart
wondered
how
would
break
them
The
four
younger
hobbits
were
however
high
spirits
and
the
party
soon
became
very
cheerful
spite
Gandalf
absence
The
dining
room
was
bare
except
for
table
and
chairs
but
the
food
was
good
and
there
was
good
wine
Frodo
wine
had
not
been
included
the
sale
the
Sackville
Bagginses
Whatever
happens
the
rest
stuff
when
the
get
their
claws
any
rate
have
found
good
home
for
this
said
Frodo
drained
his
glass
was
the
last
drop
Old
Winyards
When
they
had
sung
many
songs
and
talked
many
things
they
had
done
together
they
toasted
Bilbo
birthday
and
they
drank
his
health
and
Frodo
together
according
Frodo
custom
Then
they
went
out
for
sniff
air
and
glimpse
the
stars
and
then
they
went
bed
Frodo
party
was
over
and
Gandalf
had
not
come
The
next
morning
they
were
busy
packing
another
cart
with
the
remainder
the
luggage
Merry
took
charge
this
and
drove
off
with
Fatty
that
Fredegar
Bolger
Someone
must
get
there
and
warm
the
house
before
you
arrive
said
Merry
Well
see
you
later
the
day
after
tomorrow
you
don
sleep
the
way
Folco
went
home
after
lunch
but
Pippin
remained
behind
Frodo
was
restless
and
anxious
listening
vain
for
sound
Gandalf
decided
wait
until
nightfall
After
that
Gandalf
wanted
him
urgently
would
Crickhollow
and
might
even
get
there
first
For
Frodo
was
going
foot
His
plan
for
pleasure
and
last
look
the
Shire
much
any
other
reason
was
walk
from
Hobbiton
Bucklebury
Ferry
taking
fairly
easy
shall
get
myself
bit
into
training
too
said
looking
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
himself
dusty
mirror
the
half
empty
hall
had
not
done
any
strenuous
walking
for
long
time
and
the
reflection
looked
rather
flabby
thought
After
lunch
the
Sackville
Bagginses
Lobelia
and
her
sandy
haired
son
Lotho
turned
much
Frodo
annoy
ance
Ours
last
said
Lobelia
she
stepped
inside
was
not
polite
nor
strictly
true
for
the
sale
Bag
End
did
not
take
effect
until
midnight
But
Lobelia
can
perhaps
for
given
she
had
been
obliged
wait
about
seventy
seven
years
longer
for
Bag
End
than
she
once
hoped
and
she
was
now
hundred
years
old
Anyway
she
had
come
see
that
nothing
she
had
paid
for
had
been
carried
off
and
she
wanted
the
keys
took
long
while
satisfy
her
she
had
brought
complete
inventory
with
her
and
went
right
through
the
end
she
departed
with
Lotho
and
the
spare
key
and
the
promise
that
the
other
key
would
left
the
Gamgees
Bagshot
Row
She
snorted
and
showed
plainly
that
she
thought
the
Gamgees
capable
plundering
the
hole
during
the
night
Frodo
did
not
offer
her
any
tea
took
his
own
tea
with
Pippin
and
Sam
Gamgee
the
kitchen
had
been
officially
announced
that
Sam
was
coming
Buckland
for
Frodo
and
look
after
his
bit
garden
arrangement
that
was
approved
the
Gaffer
though
did
not
console
him
for
the
prospect
having
Lobelia
neighbour
Our
last
meal
Bag
End
said
Frodo
pushing
back
his
chair
They
left
the
washing
for
Lobelia
Pippin
and
Sam
strapped
their
three
packs
and
piled
them
the
porch
Pippin
went
out
for
last
stroll
the
garden
Sam
dis
appeared
The
sun
went
down
Bag
End
seemed
sad
and
gloomy
and
dishevelled
Frodo
wandered
round
the
familiar
rooms
and
saw
the
light
the
sunset
fade
the
walls
and
shadows
creep
out
the
corners
grew
slowly
dark
indoors
went
out
and
walked
down
the
gate
the
bottom
the
path
and
then
short
way
down
the
Hill
Road
half
THREE
COMPANY
expected
see
Gandalf
come
striding
through
the
dusk
The
sky
was
clear
and
the
stars
were
growing
bright
going
fine
night
said
aloud
That
good
for
beginning
feel
like
walking
can
bear
any
more
hanging
about
going
start
and
Gandalf
must
follow
turned
back
and
then
stopped
for
heard
voices
just
round
the
corner
the
end
Bagshot
Row
One
voice
was
certainly
the
old
Gaffer
the
other
was
strange
and
some
how
unpleasant
could
not
make
out
what
said
but
heard
the
Gaffer
answers
which
were
rather
shrill
The
old
man
seemed
put
out
Baggins
has
gone
away
Went
this
morning
and
Sam
went
with
him
anyway
all
his
stuff
went
Yes
sold
out
and
gone
tell
Why
Why
none
business
yours
Where
That
ain
secret
moved
Bucklebury
some
such
place
away
down
yonder
Yes
tidy
way
never
been
far
myself
they
queer
folks
Buckland
can
give
message
Good
night
you
Footsteps
went
away
down
the
Hill
Frodo
wondered
vaguely
why
the
fact
that
they
did
not
come
the
Hill
seemed
great
relief
sick
questions
and
curiosity
about
doings
suppose
thought
What
inquisitive
lot
they
all
are
had
half
mind
and
ask
the
Gaffer
who
the
inquirer
was
but
thought
better
worse
and
turned
and
walked
quickly
back
Bag
End
Pippin
was
sitting
his
pack
the
porch
Sam
was
not
there
Frodo
stepped
inside
the
dark
door
Sam
called
Sam
Time
Coming
sir
came
the
answer
from
far
within
followed
soon
Sam
himself
wiping
his
mouth
had
been
saying
farewell
the
beer
barrel
the
cellar
All
aboard
Sam
said
Frodo
Yes
sir
last
for
bit
now
sir
Frodo
shut
and
locked
the
round
door
and
gave
the
key
Sam
Run
down
with
this
your
home
Sam
said
Then
cut
along
the
Row
and
meet
quick
you
can
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
the
gate
the
lane
beyond
the
meadows
are
not
going
through
the
village
tonight
Too
many
ears
pricking
and
eyes
prying
Sam
ran
off
full
speed
Well
now
off
last
said
Frodo
They
shouldered
their
packs
and
took
their
sticks
and
walked
round
the
corner
the
west
side
Bag
End
Good
bye
said
Frodo
looking
the
dark
blank
windows
waved
his
hand
and
then
turned
and
following
Bilbo
had
known
hurried
after
Peregrin
down
the
garden
path
They
jumped
over
the
low
place
the
hedge
the
bottom
and
took
the
fields
passing
into
the
darkness
like
rustle
the
grasses
the
bottom
the
Hill
its
western
side
they
came
the
gate
opening
narrow
lane
There
they
halted
and
adjusted
the
straps
their
packs
Presently
Sam
appeared
trotting
quickly
and
breathing
hard
his
heavy
pack
was
hoisted
high
his
shoulders
and
had
put
his
head
tall
shapeless
felt
bag
which
called
hat
the
gloom
looked
very
much
like
dwarf
sure
you
have
given
all
the
heaviest
stuff
said
Frodo
pity
snails
and
all
that
carry
their
homes
their
backs
could
take
lot
more
yet
sir
packet
quite
light
said
Sam
stoutly
and
untruthfully
you
don
Sam
said
Pippin
good
for
him
got
nothing
except
what
ordered
pack
been
slack
lately
and
feel
the
weight
less
when
walked
off
some
his
own
land
poor
old
hobbit
laughed
Frodo
shall
thin
willow
wand
sure
before
get
Buckland
But
was
talking
nonsense
suspect
you
have
taken
more
than
your
share
Sam
and
shall
look
into
our
next
packing
picked
his
stick
again
Well
all
like
walking
the
dark
said
let
put
some
miles
behind
before
bed
For
short
way
they
followed
the
lane
westwards
Then
leaving
they
turned
left
and
took
quietly
the
fields
again
THREE
COMPANY
They
went
single
file
along
hedgerows
and
the
borders
coppices
and
night
fell
dark
about
them
their
dark
cloaks
they
were
invisible
they
all
had
magic
rings
Since
they
were
all
hobbits
and
were
trying
silent
they
made
noise
that
even
hobbits
would
hear
Even
the
wild
things
the
fields
and
woods
hardly
noticed
their
passing
After
some
time
they
crossed
the
Water
west
Hobbiton
narrow
plank
bridge
The
stream
was
there
more
than
winding
black
ribbon
bordered
with
leaning
alder
trees
mile
two
further
south
they
hastily
crossed
the
great
road
from
the
Brandywine
Bridge
they
were
now
the
Tookland
and
bending
south
eastwards
they
made
for
the
Green
Hill
Country
they
began
climb
its
first
slopes
they
looked
back
and
saw
the
lamps
Hobbiton
far
off
twinkling
the
gentle
valley
the
Water
Soon
disappeared
the
folds
the
darkened
land
and
was
followed
Bywater
beside
its
grey
pool
When
the
light
the
last
farm
was
far
behind
peeping
among
the
trees
Frodo
turned
and
waved
hand
farewell
wonder
shall
ever
look
down
into
that
valley
again
said
quietly
When
they
had
walked
for
about
three
hours
they
rested
The
night
was
clear
cool
and
starry
but
smoke
like
wisps
mist
were
creeping
the
hill
sides
from
the
streams
and
deep
meadows
Thin
clad
birches
swaying
light
wind
above
their
heads
made
black
net
against
the
pale
sky
They
ate
very
frugal
supper
for
hobbits
and
then
went
again
Soon
they
struck
narrow
road
that
went
rolling
and
down
fading
grey
into
the
darkness
ahead
the
road
Woodhall
and
Stock
and
the
Bucklebury
Ferry
climbed
away
from
the
main
road
the
Water
valley
and
wound
over
the
skirts
the
Green
Hills
towards
Woody
End
wild
corner
the
Eastfarthing
After
while
they
plunged
into
deeply
cloven
track
between
tall
trees
that
rustled
their
dry
leaves
the
night
was
very
dark
first
they
talked
hummed
tune
softly
together
being
now
far
away
from
inquisitive
ears
Then
they
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
marched
silence
and
Pippin
began
lag
behind
last
they
began
climb
steep
slope
stopped
and
yawned
sleepy
said
that
soon
shall
fall
down
the
road
Are
you
going
sleep
your
legs
nearly
midnight
thought
you
liked
walking
the
dark
said
Frodo
But
there
great
hurry
Merry
expects
some
time
the
day
after
tomorrow
but
that
leaves
nearly
two
days
more
halt
the
first
likely
spot
The
wind
the
West
said
Sam
get
the
other
side
this
hill
shall
find
spot
that
sheltered
and
snug
enough
sir
There
dry
fir
wood
just
ahead
remember
rightly
Sam
knew
the
land
well
within
twenty
miles
Hobbiton
but
that
was
the
limit
his
geography
Just
over
the
top
the
hill
they
came
the
patch
fir
wood
Leaving
the
road
they
went
into
the
deep
resin
scented
darkness
the
trees
and
gathered
dead
sticks
and
cones
make
fire
Soon
they
had
merry
crackle
flame
the
foot
large
fir
tree
and
they
sat
round
for
while
until
they
began
nod
Then
each
angle
the
great
tree
roots
they
curled
their
cloaks
and
blankets
and
were
soon
fast
asleep
They
set
watch
even
Frodo
feared
danger
yet
for
they
were
still
the
heart
the
Shire
few
creatures
came
and
looked
them
when
the
fire
had
died
away
fox
passing
through
the
wood
business
his
own
stopped
several
minutes
and
sniffed
Hobbits
thought
Well
what
next
have
heard
strange
doings
this
land
but
have
seldom
heard
hobbit
sleeping
out
doors
under
tree
Three
them
There
something
mighty
queer
behind
this
was
quite
right
but
never
found
out
any
more
about
The
morning
came
pale
and
clammy
Frodo
woke
first
and
found
that
tree
root
had
made
hole
his
back
and
that
his
neck
was
stiff
Walking
for
pleasure
Why
didn
drive
thought
usually
did
the
beginning

expedition
And
all
beautiful

beds
are
sold
the

These

roots

Wake
hobbits
cried
beautiful
morning
What
beautiful
about
said
Pippin
peering
over
the
edge
his
blanket
with
one
eye
Sam
Get
breakfast
ready
for
half
past
nine
Have
you
got
the
bath
water
hot
Sam
jumped
looking
rather
bleary
sir
haven
sir
said
Frodo
stripped
the
blankets
from
Pippin
and
rolled
him
over
and
then
walked
off
the
edge
the
wood
Away
eastward
the
sun
was
rising
red
out
the
mists
that
lay
thick
the
world
Touched
with
gold
and
red
the
autumn
trees
seemed
sailing
rootless
shadowy
sea
little
below
him
the
left
the
road
ran
down
steeply
into
hollow
and
disappeared
When
returned
Sam
and
Pippin
had
got
good
fire
going
Water
shouted
Pippin
Where
the
water
don
keep
water
pockets
said
Frodo
thought
you
had
gone
find
some
said
Pippin
busy
setting
out
the
food
and
cups
You
had
better
now
You
can
come
too
said
Frodo
and
bring
all
the
water
bottles
There
was
stream
the
foot
the
hill
They
filled
their
bottles
and
the
small
camping
kettle
little
fall
where
the
water
fell
few
feet
over
outcrop
grey
stone
was
icy
cold
and
they
spluttered
and
puffed
they
bathed
their
faces
and
hands
When
their
breakfast
was
over
and
their
packs
all
trussed
again
was
after
ten
clock
and
the
day
was
beginning
turn
fine
and
hot
They
went
down
the
slope
and
across
the
stream
where
dived
under
the
road
and
the
next
slope
and
and
down
another
shoulder
the
hills
and
that
time
their
cloaks
blankets
water
food
and
other
gear
already
seemed
heavy
burden
The
day
march
promised
warm
and
tiring
work
After
some
miles
however
the
road
ceased
roll
and
down
climbed
the
top
steep
bank
weary
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
zig
zagging
sort
way
and
then
prepared
down
for
the
last
time
front
them
they
saw
the
lower
lands
dotted
with
small
clumps
trees
that
melted
away
the
distance
brown
woodland
haze
They
were
looking
across
the
Woody
End
towards
the
Brandywine
River
The
road
wound
away
before
them
like
piece
string
The
road
goes
for
ever
said
Pippin
but
can
with
out
rest
high
time
for
lunch
sat
down
the
bank
the
side
the
road
and
looked
away
east
into
the
haze
beyond
which
lay
the
River
and
the
end
the
Shire
which
had
spent
all
his
life
Sam
stood
him
His
round
eyes
were
wide
open
for
was
looking
across
lands
had
never
seen
new
horizon
Elves
live
those
woods
asked
Not
that
ever
heard
said
Pippin
Frodo
was
silent
too
was
gazing
eastward
along
the
road
had
never
seen
before
Suddenly
spoke
aloud
but
himself
saying
slowly
The
Road
goes
ever
and
Down
from
the
door
where
began
Now
far
ahead
the
Road
has
gone
And
must
follow
can
Pursuing
with
weary
feet
Until
joins
some
larger
way
Where
many
paths
and
errands
meet
And
whither
then
cannot
say
That
sounds
like
bit
old
Bilbo
rhyming
said
Pippin
one
your
imitations
does
not
sound
altogether
encouraging
don
know
said
Frodo
came
then
was
making
but
may
have
heard
long
ago
Certainly
reminds
very
much
Bilbo
the
last
years
before
went
away
used
often
say
there
was
only
one
Road
that
was
like
great
river
its
springs
were
every
doorstep
and
every
path
was
its
tributary
dangerous
business
THREE
COMPANY
Frodo
going
out
your
door
used
say
You
step
into
the
Road
and
you
don
keep
your
feet
there
knowing
where
you
might
swept
off
you
realize
that
this
the
very
path
that
goes
through
Mirkwood
and
that
you
let
might
take
you
the
Lonely
Mountain
even
further
and
worse
places
used
say
that
the
path
outside
the
front
door
Bag
End
especially
after
had
been
out
for
long
walk
Well
the
Road
won
sweep
anywhere
for
hour
least
said
Pippin
unslinging
his
pack
The
others
followed
his
example
putting
their
packs
against
the
bank
and
their
legs
out
into
the
road
After
rest
they
had
good
lunch
and
then
more
rest
The
sun
was
beginning
get
low
and
the
light
afternoon
was
the
land
they
went
down
the
hill
far
they
had
not
met
soul
the
road
This
way
was
not
much
used
being
hardly
fit
for
carts
and
there
was
little
traffic
the
Woody
End
They
had
been
jogging
along
again
for
hour
more
when
Sam
stopped
moment
listening
They
were
now
level
ground
and
the
road
after
much
winding
lay
straight
ahead
through
grass
land
sprinkled
with
tall
trees
outliers
the
approaching
woods
can
hear
pony
horse
coming
along
the
road
behind
said
Sam
They
looked
back
but
the
turn
the
road
prevented
them
from
seeing
far
wonder
that
Gandalf
coming
after
said
Frodo
but
even
said
had
feeling
that
was
not
and
sudden
desire
hide
from
the
view
the
rider
came
over
him
may
not
matter
much
said
apologetically
but
would
rather
not
seen
the
road
anyone
sick
doings
being
noticed
and
discussed
And
Gandalf
added
afterthought
can
give
him
little
surprise
pay
him
out
for
being
late
Let
get
out
sight
The
other
two
ran
quickly
the
left
and
down
into
little
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
hollow
not
far
from
the
road
There
they
lay
flat
Frodo
hesitated
for
second
curiosity
some
other
feeling
was
struggling
with
his
desire
hide
The
sound
hoofs
drew
nearer
Just
time
threw
himself
down
patch
long
grass
behind
tree
that
overshadowed
the
road
Then
lifted
his
head
and
peered
cautiously
above
one
the
great
roots
Round
the
corner
came
black
horse
hobbit
pony
but
full
sized
horse
and
sat
large
man
who
seemed
crouch
the
saddle
wrapped
great
black
cloak
and
hood
that
only
his
boots
the
high
stirrups
showed
below
his
face
was
shadowed
and
invisible
When
reached
the
tree
and
was
level
with
Frodo
the
horse
stopped
The
riding
figure
sat
quite
still
with
its
head
bowed
listening
From
inside
the
hood
came
noise
someone
sniffing
catch
elusive
scent
the
head
turned
from
side
side
the
road
sudden
unreasoning
fear
discovery
laid
hold
Frodo
and
thought
his
Ring
hardly
dared
breathe
and
yet
the
desire
get
out
his
pocket
became
strong
that
began
slowly
move
his
hand
felt
that
had
only
slip
and
then
would
safe
The
advice
Gandalf
seemed
absurd
Bilbo
had
used
the
Ring
And
still
the
Shire
thought
his
hand
touched
the
chain
which
hung
that
moment
the
rider
sat
and
shook
the
reins
The
horse
stepped
forward
walking
slowly
first
and
then
breaking
into
quick
trot
Frodo
crawled
the
edge
the
road
and
watched
the
rider
until
dwindled
into
the
distance
could
not
quite
sure
but
seemed
him
that
suddenly
before
passed
out
sight
the
horse
turned
aside
and
went
into
the
trees
the
right
Well
call
that
very
queer
and
indeed
disturbing
said
Frodo
himself
walked
towards
his
companions
Pippin
and
Sam
had
remained
flat
the
grass
and
had
seen
nothing
Frodo
described
the
rider
and
his
strange
behaviour
THREE
COMPANY
can
say
why
but
felt
certain
was
looking
smelling
for
and
also
felt
certain
that
did
not
want
him
discover
never
seen
felt
anything
like
the
Shire
before
But
what
has
one
the
Big
People
got
with
said
Pippin
And
what
doing
this
part
the
world
There
are
some
Men
about
said
Frodo
Down
the
Southfarthing
they
have
had
trouble
with
Big
People
believe
But
have
never
heard
anything
like
this
rider
wonder
where
comes
from
Begging
your
pardon
put
Sam
suddenly
know
where
comes
from
from
Hobbiton
that
this
here
black
rider
comes
unless
there
more
than
one
And
know
where
going
What
you
mean
said
Frodo
sharply
looking
him
astonishment
Why
didn
you
speak
before
have
only
just
remembered
sir
was
like
this
when
got
back
our
hole
yesterday
evening
with
the
key
dad
says
Hallo
Sam
says
thought
you
were
away
with
Frodo
this
morning
There
been
strange
customer
asking
for
Baggins
Bag
End
and
only
just
gone
Eve
sent
him
Bucklebury
Not
that
liked
the
sound
him
seemed
mighty
put
out
when
told
him
Baggins
had
left
his
old
home
for
good
Hissed
did
gave
quite
shudder
What
sort
fellow
was
says
the
Gaffer
don
know
says
but
wasn
hobbit
was
tall
and
black
like
and
stooped
over
reckon
was
one
the
Big
Folk
from
foreign
parts
spoke
funny
couldn
stay
hear
more
sir
since
you
were
waiting
and
didn
give
much
heed
myself
The
Gaffer
getting
old
and
more
than
bit
blind
and
must
have
been
near
dark
when
this
fellow
come
the
Hill
and
found
him
taking
the
air
the
end
our
Row
hope
hasn
done
harm
sir
nor
The
Gaffer
can
blamed
anyway
said
Frodo
matter
fact
heard
him
talking
stranger
who
seemed
inquiring
for
and
nearly
went
and
asked
him
who
IOO
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
was
wish
had
you
had
told
about
before
might
have
been
more
careful
the
road
Still
there
may
connexion
between
this
rider
and
the
Gaffer
stranger
said
Pippin
left
Hobbiton
secretly
enough
and
don
see
how
could
have
followed
What
about
the
smelling
sir
said
Sam
And
the
Gaffer
said
was
black
chap
wish
had
waited
for
Gandalf
Frodo
muttered
But
perhaps
would
only
have
made
matters
worse
Then
you
know
guess
something
about
this
rider
said
Pippin
who
had
caught
the
muttered
words
don
know
and
would
rather
not
guess
said
Frodo
All
right
cousin
Frodo
You
can
keep
your
secret
for
the
present
you
want
mysterious
the
meanwhile
what
are
should
like
bite
and
sup
but
somehow
think
had
better
move
from
here
Your
talk
sniffing
riders
with
invisible
noses
has
unsettled
Yes
think
will
move
now
said
Frodo
but
not
the
road
case
that
rider
comes
back
another
follows
him
ought
good
step
more
today
Buckland
still
miles
away
The
shadows
the
trees
were
long
and
thin
the
grass
they
started
off
again
They
now
kept
stone
throw
the
left
the
road
and
kept
out
sight
much
they
could
But
this
hindered
them
for
the
grass
was
thick
and
tussocky
and
the
ground
uneven
and
the
trees
began
draw
together
into
thickets
The
sun
had
gone
down
red
behind
the
hills
their
backs
and
evening
was
coming
before
they
came
back
the
road
the
end
the
long
level
over
which
had
run
straight
for
some
miles
that
point
bent

went
down
into

said
Frodo
Not
far
from

they
came
the

was
still
alive
and
had

the
small

THREE

IOI
that
had
put
out
round
the
broken
stumps
its
long
fallen
limbs
but
was
hollow
and
could
entered
great
crack
the
side
away
from
the
road
The
hobbits
crept
inside
and
sat
there
upon
floor
old
leaves
and
decayed
wood
They
rested
and
had
light
meal
talking
quietly
and
listening
from
time
time
Twilight
was
about
them
they
crept
back
the
lane
The
West
wind
was
sighing
the
branches
Leaves
were
whispering
Soon
the
road
began
fall
gently
but
steadily
into
the
dusk
star
came
out
above
the
trees
the
darkening
East
before
them
They
went
abreast
and
step
keep
their
spirits
After
time
the
stars
grew
thicker
and
brighter
the
feeling
disquiet
left
them
and
they
longer
listened
for
the
sound
hoofs
They
began
hum
softly
hobbits
have
way
doing
they
walk
along
especially
when
they
are
drawing
near

With
most
hobbits
supper

song
but
these
hobbits
hummed
walking
song
though
not
course
without
any
mention
supper
and
bed
Bilbo
Baggins
had
made
the
words
tune
that
was
old
the

and
taught
Frodo
they
walked
the
lanes
the
Water

and
talked
about

Upon

Beneath

But

THE

Tomorrow
may
come
this
way
And
take
the
hidden
paths
that
run
Towards
the
Moon
the
Sun
Apple
thorn

and

Let
them
Let
them
Sand

and

and

Fare
you
well
Fare
you
well
Home
behind
the

ahead
And
there
are
many
paths
tread
Through
shadows
the
edge
night
Until
the
stars
are
all
alight
Then
world
behind
and
home
ahead
wander
back
home
and
bed
Mist
and
twilight
cloud
and

Away

Away

Fire

and
meat
and

And
then
bed
And
then

The
song
ended
And
now
bed
And
now
bed
sang
Pippin
high
voice
Hush
said
Frodo
think
hear
hoofs
again
They
stopped
suddenly
and
stood
silent
tree
shadows
listening
There
was
sound
hoofs
the
lane
some
way
behind
but
coming
slow
and
clear
down
the
wind
Quickly
and
quietly
they
slipped
off
the
path
and
ran
into
the
deeper
shade
under
the
oak
trees
Don
let
too
far
said
Frodo
don
want
seen
but
want
see
another
Black
Rider
Very
well
said
Pippin
But
don
forget
the
sniffing
The
hoofs
drew
nearer
They
had
time
find
any
hiding
place
better
than
the
general
darkness
under
the
trees
Sam
and
Pippin
crouched
behind
large
tree
bole
while
Frodo
crept
back
few
yards
towards
the
lane
showed
grey
and
pale
line
fading
light
through
the
wood
Above
the
stars
were
thick
the
dim
sky
but
there
was
moon
The
sound
hoofs
stopped
Frodo
watched
saw
THREE

something
dark
pass
across
the
lighter
space
between
two
trees
and
then
halt
looked
like
the
black
shade
horse
led
smaller
black
shadow
The
black
shadow
stood
close
the
point
where
they
had
left
the
path
and
swayed
from
side
side
Frodo
thought
heard
the
sound
snuffling
The
shadow
bent
the
ground
and
then
began
crawl
towards
him
Once
more
the
desire
slip
the
Ring
came
over
Frodo
but
this
time
was
stronger
than
before
strong
that
almost
before
realized
what
was
doing
his
hand
was
groping
his
pocket
But
that
moment
there
came
sound
like
mingled
song
and
laughter
Clear
voices
rose
and
fell
the
starlit
air
The
black
shadow
straightened
and
retreated
climbed
the
shadowy
horse
and
seemed
vanish
across
the
lane
into
the
darkness
the
other
side
Frodo
breathed
again
Elves
exclaimed
Sam
hoarse
whisper
Elves
sir
would
have
burst
out
the
trees
and
dashed
off
towards
the
voices
they
had
not
pulled
him
back
Yes
Elves
said
Frodo
One
can
meet
them
some
times
the
Woody
End
They
don
live
the
Shire
but
they
wander
into
spring
and
autumn
out
their
own
lands
away
beyond
the
Tower
Hills
thankful
that
they
You
did
not
see
but
that
Black
Rider
stopped
just
here
and
was
actually
crawling
towards
when
the
song
began
soon
heard
the
voices
slipped
away
What
about
the
Elves
said
Sam
too
excited
trouble
about
the
rider
Can
and
see
them
Listen
They
are
coming
this
way
said
Frodo
have
only
wait
The
singing
drew
nearer
One
clear
voice
rose
now
above
the
others
was
singing
the
fair
elven
tongue
which
Frodo
knew
only
little
and
the
others
knew
nothing
Yet
the
sound
blending
with
the
melody
seemed
shape
itself
their
thought
into
words
which
they
only
partly
under
stood
This
was
the
song
Frodo
heard

Not

Middle

This
indeed
strange
chance
The
hobbits
sat
shadow
the
wayside
Before
long
the
Elves
came
down
the
lane
towards
the
valley
They
passed
slowly
and
the
hobbits
could
see
the
starlight
glimmering
their
hair
and
their
eyes
They
bore
lights
yet
they
walked
shimmer
like
the
light
the
moon
above
the
rim
the
hills
before
rises
seemed
fall
about
their
feet
They
were
now
silent
and
the
last
Elf
passed
turned
and
looked
towards
the
hobbits
and
laughed
Hail
Frodo
cried
You
are
abroad
late
are
you
perhaps
lost
Then
called
aloud
the
others
and
all
the
company
stopped
and
gathered
round

The

said
Frodo
simply
that
seem
going
the
same
way
you
are
like
walking
under
the
stars
But
would
welcome
your
company
But
have
need
other
company
and
hobbits
are

they
laughed
And
how
you
know
that
the

you
for
you
not

whither
are

And
how

But

Come
now
Frodo
tell
what
you

doing
For
see
that
there
some
shadow
fear
upon
you
Wise

interrupted
Pippin
eagerly
Tell
about
the
Black

Black
Riders
they
said
low
voices
Why
you
ask
about
Black
Riders
Because
two
Black
Riders
have
overtaken
today
one
has
done

said
Pippin
only
little
while
ago
slipped
away
you
drew
near
The
Elves
did
not
answer
once
but
spoke
together
softly
their
own

Gildor
turned
the
hobbits

not
speak

said
think
you
had
best
come

custom
but
for

take
you
our

Come

You

you

They
now
marched
again
silence
and
passed
like
shadows
and
faint
lights
for
Elves
even
more
than
hobbits
could
walk
when
they
wished
without

Pippin

and
staggered

Sam
walked

with

his

half
fear
and
half
astonished
joy
The
woods
either
side
became
denser
the
trees
were
now
younger
and
thicker
and
the
lane
went
lower
running
down
into

the

there
were
many

the

Suddenly

the

The

Pippin

the

there
was

The

Some

But

his

Now

spoke
those

Frodo
remained
long

talking
with
Gildor
They
spoke
many
things
old
and

and
Frodo
ques

Gildor
much
about

were

Tell

You
are

you
doubt
that

what

that

Frodo

looked
down
Sam

gently
The

said
Frodo
Then
you
know
why
leaving
the

not
know
for
what
reason
the

pursuing
you
answered
Gildor
but
perceive
that
strange
indeed
though
that
seems
And
warn
you
that
peril
now
both
before
you

behind
you
and
upon

You

feared
that
they
were

the

What
are
the
Black

Has
Gandalf
told
you
nothing
Nothing

Then
think
not
for

more
lest
terror
should
keep
you
from

For
seems
that
you

indeed
you

You
must
now
make

and
neither
stay

any

you

you

therefore

Now
wondering
what
can
have
happened
Should
wait

Gildor
was
silent
for

That

late

But
said

they
are

You

you

Gandalf

then
also
advise

not

Take

Now
you

Then

Pippin
was
already
nearly
hot

been

day
before
but

were

from
the
West
looked
likely
turn

The
hobbits
scrambled
down
steep
green
bank
and
plunged
into
the
thick
trees
below
Their
course
had
been
chosen
leave
Woodhall
their
left
and
cut
slanting
through
the
woods
that
clustered
along
the
eastern
side
the
hills
until
they
reached
the
flats
beyond
Then
they
could
make
straight
for
the

over
country
that
was
open
except
for
few
ditches
and
fences

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Frodo
reckoned
they
had
eighteen
miles
straight
line
soon
found
that
the
thicket
was
closer
and
more
tangled
than
had
appeared
There
were
paths
the
under
growth
and
they
did
not
get
very
fast
When
they
had
struggled
the
bottom
the
bank
they
found
stream
running
down
from
the
hills
behind
deeply
dug
bed
with
steep
slippery
sides
overhung
with
brambles
Most
incon
veniently
cut
across
the
line
they
had
chosen
They
could
not
jump
over
nor
indeed
get
across
all
without
getting
wet
scratched
and
muddy
They
halted
wondering
what
First
check
said
Pippin
smiling
grimly
Sam
Gamgee
looked
back
Through
opening
the
trees
caught
glimpse
the
top
the
green
bank
from
which
they
had
climbed
down
Look
said
clutching
Frodo
the
arm
They
all
looked
and
the
edge
high
above
them
they
saw
against
the
sky
horse
standing
Beside
stooped
black
figure
They
once
gave
any
idea
going
back
Frodo
led
the
way
and
plunged
quickly
into
the
thick
bushes
beside
the
stream
Whew
said
Pippin
were
both
right
The
short
cut
has
gone
crooked
already
but
got
under
cover
only
just
time
You
got
sharp
ears
Sam
can
you
hear
anything
coming
They
stood
still
almost
holding
their
breath
they
listened
but
there
was
sound
pursuit
don
fancy
would
try
bringing
his
horse
down
that
bank
said
Sam
But
guess
knows
came
down
had
better
going
Going
was
not
altogether
easy
They
had
packs
carry
and
the
bushes
and
brambles
were
reluctant
let
them
through
They
were
cut
off
from
the
wind
the
ridge
behind
and
the
air
was
still
and
stuffy
When
they
forced
their
way
last
into
more
open
ground
they
were
hot
and
tired
and
very
scratched
and
they
were
also
longer
certain
the
direction
which
they
were
going
The
banks
the
stream
sank
reached
the
levels
and
became
broader
and
shallower
wandering
off
towards
the
Marish
and

Why
this
the
Stock
brook
said
Pippin
are
going
try
and
get
back
our
course
must
cross
once
and
bear
right
They
waded
the
stream
and
hurried
over
wide
open
space
rush
grown
and
treeless
the
further
side
Beyond
that
they
came
again
belt
trees
tall
oaks
for
the
most
part
with
here
and
there
elm
tree
ash
The
ground
was
fairly
level
and
there
was
little
undergrowth
but
the
trees
were
too
close
for
them
see
far
ahead
The
leaves
blew
upwards
sudden
gusts
wind
and
spots
rain
began
fall
from
the
overcast
sky
Then
the
wind
died
away
and
the
rain
came
streaming
down
They
trudged
along
fast
they
could
over
patches
grass
and
through
thick
drifts
old
leaves
and
all
about
them
the
rain
pattered
and
trickled
They
did
not
talk
but
kept
glancing
back
and
from
side
side
After
half
hour
Pippin
said
hope
have
not
turned
too
much
towards
the
south
and
are
not
walking
longwise
through
this

said
Frodo
That

matters
Let
keep
are
going
not
sure
that
want
come
out
into
the
open
yet
They
went
for
perhaps
another
couple
miles
Then
the
sun
gleamed
out
ragged
clouds
again
and
the
rain
lessened
was
now
past
mid
day
and
they
felt
was
high
time
for
lunch
They
halted
under
elm
tree
its
leaves
though
fast
turning
yellow
were
still
thick
and
the
ground
its
feet
was
fairly
dry
and
sheltered
When
they
came
make
their
meal
they
found
that
the
Elves
had
filled
their
bottles
with
clear
drink
pale

colour
had
the

Very

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Frodo
propped
his
back
against
the
tree
trunk
and
closed
his
eyes
Sam
and
Pippin
sat
near
and
they
began
hum
and
then
sing
softly
the
bottle
heal
heart
and
drown
woe
Rain
may
fall
and
wind
may
blow
And
many
miles
still
But
under
tall
tree
will
lie
And
let
the
clouds
sailing
they
began
again
louder
They
stopped
short
suddenly
Frodo
sprang
his
feet
long
drawn
wail
came
down
the
wind
like
the
cry
some
evil
and
lonely
creature
rose
and
fell
and
ended
high
piercing
note
Even
they
sat
and
stood
suddenly
frozen
was
answered
another
cry
fainter
and
further
off
but
less
chilling
the
blood
There
was
then
silence
broken
only
the
sound
the
wind
the
leaves
And
what
you
think
that
was
Pippin
asked
last
trying
speak
lightly
but
quavering
little
was

was
one
that
never

Frodo

there
were

that
cry
though
could
not
catch
them
But

such

more

said
about
They
were
all
thinking
the
Riders
but
one
spoke
them
They
were
now
reluctant
either
stay
but
sooner
later
they
had
got
get
across
the
open
country
the
Ferry
and
was
best
sooner
and
daylight
few
moments
they
had
shoul
dered
their
packs
again
and
were
off
Before
long
the
wood
came
sudden
end
Wide
grass
lands
stretched
before
them
They
now
saw
that
they
had
fact
turned
too
much
the
south
Away
over
the
flats
they
could
glimpse
the
low
hill

across

edge
the
trees
they
set
off
across
the
open
quickly
they
could
first
they
felt
afraid
away
from
the
shelter
the
wood
Far
back
behind
them
stood
the
high
place
where
they
had
breakfasted
Frodo
half
expected
see
the
small
distant
figure
horseman
the
ridge
dark
against
the
sky
but
there
was
sign
one
The
sun
escaping
from
the
breaking
clouds
sank
towards
the
hills
they
had
left
was
now
shining
brightly
again
Their
fear
left
them
though
they
still
felt
uneasy
But
the
land
became
steadily
more
tame
and
well
ordered
Soon
they
came
into
well
tended
fields
and
meadows
there
were
hedges
and
gates
and
dikes
for
drainage
Everything
seemed
quiet
and
peaceful
just
ordinary
corner
the
Shire
Their
spirits
rose
with
every
step
The
line
the
River
grew
nearer
and
the
Black
Riders
began
seem
like
phantoms
the
woods
now
left
far
behind
They
passed
along
the
edge
huge
turnip
field
and
came
stout
gate
Beyond
rutted
lane
ran
between
low
well
laid
hedges
towards
distant
clump

Pippin
stopped
know
these
fields
and
this

said
This

Farmer

That

One
trouble

said
Frodo
looking
nearly
much
alarmed
Pippin
had
declared
the

was

leading

The

looked

What

have
never

over
the

though

the

knew
their

and
would

Pippin
laughed
Well

Especially

and
used

with
him

They
went
along
the
lane
until
they
saw
the
thatched
roofs
large
house
and
farm
buildings
peeping
out
among
the
trees
ahead
The
Maggots
and
the
Puddifoots
Stock
and
most
the
inhabitants
the
Marish
were
house
dwellers
and
this
farm
was
stoutly
built
brick
and
had
high
wall
all
round
There
was
wide
wooden
gate
opening
out
the
wall
into
the
lane
Suddenly
they
drew
nearer
terrific
baying
and
barking
broke
out
and
loud
voice
was
heard
shouting
Grip
Fang
Wolf
Come
lads
Frodo
and
Sam
stopped
dead
but
Pippin
walked
few
paces
The
gate
opened
and
three
huge
dogs
came
pelting
out
into
the
lane
and
dashed
towards
the
travellers
barking
fiercely
They
took
notice
Pippin
but
Sam
shrank
against
the
wall
while
two
wolvish
looking
dogs
sniffed
him
suspiciously
and
snarled
moved
The
largest
and
most
ferocious
the
three
halted
front
Frodo
bristling
and
growling
Through
the

there
now
appeared

What

the

the

started
and
gave
Frodo
sharp

For
moment
Frodo
thought
that
the
memory
stolen
mushrooms
had
been
aroused
and
that
the
dogs
would

see
him
off
But
Farmer
Maggot
took
him

Well

Baggins

What

bent

called
the

swung
off

rode

What

The

the

Two
Maggot
sons
and
his

The

Mrs

THE

THE

The
hobbits

were

the
creak
the
wheels
and
the
slow
clop

The

seemed
slower

Frodo
Beside

Pippin

quite
fair
without
want
full
account
and
most
all
want
know
what
was
the
matter
with
old
Maggot
and
why
spoke
like
that
sounded
almost
was
scared
that
possible
have
all
been
scared
said
Pippin
after
pause
which
Frodo
stared
the
fire
and
did
not
speak
You
would
have
been
too
you
had
been
chased
for
two
days
Black
Riders
134
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
And
what
are
they
Black
figures
riding
black
horses
answered
Pippin
Frodo
won
talk
will
tell
you
the
whole
tale
from
the
beginning
then
gave
full
account
their
journey
from
the
time
when
they
left
Hobbiton
Sam
gave
various
support
ing
nods
and
exclamations
Frodo
remained
silent
should
think
you
were
malting
all
said
Merry
had
not
seen
that
black
shape
the
landing
stage
and
heard
the
queer
sound
Maggot
voice
What
you
make
all
Frodo
Cousin
Frodo
has
been
very
close
said
Pippin
But
the
time
has
come
for
him
open
out
far
have
been
given
nothing
more
than
Farmer
Maggot
guess
that
has
something
with
old
Bilbo
treasure
That
was
only
guess
said
Frodo
hastily
Maggot
does
not
know
anything
Old
Maggot
shrewd
fellow
said
Merry
lot
goes
behind
his
round
face
that
does
not
come
out
his
talk
heard
that
used
into
the
Old
Forest
one
time
and
has
the
reputation
knowing
good
many
strange
things
But
you
can
least
tell
Frodo
whether
you
think
his
guess
good
bad
think
answered
Frodo
slowly
that
was
good
guess
far
goes
There
connexion
with
Bilbo
old
adven
tures
and
the
Riders
are
looking
perhaps
one
ought
say
searching
for
him
for
also
fear
you
want
know
that
joke
all
and
that
not
safe
here
anywhere
else
looked
round
the
windows
and
walls
was
afraid
they
would
suddenly
give
way
The
others
looked
him
silence
and
exchanged
meaning
glances
among
themselves
coming
out
minute
whispered
Pippin
Merry
Merry
nodded
Well
said
Frodo
last
sitting
and
straightening
his
back
had
made
decision
can
keep
dark
any
longer
have
got
something
tell
you
all
But
don
know
quite
how

think
could
help
you
said
Merry
quietly
telling
you
some
myself
What
you
mean
said
Frodo
looking
him
anxiously
Just
this
dear
old
Frodo
you
are
miserable
because
you
don
know
how
say
good
bye
You
meant
leave
the
Shire
course
But
danger
has
come
you
sooner
than
you
expected
and
now
you
are
making
your
mind
once
And
you
don
want
are
very
sorry
for
you
Frodo
opened
his
mouth
and
shut
again
His
look
surprise
was
comical
that
they
laughed
Dear
old
Frodo
said
Pippin
Did
you
really
think
you
had
thrown
dust
all
our
eyes
You
have
not
been
nearly
careful
clever
enough
for
that
You
have
obviously
been
planning
and
saying
farewell
all
your
haunts
all
this
year
since
April
have
constantly
heard
you
muttering
Shall
ever
look
down
into
that
valley
again
wonder
and
things
like
that
And
pretending
that
you
had
come
the
end
your
money
and
actually
selling
your
beloved
Bag
End
those
Sackville
Bagginses
And
all
those
close
talks
with
Gandalf
Good
heavens
said
Frodo
thought
had
been
both
careful
and
clever
don
know
what
Gandalf
would
say
all
the
Shire
discussing
departure
then
said
Merry
Don
worry
about
that
The
secret
won
keep
for
long
course
but
present
think
only
known
conspirators
After
all
you
must
remember
that
know
you
well
and
are
often
with
you
can
usually
guess
what
you
are
thinking
knew
Bilbo
too
tell
you
the
truth
have
been
watching
you
rather
closely
ever
since
left
thought
you
would
after
him
sooner
later
indeed
expected
you
sooner
and
lately
have
been
very
anxious
have
been
terrified
that
you
might
give
the
slip
and
off
suddenly
all
your
own
like
did
Ever
since
this
spring
have
kept
our
eyes
open
and
done
good
deal
planning
our
own
account
You
are
not
going
escape
easily
But
must
said
Frodo
cannot
helped
dear
friends
wretched
for
all
but
use
your
trying

keep
Since
you
have
guessed
much
please
help
and
not
hinder
You
not
understand
said
Pippin
You
must
and
therefore
must
too
Merry
and
are
coming
with
you
Sam
excellent
fellow
and
would
jump
down
dragon
throat
save
you
did
not
trip
over
his
own
feet
but
you
will
need
more
than
one
companion
your
dangerous
adventure
dear
and
most
beloved
hobbits
said
Frodo
deeply
moved
But
could
not
allow
decided
that
long
ago
too
You
speak
danger
but
you
not
understand
This
treasure
hunt
there
and
back
journey
flying
from
deadly
peril
into
deadly
peril
course
understand
said
Merry
firmly
That
why
have
decided
come
know
the
Ring
laughing
matter
but
are
going
our
best
help
you
against
the
Enemy
The
Ring
said
Frodo
now
completely
amazed
Yes
the
Ring
said
Merry
dear
old
hobbit
you
don
allow
for
the
inquisitiveness
friends
have
known
about
the
existence
the
Ring
for
years
before
Bilbo
went
away
fact
but
since
obviously
regarded
secret
kept
the
knowledge
head
until
formed
our
conspiracy
did
not
know
Bilbo
course
well
know
you
was
too
young
and
was
also
more
careful
but
was
not
care
ful
enough
you
want
know
how
first
found
out
will
tell
you
said
Frodo
faintly
was
the
Sackville
Bagginses
that
were
his
downfall
you
might
expect
One
day
year
before
the
Party
happened
walking
along
the
road
when
saw
Bilbo
ahead
Suddenly
the
distance
the
appeared
coming
towards
Bilbo
slowed
down
and
then
hey
presto
vanished
was
startled
that
hardly
had
the
wits
hide
myself
more
ordinary
fashion
but
got
through
the
hedge
and
walked
along
the
field
inside
was
peeping
through
into
the
road
after
the
had
passed
and
was
looking
straight
Bilbo

when
suddenly
reappeared
caught
glint
gold
put
something
back
his
trouser
pocket
After
that
kept
eyes
open
fact
confess
that
spied
But
you
must
admit
that
was
very
intriguing
and
was
only
teens
must
the
only
one
the
Shire
besides
you
Frodo
that
has
ever
seen
the
old
fellow
secret
book
You
have
read
his
book
cried
Frodo
Good
heavens
above
nothing
safe
Not
too
safe
should
say
said
Merry
But
have
only
had
one
rapid
glance
and
that
was
difficult
get
never
left
the
book
about
wonder
what
became
should
like
another
look
Have
you
got
Frodo
was
not
Bag
End
must
have
taken
away
Well
was
saying
Merry
proceeded
kept
know
ledge
myself
till
this
spring
when
things
got
serious
Then
formed
our
conspiracy
and
were
serious
too
and
meant
business
have
not
been
too
scrupulous
You
are
not
very
easy
nut
crack
and
Gandalf
worse
But
you
want
introduced
our
chief
investigator
can
produce
him
Where
said
Frodo
looking
round
expected
masked
and
sinister
figure
come
out
cupboard
Step
forward
Sam
said
Merry
and
Sam
stood
with
face
scarlet
the
ears
Here
our
collector
infor
mation
And
collected
lot
can
tell
you
before
was
finally
caught
After
which
may
say
seemed
regard
himself
parole
and
dried
Sam
cried
Frodo
feeling
that
amazement
could
further
and
quite
unable
decide
whether
felt
angry
amused
relieved
merely
foolish
Yes
sir
said
Sam
Begging
your
pardon
sir
But
meant
wrong
you
Frodo
nor
Gandalf
for
that
matter
has
some
sense
mind
you
and
when
you
said
alone
said
take
someone
you
can
trust
But
does
not
seem
that
can
trust
anyone
said
Frodo
Sam
looked
him
unhappily
all
depends
what
you
138
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE

want
put
Merry
You
can
trust
stick
you
through
thick
and
thin
the
bitter
end
And
you
can
trust
keep
any
secret
yours
closer
than
you
keep
yourself
But
you
cannot
trust
let
you
face
trouble
alone
and
off
without
word
are
your
friends
Frodo
Anyway
there
know
most
what
Gandalf
has
told
you
know
good
deal
about
the
Ring
are
horribly
afraid
but
are
coming
with
you
following
you
like
hounds
And
after
all
sir
added
Sam
you
did
ought
take
the
Elves
advice
Gildor
said
you
should
take
them
was
will
ing
and
you
can
deny
don
deny
said
Frodo
looking
Sam
who
was
now
grinning
don
deny
but
never
believe
you
are
sleep
ing
again
whether
you
snore
not
shall
kick
you
hard
make
sure
You
are
set
deceitful
scoundrels
said
turning
the
others
But
bless
you
laughed
getting
and
waving
his
arms
give
will
take
Gildor
advice
the
danger
were
not
dark
should
dance
for
joy
Even
cannot
help
feeling
happy
happier
than
have
felt
for
long
time
had
dreaded
this
evening
Good
That
settled
Three
cheers
for
Captain
Frodo
and
company
they
shouted
and
they
danced
round
him
Merry
and
Pippin
began
song
which
they
had
apparently
got
ready
for
the
occasion
was
made
the
model
the
dwarf
song
that
started
Bilbo
his
adventure
long
ago
and
went
the
same
tune
Farewell
call
hearth
and
hall
Though
wind
may
blow
and
rain
may
fall
must
away
ere
break
day
Far
over
wood
and
mountain

Rivendell

Through

With
foes
ahead
behind
dread
Beneath
the
sky
shall
our
bed
Until
last
our
toil
passed
Our
journey
done
our
errand
sped
must
away
must
away
ride
before
the
break
day
Very
good
said
Frodo
But
that
case
there
are
lot
things
before
bed
under
roof
for
tonight
any
rate
That
was
poetry
said
Pippin
you
really
mean
start
before
the
break
day
don
know
answered
Frodo
fear
those
Black
Riders
and
sure
unsafe
stay
one
place
long
especially
place
which
known
was
going
Also
Gildor
advised
not
wait
But
should
very
much
like
see
Gandalf
could
see
that
even
Gildor
was
disturbed
when
heard
that
Gandalf
had
never
appeared
really
depends
two
things
How
soon
could
the
Riders
get
Bucldebury
And
how
soon
could
get
off
will
take
good
deal
preparation
The
answer
the
second
question
said
Merry
that
could
get
off
hour
have
prepared
practically
every
thing
There
are
five
ponies
stable
across
the
fields
stores
and
tackle
are
all
packed
except
for
few
extra
clothes
and
the
perishable
food
seems
have
been
very
efficient
conspiracy
said
Frodo
But
what
about
the
Black
Riders
Would
safe
wait
one
day
for
Gandalf
That
all
depends
what
you
think
the
Riders
would
they
found
you
here
answered
Merry
They
coidd
have
reached
here
now
course
they
were
not
stopped
the
North
gate
where
the
Hedge
runs
down
the
river
bank
just
this
side
the
Bridge
The
gate
guards
would
not
let
them
through
night
though
they
might
break
through
Even
the
daylight
they
would
try
keep
them
out
think
140
THE

THE
RING
any
rate
until
they
got
message
through
the
Master
the
Hall
for
they
would
not
like
the
look
the
Riders
and
would
certainly
frightened
them
But
course
Buckland
cannot
resist
determined
attack
for
long
And
possible
that
the
morning
even
Black
Rider
that
rode
and
asked
for
Baggins
would
let
through
pretty
generally
known
that
you
are
coming
back
live
Crickhollow
Frodo
sat
for
while
thought
have
made
mind
said
finally
starting
tomorrow
soon
light
But
not
going
road
would
safer
wait
here
than
that
through
the
North
gate
departure
from
Buckland
will
known
once
instead
being
secret
for
several
days
least
might
And
what
more
the
Bridge
and
the
East
Road
near
the
borders
will
certainly
watched
whether
any
Rider
gets
into
Buckland
not
don
know
how
many
there
are
but
there
are
least
two
and
possibly
more
The
only
thing
off
quite
unexpected
direction
But
that
can
only
mean
going
into
the
Old
Forest
said
Fredegar
horrified
You
can
thinking
doing
that
quite
dangerous
Black
Riders
Not
quite
said
Merry
sounds
very
desperate
but
believe
Frodo
right
the
only
way
getting
off
without
being
followed
once
With
luck
might
get
considerable
start
But
you
won
have
any
luck
the
Old
Forest
objected
Fredegar
one
ever
has
luck
there
You
get
lost
People
don
there
yes
they
said
Merry
The
Brandybucks
occasionally
when
the
fit
takes
them
have
private
entrance
Frodo
went
once
long
ago
have
been
several
times
usually
daylight
course
when
the
trees
are
sleepy
and
fairly
quiet
Well
you
think
best
said
Fredegar
more
afraid
the
Old
Forest
than
anything
know
about
the
CONSPIRACY

141
stories
about
are
nightmare
but
vote
hardly
counts
not
going
the
journey
Still
very
glad
someone
stopping
behind
who
can
tell
Gandalf
what
you
have
done
when
turns
sure
will
before
long
Fond
was
Frodo
Fatty
Bolger

desire
leave
the
Shire
nor
see
what
lay
outside
His
family
came
from
the

from
Budgeford
Bridgefields
fact
but
had
never
been
over
the
Brandywine
Bridge
His
task
according
the
original
plans
the
conspirators
was
stay
behind
and
deal
with
inquisitive
folk
and
keep
long
possible
the
pretence
that
Baggins
was
still
living
Crickhollow
had
even
brought
along
some
old
clothes
Frodo
help
him
playing
the
part
They
little
thought
how
dangerous
that
part
might
prove
Excellent
said
Frodo
when
understood
the
plan
could
not
have
left
any
message
behind
for
Gandalf
other
wise
don
know
whether
these
Riders
can
read
not
course
but
should
not
have
dared
risk
written
message
case
they
got
and
searched
the
house
But
Fatty
willing
hold
the
fort
and
can
sure
Gandalf
knowing
the
way
have
gone
that
decides
going
into
the
Old
Forest
first
thing
tomorrow
Well
that
that
said
Pippin
the
whole
would
rather
have
our
job
than
Fatty
waiting
here
till
Black
Riders
come
You
wait
till
you
are
well
inside
the
Forest
said
Fredegar
You
wish
you
were
back
here
with
before
this
time
tomorrow
good
arguing
about
any
more
said
Merry
have
still
got
tidy
and
put
the
finishing
touches
the
packing
before
get
bed
shall
call
you
all
before
the
break
day
When
last
had
got
bed
Frodo
could
not
sleep
for
some
time
His
legs
ached
was
glad
that
was
riding
the
morning
Eventually
fell
into
vague
dream
which
seemed
looking
out
high
window
over
dark
142
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
sea
tangled
trees
Down
below
among
the
roots
there
was
the
sound
creatures
crawling
and
snuffling
felt
sure
they
would
smell
him
out
sooner
later
Then
heard
noise
the
distance
first
thought
was
great
wind
coming
over
the
leaves
the
forest
Then
knew
that
was
not
leaves
but
the
sound
the
Sea
far
off
sound
had
never
heard
waking
life
though
had
often
troubled
his
dreams
Suddenly
found
was
out
the
open
There
were
trees
after
all
was
dark
heath
and
there
was
strange
salt
smell
the
air
Looking
saw
before
him
tall
white
tower
standing
alone
high
ridge
great
desire
came
over
him
climb
the
tower
and
see
the
Sea
started
struggle
the
ridge
towards
the
tower
but
suddenly
light
came
the
sky
and
there
was
noise
thunder
Chapter
THE
OLD
FOREST
Frodo
woke
suddenly
was
still
dark
the
room
Merry
was
standing
there
with
candle
one
hand
and
banging
the
door
with
the
other
All
right
What
said
Frodo
still
shaken
and
bewildered
What
cried
Merry
time
get
half
past
four
and
very
foggy
Come
Sam
already
getting
breakfast
ready
Even
Pippin
just
going
saddle
the
ponies
and
fetch
the
one
that
the
baggage
carrier
Wake
that
sluggard
Fatty
least
must
get
and
see
off
Soon
after
six
clock
the
five
hobbits
were
ready
start
Fatty
Bolger
was
still
yawning
They
stole
quietly
out
the
house
Merry
went
front
leading
laden
pony
and
took
his
way
along
path
that
went
through
spinney
behind
the
house
and
then
cut
across
several
fields
The
leaves
trees
were
glistening
and
every
twig
was
dripping
the
grass
was
grey
with
cold
dew
Everything
was
still
and
far
away
noises
seemed
near
and
clear
fowls
chattering
yard
someone
closing
door
distant
house
their
shed
they
found
the
ponies
sturdy
little
beasts
the
kind
loved
hobbits
not
speedy
but
good
for
long
day
work
They
mounted
and
soon
they
were
riding
off
into
the
mist
which
seemed
open
reluctantly
before
them
and
close
forbiddingly
behind
them
After
riding
for
about
hour
slowly
and
without
talking
they
saw
the
Hedge
looming
suddenly
ahead
was
tall
and
netted
over
with
silver
cobwebs
How
are
you
going
get
through
this
asked
Fredegar
Follow
said
Merry
and
you
will
see
turned

along
the
Hedge
and
soon
they
came

where
bent

along
the

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
had
been
made
some
distance
from
the
Hedge
and
went
sloping
gently
down
into
the
ground
had
walls
brick
the
sides
which
rose
steadily
until
suddenly
they
arched
over
and
formed
tunnel
that
dived
deep
under
the
Hedge
and
came
out
the
hollow
the
other
side
Here
Fatty
Bolger
halted
Good
bye
Frodo
said
wish
you
were
not
going
into
the
Forest
only
hope
you
will
not
need
rescuing
before
the
day
out
But
good
luck
you
today
and
every
day
there
are
worse
things
ahead
than
the
Old
Forest
shall
lucky
said
Frodo
Tell
Gandalf
hurry
along
the
East
Road
shall
soon
back
and
going
fast
can
Good
bye
they
cried
and
rode
down
the
slope
and
disappeared
from
Fredegar
sight
into
the
tunnel
was
dark
and
damp
the
far
end
was
closed
gate
thick
set
iron
bars
Merry
got
down
and
unlocked
the
gate
and
when
they
had
all
passed
through
pushed
again
shut
with
clang
and
the
lock
clicked
The
sound
was
ominous
There
said
Merry
You
have
left
the
Shire
and
are
now
outside
and
the
edge
the
Old
Forest
Are
the
stories
about
true
asked
Pippin
don
know
what
stories
you
mean
Merry
answered
you
mean
the
old
bogey
stories
Fatty
nurses
used
tell
him
about
goblins
and
wolves
and
things
that
sort
should
say
any
rate
don
believe
them
But
the
Forest
queer
Everything
very
much
more
alive
more
aware
what
going
speak
than
things
are
the
Shire
And
the
trees
not
like
strangers
They
watch
you
They
are
usually
content
merely
watch
you
long
daylight
lasts
and
don
much
Occasionally
the
most
unfriendly
ones
may
drop
branch
stick
root
out
grasp
you
with
long
trailer
But
night
things
can
most
alarming
told
have
only
once
twice
been
here
after
dark
and
then
only
near
the
hedge
thought
all
the
trees
were
whispering
each
other
passing
news
and
plots
along
unintelligible
language
and
the

branches
swayed
and
groped
without
any
wind
They
say
the
trees
actually
move
and
can
surround
strangers
and
hem
them
fact
long
ago
they
attacked
the
Hedge
they
came
and
planted
themselves
right
and
leaned
over
But
the
hobbits
came
and
cut
down
hundreds
trees
and
made
great
bonfire
the
Forest
and
burned
all
the
ground
long
strip
east
the
Hedge
After
that
the
trees
gave
the
attack
but
they
became
very
unfriendly
There
still
wide
bare
space
not
far
inside
where
the
bonfire
was
made
only
the
trees
that
are
dangerous
asked
Pippin
There
are
various
queer
things
living
deep
the
Forest
and
the
far
side
said
Merry
least
have
heard
but
have
never
seen
any
them
But
something
makes
paths
Whenever
one
comes
inside
one
finds
open
tracks
but
they
seem
shift
and
change
from
time
time
queer
fashion
Not
far
from
this
tunnel
there
was
for
long
time
the
beginning
quite
broad
path
leading
the
Bonfire
Glade
and
then
more
less
our
direction
east
and
little
north
That
the
path
going
try
and
find
The
hobbits
now
left
the
tunnel
gate
and
rode
across
the
wide
hollow
the
far
side
was
faint
path
leading
the
floor
the
Forest
hundred
yards
and
more
beyond
the
Hedge
but
vanished
soon
brought
them
under
the
trees
Looking
back
they
could
see
the
dark
line
the
Hedge
through
the
stems
trees
that
were
already
thick
about
them
Looking
ahead
they
could
see
only
tree
trunks
innumerable
sizes
and
shapes
straight
bent
twisted
leaning
squat
slender
smooth
gnarled
and
branched
and
all
the
stems
were
green
grey
with
moss
and
slimy
shaggy
growths
Merry
alone
seemed
fairly
cheerful
You
had
better
lead
and
find
that
path
Frodo
said
him
Don
let
lose
one
another
forget
which
way
the
Hedge
lies
They
picked
way
among
the
trees
and
their
ponies
plodded
along
carefully
avoiding
the
many
writhing
and
interlacing
roots
There
was
undergrowth
The
ground
146
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
was
rising
steadily
and
they
went
forward
seemed
that
the
trees
became
taller
darker
and
thicker
There
was
sound
except
occasional
drip
moisture
falling
through
the
still
leaves
For
the
moment
there
was
whispering
movement
among
the
branches
but
they
all
got
uncom
fortable
feeling
that
they
were
being
watched
with
dis
approval
deepening
dislike
and
even
enmity
The
feeling
steadily
grew
until
they
found
themselves
looking
quickly
glancing
back
over
their
shoulders
they
expected
sudden
blow
There
was
not
yet
any
sign
path
and
the
trees
seemed
constantly
bar
their
way
Pippin
suddenly
felt
that
could
not
bear
any
longer
and
without
warning
let
out
shout
cried
not
going
anything
Just
let
pass
through
will
you
The
others
halted
startled
but
the
cry
fell
muffled
heavy
curtain
There
was
echo
answer
though
the
wood
seemed
become
more
crowded
and
more
watchful
than
before
should
not
shout
were
you
said
Merry
does
more
harm
than
good
Frodo
began
wonder
were
possible
find
way
through
and
had
been
right
make
the
others
come
into
this
abominable
wood
Merry
was
looking
from
side
side
and
seemed
already
uncertain
which
way
Pippin
noticed
has
not
taken
you
long
lose
said
But
that
moment
Merry
gave
whistle
relief
and
pointed
ahead
Well
well
said
These
trees
shift
There
the
Bonfire
Glade
front
hope
but
the
path
seems
have
moved
away
The
light
grew
clearer
they
went
forward
Suddenly
they
came
out
the
trees
and
found
themselves
wide
circular
space
There
was
sky
above
them
blue
and
clear
their
surprise
for
down
under
the
Forest
roof
they
had
not
been
able
see
the
rising
morning
and
the
lifting
the
mist
The
sun
was
not
however
high
enough
yet
shine
down
into
THE
OLD
FOREST
147
the
clearing
though
its
light
was
the
tree
tops
The
leaves
were
all
thicker
and
greener
about
the
edges
the
glade
enclosing
with
almost
solid
wall
tree
grew
there
only
rough
grass
and
many
tall
plants
stalky
and
faded
hem
locks
and
wood
parsley
fire
weed
seeding
into
fluffy
ashes
and
rampant
nettles
and
thistles
dreary
place
but
seemed
charming
and
cheerful
garden
after
the
close
Forest
The
hobbits
felt
encouraged
and
looked
hopefully
the
broadening
daylight
the
sky
the
far
side
the
glade
there
was
break
the
wall
trees
and
clear
path
beyond
They
could
see
running
into
the
wood
wide
places
and
open
above
though
every
now
and
again
the
trees
drew
and
overshadowed
with
their
dark
boughs
this
path
they
rode
They
were
still
climbing
gently
but
they
now
went
much
quicker
and
with
better
heart
for
seemed
them
that
the
Forest
had
relented
and
was
going
let
them
pass
unhindered
after
all
But
after
while
the
air
began
get
hot
and
stuffy
The
trees
drew
close
again
either
side
and
they
could
longer
see
far
ahead
Now
stronger
than
ever
they
felt
again
the
ill
will
the
wood
pressing
them
silent
was
that
the
fall
their
ponies
hoofs
rustling
dead
leaves
and
occasionally
stumbling
hidden
roots
seemed
thud
their
ears
Frodo
tried
sing
song
encourage
them
but
his
voice
sank
murmur
Wanderers
the
shadowed
land
despair
not
For
though
dark
they
stand
all
woods
there
must
end
last
and
see
the
open
sun
past
the
setting
sun
the
rising
sun
the
day
end
the
day
begun
For
east
west
all
woods
must
fail
Fail
even
said
the
word
his
voice
faded
into
silence
The
air
seemed
heavy
and
the
making
words
wearisome
Just
behind
them
large
branch
fell
from
old
overhanging
148
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
tree
with
crash
into
the
path
The
trees
seemed
close
before
them
They
not
like
all
that
about
ending
and
failing
said
Merry
should
not
sing
any
more
present
Wait
till
get
the
edge
and
then
turn
and
give
them
rousing
chorus
spoke
cheerfully
and
felt
any
great
anxiety
did
not
show
The
others
did
not
answer
They
were
depressed
heavy
weight
was
settling
steadily
Frodo
heart
and
regretted
now
with
every
step
forward
that
had
ever
thought
challenging
the
menace
the
trees
was
indeed
just
about
stop
and
propose
going
back
that
was
still
possible
when
things
took
new
turn
The
path
stopped
climbing
and
became
for
while
nearly
level
The
dark
trees
drew
aside
and
ahead
they
could
see
the
path
going
almost
straight
forward
Before
them
but
some
distance
off
there
stood
green
hill
top
treeless
rising
like
bald
head
out
the
encircling
wood
The
path
seemed
making
directly
for
They
now
hurried
forward
again
delighted
with
the
thought
climbing
out
for
while
above
the
roof
the
Forest
The
path
dipped
and
then
again
began
climb
upwards
leading
them
last
the
foot
the
steep
hillside
There
left
the
trees
and
faded
into
the
turf
The
wood
stood
all
round
the
hill
like
thick
hair
that
ended
sharply
circle
round
shaven
crown
The
hobbits
led
their
ponies
winding
round
and
round
until
they
reached
the
top
There
they
stood
and
gazed
about
them
The
air
was
gleaming
and
sunlit
but
hazy
and
they
could
not
see
any
great
distance
Near
hand
the
mist
was
now
almost
gone
though
here
and
there
lay
hollows
the
wood
and
the
south
them
out
deep
fold
cutting
right
across
the
Forest
the
fog
still
rose
like
steam
wisps
white
smoke
That
said
Merry
pointing
with
his
hand
that
the
line

Withywindle

down
out

Downs
and

Brandywine

don
want
that
way
The
Withywindle
valley
said
the
queerest
part
the
whole
wood
the
centre
from
which
all
the
queerness
comes
were
The
others
looked
the
direction
that
Merry
pointed
out
but
they
could
see
little
but
mists
over
the
damp
and
deep
cut
valley
and
beyond
the
southern
half
the
Forest
faded
from
view
The
sun
the
hill
top
was
now
getting
hot
must
have
been
about
eleven
clock
but
the
autumn
haze
still
pre
vented
them
from
seeing
much
other
directions
the
west
they
could
not
make
out
either
the
line
the
Hedge
the
valley
the
Brandywine
beyond
Northward
where
they
looked
most
hopefully
they
could
see
nothing
that
might
the
line
the
great
East
Road
for
which
they
were
making
They
were
island
sea
trees
and
the
horizon
was
veiled
the
south
eastern
side
the
ground
fell
very
steeply
the
slopes
the
hill
were
continued
far
down
under
the
trees
like
island
shores
that
really
are
the
sides
mountain
rising
out
deep
waters
They
sat
the
green
edge
and
looked
out
over
the
woods
below
them
while
they
ate
their
mid
day
meal
the
sun
rose
and
passed
noon
they
glimpsed
far
off
the
east
the
grey
green
lines
the
Downs
that
lay
beyond
the
Old
Forest
that
side
That
cheered
them
greatly
for
was
good
see
sight
anything
beyond
the
wood
borders
though
they
did
not
mean
that
way
they
could
help
the
Barrow
downs
had
sinister
reputation
hobbit
legend
the
Forest
itself
length
they
made
their
minds
again
The
path
that
had
brought
them
the
hill
reappeared
the
north
ward
side
but
they
had
not
followed
far
before
they
became
aware
that
was
bending
steadily
the
right
Soon
began
descend
rapidly
and
they
guessed
that
must
actually
heading
towards
the
Withywindle
valley
not
all
the
150
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
direction
they
wished
take
After
some
discussion
they
decided
leave
this
misleading
path
and
strike
northward
for
although
they
had
not
been
able
see
from
the
hill
top
the
Road
must
lie
that
way
and
could
not
many
miles
off
Also
northward
and
the
left
the
path
the
land
seemed
drier
and
more
open
climbing
slopes
where
the
trees
were
thinner
and
pines
and
firs
replaced
the
oaks
and
ashes
and
other
strange
and
nameless
trees
the
denser
wood
first
their
choice
seemed
good
they
got
along
fair
speed
though
whenever
they
got
glimpse
the
sun
open
glade
they
seemed
unaccountably
have
veered
eastwards
But
after
time
the
trees
began
close
again
just
where
they
had
appeared
from
distance
thinner
and
less
tangled
Then
deep
folds
the
ground
were
dis
covered
unexpectedly
like
the
ruts
great
giant
wheels
wide
moats
and
sunken
roads
long
disused
and
choked
with
brambles
These
lay
usually
right
across
their
line
march
and
could
only
crossed
scrambling
down
and
out
again
which
was
troublesome
and
difficult
with
their
ponies
Each
time
they
climbed
down
they
found
the
hollow
filled
with
thick
bushes
and
matted
undergrowth
which
somehow
would
not
yield
the
left
but
only
gave
way
when
they
turned
the
right
and
they
had
some
distance
along
the
bottom
before
they
could
find
way
the
further
bank
Each
time
they
clambered
out
the
trees
seemed
deeper
and
darker
and
always
the
left
and
upwards
was
most
difficult
find
way
and
they
were
forced
the
right
and
downwards
After
hour
two
they
had
lost
all
clear
sense
direc
tion
though
they
knew
well
enough
that
they
had
long
ceased
northward
all
They
were
being
headed
off
and
were
simply
following
course
chosen
for
them
eastwards
and
southwards
into
the
heart
the
Forest
and
not
out
The
afternoon
was
wearing
away
when
they
scrambled
and
stumbled
into
fold
that
was
wider
and
deeper
than
any
they
had
yet
met
was
steep
and
overhung
that
proved
THE
OLD
FOREST
151
impossible
climb
out
again
either
forwards
back
wards
without
leaving
their
ponies
and
their
baggage
behind
All
they
could
was
follow
the
fold
downwards
The
ground
grew
soft
and
places
boggy
springs
appeared
the
banks
and
soon
they
found
themselves
following
brook
that
trickled
and
babbled
through
weedy
bed
Then
the
ground
began
fall
rapidly
and
the
brook
growing
strong
and
noisy
flowed
and
leaped
swiftly
downhill
They
were
deep
dim
lit
gully
over
arched
trees
high
above
them
After
stumbling
along
for
some
way
along
the
stream
they
came
quite
suddenly
out
the
gloom
through
gate
they
saw
the
sunlight
before
them
Coming
the
opening
they
found
that
they
had
made
their
way
down
through
cleft
high
steep
bank
almost
cliff
its
feet
was
wide
space
grass
and
reeds
and
the
distance
could
glimpsed
another
bank
almost
steep
golden
afternoon
late
sunshine
lay
warm
and
drowsy
upon
the
hidden
land
between
the
midst
there
wound
lazily
dark
river
brown
water
bordered
with
ancient
willows
arched
over
with
willows
blocked
with
fallen
willows
and
flecked
with
thousands
faded
willow
leaves
The
air
was
thick
with
them
fluttering
yellow
from
the
branches
for
there
was
warm
and
gentle
breeze
blowing
softly
the
valley
and
the
reeds
were
rustling
and
the
willow
boughs
were
creaking
Well
now
have
least
some
notion
where
are
said
Merry
have
come
almost
the
opposite
direction
which
intended
This
the
River
Withywindle
will
and
explore
passed
out
into
the
sunshine
and
disappeared
into
the
long
grasses
After
while
reappeared
and
reported
that
there
was
fairly
solid
ground
between
the
cliff
foot
and
the
river
some
places
firm
turf
went
down
the
water
edge
What
more
said
there
seems
something
like
footpath
winding
along
this
side
the
river
turn
left
and
follow
shall
bound
come
out
the
east
side
the
Forest
eventually
dare
say
said
Pippin
That
the
track
goes
152
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
far
and
does
not
simply
lead
into
bog
and
leave
there
Who
made
the
track
you
suppose
and
why
sure
was
not
for
our
benefit
getting
very
suspicious
this
Forest
and
everything
and
begin
believe
all
the
stories
about
And
have
you
any
idea
how
far
eastward
should
have
said
Merry
haven
don
know
the
least
how
far
down
the
Withywindle
are
who
could
possibly
come
here
often
enough
make
path
along
But
there
other
way
out
that
can
see
think
There
being
nothing
else
for
they
filed
out
and
Merry
led
them
the
path
that
had
discovered
Everywhere
the
reeds
and
grasses
were
lush
and
tall
places
far
above
their
heads
but
once
found
the
path
was
easy
follow
turned
and
twisted
picking
out
the
sounder
ground
among
the
bogs
and
pools
Here
and
there
passed
over
other
rills
running
down
gullies
into
the
Withywindle
out
the
higher
forest
lands
and
these
points
there
were
tree
trunks
bundles
brushwood
laid
carefully
across
The
hobbits
began
feel
very
hot
There
were
armies
flies
all
kinds
buzzing
round
their
ears
and
the
afternoon
sun
was
burning
their
backs
last
they
came
suddenly
into
thin
shade
great
grey
branches
reached
across
the
path
Each
step
forward
became
more
reluctant
than
the
last
Sleepiness
seemed
creeping
out
the
ground
and
their
legs
and
falling
softly
out
the
air
upon
their
heads
and
eyes
Frodo
felt
his
chin
down
and
his
head
nod
Just
front
him
Pippin
fell
forward
his
knees
Frodo
halted
good
heard
Merry
saying
Can
another
step
with
out
rest
Must
have
nap
cool
under
the
willows
Less
flies
Frodo
did
not
like
the
sound
this
Come
cried
can
have
nap
yet
must
get
clear
the
Forest
first
But
the
others
were
too
far
gone
care
Beside
them
Sam
stood
yawning
and
blinking
stupidly
Suddenly
Frodo
himself
felt
sleep
overwhelming
him
His
THE
OLD
FOREST
153
head
swam
There
now
seemed
hardly
sound
the
air
The
flies
had
stopped
buzzing
Only
gentle
noise
the
edge
hearing
soft
fluttering
song
half
whispered
seemed
stir
the
boughs
above
lifted
his
heavy
eyes
and
saw
leaning
over
him
huge
willow
tree
old
and
hoary
Enormous
looked
its
sprawling
branches
going
like
reaching
arms
with
many
long
fingered
hands
its
knotted
and
twisted
trunk
gaping
wide
fissures
that
creaked
faintly
the
boughs
moved
The
leaves
fluttering
against
the
bright
sky
dazzled
him
and
toppled
over
lying
where
fell
upon
the
grass
Merry
and
Pippin
dragged
themselves
forward
and
lay
down
with
their
backs
the
willow
trunk
Behind
them
the
great
cracks
gaped
wide
receive
them
the
tree
swayed
and
creaked
They
looked
the
grey
and
yellow
leaves
moving
softly
against
the
light
and
singing
They
shut
their
eyes
and
then
seemed
that
they
could
almost
hear
words
cool
words
saying
something
about
water
and
sleep
They
gave
themselves
the
spell
and
fell
fast
asleep
the
foot
the
great
grey
willow
Frodo
lay
for
while
fighting
with
the
sleep
that
was
over
powering
him
then
with
effort
struggled
his
feet
again
felt
compelling
desire
for
cool
water
Wait
for
Sam
stammered
Must
bathe
feet
minute
Half
dream
wandered
forward
the
riverward
side
the
tree
where
great
winding
roots
grew
out
into
the
stream
like
gnarled
dragonets
straining
down
drink
straddled
one
these
and
paddled
his
hot
feet
the
cool
brown
water
and
there
too
suddenly
fell
asleep
with
his
back
against
the
tree
Sam
sat
down
and
scratched
his
head
and
yawned
like
cavern
was
worried
The
afternoon
was
getting
late
and
thought
this
sudden
sleepiness
uncanny
There
more
behind
this
than
sun
and
warm
air
muttered
himself
don
like
this
great
big
tree
don
trust
Hark
singing
about
sleep
now
This
won
all

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
pulled
himself
his
feet
and
staggered
off
see
what
had
become
the
ponies
found
that
two
had
wandered
good
way
along
the
path
and
had
just
caught
them
and
brought
them
back
towards
the
others
when
heard
two
noises
one
loud
and
the
other
soft
but
very
clear
One
was
the
splash
something
heavy
falling
into
the
water
the
other
was
noise
like
the
snick
lock
when
door
quietly
closes
fast
rushed
back
the
bank
Frodo
was
the
water
close
the
edge
and
great
tree
root
seemed
over
him
and
holding
him
down
but
was
not
struggling
Sam
gripped
him
the
jacket
and
dragged
him
from
under
the
root
and
then
with
difficulty
hauled
him
the
bank
Almost
once
woke
and
coughed
and
spluttered
you
know
Sam
said
length
the
beastly
tree
threw
felt
The
big
root
just
twisted
round
and
tipped
You
were
dreaming
expect
Frodo
said
Sam
You
shouldn
sit
such
place
you
feel
sleepy
What
about
the
others
Frodo
asked
wonder
what
sort
dreams
they
are
having
They
went
round
the
other
side
the
tree
and
then
Sam
understood
the
click
that
had
heard
Pippin
had
vanished
The
crack
which
had
laid
himself
had
closed
together
that
not
chink
could
seen
Merry
was
trapped
another
crack
had
closed
about
his
waist
his
legs
lay
outside
but
the
rest
him
was
inside
dark
opening
the
edges
which
gripped
like
pair
pincers
Frodo
and
Sam
beat
first
upon
the
tree
trunk
where
Pippin
had
lain
They
then
struggled
frantically
pull
open
the
jaws
the
crack
that
held
poor
Merry
was
quite
useless
What
foul
thing
happen
cried
Frodo
wildly
Why
did
ever
come
into
this
dreadful
Forest
wish
were
all
back
Crickhollow
kicked
the
tree
with
all
his
strength
heed
less
his
own
feet
hardly
perceptible
shiver
ran
through
the
stem
and
into
the
branches
the
leaves
rustled
and
whispered
but
with
sound
now
faint
and
far
off
laughter

Frodo
asked
Sam
brought
little
hatchet
for

said
Frodo
That
wouldn

use
Wait

cried
Sam
struck
idea

Frodo
doubtfully

with

Sam
fiercely
don
let
them
have
down
have
gnaw
ran
the
ponies
and
before
long
came
back
with
two
tinder
boxes
and
hatchet
Quickly
they
gathered
dry
grass
and
leaves
and
bits
bark
and
made
pile
broken
twigs
and
chopped
sticks
These
they
heaped
against
the
trunk
the
far
side
the
tree
from
the
prisoners
soon
Sam
had
struck
spark
into
the
tinder
kindled
the
dry
grass
and
flurry
flame
and
smoke
went
The
twigs
crackled
Little
fingers
fire
licked
against
the
dry
scored
rind
the
ancient
tree
and
scorched
tremor
ran
through
the
whole
willow
The
leaves
seemed
hiss
above
their
heads
with
sound
pain
and
anger
loud
scream
came
from
Merry
and
from
far
inside
the
tree
they
heard
Pippin
give
muffled
yell
Put
out
Put
out
cried
Merry
squeeze
two
you
don
says
Who
What
shouted
Frodo
rushing
round
the
other
side
the
tree
Put
out
Put
out
begged
Merry
The
branches
the
willow
began
sway
violently
There
was
sound
wind
rising
and
spreading
outwards
the
branches
all
the
other
trees
round
about
though
they
had
dropped
stone
into
the
quiet
slumber
the
river
valley
and
set
ripples
anger
that
ran
out
over
the
whole
Forest
Sam
kicked
the
little
fire
and
stamped
out
the
sparks
But
Frodo
without
any
clear
idea
why
did
what
hoped
for
ran
along
the
path
crying
help
help
help
seemed
him
that
could
hardly
hear
the
sound
his
own
shrill
voice
was
156
THE

THE

blown
away
from
him
the
willow
wind
and
drowned
clamour
leaves
soon
the
words
left
his
mouth
felt
desperate
lost
and
witless
Suddenly
stopped
There
was
answer
thought
but
seemed
come
from
behind
him
away
down
the
path
further
back
the
Forest
turned
round
and
listened
and
soon
there
could
doubt
someone
was
singing
song
deep
glad
voice
was
singing
carelessly
and
happily
but
was
singing
nonsense
Hey

Half
hopeful
and
half
afraid
some
new
danger
Frodo
and
Sam
now
both
stood
still
Suddenly
out
long
string
nonsense
words
they
seemed
the
voice
rose
loud
and
clear
and
burst
into
this
song
Hey

Frodo
and
Sam
stood
enchanted
The
wind
puffed
out
The
leaves
hung
silently
again
stiff
branches
There
was
another
burst
song
and
then
suddenly
hopping
and
THE
OLD

157
dancing
along
the
path
there
appeared
above
the
reeds
old
battered
hat
with
tall
crown
and
long
blue
feather
stuck
the
band
With
another
hop
and
bound
there
came
into
view
man
seemed
any

was
too
large
and
heavy
for

not
quite
tall
enough
for

the
Big

though
made
noise
enough
for

stumping
along
with
great
yellow
boots
his
thick
legs
and
charging
through
grass
and
rushes
like
cow
going
down
drink
had
blue
coat
and
long
brown
beard
his
eyes
were
blue
and
bright
and
his
face
was

creased
into

wrinkles

his
hands
carried
large

Help

Frodo
and
Sam
running
towards
him
with
their
hands
stretched
out
Whoa
Whoa

there
cried
the
old
man
holding
one
hand
and
they
stopped
short
they
had
been
struck
stiff
Now

where
you
going
puffing
like

Tom

the

Old

Setting
down
his

carefully
the
grass
ran
the
tree
There
saw
Merry
feet
still
sticking
out
the
rest
had
already
been
drawn
further
inside
Tom
put
his
mouth
the
crack
and
began
singing
into
low
voice
They
could
not
catch
the
words
but
evidently
Merry
was
aroused
His
legs
began
luck
Tom
sprang
away
and
breaking
off
hanging
branch
smote
the
side
the
willow
with
You

said

Bombadil
talking
then
seized
Merry
feet
and
drew
him
out
the
suddenly
widening
crack
There
was
tearing
creak
and
the
other
crack
split
open
and
out
Pippin
sprang
had
been
lucked
Then
with
loud
snap
both
cracks
closed
fast
again
shudder
ran
through
the
tree
from
root
tip
and
complete
silence
fell
Thank
you
said
the
hobbits
one
after
the
other
Tom
Bombadil
burst
out
laughing
Well
little
fellows
said
stooping
that
peered
into
their
faces
You

You

With
that
picked
his
lilies
and
then
with
beckoning
wave
his
hand
went
hopping
and
dancing
along
the
path
eastward
still
singing
loudly
and
nonsensically
Too
surprised
and
too
relieved
talk
the
hobbits
followed
after
him
fast
they
could
But
that
was
not
fast
enough
Tom
soon
disappeared
front
them
and
the
noise
his
singing
got
fainter
and
further
away
Suddenly
his
voice
came
floating
back
them
loud
halloo
Hop

After
that
the
hobbits
heard
more
Almost
once
the
sun
seemed
sink
into
the
trees
behind
them
They
thought
the
slanting
light
evening
glittering
the
Brandywine
River
and
the
windows
Bucklebury
beginning
gleam
THE
OLD
FOREST
159
with
hundreds
lights
Great
shadows
fell
across
them
trunks
and
branches
trees
hung
dark
and
threatening
over
the
path
White
mists
began
rise
and
curl
the
surface
the
river
and
stray
about
the
roots
the
trees
upon
its
borders
Out
the
very
ground
their
feet
shadowy
steam
arose
and
mingled
with
the
swiftly
falling
dusk
became
difficult
follow
the
path
and
they
were
very
tired
Their
legs
seemed
leaden
Strange
furtive
noises
ran
among
the
bushes
and
reeds
either
side
them
and
they
looked
the
pale
sky
they
caught
sight
queer
gnarled
and
knobbly
faces
that
gloomed
dark
against
the
twilight
and
leered
down
them
from
the
high
bank
and
the
edges
the
wood
They
began
feel
that
all
this
country
was
unreal
and
that
they
were
stumbling
through
ominous
dream
that
led
awakening
Just
they
felt
their
feet
slowing
down
standstill
they
noticed
that
the
ground
was
gently
rising
The
water
began
murmur
the
darkness
they
caught
the
white
glimmer
foam
where
the
river
flowed
over
short
fall
Then
sud
denly
the
trees
came
end
and
the
mists
were
left
behind
They
stepped
out
from
the
Forest
and
found
wide
sweep
grass
welling
before
them
The
river
now
small
and
swift
was
leaping
merrily
down
meet
them
glinting
here
and
there
the
light
the
stars
which
were
already
shining
the
sky
The
grass
under
their
feet
was
smooth
and
short
had
been
mown
shaven
The
eaves
the
Forest
behind
were
clipped
and
trim
hedge
The
path
was
now
plain
before
them
well
tended
and
bordered
with
stone
wound
the
top
grassy
knoll
now
grey
under
the
pale
starry
night
and
there
still
high
above
them
further
slope
they
saw
the
twinkling
lights
house
Down
again
the
path
went
and
then
again
long
smooth
hillside
turf
towards
the
light
Suddenly
wide
yellow
beam
flowed
out
brightly
from
door
that
was
opened
There
was
Tom
Bombadil
house
before
them
down
under
hill
Behind
steep
shoulder
the
land
lay
grey
and
bare
and
i6o
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
beyond
that
the
dark
shapes
the
Barrow
downs
stalked
away
into
the
eastern
night
They
all
hurried
forward
hobbits
and
ponies
Already
half
their
weariness
and
all
their
fears
had
fallen
from
them
Hey
Come
merry

rolled
out
the
song
greet
them
Hey

Hop

Hobbits

all

Now

Let

Then
another
clear
voice
young
and
ancient
Spring
like
the
song
glad
water
flowing
down
into
the
night
from
bright
morning
the
hills
came
falling
like
silver
meet
them
Now
let
the
song
begin
Let
sing
together
sun

and

rain
and

Light
the

Wind
the

Reeds
the

And
with
that
song
the
hobbits
stood
upon
the
threshold
and
golden
light
was
all
about
them
Chapter
THE
HOUSE
TOM
BOMBADIL
The
four
hobbits
stepped
over
the
wide
stone
threshold
and
stood
still
blinking
They
were
long
low
room
filled
with
the
light
lamps
swinging
from
the
beams
the
roof
and
the
table
dark
polished
wood
stood
many
candles
tall
and
yellow
burning
brightly
chair
the
far
side
the
room
facing
the
outer
door
sat
woman
Her
long
yellow
hair
rippled
down
her
shoulders
her
gown
was
green
green
young
reeds
shot
with
silver
like
beads
dew
and
her
belt
was
gold
shaped
like
chain
flag
lilies
set
with
the
pale
blue
eyes
forget
nots
About
her
feet
wide
vessels
green
and
brown
earthenware
white
water
lilies
were
floating
that
she
seemed
enthroned
the
midst
pool
Enter
good
guests
she
said
and
she
spoke
they
knew
that
was
her
clear
voice
they
had
heard
singing
They
came
few
timid
steps
further
into
the
room
and
began
bow
low
feeling
strangely
surprised
and
awkward
like
folk

answered
fair
young
elf
queen
clad
living
flowers
But
before
they
could
say
anything
she
sprang
lightly
and
over
the
lily
bowls
and
ran
laughing
towards
them
and
she
ran
her
gown
rustled
softly
like
the
wind
the
flowering

Come
dear
folk
she
said
taking
Frodo
the
hand
Laugh
and
merry
Goldberry
daughter
the
River
Then
lightly
she
passed
them
and
closing
the
door
she
turned
her
back
with
her
white
arms
spread
out
across
Let
shut
out
the
night
she
said
For
you
are
still
afraid
perhaps
mist
and
tree
shadows
and
deep
water
and
untame
things
Fear
nothing
For
tonight
you
are

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
The
hobbits
looked
her
wonder
and
she
looked
each
them
and
smiled
Fair
lady
Goldberry
said
Frodo
last
feeling
his
heart
moved
with
joy
that
did
not
understand
stood
had
times
stood
enchanted
fair
elven
voices
but
the
spell
that
was
now
laid
upon
him
was
different
less
keen
and
lofty
was
the
delight
but
deeper
and
nearer
mortal
heart
marvellous
and
yet
not
strange
Fair
lady
Goldberry
said
again
Now
the
joy
that
was
hidden
the
songs
heard
made
plain
slender
willow
wand
clearer
than
clear
water
reed
the
living
pool
Fair
River
daughter
spring
time
and
summer
time
and
spring
again
after
wind
the
waterfall
and
the
leaves
laughter
Suddenly
stopped
and
stammered
overcome
with
sur
prise
hear
himself
saying
such
things
But
Goldberry
laughed
Welcome
she
said
had
not
heard
that
folk
the
Shire
were
sweet
tongued
But
see
that
you
are
Elf
friend
the
light
your
eyes
and
the
ring
your
voice
tells
This
merry
meeting
Sit
now
and
wait
for
the
Master
the
house
will
not
long
tending
your
Ured
beasts
The
hobbits
sat
down
gladly
low
rush
seated
chairs
while
Goldberry
busied
herself
about
the
table
and
their
eyes
followed
her
for
the
slender
grace
her
movement
filled
them
with
quiet
delight
From
somewhere
behind
the
house
came
the
sound
singing
Every
now
and
again
they
caught
among
many
derry
dol
and
merry
dol
and
ring
ding
dillo
the
repeated
words
Old

Bright

Frodo
again
after

said
Goldberry
staying
her
swift
movements
and
smiling
Frodo
looked
her
questioningly
you
have
seen
him
she
said
answer
his
look
the
Master
wood
water
and

Then
all
this
strange
land
belongs
him
indeed
she
answered
and
her
smile
faded
That
would
indeed
burden
she
added
low
voice
herself
The
trees
and
the
grasses
and
all
things
growing
living
the

belong
each
themselves
Tom

the

door
opened
and
came
Tom
Bombadil
had
now
hat
and
his
thick
brown
hair
was
crowned
with
autumn
leaves
laughed
and
going
Goldberry
took
her
hand
Here
pretty
lady
said
bowing
the
hobbits
Here
Goldberry
clothed
all
silver
green
with
flowers
her
girdle
the
table
laden
see
yellow
cream
and
honeycomb
and
white
bread
and
butter
milk

and
green
herbs
and
ripe
berries
gathered
that
enough
for
the
supper
ready
said
Goldberry
but
the
guests
perhaps
are
not
Tom
clapped
his
hands
and
cried
Tom
Tom
your
guests
are
tired
and
you
had
near
forgotten
Come
now
merry
friends
and
Tom
will
refresh
you
You
shall
clean
grimy
hands
and
wash
your
weary
faces
cast
off
your
muddy
cloaks
and
comb
out
your
tangles
opened
the
door
and
they
followed
him
down
short
passage
and
round
sharp
turn
They
came
low
room
with
sloping
roof
penthouse
seemed
built
the
north
end
the
house
Its
walls
were
clean
stone
but
they
were
mostly
covered
with
green
hanging
mats
and
yellow
curtains
The
floor
was
flagged
and
strewn
with
fresh
green
rushes
There
were
four
deep
mattresses
each
piled
with
white
blankets
laid
the
floor
along
one
side
Against
the
opposite
wall
was
long
bench
laden
with
wide
earthenware
164
the
fellowship
the
ring
basins
and
beside
stood
brown
ewers
filled
with
water
some
cold
some
steaming
hot
There
were
soft
green
slippers
set
ready
beside
each
bed
Before
long
washed
and
refreshed
the
hobbits
were
seated
the
table
two
each
side
while
either
end
sat
Gold
berry
and
the
Master
was
long
and
merry
meal
Though
the
hobbits
ate
only
famished
hobbits
can
eat
there
was
lack
The
drink
their
drinking
bowls
seemed
clear
cold
water
yet
went
their
hearts
like
wine
and
set
free
their
voices
The
guests
became
suddenly
aware
that
they
were
singing
merrily
was
easier
and
more
natural
than
talking
last
Tom
and
Goldberry
rose
and
cleared
the
table
swiftly
The
guests
were
commanded
sit
quiet
and
were
set
chairs
each
with
footstool
his
tired
feet
There
was
fire
the
wide
hearth
before
them
and
was
burning
with
sweet
smell
were
built
apple
wood
When
everything
was
set
order
all
the
lights
the
room
were
put
out
except
one
lamp
and
pair
candles
each
end
the
chimney
shelf
Then
Goldberry
came
and
stood
before
them
holding
candle
and
she
wished
them
each
good
night
and
deep
sleep
Have
peace
now
she
said
until
the
morning
Heed
nightly
noises
For
nothing
passes
door
and
window
here
save
moonlight
and
starlight
and
the
wind
off
the
hill
top
Good
night
She
passed
out
the
room
with
glimmer
and
rustle
The
sound
her
footsteps
was
like
stream
falling
gently
away
downhill
over
cool
stones
the
quiet
night
Tom
sat
while
beside
them
silence
while
each
them
tried
muster
the
courage
ask
one
the
many
questions
had
meant
ask
supper
Sleep
gathered
their
eyelids
last
Frodo
spoke
Did
you
hear
calling
Master
was
just
chance
that
brought
you
that
moment
Tom
stirred
like

shaken
out

But

Tom

Goldberry
sitting
the

Sweet
was
her

then
and
her
heart
was
beating
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
them
with
sudden
glint
blue
And
that
proved

fell
silent
again
but
Frodo
could
not
help
asking
one
more
question
the
one
most
desired
have
answered
Tell
Master
said
about
the
Willow

What

Not

Not

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
That
right
said
the
old
man
Now
the
time
for
resting
Some
things
are
ill
hear
when
the
world
shadow
Sleep
till
the
morning
light
rest
the
pillow
Heed
nightly
noise
Fear
grey
willow
And
with
that
took
down
the
lamp
and
blew
out
and
grasping
candle
either
hand
led
them
out
the
room
Their
mattresses
and
pillows
were
soft
down
and
the
blankets
were
white
wool
They
had
hardly
laid
themselves
the
deep
beds
and
drawn
the
light
covers
over
them
before
they
were
asleep
the
dead
night
Frodo
lay
dream
without
light
Then
saw
the
young
moon
rising
under
its
thin
light
there
loomed
before
him
black
wall
rock
pierced
dark
arch
like
great
gate
seemed
Frodo
that
was
lifted
and
passing
over
saw
that
the
rock
wall
was
circle
hills
and
that
within
was
plain
and
the
midst
the
plain
stood
pinnacle
stone
like
vast
tower
but
not
made
hands
its
top
stood
the
figure
man
The
moon
rose
seemed
hang
for
moment
above
his
head
and
glistened
his
white
hair
the
wind
stirred
from
the
dark
plain
below
came
the
crying
fell
voices
and
the
howl
ing
many
wolves
Suddenly
shadow
like
the
shape
great
wings
passed
across
the
moon
The
figure
lifted
his
arms
and
light
flashed
from
the
staff
that
wielded
mighty
eagle
swept
down
and
bore
him
away
The
voices
wailed
and
the
wolves
yammered
There
was
noise
like
strong
wind
blowing
and
was
borne
the
sound
hoofs
galloping
galloping
galloping
from
the
East
Black
Riders
thought
Frodo
wakened
with
the
sound
the
hoofs
still
echoing
his
mind
wondered
would
ever
again
have
the
courage
leave
the
safety
these
stone
walls
lay
motionless
still
listening
but
all
was
now
silent
and
last
turned
and
fell
asleep
again
wandered
into
some
other
unremembered
dream
his
side
Pippin
lay
dreaming
pleasantly
but
change
came
over
his
dreams
and
turned
and
groaned
Suddenly
THE
HOUSE
TOM
BOMBADIL
167
woke
thought
had
waked
and
yet
still
heard
the
darkness
the
sound
that
had
disturbed
his
dream
tip
tap
squeak
the
noise
was
like
branches
fretting
the
wind
twig
fingers
scraping
wall
and
window
creak
creak
creak
wondered
there
were
willow
trees
close
the
house
and
then
suddenly
had
dreadful
feeling
that
was
not
ordinary
house
all
but
inside
the
willow
and
listening
that
horrible
dry
creaking
voice
laughing
him
again
sat
and
felt
the
soft
pillows
yield
his
hands
and
lay
down
again
relieved
seemed
hear
the
echo
words
his
ears
Fear
nothing
Have
peace
until
the
morning
Heed
nightly
noises
Then
went
sleep
again
was
the
sound
water
that
Merry
heard
falling
into
his
quiet
sleep
water
streaming
down
gently
and
then
spreading
spreading
irresistibly
all
round
the
house
into
dark
shoreless
pool
gurgled
under
the
walls
and
was
rising
slowly
but
surely
shall
drowned
thought
will
find
its
way
and
then
shall
drown
felt
that
was
lying
soft
slimy
bog
and
springing
set
his
foot
the
corner
cold
hard
flagstone
Then
remembered
where
was
and
lay
down
again
seemed
hear
remember
hearing
Nothing
passes
doors
windows
save
moonlight
and
star
light
and
the
wind
off
the
hill
top
little
breath
sweet
air
moved
the
curtain
breathed
deep
and
fell
asleep
again
far
could
remember
Sam
slept
through
the
night
deep
content
logs
are
contented
They
woke
all
four
once
the
morning
light
Tom
was
moving
about
the
room
whistling
like
starling
When
heard
them
stir
clapped
his
hands
and
cried
Hey
Come
merry
dol
derry
dol
hearties
drew
back
the
yellow
curtains
and
the
hobbits
saw
that
these
had
covered
the
windows
either
end
the
room
one
looking
east
and
the
other
looking
west
They
leapt
refreshed
Frodo
ran
the
eastern
window
and
found
himself
looking
into
kitchen
garden
grey
with
dew
had
half
expected
see
turf
right
the

THE

THE
RING
turf
all
pocked
with
hoof
prints
Actually
his
view
was
screened
tall
line
beans
poles
but
above
and
far
beyond
them
the
grey
top
the
hill
loomed
against
the
sunrise
was
pale
morning
the
East
behind
long
clouds
like
lines
soiled
wool
stained
red
the
edges
lay
glimmer
ing
deeps
yellow
The
sky
spoke
rain
come
but
the
light
was
broadening
quickly
and
the
red
flowers
the
beans
began
glow
against
the
wet
green
leaves
Pippin
looked
out
the
western
window
down
into
pool
mist
The
Forest
was
hidden
under
fog
was
like
looking
down
sloping
cloud
roof
from
above
There
was
fold
channel
where
the
mist
was
broken
into
many
plumes
and
billows
the
valley
the
Withywindle
The
stream
ran
down
the
hill
the
left
and
vanished
into
the
white
shadows
Near
hand
was
flower
garden
and
clipped
hedge
silver
netted
and
beyond
that
grey
shaven
grass
pale
with
dew
drops
There
was
willow
tree
seen
Good

cried
Tom
opening
the
eastern
window
wide
cool
air
flowed
had
rainy
smell
Sun
won
show
her

much
today
thinking
have

since
the

Needless
say
not
that
Tom
threat
sounded
very
serious
the
hobbits
came
soon
and
left
the
table
late
and
only
when
was
beginning
look
rather
empty
Neither
Tom
nor
Goldberry
were
there
Tom
could
heard
about
the
house
clattering
the
kitchen
and
and
down
the
stairs
and
singing
here
and
there
outside
The

looked
THE

westward
over
the
mist
clouded
valley
and
the
window
was
open
Water
dripped
down
from
the
thatched
eaves
above
Before
they
had
finished
breakfast
the
clouds
had
joined
into
unbroken
roof
and
straight
grey
rain
came
softly
and
steadily
down
Behind
its
deep
curtain
the
Forest
was
com
pletely
veiled
they
looked
out
the
window
there
came
falling
gently
was
flowing
down
the
rain
out
the
sky
the
clear
voice
Goldberry
singing
above
them
They
could
hear
few
words
but
seemed
plain
them
that
the
song
was
rain
song
sweet
showers
dry
hills
that
told
the
tale
river
from
the
spring
the
highlands
the
Sea
far
below
The
hobbits
listened
with
delight
and
Frodo
was
glad
his
heart
and
blessed
the
kindly
weather
because
delayed
them
from
departing
The
thought
going
had
been
heavy
upon
him
from
the
moment
awoke
but
guessed
now
that
they
would
not
further
that
day
The
upper
wind
settled
the
West
and
deeper
and
wetter
clouds
rolled
spill
their
laden
rain
the
bare
heads
the
Downs
Nothing
could
seen
all
round
the
house
but
falling
water
Frodo
stood
near
the
open
door
and
watched
the
white
chalky
path
turn
into
little
river
milk
and
bubbling
away
down
into
the
valley
Tom
Bombadil
came
trotting
round
the
corner
the
house
waving
his
arms
was
warding
off
the
rain
and
indeed
when
sprang
over
the
threshold
seemed
quite
dry
except
for
his
boots
These
took
off
and
put
the
chimney
corner
Then
sat
the
largest
chair
and
called
the
hobbits
gather
round
him
This
Goldberry
washing
day
said
and
her
autumn
cleaning
Too
wet
for
hobbit
folk
let
them
rest
while
they
are
able
good
day
for
long
tales
for
questions
and
for
answers
Tom
will
start
the
talking
then
told
them
many
remarkable
stories
sometimes
half
speaking

sometimes
looking
them
suddenly
with
bright
blue
eye
under
his
deep
brows

would
turn

his

they

the

all

were

Moving
constantly
and

Tom
words
laid
bare
the
hearts
trees
and
their
thoughts
which
were
often
dark
and
strange
and
filled
with
hatred
things
that
free
upon
the
earth
gnawing
biting
breaking
hacking
burning
destroyers
and
usurpers
was
not
called
the
Old
Forest
without

for
was
indeed
ancient
survivor
vast
forgotten
woods
and
there
lived
yet
ageing
quicker
than
the
hills
the
fathers
the
fathers
trees
remembering
times
when
they
were
lords
The
countless
years
had
filled
them
with
pride
and
rooted
wisdom
and
with
malice
But
none
were
more
dangerous
than
the
Great
Willow
his
heart
was
rotten
but
his
strength
was
green
and
was
cunning
and
master
winds
and
his
song
and
thought
ran
through
the
woods
both
sides
the
river
His
grey
thirsty
spirit
drew
power
out
the
earth
and
spread
like
fine
root
threads
the
ground
and
invisible
twig
fingers
the
air
till
had
under
its
dominion
nearly
all
the
trees
the
Forest
from
the
Hedge
the
Downs
Suddenly
Tom
talk
left
the
woods
and
went
leaping
the
young
stream
over
bubbling
waterfalls
over
pebbles
and
worn
rocks
and
among
small
flowers
close
grass
and
wet
crannies
wandering
last
the
Downs
They
heard
the
Great
Barrows
and
the
green
mounds
and
the
stone
rings
upon
the
hills
and
the
hollows
among
the
hills
Sheep
were
bleating
flocks
Green
walls
and
white
walls
rose
There
were
fortresses
the
heights
Kings
little

THE

fought
together
and
the
young
Sun
shone
like
fire
the
red
metal
their
new
and
greedy
swords
There
was
victory
and
defeat
and
towers
fell
fortresses
were
burned
and
flames
went
into
the
sky
Gold
was
piled
the
biers
dead
kings
and
queens
and
mounds
covered
them
and
the
stone
doors
were
shut
and
the
grass
grew
over
all
Sheep
walked
for
while
biting
the
grass
but
soon
the
hills
were
empty
again
shadow
came
out
dark
places
far
away
and
the
bones
were
stirred
the
mounds
Barrow
wights
walked
the
hollow
places
with
clinic
rings
cold
fingers
and
gold
chains
the
wind
Stone
rings
grinned
out
the
ground
like
broken
teeth
the
moonlight
The
hobbits
shuddered
Even
the
Shire
the
rumour
the
Barrow
wights
the
Barrow
downs
beyond
the
Forest
had
been
heard
But
was
not
tale
that
any
hobbit
liked
listen
even
comfortable
fireside
far
away
These
four
now
suddenly
remembered
what
the
joy
this
house
had
driven
from
their
minds
the
house
Tom
Bombadil
nestled
under
the
very
shoulder
those
dreaded
hills
They
lost
the
thread
his
tale
and
shifted
uneasily
looking
aside
one
another
When
they
caught
his
words
again
they
found
that
had
now
wandered
into
strange
regions
beyond
their
memory
and
beyond
their
waking
thought
into
times
when
the
world
was
wider
and
the
seas
flowed
straight
the
western
Shore
and
still
and
back
Tom
went
singing
out
into
ancient
starlight
when
only
the
Elf
sires
were
awake
Then
suddenly
stopped
and
they
saw
that
nodded
was
falling
asleep
The
hobbits
sat
still
before
him
enchanted
and
seemed
under
the
spell
his
words
the
wind
had
gone
and
the
clouds
had
dried
and
the
day
had
been
withdrawn
and
darkness
had
come
from
East
and
West
and
all
the
sky
was
filled
with
the
light
white
stars
Whether
the
morning
and
evening
one
day
many
days
had
passed
Frodo
could
not
tell
did
not
feel
either
hungry
tired
only
filled
with
wonder
The
stars
shone
through
the
window
and
the
silence
the
heavens
seemed
172
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
round
him
spoke
last
out
his
wonder
and
sudden
fear
that
silence
Who
are
you
Master
asked
what
said
Tom
sitting
and
his
eyes
glinting
the
gloom
Don
you
know
name
yet
That
the
only
answer
Tell
who
are
you
alone
yourself
and
nameless
But
you
are
young
and
old
Eldest
that
what
Mark
words
friends
Tom
was
here
before
the
river
and
the
trees
Tom
remembers
the
first
raindrop
and
the
first
acorn
made
paths
before
the
Big
People
and
saw
the
little
People
arriving
was
here
before
the
Kings
and
the
graves
and
the
Barrow
wights
When
the
Elves
passed
west
ward
Tom
was
here
already
before
the
seas
were
bent
knew
the
dark
under
the
stars
when
was
fearless
before
the
Dark
Lord
came
from
Outside
shadow
seemed
pass
the
window
and
the
hobbits
glanced
hastily
through
the
panes
When
they
turned
again
Goldberry
stood
the
door
behind
framed
light
She
held
candle
shielding
its
flame
from
the
draught
with
her
hand
and
the
light
flowed
through
like
sunlight
through
white
shell
The
rain
has
ended
she
said
and
new
waters
are
running
downhill
under
the
stars
Let
now
laugh
and
glad
And
let
have
food
and
drink
cried
Tom
Long
tales
are
thirsty
And
long
listening
hungry
work
morning
noon
and
evening
With
that
jumped
out
his
chair
and
with
bound
took
candle
from
the
chimney
shelf
and
lit
the
flame
that
Goldberry
held
then
danced
about
the
table
Suddenly
hopped
through
the
door
and
dis
appeared
Quickly
returned
bearing
large
and
laden
tray
Then
Tom
and
Goldberry
set
the
table
and
the
hobbits
sat
half
wonder
and
half
laughter
fair
was
the
grace
Gold
berry
and
merry
and
odd
the
caperings
Tom
Yet
some
fashion
they
seemed
weave
single
dance
neither
hindering
the
other
and
out
the
room
and
round
about
the
table
and
with
great
speed
food
and
vessels
and
lights
THE
HOUSE
TOM
BOMBADIL
were
set
order
The
boards
blazed
with
candles
white
and
yellow
Tom
bowed
his
guests
Supper
ready
said
Goldberry
and
now
the
hobbits
saw
that
she
was
clothed
all
silver
with
white
girdle
and
her
shoes
were
like
fishes
mail
But
Tom
was
all
clean
blue
blue
rain
washed
forget
nots
and
had
green
stockings
was
supper
even
better
than
before
The
hobbits
under
the
spell
Tom
words
may
have
missed
one
meal
many
but
when
the
food
was
before
them
seemed
least
week
since
they
had
eaten
They
did
not
sing
even
speak
much
for
while
and
paid
close
attention
business
But
after
time
their
hearts
and
spirits
rose
high
again
and
their
voices
rang
out
mirth
and
laughter
After
they
had
eaten
Goldberry
sang
many
songs
for
them
songs
that
began
merrily
the
hills
and
fell
softly
down
into
silence
and
the
silences
they
saw
their
minds
pools
and
waters
wider
than
any
they
had
known
and
looking
into
them
they
saw
the
sky
below
them
and
the
stars
like
jewels
the
depths
Then
once
more
she
wished
them
each
good
night
and
left
them
the
fireside
But
Tom
now
seemed
wide
awake
and
plied
them
with
questions
appeared
already
know
much
about
them
and
all
their
families
and
indeed
know
much
all
the
history
and
doings
the
Shire
down
from
days
hardly
remembered
among
the
hobbits
themselves
longer
surprised
them
but
made
secret
that
owed
his
recent
knowledge
largely
Farmer
Maggot
whom
seemed
regard
person
more
importance
than
they
had
imagined
There
earth
under
his
old
feet
and
clay
his
fingers
wisdom
his
bones
and
both
his
eyes
are
open
said
Tom
was
also
clear
that
Tom
had
dealings
with
the
Elves
and
seemed
that
some
fashion
news
had
reached
him
from
Gildor
concerning
the
flight
Frodo
Indeed
much
did
Tom
know
and
cunning
was
his
questioning
that
Frodo
found
himself
telling
him
more
about
Bilbo
and
his
own
hopes
and
fears
than
had
told
before
174
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
even
Gandalf
Tom
wagged
his
head
and
down
and
there
was
glint
his
eyes
when
heard
the
Riders
Show
the
precious
Ring
said
suddenly
the
midst
the
story
and
Frodo
his
own
astonishment
drew
out
the
chain
from
his
pocket
and
unfastening
the
Ring
handed
once
Tom
seemed
grow
larger
lay
for
moment
his
big
brown
skinned
hand
Then
suddenly
put
his
eye
and
laughed
For
second
the
hobbits
had
vision
both
comical
and
alarming
his
bright
blue
eye
gleaming
through
circle
gold
Then
Tom
put
the
Ring
round
the
end
his
little
finger
and
held
the
candlelight
For
moment
the
hobbits
noticed
nothing
strange
about
this
Then
they
gasped
There
was
sign
Tom
disappearing
Tom
laughed
again
and
then
spun
the
Ring
the
air
and
vanished
with
flash
Frodo
gave
cry
and
Tom
leaned
forward
and
handed
back
him
with
smile
Frodo
looked
closely
and
rather
suspiciously
like
one
who
has
lent
trinket
juggler
was
the
same
Ring
looked
the
same
and
weighed
the
same
for
that
Ring
had
always
seemed
Frodo
weigh
strangely
heavy
the
hand
But
something
prompted
him
make
sure
was
perhaps
trifle
annoyed
with
Tom
for
seeming
make
light
what
even
Gandalf
thought
perilously
important
waited
for
opportunity
when
the
talk
was
going
again
and
Tom
was
telling
absurd
story
about
badgers
and
their
queer
ways
then
slipped
the
Ring
Merry
turned
towards
him
say
something
and
gave
start
and
checked
exclamation
Frodo
was
delighted
way
was
his
own
ring
all
right
for
Merry
was
staring
blankly
his
chair
and
obviously
could
not
see
him
got
and
crept
quietly
away
from
the
fireside
towards
the
outer
door
Hey
there
cried
Tom
glancing
towards
him
with
most
seeing
look
his
shining
eyes
Hey
Come
Frodo
there
Where

the

and
keep

Frodo
laughed
trying
feel
pleased
and
taking
off
the
Ring
came
and
sat
down
again
Tom
now
told
them
that
reckoned
the
Sun
would
shine
tomorrow
and
would

But
they
would

When
they
had
sung
this
altogether
after
him
clapped
them
each
the
shoulder
with
laugh
and
taking
candles
led
them
back
their

Chapter
FOG
THE
BARROW
DOWNS
That
night
they
heard
noises
But
either
his
dreams
out
them
could
not
tell
which
Frodo
heard
sweet
singing
running
his
mind
song
that
seemed
come
like
pale
light
behind
grey
rain
curtain
and
growing
stronger
turn
the
veil
all
glass
and
silver
until
last
was
rolled
back
and
far
green
country
opened
before
him
under
swift
sunrise
The
vision
melted
into
waking
and
there
was
Tom
whist
ling
like
tree
full
birds
and
the
sun
was
already
slanting
down
the
hill
and
through
the
open
window
Outside
every
thing
was
green
and
pale
gold
After
breakfast
which
they
again
ate
alone
they
made
ready
say
farewell
nearly
heavy
heart
was
possible
such
morning
cool
bright
and
clean
under
washed
autumn
sky
thin
blue
The
air
came
fresh
from
the
North
west
Their
quiet
ponies
were
almost
frisky
sniffing
and
moving
restlessly
Tom
came
out
the
house
and
waved
his
hat
and
danced
upon
the
doorstep
bidding
the
hobbits
get
and
off
and
with
good
speed
They
rode
off
along
path
that
wound
away
from
behind
the
house
and
went
slanting
towards
the
north
end
the
hill
brow
under
which
sheltered
They
had
just
dismounted
lead
their
ponies
the
last
steep
slope
when
suddenly
Frodo
stopped
Goldberry
cried
fair
lady
clad
all
silver
green
have
never
said
farewell
her
nor
seen
her
since
the
evening
was
distressed
that
turned
back
but
that
moment
clear
call
came
rippling
down
There
the
hill
brow
she
stood
beckoning
them
her
hair
was
flying
loose
and
caught
the
sun
shone

light
like
the
glint
water
dewy
grass
flashed
from
under
her
feet
she
danced
They
hastened
the
last
slope
and
stood
breathless
beside
her
They
bowed
but
with
wave
her
arm
she
bade
them
look
round
and
they
looked
out
from
the
hill
top
over
lands
under
the
morning
was
now
clear
and
far
seen
had
been
veiled
and
misty
when
they
stood
upon
the
knoll
the

could

rising

and

faded
into

Eastward

spoke

the

They
took
deep
draught

and
felt
that

and
few
stout

bear
them

And

THE

THE
RING
down
the
gentle
slope
behind
the
hill
Tom
Bombadil
house
and
the
valley
and
the
Forest
were
lost
view
The
air
grew
warmer
between
the
green
walls
hillside
and
hillside
and
the
scent
turf
rose
strong
and
sweet
they
breathed
Turning
back
when
they
reached
the
bottom
the
green
hollow
they
saw
Goldberry
now
small
and
slender
like
sunlit
flower
against
the
sky
she
was
standing
still
watching
them
and
her
hands
were
stretched
out
towards
them
they
looked
she
gave
clear
call
and
lifting
her
hand
she
turned
and
vanished
behind
the
hill
Their
way
wound
along
the
floor
the
hollow
and
round
the
green
feet
steep
hill
into
another
deeper
and
broader
valley
and
then
over
the
shoulders
further
hills
and
down
their
long
limbs
and
their
smooth
sides
again
new
hill
tops
and
down
into
new
valleys
There
was
tree
nor
any
visible
water
was
country
grass
and
short
springy
turf
silent
except
for
the
whisper
the
air
over
the
edges
the
land
and
high
lonely
cries
strange
birds
they
journeyed
the
sun
mounted
and
grew
hot
Each
time
they
climbed
ridge
the
breeze
seemed
have
grown
less
When
they
caught
glimpse
the
country
westward
the
distant
Forest
seemed
smoking
the
fallen
rain
was
steaming
again
from
leaf
and
root
and
mould
shadow
now
lay
round
the
edge
sight
dark
haze
above
which
the
upper
sky
was
like
blue
cap
hot
and
heavy
About
mid
day
they
came
hill
whose
top
was
wide
and
flattened
like
shallow
saucer
with
green
mounded
rim
Inside
there
was
air
stirring
and
the
sky
seemed
near
their
heads
They
rode
across
and
looked
northwards
Then
their
hearts
rose
for
seemed
plain

they

already
than

Certainly
the

tances

all
become

and

there
could
doubt
that
the
Downs
were

long

That

said
Merry
and
that
must
mark
the
Road
All
along
for
many
leagues
east
the
Bridge
there
are
trees
growing
Some
say
they
were
planted
the
old

Splendid

Frodo
make

going
this

done
this
morning
shall
have
left
the
Downs
before
the
Sun
sets
and
jogging
search
camping
place
But
even
spoke
turned
his
glance
eastwards
and
saw
that
that
side
the
hills
were
higher
and
looked
down
upon
them
and
all
those
hills
were
crowned
with
green
mounds
and
some
were
standing
stones
pointing
upwards
like
jagged
teeth
out
green
gums
That
view
was
somehow
disquieting
they
turned
from
the
sight
and
went
down
into
the
hollow
circle
the
midst
there
stood
single
stone
standing
tall
under
the
sun
above
and
this
hour
casting
shadow
was
shapeless
and
yet
significant
like
landmark
guarding
finger
more
like
warning
But
they
were
now
hungry
and
the
sun
was
still
the
fearless
noon
they
set
their
backs
against
the
east
side
the
stone
was
cool
the
sun
had
had
power
warm
but
that
time
this
seemed
pleasant
There
they
took
food
and
drink
and
made
good
noon
meal
under
the
open
sky
anyone
could
wish
for
the
food
came
from
down
under
Hill
Tom
had
provided
them
with
plenty
for
the
comfort
the
day
Their
ponies
unburdened
strayed
upon
the
grass
Riding
over
the
hills
and
eating
their
fill
the
warm
sun
and
the
scent
turf
lying
little
too
long
stretching
out
their
legs
and
looking
the
sky
above
their
noses
these
things
are
perhaps
enough
explain
what
happened
How
ever
that
may
they
woke
suddenly
and
uncomfortably
from
sleep
they
had
never
meant
take
The
standing
stone
was
cold
and
cast
long
pale
shadow
that
stretched
eastward
over
them
The
sun
pale
and
watery
yellow
was
gleaming
through
the
mist
just
above
the
west
wall
the
hollow
which
they
lay

wall
the
fog
was
thick
cold
and
white
The
air
was
silent
heavy
and
chill
Their
ponies
were
standing
crowded
together
with
their
heads
down
The
hobbits
sprang
their
feet
alarm
and
ran
the
western
rim
They
found
that
they
were
upon
island
the
fog
Even
they
looked
out
dismay
towards
the
setting
sun
sank
before
their
eyes
into
white
sea
and
cold
grey
shadow
sprang
the
East
behind
The
fog
rolled
the
walls
and
rose
above
them
and
mounted
bent
over
their
heads
until
became

they
were
shut

mist
whose
central
pillar
was
the
standing
stone
They
felt
trap
was
closing
about
them
but
they
did
not
quite
lose
heart
They
still
remembered
the
hopeful
view
they
had
had
the
line
the
Road
ahead
and
they
still
knew
which
direction
lay
any
case
they
now
had
great
dislike
for
that
hollow
place
about
the
stone
that
thought
remaining
there
was
their
minds
They
packed
quickly
their
chilled
fingers
would
work
Soon
they
were
leading
their
ponies
single
file
over
the
rim
and
down
the
long
northward
slope
the
hill
down
into
foggy
sea
they
went
down
the
mist
became
colder
and
damper
and
their
hair
hung
lank
and
dripping
their
foreheads
When
they
reached
the
bottom
was
chill
that
they
halted
and
got
out
cloaks
and
hoods
which
soon
became
bedewed
with
grey
drops
Then
mounting
their
ponies
they
went
slowly
again
feeling
their
way
the
rise
and
fall
the
ground
They
were
steering
well
they
could
guess
for
the
gate
like
opening
the
far
northward
end
the
long
valley
which
they
had
seen
the
morning
Once
they
were
through
the
gap
they
had
only
keep
anything
like
straight
line
and
they
were
bound
the
end
strike
the
Road
Their
thoughts
did
not
beyond
that
except
for
vague
hope
that
perhaps
away
beyond
the
Downs
there
might
fog
Their
going
was
very
slow
prevent
their
getting

wandering

The

Suddenly
Frodo
saw

sign
either
side

darkness
began
loom
through
the

guessed
that

back
over

hurried
forward
But
his
hope
soon
changed

derment
and
alarm
The
dark
patches
grew
darker
but
they
shrank
and
suddenly
saw
towering
ominous
before
him
and
leaning
slightly
towards
one
another
like
the

headless

two
huge
standing
stones
could
not
remember
having
seen
any

these
the

when
looked
out
from
the
hill
the
morning
had
passed
between
them
almost
before
was
aware
and
even
did
darkness
seemed
fall
round
him
His
pony
reared
and
snorted
and
fell
off
When
looked
back
found
that
was
alone
the
others
had
not
followed
him
Sam
called
Pippin
Merry
Come
along
Why
don
you
keep
There
was
answer
Fear
took
him
and
ran
back
past
the
stones
shouting
wildly

The

bolted
into

From

his

off

found
himself
going
steeply
uphill

again

kept
calling

heard

then
cry
that
sounded
like

often
repeated
ending
with

that
trailed
off
into
long
wail
suddenly
cut
short

night

closed
about
him

any

all

Only
the

the

him
when

was
weary

yet
chilled

Where

out
miserably
There

suddenly
aware
that
was
getting
very
cold
and
that
here

was
beginning

icy

change
was
coming
the

The
mist
was
flowing
past
him
now
shreds
and
tatters
His
breath
was
smoking
and
the
darkness
was
less
near
and
thick
looked
and
saw
with
surprise
that
faint
stars
were
appearing
overhead
amid
the
strands
hurrying
cloud
and
fog
The
wind
began
hiss
over
the
grass
imagined
suddenly
that
caught
muffled
cry
and
made
towards
and
even
went
forward
the
mist
was
rolled
and
thrust
aside
and
the
starry
sky
was
unveiled
glance
showed
him
that
was
now
facing
southwards
and
was
round

top
which
must
have
climbed

Out
the

the

angry

afraid

cold

seemed
come
out

waiting
for

Frodo
but
did
not
run
away
His
knees
gave
and
fell

Nothing
happened
and
there
was

Trembling
looked

tall

figure
like
shadow
against

leaned
over
him
thought
there
were
two
eyes
very
cold

lit
with
pale
light
that
seemed
come
from

Then
grip
stronger

colder

seized
him

When
came
himself
again
for
moment
could
recall
nothing
except
sense
dread
Then
suddenly
knew
that
was
imprisoned
caught
hopelessly
was
barrow
Barrow
wight
had
taken
him
and
was
probably
already
under
the
dreadful
spells
the
Barrow
wights
about
which
whispered
tales
spoke
dared
not
move
but
lay
found
himself
flat
his
back
upon
cold
stone
with
his
hands
his
breast
But
though
his
fear
was
great
that
seemed
part
the
very
darkness
that
was
round
him
found
himself
lay
thinking
about
Bilbo
Baggins
and
his
stories
their
jogging
along
together
the
lanes
the
Shire
and
talking
about
roads
and
adventures
There
seed

hidden
often
deeply
true
the
heart
the
fattest
and
most
timid
hobbit
waiting
for
some
final
and
desperate
danger
make
grow
Frodo
was
neither
very
fat
nor
very
timid
indeed
though
did
not
know
Bilbo
and
Gandalf
had
thought
him
the
best
hobbit
the
Shire
thought
had
come
the
end
his
adventure
and
terrible
end
but
the
thought
hardened
him
found
himself
stiffening
for
final
spring
longer
felt
limp
like
helpless
prey
lay
there
thinking
and
getting
hold
himself
noticed
all
once
that
the
darkness
was
slowly
giving
way
pale
greenish
light
was
growing
round
him
did
not
first
show
him
what
kind
place
was
for
the
light
seemed
coming
out
himself
and
from
the
floor
beside
him
and
had
not
yet
reached
the
roof
wall
turned
and
there
the
cold
glow
saw
lying
beside
him
Sam
Pippin
and
Merry
They
were
their
backs
and
their
faces
looked
deathly
pale
and
they
were
clad
white
About
them
lay
many
treasures
gold
maybe
though
that
light
they
looked
cold
and
unlovely
their
heads
were
circlets
gold
chains
were
about
their
waists
and
their
fingers
were
many
rings
Swords
lay
their
sides
and
shields
were
their
feet
But
across
their
three
necks
lay
one
long
naked
sword
THE
fellowship
the
ring
Suddenly
song
began
cold
murmur
rising
and
falling
The
voice
seemed
far
away
and
immeasurably
dreary
some
times
high
the
air
and
thin
sometimes
like
low
moan
from
the
ground
Out
the
formless
stream
sad
but
horrible
sounds
strings
words
would
now
and
again
shape
themselves
grim
hard
cold
words
heartless
and
miserable
The
night
was
railing
against
the
morning
which
was
bereaved
and
the
cold
was
cursing
the
warmth
for
which
hungered
Frodo
was
chilled
the
marrow
After
while
the
song
became
clearer
and
with
dread
his
heart
perceived
that
had
changed
into
incantation
Cold
hand
and
heart
and
bone
and
cold
sleep
under
stone
never
more
wake
stony
bed
never
till
the
Sun
fails
and

the

shall
die
and
still

here
let
them
lie
till
the
dark
lord
lifts
his
hand
over
dead
sea
and
withered
land
heard
behind
his
head
creaking
and
scraping
sound
Raising
himself
one
arm
looked
and
saw
now
the
pale
light
that
they
were
kind
passage
which
behind
them
turned
corner
Round
the
corner
long
arm
was
groping
walking
its
fingers
towards
Sam
who
was
lying
nearest
and
towards
the
hilt
the
sword
that
lay
upon
him
first
Frodo
felt
had
indeed
been
turned
into
stone
the
incantation
Then
wild
thought
escape
came
him
wondered
put
the
Ring
whether
the
Barrow
wight
would
miss
him
and
might
find
some
way

thought
himself
running
free
over

Gandalf
would
admit
that
there
had

wavered
groping
his
pocket
and
then
fought
with
himself
again
and
did
the
arm
crept
nearer
Suddenly
resolve
hardened
him
and
seized
short
sword
that
lay
beside
him
and
kneeling
stooped
low
over
the
bodies
his
companions
With
what
strength
had
hewed
the
crawling
arm
near
the
wrist
and
the
hand
broke
off
but
the
same
moment
the
sword
splintered
the

There
was
shriek
and
the
light
vanished
the
dark
there
was
snarling
noise
Frodo
fell
forward
over
Merry
and
Merry
face
felt
cold
All
once
back
into
his
mind
from

disappeared
with
the

After

upon

lying
beside
Frodo
They
did
not
stir
but
the
sickly
hue
had
left
them
They
looked
now
they
were
only
very
deeply
asleep
Tom
stooped
removed
his
hat
and
came
into

chamber
singing

there
was
cry
and
part
the
inner
end
the

fell
with
crash
Then
there
was
long
trailing
shriek
fading
away
into
unguessable
distance
and
after
that
silence
Come

Tom

with

Then
the

and
they
were
back
the
sunlit
world
was
time
start
again
They
made
ready
packing
their
bags
and
lading
their

Their

they
hung
their

under

feeling

wondering

Fighting

they

They
led
their

down

then
mounting

trotted
quickly
along
the

They
looked
back
and
saw
the
top
the

the

and
from
the

the

went
like
yellow

Then
they
turned

and
was
hidden
from

Though
Frodo
looked
about
him
every
side
saw
sign
the
great

standing
like

and
before
long
they
came
the
northern

and
rode
swiftly
through

the

fell

was

They
went
forward
steadily
but
they
soon
saw
that
the
Road
was
further
away
than
they
had
imagined
Even
without

their

mid

would
have
prevented
them

climbed
down

and
then
Tom
turned

been
bearing
somewhat

The
land
was
now
open
and
fairly
level
and
they
quickened
their
pace
but
the
sun
was
already
sinking
low
when
last
they
saw
line
tall
trees
ahead
and
they
knew
that
they
had
come
back
the
Road
after
many
unexpected
adventures
They
galloped
their
ponies
over
the
last
furlongs
and
halted
under
the
long
shadows
the
trees
They
were
the
top
sloping
bank
and
the
Road
now
dim
evening
drew
wound
away
below
them
this
point
ran
nearly
from
South
west
North
east
and
their
right
fell
quickly
down
into
wide
hollow

rutted
and
bore
many
signs
the
recent
heavy
rain
there
were
pools
and
pot
holes

They
rode
down
the
bank
and
looked
and

was

The

looked
him
The
shadow
the
fear
the
Black
Riders
came
suddenly
over
them
again
Ever
since
they
had
entered
the
Forest
they
had
thought
chiefly
getting
back
the
Road
only
now
when
lay
beneath
their
feet
did
they
remember
the
danger
which
pursued
them
and
was
more
than
likely
lying
wait
for
them
upon
the
Road
itself
They
looked
anxiously
back
towards
the

They
stood
silent
reluctant

the
final
parting
and
only
slowly
became
aware
that
Tom
was
wishing
them
farewell
and
telling
them
have
good
heart
and
ride
till
dark
without
halting
Tom
will
give
you
good

They

THE
SIGN
THE
PRANCING
PONY
Bree
was
the
chief
village
the
Bree
land
small
inhabited
region
like
island
the
empty
lands
round
about

Bree

there
was
Staddle

and
Archet

Chetwood
Lying
round
Bree

and
the
villages
was
small
country
fields
and
tamed
woodland
only
few
miles
broad
The
Men
Bree
were
brown
haired
broad
and
rather
short
cheerful
and
independent
they
belonged
nobody
but
themselves
but
they
were
more
friendly
and
familiar
with
Hobbits
Dwarves
Elves
and
other
inhabitants
the
world
about
them
than
was
usual
with
Big
People
According
their
own
tales
they
were
the
original
inhabitants
and
were
the
descendants
the
first
Men
that
ever
wandered
into
the
West
the
middle
world
Few
had
survived
the
turmoils
the
Elder
Days
but
when
the
Kings
returned
again
over
the
Great
Sea
they
had
found
the
Bree
men
still
there
and
they
were
still
there
now
when
the
memory
the
old
Kings
had
faded
into
the
grass
those
days
other
Men
had
settled
dwellings
far
west
within
hundred
leagues
the
Shire
But
the
wild
lands
beyond
Bree
there
were
mysterious
wanderers
The
Bree
folk
called
them
Rangers
and
knew
nothing
their
origin
They
were
taller
and
darker
than
the
Men
Bree
and
were
believed
have
strange
powers
sight
and
hearing
and
understand
the
languages
beasts
and
birds
They
roamed
will
southwards
and
eastwards
even
far
the
Misty
Mountains
but
they
were
now
few
and
rarely
seen
When
they
appeared
they
brought
news
from
afar
and
told
strange
forgotten
tales
which
were
196
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
eagerly
listened
but
the
Bree
folk
did
not
make
friends
them
There
were
also
many
families
hobbits
the
Bree
land
and
they
claimed
the
oldest
settlement
Hobbits
the
world
one
that
was
founded
long
before
even
the
Brandy
wine
was
crossed
and
the
Shire
colonized
They
lived
mostly
Staddle
though
there
were
some
Bree
itself
especially
the
higher
slopes
the
hill
above
the
houses
the
Men
The
Big
Folk
and
the
Little
Folk
they
called
one
another
were
friendly
terms
minding
their
own
affairs
their
own
ways
but
both
rightly
regarding
themselves
necessary
parts
the
Bree
folk
Nowhere
else
the
world
was
this
peculiar
but
excellent
arrangement
found
The
Bree
folk
Big
and
Little
did
not
themselves
travel
much
and
the
affairs
the
four
villages
were
their
chief
concern
Occasionally
the
Hobbits
Bree
went
far
Buckland
the
Eastfarthing
but
though
their
little
land
was
not
much
further
than
day
riding
east
the
Brandywine
Bridge
the
Hobbits
the
Shire
now
seldom
visited
occasional
Bucklander
adventurous
Took
would
come
out
the
Inn
for
night
two
but
even
that
was
becoming
less
and
less
usual
The
Shire
hobbits
referred
those
Bree
and
any
others
that
lived
beyond
the
borders
Outsiders
and
took
very
little
interest
them
considering
them
dull
and
uncouth
There
were
probably
many
more
Outsiders
scattered
about
the
West
the
World
those
days
than
the
people
the
Shire
imagined
Some
doubtless
were
better
than
tramps
ready
dig
hole
any
bank
and
stay
only
long
suited
them
But
the
Bree
land
any
rate
the
hobbits
were
decent
and
prosperous
and
more
rustic
than
most
their
distant
relatives
Inside
was
not
yet
forgotten
that
there
had
been
time
when
there
was
much
coming
and
going
between
the
Shire
and
Bree
There
was

The

had
some
hundred

There
was

the

The

when

and
when

But
the

and
the

was

was

and
the
Bree
folk
called
the

The

Bree
was
still
there
however
and
the
innkeeper
was
important
person
His

was

But
there
was
something
the

and
the

the

that
made
him
uneasy
The

stared
after
the

for

and
then
went

The

rode
gentle

passing
few

and
drew
outside

The

looked
large
and
strange
them
Sam
stared
the

with
its
three

and
many
windows
and
felt
his

sink
had
imagined
himself

taller
than

even
more
terrifying
some

other

but
the

was

They
listened

then
got

curiously
The
landlord
introduced
the
newcomers
the
Bree
folk
quickly
that
though
they
caught
many
names
they
were
seldom
sure
who
the
names
belonged
The
Men
Bree
seemed
all
have
rather
botanical
and
the
Shire
folk
rather
odd
names
like
Rushlight
Goatleaf
Heather
toes
Appledore
Thistlewool
and
Ferny
not
mention
Butterbur
Some
the
hobbits
had
similar
names
The
Mugworts
for
instance
seemed
numerous
But
most
them
had
natural
names
such
Banks
Brockhouse
Longholes
Sandheaver
and
Tunnelly
many
which
were
used
the
Shire
There
were
several
Underhills
from
Staddle
and
they
could
not
imagine
sharing
name
without
being
related
they
took
Frodo
their
hearts
long
lost
cousin
The
Bree
hobbits
were
fact
friendly
and
inquisitive
and
Frodo
soon
found
that
some
explanation
what
was
doing
would
have
given
gave
out
that
was
interested
history
and
geography
which
there
was
much
wagging
heads
although
neither
these
words
were
much
used
the
Bree
dialect
said
was
thinking
writing
book
which
there
was
silent
astonishment
and
that
and
his
friends
wanted
collect
information
about
hobbits
living
outside
the
Shire
especially
the
eastern
lands
this
chorus
voices
broke
out
Frodo
had
really
wanted
write
book
and
had
had
many
ears
would
have
learned
enough
for
several
chapters
few
minutes
And
that
was
not
enough
was
given
whole
list
names
beginning
with
Old
Barliman
here
whom
could
for
further
information
But
after
time
Frodo
did
not
show
any
sign
writing
book
the
spot
the
hobbits
returned
their
questions
about
doings
the
Shire
Frodo
did
not
prove
very
communicative
and
soon
found
himself
sitting
alone
corner
listening
and
looking
around
The
Men
and
Dwarves
were
mostly
talking
distant
events
and
telling
news
kind
that
was
becoming
only
too
familiar
There
was
trouble
away

that
the
Men
who
had
come
the

were
the
move
looking
for
lands
where
they
could
find
some
peace
The
Bree
folk
were
sympathetic
but
plainly
not
very
ready
take
large
number
strangers
into
their
little
land
One
the

squint

telling
that

They

said
loudly
The
local
inhabitants
did
not

The

did
not
pay
much
attention
all
this
did
not
the

seem

Big

could
hardly
beg
for

They
were
more
interested
Sam
and
Pippin
who
were
now
feeling
quite
home
and
were
chatting
gaily
about
events
the
Shire
Pippin
roused
good
deal
laughter
with
account
the
collapse
the
roof
the
Town
Hole
Michel
Delving
Will
Whitfoot
the
Mayor
and
the
fattest
hobbit
the
Westfarthing
had
been
buried
chalk
and
came
out
like
floured
dumpling
But
there
were
several
questions
asked
that
made
Frodo
little
uneasy
One
the
Bree
landers
who
seemed
have
been
the
Shire
several
times
wanted
know
where
the
Underhills
lived
and
who
they
were
related
Suddenly
Frodo
noticed
that
strange
looking
weather
beaten
man
sitting
the
shadows
near
the
wall
was
also
listening
intently
the
hobbit
talk
had
tall
tankard
front
him
and
was
smoking
long
stemmed
pipe
curiously
carved
His
legs
were
stretched
out
before
him
showing
high
boots
supple
leather
that
fitted
him
well
but
had
seen
much
wear
and
were
now
caked
with
mud
travel
stained
cloak
heavy
dark
green
cloth
was
drawn
close
about
him
and
spite
the
heat
the
room
wore
hood
that
overshadowed
his
face
but
the
gleam
his
eyes
could
seen
watched
the
hobbits

Presently
with

for

just

about

some

about
Bilbo
vanishing

bring

there
had

Bree
after

Frodo
fidgeted
wondering
what
Pippin
was
evi
dently
much
enjoying
the
attention
was
getting
and
had
become
quite
forgetful
their
danger
Frodo
had
sudden
fear
that
his
present
mood
might
even
mention
the
Ring
and
that
might
well
disastrous
You
had
better
something
quick
whispered
Strider
his
ear
Frodo
jumped
and
stood

and
began
talk
The

Pippin

was
disturbed
Some
the
hobbits
looked
Frodo
and
laughed
and
clapped
think
ing
that
Underhill
had
taken
much
ale
was
good
for
him
Frodo
suddenly
felt
very
foolish
and
found
himself
was
his
habit
when
making
speech
fingering
the
things
his
pocket
felt
the
Ring
its
chain
and
quite
unac
countably
the
desire
came
over
him
slip
and
vanish
out
the
silly
situation
seemed
him
somehow
the
suggestion
came
him
from

from

the

firmly
and
clasped

there

very

Presently

the

Frodo

Not

crawled
away
under

the

Strider

unmoved
giving

Frodo
leaned

against

off

How

his

not

could

suppose
that

that
somehow
had

stuck
out
his

his

For

Butterbur
did

reckoned
very

that

many

Now
what

Frightening

All

There

Merry

was

they
had
puffed
the

into

and
thrown
couple
faggots
that
they
discovered
Strider
had
come
with

There
was
calmly
sitting

the

Hallo
said
Pippin
Who
are

what
you
want
called
Strider
answered
and
though
may
have
forgotten
your

promised
have
quiet

with
You

believe
said
Frodo
What
have
you

Several
things
answered
Strider
But
course
have
price
What
you
mean
asked
Frodo
sharply
Don
alarmed
mean
just
this
will
tell
you
what
know
and
give
you
some
good
advice
but
shall
want
reward
And
what
will
that
pray
said
Frodo
suspected
now
that
had
fallen
with
rascal
and
thought
uncomfortably
that
had
brought
only
little
money
with
him
All
would
hardly
satisfy
rogue
and
could
not
spare
any
more
than
you
can
afford
answered
Strider
with
slow
smile
guessed
Frodo
thoughts
Just
this
you
must
take
along
with
you
until
wish
leave
you
indeed
replied
Frodo
surprised
but
not
much
relieved
Even
wanted
another

should
not
agree
any
such
thing
until
knew
good

more

Excellent
exclaimed
Strider
crossing
his
legs
and
sitting
back
comfortably
You
seem
coming
your
senses
again
and
that
all
the
good
You
have
been
much
too
careless
far
Very
well
will
tell
you
what
know
and
leave
the
reward
you
You
may
glad
grant
when
you
have

then
said
Frodo
What
you

Too

too
many

said
Strider
grimly
But
for

Then

Now

this

came
out

need
not

all
that
they
said
old
Bombadil
one
another
but
one
thing
interested
Please
remember
said
one
them
that
the

Baggins
must
not
mentioned
Underhill
any
name
must
given
That
interested
much
that
followed
them
here
slipped
over
the
gate
just
behind
them
Maybe
Baggins
has
honest
reason
for
leaving
his
name
behind
but
should
advise
him
and
his
friends
more
careful
don
see
what
interest
name
has
for
anyone
Bree
said
Frodo
angrily
and
have
still
learn
why
interests
you
Strider
may
have
honest
reason
for
spying
and
eavesdropping
but
should
advise

explain
Well
answered
said
Strider
laughing
But
the
explanation
simple
was
looking
for
Hobbit
called
Frodo
Baggins
wanted
find
him
quickly
had
learned
that
was

out

cried
Frodo
rose
from

and
Sam
jumped
with

another

later
coming

from

There
was
silence
last
Frodo
spoke
Pippin
and
Sam
ought
have
guessed
from
the

the
gatekeeper
greeted
said
And
the

seems
have
heard
something
Why
did
press
join
the
company
And
why
earth
did
behave
foolishly
ought
have
stayed
quiet
here
would
have
been
better
said
Strider
would
have
stopped
your
going
into

could
but
the
innkeeper
would
not
let
see
you
take
message
you
think
began
Frodo
don
think
any
harm
old
Butterbur
Only
does
not
altogether
like
mysterious

sort
Frodo
gave
him
puzzled
look
Well
have
rather
rascally
look
have
not
said
Strider
with
curl
his
lip
and
queer
gleam
his
eye
But
hope
shall
get
know
one
another
better
When
hope
you
will
explain
what
happened
the
end

For
that
little
prank
was
sheer
accident
interrupted
Frodo
wonder
said
Strider
Accident
then
That
accident
has
made
your
position
dangerous
Hardly
more

was
already
said
Frodo
knew
these
horsemen
were
pursuing
but
now
any
rate
they
seem
have
missed
and
have
gone
away
You
must
not
count
that
said
Strider
sharply
They
will
return
And
more

coming
There

look
might
prove
useful
You
will
have
leave
the
open
road
after
tonight
for
the
horsemen
will
watch
night
and
day
You
may
escape
from
Bree
and
allowed
forward
while
the
Sun
but
you
won
far
They
will
come
you
the
wild
some
dark
place
where
there
help
you
wish
them
find
you
They
are
terrible
The
hobbits
looked
him
and
saw
with
surprise
that
his
face
was
drawn
with
pain
and
his
hands
clenched
the
arms
his
chair
The
room
was
very
quiet
and
still
and
the
light
seemed
have
grown
dim
For
while
sat
with
unseeing
eyes
walking
distant
memory
listening
sounds
the
Night
far
away
There
cried
after
moment
drawing
his
hand
across
his
brow
Perhaps
know
more
about
these
pursuers
than
you
You
fear
them
but
you
not
fear
them
enough
yet
Tomorrow
you
will
have
escape
you
can
Strider
can
take
you
paths
that
are
seldom
trodden
Will
you
have
him
There
was
heavy
silence
Frodo
made
answer
his
mind
was
confused
with
doubt
and
fear
Sam
frowned
and
looked
his
master
and
last
broke
out
With
your
leave
Frodo
say
This
Strider
here
STRIDER
217
warns
and
says
take
care
and
say
yes
that
and
let
begin
with
him
comes
out
the
Wild
and
never
heard
good
such
folic
knows
something
that
plain
and
more
than
like
but
reason
why
should
let
him
leading
out
into
some
dark
place
far
from
help
puts
Pippin
fidgeted
and
looked
uncomfortable
Strider
did
not
reply
Sam
but
turned
his
keen
eyes
Frodo
Frodo
caught
his
glance
and
looked
away
said
slowly
don
agree
think
think
you
are
not
really
you
choose
look
You
began
talk
like
the
Bree
folk
but
your
voice
has
changed
Still
Sam
seems
right
this
don
see
why
you
should
warn
take
care
and
yet
ask
take
you
trust
Why
the
disguise
Who
are
you
What
you
really
know
about
about
business
and
how
you
know
The
lesson
caution
has
been
well
learned
said
Strider
with
grim
smile
But
caution
one
thing
and
wavering
another
You
will
never
get
Rivendell
now
your
own
and
trust
your
only
chance
You
must
make
your
mind
will
answer
some
your
questions
that
will
help
you
But
why
should
you
believe
story
you
not
trust
already
Still
here
that
moment
there
came
knock
the
door
Butterbur
had
arrived
with
candles
and
behind
him
was
Nob
with
cans
hot
water
Strider
withdrew
into
dark
corner
come
bid
you
good
night
said
the
landlord
putting
the
candles
the
table
Nob
Take
the
water
the
rooms
came
and
shut
the
door
like
this
began
hesitating
and
looking
troubled
done
any
harm
sorry
indeed
But
one
thing
drives
out
another
you
admit
and
busy
man
But
first
one
thing
and
then
another
this
week
have
jogged
memory
the
saying
goes
and
not
too
late
hope
You
see
was
asked
look
out
for
hobbits
the
Shire
and
for
one
the
name
Baggins
particular

THE

THE
RING
And
what
has
that
got
with
asked
Frodo
you
know
best
said
the
landlord
knowingly
won
give
you
away
but
was
told
that
this
Baggins
would
going
the
name
Underhill
and
was
given
description
that
fits
you
well
enough
may
say
Indeed
Let
have
then
said
Frodo
unwisely
inter
rupting
stout
little
fellow
with
red
cheeks
said
Butterbur
solemnly
Pippin
chuckled
but
Sam
looked
indignant
That
won
help
you
much
goes
for
most
hobbits
Barley
says
continued
Butterbur
with
glance
Pippin
But
this
one
taller
than
some
and
fairer
than
most
and
has
cleft
his
chin
perky
chap
with
bright
eye
Begging
your
pardon
but
said
not
said
And
who
was
asked
Frodo
eagerly
That
was
Gandalf
you
know
who
mean
wizard
they
say
but
good
friend
mine
whether
But
now
don
know
what
have

see
him
again
turn
all
ale
sour
into
block

shouldn
wonder
bit
hasty
Still
what
done
can
undone
Well
what
have
you
done
said
Frodo
getting
impatient
with
the
slow
unravelling
Butterbur
thoughts
Where
was
said
the
landlord
pausing
and
snapping
his
fingers
yes
Old
Gandalf
Three
months
back
walked
right
into

without

Barley

says
and
then
gave

Butterbur

and

Frodo
said
Butterbur
Then

Frodo

you

and

That

tell
suppose
though
you
taken
long
time

Poor
Butterbur

troubled
You

said
and
beg
your
pardon
And
mortal
afraid
what
Gandalf

But
didn

Then
couldn
find
nobody
willing

Leaving

And

They

The

You

Frodo

Butterbur
looking
suspiciously

But

Then
who

asked
Strider
fat
innkeeper
who

because

him
all

They

Butterbur
But
they

without

Baggins
drew
attention
himself
this
evening
say
more
The

Bree
Even

Butterbur

shake

His

retreated
down

Well

Strider
When

Frodo

himself
and
then
passed
Pippin
and
Sam
Really

Strider
Frodo

and

about

with

relief
after

Pippin
subsided
but
Sam
was
not

and
still

dubiously

You
might
have
done
the

and
took
his

What

That
you
are
stout

answered
Strider
but
afraid
only
answer
you
Sam
Gamgee
this
had
killed
the
real
Strider
could
kill
you
And
should
have
killed
you
already
without
much
talk
was
after
the
Ring
could
have
now
stood
and
seemed
suddenly
grow
taller
his
eyes
gleamed
light
keen
and
commanding
Throwing
back
his
cloak
laid
his
hand
the
hilt
sword
that
had
hung
concealed
his
side
They
did
not
dare
move
Sam
sat
wide
mouthed
staring
him
dumbly
But
the
real
Strider
fortunately
said
looking
down
them
with
his
face
softened
sudden
smile
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
and
life
death
can
save
you

There
was
long
silence
last
Frodo
spoke
with
hesita
tion
believed
that
you
were
friend
before
the
letter
came
said
least
wished
You
have
frightened
several
times
tonight
but
never
the
way
that
servants
the
Enemy
would
imagine
think
one
his
spies
would
well
seem
fairer
and
feel
fouler
you
understand

laughed
Strider
look
foul
and
feel
fair
that
All
that
gold
does
not
glitter
not
all
those
who
wander
are
lost
Did
the
verses
apply
you
then
asked
Frodo
could
not
make
out
what
they
were
about
But
how
did
you
know
that
they
were
Gandalf
letter
you
have
never
seen
did
not

answered
But
Aragorn
and
those
verses
with
that
name
drew
out
his
sword
and
they
saw
that
the
blade
was
indeed
broken
foot
below
the
hilt
Not
much
use
Sam
said
Strider
But
the
time
near
when

Sam
said
nothing
Well
said
Strider
with
Sam
permission
will
call

And
now

Even

But

know
one
two
ways
out
Bree
land
other
than
the
main
road
once
shake
off
the
pursuit
shall
make
for
Weathertop
Weathertop
said
Sam
What
that
hill
just
the
north
the
Road
about
half
way
from
here
Rivendell
commands
wide
view
all
round
and
there
shall
have
chance
look
about
Gandalf
will
make
for
that
point
follows
After
Weathertop
our
journey
will
become
more
difficult
and
shall
have
choose
between
various
dangers
When
did
you

Frodo

first
May
Sarn

And
that

for
the
first
time
since
have
known
him

When

many
days
ago
heard
the
ill
news
The
tidings
had
gone
far
and
wide
that
Gandalf
was
missing
and
the
horsemen

been
seen

the
vcn
folk
Gildor
that

this
and
later
they
told
that

but
there
was
news
your
leaving
Buckland
have
been
watching
the
East
Road
anxiously
you
think
the
Black
Riders
have
anything
with
with
Gandalf
absence
mean
asked
Frodo
not
know
anything
else
that
could
have
hindered
him
except
the
Enemy
himself
said
Strider
But
not
226
THE

THE
RING
give
hope
Gandalf
greater
than
you
Shire
folk
know
rule
you
can
only
see
his
jokes
and
toys
But
this
business
ours
will
his
greatest
task
Pippin
yawned
sorry
said
but
dead
tired
spite
all
the
danger
and
worry
must
bed
sleep
where
sit
Where
that
silly
fellow
Merry
would
the
last
straw
had
out
the
dark
look
for
him
that
moment
they
heard
door
slam
then
feet
came
running
along
the
passage
Merry
came
with
rush
fol
lowed
Nob
shut
the
door
hastily
and
leaned
against
was
out
breath
They
stared
him
alarm
for
moment
before
gasped
have
seen
them
Frodo
have
seen
them
Black
Riders
Black
Riders
cried
Frodo
Where
Here
the
village
stayed
indoors
for
hour
Then
you
did
not
come
back
went
out
for
stroll
had
come
back
again
and
was
standing
just
outside
the
light
the
lamp
looking
the
stars
Suddenly
shivered
and
felt
that
something
horrible
was
creeping
near
there
was
sort
deeper
shade
among
the
shadows
across
the
road
just
beyond
the
edge
the
lamplight
slid
away
once
into
the
dark
without
sound
There
was
horse
Which
way
did
asked
Strider
suddenly
and
sharply
Merry
started
noticing
the
stranger
for
the
first
time
said
Frodo
This
friend
Gandalf
will
explain
later
seemed
make
off
the
Road
eastward
continued
Merry
tried
follow
course
vanished
almost
once
but
went
round
the
corner
and
far
the
last
house
the
Road
Strider
looked
Merry
with
wonder
You
have
stout
heart
said
but
was
foolish
don
know
said
Merry
Neither
brave
nor
silly
think
could
hardly
help
myself
seemed
drawn
somehow
Anyway
went
and
suddenly
heard
voices
the
hedge
STRIDER
227
One
was
muttering
and
the
other
was
whispering
hissing
couldn
hear
word
that
was
said
did
not
creep
any
closer
because
began
tremble
all
over
Then
felt
terri
fied
and
turned
back
and
was
just
going
bolt
home
when
something
came
behind
and
fell
over
found
him
sir
put
Nob
Butterbur
sent
out
with
lantern
went
down
West
gate
and
then
back
towards
South
gate
Just
nigh
Bill
Ferny
house
thought
could
see
something
the
Road
couldn
swear
but
looked
two
men
was
stooping
over
something
lifting
gave
shout
but
when
got
the
spot
there
was
signs
them
and
only
Brandybuck
lying
the
roadside
seemed
asleep
thought
had
fallen
into
deep
water
says
when
shook
him
Very
queer
was
and
soon
had
roused
him
got
and
ran
back
here
like
hare
afraid
that
true
said
Merry
though
don
know
what
said
had
ugly
dream
which
can
remember
went
pieces
don
know
what
came
over
said
Strider
The
Black
Breath
The
Riders
must
have
left
their
horses
outside
and
passed
back
through
the
South
gate
secret
They
will
know
all
the
news
now
for
they
have
visited
Bill
Ferny
and
probably
that
Southerner
was
spy
well
Something
may
happen
the
night
before
leave
Bree
What
will
happen
said
Merry
Will
they
attack
the
inn
think
not
said
Strider
They
are
not
all
here
yet
And
any
case
that
not
their
way
dark
and
loneliness
they
are
strongest
they
will
not
openly
attack
house
where
there
are
lights
and
many
people
not
until
they
are
des
perate
not
while
all
the
long
leagues
Eriador
still
lie
before
But
their
power
terror
and
already
some
Bree
are
their
clutch
They
will
drive
these
wretches
some
evil
work
Ferny
and
some
the
strangers
and
maybe
the
gatekeeper
too
They
had
words
with
Harry
West
gate
Monday
was
watching
them
was
white
and
shaking
when
they
left
him
228
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
seem
have
enemies
all
round
said
Frodo
What
are
Stay
here
and
not
your
rooms
They
are
sure
have
found
out
which
those
are
The
hobbit
rooms
have
windows
looking
north
and
close
the
ground
will
all
remain
together
and
bar
this
window
and
the
door
But
first
Nob
and
will
fetch
your
luggage
While
Strider
was
gone
Frodo
gave
Merry
rapid
account
all
that
had
happened
since
supper
Merry
was
still
read
ing
and
pondering
Gandalf
letter
when
Strider
and
Nob
returned
Well
Masters
said
Nob
ruffled
the
clothes
and
put
bolster
down
the
middle
each
bed
And
made
nice
imitation
your
head
with
brown
woollen
mat
Bag
Underhill
sir
added
with
grin
Pippin
laughed
Very
life
like
said
But
what
will
happen
when
they
have
penetrated
the
disguise
shall
see
said
Strider
Let
hope
hold
the
fort
till
morning
Good
night
you
said
Nob
and
went
off
take
his
part
the
watch
the
doors
Their
bags
and
gear
they
piled
the
parlour
floor
They
pushed
low
chair
against
the
door
and
shut
the
window
Peering
out
Frodo
saw
that
the
night
was
still
clear
The
Sickle
was
swinging
bright
above
the
shoulders
Bree
hill
then
closed
and
barred
the
heavy
inside
shutters
and
drew
the
curtains
together
Strider
built
the
fire
and
blew
out
all
the
candles
The
hobbits
lay
down
their
blankets
with
their
feet
towards
the
hearth
but
Strider
settled
himself
the
chair
against
the
door
They
talked
for
little
for
Merry
still
had
several
questions
ask
Jumped
over
the
Moon
chuckled
Merry
rolled
him
self
his
blanket
Very
ridiculous
you
Frodo
But
wish
The

STRIDER

The

said
Strider
Then
they
all
fell
silent
and
one

the
hobbits
dropped
off

THE

they
prepared
for

the
inn
Bree
darkness
lay
Buckland
mist
strayed
the
dells
and
along
the
river
bank
The
house
Crickhollow
stood
silent
Fatty
Bolger
opened
the
door
cautiously
and
peered
out
feeling
fear
had
been
growing
him
all
day
and
was
unable
rest
bed
there
was
brooding
threat
the
breathless
night
air
stared
out
into
the
gloom
black
shadow
moved
under
the
trees
the
gate
seemed
open
its
own
accord
and
close
again
without
sound
Terror
seized
him
shrank
back
and
for
moment
stood
trembling
the
hall
Then
shut
and
locked
the
door
The
night
deepened
There
came
the
soft
sound
horses
led
with
stealth
along
the
lane
Outside
the
gate
they
stopped
and
three
black
figures
entered
like
shades
night
creeping
across
the
ground
One
went
the
door
one
the
corner
the
house
either
side
and
there
they
stood
still
the
shadows
stones
while
night
went
slowly
The
house
and
the
quiet
trees
seemed
waiting
breathlessly
There
was
faint
stir
the
leaves
and
cock
crowed
far
away
The
cold
hour
before
dawn
was
passing
The
figure
the
door
moved
the
dark
without
moon
stars
drawn
blade
gleamed
chill
light
had
been
unsheathed
There
was
blow
soft
but
heavy
and
the
door
shuddered
Open
the
name
Mordor
said
voice
thin
and
menacing
second
blow
the
door
yielded
and
fell
back
with
timbers
burst
and
lock
broken
The
black
figures
passed
swiftly
that
moment
among
the
trees
nearby

awaice

Fatty
Bolger
had
not
been
idle
soon
saw
the
dark
shapes
creep
from
the
garden
knew
that
must
run
for
perish
And
run
did
out
the
back
door
through
the
garden
and
over
the
fields
When
reached
the
nearest
house
more
than
mile
away
collapsed
the
doorstep
was
crying
not
haven
got
was
some
time
before
anyone
could
make
out
what
was
babbling
about
last
they
got
the
idea
that
enemies
were
Buckland
some
strange
invasion
from
the
Old
Forest
And
then
they
lost
more
time
fear
fire
foes
The
Brandybucks
were
blowing
the
Horn
call
Buckland
that
had
not
been
sounded
for
hundred
years
not
since
the
white
wolves
came
the
Fell
Winter
when
the
Brandywine
was
frozen
over
awake
awake
Far
away
answering
horns
were
heard
The
alarm
was
spreading
The
black
figures
fled
from
the
house
One

let
fall
hobbit
cloak
the
step
ran
the
lane
the
noise
hoofs
broke
out
and
gathering
gallop
went
hammering
away
into
the
darkness
All
about
Crickhollow
there
was
the
sound
horns
blowing
and
voices
crying
and
feet
running
But
the
Black
Riders
rode
like
gale
the
North
gate
Let
the
little
people
blow
Sauron
would
deal
with
them
later
Meanwhile
they
had
another
errand
they
knew
now
that
the
house
was
empty
and
the
Ring
had
gone
They
rode
down
the
guards
the
gate
and
vanished
from
the
Shire

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
the
early
night
Frodo
woke
from
deep
sleep
suddenly
some
sound
presence
had
disturbed
him
saw
that
Strider
was
sitting
alert
his
chair
his
eyes
gleamed
the
light
the
fire
which
had
been
tended
and
was
burning
brightly
but
made
sign
movement
Frodo
soon
went
sleep
again
but
his
dreams
were
again
troubled
with
the
noise
wind
and
galloping
hoofs
The
wind
seemed
curling
round
the
house
and
shaking
and
far
off
heard
horn
blowing
wildly
opened
his
eyes
and
heard
cock
crowing
lustily
the
inn
yard
Strider
had
drawn
the
curtains
and
pushed
back
the
shutters
with
clang
The
first
grey
light
day
was
the
room
and
cold
air
was
coming
through
the
open
window
soon
Strider
had
roused
them
all
led
the
way
their
bedrooms
When
they
saw
them
they
were
glad
that
they
had
taken
his
advice
the
windows
had
been
forced
open
and
were
swinging
and
the
curtains
were
flapping
the
beds
were
tossed
about
and
the
bolsters
slashed
and
flung
upon
the
floor
the
brown
mat
was
torn
pieces
Strider
immediately
went
fetch
the
landlord
Poor
Butterbur
looked
sleepy
and
frightened
had
hardly
closed
his
eyes
all
night
said
but
had
never
heard
sound
Never
has
such
thing
happened
time
cried
raising
his
hands
horror
Guests
unable
sleep
their
beds
and
good
bolsters
ruined
and
all
What
are
coming
Dark
times
said
Strider
But
for
the
present
you
may
left
peace
when
you
have
got
rid
will
leave
once
Never
mind
about
breakfast
drink
and
bite
standing
will
have
shall
packed
few
minutes
Butterbur
hurried
off
see
that
their
ponies
were
got
ready
and
fetch
them
bite
But
very
soon
came
back
dismay
The
ponies
had
vanished
The
stable
doors
had
all
been
opened
the
night
and
they
were
gone
not
only
Merry
ponies
but
every
other
horse
and
beast
the
place
Frodo
was
crushed
the
news
How
could
they
hope
reach
Rivendell
foot
pursued
mounted
enemies
They
KNIFE
THE
DARK
233
might
well
set
out
for
the
Moon
Strider
sat
silent
for
while
looking
the
hobbits
was
weighing
their
strength
and
courage
Ponies
would
not
help
escape
horsemen
said
last
thoughtfully
guessed
what
Frodo
had
mind
should
not
much
slower
foot
not

roads
that
mean
take

going
walk
any
case
the
food
and

that
trouble
cannot
count
getting
anything
eat
between
here
and
Rivendell
except
what
take
with
and
ought
take
plenty
spare
for
may
delayed
forced
round
about
far
out
the
direct
way
How
much
are
you
prepared
carry
your
backs
much
must
said
Pippin
with
sinking
heart
but
trying
show
that
was
tougher
than
looked
felt
can
carry
enough
for
two
said
Sam
defiantly
Can
anything
done
Butterbur
asked
Frodo
Can
get
couple
ponies
the
village
even
one
just
for
the
baggage
don
suppose
could
hire
them
but
might
able
buy
them
added
doubtfully
wondering
could
afford
doubt
said
the
landlord
unhappily
The
two
three
riding
ponies
that
there
were
Bree
were
stabled
yard
and
they
gone
for
other
animals
horses
ponies
for
draught
what
not
there
are
very
few
them
Bree
and
they
won
for
sale
But
what
can
rout
out
Bob
and
send
him
round
soon
may
Yes
said
Strider
reluctantly
you
had
better
that
afraid
shall
have
try
get
one
pony
least
But
ends
all
hope
starting
early
and
slipping
away
quietly
might
well
have
blown
horn
announce
our
departure
That
was
part
their
plan

There
one
crumb

said
Merry
and
more
than
crumb
hope
can
have
breakfast
while
wait
and
sit
down
Let

THE

THE
RING
the
end
there
was
more
than
three
hours
delay
Bob
came
back
with
the
report
that
horse
pony
was
got
for
love
money
the
neighbourhood
except
one
Bill
Ferny
had
one
that
might
possibly
sell
poor
old
half
starved
creature
said
Bob
but
won
part
with
for
less
than
thrice
its
worth
seeing
how
you
placed
not
knows
Bill
Ferny
Bill
Ferny
said
Frodo
Isn
there
some
trick
Wouldn
the
beast
bolt
back
him
with
all
our
stuff
help
tracking
something
wonder
said
Strider
But
cannot
imagine
any
animal
running
home
him
once
got
away
fancy
this
only
afterthought
kind
Master
Ferny
just
way
increas
ing
his
profits
from
the
affair
The
chief
danger
that
the
poor
beast
probably
death
door
But
there
does
not
seem
any
choice
What
does
want
for
Bill
Ferny
price
was
twelve
silver
pennies
and
that
was
indeed
least
three
times
the
pony
value
those
parts
proved
bony
underfed
and
dispirited
animal
but
did
not
look
like
dying
just
yet
Butterbur
paid
for
himself
and
offered
Merry
another
eighteen
pence
some
compensation
for
the
lost
animals
was
honest
man
and
well
off
things
were
reckoned
Bree
but
thirty
silver
pennies
was
sore
blow
him
and
being
cheated
Bill
Ferny
made
harder
bear
matter
fact
came
out
the
right
side
the
end
turned
out
later
that
only
one
horse
had
been
actually
stolen
The
others
had
been
driven
off
had
bolted
terror
and
were
found
wandering
different
corners
the
Bree
land
Merry
ponies
had
escaped
altogether
and
eventually
having
good
deal
sense
they
made
their
way
the
Downs
search
Fatty
Lumpkin
they
came
under
the
care
Tom
Bombadil
for
while
and
were
well
off
But
when
news
the
events
Bree
came
Tom
ears
sent
them
Butterbur
who
thus
got
five
good
beasts
very
fair
price
They
had
work
harder
Bree
but
Bob
treated
them
well
the
whole
they
were
lucky
they
KNIFE
THE
DARK
235
missed
dark
and
dangerous
journey
But
they
never
came
Rivendell
However
the
meanwhile
for
all
Butterbur
knew
his
money
was
gone
for
good
for
bad
And
had
other
troubles
For
there
was
great
commotion
soon
the
remaining
guests
were
astir
and
heard
news
the
raid
the
inn
The
southern
travellers
had
lost
several
horses
and
blamed
the
innkeeper
loudly
until
became
known
that
one
their
own
number
had
also
disappeared
the
night
none
other
than
Bill
Ferny
squint
eyed
companion
Suspicion
fell
him
once
you
pick
with
horse
thief
and
bring
him
house
said
Butterbur
angrily
you
ought
pay
for
all
the
damage
yourselves
and
not
come
shouting
and
ask
Ferny
where
your
handsome
friend
But
appeared
that
was
nobody
friend
and
nobody
could
recollect
when
had
joined
their
party
After
their
breakfast
the
hobbits
had
pack
and
get
together
further
supplies
for
the
longer
journey
they
were
now
expecting
was
close
ten
clock
before
they
last
got
off
that
time
the
whole
Bree
was
buzzing
with
excitement
Frodo
vanishing
trick
the
appearance
the
black
horsemen
the
robbing
the
stables
and
not
least
the
news
that
Strider
the
Ranger
had
joined
the
mysterious
hobbits
made
such
tale
would
last
for
many
uneventful
years
Most
the
inhabitants
Bree
and
Staddle
and
many
even
from
Combe
and
Archet
were
crowded
the
road
see
the
travellers
start
The
other
guests
the
inn
were
the
doors
hanging
out
the
windows
Strider
had
changed
his
mind
and
had
decided
leave
Bree
the
main
road
Any
attempt
set
off
across
country
once
would
only
make
matters
worse
half
the
inhabitants
would
follow
them
see
what
they
were
and
prevent
them
from
trespassing
They
said
farewell
Nob
and
Bob
and
took
leave
Butterbur
with
many
thanks
hope
shall
meet
again

They
tramped
off
anxious
and
downhearted
under
the
eyes
the
crowd
Not
all
the
faces
were
friendly
nor
all
the
words
that
were

But
Strider
seemed
held

most
the

But

The
hobbits
took
notice
the
inquisitive
heads
that
peeped
out
doors
popped
over
walls
and
fences
they
passed
But
they
drew
near
the

Frodo
saw

the

the

sallow
face
with

but
vanished
once
that
where
that

hiding
thought
looks
more
than
half
like

Over
the
hedge
another
man
was
staring
boldly
had
heavy
black
brows
and
dark
scornful
eyes
his
large
mouth
curled
sneer
was
smoking
short
black
pipe
they
approached
took
out

and
spat

and

they
left
the
village
behind
The

children
and
stragglers
that
had

them
got
tired
and
turned
back
the
South
gate
Passing
through
they
kept
along
the
Road
for
some
miles
bent
the

curving
back
into
its

line
rounded

hill
and
then
began
run
swiftly
downwards
into

some
the

Staddle
the

the

away
north
the

there
were

rising

that
showed

After
the

had
run
down
some
way
and
had
left

hill
standing
tall
and
brown
behind
they
came
narrow
track
that
led
off
towards
the
North
This

Strider
Not

Pippin

took
look
and
down

and
led
the

quickly
down
towards
the

His
plan
far
they
could
understand
without

ing
the

was
towards
Archet
first
but
bear
right
and
pass

and

all

cut

But
course
they
would
have
pass
through
the

themselves
and
Strider
description
them
was
not
encouraging
However
the

was

Indeed

night
before
they
would
have

the

better
than

The
sun
was
shining
clear
but
not
too
hot
The
woods
the
valley
were
still
leafy
and
full
colour
and
seemed

that
day
neither

nor
four

except

and

The
next
day
they
began
steer
steady
course
eastwards
and
still
all
was
quiet
and
peaceful
the
third
day
out
from
Bree
they
came
out
the
Chetwood
The
land
had
been
falling
steadily
ever
since
they
turned
aside
from
the
Road
and
they
now
entered
wide
flat
expanse
country
much
more
difficult
manage
They
were
far
beyond
the
borders
the
Bree
land
out
the
pathless
wilderness
and
drawing
near
the
Midgewater
Marshes
The
ground
now
became
damp
and
places
boggy
and
here
and
there
they
came
upon
pools
and
wide
stretches
reeds
and
rushes
filled
with
the
warbling
little
hidden
birds
They
had
pick
their
way
carefully
keep
both
dry
footed
and
their
proper
course
first
they
made
fair
progress
but
they
went
their
passage
became
slower
and
more
dangerous
The
marshes
were
bewildering
and
treacherous
and
there
was
permanent
trail
even
for
Rangers
find
through
their
shifting
quagmires
The
flies
began
torment
them
and
the

was

There

What
they
live
when

can
get
hobbit
asked
Sam
scratching
his
neck
They
spent
miserable
day
this
lonely
and
unpleasant
country
Their
camping
place
was
damp
cold
and
uncom
fortable
and
the
biting
insects
would
not
let
them
sleep
There
were
also
abominable
creatures
haunting
the
reeds
and
tussocks
that
from
the
sound
them
were
evil
relatives
the
cricket
There
were
thousands
them
and
they
squeaked
all
round
neek
breek
breek
neek
unceasingly
all
the
night
until
the
hobbits
were
nearly
frantic
The
next
day
the
fourth
was
little
better
and
the
night
almost
comfortless
Though
the
Neekerbreekers
Sam
called
them
had
been
left
behind
the
midges
still
pursued
them
Frodo
lay
tired
but
unable
close
his
eyes
seemed
him
that
far
away
there
came
light
the
eastern
sky
flashed
and
faded
many
times
was
not
the
dawn
for
that
was
still
some
hours
off
What
the
light
said
Strider
who
had
risen
and
was
standing
gazing
ahead
into
the
night
not
know
Strider
answered
too
distant
make
out
like
lightning
that
leaps
from
the
hill
tops
Frodo
lay
down
again
but
for
long
while
could
still
see
the
white
flashes
and
against
them
the
tall
dark
figure
Strider
standing
silent
and
watchful
last
passed
into
uneasy
sleep
They
had
not
gone
far
the
fifth
day
when
they
left
the
last
straggling
pools
and
reed
beds
the
marshes
behind
them
The
land
before
them
began
steadily
rise
again
Away
the
distance
eastward
they
could
now
see
line
hills
The
highest
them
was
the
right

line

Yes

Indeed
there
are
many
birds
and
beasts
this
country
that
could

here
from
that
hill
top
Not
all
the
birds
are
trusted
and
there
are
other
spies
more
evil
than
they
are
The
hobbits
looked
anxiously
the
distant
hills
Sam
looked
into
the
pale
sky
fearing
see
hawks
eagles
hovering
over
them
with
bright
unfriendly
eyes
You
make

uncomfortable
and
lonesome
Strider
said
What
you
advise

Frodo

answered
Strider
slowly
was
not
quite
sure
think
the
best
thing
straight
eastward

here

make

the

not
for

There

their
feet

openly
Then
shall
see

All
that
day
they
plodded
along
until
the
cold
and
early
evening
came
down
The
land
became
drier
and
more
barren
but
mists
and
vapours
lay
behind
them
the
marshes
few
melancholy
birds
were
piping
and
wailing
until
the
round
red
sun
sank
slowly
into
the
western
shadows
then
empty

fell

they
came

that
wandered
down
from

lose
itself
the
stagnant
marshland
and
they
went
along
its
hanks
while
the
light
lasted
was
already
night
when
last
they
halted
and
made
their
camp
under
some
stunted
alder
trees
the
shores
the
stream
Ahead
there
loomed
now
against
the
dusky
sky
the
bleak
and
treeless
backs
the
hills
That
night
they
set
watch
and
Strider
seemed
did
not
sleep
all
The
moon
was
waxing
and
the
early
night
hours
cold
grey
light
lay
the
land
Next
morning
they
set
out
again
soon
after
sunrise
There
was
frost
the
air
and
the
sky
was
pale
clear
blue
The
hobbits
felt
refreshed
they
had
had
night
unbroken
sleep
Already
they
were
getting
used
much
walking
short
commons
shorter
any
rate
than
what
the
Shire
they
would
have
thought
barely

Pippin
declared
that
Frodo
was
looking
twice
the

been
Very
odd

Frodo
tightening
his

considering
that
there

good

less
hope
the
thinning
process
will
not

shall
become
wraith
not
speak
such
things
said
Strider
quickly
and
with
surprising
earnestness
The
hills
drew
nearer
They
made

ridge
often
rising
almost
thousand
feet
and
here
and
there
falling
again
low
clefts

leading
into
the

Along
the
crest
the
ridge
the

could
see

looked

and

and

The

did
not

here
though
their
latter
days
they
defended
the
hills
for
while
against
the
evil

came
out
Angmar
This
path
was
made
serve
the

along

But
long

the

built

Yet
once

out

The

Strider
seemed
that
was

lore
well
the

Who

Gil

asked
Merry
but
Strider
did
not

and
seemed

Suddenly
low
voice
murmured
Gil

was
Elven
king
him
the
harpers
sadly
sing

whose

was
fair
and

His

said
Strider
was
already
mid
day
when
they
drew
near
the
southern
end
the
path
and
saw
before
them
the
pale
clear
light
the
October
sun
grey
green
bank
leading
like
bridge
the
northward
slope
the
hill
They
decided
make
for
the
top
once
while
the
daylight
was
broad
Concealment
was
longer
possible
and
they
could
only
hope
that
enemy
spy
was
observing
them
Nothing
was
seen
moving
the

Gandalf
was
anywhere
about
there

they
found
sheltered

the
bottom
which
there
was

with

sides
There
they
left
Sam

Pippin
with
the

and
their

The

went

plodding

THE

THE

the
hill
Frodo
and
Merry
followed
tired
and
breathless
The
last
slope
had
been
steep
and
rocky
the
top
they
found
Strider
had
said
wide
ring
ancient
stone
work
now
crumbling
covered
with
age
long
grass
But
the
centre
cairn
broken
stones
had
been
piled
They
were
blackened
with
fire
About
them
the
turf
was
burned
the
roots
and
all
within
the
ring
the
grass
was
scorched
and
shrivelled
flames
had
swept
the
hill
top
but
there
was
sign
any
living
thing
Standing
upon
the
rim
the
ruined
circle
they
saw
all
round
below
them
wide
prospect
for
the
most
part
lands
empty
and
featureless
except
for
patches
woodland
away
the
south
beyond
which
they
caught
here
and
there
the
glint
distant

Beneath
them
this
southern
side
there
ran
like
ribbon
the
Old
Road
coming
out
the
West
and
winding
and
down
until
faded
behind
ridge
dark
land
the
east
Nothing
was
moving
Following
its
line
eastward
with
their
eyes
they
saw
the
Mountains
the
nearer
foothills
were
brown
and
sombre
behind
them
stood
taller
shapes
grey
and
behind
those
again
were
high
white
peaks
glimmering
among
the
clouds
Well
here
are
said
Merry
And
very
cheerless
and
uninviting
looks
There

And

looking
round
thoughtfully
Even

Suddenly
stooped
and
looked

the

the

The

are

they
certainly
look

But
the

might
mean
something
quite
different
and
have
nothing

Rangers

and
they

sometimes
What
could
they

that

said
Strider
For

There

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
They
stood
for
while
silent
the
hill
top
near
its
south
ward
edge
that
lonely
place
Frodo
for
the
first
time
fully
realized
his
homelessness
and
danger
wished
bitterly
that
his
fortune
had
left
him
the
quiet
and
beloved
Shire
stared
down
the
hateful
Road
leading
back
westward
his
home
Suddenly
was
aware
that
two
black
specks
were
moving
slowly
along
going
westward
and
looking
again
saw
that
three
others
were
creeping
eastward
meet
them
gave
cry
and
clutched
Strider
arm
Look
said
pointing
downwards
once
Strider
flung
himself
the
ground
behind
the
ruined
circle
pulling
Frodo
down
beside
him
Merry
threw
himself
alongside
What
whispered
not
know
but
fear
the
worst
answered
Strider
Slowly
they
crawled
the
edge
the
ring
again
and
peered
through
cleft
between
two
jagged
stones
The
light
was
longer
bright
for
the
clear
morning
had
faded
and
clouds
creeping
out
the
East
had
now
overtaken
the
sun
began
down
They
could
all
see
the
black
specks
but
neither
Frodo
nor
Merry
could
make
out
their
shapes
for
certain
yet
something
told
them
that
there
far
below
were
Black
Riders
assembling
the
Road
beyond
the
foot
the
hill
Yes
said
Strider
whose
keener
sight
left
him
doubt
The
enemy
here
Hastily
they
crept
away
and
slipped
down
the
north
side
the
hill
find
their
companions
Sam
and
Peregrin
had
not
been
idle
They
had
explored
the
small
dell
and
the
surrounding
slopes
Not
far
away
they
found
spring
clear
water
the
hillside
and
near
footprints
not
more
than

two

itself

found
recent

There
were
some

Behind

Sam
viewed
the

with
great
dislike
now
that
had
heard

their
enemies
the
Road
only
few
miles
away
Hadn
better
clear
out
quick
Strider
asked
impatiently
getting
late
and
don
like
this
hole
makes
heart
sink
somehow
Yes
certainly
must
decide
what
once
answered
Strider
looking
and
considering
the
time
and
the
weather
Well
Sam
said

not

but
cannot
think
anywhere

Strider

Peering

The

and
was
slowly
filled
with

Frodo

huddled
round

Strider
was

then
began

softly
The

And

There
Beren
came
from

cold
And
lost
wandered
under

And
where
the

rolled
walked
alone
and
sorrowing
peered
between

And
saw

Enchantment

his

That

And
forth
hastened
strong

And
grasped
moonbeams

Through

She
lightly
fled

And
left

the

oft
the

Now
withered
lay
the

And
one

with

Whispering
fell
the

wavering
sought
her

Where

Her

When

again
And
her

released
the

Like
rising

And
melting

bubbling
saw
the

THE

Again
she
fled
but
swift
came
Tiniwiel
Tiniwiel

her

And
there
she
halted
listening
One
moment
stood
she
and
spell
His

laid
her
Beren
came
And
doom
fell
Tiniwiel
That
his

lay
glistening
Beren
looked
into

Within

The

Tiniwiel
the

Immortal
maiden
elven

About
him
cast
her

And
arms
like

Long
was
the
way
that
fate
them
bore
stony
mountains
cold
and
grey
Through
halls
iron
and
darkling
door
And
woods
nightshade
morrowless
The
Sundering

between
them
lay
And
yet
last
they
met
once
more
And
long
ago
they
passed
away
the
forest
singing
sorrowless
Strider
sighed
and
paused
before
spoke
again

Luthien

But
the

and
Beren
escaping

came
over
the

Terror
into
the

Thingol
the

Neldoreth
There
beheld
Luthien

named
her
Tinuviel
that

Many
sorrows
befell
them
afterwards
and
they
were
parted
long
Tinuviel
rescued
Beren
from
the
dungeons
Sauron
and
together
they
passed
through
great
dangers
and
cast
down
even
the

Yet
the

Beren
was
slain
the

that
came
from

Angband
and
died
the

Tinuviel
But
she
chose
mortality
and
die
from
the
world
that
she
might
follow
him
and
sung
that
they
met
again
beyond
the

and
after

alive
once

the

they

But

The

but
Frodo
felt
cold
dread
creeping
over
his
heart
now
that
Strider
was
longer
speaking
huddled
closer
the
fire
that
moment
Sam
came
running
back
from
the
edge
the
dell
don
know
what
said
but
suddenly
felt
afraid
durstn
outside
this
dell
for
any
money
felt
that
some
thing
was
creeping
the
slope
Did
you
see
anything
asked
Frodo
springing
his
feet
sir
saw
nothing
but
didn
stop
look
saw
something
said
Merry
thought
did
away
westwards
where
the
moonlight
was
falling
the
flats
beyond
the
shadow
the
hill
tops
thought
there
were
two
three
black
shapes
They
seemed
moving
this
way
Keep
close
the
fire
with
your
faces
outward
cried
Strider
Get
some
the
longer
sticks
ready
your
hands
For
breathless
time
they
sat
there
silent
and
alert
with
their
backs
turned
the
wood
fire
each
gazing
into
the
shadows
that
encircled
them
Nothing
happened
There
was
sound
movement
the
night
Frodo
stirred
feeling
that
must
break
the
silence
longed
shout
out
aloud
Hush
whispered
Strider
What
that
gasped
Pippin
the
same
moment
KNIFE
THE
DARK
255
Over
the
lip
the
little
dell
the
side
away
from
the
hill
they
felt
rather
than
saw
shadow
rise
one
shadow
more
than
one
They
strained
their
eyes
and
the
shadows
seemed
grow
Soon
there
could
doubt
three
four
tall
black
figures
were
standing
there
the
slope
looking
down
them
black
were
they
that
they
seemed
like
black
holes
the
deep
shade
behind
them
Frodo
thought
that
heard
faint
hiss
venomous
breath
and
felt
thin
piercing
chill
Then
the
shapes
slowly
advanced
Terror
overcame
Pippin
and
Merry
and
they
threw
them
selves
flat
the
ground
Sam
shrank
Frodo
side
Frodo
was
hardly
less
terrified
than
his
companions
was
quaking
was
bitter
cold
but
his
terror
was
swallowed
sudden
temptation
put
the
Ring
The
desire
this
laid
hold
him
and
could
think
nothing
else
did
not
forget
the
Barrow
nor
the
message
Gandalf
but
something
seemed
compelling
him
disregard
all
warnings
and
longed
yield
Not
with
the
hope
escape
doing
anything
either
good
bad
simply
felt
that
must
take
the
Ring
and
put
his
finger
could
not
speak
felt
Sam
looking
him
knew
that
his
master
was
some
great
trouble
but
could
not
turn
towards
him
shut
his
eyes
and
struggled
for
while
but
resistance
became
unbearable
and
last
slowly
drew
out
the
chain
and
slipped
the
Ring
the
forefinger
his
left
hand
Immediately
though
everything
else
remained
before
dim
and
dark
the
shapes
became
terribly
clear
was
able
see
beneath
their
black
wrappings
There
were
five
tall
figures
two
standing
the
lip
the
dell
three
advancing
their
white
faces
burned
keen
and
merciless
eyes
under
their
mantles
were
long
grey
robes
upon
their
grey
hairs
were
helms
silver
their
haggard
hands
were
swords
steel
Their
eyes
fell
him
and
pierced
him
they
rushed
towards
him
Desperate
drew
his
own
sword
and
seemed
him
that
flickered
red
was
firebrand
Two
the
figures
halted
The
third
was
taller
than
the
others

his

was

and

and
his

one
hand
held

and
the

both
the

and
the
hand
that
held
glowed
with
pale
light
sprang
forward
and
bore
down
Frodo
that
moment
Frodo
threw
himself
forward
the

and
heard
himself
crying
aloud
Elbereth

the
same
time
struck
the
feet
his
enemy
shrill
cry
rang
out
the
night
and
felt

his

Even

caught
through

Strider
leaping
out
the
darkness
with

With

Frodo
dropping

from

FLIGHT
THE
FORD
When
Frodo
came
himself
was
still
clutching
the
Ring
desperately
was
lying
the
fire
which
was
now
piled
high
and
burning
brightly
His
three
companions
were
bend
ing
over
him
What
has
happened
Where
the
pale
king
asked
wildly
They
were
too
overjoyed
hear
him
speak
answer
for
while
nor
did
they
understand
his
question
length
gathered
from
Sam
that
they
had
seen
nothing
but
the
vague
shadowy
shapes
coming
towards
them
Suddenly
his
horror
Sam
found
that
his
master
had
vanished
and
that
moment
black
shadow
rushed
past
him
and
fell
heard
Frodo
voice
but
seemed
come
from
great
distance
from
under
the
earth
crying
out
strange
words
They
saw
nothing
more
until
they
stumbled
over
the
body
Frodo
lying
dead
face
downwards
the
grass
with
his
sword
beneath
him
Strider
ordered
them
pick
him
and
lay
him
near
the
fire
and
then
disappeared
That
was
now
good
while
ago
Sam
plainly
was
beginning
have
doubts
again
about
Strider
but
while
they
were
talking
returned
appearing
suddenly
out
the
shadows
They
started
and
Sam
drew
his
sword
and
stood
over
Frodo
but
Strider
knelt
down
swiftly
his
side
not

When

and
shook
his
head
and
sighed
Then
ordered
Pippin
and
Merry
heat
much
water
they
could
their
small
kettles
and
bathe
the
wound
with
Keep

Then

and

and
called

There

they

but
don

They
have
drawn
off
for
the
time

But
not
far
fear
They
will
come
again
another
night
cannot
escape
They
are
only
waiting
because
they
think
that
their
purpose
almost
accomplished
and
that
the
Ring
cannot
fly

further
fear
Sam
that
they
believe
your
master
has
deadly
wound
that
will
subdue
him
their

Sam

with
tears
Don
despair
said
Strider
You
must
trust
now
Your
Frodo
made
sterner
stuff
than
had
guessed
though
Gandalf
hinted
that
might
prove
not
slain
and
think
will
resist
the
evil
power
the
wound
longer
than
his
enemies
expect
will
all
can
help
and
heal
him
Guard
him
well
while
away
hurried
off
and
disappeared
again
into
the
darkness
Frodo
dozed
though
the
pain
his
wound
was
slowly
growing
and
deadly
chill
was
spreading
from
his
shoulder
his
arm
and
side
His
friends
watched
over
him
warming
him
and
bathing
his
wound
The
night
passed
slowly
and
wearily
Dawn
was
growing
the
sky
and
the
dell
was
filling
with
grey
light
when
Strider
last
returned
Look
cried
and
stooping
lifted
from
the
ground
black
cloak
that
had
lain
there
hidden
the
darkness
foot
above
the
lower

there
was

This
was

and
lifted
long
thin
knife
There
was
cold
gleam
Strider
raised
they
saw
that
near
the
end
its
edge
was
notched
and
the
point
was
broken
off
But
even
held
the
growing
light
they
gazed
astonishment
for
the
blade
seemed
melt
and
vanished
like
smoke
the
air
leaving
only
the
hilt
Strider
hand
Alas
cried
was
this
accursed
knife
that
gave
the
wound
Few
now
have
the
skill

match
such
evil
weapons
But
will
what
can
sat
down
the
ground
and
taking
the
dagger
hilt
laid
his
knees
and
sang
over
slow
song
strange
tongue
Then
setting
aside
turned
Frodo
and
soft
tone
spoke
words
the
others
could
not
catch
From
the
pouch
his
belt
drew
out
the
long
leaves
plant
These
leaves
said
have
walked
far

for
this
plant
does
not
grow
the
bare
hills
but
the
thickets
away
south
the

found
the
dark
the
scent
its
leaves
crushed
leaf
his
fingers
and
gave
out
sweet
and
pungent
fragrance
fortunate
that
could
find
for
healing

that
the

the
Wild

but
over
such

threw
the
leaves
into

and
bathed
Frodo
shoulder
The
fragrance
the
steam
was
refreshing
and
those
that
were
unhurt
felt
their
minds
calmed
and
cleared
The

had
also
some

for
Frodo

and
also

perceived
that
putting

THE

THE

now

their

felt
too
weak

The
others
were
discussing
this
very
question
They
quickly
decided
leave
Weathertop
soon
possible
think
now
said
Strider
that
the
enemy
has
been
watching
this
place
for
some
days
Gandalf
ever
came
here
then
must
have
been
forced
ride
away
and
will
not
return
any
case
are
great
peril
here
after
dark
since
the
attack
last
night
and
can
hardly
meet
greater
danger
wherever
soon
the
daylight
was
full
they
had
some
hurried
food
and
packed
was
impossible
for
Frodo
walk
they
divided
the
greater
part
their
baggage
among
the
four
them
and
put
Frodo
the
pony
the
last
few
days
the
poor
beast
had
improved
wonderfully
already
seemed
fat
ter
and
stronger
and
had
begun
show
affection
for
its
new
masters
especially
for
Sam
Bill
Ferny
treatment
must
have
been
very
hard
for
the
journey
the
wild
seem
much
better
than
its
former
life
They
started
off
southerly
direction
This
would
mean
crossing
the
Road
but
was
the
quickest
way
more
wooded
country
And
they
needed
fuel
for
Strider
said
that
Frodo
must
kept
warm
especially
night
while
fire
would
some
protection
for
them
all
was
also
his
plan
shorten
their
journey
cutting
across
another
great
loop
the
Road
east
beyond
Weathertop
changed
its
course
and
took
wide
bend
northwards
They
made
their
way
slowly
and
cautiously
round
the
south
western
slopes
the
hill
and
came
little
while
the
edge
the
Road
There
was
sign
the

But
even
they
were
hurrying
across
they
heard
far
away
two
cries
cold
voice
calling
and
cold
voice
answering
Trem

they
sprang
forward
and
made
for
the
thickets
that
lay
ahead
The
land
before
them
sloped
away
southwards
but
was
wild
and
pathless
bushes
and
stunted
trees
grew
dense
patches
with
wide
barren
spaces
between
The

26l
scanty
coarse
and
grey
and
the
leaves
the
thickets
were
faded
and
falling
was
cheerless
land
and
their
journey
was
slow
and
gloomy
They
spoke
little
they
trudged
along
Frodo
heart
was
grieved
watched
them
walking
beside
him
with
their
heads
down
and
their
backs
bowed
under
their
burdens
Even
Strider
seemed
tired
and
heavy
hearted
Before
the
first
day
march
was
over
Frodo
pain
began
grow
again
but
did
not
speak
for
long
time
Four
days
passed
without
the
ground
the
scene
changing
much
except
that
behind
them
Weathertop
slowly
sank
and
before
them
the
distant
mountains
loomed
little
nearer
Yet
since
that
far
cry
they
had
seen
and
heard
sign
that
the
enemy
had
marked
their
flight
followed
them
They
dreaded
the
dark
hours
and
kept
watch
pairs
night
expecting
any
time
see
black
shapes
stalking
the
grey
night
dimly
lit
the
cloud
veiled
moon
but
they
saw
nothing
and
heard
sound
but
the
sigh
withered
leaves
and
grass
Not
once
did
they
feel
the
sense
present
evil
that
had
assailed
them
before
the
attack
the
dell
seemed
too
much
hope
that
the
Riders
had
already
lost
their
trail
again
Perhaps
they
were
waiting
make
some
ambush
narrow
place
the
end
the
fifth
day
the
ground
began
once
more
rise
slowly
out
the
wide
shallow
valley
into
which
they
had
descended
Strider
now
turned
their
course
again
north
eastwards
and
the
sixth
day
they
reached
the
top
long
slow
climbing
slope
and
saw
far
ahead
huddle
wooded
hills
Away
below
them
they
could
see
the
Road
sweeping
round
the
feet
the
hills
and
their
right
grey
river
gleamed
pale
the
thin

the
distance
they

Next
day
early
the
morning
they
came
down
again
the
borders
the

Sam
and
Strider
went
forward
but
they
found
sign
any
travellers
riders
Here
under
the
shadow
the
hills
there
had
been
some
rain
Strider
judged
that
had
fallen
two
days
before
and
had
washed
away
all
footprints
horseman
had
passed
since
then
far
could
see
They
hurried
along
with
all
the
speed
they
could
make
and
after
mile
two
they
saw
the
Last
Bridge
ahead
the
bottom
short
steep
slope
They
dreaded
see
black
figures
waiting
there
but
they
saw
none
Strider
made
them
take
cover

the
side
the
Road
while
went
forward
explore
Before
long
came

once
they
went
again
They
crossed
the
Bridge
safety
hearing
sound
but
the
water
swirling
against
its
three
great
arches
mile
further
they
came
narrow
ravine
that
led
away
northwards
through
the
steep
lands
the
left
the
Road
Here
Strider
turned
aside
and
soon
they
were
lost
sombre
country
dark
trees
winding
among
the
feet
sullen
hills
The
hobbits
were
glad
leave
the
cheerless
lands
and
the
perilous
Road
behind
them
but
this
new
country
seemed
threatening
and
unfriendly
they
went
forward
the
hills
about
them
steadily
rose
Here
and
there
upon
heights
and
ridges
they
caught
glimpses
ancient
walls
stone
and
the
ruins
towers
they
had
ominous
look
Frodo
who
was
not
walking
had
time
gaze
ahead
and
think
recalled
Bilbo
account
his
journey
and
the
threatening
towers
the
hills
north
the
Road
the
country
near
the
Trolls
wood
where
his
first
serious
adventure
had
happened
Frodo
guessed
that
they
were
now
the
same
region
and
wondered
chance
they
would
pass
near
the
spot
Who
lives
this
land
asked
And
who
built
these
towers
this
troll
country
said
Strider
Trolls
not

They

But
all
were
destroyed
the

that

But
that
now
long

that
the

have
forgotten
them

Where
did

Elrond
The
hills
now
began
shut
them
The
Road
behind
held
its
way
the
River
Bruinen
but
both
were
now
hidden
from
view
The
travellers
came
into
long
valley
narrow
deeply
cloven
dark
and
silent
Trees
with
old
and
twisted
roots
hung
over
cliffs
and
piled
behind
into
mounting
slopes
pine
wood
The
hobbits
grew
very
weary
They
advanced
slowly
for
they
had
pick
their
way
through
pathless
country
encum
bered
fallen
trees
and
tumbled
rocks
long
they
could
they
avoided
climbing
for
Frodo
sake
and
because
was
fact
difficult
find
any
way
out
the
narrow
dales
They
had
been
two
days
this
country
when
the
weather
turned
wet
The
wind
began
blow
steadily
out
the
West
and
pour
the
water
the
distant
seas
the
dark
heads
the
hills
fine
drenching
rain
nightfall
they
were
all
soaked
and
their
camp
was
cheerless
for
they
could
not
get
any
fire
burn
The
next
day
the
hills
rose
still
higher
and
steeper
before
them
and
they
were
forced
turn
away
north
wards
out
their
course
Strider
seemed
getting
anxi
ous
they
were
nearly
ten
days
out
from
Weathertop
and
their
stock
provisions
was
beginning
run
low
went
raining
That
night
they
camped
stony
shelf
with
rock
wall
behind
them
which
there
was
shallow
cave
mere
scoop
the
cliff
Frodo
was
restless
The
cold
and
wet
had
made
his
wound
more
painful
than
ever
and
the
ache
and
sense
deadly
chill
took
away
all
sleep
lay
tossing
and
turning
and
listening
fearfully
the
stealthy
night
noises
wind
chinks
rock
water
dripping
crack
the
sudden
rattling
fall
loosened
stone
felt
that
black
shapes
were
advancing
smother
him
but
when
sat
saw
nothing
but
the
back
Strider
sitting
hunched
smoking
his
pipe
and
watching
lay
down
again
and
passed
into
uneasy
dream
which
walked
the
grass
his
garden
the
FLIGHT

Shire
but
seemed
faint
and
dim
less
clear
than
the
tall
black
shadows
that
stood
looking
over
the
hedge
the
morning
woke
find
that
the
rain
had
stopped
The
clouds
were
still
thick
but
they
were
breaking
and
pale
strips
blue
appeared
between
them
The
wind
was
shifting
again
They
did
not
start
early
Immediately
after
their
cold
and
comfortless
breakfast
Strider
went
off
alone
telling
the
others
remain
under
the
shelter
the
cliff
until
came

going

When

Rivendell
That
troll
country
and
little
known
could
per
haps
find
our
way
through
and
come
round
Rivendell
from
the
north
but
would
take
too
long
for
not
know
the
way
and
our
food
would
not
last
somehow
other
must
find
the
Ford
Bruinen
The
rest
that
day
they
spent
scrambling
over
rocky
ground
They
found
passage
between
two
hills
that
led
them
into
valley
running
south
east
the
direction
that
they
wished
take
but
towards
the
end
the
day
they
found
their
road
again
barred
ridge
high
land
its
dark
edge
against
the
sky
was
broken
into
many
bare
points
like
teeth
blunted
saw
They
had
choice
between
going
back
climbing
over
They
decided
attempt
the
climb
but
proved
very
difficult
Before
long
Frodo
was
obliged
dismount
and
struggle
along
foot
Even
they
often
despaired
getting
their
pony
indeed
finding
path
for
themselves
burdened
they
were
The
light
was
nearly
gone
and
they
were
all
exhausted
when
last
they
reached
the
top
They
had
climbed
narrow
saddle
between
two
higher
points
and
the
land
fell
steeply
away
again
only
short
distance
ahead
Frodo
threw
himself
down
and
lay
the
ground

THE

shivering
His
left
arm
was
lifeless
and
his
side
and
shoulder
felt
icy
claws
were
laid
upon
them
The
trees
and
rocks
about
him
seemed
shadowy

Merry
Strider

this
has
been

much
for

dreadfully
anxious
about

What

answered
Strider
There
nothing

chiefly
because

But
agree
that

What

asked
Sam
low

looking
appealingly
Strider
His

was
small
and
already
closed
There
nothing

his

Frodo

Strider

there
some

But
not

Sam
Night
was
cold
the
high
ridge
They
lit
small
fire
down
under
the
gnarled
roots
old
pine
that
hung
over
shallow
pit
looked
stone
had
once
been
quarried
there
They
sat
huddled
together
The
wind
blew
chill
through
the
pass
and
they
heard
the
tree
tops
lower
down
moaning
and
sighing
Frodo
lay
half
dream
imagining
that
endless
dark
wings
were
sweeping
above
him
and
that
the
wings
rode
pursuers
that
sought
him
all
the
hollows
the
hills
The
morning
dawned
bright
and
fair
the
air
was
clean
and
the
light
pale
and
clear
rain
washed
sky
Their
hearts
were
encouraged
but
they
longed
for
the
sun
warm
their
cold
stiff
limbs
soon
was
light
Strider
took
Merry
with
him
and
went
survey
the
country
from
the
height
the
east
the
pass
The
sun
had
risen
and
was
shining
brightly
when
returned
with
more
comforting
news
They
were
now
going

they

went
down
the
further
side
the
ridge
they
would
have
the
Mountains
their
left
Some
way
ahead
Strider
had
caught
glimpse
the
Loudwater
again
and
knew
that
though
was
hidden
from
view
the
Road
the
Ford
was
not
far
from
the
River
and
lay
the
side
nearest
them
must
make
for
the
Road
again
said
cannot
hope
find
path
through
these
hills
Whatever
danger
may
beset
the
Road
our
only
way
the
Ford
soon
they
had
eaten
they
set
out
again
They
climbed
slowly
down
the
southern
side
the
ridge
but
the
way
was
much
easier
than
they
had
expected
for
the
slope
was
far
less
steep
this
side
and
before
long
Frodo
was
able
ride
again
Bill
Ferny
poor
old
pony
was
developing
unexpected
talent
for
picking
out
path
and
for
sparing
its
rider
many
jolts
possible
The
spirits
the
party
rose
again
Even
Frodo
felt
better
the
morning
light
but
every
now
and
again
mist
seemed
obscure
his
sight
and
passed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
Pippin
was
little
ahead
the
others
Suddenly
turned
round
and
called
them
There
path
here
cried
When
they
came
with
him
they
saw
that
had
made
mistake
there
were
clearly
the
beginnings
path
that
climbed
with
many
windings
out
the
woods
below
and
faded
away
the
hill
top
behind
places
was
now
faint
and
overgrown
choked
with
fallen
stones
and
trees
but
one
time
seemed
have
been
much
used
was
path
made
strong
arms
and
heavy
feet
Here
and
there
old
trees
had
been
cut
broken
down
and
large
rocks
cloven
heaved
aside
make
way
They
followed
the
track
for
some
while
for
offered
much
the
easiest
way
down
but
they
went
cautiously
and
their
anxiety
increased
they
came
into
the
dark
woods
and
the
path
grew
plainer
and
broader
Suddenly
coming
out
belt
fir
trees
ran
steeply
down
slope
and
turned
sharply
the
left
round
the
corner
rocky
shoulder
the

THE

THE

When
they
came
the
corner
they
looked
round
and
saw
that
the
path
ran
over
level
strip
under
the
face
low
cliff
overhung
with
trees
the
stony
wall
there
was
door
hanging
crookedly
ajar
upon
one
great
hinge
Outside
the
door
they
all
halted
There
was
cave
rock
chamber
behind
but
the
gloom
inside
nothing
could
seen
Strider
Sam
and
Merry
pushing
with
all
their
strength
managed
open
the
door
little
wider
and
then
Strider
and
Merry
went
They
did
not
far
for
the
floor
lay
many
old
bones
and
nothing
else
was
seen
near
the
entrance
except
some
great
empty
jars
and
broken
pots
Surely
this
troll
hole
ever
there
was
one
said
Pippin
Come
out
you
two
and
let
get
away
Now
know
who
made
the
path
and
had
better
get
off
quick
There
need
think
said
Strider
coming
out
certainly
troll
hole
but
seems
have
been
long
forsaken
don
think
need
afraid
But
let
down
warily
and
shall
see
The
path
went
again
from
the
door
and
turning
the
right
again
across
the
level
space
plunged
down
thick
wooded
slope
Pippin
not
liking
show
Strider
that
was
still
afraid
went
ahead
with
Merry
Sam
and
Strider
came
behind
one
each
side
Frodo
pony
for
the
path
was
now
broad
enough
for
four
five
hobbits
walk
abreast
But
they
had
not
gone
very
far
before
Pippin
came
running
back
followed
Merry
They
both
looked
terrified
There
are
trolls
Pippin
panted
Down
clearing
the
woods
not
far
below
got
sight
them
through
the
tree
trunks
They
are
very
large
will
come
and
look
them
said
Strider
picking
stick
Frodo
said
nothing
but
Sam
looked
scared
The
sun
was
now
high
and
shone
down
through
the
half
stripped
branches
the
trees
and
lit
the
clearing
with
bright
patches
light
They
halted
suddenly
the
edge
and
peered
through
the
tree
trunks
holding
their
breath
FLIGHT
THE
FORD
269
There
stood
the
trolls
three
large
trolls
One
was
stooping
and
the
other
two
stood
staring
him
Strider
walked
forward
unconcernedly
Get
old
stone
said
and
broke
his
stick
upon
the
stooping
troll
Nothing
happened
There
was
gasp
astonishment
from
the
hobbits
and
then
even
Frodo
laughed
Well
said

forgetting
our
family
history
These
must
the
very
three
that
were
caught
Gandalf
quarrelling
over
the
right
way

thirteen
dwarves
and
one
hobbit
had
idea

anywhere
near

said
Pippin
knew
the
story
well
Bilbo
and
Frodo
had
told
often
but
matter
fact
had
never
more
than
half
believed
Even
now
looked
the
stone
trolls
with
sus
picion
wondering
some
magic
might
not
suddenly
bring
them
life
again
You
are
forgetting
not
only
your
family
history
but
all
you
ever
knew
about

Strider
broad

with

and
yet
you
come

trying

with

waiting
for

any

that

That

They
all

Frodo

his

Bilbo
first
successful

was
heartening
The

too
was
warm

comforting
and
the

for

that
Gandalf
Bilbo

before
After

they
came

they
could
see
the
Road
faint
and
grey
the
failing
light
some
thirty
feet
below
them
The
sound
hoofs
drew
nearer
They
were
going
fast
with
light
clippety
clippety
clip
Then
faintly
was
blown
away
from
them
the
breeze
they
seemed
catch
dim
ringing
small
bells
tinkling
That
does
not
sound
like
Black
Rider
horse
said
Frodo
listening
intently
The
other
hobbits
agreed
hopefully
that
did
not
but
they
all
remained
full
suspicion
They
had
been
fear
pursuit
for
long
that
any
sound
from
behind
seemed
ominous
and
unfriendly
But
Strider
was
now
leaning
forward
stooped
the
ground
with
hand
his
ear
and
look
joy
his
face
The
light
faded
and
the
leaves
the
bushes
rustled
softly
Clearer
and
nearer
now
the
bells
jingled
and
clippety
clip
came
the
quick
trotting
feet
Suddenly
into
view
below
came
white
horse
gleaming
the
shadows
running
swiftly
the
dusk
its
headstall
flickered
and
flashed
were
stud
ded
with
gems
like
living
stars
The
rider
cloak
streamed
behind
him
and
his
hood
was
thrown
back
his
golden
hair
flowed
shimmering
the
wind
his
speed
Frodo
appeared
that
white
light
was
shining
through
the
form
and
raiment
the
rider
through
thin
veil
Strider
sprang
from
hiding
and
dashed
down
towards
the
Road
leaping
with
cry
through
the
heather
but
even
before
had
moved
called
the
rider
had
reined
his
horse
and
halted
looking
towards
the
thicket
where
they
stood
When
saw
Strider
dismounted
and
ran
meet
him
calling
out
vedui
Dunadan
Mae
govannen
His
speech
and
clear
ringing
voice
left
doubt
their
hearts
the
rider
was
the
Elven
folk
others
that
dwelt
the
wide
world
had
voices
fair
hear
But
there
seemed
note
haste
fear
his
call
and
they
saw
that
was
now
speaking
quickly
and
urgently
Strider
Soon
Strider
beckoned
them
and
the
hobbits
left
the

THE

the
ring
bushes
and
hurried
down
the
Road
This
Glorfindel
who
dwells
the
house
Elrond
said
Strider
Hail
and
well
met
last
said
the
Elf
lord
Frodo
was
sent
from
Rivendell
look
for
you
feared
that
you
were
danger
upon
the
road
Then
Gandalf
has
reached
Rivendell
cried
Frodo
joyfully
had
not
when
departed
but
that
was
nine
days
ago
answered
Glorfindel
Elrond
received
news
that
troubled
him
Some
kindred
journeying
your
land
beyond
the
Baranduin
learned
that
things
were
amiss
and
sent
messages
swiftly
they
could
They
said
that
the
Nine
were
abroad
and
that
you
were
astray
bearing
great
burden
without
guidance
for
Gandalf
had
not
returned
There
are
few
even
Rivendell
that
can
ride
openly
against
the
Nine
but
such
there
were
Elrond
sent
out
north
west
and
south
was
thought
that
you
might
turn
far
aside
avoid
pursuit
and
become
lost
the
Wilderness
was
lot
take
the
Road
and
came
the
Bridge
Mitheithel
and
left
token
there
nigh
seven
days
ago
Three
the
servants
Sauron
were
upon
the
Bridge
but
they
withdrew
and
pursued
them
westward
came
also
upon
two
others
but
they
turned
away
southward
Since
then
have
searched
for
your
trail
Two
days
ago
found
and
followed
over
the
Bridge
and
today
marked
where
you
descended
from
the
hills
again
But
come
There
time
for
further
news
Since
you
are
here
must
risk
the
peril
the
Road
and
There
are
five
behind
and
when
they
find
your
trail
upon
the
Road
they
will
ride
after
like
the
wind
And
they
are
not
all
Where
the
other
four
may
not
know
fear
that
may
find
the
Ford
already
held
against
While
Glorfindel
was
speaking
the
shades
evening
deep
ened
Frodo
felt
great
weariness
come
over
him
Ever
since
the
sun
began
sink
the
mist
before
his
eyes
had
darkened
The
Brandywine
River
FLIGHT

275
and
felt
that
shadow
was
coming
between
him
and
the
faces
his
friends
Now
pain
assailed
him
and
felt
cold
swayed
clutching
Sam
arm
master
sick
and
wounded
said
Sam
angrily
can

after
nightfall
needs
rest
Glorhndel
caught
Frodo
sank
the
ground
and
taking
him
gently
his
arms
looked
his
face
with
grave
anxiety
Briefly
Strider
told
the
attack
their
camp
under
Weathertop
and
the
deadly
knife
drew
out
the
hilt
which
had
kept
and
handed
the
Elf
Glorfindel
shuddered
took
but
looked
intently
There
are
evil
things
written
this
hilt
said
though
maybe
your
eyes
cannot
see
them
Keep
Aragorn
till

But
wary
and
handle

you
may
Alas
the
wounds
this

can
but
all
the

now
without

searched
the

Frodo
shoulder
with
his
fingers
and
his
face
grew
graver
what
learned
dis
quieted
him
But
Frodo
felt
the
chill
lessen
his
side
and
arm
little
warmth
crept
down
from
his
shoulder
his
hand
and
the
pain
grew
easier
The
dusk
evening
seemed
grow
lighter
about
him
cloud
had
been
withdrawn
saw
his
friends
faces
more
clearly
again
and
measure
new
hope
and
strength
returned
You

Glorfindel

had

and
was
persuaded
mount
Glorfindel
white
horse
The
pony
was
laden
instead
with
great
part
the
others
burdens
that
they
now
marched
lighter
and
for
time
made
good
speed
but
the
hobbits
began
find
hard
keep
with
the
swift
tireless
feet
the
Elf
led
them
into
the
mouth
darkness
and
still
under
the
deep
clouded
night
There
was
neither
star
nor
moon
Not
until
the
grey
dawn
did
allow
them
halt
Pippin
Merry
and
Sam
were
that
time
nearly
asleep
their
stumbling
legs
and
even
Strider
seemed
the
sag
his
shoulders
weary
Frodo
sat
upon
the
horse
dark
dream
They
cast
themselves
down
the
heather
few
yards
from
the
road
side
and
fell
asleep
immediately
They
seemed
hardly
have
closed
their
eyes
when
Glorfindel
who
had
set
himself
watch
while
they
slept
awoke
them
again
The
sun
had
now
climbed
far
into
the
morning
and
the
clouds
and
mists
the
night
were
gone
Drink
this
said
Glorfindel
them
pouring
for
each
turn
little
liquor
from
his
silver
studded
flask
leather
was
clear
spring
water
and
had
taste
and
did
not
feel
either
cool
warm
the
mouth
but
strength
and
vigour
seemed
flow
into
all
their
limbs
they
drank
Eaten
after
that
draught
the
stale
bread
and
dried
fruit
which
was
now
all
that
they
had
left
seemed
satisfy
their
hunger
better
than
many
good
breakfast
the
Shire
had
done
They
had
rested
rather
less
than
five
hours
when
they
took
the
Road
again
Glorfindel
still
urged
them
and
only
allowed
two
brief
halts
during
the
day
march
this
way
they
covered
almost
twenty
miles
before
nightfall
and
came
point
where
the

bent
right
and
ran
down
towards

277
the
bottom
the
valley
now
making
straight
for
the
Bruinen
far
there
had
been
sign
sound
pursuit
that
the
hobbits
could
see
hear
but
often
Glorfindel
would
halt
and
listen
for
moment
they
lagged
behind
and
look
anxiety
clouded
his
face
Once
twice
spoke
Strider
the
elf
tongue
But
however
anxious
their
guides
might
was
plain
that
the
hobbits
could
further
that
night
They
were
stumbling
along
dizzy
with
weariness
and
unable
think
anything
but
their
feet
and
legs
Frodo
pain
had
redoubled
and
during
the
day
things
about
him
faded
shadows
ghostly
grey
Fie
almost
welcomed
the
coming
night
for
then
the
world
seemed
less
pale
and
empty
The
hobbits
were
still
weary
when
they
set
out
again
early
next
morning
There
were
many
miles
yet
between
them
and
the
Ford
and
they
hobbled
forward
the
best
pace
they
could
manage
Our
peril
will
greatest
just
ere
reach
the
river
said
Glorfindel
for
heart
warns
that
the
pursuit
now
swift
behind
and
other
danger
may
waiting
the
Ford
The
Road
was
still
running
steadily
downhill
and
there
was
now
places
much
grass
either
side
which
the
hobbits
walked
when
they
could
ease
their
tired
feet
the
late
afternoon
they
came
place
where
the
Road
went
suddenly
under
the
dark
shadow
tall
pine
trees
and
then
plunged
into
deep
cutting
with
steep
moist
walls
red
stone
Echoes
ran
along
they
hurried
forward
and
there
seemed
sound
many
footfalls
following
their
own
All
once
through
gate
light
the
Road
ran
out
again
from
the
end
the
tunnel
into
the
open
There
the
bottom
sharp
incline
they
saw
before
them
long
flat
mile
and
beyond
that
the
Ford
Rivendell
the
further
side
was
steep
brown
bank
threaded
winding
path
and
behind
that
the
tall
mountains
climbed
shoulder

into

THE

There
was
still
echo
following
feet
the
cutting
behind
them
rushing
noise
wind
were
rising
and
pouring
through
the
branches
the
pines
One
moment
Glorfmdel
turned
and
listened
then
sprang
forward
with
loud
cry
Fly
called
Fly
The
enemy
upon
The
white
horse
leaped
forward
The
hobbits
ran
down
the
slope
Glorfmdel
and
Strider
followed
rearguard
They
were
only
half
way
across
the
flat
when
suddenly
there
was
noise
horses
galloping
Out
the
gate
the
trees
that
they
had
just
left
rode
Black
Rider
reined
his
horse
and
halted
swaying
his
saddle
Another
followed
him
and
then
another
then
again
two
more

cried
Glorfindel
Frodo
did
not
obey
once
for
strange
reluctance
seized
him
Checking
the
horse
walk
turned
and
looked
back
The
Riders
seemed
sit
upon
their
great
steeds
like
threatening
statues
upon
hill
dark
and
solid
while
all
the
woods
and
land
about
them
receded
into
mist
Sud
denly
knew
his
heart
that
they
were
silently
command
ing
him
wait
Then
once
fear
and
hatred
awoke
him
His
hand
left
the
bridle
and
gripped
the
hilt
his
sword
and
with
red
flash
drew

cried
Glorfmdel
and
then
loud
and
clear
called

Asfaloth
once
the
white
horse
sprang
away
and
sped
like
the
wind
along
the
last
lap
the
Road
the
same
moment
the
black
horses
leaped
down
the

pursuit
and
from
the
Riders
came
terrible
cry
such
Frodo
had
heard
filling
the
woods
with
horror
the

far
away
was
answered
and
the

out
from

and

away

four
other

came
flying
Two

madly

Frodo
looked
back
for
moment
over
his
shoulder
could
longer
see
his
friends
The
Riders
behind
were
falling
back
even
their
great
steeds
were
match
speed
for
the
white
elf
horse
Glorfindel
looked
forward
again
and
hope
faded
There
seemed
chance
reaching
the
Ford
before
was
cut
off
the
others
that
had
lain
ambush
could
see
them
clearly
now
they
appeared
have
cast
aside
their
hoods
and
black
cloaks
and
they
were
robed
white
and
grey
Swords
were
naked
their
pale
hands
helms
were
their
heads
Their
cold
eyes
glittered
and
they
called
him
with
fell
voices
Fear
now
filled
all
Frodo
mind
thought
longer
his
sword
cry
came
from
him
shut
his
eyes
and
clung
the
horse
mane
The
wind
whistled
his
ears
and
the
bells
upon
the
harness
rang
wild
and
shrill
breath
deadly
cold
pierced
him
like
spear
with
last
spurt
like
flash
white
fire
the
elf
horse
speeding
wings
passed
right
before
the
face
the

Rider
Frodo
heard
the
splash
water
foamed
about
his
feet
felt
the
quick
heave
and
surge
the
horse
left
the
river
and
struggled
the
stony
path
was
climbing
the
steep
bank
was
across
the
Ford
But
the
pursuers
were
close
behind
the
top
the
bank
the
horse
halted
and
turned
about
neighing
fiercely
There
were
Nine
Riders
the
water
edge
below
and
Frodo
spirit
quailed
before
the
threat
their
uplifted
faces
knew
nothing
that
would
prevent
them
from
crossing
easily
had
done
and
felt
that
was
useless

over
the
long
uncertain
path
from

the

Rivendell
once
the
Riders
crossed
any

felt
that
was

urgently
halt
Hatred
again
stirred
him
but
had

the

Suddenly
the
foremost
Rider
spurred
his
horse
forward
checked
the

and
reared
With
great

sounded

his

The

halted

laughed
him
with
harsh
and
chilling
laughter

cried
with

their

urged
his

forward

Then
the
leader
who
was
now
half
across
the
Ford
stood
menacing
his
stirrups
and
raised
his
hand
Frodo
was
stricken
dumb
felt
his
tongue
cleave
his
mouth
and
his
heart
labouring
His
sword
broke
and
fell
out
his
shaking
hand
The
elf
horse
reared
and
snorted
The
foremost
the
black
horses
had
almost
set
foot
upon
the
shore
that
moment
there
came
roaring
and
rushing
noise
loud
waters
rolling
many
stones
Dimly
Frodo
saw
the
river
below
him
rise
and
down
along
its
course
there
came
plumed
cavalry
waves
White
flames
seemed
Frodo
flicker
their
crests
and
half
fancied
that
saw
amid
the
water
white
riders
upon
white
horses
with
frothing
manes
The
three
Riders
that
were
still
the
midst
the
Ford
were
overwhelmed
they
disappeared
buried
suddenly
under
angry
foam
Those
that
were
behind
drew
back
dismay
With
his
last
failing
senses
Frodo
heard
cries
and
seemed
him
that
saw
beyond
the
Riders
that
hesitated
the
shore
shining
figure
white
light
and
behind
ran
small
shadowy
forms
waving
flames
that
flared
red
the
grey
mist
that
was
falling
over
the
world
The
black
horses
were
filled
with
madness
and
leaping
forward
terror
they
bore
their
riders
into
the
rushing
flood
Their
piercing
cries
were
drowned
the
roaring

Then
Frodo

The
Prancing
Pony
and
his
madness
putting
the
Ring
the
dell
under
Weathertop
While
was
thinking
all
these
things
and
trying
vain
bring
his
memory
down
his
arriving
Rivendell
there
was
long
silence
broken
only
the
soft
puffs
Gandalf
pipe
blew
white
smoke
rings
out
the
window
Where
Sam
Frodo
asked
length
And
are
the
others
all
right

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Yes
they
are
all
safe
and
sound
answered
Gandalf
Sam
was
here
until
sent
him
off
get
some
rest
about
half
hour
ago
What
happened
the
Ford
said
Frodo
all
seemed
dim
somehow
and
still
does
Yes
would
You
were
beginning
fade
answered
Gandalf
The
wound
was
overcoming
you
last
few
more
hours
and
you
would
have
been
beyond
our
aid
But
you
have
some
strength
you
dear
hobbit
you
showed
the
Barrow
That
was
touch
and
perhaps
the
most
dangerous
moment
all
wish
you
could
have
held
out
Weathertop
You
seem
know
great
deal
already
said
Frodo
have
not
spoken
the
others
about
the
Barrow
first
was
too
horrible
and
afterwards
there
were
other
things
think
about
How
you
know
about
You
have
talked
long
your
sleep
Frodo
said
Gandalf
gently
and
has
not
been
hard
for
read
your
mind
and
memory
not
worry
Though
said
absurd
just
now
did
not
mean
think
well
you
and
the
others
small
feat
have
come
far
and
through
such
dangers
still
bearing
the
Ring
should
never
have
done
without
Strider
said
Frodo
But
needed
you
did
not
know
what
without
you
was
delayed
said
Gandalf
and
that
nearly
proved
our
ruin
And
yet
not
sure
may
have
been
better
wish
you
would
tell
what
happened
All
good
time
You
are
not
supposed
talk
worry
about
anything
today
Elrond
orders
But
talking
would
stop
thinking
and
wondering
which
are
quite
tiring
said
Frodo
wide
awake
now
and
remember
many
things
that
want
explaining
Why
were
you
delayed
You
ought
tell
that
least
You
will
soon
hear
all
you
wish
know
said
Gandalf
shall
have
Council
soon
you
are
well
enough
the
moment
will
only
say
that
was
held
captive
You

Frodo

287
Yes
Gandalf
the
Grey
said
the
wizard
solemnly
There
are
many
powers
the
world
for
good
for
evil
Some
are
greater
than
Against
some
have
not
yet
been
measured
But
time
coming
The
Morgul
lord
and
his
Black
Riders
have
come
forth
War
preparing
Then
you
knew
the
Riders
already
before
met
them
Yes
knew
them
Indeed
spoke
them
once
you
for
the
Black
Riders
are
the
Ringwraiths
the
Nine
Servants
the
Lord
the
Rings
But
did
not
know
that
they
had
arisen
again
should
have
fled
with
you
once
heard
news
them
only
after
left
you
June
but
that
story
must
wait
For
the
moment
have
been
saved
from
disaster
Aragorn
Yes
said
Frodo
was
Strider
that
saved
Yet
was
afraid
him
first
Sam
never
quite
trusted
him
think
not
any
rate
until
met
Glorfindel
Gandalf
smiled
have
heard
all
about
Sam
said
has
more
doubts
now
glad
said
Frodo
For
have
become
very
fond
Strider
Well
fond
not
the
right
word
mean
dear
though
strange
and
grim
times
fact
reminds
often
you
didn
know
that
any
the
Big
People
were
like
that
thought
well
that
they
were
just
big
and
rather
stupid
kind
and
stupid
like
Butterbur
stupid
and
wicked
like
Bill
Ferny
But
then
don
know
much
about
Men
the
Shire
except
perhaps
the
Bree
landers
You
don
know
much
even
about
them
you
think
old
Barliman
stupid
said
Gandalf
wise
enough
his
own
ground
thinks
less
than
talks
and
slower
yet
can
see
through

time
they
say
Bree
But
there
are
few
left

The

you

Frodo

thought
they

ago
thought

THE

Only
Ranger
cried
Gandalf
dear
Frodo
that
just
what
the
Rangers
are
the
last
remnant
the
North
the
great
people
the
Men
the
West
They
have
helped
before
and
shall
need
their

the

come
for
have
reached
Rivendell
but

said
Frodo
But
far

has
been

and
hope
shan
have
any
further
very
pleasant
just

have
had

and

You

more
than

for

said
Gandalf
How
the

and
shoulder
feel
now
don

Frodo
answered
They
don
feel
all
which
improvement
but
made
effort
can

Yes

You

Elrond
has
cured
you
has

you
for

ever
since
you

Days
said
Frodo
Well
four
nights
and
three
days
exact
The
Elves
brought
you
from
the
Ford
the
night
the

and
that
where
you
lost

have
been
terribly
anxious
and
Sam
has
hardly

except

Elrond

the

that
there
was

still
the

But

Then
Elrond

alarmed
said
Gandalf
gone
now
has
been
melted
And
seems
that
Hobbits
fade
very
reluctantly
have
known
strong
warriors
the
Big
People
who
would
quickly
have
been
overcome
that
splinter
which
you
bore
for
seventeen
days
What
would
they
have
done
asked
Frodo
What
were
the
Riders
trying
They
tried
pierce
your
heart
with
Morgul
knife
which
remains
the
wound
they
had
succeeded
you
would
have
become
like
they
are
only
weaker
and
under
their
com
mand
You
would
have
become
wraith
under
the
dominion
the
Dark
Lord
and
would
have
tormented
you
for
trying
keep
his
Ring
any
greater
torment
were
possible
than
being
robbed
and
seeing
his
hand
Thank
goodness
did
not
realize
the
horrible
danger
said
Frodo
faintly
was
mortally
afraid
course
but
had
known
more
should
not
have
dared
even
move
marvel
that
escaped
Yes
fortune
fate
have
helped
you
said
Gandalf
not
mention
courage
For
your
heart
was
not
touched
and
only
your
shoulder
was
pierced
and
that
was
because
you
resisted
the
last
But
was
terribly
narrow
shave
speak
You
were
gravest
peril
while
you
wore
the
Ring
for
then
you
were
half
the
wraith
world
yourself
and
they
might
have
seized
you
You
could
see
them
and
they
could
see
you
know
said
Frodo
They
were
terrible
behold
But
why
could
all
see
their
horses
Because
they
are
real
horses
just
the
black
robes
are
real
robes
that
they
wear
give
shape
their
nothingness
when
they
have
dealings
with
the
living
Then
why
these
black
horses
endure
such
riders
All
other
animals
are
terrified
when
they
draw
near
even
the
elf
horse
Glorhndel
The
dogs
howl
and
the
geese
scream
them
Because
these
horses
are
born
and
bred

Not

There

and

there

and
there

and
still
are
many
Men
warriors
and
kings
that
walk
alive
under

and
yet
are
under
his

And
their
number
growing
daily
What
about
Rivendell
and
the
Elves
Rivendell
safe
Yes
present
until
all
else
conquered
The
Elves
may
fear
the
Dark

and
they
may
fly
before
him
but
never
again
will
they
listen
him
serve
him
And
here
Riven

there
live
still
some
his

foes
the

the

live
once
both

and
against
both
the

they
have

thought
that
saw
white
figure
that
shone
and
did
not
grow
dim
like
the

Was
that
Glorfindel
then
Yes
you
saw
him
for
moment
upon
the
other
side
one
the

the
Firstborn
Elf
lord
house
princes
Indeed
there
power
Rivendell
withstand
the

Mordor
for
while
and
elsewhere
other

still
dwell
There
power
too
another
kind
the

But
all
such

The

putting
forth

his

Still
said
standing
suddenly
and
sticking
out
his
chin
while
his
beard
went
stiff
and
straight
like
bristling
wire
must
keep
our
courage
You
will
soon
well
not
talk
you
death
You
are
Rivendell
and
you
need
not
worry
about
anything
for
the
present
haven
any
courage
keep
said
Frodo
but
not
worried
the

Just
give
news
friends
and
tell
the
end
the
affair
the

keep
asking
and
shall
content
for
the

After
that
shall
have
another
sleep
think
but
shan
able
close
eyes
until
you
have
finished
the
story
for
Gandalf
moved
his
chair
the
bedside
and
took
good
look
Frodo
The
colour
had
come
back
his
face
and
his
eyes
were
clear
and
fully
awake
and
aware
was
smiling
MANY

and
there
seemed
little
wrong
with
him
But
the
wizard
eye
there
was
faint
change
just
hint
were
transparency
about
him
and
especially
about
the
left
hand
that
lay
outside
upon
the
coverlet
Still
that
must
expected
said
Gandalf
himself
not
half
through
yet
and
what
will
come
the
end
not
even
Elrond
can
foretell
Not
evil
think
may
become
like
glass
filled
with
clear
light
for
eyes
see
that
can
You
look
splendid
said
aloud
will
risk
brief
tale
without
consulting
Elrond
But
quite
brief
mind
you
and
then
you
must
sleep
again
This
what
happened
far
can
gather
The
Riders
made
straight
for
you
soon
you
fled
They
did
not
need
the
guidance
their
horses
any
longer
you
had
become
visible
them
being
already
the
threshold
their
world
And
also
the
Ring
drew
them
Your
friends
sprang
aside
off
the
road
they
would
have
been
ridden
down
They
knew
that
nothing
could
save
you
the
white
horse
could
not
The
Riders
were
too
swift
over
take
and
too
many
oppose
foot
even
Glorfindel
and
Aragorn
together
could
not
withstand
all
the
Nine
once
When
the
Ringwraiths
swept
your
friends
ran
behind
Close
the
Ford
there
small
hollow
beside
the
road
masked
few
stunted
trees
There
they
hastily
kindled
fire
for
Glorfindel
knew
that
flood
would
come
down
the
Riders
tried
cross
and
then
would
have
deal
with
any
that
were
left
his
side
the
river
The
moment
the
flood
appeared
rushed
out
followed
Aragorn
and
the
others
with
flaming
brands
Caught
between
fire
and
water
and
seeing
Elf
lord
revealed
his
wrath
they
were
dismayed
and
their
horses
were
stricken
with
mad
ness
Three
were
carried
away
the
first
assault
the
flood
the
others
were
now
hurled
into
the
water
their
horses
and
overwhelmed
And
that
the
end
the
Black
Riders
asked
Frodo
said
Gandalf
Their
horses
must
have
perished
and
without
them
they
are
crippled
But
the
Ringwraiths
292
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
themselves
cannot
easily
destroyed
However
there
nothing
more
fear
from
them
present
Your
friends
crossed
after
the
flood
had
passed
and
they
found
you
lying
your
face
the
top
the
bank
with
broken
sword
under
you
The
horse
was
standing
guard
beside
you
You
were
pale
and
cold
and
they
feared
that
you
were
dead
worse
Elrond
folk
met
them
carrying
you
slowly
towards
Rivendell
Who
made
the
flood
asked
Frodo
Elrond
commanded
answered
Gandalf
The
river
this
valley
under
his
power
and
will
rise
anger
when
has
great
need
bar
the
Ford
soon
the
captain
the
Ringwraiths
rode
into
the
water
the
flood
was
released
may
say
added
few
touches
own
you
may
not
have
noticed
but
some
the
waves
took
the
form
great
white
horses
with
shining
white
riders
and
there
were
many
rolling
and
grinding
boulders
For
moment
was
afraid
that
had
let
loose
too
fierce
wrath
and
the
flood
would
get
out
hand
and
wash
you
all
away
There
great
vigour
the
waters
that
come
down
from
the
snows
the
Misty
Mountains
Yes
all
comes
back
now
said
Frodo
the
tremen
dous
roaring
thought
was
drowning
with
friends
and
enemies
and
all
But
now
are
safe
Gandalf
looked
quickly
Frodo
but
had
shut
his
eyes
Yes
you
are
all
safe
for
the
present
Soon
there
will
feasting
and
merrymaking
celebrate
the
victory
the
Ford
Bruinen
and
you
will
all
there
places
honour
Splendid
said
Frodo
wonderful
that
Elrond
and
Glorfindel
and
such
great
lords
not
mention
Strider
should
take
much
trouble
and
show
much
kindness
Well
there
are
many
reasons
why
they
should
said
Gandalf
smiling
one
good
reason
The

another
you
are
the
Ring
bearer
And
you
are
the
heir
Bilbo
the

finder
Dear
Bilbo

Frodo
sleepily
wonder
where

and
could

made
him
laugh
The
cow
jumped
over
the
Moon
And
the
poor
old
troll
With
that
fell
fast
asleep
Frodo
was
now
safe
the
Last
Homely
House
east
the
Sea
That
house
was
Bilbo
had
long
ago
reported
perfect
house
whether
you
like
food
sleep
story
telling
singing
just
sitting
and
thinking
best
pleasant
mixture
them
all
Merely
there
was
cure
for
weari
ness
fear
and
sadness
the
evening
drew
Frodo
woke
again
and
found
that
longer
felt
need
rest
sleep
but
had
mind
for
food
and
drink
and
probably
for
singing
and
story
telling
afterwards
got
out
bed
and
discovered
that
his
arm
was
already
nearly
useful
again
ever
had
been
found
laid
ready
clean
garments
green
cloth
that
fitted
him
excellently
Looking
mirror
was
startled
see
much
thinner
reflection
himself
than
remembered
looked
remarkably
like
the
young
nephew
Bilbo
who
used
tramping
with
his
uncle
the
Shire
but
the
eyes
looked
out
him
thoughtfully
Yes
you
have
seen
thing
two
since
you
last
peeped
out
looking
glass
said
his
reflection
But
now
for
merry
meeting
stretched
out
his
arms
and
whistled
tune
that
moment
there
was
knock
the
door
and
Sam
came
ran
Frodo
and
took
his
left
hand
awkwardly
and
shyly
stroked
gently
and
then
blushed
and
turned
hastily
away
Hullo
Sam
said
Frodo
warm
said
Sam
Meaning
your
hand
Frodo
has
felt
cold
through
the
long
nights
But
glory
and
trum
pets
cried
turning
round
again
with
shining
eyes
and
dancing
the
floor
fine
see
you
and
yourself
again
sir
Gandalf
asked
come
and
see
you
were
ready
come
down
and
thought
was
joking
ready
said
Frodo
Let
and
look
for
the
rest
the
party
294
THE

THE

can

you
them
sir
said
Sam

this
and
very

Always

more
discover
and
knowing
what
you
find
round
corner
And
Elves
sir
Elves
here
and
Elves
there
Some
like
lungs
terrible
and
splendid
and
some
merry
children
And
the
music
and
the
singing
not
that
have
had
the
time
the
heart
for
much
listening
since
got
here
But
getting
know
some
the
ways
the

know
what
you
have
been

Sam
said
Frodo
taking
his
arm
But
you
shall
merry
tonight
and
listen
your

content
Come
guide
round
the

Sam
led
him
along
several
passages
and
down
many
steps
and
out
into
high
garden
above
the
steep
bank
the
river
found
his
friends
sitting
porch
the
side
the
house
looking
east
Shadows
had
fallen
the
valley
below
but
there
was
still

The
air
was
warm
The
sound
running

falling
water
was
loud
and
the

was
filled
with
faint
scent

and

Hurray
cried
Pippin
springing
Here
our

Make

for
Frodo
Lord

Hush
said
Gandalf
from
the
shadows
the
back
the
porch
Evil
things
not
come
into
this

but
all
the

should
not

them
The

not
Frodo
but
the

the
Dark
Tower
Mordor
whose

again
stretching
out

Outside
getting
dark
Gandalf
has
been
saying
many
cheerful
things
like
that

Pippin
thinks

But
seems
impossible
somehow
feel
gloomy
depressed
this

the

for
the
occasion
feel
like
singing
myself
laughed
Frodo
Though
the
moment
feel
more
like
eating
and
drinking
That
will
soon
cured
said
Pippin
You

shown
your
usual
cunning

More
than
meal
feast
said
Merry
soon
Gandalf
reported
that
you
were
recovered
the
preparations
began
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
they
were
summoned
the
hall
the
ringing
many
bells
The
hall
Elrond
house
was
filled
with
folk
Elves
for
the
most
part
though
there
were
few
guests
other
sorts
Elrond
was
his
custom
sat
great
chair
the
end
the
long
table
upon
the
dais
and
next
him
the
one
side
sat
Glorfindel
the
other
side
sat
Gandalf
Frodo
looked
them
wonder
for
had
never
before
seen
Elrond
whom
many
tales
spoke
and
they
sat
upon
his
right
hand
and
his
left
Glorfindel
and
even
Gandalf
whom
thought
knew
well
were
revealed
lords
dignity
and
power
Gandalf
was
shorter
stature
than
the
other
two
but
his
long
white
hair
his
sweeping
silver
beard
and
his
broad
shoulders
made
him
look
like
some
wise
king
ancient
legend
his
aged
face
under
great
snowy
brows
his
dark
eyes
were
set
like
coals
that
could
leap
suddenly
into
fire
Glorfindel
was
tall
and
straight
his
hair
was
shining
gold
his
face
fair
and
young
and
fearless
and
full
joy
his
eyes
were
bright
and
keen
and
his
voice
like
music
his
brow
sat
wisdom
and
his
hand
was
strength
The
face
Elrond
was
ageless
neither
old
nor
young
though
was
written
the
memory
many
things
both
glad
and
sorrowful
His
hair
was
dark
the
shadows
twilight
and
upon
was
set
circlet
silver
his
eyes
were
grey
clear
evening
and
them
was
light
like
the
light
stars
Venerable
seemed
king
crowned
with
many
winters
and
yet

Young
she

The
braids
her
dark
hair
were
touched

her
white
arms
and
clear
face
were
flawless
and
smooth
and
the
light

was
her

grey

yet
queenly
she
looked
and
thought
and
knowledge
were
her

one
who
has
known
many
things
that
the
years
bring
Above
her
brow
her
head
was
covered
with
cap
silver
lace
netted
with
small
gems
glittering
white
but
her
soft
grey
raiment
had

save

silver
was
that
Frodo
saw
her
whom
few
mortals
had
yet
seen
Arwen
daughter
Elrond
whom
was
said
that
the
likeness
Luthien
had
come
earth
again
and
she
was
called
Undomiel
for
she
was
the
Evenstar
her
people
Long
she
had
been
the
land
her
mother
kin
Lorien
beyond
the
mountains
and
was
but
lately
returned
Riven
dell
her
father
house
But
her
brothers
Elladan
and
Elrohir
were
out
upon
errantry
for
they
rode
often
far
afield
with
the
Rangers
the
North
forgetting
never
their
mother
torment
the
dens
the
ores
Such
loveliness
living
thing
Frodo
had
never
seen
before
nor
imagined
his
mind
and
was
both
surprised
and
abashed
find
that
had
seat
Elrond
table
among
all
these
folk
high
and
fair
Though
had
suitable
chair
and
was
raised
upon
several
cushions
felt
very
small
and
rather
out
place
but
that
feeling
quickly
passed
The
feast
was
merry
and
the
food
all
that
his
hunger
could
desire
was
some
time
before
looked
about
him
again
even
turned
his
neighbours
looked
first
for
his
friends
Sam
had
begged
allowed
wait
his
master
but
had
been
told
that
for
this

Frodo

Frodo

him
Welcome

said
the
dwarf
turning
towards
him
Then
actually
rose
from
his
seat
and
bowed
Gloin

said
and
bowed
still
lower
Frodo
Baggins
your

and
your

said
Frodo
correctly
rising

and
scattering
his

right
guessing
that
you
are
the
Gloin
one
the

companions
the

Quite
right
answered
the

gathering
the

and
courteously
assisting
Frodo
back
into

Nothing

Frodo

that
even

the

the

was
not
one
for
casual
talk
and
any
case
wished
forget
his
troubles
for
time
But
equally
curious
added

what
brings

from
the
Lonely

Gloin
looked
him
you
have
not

think
will
not
speak
yet
that
either
Master
Elrond
will
summon
all
ere
long
believe
and
then
shall
all
hear
many
things
But
there
much
else
that
may
told
Throughout
the
rest
the
meal
they
talked
together
but
Frodo
listened
more
than
spoke
for
the
news
the
Shire
apart
from
the
Ring
seemed
small
and
far
away
and
unim
portant
while
Gloin
had
much
tell

Frodo
learned
that

They

But
their

added
with

and
like

old
they
are
not

Still
they

these

Frodo

and
made
attempt

the

though
actually
soon
got
rather
lost
among
the
strange
names
people
and
places
that
had
never

before
was
interested
however
hear
that
Dain
was

answered
largely
account
Balin
that
have
come
ask
the
advice
those
that
dwell

But
tonight
let
speak
merrier
things
Gloin
began
then
talk
the
works
his
people
telling
Frodo
about
their
great
labours
Dale
and
under
the
Moun
tain
have
done
well
said
But
metal
work
cannot
rival
our
fathers
many
whose
secrets
are
lost
make
good
armour
and
keen
swords
but
cannot
again
make
mail
blade
match
those
that
were
made
before
the
dragon
came
Only
mining
and
building
have
surpassed
the
old
days
You
should
see
the
waterways
Dale
Frodo
and
the
fountains
and
the
pools
You
should
see
the
stone
paved
roads
many
colours
And
the
halls
and
cavernous
streets
under
the
earth
with
arches
carved
like
trees
and
the
terraces
and
towers
upon
the
Mountain
sides
Then
you
would
see
that
have
not
been
idle
will
come
and
see
them
ever
can
said
Frodo
How
surprised
Bilbo
would
have
been
see
all
the
changes
the
Desolation
Smaug
Gloin
looked
Frodo
and
smiled
You
were
very
fond
Bilbo
were
you
not
asked
Yes
answered
Frodo
would
rather
see
him
than
all
the
towers
and
palaces
the
world
length
the
feast
came
end
Elrond
and
Arwen
rose
and
went
down
the
hall
and
the
company
followed
them
due
order
The
doors
were
thrown
open
and
they
went
across
wide
passage
and
through
other
doors
and
came
into
further
hall
were
tables
but
bright
fire
was
burning
great
hearth
between
the
carven
pillars
upon
either
side
Frodo
found
himself
walking
with
Gandalf
This
the

Fire
said
the
wizard
Here
you
will
hear
many
songs
and
tales
you
can
keep
awake
But
except
high
days
usually
stands
empty
and
quiet
and
people
come
here
who
wish
for
peace
and
thought
There
always
fire
here
all
the
year
round
but
there
little
other
light

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Elrond
entered
and
went
towards
the
seat
prepared
for
him
Elvish
minstrels
began
make
sweet
music
Slowly
the
hall
filled
and
Frodo
looked
with
delight
upon
the
many
fair
faces
that
were
gathered
together
the
golden
firelight
played
upon
them
and
shimmered
their
hair
Suddenly
noticed
not
far
from
the
further
end
the
fire
small
dark
figure
seated
stool
with
his
back
propped
against
pillar
Beside
him
the
ground
was
drinking
cup
and
some
bread
Frodo
wondered
whether
was
ill
people
were
ever
ill
Rivendell
and
had
been
unable
come
the
feast
His
head
seemed
sunk
sleep
his
breast
and
fold
his
dark
cloak
was
drawn
over
his
face
Elrond
went
forward
and
stood
beside
the
silent
figure
Awake
little
master
said
with
smile
Then
turning
Frodo
beckoned
him
Now
last
the
hour
has
come
that
you
have
wished
for
Frodo
said
Here
friend
that
you
have
long
missed
The
dark
figure
raised
its
head
and
uncovered
its
face
Bilbo
cried
Frodo
with
sudden
recognition
and
sprang
forward
Hullo
Frodo
lad
said
Bilbo
you
have
got
here
last
hoped
you
would
manage
Well
well
all
this
feasting
your
honour
hear
hope
you
enjoyed
yourself
Why
weren
you
there
cried
Frodo
And
why
haven
been
allowed
see
you
before
Because
you
were
asleep
have
seen
good
deal
you
have
sat
your
side
with
Sam
each
day
But
for
the
feast
don
for
such
things
much
now
And
had
something
else
What
were
you
doing
Why
sitting
and
thinking
lot
that
nowadays
and
this
the
best
place
rule
Wake
indeed
said
cocking
eye
Elrond
There
was
bright
twinkle
and
sign
sleepiness
that
Frodo
could
see
Wake
was
not
asleep
Master
Elrond
you
want
know
you
have

Messen

were
sent
find

though
none
knew
where
was
why
had
not

the

the
meanwhile
Frodo
and
Bilbo
sat
side
side
and
Sam
came
quickly
and
placed
himself
near
them
They
talked
together
soft
voices
oblivious
the
mirth
and
music
the
hall
about
them
Bilbo
had
not
much
say
himself
When
had
left
Hobbiton
had
wandered
off
aimlessly
along
the
Road
the
country

side
but
somehow
had

Then

And
course

They
sing
them
occasionally
just
please
think
for
course
they
aren
really
good
enough
for

And
listen
and
think
Time

place
altogether
hear

course
Gandalf

often
Not
that

has
become
closer
than

The

pity
that

THE

THE

Gandalf
and
Elrond
mean
They
seemed
think
that
the
Enemy
was
looking
high
and
low
for
and
would
make
mincemeat
caught
tottering
about
the
Wild
And
Gandalf
said
The

has
passed
Bilbo
would
good
you
others
you
tried
meddle
with
again
Odd
sort
remark
just
like
Gandalf
But
said
was
looking
after
you
let
things
fright
fully
glad
see
you
safe
and
sound
paused
and
looked
Frodo
doubtfully
Have
you
got
here
asked
whisper
can
help
feeling
curious
you
know
after
all
heard
should
very
much
like
just
peep
again
Yes

answered
Frodo
feeling
strange

tance
looks
just
the
same
ever
did
Well
should
just
like
see
for
moment
said
Bilbo
When
had
dressed
Frodo
found
that
while
slept
the
Ring
had
been
hung
about
his
neck
new
chain
light
but
strong
Slowly
drew
out
Bilbo
put
out
his
hand
But
Frodo
quickly
drew
back
the
Ring
his
distress
and
amaze
ment
found
that
was
longer
looking
Bilbo
shadow
seemed
have
fallen
between
them
and
through
found
himself
eyeing
little
wrinkled
creature
with
hungry
face
and
bony
groping
hands
felt
desire
strike
him
The
music
and
singing
round
them
seemed
falter
and
silence
fell
Bilbo
looked
quickly
Frodo
face
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
understand
now
said
Put
away
sorry
sorry
you
have
come
for
this
burden
sorry
about
everything
Don

have
end
suppose
not
Someone

has
carry

Well
can
helped
wonder
any
good
trying
finish
book
But
don
let
worry
about
now
let
have
some
real
News
Tell
all
about
the
Shire
Frodo
hid
the

away
and
the
shadow

Bilbo

and

happily
Every

Sam

Suddenly
Bilbo

Strider

Frodo
You

Well
Strider
one

said
Bilbo
What
you
call
him
that
for
They

Bree
said
Strider
laughing
and
that
how
was
introduced
him
And
why
you
call
him
Dunadan
asked
Frodo
The

Bilbo

Why

The

there
Strider
looked

Bilbo

said
But
often
must
put
mirth
aside
Elladan
and
Elrohir
have
returned
out
the

and
they
had
tidings
that
wished

Well

Bilbo

you

your

before

and

Let

Strider
smiled
Come
then
said
Let
hear
Frodo
was
left
himself
for
while
for
Sam
had
fallen
asleep
was
alone
and
felt
rather
forlorn
although
all
about
him
the
folk
Rivendell
were
gathered
But
those
near
him
were
silent
intent
upon
the
music
the
voices
and
the

THE

instruments
and
they
gave
heed
anything
else
Frodo
began

first
the
beauty
the

and
the
interwoven
words

even
though
understood
them

soon
began

them
Almost
seemed
that
the
words
took
shape
and
visions
far
lands
and
bright
things
that
had
never
yet
imagined
opened
out
before
him
and
the
firelit
hall
became
like
golden
mist
above
seas
foam
that
sighed
upon
the
margins
the
world
Then
the
enchantment
became
more
and
more
dreamlike
until
felt
that
endless
river
swelling
gold
and
silver
was
flowing
over
him
too
multitu

for
its

comprehended
became
part
the

about
him
and
drenched
and

him
Swiftly
sank
under

into

There
wandered
long

that
turned
into

and
then
suddenly

You

Not

thrown
back
and
seemed
clad

and

They
spoke
together
and
then
sud
denly
seemed
Frodo
that
Arwen
turned
towards
him
and
the
light
her
eyes
fell
him
from
afar
and
pierced
his
heart
stood
still
enchanted
while
the

They

Come
led
Frodo
back
his
own
little
room
opened
the
gardens
and
looked
south
across
the
ravine
the
Bruinen
There
they
sat
for
some
while
looking
through
the
window
the
bright
stars
above
the
steep
climbing
woods
and
talking
softly
They
spoke
more
the
small
news
the

far
away
nor
the
dark
shadows
and
perils
that
encompassed
them
but
the

the

You

THE

ELROND
Next
day
Frodo
woke
early
feeling
refreshed
and
well
walked
along
the
terraces
above
the
loud
flowing
Bruinen
and
watched
the
pale
cool
sun
rise
above
the
far
mountains
and
shine
down
slanting
through
the
thin
silver
mist
the
dew
upon
the
yellow
leaves
was
glimmering
and
the
woven
nets
gossamer
twinkled
every
bush
Sam
walked
beside
him
saying
nothing
but
sniffing
the
air
and
looking
every
now
and
again
with
wonder
his
eyes
the
great
heights
the
East
The
snow
was
white
upon
their
peaks
seat
cut
the
stone
beside
turn
the
path
they
came
upon
Gandalf
and
Bilbo
deep
talk
Hullo
Good
morning
said
Bilbo
Feel
ready
for
the
great
council
feel
ready
for
anything
answered
Frodo
But
most
all
should
like
walking
today
and
explore
the
valley
should
like
get
into
those
pine
woods
there
pointed
away
far
the
side
Rivendell
the
north
You
may
have
chance
later
said
Gandalf
But
cannot
make
any
plans
yet
There
much
hear
and
decide
today
Suddenly
they
were
talking
single
clear
bell
rang
out
That
the
warning
bell
for
the
Council
Elrond
cried
Gandalf
Come
along
now
Both
you
and
Bilbo
are
wanted
Frodo
and
Bilbo
followed
the
wizard
quickly
along
the
winding
path
back
the
house
behind
them
uninvited
and
for
the
moment
forgotten
trotted
Sam
Gandalf
led
them
the
porch
where
Frodo
had
found
his
friends
the
evening
before
The
light
the
clear
autumn
morning
was
now
glowing

The

came
from

lay

his

flight
and
the

the

growing
the

outside
already
seemed
only
the
memories
troubled
dream
but
the
faces
that
were
turned
meet
them
they
entered
were
grave
Elrond
was
there
and
several
others
were
seated
silence
about
him
Frodo
saw
Glorfindel
and
Gloin
and
corner
alone
Strider
was
sitting
clad
his
old
travel
worn
clothes
again
Elrond
drew
Frodo
seat
his
side
and
presented
him
the
company
saying
Here

the
hobbit
Frodo

Drogo
Few
have
ever
come
hither
through

then
pointed
out
and
named
those
whom
Frodo
had
not
met
before
There
was

Gloin

his

Gimli
Beside
Glorfindel
there
were
several

Erestor

indeed

Upped
with

the

these
things
Frodo
had
already
heard
many
rumours
but
the
tale
Gloin
was
new
him
and
when
the
dwarf
spoke
listened
attentively
appeared
that
amid
the
splendour
their
works
hand
the
hearts
the
Dwarves
the
Lonely
Mountain
were
troubled
now
many
years

said
Gloin
that
shadow
disquiet
fell
upon
our
people
Whence
came

Words

secret
was
said
that

and
that

Some
spoke
Moria

fathers
that
are
called

and
they
declared
that
now

Gloin
sighed
Moria
Moria

Too

there
and

But
now

with
dread
for

for

and

however
Balin
listened
the

and
resolved
and
though
Dain
did
not
give
leave
will
ingly
took
with
him
Ori
and
Oin
and
many
our

and
they
went

That
was
nigh
thirty
years

For
while
had

and
seemed
good

reported
that
Moria
had
been

begun
there
Then
there
was
silence
and
word
has
ever
come
from
Moria
since
Then
about
year
ago
messenger
came
Dain
but
not
from

from
Mordor
horseman
the
night

The

Sauron

Rings

And
asked
urgently
concerning
hobbits
what

they
were
and
where
they
dwelt
For
Sauron

said
that

was
known

And
then
his
fell
voice
was
lowered
and
would
have
sweetened
could
small
token
only
your

Sauron
asks
this
said
that
you
should
find
this
thief
such
was
his
word
and
get
from
him
willing
little
ring
the
least
rings
that
once
stole
but
trifle
that
Sauron
fancies
and
earnest
your

Find

Refuse
and

not
seem
well
you
refuse
that
his
breath
came
like
the
hiss
snakes
and
all
who
stood
shuddered
but
Dain
said
say
neither
yea
nor
nay
must
consider
this
message
and
what
means
under
its
fair
cloak
Consider
well
but
not
too
long
said
The
time

Dain
For
the

said
and
rode
into
the

Heavy

You

Elrond
You

all
that
you

understand
the

There
naught
that
you
can
other

But
you
not

You

The

What

with

the

the

that
Sauron
fancies
That
the

deem
That
the
purpose
for
which
you
are
called
hither
Called
say
though
have
not
called
you
strangers
from
distant
lands
You
have
come
and
are
here
met
this
very
nick
time
chance
may
seem
Yet
not
Believe
rather
that
ordered
that
who
sit
here
and
none
others
must
now
find
counsel
for
the
peril
the
world
Now
therefore
things
shall
openly
spoken
that
have
been
hidden
from
all
but
few
until
this
day
And
first
that
all
may
understand
what
the
peril
the
Tale
the
Ring
shall
told
from
the
beginning
even
this
present
And
will
begin
that
tale
though
others
shall
end
Then
all
listened
while
Elrond
his
clear
voice
spoke
Sauron
and
the
Rings
Power
and
their
forging
the
Second
Age
the
world
long
ago
part
his
tale
was
known
some
there
but
the
full
tale
none
and
many
eyes
were
turned
Elrond
fear
and
wonder
told
the
Elven
smiths
Eregion
and
their
friendship
with
Moria
and
their
eagerness
for
knowledge
which
Sauron
ensnared
them
For
that
time
was
not
yet
evil
behold
and
they
received
his
aid
and
grew
mighty
craft
whereas
learned
all
their
secrets
and
betrayed
them
and
forged
secretly
the
Mountain
Fire
the
One
Ring
their
master
But
Celebrimbor
was
aware
him
and
hid
the
Three
which
had
made
and
there
was
war
and
the
land
was
laid
waste
and
the
gate
Moria
was
shut
Then
through
all
the
years
that
followed
traced
the
Ring
but
since
that
history
elsewhere
recounted
even

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Elrond
himself
set
down
his
books
lore
not
here
recalled
For
long
tale
full
deeds
great
and
terrible
and
briefly
though
Elrond
spoke
the
sun
rode
the
sky
and
the
morning
was
passing
ere
ceased
Numenor
spoke
its
glory
and
its
fall
and
the
return
the
Kings
Men
Middle
earth
out
the
deeps
the
Sea
borne
upon
the
wings
storm
Then
Elendil
the
Tall
and
his
mighty
sons
Isildur
and
Anarion
became
great
lords
and
the
North
realm
they
made
Arnor
and
the
South
realm
Gondor
above
the
mouths
Anduin
But
Sauron
Mordor
assailed
them
and
they
made
the
Last
Alliance
Elves
and
Men
and
the
hosts
Gil
galad
and
Elendil
were
mustered
Arnor
Thereupon
Elrond
paused
while
and
sighed
remember
well
the
splendour
their
banners
said
recalled
the
glory
the
Elder
Days
and
the
hosts
Beleriand
many
great
princes
and
captains
were
assembled
And
yet
not
many
nor
fair
when
Thangorodrim
was
broken
and
the
Elves
deemed
that
evil
was
ended
for
ever
and
was
not
You
remember
said
Frodo
speaking
his
thought
aloud
his
astonishment
But
thought
stammered
Elrond
turned
towards
him
thought
that
the
fall
Gil
galad
was
long
age
ago
was
indeed
answered
Elrond
gravely
But
memory
reaches
back
even
the
Elder
Days
Earendil
was
sire
who
was
born
Gondolin
before
its
fall
and
mother
was
Elwing
daughter
Dior

many
defeats
and
many
fruitless

Gil

and
marched
with
his

was
the
Battle
Dagorlad
before
the
Black

Mordor
where
had
the
mastery
for
the
Spear
Gil
galad
and
the
Sword
Elendil
Aeglos
and
Narsil
none
could
withstand
beheld
the
last
combat
the
slopes
Orodruin
where
Gil
galad
died
and
Elendil
fell
and
Narsil
broke
beneath
him
but
Sauron
himself
was
overthrown
and
Isildur
THE

cut
the
Ring
from
his
hand
with
the

shard
his

sword
and
took
for
his
own
this
the
stranger
Boromir
broke
that
what
became

cried
ever
such
tale
was
told
the

has
long
been

have
heard
the
Great

him
that
not
name
but
believed
that
perished
from
the
world
the
ruin
his
first

Isildur
took
That
tidings
indeed
Alas
yes
said
Elrond
Isildur
took
should
not
have
been
should
have
been
cast
then
into
Orodruin
fire
nigh
hand
where
was
made
But
few
marked
what
Isildur
did
alone
stood
his
father
that
last
mortal
contest
and
Gil
galad
only
Cirdan
stood
and
But
Isildur
would
not
listen
our
counsel
This
will
have
weregild
for
father
and
brother
said
and
therefore
whether
would
took
treasure
But
soon
was
betrayed
his
death
and
named
the
North
Isildur
Bane
Yet
death
maybe
was
better
than
what
else
might
have
befallen
him
Only
the
North
did
these
tidings
come
and
only
few
Small
wonder
that
you
have
not
heard
them
Boromir
From
the
ruin
the
Gladden
Fields
where
Isildur
perished
three
men
only
came
ever
back
over
the
mountains
after
long
wandering
One
these
was
Ohtar
the
esquire
Isildur
who
bore
the
shards
the
sword
Elendil
and
brought
them
Valandil
the
heir
Isildur
who
being
but
child
had
remained
here
Rivendell
But
Narsil
was
broken
and
its
light
extinguished
and
has
not
yet
been
forged
again
Fruitless
did
call
the
victory
the
Last
Alliance
Not
wholly
yet
did
not
achieve
its
end
Sauron
was
dimin
ished
but
not
destroyed
His
Ring
was
lost
but
not
unmade
The
Dark
Tower
was
broken
but
its
foundations
were
not
removed
for
they
were
made
with
the
power
the
Ring
and
while
remains
they
will
endure
Many
Elves
and
many
mighty
Men
and
many
their
friends
had
perished
the

the

the

war
Anarion
was
slain
and
Isildur
was
slain
and
Gil

and
Elendil
were
more
Never

there
any
such

Elves
and
Men
for
Men
multiply
and
the
Firstborn
decrease
and
the
two

are
estranged
And
ever
since
that
day
the

Numenor
has
decayed
and
the
span
their
years
has
lessened
the

after
the

and
the

the

the
Men
Westernesse
were
diminished
and
their

Annuminas
beside

fell
into
ruin
and
the

removed
and
dwelt
Fornost
the

and
that
now
too
desolate
Men
call
Deadmen
Dike
and
they
fear

there
For
the

Arnor
dwindled
and
their

devoured
them
and
their

passed
leaving
only
green

the

the

the

Gondor

and
for
while
its

grew
recalling
somewhat
the

Numenor
ere
fell
High
towers
that
people
built
and
strong
places
and
havens
many
ships
and
the
winged

Their

Osgiliath
Citadel
the

And

and
westward

the
White

Minas

There
the

the

grew
white

from
the

that
tree
which
Isildur
brought
over
the
deep
waters
and
the

that

before

Eressea
and
before

But
the

Then
the

slept
and

And

evil

THE

called
Minas

Then
Minas

was
named
anew
Minas

these

And
now

its
close
For
the

Isildur

But
now

verily
from

And
would
well
for
all
know
what
passes
there
For
few
deem
know
our
deeds
and
therefore
guess
little
their
peril
should
fail
last
Believe
not
that
the
land
Gondor
the
blood
Numenor
spent
nor
all
its
pride
and
dignity
forgotten
our
valour
the
wild
folk
the
East
are
still
restrained
and
the
terror
Morgul
kept
bay
and
thus
alone
are
peace
and
freedom
maintained
the

behind
bulwark
the
West
But
the

won

Yet
that

not

The

Smoke

The

When

Wherever

Only

took

upon

Loth

give

long
have

seeking
the

And
here
the

more
shall
made
clear
you
said
Aragorn
standing
cast
his
sword
upon
the
table
that
stood
before
Elrond
and
the
blade
was
two
pieces
Here
the
Sword
that
was
Broken
said
And
who
are
you
and
what
have
you
with

asked
Boromir
looking
wonder
the
lean
face
the

and
his

stained

Elrond
and
descended
through

from

son
Minas

the

the

said
Aragorn

Frodo
said
Gandalf
solemnly
The

Hold

then
Boromir
will
understand
the

his
riddle
There
was
hush
and
all
turned
their
eyes
Frodo
was
shaken
sudden
shame
and
fear
and
felt
great
reluctance
reveal
the
Ring
and
loathing
its
touch
wished

far
away
The

gleamed
and
flickered
held
before

his
trembling
hand

The
words
were
not

Anyway
this

Bilbo

they

with

while
the

actually
not

recounted

did
not

Elrond
raised

Let
him
now
speak
THE

Then
less
willingly
than
Bilbo
Frodo
told
all
his

ings
with
the

from
the
day
that
passed
into
his
keeping
Every
step
his
journey
from
Hobbiton
the
Ford
Bruinen
was
questioned
and
considered
and
everything
that
could
recall
concerning
the
Black
Riders
was
examined
last
sat
down
again
Not
bad
Bilbo
said
him
You
would
have
made
good
story
they
hadn
kept
interrupting
tried
make
few
notes
but
shall
have
over
all
again
together
some
time
write
There
are
whole
chapters
stuff
before
you
ever
got
here
Yes
made
quite
long
tale
answered
Frodo
But
the
story
still
does
not
seem
complete
still
want
know
good
deal
especially
about
Gandalf
Galdor
the
Havens
who
sat
nearby
overheard
him
You
speak
for
also
cried
and
turning
Elrond
said
The
Wise
may
have
good
reason
believe
that
the
halfling
trove
indeed
the
Great
Ring
long
debate
unlikely
though
that
may
seem
those
who
know
less
But
may
not
hear
the
proofs
And
would
ask
this
also
What
Saruman
learned
the
lore
the
Rings
yet
not
among
What
his
counsel
knows
the
things
that
have
heard
The
questions
that
you
ask
Galdor
are
bound
together
said
Elrond
had
not
overlooked
them
and
they
shall
answered
But
these
things
the
part
Gandalf
make
clear
and
call
upon
him
last
for
the
place
honour
and
all
this
matter
has
been
the
chief
Some
Galdor
said
Gandalf
would
think
the
tidings
Gloin
and
the
pursuit
Frodo
proof
enough
that
the
halfling
trove
thing
great
worth
the
Enemy
Yet
ring
What
then
The
Nine
the
Nazgul
keep
The
Seven
are
taken

this
Gloin
stirred
but
did
not
speak
The

know
What
then
this
one
that
desires
much
There
indeed

waste

between

326
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
and
the
Mountain
between
the
loss
and
the
finding
But
the
gap
the
knowledge
the
Wise
has
been
filled
last
Yet
too
slowly
For
the
Enemy
has
been
close
behind
closer
even
than
feared
And
well
that
not
until
this
year
this
very
summer
seems
did
learn
the
full
truth
Some
here
will
remember
that
many
years
ago
myself
dared
pass
the
doors
the
Necromancer
Dol
Guldur
and
secretly
explored
his
ways
and
found
thus
that
our
fears
were
true
was
none
other
than
Sauron
our
Enemy
old
length
taking
shape
and
power
again
Some
too
will
remember
also
that
Saruman
dissuaded
from
open
deeds
against
him
and
for
long
watched
him
only
Yet
last
his
shadow
grew
Saruman
yielded
and
the
Council
put
forth
its
strength
and
drove
the
evil
out
Mirkwood
and
that
was
the
very
year
the
finding
this
Ring
strange
chance
chance
was
But
were
too
late
Elrond
foresaw
Sauron
also
had
watched
and
had
long
prepared
against
our
stroke
gov
erning
Mordor
from
afar
through
Minas
Morgul
where
his
Nine
servants
dwelt
until
all
was
ready
Then
gave
way
before
but
only
feigned
flee
and
soon
after
came
the
Dark
Tower
and
openly
declared
himself
Then
for
the
last
time
the
Council
met
for
now
learned
that
was
seeking
ever
more
eagerly
for
the
One
feared
then
that
had
some
news
that
knew
nothing
But
Saruman
said
nay
and
repeated
what
had
said
before
that
the
One
would
never
again
found
Middle
earth
the
worst
said
our
Enemy
knows
that
have
not
and
that
still
lost
But
what
was
lost
may
yet
found
thinks
Fear
not
Elis
hope
will
cheat
him
Have
not
earnestly
studied
this
matter
Into
Anduin
the
Great
fell
and
long
ago
while
Sauron
slept
was
rolled
down
the
River
the
Sea
There
let
lie
until
the
End
Gandalf
fell
silent
gazing
eastward
from
the
porch
the
far
peaks
the
Misty
Mountains
whose
great
roots
the
peril
the
world
had
long
lain
hidden
sighed
THE
COUNCIL
ELROND
327
There
was
fault
said
was
lulled
the
words
Saruman
the
Wise
but
should
have
sought
for
the
truth
sooner
and
our
peril
would
now
less
were
all
fault
said
Elrond
and
but
for
your
vigil
ance
the
Darkness
maybe
would
already
upon
But
say
From
the
first
heart
misgave
against
all
reason
that
knew
said
Gandalf
and
desired
know
how
this
thing
came
Gollum
and
how
long
had
possessed
set
watch
for
him
guessing
that
would
ere
long
come
forth
from
his
darkness
seek
for
his
treasure
came
but
escaped
and
was
not
found
And
then
alas
let
the
matter
rest
watching
and
waiting
only
have
too
often
done
Time
passed
with
many
cares
until
doubts
were
awak
ened
again
sudden
fear
Whence
came
the
hobbit
ring
What
fear
was
true
should
done
with
Those
things
must
decide
But
spoke
yet
dread
none
knowing
the
peril
untimely
whisper
went
astray
all
the
long
wars
with
the
Dark
Tower
treason
has
ever
been
our
greatest
foe
That
was
seventeen
years
ago
Soon
became
aware
that
spies
many
sorts
even
beasts
and
birds
were
gathered
round
the
Shire
and
fear
grew
called
for
the
help
the
Dunedain
and
their
watch
was
doubled
and
opened
heart
Aragorn
the
heir
Isildur
And
said
Aragorn
counselled
that
should
hunt
for
Gollum
too
late
though
may
seem
And
since
seemed
fit
that
Isildur
heir
should
labour
repair
Isildur
fault
went
with
Gandalf
the
long
and
hopeless
search
Then
Gandalf
told
how
they
had
explored
the
whole
length
Wilderland
down
even
the
Mountains
Shadow
and
the
fences
Mordor
There
had
rumour
him
and
guess
that
dwelt
there
long
the
dark
hills
but
never
found
him
and
last
despaired
And
then
despair
thought
again
test
that
might
make
the
finding
Gollum
unneeded
The
ring
itself
might
tell
were
the
One
The
memory

the
Council
came
back

The

the

and
the

each
their
proper
gem
Not
the
One

round
and
unadorned
were
one
the

but
its

set
marks
upon

the

could
still

read
What
those

Who

The

And
Saruman
But
great
though

What

Sauron

The

With
that
thought
forsook

passed

but
Saruman
most

Often
had

for

Less
welcome
did
the
Lord
Denethor
show
then

and
grudgingly
permitted

the

For
what

But
unless
you

you
will

that

said
Gandalf
THE
COUNCIL
ELROND
329
and
that
not
remembered
Gondor
would
seem
For
this
scroll
concerns
the
Ring
and
thus
wrote
Isildur
therein
The
Great
Ring
shall

shall
left
Gondor
where
also
dwell
the

ofElendil
lest
time
come
when
the
memory
these
great
matters
shall
grow
dim
And
after
these
words
Isildur
described
the
Ring
such
found
was
hot
when
first
took
hot
glede
and

was
scorched
that
doubt
ever
again
shall
free

pain
Yet
even

cooled
and
seemeth
shrink
though

But
for

When
read
these
words

was
ended
For
the

was
indeed
Isildur
guessed
the
tongue
Mordor
and
the
servants
the
Tower
And
what
was

therein
was

For
the
day

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
once
took
leave
Denethor
but
even
went
northwards
messages
came
out
Lorien
that
Aragorn
had
passed
that
way
and
that
had
found
the
creature
called
Gollum
Therefore
went
first
meet
him
and
hear
his
tale
Into
what
deadly
perils
had
gone
alone
dared
not
guess
There
little
need
tell
them
said
Aragorn
man
must
needs
walk
sight
the
Black
Gate
tread
the
deadly
flowers
Morgul
Vale
then
perils
will
have
too
despaired
last
and
began
homeward
journey
And
then
fortune
came
suddenly
what
sought
the
marks
soft
feet
beside
muddy
pool
But
now
the
trail
was
fresh
and
swift
and
led
not
Mordor
but
away
Along
the
skirts
the
Dead
Marshes
followed
and
then
had
him
Lurking
stagnant
mere
peering
the
water
the
dark
eve
fell
caught
him
Gollum
was
covered
with
green
slime
will
never
love
fear
for
bit
and
was
not
gentle
Nothing
more
did
ever
get
from
his
mouth
than
the
marks
his
teeth
deemed
the
worst
part
all
journey
the
road
back
watching
him
day
and
night
making
him
walk
before
with
halter
his
neck
gagged
until
was
tamed
lack
drink
and
food
driving
him
ever
towards
Mirkwood
brought
him
there
last
and
gave
him
the
Elves
for
had
agreed
that
this
should
done
and
was
glad
rid
his
company
for
stank
For
part
hope
never
look
upon
him
again
but
Gandalf
came
and
endured
long
speech
with
him
Yes
long
and
weary
said
Gandalf
but
not
without
profit
For
one
thing
the
tale
told
his
loss
agreed
with
that
which
Bilbo
has
now
told
openly
for
the
first
time
but
that
mattered
little
since
had
already
guessed
But
learned
then
first
that
Gollum
ring
came
out
the
Great
River
nigh
the
Gladden
Fields
And
learned
also
that
had
possessed
long
Many
fives
his
small
kind
The
power
the

Upon

The

the

was
astounding
Sud

menacing
powerful
harsh
stone
shadow
seemed
pass
over
the

and
the

for
moment

All
trembled
and
the

stopped
their

Never

tongue
Imladris
Gandalf
the

said
Elrond
the

passed

the

breathed
once
more
And
let
hope
that

again
answered
Gandalf
Nonetheless
not
ask
your
pardon
Master
Elrond
For
that
tongue
not

heard

then
let
all
put
doubt
aside
that
this
thing
indeed
what
the
Wise
have
declared
the
treasure
the
Enemy
fraught
with
all
his
malice
and
lies
great
part
his
strength
old
Out
the
Black
Years
come
the
words
that
the

heard
and
knew
that
they
had

betrayed
One
Ring

One

One

Know
also
friends
that
learned
more
yet
from
Gollum
was
loth
speak
and
his
tale
was
unclear
but
beyond
all
doubt
that
went
Mordor
and
there
all
that
knew
was
forced
from
him
Thus
the
Enemy
knows
now
that
the
One
found
that
was
long
the

and
since
his

have
pursued
almost
our

THE

THE

All
sat
silent
for
while
until
length
Boromir
spoke
small
thing
you
say
this
Gollum
Small
but
great
mischief
What
became
him
what
doom
did
you
put
him
prison
but
worse
said
Aragorn
had
suffered
much
There
doubt
that
was
tormented
and
the
fear
Sauron
lies
black
his
heart
Still
for
one
glad
that
safely
kept
the
watchful
Elves
Mirkwood
His
malice
great
and
gives
him
strength
hardly
believed
one
lean
and
withered
could
work
much
mischief
still
were
free
And
not
doubt
that
was
allowed
leave
Mordor
some
evil
errand
Alas
alas
cried
Legolas
and
his
fair
Elvish
face
there
was
great
distress
The
tidings
that
was
sent
bring
must
now
told
They
are
not
good
but
only
here
have
learned
how
evil
they
may
seem
this
company
Smeagol
who
now
called
Gollum

escaped
Escaped
cried
Aragorn
That
ill
news
indeed
shall
all
rue
bitterly
fear
How
came
the
folk
Thranduil
fail
their
trust
Not
through
lack
watchfulness
said
Legolas
but
per
haps
through
over
kindliness
And
fear
that
the
prisoner
had
aid
from
others
and
that
more
known
our
doings
than
could
wish
guarded
this
creature
day
and
night
Gandalf
bidding
much
though
wearied
the
task
But
Gandalf
bade
hope
still
for
his
cure
and
had
not
the
heart
keep
him
ever
dungeons
under
the
earth
where
would
fall
back
into
his
old
black
thoughts
You
were
less
tender
said
Gloin
with
flash
his
eyes
old
memories
were
stirred
his
imprisonment
the
deep
places
the
Elven
king
halls
Now
come
said
Gandalf
Pray
not
interrupt
good
Gloin
That
was
regrettable
misunderstanding
long
set
right
all
the
grievances
that
stand
between

and
THE

Dwarves

Gloin
rose
and
bowed
and
Legolas
continued
the
days
fair
weather
led
Gollum
through
the
woods
and
there
was
high
tree
standing
alone
far
from
the
others
which
liked
climb
Often
let
him
mount
the
highest
branches
until
felt
the
free
wind
but
set
guard
the
tree
foot
One
day
refused
come
down
and
the
guards
had
mind
climb
after
him
had
learned
the
trick
clinging
boughs
with
his
feet
well
with
his
hands
they
sat
the
tree
far
into
the
night
was
that
very
night
summer
yet
moonless
and
star
less
that
Ores
came
unawares
drove
them
off
after
some
time
they
were
many
and
fierce
but
they
came
from
over
the
mountains
and
were
unused
the
woods
When
the
battle
was
over
found
that
Gollum
was
gone
and
his
guards
were
slain
taken
then
seemed
plain
that
the
attack
had
been
made
for
his
rescue
and
that
knew
beforehand
How
that
was
contrived
cannot
guess
but
Gollum
cunning
and
the
spies
the
Enemy
are
many
The
dark
things
that
were
driven
out

the

Mirkwood
again

Gollum
came
his
trail
among
those
many
Ores
and
plunged
deep
into
the

going
south
But
ere
long
escaped
our

and
dared
not
continue
the

Well

what

But
may
play
part
yet
that
neither

Sauron
have
foreseen
And
now
will
answer
Galdor
other
questions
What
Saruman
What
are
his
counsels
this
need
This
tale
must
tell

for
only
Elrond

THE

the

June
was
the

but
cloud
anxiety
was

and
rode
the

the

for
had
foreboding
some
danger
still
hidden
from
but
drawing
near
There
messages
reached
tell
ing
war
and
defeat
Gondor
and
when
heard
the
Black
Shadow
chill
smote
heart
But
found
nothing
save
few
fugitives
from
the
South
yet
seemed
that
them
sat
fear
which
they
would
not
speak
turned
then
east
and
north
and
journeyed
along
the
Greenway
and
not
far
from
Bree
came
upon
traveller
sitting
bank
beside
the
road
with
his
grazing
horse
beside
him
was
Radagast
the
Brown
who
one
time
dwelt
Rhosgobel
near
the
borders
Mirkwood
one
order
but
had
not
seen
him
for
many
year
Gandalf
cried
was
seeking
you
But
stranger
these
parts
All
knew
was
that
you
might
found
wild
region
with
the
uncouth
name
Shire
Your
information
was
correct
said
But
not
put
that
way
you
meet
any
the
inhabitants
You
are
near
the

the

now
And
what
you
want
with
must
pressing
You
were
never
traveller
unless
driven
great

urgent

Then
looked
about
him
the

Nazgul
whispered
The

are
abroad
again
They
have
crossed
the
River
secretly
and
are
moving
westward
They
have
taken
the

knew
then
what
had
dreaded
without
knowing
The
Enemy
must
have
some
great
need
purpose
said
Radagast
but
what
that
makes
him
look
these
distant
and
desolate
parts
cannot
guess
What
you
mean
said
have
been
told
that
wherever
they
the
Riders
ask
for
news
land
called
Shire
The
Shire
said
but
heart
sank
For
even
the
Wise
might
fear
withstand
the
Nine
when
they
are
gathered
together
under
their
fell
chieftain
great
king
and

THE

and
now
wields
deadly

Who
told
you
and
who

asked
Saruman
the

answered
Radagast
And
told
say
that
you
feel
the
need
will
help
but
you
must
seek
his
aid
once
will
too
late
And
that

brought

For
Saruman

Radagast
course
worthy
Wizard
master

and
has
much

herbs

But
Saruman
has
long

the

and
thus
have
often
been
able
forestall
him
was
the

him
from

might
that
had
found
some

that
would
drive
back

Saruman
said
Then
you
must
now
said
Radagast
for
have
wasted
time
looking
for
you
and
the

running
short
was
told

Midsummer
and
that

here
Even
you

from

you

hardly
reach
him
before
the

And
with

Late

came

and
was
strongly
guarded
But
the

under

the

closed

But

Saruman
and
there
met

Yes

Have

For

Gandalf

But
not

Gandalf

Why

Until

and

They
took
and
they
set
alone
the

Orthanc
the

where
Saruman
was
accustomed
watch
the
stars
There
descent
save
narrow
stair
many
thousand
steps
and
the
valley
below
seems
far
away
looked
and
saw
that
whereas
had
once
been
green
and
fair
was
now
filled
with
pits
and
forges
Wolves
and
ores
were
housed
Isengard
for
Saruman
was
mustering
great
force
his
own
account
rivalry
Sauron
and
not
his

yet
Over
all
his
works
dark
smoke
hung
and
wrapped
itself
about
the
sides
Orthanc
stood
alone
island
the
clouds
and
had
chance
escape
and
days
were
bitter
was
pierced
with
cold
and
had
but
little
room
which
pace
and
fro
brooding
the
coming
the
Riders
the
North
That
the
Nine
had
indeed
arisen
felt
assured
apart
from
the
words
Saruman
which
might
lies
Long
ere
came
Isengard
had
heard
tidings
the
way
that
could
not
mistaken
Fear
was
ever
heart
for
friends
the

But
the

that

You

Gandalf

rode
away
towards

the

But
amidst
his

gathered
last
that
Frodo
had
left
Hobbiton
less
than
week
before
and
that
black
horseman
had
come
the

the
same
evening
Then

came

and
was
broken
open
and
empty

the

Then
for

left

might
have
been

but
rode
the

the

was
hard

for
went

But
seemed
that
one
two

ridden
towards
Bree
and
that

went
for

when

What

was
the

How

news
Bree
seemed
But
the
night
heard
more
Five
least
came
from
the
west
and
they
threw
down
the
gates
and
passed
through
Bree
like
howling
wind
and
the
Bree
folk
are
still
shivering
and
expecting
the
end
the
world
got
before
dawn
and
went
after
them
not
know
but
seems
clear
that
this
what
happened
Their
Captain
remained
secret
away
south
Bree
while
two
rode
ahead
through
the
village
and
four
more
invaded
the
Shire
But
when
these
were
foiled
Bree
and
Crickhollow
they
returned
their
Captain
with
tid
ings
and
left
the
Road
unguarded
for
while
except
their
spies
The
Captain
then
sent
some
eastward
straight
across
country
and
himself
with
the
rest
rode
along
the
Road
great
wrath
galloped
Weathertop
like
gale
and
reached
before
sundown
second
day
from
Bree
and
they
were
there
before
They
drew
away
from
for
they
felt
the
coming
anger
and
they
dared
not
face
while
the
Sun
was
the
sky
But
they
closed
round
night
and
was
besieged
the
hill
top
the
old

was
hard
put
indeed
such
light
and
flame

been

escaped
and

find
you

and
would
have
been

Aragorn
But
hoped

some
them
off
and
yet
reach
Rivendell

you
and
send

Four
Riders
did
indeed
follow
but
they
turned
back
after

But
was
that
came

only
two

its

had
already
been
brought
here
which
proved
well
indeed
And
that
Frodo
the

account
May
Elrond
and
the

forgive
the

But
such
thing
has
not
happened
before
that
Gandalf
broke

and
did
not
come
when

the

strange

Well
the

from

Here
all

here

But
have

any

What

There
was

Elrond
spoke

This

said
for
trusted

and
deep
all
our

perilous
study
too
deeply
the

the

for

for

But
such
falls
and
betrayals
alas
have
happened
before
the
tales
that
have
heard
this
day
the
tale
Frodo
was
most
strange
have
known
few
hobbits
save
Bilbo
here
and
seems
that
perhaps
not
alone
and
singular
had
thought
him
The
world
has
changed
much
since
last
was
the
westward
roads
The
Barrow
wights
know
many
names
and
the
Old
Forest
many
tales
have
been
told
all
that
now
remains
but
outlier
its
northern
march
Time
was
when
squirrel
could

tree
from
what
now
the
Shire
Dunland
west
Isengard
those

journeyed
once
and
many
things
wild
and

knew
But
had
forgotten
Bombadil
indeed
this
still
the
same
that
walked
the
woods
and
hills
long
ago
and
even
then
was
older
than
the
old
That
was
not
then
his
name
Iarwain
Ben

called
him
oldest
and
fatherless
But
many
another
name
has
since
been
given
other
folk
Forn
the

Orald
Northern

and

beside

maybe

THE

Could
not
still
send
messages
him
and
obtain
his

asked
Erestor
seems
that

power
even
over
the
Ring
should
not
put
said
Gandalf
Say
rather
that
the
Ring
has
power
over
him
his
own
master
But
cannot
alter
the
Ring
itself
nor
break
its
power
over
others
And
now
withdrawn
into
little
land
within
bounds
that
has
set
though
none
can
see
them
waiting
perhaps
for
change
days
and
will
not
step
beyond
them
But
within
those
bounds
nothing
seems
dismay
him

Erestor
Would
not
take
the
Ring
and
keep
there
for

harmless
said
Gandalf
not
willingly
might
all
the
free
folk
the
world
begged
him
but
would
not
under
stand
the
need
And
were
given
the
Ring
would
soon
forget
most
likely
throw
away
Such
things
have
hold
his

would
most

that
alone
answer
enough
But
any

said
Glorfindel

him

only
postpone
the

evil

away

unguessed

And
even

soon
late
the

would
learn
its

place
and
would
bend
all
his

Could
that

not

that

Glorfindel

But
Gandalf

Then
said
Glorfindel
let

For

that

there

speak
ever
hiding
and
destroying
Why
should
not
think
that
the
Great
Ring
has
come
into
our
hands
serve
the
very
hour
need
Wielding
the
Free
Lords
the
Free
may
surely
defeat
the
Enemy
That
what
most
fears
deem
The
Men
Gondor
are
valiant
and
they
will
never
sub
mit
but
they
may
beaten
down
Valour
needs
first
strength
and
then
weapon
Let
the
Ring
your
weapon
has
such
power
you
say
Take
and
forth
victory
Alas
said
Elrond
cannot
use
the
Ruling
Ring
That
now
know
too
well
belongs
Sauron
and
was
made
him
alone
and
altogether
evil
Its
strength
Boromir
too
great
for
anyone
wield
will
save
only
those
who
have
already
great
power
their
own
But
for
them
holds
even
deadlier
peril
The
very
desire
corrupts
the
heart
Consider
Saruman
any
the
Wise
THE
COUNCIL
ELROND

should
with
this
Ring
overthrow
the
Lord
Mordor
using
his
own
arts
would
then
set
himself
Sauron
throne
and
yet
another
Dark
Lord
would
appear
And
that
another
reason
why
the
Ring
should
destroyed
long
the
world
will
danger
even
the
Wise
For
nothing
evil
the
beginning
Even
Sauron
was
not
fear
take
the
Ring
hide
will
not
take
the
Ring
wield
Nor
said
Gandalf
Boromir
looked
them
doubtfully
but
bowed
his
head
said
Then
Gondor
must
trust
such
weapons
have
And
the
least
while
the
Wise
ones
guard
this
Ring
will
fight
Mayhap
the
Sword
that
was
Broken
may
still
stem
the
tide
the
hand
that
wields
has
inherited
not
heirloom
only
but
the
sinews
the
Kings
Men
Who
can
tell
said
Aragorn
But
will
put
the
test
one
day
May
the
day
not
too
long
delayed
said
Boromir
For
though
not
ask
for
aid
need
would
comfort
know
that
others
fought
also
with
all
the
means
that
they
have
Then
comforted
said
Elrond
For
there
are
other
powers
and
realms
that
you
know
not
and
they
are
hidden
from
you
Anduin

Still

all
these

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
alas
cried
Gloin
When
will
the
day
come
our
revenge
But
still
there
are
the
Three
What
the
Three
Rings
the
Elves
Very
mighty
Rings
said
not
the
Elf
lords
keep
them
Yet
they
too
were
made
the
Dark
Lord
long
ago
Are
they
idle
see
Elf
lords
here
Will
they
not
say
The
Elves
returned
answer
Did
you
not
hear
Gloin
said
Elrond
The
Three
were
not
made
Sauron
nor
did
ever
touch
them
But
them
not
permitted
speak
much
only
this
hour
doubt
may
now
say
They
are
not
idle
But
they
were
not
made
weapons
war
conquest
that
not
their
power
Those
who
made
them
did
not
desire
strength
domination
hoarded
wealth
but
understanding
making
and
healing
preserve
all
things
unstained
These
things
the
Elves
Middle
earth
have
some
measure
gained
though
with
sorrow
But
all
that
has
been
wrought
those
who
wield
the
Three
will
turn
their
undoing
and
their
minds
and
hearts
will
become
revealed
Sauron
regains
the
One
would
better
the
Three
had
never
been
That
his
purpose
But
what
then
would
happen
the
Ruling
Ring
were
destroyed
you
counsel
asked
Gloin
know
not
for
certain
answered
Elrond
sadly
Some
hope
that
the
Three
Rings
which
Sauron
has
never
touched
would
then
become
free
and
their
rulers
might
heal
the
hurts
the
world
that
has
wrought
But
maybe
when
the
One
has
gone
the
Three
will
fail
and
many
fair
things
will
fade
and
forgotten
That
belief
Yet
all
the
Elves
are
willing
endure
this
chance
said
Glorfindel
the
power
Sauron
may
broken
and
the
fear
his
dominion
taken
away
for
ever
Thus
return
once
more
the
destroying
the
Ring
said
Erestor
and
yet
come
nearer
What
strength
have
for
the
finding
the
Fire
which
was
made
That
the
path
despair
folly
would
say
the
long
wisdom
Elrond
did
not
forbid
Despair
folly
said
Gandalf
not
despair
for
THE
COUNCIL
ELROND
351
despair
only
for
those
who
see
the
end
beyond
all
doubt
not
wisdom
recognize
necessity
when
all
other
courses
have
been
weighed
though
folly
may
appear
those
who
cling
false
hope
Well
let
folly
our
cloak
veil
before
the
eyes
the
Enemy
For
very
wise
and
weighs
all
things
nicety
the
scales
his
malice
But
the
only
measure
that
knows
desire
desire
for
power
and
judges
all
hearts
Into
his
heart
the
thought
will
not
enter
that
any
will
refuse
that
having
the
Ring
may
seek
destroy
seek
this
shall
put
him
out
reckoning
least
for
while
said
Elrond
The
road
must
trod
but
will
very
hard
And
neither
strength
nor
wisdom
will
carry
far
upon
This
quest
may
attempted
the
weak
with
much
hope
the
strong
Yet
such
oft
the
course
deeds
that
move
the
wheels
the

them
because
they
must
while
the
eyes
the
great

Very
well
very
well
Master
Elrond
said
Bilbo
suddenly
Say
more
plain
enough
what
you
are
pointing
Bilbo
the
silly
hobbit
started
this
affair
and
Bilbo
had
better
finish
himself
was
very
comfortable
here
and
getting
with
book
you
want
know
just
writing

for
had
thought
putting
and
lived
happily
ever
afterwards
the
end
his
days
good
ending
and
none
the
worse
for
having
been
used
before
Now
shall
have
alter
that
does
not
look
like
coming
true
and
anyway
there
will
evidently
have
several
more
chapters
live
write
them
frightful
nuisance
When
ought
start
Boromir
looked
surprise
Bilbo
but
the
laughter
died
his
lips
when
saw
that
all
the
others
regarded
the
old
hobbit
with
grave
respect
Only
Gloin
smiled
but
his
smile
came
from
old
memories
course
dear
Bilbo
said
Gandalf
you
had
really
started
this
affair
you
might
expected
finish
But
you
352
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE

know
well
enough
now
that
starting
too
great
claim
for
any
and
that
only
small
part
played

any
hero
You
need
not
bow
Though
the
word
was
meant
and
not
doubt
that
under
jest
you
are
making
valiant
offer
But
one
beyond
your
strength
Bilbo
You
cannot
take
this
thing
back
has
passed
you
need
advice
any
longer
should
say
that
your
part
ended
unless
recorder
Finish
your
book
and
leave
the
ending
unaltered
There
still
hope
for
But
get
ready
write
sequel
when
they
come
back
Bilbo
laughed
have
never
known
you
give
pleasant
advice
before
said
all
your

this
advice
not

Still

But
tell
what
you

The

who

Exactly
And
who
are
they
That
seems
what
this

they

All
the
Council
sat
with
downcast

deep

great
dread
fell
him
was
awaiting
the
pronouncement
some
doom

THE
COUNCIL
ELROND
353
Elrond
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
him
and
Frodo
felt
his
heart
pierced
the
sudden
keenness
the
glance
understand
aright
all
that
have
heard
said
think
that
this
task
appointed
for
you
Frodo
and
that
you
not
find
way
one
will
This
the
hour
the
Shire
folk
when
they
arise
from
their
quiet
fields
shake
the
towers
and
counsels

Great
Who
all
the
Wise
could
have
foreseen
they

But
heavy
burden
heavy
that

But
you

that

though
all
the

Elf
friends
old
Hador
and
Hurin
and
Turin
and
Beren
himself
were
assembled
together
your

should

But
you
won

off
alone
surely
Master
cried
Sam
unable
contain
himself
any
longer
and
jumping
from
the
corner
where
had
been
quietly
sitting
the
floor
indeed
said
Elrond
turning
towards
him
with
smile
You
least
shall
with
him
hardly
possible
separate
you
from
him
even
when
summoned
secret
council
and
you
are
not
Sam
sat
down
blushing
and
muttering
nice
pickle

landed

Frodo
said
shaking
his
head
Chapter
THE
RING
GOES
SOUTH
Later
that
day
the
hobbits
held
meeting
their
own
Bilbo
room
Merry
and
Pippin
were
indignant
when
they
heard
that
Sam
had
crept
into
the
Council
and
had
been
chosen
Frodo
companion
most
unfair
said
Pippin
Instead
throwing
him
out
and
clapping
him
chains
Elrond
goes
and
rewards
him
for
his
cheek
Rewards
said
Frodo
can
imagine
more
severe
pun
ishment
You
are
not
thinking
what
you
are
saying
con
demned
this
hopeless
journey
reward
Yesterday
dreamed
that
task
was
done
and
could
rest
here
long
while
perhaps
for
good
don
wonder
said
Merry
and
wish
you
could
But
are
envying
Sam
not
you
you
have
then
will
punishment
for
any
left
behind
even
Rivendell
have
come
long
way
with
you
and
been
through
some
stiff
times
want
That
what
meant
said
Pippin
hobbits
ought
stick
together
and
will
shall
unless
they
chain
There
must
someone
with
intelligence
the
party
Then
you
certainly
will
not

Peregrin
Took
said
Gandalf
looking
through
the
window
which
was
near
the
ground
But
you
are
all
worrying
yourselves
unnecess
arily
Nothing
decided
yet
Nothing
decided
cried
Pippin
Then
what
were
you
all
doing
You
were
shut
for
hours
Talking
said
Bilbo
There
was
deal
talk
and
every
one
had
eye
opener
Even
old
Gandalf
think
Legolas
bit
news
about
Gollum
caught
even
him
the
hop
though
passed
off
THE
RING
GOES
SOUTH
355
You
were
wrong
said
Gandalf
You
were
inattentive
had
already
heard
from
Gwaihir
you
want
know
the
only
real
eye
openers
you
put
were
you
and
Frodo
and
was
the
only
one
that
was
not
surprised
Well
anyway
said
Bilbo
nothing
was
decided
beyond
choosing
poor
Frodo
and
Sam
was
afraid
all
the
time
that
might
come
that
was
let
off
But
you
ask
Elrond
will
send
out
fair
number
when
the
reports
come
Have
they
started
yet
Gandalf
Yes
said
the
wizard
Some
the
scouts
have
been
sent
out
already
More
will
tomorrow
Elrond
sending
Elves
and
they
will
get
touch
with
the
Rangers
and
maybe
with
Thranduil
folk
Mirkwood
And
Aragorn
has
gone
with
Elrond
sons
shall
have
scour
the
lands
all
round
for
many
long
leagues
before
any
move
made
cheer
Frodo
You
will
probably
make
quite
long
stay
here
said
Sam
gloomily
just
wait
long
enough
for
winter
come
That
can
helped
said
Bilbo
your
fault
partly
Frodo
lad
insisting
waiting
for
birthday
funny
way
honouring
can
help
thinking
Not
the
day
should
have
chosen
for
letting
the
into
Bag
End
But
there
you
can
wait
now
till
spring
and
you
can
till
the
reports
come
back
When
winter
first
begins
bite
and
stones
crack
the
frosty
night
when
pools
are
black
and
trees
are
bare
tis
evil
the
Wild
fare
But
that
afraid
will
just
your
luck
afraid
will
said
Gandalf
can
start
until
have
found
out
about
the
Riders
thought
they
were
all

said
Merry
You
cannot
destroy
Ringwraiths
like
that

Gandalf
The

for

the
meantime
you
should
try
and
forget
your
troubles
Frodo
not
know
can
anything
help
you
but
will
whisper
this
your
ears
Someone
said
that
intelligence
would
needed
the
party
was
right
think
shall
come
with
you
great
was
Frodo
delight
this
announcement
that
Gandalf
left
the
window
sill
where
had
been
sitting
and
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
only
said
think
shall
come
not
count
anything
yet
this
matter
Elrond
will
have
much
say
and
your
friend
the
Strider
Which
reminds

Elrond

How
long
you

said
Frodo
Bilbo
when
Gandalf
had
gone
don
know
can
count
days
Rivendell
said
Bilbo
But
quite
long
should
think
can
have
many
good
talk
What
about
helping
with
book
and
making
start
the
next
Have
you
thought
ending
Yes
several
and
all
are
dark
and
unpleasant
said
Frodo
that
won
said
Bilbo
Books
ought
have
good
endings
How
would
this
and
they
all
settled
down
and
lived
together
happily
ever
after
will
well
ever
comes
that
said
Frodo
said
Sam
And
where
will
they
five
That
what
often
wonder
For
while
the
hobbits
continued
talk
and
think
the
past
journey
and
the
perils
that
lay
ahead
but
such
was
the
virtue
the
land
Rivendell
that
soon
all
fear
and
anxiety
was
lifted
from
their
minds
The
future
good
ill
was
not
forgotten
but
ceased
have
any
power
over
the
present
Health
and
hope
grew
strong
them
and
they
were
content
with
each
good
day

taking
pleasure
every
meal
and
every
word
and
song
the
days
slipped
away
each
morning
dawned
bright
and
fair
and
each

silver
and
the
lingering
leaves
fell
from
the
naked
trees
wind
began
blow
chill
from
the
Misty
Mountains
the
east
The
Hunter
Moon
waxed
round
the
night
sky
and
put
flight
all
the
lesser
stars
But
low
the
South
one
star
shone
red
Every
night
the
Moon
waned
again
shone
brighter
and
brighter
Frodo
could
see
from
his
window
deep
the
heavens
burning
like
watchful
eye
that
glared
above
the
trees
the
brink
the
valley
The
hobbits
had
been
nearly
two
months
the
house
Elrond
and
November
had
gone
with
the
last
shreds
autumn
and
December
was
passing
when
the
scouts
began
return
Some
had
gone
north
beyond
the
springs
the
Hoarwell
into
the
Ettenmoors
and
others
had
gone
west
and
with
the
help
Aragorn
and
the
Rangers
had
searched
the
lands
far
down
the
Greyflood
far
Tharbad
where
the
old
North
Road
crossed
the
river
ruined
town
Many
had
gone
east
and
south
and
some
these
had
crossed
the
Mountains
and
entered
Mirkwood
while
others
had
climbed
the
pass
the
sources
the
Gladden
River
and
had
come
down
into
Wilderland
and
over
the
Gladden
Fields
and
length
had
reached
the
old
home
Radagast
Rhosgobel
Radagast
was
not
there
and
they
had
returned
over
the
high
pass
that
was
called
the
Redhorn
Gate
The
sons
Elrond
Elladan
and
Elrohir
were
the
last
return
they
had
made
great
journey
passing
down
the
Silverlode
into
strange
country
but
their
errand
they
would
not

any
save
Elrond
region
had
the
messengers
discovered
any
signs
tidings
the
Riders
other
servants
the
Enemy
Even
from
the
Eagles
the
Misty
Mountains
they
had
learned
fresh
news
Nothing
had
been
seen
heard
Gollum
but
the
wild
wolves
were
still
gathering
and

The

Then

Yes

your

And

because
you

said
Elrond
Neither
does
Frodo
said
Gandalf
unexpectedly
support
ing
Pippin
Nor
any
see
clearly
true
that
these

understood
the

they
would
not

But
they
would
still
wish
wish
that
they
dared
and
shamed
and
unhappy

Elrond
that
this

would

trust
rather
their

than
great
wisdom
Even
you

according

Then

said
Pippin
For

Let

You

said
Elrond
and
sighed
Now
the
tale
Nine
filled
seven
days
the
Company
must
depart
The
Sword
Elendil
was
forged
anew
Elvish
smiths
and
its
blade
was
traced
device
seven
stars
set
between
the
crescent
Moon
and
the
rayed
Sun
and
about
them
was
written
many
runes
for
Aragorn

Arathorn
was
going
war
upon
the
marches
Mordor
Very
bright
was
that
sword
when
was
made
whole
again
the
light
the
sun
shone
redly
and
the
light
the
moon
shone
cold
and
its
edge
was
hard
and
keen
And
Aragorn
gave
new
name
and
called
Anduril
Flame
the
West
Aragorn
and
Gandalf
walked
together
sat
speaking
their
road
and
the
perils
they
would
meet
and
they
pondered
the
storied
and
figured
maps
and
books
lore
that
were
the
house
Elrond
Sometimes
Frodo
was
with
them
but
was
content
lean
their
guidance
and
spent
much
time
could
with
Bilbo
those
last
days
the
hobbits
sat
together
the
evening
the
Hall
Fire
and
there
among
many
tales
they
heard
told
full
the
lay
Beren
and
Luthien
and
the
winning
the
Great
Jewel
but
the
day
while
Merry
and
Pippin
were
out
and
about
Frodo
and
Sam
were
found
with
Bilbo
his
own
small
room
Then
Bilbo
would
read
passages
from
his
book
which
still
seemed
very
incomplete
scraps
his
verses
would
take
notes
Frodo
adventures
the
morning
the
last
day
Frodo
was
alone
with
Bilbo
THE

361
and
the
old
hobbit
pulled
out
from
under
his
bed
wooden
box
lifted
the
lid
and
fumbled
inside
Here
your
sword
said
But
was
broken

safe
but
forgotten
ask
the
smiths

mend
time
now
thought
perhaps
you
would
care

this
don
you

took
from
the
box
small
sword
old
shabby
leathern
scabbard
Then
drew
and
its
polished
and
well
tended
blade
glittered
suddenly
cold
and
bright
This
Sting
said
and
thrust
with
little
effort
deep
into
wooden
beam
Take

Frodo
accepted
gratefully
Also
there
this
said
Bilbo
bringing

seemed
rather
heavy

its

With

Bilbo
moving

And
useful

from
Michel
Delving
before
started
and
packed
with

brought
all

But
did
not

this

except
look
sometimes
You
hardly
feel
any
weight
when
you
put

well
don
think

said
Frodo
Just
what
said
myself
said
Bilbo
But
never
mind
about
looks
You
can
wear
under
your
outer
clothes
Come
You
must
share
this

with
Don

Very

Bilbo
put

Just

Bilbo
But
there
more
about

Good

the

turning
round
and
slapping

cried
You

again

long

But
all
the

times
there
were
before

for

the

was
cold
grey
day
near
the

December
The
East
Wind
was
streaming
through
the
bare
branches
the
trees
and
seething
the
dark
pines
the
hills
Ragged
clouds
were
hurrying
overhead
dark
and
low
the
cheerless
shadows
the
early
evening
began
fall
the
Company
made
ready
set
out
They
were
start
dusk
for
Elrond
counselled
them
journey
under
cover
night
often
they
could
until
they
were
far
from
Rivendell
You
should
fear
the
many
eyes
the
servants
Sauron
said
not
doubt
that
news
the
discomfiture
the
Riders
has
already
reached
him
and
will
filled
with
wrath
Soon
now
his
spies
foot
and
wing
will
abroad
the
northern
lands
Even
the
sky
above
you
must
beware
you
your
way
The
Company
took
little
gear
war
for
their
hope
was
secrecy
not
battle
Aragorn
had
Anduril
but
other
weapon
and
went
forth
clad
only
rusty
green
and
brown
Ranger
the
wilderness
Boromir
had
long
sword
fashion
like
Anduril
but
less
lineage
and
bore
also
shield
and
his
war
horn
Loud
and
clear
sounds
the
valleys
the
hills
said
and
then
let
all
the
foes
Gondor
flee
Putting
his
lips
blew
blast
and
the
echoes
leapt
from

rock
and
all
that
heard

Slow

But
always
have
let

Gimli
the

wore

make
light
burdens
and
his
belt
was
broad
bladed
axe
Legolas
had
bow
and
quiver
and
his
belt
long
white
knife
The
younger
hobbits
wore
the
swords
that
they
had
taken
from
the
barrow
but
Frodo
took
only
Sting
and
his

Bilbo

Gandalf
bore
his

was

All

Elrond
with

Spare

none
other
than
the

brought
from
Bree
The

Rivendell
had
worked
great
wonder

him
was
glossy
and
seemed
have
the
vigour
youth
was
Sam
who
had
insisted
choosing
him
declaring
that
Bill
called
him
would
pine
did
not
come
That

and
would
talk
stayed
here
much
longer
gave
look
plain
Pippin
could
speak
you
don
let

you
Sam
follow
own
Bill
was
going
the
beast
burden
yet
was
the
only
member
the
Company
that
did
not
seem
depressed
Their
farewells
had
been
said
the
great
hall
the
fire
and
they
were
only
waiting
now
for
Gandalf
who
had
not
yet
come
out
the
house
gleam
firelight
came
from
the
open
doors
and
soft
lights
were
glowing
many
windows
Bilbo

stood
silent
the

beside
Frodo
Aragorn
sat
with
his

bowed
his

only
Elrond
knew
fully
what
this

him
THE

The
others
could
seen
grey
shapes
the
darkness
Sam
was
standing
the
pony
sucking
his
teeth
and
staring
moodily
into
the
gloom
where
the
river
roared
stonily
below
his
desire
for
adventure
was
its
lowest
ebb
Bill
lad
said
you

have
took
with
You
could
have
stayed
here
and
the
best
hay
till
the
new
grass
comes
Bill
swished
his
tail
and
said
nothing
Sam
eased
the
pack
his
shoulders
and
went
over
anxiously
his
mind
all
the
things
that
had
stowed
wondering
had
forgotten
anything
his
chief
treasure
his
cooking
gear
and
the
little
box
salt
that
always
carried
and
refilled
when
could
good
supply
pipe
weed
but
not
near
enough
warrant
flint
and
tinder
woollen
hose
linen
various
small
belongings
his
master
that
Frodo
had
forgotten
and
Sam
had
stowed
bring
them
out
triumph
when
they
were
called
for
went
through
them
all
Rope
muttered
rope
And
only
last
night
you
said
yourself
Sam
what
about
bit
rope
You
want
you
haven
got
Well
want
can
get
now
that
moment
Elrond
came
out
with
Gandalf
and
called
the
Company
him
This
last
word
said
low
voice
The
Ring
bearer
setting
out
the
Quest
Mount
Doom
him
alone
any
charge
laid
neither
cast
away
the
Ring
nor
deliver
any
servant
the
Enemy
nor
indeed
let
any
handle
save
members
the
Company
and
the
Council
and
only
then
gravest
need
The
others
with
him
free
companions
help
him
his
way
You
may
tarry
come
back
turn
aside
into
other
paths
chance
allows
The
further
you
the
less
easy
will
withdraw
yet
oath
bond
laid
you
further
than
you
will
For
you
not
yet
know
the
strength
your
hearts
and
you
cannot
foresee
what
each
may
meet
upon
the
road
Faithless
that
says
farewell
when
the
road
darkens
said
Gimli

THE

THE

Maybe
said
Elrond
but
let
him
not
vow
walk
the
dark
who
has
not
seen
the
nightfall
Yet
sworn
word
may
strengthen
quaking
heart
said
Gimli
break
said
Elrond
Look
not
too
far
ahead
But
now
with
good
hearts
Farewell
and
may
the
blessing
Elves
and
Men
and
all
Free
Folk
with
you
May
the
stars
shine
upon
your
faces
Good
good
luck
cried
Bilbo
stuttering
with
the
cold
don
suppose
you
will
able
keep
diary
Frodo
lad
but
shall
expect
full
account
when
you
get
back
And
don
too
long
Farewell
Many
others
Elrond
household
stood
the
shadows
and
watched
them
bidding
them
farewell
with
soft
voices
There
was
laughter
and
song
music
last
they
turned
away
and
faded
silently
into
the
dusk
They
crossed
the
bridge
and
wound
slowly
the
long
steep
paths
that
led
out
the
cloven
vale
Rivendell
and
they
came
length
the
high
moor
where
the
wind
hissed
through
the
heather
Then
with
one
glance
the
Last
Homely
House
twinkling
below
them
they
strode
away
far
into
the
night
the
Ford
Bruinen
they
left
the
Road
and
turning
southwards
went
narrow
paths
among
the
folded
lands
Their
purpose
was
hold
this
course
west
the
Mountains
for
many
miles
and
days
The
country
was
much
rougher
and
more
barren
than
the
green
vale
the
Great
River
Wilderland
the
other
side
the
range
and
their
going
would
slow
but
they
hoped
this
way
escape
the
notice
unfriendly
eyes
The
spies
Sauron
had
hitherto
seldom
been
seen
this
empty
country
and
the
paths
were
little
known
except
the
people
Rivendell
Gandalf
walked
front
and
with
him
went
Aragorn
who
knew
this
land
even
the
dark
The
others
were
file
behind
and
Legolas
whose
eyes
were
keen
was
the
rearguard
THE
RING

367
The
first
part
their
journey
was
hard
and
dreary
and
Frodo
remembered
little
save
the
wind
For
many
sunless
days
icy
blast
came
from
the
Mountains
the
east
and
garment
seemed
able
keep
out
its
searching
fingers
Though
the
Company
was
well
clad
they
seldom
felt
warm
either
moving
rest
They
slept
uneasily
during
the
middle
the
day
some
hollow
the
land
hidden
under
the
tangled
thorn
bushes
that
grew
thickets
many
places
the
late
afternoon
they
were
roused
the
watch
and
took
their
chief
meal
cold
and
cheerless
rule
for
they
could
seldom
risk
the
lighting
fire
the
evening
they
went
again
always
nearly
southward
they
could
find
way
first
seemed
the
hobbits
that
although
they
walked
and
stumbled
until
they
were
weary
they
were
creeping
for
ward
like
snails
and
getting
nowhere
Each
day
the
land
looked
much
the
same
had
the
day
before
Yet
steadily
the
mountains
were
drawing
nearer
South
Rivendell
they
rose
ever
higher
and
bent
westwards
and
about
the
feet
the
main
range
there
was
tumbled
ever
wider
land
bleak
hills
and
deep
valleys
filled
with
turbulent
waters
Paths
were
few
and
winding
and
led
them
often
only
the
edge
some
sheer
fall
down
into
treacherous
swamps
They
had
been
fortnight
the
way
when
the
weather
changed
The
wind
suddenly
fell
and
then
veered
round
the
south
The
swift
flowing
clouds
lifted
and
melted
away
and
the
sun
came
out
pale
and
bright
There
came
cold
clear
dawn
the
end
long
stumbling
night
march
The
travellers
reached
low
ridge
crowned
with
ancient
holly
trees
whose
grey
green
trunks
seemed
have
been
built
out
the
very
stone
the
hills
Their
dark
leaves
shone
and
their
berries
glowed
red
the
light
the
rising
sun
Away
the
south
Frodo
could
see
the
dim
shapes
lofty
mountains
that
seemed
now
stand
across
the
path
that
the
Company
was
taking
the
left
this

three

THE

THE
RING
After
while
left
the
Company
and
wandered
the
ridge
there
stood
the
shadow
tree
looking
out
southwards
and
westwards
with
his
head
posed
was
listening
Then
returned
the
brink
the
dell
and
looked
down
the
others
laughing
and
talking
What
the
matter
Strider
Merry
called
What
are
you
looking
for
you
miss
the
East
Wind
indeed
answered
But
miss
something
have
been
the
country
Hollin
many
seasons
folk
dwell
here
now
but
many
other
creatures
live
here
all
times
especially
birds
Yet
now
all
things
but
you
are
silent
can
feel
There
sound
for
miles
about
and
your
voices
seem
make
the
ground
echo
not
understand
Gandalf
looked
with
sudden
interest
But
what
you
guess
the
reason
asked
there
more
than
sur
prise
seeing
four
hobbits
not
mention
the
rest
where
people
are
seldom
seen
heard
hope
that
answered
Aragorn
But
have
sense
watchfulness
and
fear
that
have
never
had
here
before
Then
must
more
careful
said
Gandalf
you
bring
Ranger
with
you
well
pay
attention
him
especially
the
Ranger
Aragorn
must
stop
talking
aloud
rest
quietly
and
set
the
watch
was
Sam
turn
that
day
take
the
first
watch
but
Aragorn
joined
him
The
others
fell
asleep
Then
the
silence
grew
until
even
Sam
felt
The
breathing
the
sleepers
could
plainly
heard
The
swish
the
pony
tail
and
the
occasional
movements
his
feet
became
loud
noises
Sam
could
hear
his
own
joints
creaking
stirred
Dead
silence
was
around
him
and
over
all
hung
clear
blue
sky
the
Sun
rode
from
the
East
Away
the
South
dark
patch
appeared
and
grew
and
drove
north
like
flying
smoke
the
wind
What
that
Strider
don
look
like
cloud
said
Sam
whisper
Aragorn
made
answer
was
gazing
intently
the
sky
but
before
long
Sam
could
see
for
himself
THE

what
was
approaching
Flocks
birds
flying
great
speed
were
wheeling
and
circling
and
traversing
all
the
land
they
were
searching
for
something
and
they
were
steadily
drawing
nearer
Lie
flat
and
still
hissed
Aragorn
pulling
Sam
down
into
the
shade
holly
bush
for
whole
regiment
birds
had
broken
away
suddenly
from
the
main
host
and
came
flying
low
straight
towards
the
ridge
Sam
thought
they
were
kind
crow
large
size
they
passed
overhead
dense
throng
that
their
shadow
followed
them
darkly
over
the
ground
below
one
harsh
croak
was
heard
Not
until
they
had
dwindled
into
the
distance
north
and
west
and
the
sky
was
again
clear
would
Aragorn
rise
Then
sprang
and
went
and
wakened
Gandalf
Regiments
black
crows
are
flying
over
all
the
land
between
the
Mountains
and
the
Greyflood
said
and
they
have
passed
over
Hollin
They
are
not
natives
here
they
are
crebain
out
Fangorn
and
Dunland
not
know
what
they
are
about
possibly
there
some
trouble
away
south
from
which
they
are
fleeing
but
think
they
are
spying
out
the
land
have
also
glimpsed
many
hawks
flying
high
the
sky
think
ought
move
again
this
evening
Hollin
longer
wholesome
for
being
watched
And
that
case
the
Redhorn
Gate
said
Gandalf
and
how
can
get
over
that
without
being
seen
cannot
imagine
But
will
think
that
when
must
for
moving
soon
dark
afraid
that
you
are
right
Luckily
our
fire
made
little
smoke
and
had
burned
low
before
the
crebain
came
said
Aragorn
must
put
out
and
not
lit
again
Well
that
isn
plague
and
nuisance
said
Pippin
The

move

woke
the

All
because

THE

THE

There
may
many
unexpected
feasts
ahead
for
you
For
myself
should
like
pipe
smoke
comfort
and
warmer
feet
However
are
certain
one
thing
any
rate
will
get
warmer
get
south
Too
warm
shouldn
wonder
muttered
Sam
Frodo
But
beginning
think
time
got
sight
that
Fiery
Mountain
and
saw
the
end
the
Road
speak
thought
first
that
this
here
Redhorn
whatever
its
name
might
till
Gimli
spoke
his
piece
fair
jaw
cracker
dwarf
language
must
Maps
conveyed
nothing
Sam
mind
and
all
distances
these
strange
lands
seemed
vast
that
was
quite
out
his
reckoning
All
that
day
the
Company
remained
hiding
The
dark
birds
passed
over
now
and
again
but
the
westering
Sun
grew
red
they
disappeared
southwards
dusk
the
Company
set
out
and
turning
now
half
east
they
steered
their
course
towards
Caradhras
which
far
away
still
glowed
faintly
red
the
last
light
the
vanished
Sun
One
one
white
stars
sprang
forth
the
sky
faded
Guided
Aragorn
they
struck
good
path
looked
Frodo
like
the
remains
ancient
road
that
had
once
been
broad
and
well
planned
from
Hollin
the
mountain
pass
The
Moon
now
the
full
rose
over
the
mountains
and
cast
pale
light
which
the
shadows
stones
were
black
Many
them
looked
have
been
worked
hands
though
now
they
lay
tumbled
and
ruinous
bleak
barren
land
was
the
cold
chill
hour
before
the
first
stir
dawn
and
the
moon
was
low
Frodo
looked
the
sky
Suddenly
saw
felt
shadow
pass
over
the
high
stars
for
moment
they
faded
and
then
flashed
out
again
shivered
Did
you
see
anything
pass
over
whispered
Gandalf
who
was
just
ahead
but
felt
whatever
was
answered
may
nothing
only
wisp
thin
cloud
was
moving
fast
then
muttered
Aragorn
and
not
with
the
wind
THE

373
Nothing
further
happened
that
night
The
next
morning
dawned
even
brighter
than
before
But
the
air
was
chill
again
already
the
wind
was
turning
back
towards
the
east
For
two
more
nights
they
marched
climbing
steadily
but
ever
more
slowly
their
road
wound
into
the
hills
and
the
mountains
towered
nearer
and
nearer
the
third
morn
ing
Caradhras
rose
before
them
mighty
peak
tipped
with
snow
like
silver
but
with
sheer
naked
sides
dull
red
stained
with
blood
There
was
black
look
the
sky
and
the
sun
was
wan
The
wind
had
gone
now
round
the
north
east
Gandalf
snuffed
the
air
and
looked
back
Winter
deepens
behind
said
quietly
Aragorn
The
heights
away
north
are
whiter
than
they
were
snow
lying
far
down
their
shoulders
Tonight
shall
our
way
high
towards
the

Gate
may
well
seen
watchers
that
narrow
path
and
waylaid
some
evil
but
the
weather
may
prove
more
deadly
enemy
than
any
What
you
think
your
course
now
Aragorn
Frodo
overheard
these
words
and
understood
that
Gandalf
and
Aragorn
were
continuing
some
debate
that
had
begun
long
before
listened
anxiously
think
good
our
course
from
beginning
end
you
know
well
Gandalf
answered
Aragorn
And
perils
known
and
unknown
will
grow
But
must
and
good
our
delaying
the
passage
the

tains
Further
south
there
are
passes
till
one
comes
the

Rohan
not
trust
that
way
since
your

Saruman
Who
knows
which
side
now
the

the
Horse
lords
serve
Who
knows
indeed
said
Gandalf
But
there
another
way
and
not
the
pass
Caradhras
the
dark
and
secret
way
that
have
spoken
But
let
not
speak
again
Not
yet
Say
nothing
the
others
beg
not
until
plain
that
there
other
way
must
decide
before
further
answered
Gandalf
374
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Then
let
weigh
the
matter
our
minds
while
the
others
rest
and
sleep
said
Aragorn
the
late
afternoon
while
the
others
were
finishing
their
breakfast
Gandalf
and
Aragorn
went
aside
together
and
stood
looking
Caradhras
Its
sides
were
now
dark
and
sullen
and
its
head
was
grey
cloud
Frodo
watched
them
wondering
which
way
the
debate
would
When
they
returned
the
Company
Gandalf
spoke
and
then
knew
that
had
been
decided
face
the
weather
and
the
high
pass
was
relieved
could
not
guess
what
was
the
other
dark
and
secret
way
but
the
very
mention
had
seemed
fill
Aragorn
with
dismay
and
Frodo
was
glad
that
had
been
abandoned
From
signs
that
have
seen
lately
said
Gandalf
fear
that
the
Redhorn
Gate
may
watched
and
also
have
doubts
the
weather
that
coming
behind
Snow
may
come
must
with
all
the
speed
that
can
Even
will
take
more
than
two
marches
before
reach
the
top
the

Dark
will
come
early
this
evening
must
leave
soon
you
can
get
ready
will
add
word
advice
may
said
Boromir
was
born
under
the

the
White

and

something

the

places
shall
meet
bitter
cold
worse
before

down

When

And
Bill

said
Sam
The

looked
him
mournfully
Very
well
said
Gandalf
But
must
not
use
the
wood
not
unless
choice
between
fire
and
death
The
Company
set
out
again
with
good
speed
first
but
soon
their
way
became
steep
and
difficult
The
twisting
and
climbing
road
had
many
places
almost
disappeared
THE
RING
GOES
SOUTH
375
and
was
blocked
with
many
fallen
stones
The
night
grew
deadly
dark
under
great
clouds
bitter
wind
swirled
among
the
rocks
midnight
they
had
climbed
the
knees
the
great
mountains
The
narrow
path
now
wound
under
sheer
wall
cliffs
the
left
above
which
the
grim
flanks
Caradhras
towered
invisible
the
gloom
the
right
was
gulf
darkness
where
the
land
fell
suddenly
into
deep
ravine
Laboriously
they
climbed
sharp
slope
and
halted
for
moment
the
top
Frodo
felt
soft
touch
his
face
put
out
his
arm
and
saw
the
dim
white
flakes
snow
settling
his
sleeve
They
went
But
before
long
the
snow
was
falling
fast
filling
all
the
air
and
swirling
into
Frodo
eyes
The
dark
bent
shapes
Gandalf
and
Aragorn
only
pace
two
ahead
could
hardly
seen
don
like
this
all
panted
Sam
just
behind
Snow
all
right
fine
morning
but
like
bed
while
falling
wish
this
lot
would
off
Hobbiton
Folk
might
welcome
there
Except
the
high
moors
the
North
farthing
heavy
fall
was
rare
the
Shire
and
was
regarded
pleasant
event
and
chance
for
fun
living
hobbit
save
Bilbo
could
remember
the
Fell
Winter
when
white
wolves
invaded
the
Shire
over
the
frozen
Brandywine
Gandalf
halted
Snow
was
thick
his
hood
and
shoulders
was
already
ankle
deep
about
his
boots
This
what
feared
said
What
you
say
now
Aragorn
That
feared
too
Aragorn
answered
but
less
than
other
things
knew
the
risk
snow
though
seldom
falls
heavily
far
south
save
high
the
mountains
But
are
not
high
yet
are
still
far
down
where
the
paths
are
usually
open
all
the
winter
wonder
this
contrivance

Enemy

THE

THE

His

Gimli
can
draw
snow
down
from
the
North
trouble
here
three
hundred
leagues
away
His
arm
has

said
Gandalf
While
they
were
halted
the
wind
died
down
and
the
snow
slackened
until
almost
ceased
They
tramped
again
But
they
had
not
gone
more
than
furlong
when
the
storm
returned
with
fresh
fury
The
wind
whistled
and
the
snow
became
blinding
blizzard
Soon
even
Boromir
found
hard
keep
going
The
hobbits
bent
nearly
double
toiled
along
behind
the
taller
folk
but
was
plain
that
they
could
not
much
further
the
snow
continued
Frodo
feet
felt
like
lead
Pippin
was
dragging
behind
Even
Gimli
stout
any
dwarf
could
was
grumbling
trudged
The
Company
halted
suddenly
they
had
come
agreement
without
any
words
being
spoken
They
heard
eerie
noises
the
darkness
round
them
may
have
been
only
trick
the
wind
the
cracks
and
gullies
the
rocky
wall
but
the
sounds
were
those
shrill
cries
and
wild
howls
laughter
Stones
began
fall
from
the
mountain
side
whist
ling
over
their
heads
crashing
the
path
beside
them
Every
now
and
again
they
heard
dull
rumble
great
boulder
rolled
down
from
hidden
heights
above
cannot
further
tonight
said
Boromir
Let
those
call
the
wind
who
will
there
are
fell
voices
the
air
and
these
stones
are
aimed
call
the
wind
said
Aragorn
But
that
does
not
make
what
you
say
untrue
There
are
many
evil
and
unfriendly
things
the
world
that
have
little
love
for
those
that
two
legs
and
yet
are
not

purposes
their
own
Some

who
the
enemy
cannot
beat
off
his
attack
said
Gandalf
But
what
can
cried
Pippin
miserably
was
leaning
Merry
and
Frodo
and
was
shivering
Either
stop
where

back
said
Gandalf
good
going
Only
little
higher
remember
rightly
this
path
leaves
the
cliff
and
runs
into
wide
shallow
trough
the
bottom
long
hard
slope
should
have
shelter
there
from
snow
stones
anything
else
And
good
going
back
while
the
storm
holds
said
Aragorn
have
passed
place
the
way
that
offered
more
shelter
than
this
cliff
wall

under
now
Shelter
muttered
Sam
this
shelter
then
one
wall
and
roof
make
house
The
Company
now
gathered
together
close
the
cliff
they
could
faced
southwards
and
near
the
bottom
leaned
out
little
that
they
hoped
would
give
them
some
protection
from
the
northerly
wind
and
from
the
falling
stones
But
eddying
blasts
swirled
round
them
from
every
side
and
the
snow
flowed
down
ever
denser
clouds
They
huddled
together
with
their
backs
the
wall
Bill
the
pony
stood
patiently
but
dejectedly
front
the
hobbits
and
screened
them
little
but
before
long
the
drifting
snow
was
above
his
hocks
and
went
mounting
they
had
had
larger
companions
the
hobbits
would
soon
have
been
entirely
buried
great
sleepiness
came
over
Frodo
felt
himself
sinking
fast
into
warm
and
hazy
dream
thought
fire
was
heating
his
toes
and
out
the

the
other

Just

Pass

soon
Frodo
had

the

felt
new
strength
heart
and
the
heavy
drowsiness
left
his
limbs
The
others
also
revived
and
found
fresh
hope
and
vigour
But
the
snow
did
not
relent
whirled
about
them
thicker
than
ever
and
the
wind
blew
louder
What
you
say

asked
Boromir
suddenly
The
choice
seems
near
now
between
fire
and
death
Gandalf
Doubtless

hidden
from
all
unfriendly
eyes
when
the

but
that

not

You

make
fire
you

answered
Gandalf
there
are
any
watchers
that
can
endure
this
storm
then
they
can
see
fire
But
though
they
had

Gandalf

then
with

But
the

cared

for

friendly

Their

were
rejoiced
see
the

the

The
wood
burned
merrily
and
though
all
round
the
snow
hissed
and
pools
slush
crept
under
their

they
warmed
their

gladly
the

There

stood
stooping
circle
round
the
little
dancing
and
blow
ing
flames
red
light
was
their
tired
and
anxious
faces
behind
them
the
night
was
like
black
wall
But
the
wood
was
burning
fast
and
the
snow
still
fell
The
fire
burned
low
and
the
last
faggot
was
thrown
The
night
getting
old
said
Aragorn
The
dawn
not
far
off
any

said
Gimli
Boromir
stepped
out
the
circle
and
stared
into
the
blackness
The
snow
growing
less
said
and
the
wind
quieter
Frodo
gazed
wearily
the
flakes
still
falling
out
the
dark
revealed
white
for
moment
the
light
the
dying
fire
but
for
long
time
could
see
sign
their
slacken
ing
Then
suddenly
sleep
was
beginning
creep
over
him
again
was
aware
that
the
wind
had
indeed
fallen
and
the
flakes
were
becoming
larger
and
fewer
Very
slowly
dim
light
began
grow
last
the
snow
stopped
altogether
the
light
grew
stronger
showed
silent
shrouded
world
Below
their
refuge
were
white
humps
and
domes
and
shapeless
deeps
beneath
which
the
path
that
they
had
trodden
was
altogether
lost
but
the
heights
above
were
hidden
great
clouds
still
heavy
with
the
threat
snow
Gimli
looked
and
shook
his
head
Caradhras
has
not
forgiven
said
has
more
snow
yet
fling
The
sooner
back
and
down
the
better
this
all
agreed
but
their
retreat
was
now
difficult
might
well
prove
impossible
Only
few
paces
from
the
ashes
their
fire
the
snow
lay
many
feet
deep
higher
than
the
heads
the
hobbits
places
had
been
scooped
and
piled
the
wind
into
great
drifts
against
the
cliff
Gandalf
would
before
with
bright
flame
might
melt

you
said
Legolas
The
storm
had
troubled
him
little
and
alone
the

remained

Elves
could
fly
over

answered
Gandalf
But
must
have
something
work

Well
said
Boromir
when

bodies

country
The
strongest
must
seek
way
See
Though
all
now
snow
clad
our
path
came
turned
about
that
shoulder
rock
down
yonder
was
there
that
the
snow
first
began
burden
could
reach
that
point
maybe
would
prove
easier
beyond
more
than
furlong
off
guess
Then
let
force
path
thither
you
and
said
Aragorn
Aragorn
was
the
tallest
the
Company
but
Boromir
little
less
height
was
broader
and
heavier
build
led
the
way
and
Aragorn
followed
him
Slowly
they
moved
off
and
were
soon
toiling
heavily
places
the
snow
was
breast
high
and
often
Boromir
seemed
swimming
burrowing
with
his
great
arms
rather
than
walking
Legolas
watched
them
for
while
with
smile
upon
his
lips
and
then
turned
the
others
The
strongest
must
seek
way
say
you
But
say
let
ploughman
plough
but
choose
otter
for
swimming
and
for
running
light
over
grass
and
leaf
over
snow
Elf
With
that
sprang
forth
nimbly
and
then
Frodo
noticed
for
the
first
time
though
had
long
known
that
the
Elf
had
boots
but
wore
only
light
shoes
always
did
and
his
feet
made
little
imprint
the
snow
Farewell
said
Gandalf
find
the
Sun
Then
swift
runner
over
firm
sand
shot
away
and
quickly
overtaking
the
toiling
men
with
wave
his
hand
passed
them
and
sped
into
the
distance
and
vanished
round
the
rocky
turn
The
others
waited
huddled
together
watching
until
Boromir
and
Aragorn
dwindled
into
black
specks
the
whiteness
length
they
too
passed
from
sight
The
time
dragged
The

lowered
and
now

came
curling
down
again

maybe
went

and
then
last
they
saw
Legolas
coming
back
the
same
time
Boromir
and
Aragorn
reappeared
round
the
bend
far
behind
him
and
came
labouring

There
the

drift
all
just
beyond

and
there
our
Strong
Men
were
almost
buried
They
despaired
until
returned
and
told
them
that
the
drift
was
little
wider
than

And
the
other
side
the
snow
suddenly
grows
less
while
further
down

growled
Gimli

the

Caradhras
does
not

Elves
and
Dwarves
and
that
drift
was
laid
cut
off
our
escape
But
happily
your
Caradhras
has
forgotten
that
you
have
Men
with
you
said
Boromir
who
came
that
moment
And
doughty
Men
too
may
say
though
lesser

with

might
have

Still

Pippin
voicing

Have

Boromir

but
still

some

left
and
Aragorn

The

Come

lifted

said
and
strode
forward
Aragorn
with
Merry
came
behind
Pippin
marvelled
his
strength
seeing
the
passage
that
had
already
forced
with
other
tool
than
his
great
limbs
Even
now
burdened
was
was
widening
the
track
for
those
who
followed
thrusting

They

THE

THE

the
mountain
path
like
sheer
and
sudden
wall
and
its
crest
sharp
shaped
with
knives
reared
more
than
twice
the
height
Boromir
but
through
the
middle
passage
had
been
beaten
rising
and
falling
like
bridge
the
far
side
Merry
and
Pippin
were
set
down
and
there
they
waited
with
Legolas
for
the
rest
the
Company
arrive
After
while
Boromir
returned
carrying
Sam
Behind
the
narrow
but
now
well
trodden
track
came
Gandalf
leading
Bill
with
Gimli
perched
among
the
baggage
Last
came
Aragorn
carrying
Frodo
They
passed
through
the
lane
but
hardly
had
Frodo
touched
the
ground
when
with
deep
rumble
there
rolled
down
fall
stones
and
slithering
snow
The
spray
half
blinded
the
Company
they
crouched
against
the
cliff
and
when
the
air
cleared
again
they
saw
that
the
path
was
blocked
behind
them
Enough
enough
cried
Gimli
are
departing
quickly
may
And
indeed
with
that
last
stroke
the
malice
the
mountain
seemed
expended
Caradhras
was
satisfied
that
the
invaders
had
been
beaten
off
and
would
not
dare
return
The
threat
snow
lifted
the
clouds
began
break
and
the
light
grew
broader
Legolas
had
reported
they
found
that
the
snow
became
steadily
more
shallow
they
went
down
that
even
the
hobbits
could
trudge
along
Soon
they
all
stood
once
more
the
flat
shelf
the
head
the
steep
slope
where
they
had
felt
the
first
flakes
snow
the
night
before
The
morning
was
now
far
advanced
From
the
high
place
they
looked
back
westwards
over
the
lower

Far
away
the
tumble
country
that
lay
the

the

was
the

from
which
they
had
started

the

Frodo
legs
ached
was
chilled
the

and
hungry
and
his

was
dizzy
thought
the
long

painful
march
downhill
Black
specks
swam
before
his

rubbed
them
but
the
black
specks
remained
the

below
him
but
still
high

THE

the

They

The

snarled
and
sprang
towards
them
with
great
leap
that

there
was
sharp
twang
Legolas
had
loosed
his
bow
There
was
hideous
yell
and
the

thudded
the

the
Elvish
arrow
had
pierced
its

The
watching

were
suddenly
extinguished
Gandalf
and
Aragorn
strode
forward

All
about

More

Through
the

one
huge

Aragorn
passed
his

Boromir

Beside

Gimli

Together

The

lain
along

the

that
ran
out
from

But

The

still
the

Nowhere
could
they
see
any

All
was
bleak
and
dry
Their

not

but
what
the

none

Suddenly

Come

The
Company
were
footsore
and
tired
but
they
trudged
doggedly
along
the
rough
and
winding
track
for
many
miles
The
sun
turned
from
the
noon
and
began
west
After
brief
halt
and
hasty
meal
they
went
again
Before
them
the
mountains
frowned
but
their
path
lay
deep
trough
land
and
they
could
see
only
the
higher
shoulders
and
the

There

turned

went
due

again
Rounding
the
corner
they
saw
before
them

cliff
some
five
fathoms
high
with
broken
and
jagged

Over
trickling
water
dripped
through

Before

Neither

surface
The

had

The

was
drawing
its
end
and
cold
stars
were
glinting
the
sky
high
above
the
sunset
when
the
Company
with
all

they
could
climbed
the
slopes
and
reached
the
side
the
lake
breadth
looked
more
than
two
three
furlongs
the
widest
point
How
far
stretched
away
southward
they
could
not
see
the
failing
light
but
its
northern
end
was
more
than
half
mile
from
where
they
stood
and
between
the
stony
ridges
that
enclosed
the
valley

the

the

two
before
they
could
reach
the
point
the
far
shore
that
Gandalf
was
making
for
and
then
had
still

When
they
came
the
northernmost
corner
the
lake
they
found
narrow
creek
that
barred
their
way
was
green
and
stagnant
thrust
out
like
slimy
arm
towards
the
enclos
ing
hills
Gimli
strode
forward
undeterred
and
found
that
the
water
was
shallow
more
than
ankle
deep
the
edge
Behind
him
they
walked
file
threading
their
way
with
care
for
under
the
weedy
pools
were
sliding
and

stones
and
footing
was

Frodo

Turning
quickly
they
saw
ripples
black
edged
with
shadow
the
waning
light
great
rings
were
widening
outwards
from
point
far
out
the
lake
There
was
bub
bling
noise
and
then
silence
The
dusk
deepened
and
the
last
gleams
the
sunset
were
veiled
cloud
Gandalf
now
pressed
great
pace
and
the
others
followed
quickly
they
could
They
reached
the
strip
dry
land
between
the
lake
and
the
cliffs
was
narrow
often
hardly
dozen
yards
across
and
encumbered
with
fallen
rock
and
stones
but
they
found
way
hugging
the
cliff
and
keeping
far
from
the
dark
water
they
might
mile
southwards
along
the
shore
they
came
upon
holly
trees
Stumps
and
dead
boughs
were
rotting
the
shallows
the
remains
seemed
old
thickets
hedge
that
had
once
lined
the
road
across
the
drowned
valley
But
close
under
the
cliff
there
stood
still
strong
and
living
two
tall
trees
larger
than
any
trees
holly
that
Frodo
had
ever
seen
imagined
Their
great
roots
spread
from
the
wall
the
water
Under
the
looming
cliffs
they
had
looked
like
mere
bushes
when
seen
far
off
from
the
top
the
Stair
but
now
they
towered
overhead
stiff
dark
and
silent
throwing
deep
night
shadows

The

surface
where
the

hands
had
passed
faint
lines
appeared
like
slender
veins
silver
running
the

first
they
were
more
than
pale
gossamer
threads
fine
that
they
only
twinkled
fitfully
where
the
Moon
caught
them
but
steadily
they
grew
broader
and
clearer
until
their

could

the

Below

surmounted

with
seven

Beneath
these
again
were
two

each
bearing

More
clearly
than

there
shone
forth

They

touched
one
who
speaks

now
long

Middle

long
since
heard

and
thought
deeply
before

What
does
the

asked
Frodo
who
was
trying

the

the

The

only
Aragorn
who

remained
silent
and
unmoved
Then
what
was
the
use
bringing
this
accursed
spot
cried
Boromir
glancing
back
with
shudder
the
dark
water
You
told
that

How
could
that

The

your

Boromir
said
the

ard
that

But

And
added
with
glint
his
eyes
under
their
bristling
brows
you
may
ask
what
the

and
shall
not

Gimli
for

the

tongue
that

The
opening
words
were
Elvish
like
the
writing
the
arch
that
seems
certain
stepped
the

again
and
lightly
touched
with

Annon

The

faded
but
the

did
not
stir
Many
times
repeated
these
words
different
order
varied
them
Then
tried
other
spells
one
after
another
speaking
now
faster
and
louder
now
soft
and
slow
Then
spoke
many
single
words
Elvish
speech
Nothing

pened
The
cliff
towered
into
the
night
the
countless
stars
were
kindled
the
wind
blew
cold
and
the
doors
stood
fast
Again
Gandalf
approached
the
wall
and
lifting
his
arms
spoke
tones
command
and
rising
wrath
Edro

cried
and
struck
the
rock
with
his

Open

shouted
and
followed
with
the
same
command
every
language
that
had
ever
been
spoken
the
West
Middle

Then
threw
his
staff
the
ground
and
sat
down
silence
that
moment
from
far
off
the
wind
bore
their
listening
ears
the
howling
wolves
Bill
the

started
fear
and
Sam
sprang
his

and
whispered
softly
him
not

How
hate
this

there
was
swish
and
bubble
Great
rippling
rings
formed
the
surface
out
beyond
where
the
stone
had
fallen
and
they
moved
slowly
towards
the
foot
the
cliff
Why
did
you
that
Boromir
said
Frodo

this

too
and

Why

said
Pippin
Gandalf
took
notice
them
sat
with
his

bowed

despair
anxious
thought
The
mournful
howling
the
wolves
was
heard
again
The
ripples
the
water
grew
and
came
closer
some
were
already
lapping
the
shore
With
suddenness
that
startled
them
all
the
wizard
sprang
his
feet
was
laughing
have
cried
course
course
Absurdly
simple
like
most
riddles
when
you
see
the
answer
Picking
his
staff
stood
before
the
rock
and
said
clear
voice
Mellon
The
star
shone
out
briefly
and
faded
again
Then
silently
great
doorway
was
outlined
though
not
crack
joint
had
been
visible
before
Slowly
divided
the
middle
and
swung
outwards
inch
inch
until
both
doors
lay
back
against
the
wall
Through
the
opening
shadowy
stair
could
seen
climbing
steeply
but
beyond
the
lower
steps
the
darkness
was
deeper
than
the
night
The
Company
stared
wonder
was
wrong
after
all
said
Gandalf
and
Gimli
too
Merry
all
people
was
the
right
track
The
opening
word
was
inscribed
the
archway
all
the
time
The
translation
should
have
been
Say
Friend
and
enter
had
only
speak
the
Elvish
word
for
friend
and
the
doors
opened
Quite
simple
Too
simple
for
learned
lore
master
these
suspicious
days
Those
were
happier
times
Now
let
strode
forward
and
set
his
foot
the
lowest
step
But
that
moment
several
things
happened
Frodo

something
seize
him
the
ankle
and
fell
with
cry
Bill
the
pony
gave
wild
neigh
fear
and
turned
tail
and
dashed
away
along
the
lakeside
into
the
darkness
Sam
leaped
after
him
and
then
hearing
Frodo
cry
ran
back
again
weeping
and
cursing
The
others
swung
round
and
saw
the
waters
the
lake
seething
host
snakes
were
swimming
from
the
southern
end
Out
from
the
water
long
sinuous
tentacle
had
crawled
was
pale
green
and
luminous
and
wet
Its
fingered
end
had
hold
Frodo
foot
and
was
dragging
him
into
the
water
Sam
his
knees
was
now
slashing
with
knife
The
arm
let
Frodo
and
Sam
pulled
him
away
crying
out
for
help
Twenty
other
arms
came
rippling
out
The
dark
water
boiled
and
there
was
hideous
stench
Into
the
gateway
the
stairs
Quick
shouted
Gandalf
leaping
back
Rousing
them
from
the
horror
that
seemed
have
rooted
all
but
Sam
the
ground
where
they
stood
drove
them
forward
They
were
just
time
Sam
and
Frodo
were
only
few
steps
and
Gandalf
had
just
begun
climb
when
the
groping
tentacles
writhed
across
the
narrow
shore
and
fin
gered
the
cliff
wall
and
the
doors
One
came
wriggling
over
the
threshold
glistening
the
starlight
Gandalf
turned
and
paused
was
considering
what
word
would
close
the
gate
again
from
within
there
was
need
Many
coiling
arms
seized
the
doors
either
side
and
with
horrible
strength
swung
them
round
With
shattering
echo
they
slammed
and
all
light
was
lost
noise
rending
and
crashing
came
dully
through
the
ponderous
stone
Sam
clinging
Frodo
arm
collapsed
step
the
black

Poor

Bill
said
choking
voice
Poor

Wolves
and
snakes
But
the
snakes
were
too
much
for
him
had
choose
Frodo
had
come
with
you
They
heard
Gandalf
back
down
the
steps
and
thrust
his
staff
against
the
doors
There
was
quiver
the
stone
and
the
stairs
trembled
but
the
doors
did
not
open

The

and
there
only

out
the

the

fear
from
the
sounds
that
boulders
have
been
piled
and
the

uprooted
and
thrown
across
the
gate
sorry
for
the
trees
were
beautiful
and
had
stood
long
felt
that
something
horrible
was
near
from
the
moment
that
foot
first
touched
the
water
said
Frodo
What
was
the
thing
were
there
many
them
not

answered
Gandalf
but
the
arms
were
all
guided
one
purpose

Ores
the

did
not
speak
aloud
his
thought
that
whatever
was
that
dwelt
the
lake
had
seized
Frodo
first
among
all
the
Company
Boromir
muttered
under
his
breath
but
the
echoing
stone
magnified
the
sound
hoarse
whisper
that
all
could
hear

And
thither

the
wizard
passed
ahead
the
great
steps
held
his
staff
aloft
and
from
its
tip
there
came
faint
radiance
The
wide
stairway
was
sound
and
undamaged
Two
hundred
steps
they
counted
broad
and
shallow
and
the
top
they
found
arched

said
Frodo
had
begun
shake
off
the
terror
the
clutching
arm
and
suddenly
felt
extremely
hungry
The
proposal
was
welcomed
all
and
they
sat
down
the
upper
steps
dim
figures
the
gloom
After
they
had
eaten
Gandalf
gave
them

till
come
down
into
Dimrill
Dale
How
long
that
going
take
asked
Frodo
cannot
say
answered
Gandalf
depends
many
chances
But
going
straight
without

losing
our
way
shall
take
three
four
marches
expect
cannot
less
than
forty
miles
from
West

and
the
road
may
wind

After
only
brief
rest
they
started
their
way
again
All
were
eager
get
the
journey
over
quickly
possible
and
were
willing
tired
they
were
marching
still
for
several
hours
Gandalf
walked
front
before
his
left
hand
held
his
glimmering
staff
the
light
which
just
showed
the
ground
before
his
feet
his
right
held
his
sword
Glamdring
Behind
him
came
Gimli
his
eyes
glinting
the
dim
light
turned
his
head
from
side
side
Behind
the
dwarf
walked
Frodo
and
had
drawn
the
short
sword
Sting
gleam
came
from
the
blades
Sting
Glamdring
and
that
was
some
comfort
for
being
the
work
Elvish
smiths
the
Elder
Days
these
swords
shone
with
cold
light
any
Ores
were
near
hand
Behind
Frodo
went
Sam
and
after
him
Legolas
and
the
young
hobbits
and
Boromir
the
dark
the
rear
grim
and
silent
walked
Aragorn
The
passage
twisted
round
few
turns
and
then
began
descend
went
steadily
down
for
long
while
before
became
level
once
again
The
air
grew
hot
and
stifling
but
was
not
foul
and
times
they
felt
currents
cooler
air
upon
their
faces
issuing
from
half
guessed
openings
the
walls
There
were
many
these
the
pale
ray
the

Frodo
caught
glimpses

passages
and
tunnels
sloping
running
steeply
down
opening
blankly
dark
either
side
was
bewildering
beyond
hope
remembering
Gimli
aided
Gandalf
very
little
except
his
stout
courage
least
was
not
were
most
the
others
troubled
the
mere
darkness
itself
Often
the
wizard
consulted
him
points
where
the
choice
way
was
doubtful
but
was
always
Gandalf
who
had
the
final
word
The
Mines
Moria
were
vast
and
intricate
beyond
the
imagination
Gimli
Gloin

Gandalf

long
before
were
now
little

but
even
the
gloom
and
despite
all
windings
the
road
knew
whither
wished
and
did
not
falter
long
there
was
path
that
led
towards
his
goal
not
afraid
said
Aragorn
There
was
pause
longer
than
usual
and
Gandalf
and
Gimli
were
whispering
together
the
others
were
crowded
behind
waiting
anxiously
not
afraid
have
been
with
him
many

never

and
there
are
tales
Rivendell
greater
deeds
his
than
any
that
have
seen
will
not
astray
there
any
path

has
led
here
against
our
fears
but
will
lead
out
again
whatever
cost
himself
surer
finding
the
way
home
blind
night
than

Queen
Beruthiel
was
well
for
the
Company
that
they
had
such
guide
They
had
fuel
nor
any
means
malting
torches
the
desperate
scramble
the
doors
many
things
had
been
left
behind
But
without
any
light
they
would
soon
have
come
grief
There
were
not
only
many
roads
choose
from
there
were
also
many
places
holes
and
pitfalls
and
dark
wells
beside
the
path
which
their
passing
feet
echoed
There
were
fissures
and
chasms
the
walls
and
floor
and
every
now
and
then
crack
would
open
right
before
their
feet
The
widest
was
more
than
seven
feet
across
and
was
long
before
Pippin
could
summon
enough
courage
leap
over
406
the
fellowship
the
ring
the
dreadful
gap
The
noise
churning
water
came
from
far
below
some
great
mill
wheel
was
turning
the
depths
Rope
muttered
Sam
knew
want
hadn
got
these
dangers
became
more
frequent
their
march
became
slower
Already
they
seemed
have
been
tramping
endlessly
the
mountains
roots
They
were
more
than
weary
and
yet
there
seemed
comfort
the
thought
halting
anywhere
Frodo
spirits
had
risen
for
while
after
his
escape
and
after
food
and
draught
the
cordial
but
now
deep
uneasiness
growing
dread
crept
over
him
again
Though
had
been
healed
Rivendell
the
knife
stroke
that
grim
wound
had
not
been
without
effect
His
senses
were
sharper
and
more
aware
things
that
could
not
seen
One
sign
change
that
soon
had
noticed
was
that
could
see
more
the
dark
than
any
his
com
panions
save
perhaps
Gandalf
And
was
any
case
the
bearer
the
Ring
hung
upon
its
chain
against
his
breast
and
whiles
seemed
heavy
weight
felt
the
certainty
evil
ahead
and
evil
following
but
said
nothing
gripped
tighter
the
hilt
his
sword
and
went
doggedly
The
Company
behind
him
spoke
seldom
and
then
only
hurried
whispers
There
was
sound
but
the
sound
their
own
feet
the
dull
stump
Gimli
dwarf
boots
the
heavy
tread
Boromir
the
light
step
Legolas
the
soft
scarce
heard
patter
hobbit
feet
and
the
rear
the
slow
firm
footfalls
Aragorn
with
his
long
stride
When
they
halted
for
moment
they
heard
nothing
all
unless
were
occasionally
faint
trickle
and
drip
unseen
water
Yet
Frodo
began
hear
imagine
that
heard
something
else
like
the
faint
fall
soft
bare
feet
was
never
loud
enough
near
enough
for
him
feel
certain
that
heard
but
once
had
started
never
stopped
while
the
Company
was
moving
But
was
not
echo
for
when
they
halted
pattered
for
little
all
itself
and
then
grew
still
JOURNEY
THE

407
was
after
nightfall
when
they
had
entered
the
Mines
They
had
been
going
for
several
hours
with
only
brief
halts
when
Gandalf
came
his
first
serious
check
Before
him
stood
wide
dark
arch
opening
into
three
passages
all
led
the
same
general
direction
eastwards
but
the
left
hand
pass
age
plunged
down
while
the
right
hand
climbed
and
the
middle
way
seemed
run
smooth
and
level
but
very
narrow
have
memory
this
place
all
said
Gandalf
stand
ing
uncertainly
under
the
arch
held
his
staff
the
hope
finding
some
marks
inscription
that
might
help
his
choice
but
nothing
the
kind
was
seen
too
weary
decide
said
shaking
his
head
And
expect
that
you
are
all
weary
wearier
had
better
halt
here
for
what
left
the
night
You
know
what
mean
here
ever
dark
but
outside
the
late
Moon
riding
westward
and
the
middle
night
has
passed
Poor

the

found

was
half
closed
but
swung
back
easily
gentle
thrust
Beyond
there
seemed
lie
wide
chamber
cut
the
rock
Steady
Steady
cried
Gandalf
Merry
and
Pippin
pushed
forward
glad
find
place
where
they
could
rest
with

more
feeling

than
the
open
passage
Steady
You

went
cautiously
and
the
others
filed
behind
There
said
pointing
with
his
staff
the
middle
the
floor
Before
his
feet
they
saw
large
round
hole
like
the
mouth
well
Broken
and
rusty
chains
lay
the
edge
and
trailed
down
into
the
black
pit
Fragments

lay
near
One

might
have

and
still
wondering
when

Aragorn
Merry

This

Gimli
That

with
stone

the
fellowship
the

But
the
lid
broken
and
must
all
take
care
the
dark
Pippin
felt
curiously
attracted
the
well
While
the
others
were
unrolling
blankets
and
malting
beds
against
the
walls
the
chamber
far
possible
from
the
hole
the
floor
crept
the
edge
and
peered
over
chill
air
seemed
strike
his
face
rising
from
invisible
depths
Moved
sudden
impulse
groped
for
loose
stone
and
let
drop
felt
his
heart
beat
many
times
before
there
was
any
sound
Then
far
below
the
stone
had
fallen
into
deep
water
some
cavernous
place
there
came
plunk
very
distant
but
magni
fied
and
repeated
the
hollow
shaft
What
that
cried
Gandalf
was
relieved
when
Pippin
confessed
what
had
done
but
was
angry
and
Pippin
could
see
his
eye
glinting
Fool
Took
growled
This

Throw
yourself
next
time
and
then

Now
quiet
Nothing
more
was
heard
for
several
minutes
but
then
there
came
out
the
depths
faint
knocks
tom
tap

They
stopped
and
when
the
echoes
had
died
away
they
were
repeated
tap
tom
tom

They
sounded
disquietingly
like
signals
some
sort
but
after
while
the
knocking
died
away
and
was
not
heard
again
That
was
the
sound
hammer
have
never

Gimli
Yes
said
Gandalf
and
not
like
may
have
nothing

probably
something
has

that
would

Pray

Pippin
sat
miserably
the
door
the

but
kept
turning
round
fearing
that
some
unknown
thing
would
crawl
out
the
well
wished
could
cover
the
hole
only
with
blanket
but
dared
not
move
near
even
though
Gandalf
seemed
asleep
JOURNEY
THE
DARK
409
Actually
Gandalf
was
awake
though
lying
still
and
silent
was
deep
thought
trying
recall
every
memory
his
former
journey
the
Mines
and
considering
anxiously
the
next
course
that
should
take
false
turn
now
might
disastrous
After
hour
rose
and
came
over
Pippin
Get
into
corner
and
have
sleep
lad
said
kindly
tone
You

the

know
what
the

with
muttered
sat
down
the
door
need

have
not
tasted
since
the
morning
before
the
snowstorm
The
last
thing
that
Pippin
saw
sleep
took
him
was
dark
glimpse
the
old
wizard
huddled
the
floor
shielding
glowing
chip
his
gnarled
hands
between
his
knees
The
flicker
for
moment
showed
his
sharp
nose
and
the
puff
smoke
was
Gandalf
who
roused
them
all
from
sleep
had
sat
and
watched
all
alone
for
about
six
hours
and
had
let
the
others
rest
And
the
watches
have
made

said

not

time
began
climb
again
For
eight
dark
hours
not
counting
two
brief
halts
they
marched
and
they
met
danger
and
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
but
the
faint
gleam
the
wizard
light
bobbing
like
will
the
wisp
front
them
The
passage
they
had
chosen
wound
steadily
upwards
far
they
could
judge
went
great
mounting
curves
and
rose
grew
loftier
and
wider
There
were
now
openings
other
galleries
tunnels
either
side
and
the
floor
was
level
and
sound
without
pits
cracks
Evidently
they
had
struck
what
once
had
been
important
road
and
they
went
forward
quicker
than
they
had
done

first
march

Frodo

rose

but
still

and
still
times

heard

behind
the
Company
and
beyond
the
fall
and
patter
their
feet
following
foot

that
was
not

They
had
marched
far
the
hobbits
could
endure
without
rest
and
all
were
thinking
place
where
they
could
sleep
when
suddenly
the
walls
right
and
left
van
ished
They
seemed
have
passed
through
some
arched
doorway
into
black
and
empty
space
There
was
great
draught
warmer
air
behind
them
and
before
them
the
darkness
was
cold
their
faces
They
halted
and
crowded
anxiously
together
Gandalf
seemed
pleased
chose
the

raised
his
staff
and
for
brief
instant
there
was
blaze
like
flash
lightning
Great
shadows
sprang
and
fled
and
for
second
they
saw
vast
roof
far
above
their
heads
upheld
many
mighty
pillars
hewn
stone
Before
them
and
either
side
stretched
huge
empty
hall
its
black
walls
polished
and
smooth
glass
flashed
and
glittered
Three
other
entrances
they
saw
dark
black
arches
one
straight
before
them
eastwards
and
one
either
side
Then
the
light
went
out
That

Gandalf
There

through
the

All
about
them
they
lay
hung
the
dark
ness
hollow
and
immense
and
they
were
oppressed
the
loneliness
and
vastness
the
dolven
halls
and
endlessly
branching
stairs
and
passages
The
wildest
imaginings
that
dark
rumour
had
ever
suggested
the

fell
altogether

the

wealth
Moria
was
not
gold
and
jewels
the
toys
the
Dwarves
nor
iron
their
servant
Such
things
they
found
here
true
especially
iron
but
they
did
not
need
delve
for
them
all
things
that
they
desired
they
could
obtain
traffic
For
here
alone
the
world
was
found
Moria
silver
true
silver
some
have
called
mithril
the
Elvish
name
The
Dwarves
have
name
which
they
not
tell
Its
worth
was
ten
times
that
gold
and
now
beyond
price
for
little
left
above
ground
and
even
the
Ores
dare
not
delve
here
for
The
lodes
lead
away
north
towards
Caradhras
and
down
darkness
The
Dwarves
tell
tale
but
even
mithril
was
the
foundation
their
wealth
also
was
their
destruction
they
delved
too
greedily
and
too
deep
and
disturbed
that
from
which
they
fled
Durin
Bane
what
they
brought
light
the
Ores
have
gathered
nearly
all
and
given
tribute
Sauron
who
covets
Mithril
All
folk
desired
could
beaten
like
copper
and
polished
like
glass
and
the
Dwarves
could
make
metal
light
and
yet
harder
than
tempered
steel
Its
beauty

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
was
like
that
common
silver
but
the
beauty
mithril
did
not
tarnish
grow
dim
The
Elves
dearly
loved
and
among
many
uses
they
made

you
saw

That

kingly
gift
Yes
said
Gandalf
never
told
him
but
its
worth
was
greater
than
the
value
the
whole
Shire
and
everything
Frodo
said
nothing
but
put
his
hand
under
his
tunic
and
touched
the
rings
his
mail
shirt
felt
staggered
think
that
had
been
walking
about
with
the
price
the
Shire
under
his
jacket
Had
Bilbo
known
felt
doubt
that
Bilbo
knew
quite
well
was
indeed
kingly
gift
But
now
his
thoughts
had
been
carried
away
from

dark
Mines

and
Bag
End
the
days
while
Bilbo
was
still
there
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
was
back
there
and
those
days
mowing

pottering
among
the
flowers
and
that
had
never
heard

deep
silence

One

were
breath
that
came
through

doors
out
deep

dread
came
over
him
His
hands
were
cold
and
his
brow
damp
listened
All
his
mind
was
given
listening
and
nothing
else
for
two
slow
hours
but
heard
sound
not
even
the
imagined
echo
footfall
His
watch
was
nearly
over
when
far
off
where
guessed
that
the
western
archway
stood
fancied
that
could
see
two
pale
points

almost
like
luminous
eyes
started
His

415
When
lay
down
quickly
went
sleep
but
seemed
him
that
the
dream
went
heard
whispers
and
saw
the
two
pale
points
light
approaching
slowly
woke
and
found
that
the
others
were
speaking
softly
near
him
and
that
dim
light
was
falling
his
face
High
above
the
eastern
archway
through
shaft
near
the
roof
came
long
pale
gleam
and
across
the
hall
through
the
northern
arch
light
also
glimmered
faint
and
distantly
Frodo
sat
Good

Gandalf
For

doubt
now
that

ever
came
here
After
they
had
breakfasted
Gandalf
decided
again

tired

shall
rest

said
think
that
none
will

said
Boromir
Which
way
shall
take
Yonder
eastward
arch
Maybe
said
Gandalf
But
not
know
yet
exactly
where
are
Unless
quite
astray
guess
that
are
above
and
the
north
the
Great
Gates
and
may
not
easy
find
the
right
road
down
them
The
eastern
arch
will
probably
prove
the
way
that
must
take
but
before
make
our
minds
ought
look
about
Let
towards
that
light
the

fear
that
the

Following

the
Company

They

themselves

The

retreated
the

But
they
had
chance

There
was
blow
the

made
quiver

then
began

Suddenly
and
his

Frodo
felt
hot

his
heart
The

cried
and
springing
beside
Boromir
stooped
and
stabbed
with
Sting
the
hideous
foot
There
was
bellow
and
the
foot
jerked
back
nearly
wrenching
Sting
from
Frodo
arm
Black
drops
dripped
from

smoked

Boromir
hurled
himself

struck

and
fell
harmlessly
the

There
was
horn

How

and
had
felled
his
ore
sturdy
thrust
with
his
Barrow
blade
fire
was
smouldering
his
brown
eyes
that
would
have
made
Ted
Sandyman
step
backwards
had
seen
Now
the
time
cried
Gandalf
Let
before
the
troll
returns
But
even
they
retreated
and
before
Pippin
and
Merry
had
reached
the
stair
outside
huge
orc
chieftain
almost
man
high
clad
black
mail
from
head
foot
leaped
into
the
chamber
behind
him
his
followers
clustered
the
door
way
His
broad
flat
face
was
swart
his
eyes
were
like
coals
and
his
tongue
was
red
wielded
great
spear
With
thrust
his
huge
hide
shield
turned
Boromir
sword
and
bore
him
backwards
throwing
him
the
ground
Diving
under
Aragorn
blow
with
the
speed
striking
snake
424
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
charged
into
the
Company
and
thrust
with
his
spear
straight
Frodo
The
blow
caught
him
the
right
side
and
Frodo
was
hurled
against
the
wall
and
pinned
Sam
with
cry
hacked
the
spear
shaft
and
broke
But
even
the
ore
flung
down
the
truncheon
and
swept
out
his
scimitar
Anduril
came
down
upon
his
helm
There
was
flash
like
flame
and
the
helm
burst
asunder
The
ore
fell
with
cloven
head
His
followers
fled
howling
Boromir
and
Aragorn
sprang
them
Doom
doom
went
the
drums
the
deep
The
great
voice
rolled
out
again
Now
shouted
Gandalf
Now
the
last
chance
Run
for
Aragorn
picked
Frodo
where
lay
the
wall
and
made
for
the
stair
pushing
Merry
and
Pippin
front
him
The
others
followed
but
Gimli
had
dragged
away
Legolas
spite
the
peril
lingered
Balin
tomb
with
his
head
bowed
Boromir
hauled
the
eastern
door
grinding
upon
its
hinges
had
great
iron
rings
either
side
but
could
not
fastened
all
right
gasped
Frodo
can
walk
Put
down
Aragorn
nearly
dropped
him
his
amazement
thought
you
were
dead
cried
Not
yet
said
Gandalf
But
there
time
for
wonder
Off
you
all
you
down
the
stairs
Wait
few
minutes
for
the
bottom
but
not
come
soon
quickly
and
choose
paths
leading
right
and
downwards
cannot
leave
you
hold
the
door
alone
said
Aragorn
say
said
Gandalf
fiercely
Swords
are
more
use
here
The
passage
was
lit
shaft
and
was
utterly
dark
They
groped
their
way
down
long
flight
steps
and
then
looked
back
but
they
could
see
nothing
except
high
above
them
the
faint
glimmer
the
wizard
staff
seemed
still
standing
guard
the
closed
door
Frodo
breathed
heavily
THE
BRIDGE
KHAZAD
DUM
425
and
leaned
against
Sam
who
put
his
arms
about
him
They
stood
peering
the
stairs
into
the
darkness
Frodo
thought
could
hear
the
voice
Gandalf
above
muttering
words
that
ran
down
the
sloping
roof
with
sighing
echo
could
not
catch
what
was
said
The
walls
seemed
trembling
Every
now
and
again
the
drum
beats
throbbed
and
rolled
doom
doom
Suddenly
the
top
the
stair
there
was
stab
white
light
Then
there
was
dull
rumble
and
heavy
thud
The
drum
beats
broke
out
wildly
doom
boom
doom
boom
and
then
stopped
Gandalf
came
flying
down
the
steps
and
fell
the
ground
the
midst
the
Company
Well
well
That
over
said
the
wizard
struggling
his
feet
have
done
all
that
could
But
have
met
match
and
have
nearly
been
destroyed
But
don
stand
here
You
will
have
without
light
for
while
rather
shaken
Where
are
you
Gimli
Come
ahead
with
Keep
close
behind
all
you
They
stumbled
after
him
wondering
what
had
happened
Doom
doom
went
the
drum
beats
again
they
now
sounded
muffled
and
far
away
but
they
were
following
There
was
other
sound
pursuit
neither
tramp
feet
nor
any
voice
Gandalf
took
turns
right
left
for
the
passage
seemed
going
the
direction
that
desired
Every
now
and
again
descended
flight
steps
fifty
more
lower
level
the
moment
that
was
their
chief
danger
for
the
dark
they
could
not
see
descent
until
they
came
and
put
their
feet
out
into
emptiness
Gandalf
felt
the
ground
with
his
staff
like
blind
man
the
end
hour
they
had
gone
mile
maybe
little
more
and
had
descended
many
flights
stairs
There
was
still
sound
pursuit
Almost
they
began
hope
that
they
would
escape
the
bottom
the
seventh
flight
Gandalf
halted
getting
hot
gasped
ought
down
least
the
level
the
Gates
now
Soon
think
should
look
426
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
for
left
hand
turn
take
east
hope
not
far
very
weary
must
rest
here
moment
even
all
the
ores
ever
spawned
are
after
Gimli
took
his
arm
and
helped
him
down
seat
the
step
What
happened
away
there
the
door
asked
Did
you
meet
the
beater
the
drums
not
know
answered
Gandalf
But
found
myself
suddenly
faced
something
that
have
not
met
before
could
think
nothing
but
try
and
put
shutting
spell
the
door
know
many
but
things
that
kind
rightly
requires
time
and
even
then
the
door
can
broken
strength
stood
there
could
hear
orc
voices
the
other
side
any
moment
thought
they
would
burst
open
could
not
hear
what
was
said
they
seemed
talking
their
own
hideous
language
All
caught
was
ghask
that
fire
Then
something
came
into
the
chamber
felt
through
the
door
and
the
ores
themselves
were
afraid
and
fell
silent
laid
hold
the
iron
ring
and
then
perceived
and
spell
What
was
cannot
guess
but
have
never
felt
such
challenge
The
counter
spell
was
terrible
nearly
broke
For
instant
the
door
left
control
and
began
open
had
speak
word
Command
That
proved
too
great
strain
The
door
burst
pieces
Something
dark
cloud
was
blocking
out
all
the
light
inside
and
was
thrown
back
wards
down
the
stairs
All
the
wall
gave
way
and
the
roof
the
chamber
well
think
afraid
Balin
buried
deep
and
maybe
something
else
buried
there
too
cannot
say
But
least
the
passage
behind
was
completely
blocked
have
never
felt
spent
but
passing
And
now
what
about
you
Frodo
There
was
not
time
say
but
have
never
been
more
delighted
life
than
when
you
spoke
feared
that
was
brave
but
dead
hobbit
that
Aragorn
was
carrying
What
about
said
Frodo
alive
and
whole
think
bruised
and
pain
but
not
too
bad
THE
BRIDGE
KHAZAD
DUM
427
Well
said
Aragorn
can
only
say
that
hobbits
are
made
stuff
tough
that
have
never
met
the
like
Had
known
would
have
spoken
softer
the
Inn
Bree
That
spear
thrust
would
have
skewered
wild
boar
Well
did
not
skewer
glad
say
said
Frodo
though
feel
had
been
caught
between
hammer
and
anvil
said
more
found
breathing
painful
You
take
after
Bilbo
said
Gandalf
There
more
about
you
than
meets
the
eye
said
him
long
ago
Frodo
wondered
the
remark
meant
more
than
said
They
now
went
again
Before
long
Gimli
spoke
had
keen
eyes
the
dark
think
said
that
there
light
ahead
But
not
daylight
red
What
can
Ghash
muttered
Gandalf
wonder
that
what
they
meant
that
the
lower
levels
are
fire
Still
can
only
Soon
the
light
became
unmistakable
and
could
seen
all
was
flickering
and
glowing
the
walls
away
down
the
passage
before
them
They
could
now
see
their
way
front
the
road
sloped
down
swiftly
and
some
way
ahead
there
stood
low
archway
through
the
growing
light
came
The
air
became
very
hot
When
they
came
the
arch
Gandalf
went
through
signing
them
wait
stood
just
beyond
the
opening
they
saw
his
face
lit
red
glow
Quickly
stepped
back
There
some
new
devilry
here
said
devised
for
our
welcome
doubt
But
know
now
where
are
have
reached
the
First
Deep
the
level
immediately
below
the
Gates
This
the
Second
Hall
Old
Moria
and
the
Gates
are
near
away
beyond
the
eastern
end
the
left
not
more
than
quarter
mile
Across
the
Bridge
broad
stair
along
wide
road
through
the
First
Hall
and
out
But
come
and
look
They
peered
out
Before
them
was
another
cavernous
hall
was
loftier
and
far
longer
than
the
one
which
they
had
slept
They
were
near
its
eastern
end
westward
ran
away
428
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
into
darkness
Down
the
centre
stalked
double
line
tower
ing
pillars
They
were
carved
like
boles
mighty
trees
whose
boughs
upheld
the
roof
with
branching
tracery
stone
Their
stems
were
smooth
and
black
but
red
glow
was
darkly
mirrored
their
sides
Right
across
the
floor
close
the
feet
two
huge
pillars
great
fissure
had
opened
Out
fierce
red
light
came
and
now
and
again
flames
licked
the
brink
and
curled
about
the
bases
the
columns
Wisps
dark
smoke
wavered
the
hot
air
had
come
the
main
road
down
from
the
upper
halls
should
have
been
trapped
here
said
Gandalf
Let
hope
that
the
fire
now
lies
between
and
pursuit
Come
There
time
lose
Even
spoke
they
heard
again
the
pursuing
drum
beat
Doom
doom
doom
Away
beyond
the
shadows
the
western
end
the
hall
there
came
cries
and
horn
calls
Doom
doom
the
pillars
seemed
tremble
and
the
flames
quiver
Now
for
the
last
race
said
Gandalf
the
sun
shining
outside
may
still
escape
After
turned
left
and
sped
across
the
smooth
floor
the
hall
The
distance
was
greater
than
had
looked
they
ran
they
heard
the
beat
and
echo
many
hurrying
feet
behind
shrill
yell
went
they
had
been
seen
There
was
ring
and
clash
steel
arrow
whistled
over
Frodo
head
Boromir
laughed
They
did
not
expect
this
said
The
fire
has
cut
them
off
are
the
wrong
side
Look
ahead
called
Gandalf
The
Bridge
near
dangerous
and
narrow
Suddenly
Frodo
saw
before
him
black
chasm
the
end
the
hall
the
floor
vanished
and
fell
unknown
depth
The
outer
door
could
only
reached
slender
bridge
stone
without
kerb
rail
that
spanned
the
chasm
with
one
curving
spring
fifty
feet
was
ancient
defence
the
Dwarves
against
any
enemy
that
might
capture
the
First
Hall
and
the
outer
passages
They
could
only
pass
across
single
file
the
brink
Gandalf
halted
and
the
others
came
pack
behind
THE
BRIDGE
KHAZAD
DUM
429
Lead
the
way
Gimli
said
Pippin
and
Merry
next
Straight
and
the
stair
beyond
the
door
Arrows
fell
among
them
One
struck
Frodo
and
sprang
back
Another
pierced
Gandalf
hat
and
stuck
there
like
black
feather
Frodo
looked
behind
Beyond
the
fire
saw
swarming
black
figures
there
seemed
hundreds
ores
They
brandished
spears
and
scimitars
which
shone
red
blood
the
firelight
Doom
doom
rolled
the
drum
beats
growing
louder
and
louder
doom
doom
Legolas
turned
and
set
arrow
the
string
though
was
long
shot
for
his
small
bow
drew
but
his
hand
fell
and
the
arrow
slipped
the
ground
gave
cry
dismay
and
fear
Two
great
trolls
appeared
they
bore
great
slabs
stone
and
flung
them
down
serve
gangways
over
the
fire
But
was
not
the
trolls
that
had
filled
the
Elf
with
terror
The
ranks
the
ores
had
opened
and
they
crowded
away
they
themselves
were
afraid
Something
was
coming
behind
them
What
was
could
not
seen
was
like
great
shadow
the
middle
which
was
dark
form
man
shape
maybe
yet
greater
and
power
and
terror
seemed
and
before
came
the
edge
the
fire
and
the
light
faded
cloud
had
bent
over
Then
with
rush
leaped
across
the
fissure
The
flames
roared
greet
and
wreathed
about
and
black
smoke
swirled
the
air
Its
streaming
mane
kindled
and
blazed
behind
its
right
hand
was
blade
like
stabbing
tongue
fire
its
left
held
whip
many
thongs
wailed
Legolas
Balrog
Balrog
come
Gimli
stared
with
wide
eyes
Durin
Bane
cried
and
letting
his
axe
fall
covered
his
face
Balrog
muttered
Gandalf
Now
understand
faltered
and
leaned
heavily
his
staff
What
evil
fortune
And
already
weary
The
dark
figure
streaming
with
fire
raced
towards
them
The
ores
yelled
and
poured
over
the
stone
gangways
Then
430
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Boromir
raised
his
horn
and
blew
Loud
the
challenge
rang
and
bellowed
like
the
shout
many
throats
under
the
cavernous
roof
For
moment
the
ores
quailed
and
the
fiery
shadow
halted
Then
the
echoes
died
suddenly
flame
blown
out
dark
wind
and
the
enemy
advanced
again
Over
the
bridge
cried
Gandalf
recalling
his
strength
Fly
This
foe
beyond
any
you
must
hold
the
narrow
way
Fly
Aragorn
and
Boromir
did
not
heed
the
command
but
still
held
their
ground
side
side
behind
Gandalf
the
far
end
the
bridge
The
others
halted
just
within
the
doorway
the
hall
end
and
turned
unable
leave
their
leader
face
the
enemy
alone
The
Balrog
reached
the
bridge
Gandalf
stood
the
middle
the
span
leaning
the
staff
his
left
hand
but
his
other
hand
Glamdring
gleamed
cold
and
white
Flis
enemy
halted
again
facing
him
and
the
shadow
about
reached
out
like
two
vast
wings
raised
the
whip
and
the
thongs
whined
and
cracked
Fire
came
from
its
nostrils
But
Gandalf
stood
firm
You
cannot
pass
said
The
ores
stood
still
and
dead
silence
fell
servant
the
Secret
Fire
wielder
the
flame
Anor
You
cannot
pass
The
dark
fire
will
not
avail
you
flame
Udun
back
the
Shadow
You
cannot
pass
The
Balrog
made
answer
The
fire
seemed
die
but
the
darkness
grew
stepped
forward
slowly
the
bridge
and
suddenly
drew
itself
great
height
and
its
wings
were
spread
from
wall
wall
but
still
Gandalf
could
seen
glimmering
the
gloom
seemed
small
and
altogether
alone
grey
and
bent
like
wizened
tree
before
the
onset
storm
From
out
the
shadow
red
sword
leaped
flaming
Glamdring
glittered
white
answer
There
was
ringing
clash
and
stab
white
fire
The
Balrog
fell
back
and
its
sword
flew
molten
fragments
The
wizard
swayed
the
bridge
stepped
back
pace
and
then
again
stood
still
THE
BRIDGE
ICHAZAD
DUM
431
You
cannot
pass
said
With
bound
the
Balrog
leaped
full
upon
the
bridge
Its
whip
whirled
and
hissed
cannot
stand
alone
cried
Aragorn
suddenly
and
ran
back
along
the
bridge
Elendil
shouted
with
you
Gandalf
Gondor
cried
Boromir
and
leaped
after
him
that
moment
Gandalf
lifted
his
staff
and
crying
aloud
smote
the
bridge
before
him
The
staff
broke
asunder
and
fell
from
his
hand
blinding
sheet
white
flame
sprang
The
bridge
cracked
Right
the
Balrog
feet
broke
and
the
stone
upon
which
stood
crashed
into
the
gulf
while
the
rest
remained
poised
quivering
like
tongue
rock
thrust
out
into
emptiness
With
terrible
cry
the
Balrog
fell
forward
and
its
shadow
plunged
down
and
vanished
But
even
fell
swung
its
whip
and
the
thongs
lashed
and
curled
about
the
wizard
knees
dragging
him
the
brink
staggered
and
fell
grasped
vainly
the
stone
and
slid
into
the
abyss
Fly
you
fools
cried
and
was
gone
The
fires
went
out
and
blank
darkness
fell
The
Company
stood
rooted
with
horror
staring
into
the
pit
Even
Aragorn
and
Boromir
came
flying
back
the
rest
the
bridge
cracked
and
fell
With
cry
Aragorn
roused
them
Come
will
lead
you
now
called
must
obey
his
last
command
Follow
They
stumbled
wildly
the
great
stairs
beyond
the
door
Aragorn
leading
Boromir
the
rear
the
top
was
wide
echoing
passage
Along
this
they
fled
Frodo
heard
Sam
his
side
weeping
and
then
found
that
himself
was
weeping
ran
Doom
doom
doom
the
drum
beats
rolled
behind
mournful
now
and
slow
doom
They
ran
The
light
grew
before
them
great
shafts
pierced
the
roof
They
ran
swifter
They
passed
into
hall
bright
with
daylight
from
its
high
windows
the
east
They
fled
across
Through
its
huge
broken
doors
they
passed
432
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
and
suddenly
before
them
the
Great
Gates
opened
arch
blazing
light
There
was
guard
ores
crouching
the
shadows
behind
the
great
door
posts
towering
either
side
but
the
gates
were
shattered
and
cast
down
Aragorn
smote
the
ground
the
captain
that
stood
his
path
and
the
rest
fled
terror
his
wrath
The
Company
swept
past
them
and
took
heed
them
Out
the
Gates
they
ran
and
sprang
down
the
huge
and
age
worn
steps
the
threshold
Moria
Thus
last
they
came
beyond
hope
under
the
sky
and
felt
the
wind
their
faces
They
did
not
halt
until
they
were
out
bowshot
from
the
walls
Dimrill
Dale
lay
about
them
The
shadow
the
Misty
Mountains
lay
upon
but
eastwards
there
was
golden
light
the
land
was
but
one
hour
after
noon
The
sun
was
shining
the
clouds
were
white
and
high
They
looked
back
Dark
yawned
the
archway
the
Gates
under
the
mountain
shadow
Faint
and
far
beneath
the
earth
rolled
the
slow
drum
beats
doom
thin
black
smoke
trailed
out
Nothing
else
was
seen
the
dale
all
around
was
empty
Doom
Grief
last
wholly
overcame
them
and
they
wept
long
some
standing
and
silent
some
cast
upon
the
ground
Doom
doom
The
drum
beats
faded
Chapter
LOTHLORIEN
Alas
fear
cannot
stay
here
longer
said
Aragorn
looked
towards
the
mountains
and
held
his
sword
Fare
well
Gandalf
cried
Did
not
say
you
you
pass
the
doors
Moria
beware
Alas
that
spoke
true
What
hope
have
without
you
turned
the
Company
must
without
hope
said
least
may
yet
avenged
Let
gird
ourselves
and
weep
more
Come
have
long
road
and
much
They
rose
and
looked
about
them
Northward
the
dale
ran
into
glen
shadows
between
two
great
arms
the
mountains
above
which
three
white
peaks
were
shining
Celebdil

Mountains

the

torrent
flowed
like
white
lace
over
endless
ladder
short
falls
and
mist
foam
hung
the
air
about

Yonder
the
Dimrill
Stair
said
Aragorn
pointing
the
falls
Down
the
deep
cloven
way
that
climbs
beside
the
torrent
should
have
come
fortune
had
been
kinder
Caradhras
less
cruel
said
Gimli
There
stands
smiling
the
sun
shook
his
fist
the
furthest
the

and
turned
away
the
east
the
outflung

and
far
lands
could
descried
beyond
them
wide
and
vague
the
south
the
Misty
Mountains
receded
endlessly
far
sight
could
reach
Less
than
mile
away
and
little
below
them
for
they
still
stood
high
the
west
side
the
dale
there
lay
mere
was
long
and
oval
shaped
like
great

thrust
deep
into
the

but
its

was
beyond

shadows
under

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
sunlit
sky
Yet
its
waters
were
dark
deep
blue
like
clear
evening
sky
seen
from
lamp
lit
room
Its
face
was
still
and
unruffled
About
lay
smooth
sward
shelving
down
all
sides
its
bare
unbroken
rim
There
lies
the
Mirrormere
deep
Kheled
zaram
said
Gimli
sadly
remember
that
said
May
you
have
joy
the
sight
But
cannot
linger
there
Now
long
shall
journey
ere
have
joy
again
that
must
hasten
away
and
that
must
remain
The
Company
now
went
down
the
road
from
the
Gates
was
rough
and
broken
fading
winding
track
between
heather
and
whin
that
thrust
amid
the
cracking
stones
But
still
could
seen
that
once
long
ago
great
paved
way
had
wound
upwards
from
the
lowlands
the
Dwarf
kingdom
places
there
were
ruined
works
stone
beside
the
path
and
mounds
green
topped
with
slender
birches
fir
trees
sighing
the
wind
eastward
bend
led
them
hard
the
sward
Mirrormere
and
there
not
far
from
the
roadside
stood
single
column
broken
the
top
That
Durin
Stone
cried
Gimli
cannot
pass
without
turning
aside
for
moment
look
the
wonder
the
dale
swift
then
said
Aragorn
looking
back
towards
the
Gates
The
Sun
sinks
early
The
Ores
will
not
maybe
come
out
till
after
dusk
but
must
far
away
before
nightfall
The
Moon
almost
spent
and
will
dark
tonight
Come
with
Frodo
cried
the
dwarf
springing
from
the
road
would
not
have
you
without
seeing
Kheled
zaram
ran
down
the
long
green
slope
Frodo
followed
slowly
drawn
the
still
blue
water
spite
hurt
and
weariness
Sam
came
behind
Beside
the
standing
stone
Gimli
halted
and
looked
was
cracked
and
weather
worn
and
the
faint
runes
upon
its
side
could
not
read
This
pillar
marks
the
spot
where
Durin
first
looked
the
Mirrormere
said
the
dwarf
Let
look
ourselves
once
ere
They
stooped
over
the
dark
water
first
they
could
see
LOTHLORIEN
435
nothing
Then
slowly
they
saw
the
forms
the
encircling
mountains
mirrored
profound
blue
and
the
peaks
were
like
plumes
white
flame
above
them
beyond
there
was
space
sky
There
like
jewels
sunk
the
deep
shone
glinting
stars
though
sunlight
was
the
sky
above
their
own
stooping
forms
shadow
could
seen
Kheled

fair
and
wonderful
said
Gimli
There
lies
the
Crown
Durin
till
wakes
Farewell
bowed
and
turned
away
and
hastened
back
the
greensward
the
road
again
What
did
you
see
said
Pippin
Sam
but
Sam
was
too
deep
thought
answer
The
road
now
turned
south
and
went
quickly
downwards
running
out
from
between
the
arms
the
dale
Some
way
below
the
mere
they
came
deep
well
water
clear
crystal
from
which
freshet
fell
over
stone
lip
and
ran
glistening
and
gurgling
down
steep
rocky
channel
Here
the
spring
from
which
the
Silverlode
rises
said
Gimli
not
drink
icy
cold
Soon
becomes
swift
river
and
gathers
water
from
many
other
mountain
streams
said
Aragorn
Our
road
leads
beside
for
many
miles
For
shall
take
you
the
road
that
Gandalf
chose
and
first
hope
come
the
woods
where
the
Silverlode
flows
into
the
Great
River
out
yonder
They
looked
pointed
and
before
them
they
could
see
the
stream
leaping
down
the
trough
the
valley
and
then
running
and
away
into
the
lower
lands
until
was
lost
golden
haze
There
lie
the
woods
Lothlorien
said
Legolas
That
the
fairest
all
the
dwellings
people
There
are
trees
like
the
trees
that
land
For
the
autumn
their
leaves
fall
not
but
turn
gold
Not
till
the
spring
comes
and
the
new
green
opens
they
fall
and
then
the
boughs
are
laden
with
yellow
flowers
and
the
floor
the
wood
golden
and
golden
the

and
its
pillars
are

THE

THE
RING
say
heart
would
glad
were
beneath
the
eaves
that
wood
and
were
springtime
heart
will
glad
even
the
winter
said
Aragorn
But
lies
many
miles
away
Let
hasten
For
some
time
Frodo
and
Sam
managed
keep
with
the
others
but
Aragorn
was
leading
them
great
pace
and
after
while
they
lagged
behind
They
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
early
morning
Sam
cut
was
burning
like
fire
and
his
head
felt
light
spite
the
shining
sun
the
wind
seemed
chill
after
the
warm
darkness
Moria
shivered
Frodo
felt
every
step
more
painful
and
gasped
for
breath
last
Legolas
turned
and
seeing
them
now
far
behind
spoke
Aragorn
The
others
halted
and
Aragorn
ran
back
calling
Boromir
come
with
him
sorry
Frodo
cried
full
concern
much
has
happened
this
day
and
have
such
need
haste
that
have
forgotten
that
you
were
hurt
and
Sam
too
You
should
have
spoken
have
done
nothing
ease
you
ought
though
all
the
ores
Moria
were
after
Come
now
little
further
there
place
where
can
rest
for
little
There
will
what
can
for
you
Come
Boromir
will
carry
them
Soon
afterwards
they
came
upon
another
stream
that
ran
down
from
the
west
and
joined
its
bubbling
water
with
the
hurrying
Silverlode
Together
they
plunged
over
fall
green
hued
stone
and
foamed
down
into
dell
About
stood
fir
trees
short
and
bent
and
its
sides
were
steep
and
clothed
with
harts
tongue
and
shrubs
whortle
berry
the
bottom
there
was
level
space
through
which
the
stream
flowed
noisily
over
shining
pebbles
Here
they
rested
was
now
nearly
three
hours
after
noon
and
they
had
come
only
few
miles
from
the
Gates
Already
the
sun
was
westering
While
Gimli
and
the
two
younger
hobbits
kindled
fire
brush
and
fir
wood
and
drew
water
Aragorn
tended
Sam
and
Frodo
Sam
wound
was
not
deep
but
looked
ugly
LOTHLORIEN
437
and
Aragorn
face
was
grave
examined
After
moment
looked
with
relief
Good
luck
Sam
said
Many
have
received
worse
than
this
payment
for
the
slaying
their
first
ore
The
cut
not
poisoned
the
wounds
ore
blades
too
often
are
should
heal
well
when
have
tended
Bathe
when
Gimli
has
heated
water
opened
his
pouch
and
drew
out
some
withered
leaves
They
are
dry
and
some
their
virtue
has
gone
said
but
here
have
still
some
the
leaves
athelas
that
gathered
near
Weathertop
Crush
one
the
water
and
wash
the
wound
clean
and
will
bind
Now
your
turn
Frodo
all
right
said
Frodo
reluctant
have
his
garments
touched
All
needed
was
some
food
and
little
rest
said
Aragorn
must
have
look
and
see
what
the
hammer
and
the
anvil
have
done
you
still
marvel
that
you
are
alive
all
Gently
stripped
off
Frodo
old
jacket
and
worn
tunic
and
gave
gasp
wonder
Then
laughed
The
silver
corslet
shimmered
before
his
eyes
like
the
light
upon
rippling
sea
Carefully
took
off
and
held
and
the
gems
glittered
like
stars
and
the
sound
the
shaken
rings
was
like
the
tinkle
rain
pool
Look
friends
called
Here
pretty
hobbit
skin
wrap
elven
princeling
were
known
that
hobbits
had
such
hides
all
the
hunters
Middle
earth
would
riding
the
Shire
And
all
the
arrows
all
the
hunters
the
world
would
vain
said
Gimli
gazing
the
mail
wonder
mithril
coat
Mithril
have
never
seen
heard
tell
one
fair
this
the
coat
that
Gandalf
spoke
Then
undervalued
But
was
well
given
have
often
wondered
what
you
and
Bilbo
were
doing
close
his
little
room
said
Merry
Bless
the
old
hobbit
love
him
more
than
ever

438
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
There
was
dark
and
blackened
bruise
Frodo
right
side
and
breast
Under
the
mail
there
was
shirt
soft
leather
but
one
point
the
rings
had
been
driven
through
into
the
flesh
Frodo
left
side
also
was
scored
and
bruised
where
had
been
hurled
against
the
wall
While
the
others
set
the
food
ready
Aragorn
bathed
the
hurts
with
water
which
athelas
was
steeped
The
pungent
fragrance
filled
the
dell
and
all
those
who
stooped
over
the
steaming
water
felt
refreshed
and
strengthened
Soon
Frodo
felt
the
pain
leave
him
and
his
breath
grew
easy
though
was
stiff
and
sore
the
touch
for
many
days
Aragorn
bound
some
soft
pads
cloth
his
side
The
mail
marvellously
light
said
Put
again
you
can
bear
heart
glad
know
that
you
have
such
coat
not
lay
aside
even
sleep
unless
fortune
brings
you
where
you
are
safe
for
while
and
that
will
seldom
chance
while
your
quest
lasts
When
they
had
eaten
the
Company
got
ready
They
put
out
the
fire
and
hid
all
traces
Then
climbing
out
the
dell
they
took
the
road
again
They
had
not
gone
far
before
the
sun
sank
behind
the
westward
heights
and
great
shadows
crept
down
the
mountain
sides
Dusk
veiled
their
feet
and
mist
rose
the
hollows
Away
the
east
the
evening
light
lay
pale
upon
the
dim
lands
distant
plain
and
wood
Sam
and
Frodo
now
feeling
eased
and
greatly
refreshed
were
able
fair
pace
and
with
only
one
brief
halt
Aragorn
led
the
Company
for
nearly
three
more
hours
was
dark
Deep
night
had
fallen
There
were
many
clear
stars
but
the
fast
waning
moon
would
not
seen
till
late
Gimli
and
Frodo
were
the
rear
walking
softly
and
not
speaking
listening
for
any
sound
upon
the
road
behind
length
Gimli
broke
the
silence
Not
sound
but
the
wind
said
There
are
goblins
near
ears
are
made
wood
hoped
that
the
Ores
will
content
with
driving
from
Moria
And
maybe
LOTHLORIEN
439
that
was
all
their
purpose
and
they
had
nothing
else
with
with
the
Ring
Though
Ores
will
often
pursue
foes
for
many
leagues
into
the
plain
they
have
fallen
captain
avenge
Frodo
did
not
answer
looked
Sting
and
the
blade
was
dull
Yet
had
heard
something
thought
had
soon
the
shadows
had
fallen
about
them
and
the
road
behind
was
dim
had
heard
again
the
quick
patter
feet
Even
now
heard
turned
swiftly
There
were
two
tiny
gleams
light
behind
for
moment
thought
saw
them
but
once
they
slipped
aside
and
vanished
What
said
the
dwarf
don
know
answered
Frodo
thought
heard
feet
and
thought
saw
light
like
eyes
have
thought
often
since
first
entered
Moria
Gimli
halted
and
stooped
the
ground
hear
nothing
but
the
night
speech
plant
and
stone
said
Come
Let
hurry
The
others
are
out
sight
The
night
wind
blew
chill
the
valley
meet
them
Before
them
wide
grey
shadow
loomed
and
they
heard
endless
rustle
leaves
like
poplars
the
breeze
Lothlorien
cried
Legolas
Lothlorien
have
come
the
eaves
the
Golden
Wood
Alas
that
winter
Under
the
night
the
trees
stood
tall
before
them
arched
over
the
road
and
stream
that
ran
suddenly
beneath
their
spreading
boughs
the
dim
light
the
stars
their
stems
were
grey
and
their
quivering
leaves
hint
fallow
gold
Lothlorien
said
Aragorn
Glad
hear
again
the
wind
the
trees
are
still
little
more
than
five
leagues
from
the
Gates
but
can
further
Here
let
hope
that
the
virtue
the
Elves
will
keep
tonight
from
the
peril
that
comes
behind
Elves
indeed
still
dwell
here
the
darkening
world
said
Gimli
long
since
any
own
folic
journeyed
hither
back
the
land
whence
wandered
ages
long
ago

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
said
Legolas
but
hear
that
Lorien
not
yet
deserted
for
there
secret
power
here
that
holds
evil
from
the
land
Nevertheless
its
folk
are
seldom
seen
and
maybe
they
dwell
now
deep
the
woods
and
far
from
the
northern
border
Indeed
deep
the
wood
they
dwell
said
Aragorn
and
sighed
some
memory
stirred
him
must
fend
for
ourselves
tonight
will
forward
short
way
until
the
trees
are
all
about
and
then
will
turn
aside
from
the
path
and
seek
place
rest
stepped
forward
but
Boromir
stood
irresolute
and
did
not
follow
there
other
way
said
What
other
fairer
way
would
you
desire
said
Aragorn
plain
road
though
led
through
hedge
swords
said
Boromir
strange
paths
has
this
Company
been
led
and
far
evil
fortune
Against
will
passed
under
the
shades
Moria
our
loss
And
now
must
enter
the
Golden
Wood
you
say
But
that
perilous
land
have
heard
Gondor
and
said
that
few
come
out
who
once
and
that
few
none
have
escaped
unscathed
Say
not
unscathed
but
you
say
unchanged
then
maybe
you
will
speak
the
truth
said
Aragorn
But
lore
wanes
Gondor
Boromir
the
city
those
who
once
were
wise
they
now
speak
evil
Lothlorien
Believe
what
you
will
there
other
way
for
unless
you
would
back
Moria
gate
scale
the
pathless
mountains
swim
the
Great
River
all
alone
Then
lead
said
Boromir
But
perilous
Perilous
indeed
said
Aragorn
fair
and
perilous
but
only
evil
need
fear
those
who
bring
some
evil
with
them
Follow
They
had
gone
little
more
than
mile
into
the
forest
when
they
came
upon
another
stream
flowing
down
swiftly
from
the
tree
clad
slopes
that
climbed
back
westward
towards
the
mountains
They
heard
splashing
over
fall
away
among
the
shadows
their
right
Its
dark
hurrying
waters
ran
across
LOTHLORIEN
the
path
before
them
and
joined
the
Silverlode
swirl
dim
pools
among
the
roots
trees
Here
Nimrodel
said
Legolas
this
stream
the
Silvan
Elves
made
many
songs
long
ago
and
still
sing
them
the
North
remembering
the
rainbow
its
falls
and
the
golden
flowers
that
floated
its
foam
All
dark
now
and
the
Bridge
Nimrodel
broken
down
will
bathe
feet
for
said
that
the
water
healing
the
weary
went
forward
and
climbed
down
the
deep
cloven
bank
and
stepped
into
the
stream
Follow
cried
The
water
not
deep
Let
wade
across
the
further
bank
can
rest
and
the
sound
the
falling
water
may
bring
sleep
and
forgetfulness
grief
One
one
they
climbed
down
and
followed
Legolas
For
moment
Frodo
stood
near
the
brink
and
let
the
water
flow
over
his
tired
feet
was
cold
but
its
touch
was
clean
and
went
and
mounted
his
knees
felt
that
the
stain
travel
and
all
weariness
was
washed
from
his
limbs
When
all
the
Company
had
crossed
they
sat
and
rested
and
ate
little
food
and
Legolas
told
them
tales
Lothlorien
that
the
Elves
Mirkwood
still
kept
their
hearts
sun

River
before

length
silence
fell
and
they
heard
the

the

running
sweetly
the

Almost
Frodo
fancied
that
could
hear
voice
singing
mingled
with
the
sound
the

you
hear
the
voice
Nimrodel
asked
Legolas
will
sing

bore
the

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Elven
maid
there
was
old
shining
star
day
Her
mantle
white
was
hemmed
with
gold
Her
shoes
silver
grey
star
was
bound
upon
her
brows
light
was
her
hair
sun
upon
the
golden
boughs
Lorien
the
fair
Her
hair
was
long
her
limbs
were
white
And
fair
she
was
and
free
And
the
wind
she
went
light
leaf
linden
tree
Beside
the
falls
Nimrodel
water
clear
and
cool
Her
voice
falling
silver
fell
Into
the
shining
pool
Where
now
she
wanders
none
can
tell
sunlight
shade
For
lost
yore
was
Nimrodel
And
the
mountains
strayed
The
elven
ship

grey
Beneath
the
mountain

Awaited
her
for
many
day
Beside
the
roaring

Northern

Arose

And
drove
the

from
elven

Across
the

LOTHLORIEN
443
When
dawn
came
dim
the
land
was
lost
The
mountains
sinking
grey
Beyond
the
heaving
waves
that
tossed
Their
plumes
blinding
spray
Amroth
beheld
the
fading
shore
Now
low
beyond
the
swell
And
cursed
the
faithless

that
bore
Him

From

they
saw
him
leap

from

And
dive
into
the

deep
mew
upon
the
wing
The
wind
was
his
flowing
hair
The
foam
about
him
shone
Afar
they
saw
him
strong
and
fair
riding
like
swan
But
from
the
West
has
come
word
And
the
Hither
Shore
tidings
Elven
folk
have
heard
Amroth
evermore
The
voice
Legolas
faltered
and
the
song
ceased

not

That
but
part
for

forgotten

long
and
sad
for
tells
how
sorrow
came
upon
Lothlorien
Lorien
the
Blossom
when
the
Dwarves
awakened
evil
the

But
the
Dwarves
did
not

Then

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
many
the
Elves
Nimrodel
kindred
left
their
dwellings
and
departed
and
she
was
lost
far
the
South
the
passes
the
White
Mountains
and
she
came
not
the
ship
where
Amroth
her
lover
waited
for
her
But
the
spring
when
the
wind
the
new
leaves
the
echo
her
voice
may
still
heard
the
falls
that
bear
her
name
And
when
the
wind
the
South
the
voice
Amroth
comes
from
the
sea
for
Nimrodel
flows
into
Silverlode
that
Elves
call
Celebrant
and
Celebrant
into
Anduin
the
Great
and
Anduin
flows
into
the
Bay
Belfalas
whence
the
Elves
Lorien
set
sail
But
neither
Nimrodel
nor
Amroth
came
ever
back
told
that
she
had
house
built
the
branches
tree
that
grew
near
the
falls
for
that
was
the
custom
the
Elves
Lorien
dwell
the
trees
and
maybe
still
Therefore
they
were
called
the
Galadhrim
the
Tree
people
Deep
their
forest
the
trees
are
very
great
The
people
the
woods
did
not
delve
the
ground
like
Dwarves
nor
build
strong
places
stone
before
the
Shadow
came
And
even
these
latter
days
dwelling
the
trees
might
thought
safer
than
sitting
the
ground
said
Gimli
looked
across
the
stream
the
road
that
led
back
Dimrill
Dale
and
then
into
the
roof
dark
boughs
above
Your
words
bring
good
counsel
Gimli
said
Aragorn
cannot
build
house
but
tonight
will
the
Galadhrim
and
seek
refuge
the
tree
tops
can
have
sat
here
beside
the
road
already
longer
than
was
wise
The
Company
now
turned
aside
from
the
path
and
went
into
the
shadow
the
deeper
woods
westward
along
the
mountain
stream
away
from
Silverlode
Not
far
from
the
falls
Nimrodel
they
found
cluster
trees
some
which
overhung
the
stream
Their
great
grey
trunks
were
mighty
girth
but
their
height
could
not
guessed

said
Legolas
home
among

though
these
trees
are

strange

Legolas
that

But
you
must

from
Ores
sprang
lightly
from
the
ground
and
caught
branch
that
grew
from
the
trunk
high
above
his
head
But
even
swung
there
for
moment
voice
spoke
suddenly
from
the
tree
shadows
above
him
Daro
said
commanding
tone
and
Legolas
dropped
back
earth
surprise
and
fear
shrank
against
the
bole
the
tree
Stand
still
whispered
the
others
not
move
speak
There
was
sound
soft
laughter
over
their
heads
and
then
another
clear
voice
spoke
elven
tongue
Frodo
could
understand
little
what
was
said
for
the
speech
that
the
Silvan
folk
east
the
mountains
used
among
themselves
was
unlike
that
the
West
Legolas
looked
and
answered
the
same
language
Who
are
they
and
what
they
say
asked
Merry
They
Elves
said
Sam
Can
you
hear
their
voices
Yes
they
are
Elves
said
Legolas
and
they
say
that
you
breathe
loud
that
they
could
shoot
you
the
dark
Sam
hastily
put
his
hand
over
his
mouth
But
they
say
also
that
you
need
have
fear
They
have
been
aware
for
long
while
They
heard
voice
across
the
Nimrodel
and
knew
that
was
one
their
Northern
kindred
and
therefore
they
did
not
hinder
our
crossing
and
afterwards
they
heard
song
Now
they
bid
climb
with
Frodo
for
they
seem
have
had
some
tidings
him
and
our
journey
The
others
they
ask
wait
little
and
keep
watch
the
foot
the
tree
until
they
have
decided
what
done

THE

THE

Out

ladder
was
let
down
was
made
rope
silver
grey
and
glimmering
the
dark
and
though
looked
slender
proved
strong
enough
bear
many
men
Legolas
ran
lightly
and
Frodo
followed
slowly
behind
came
Sam
trying
not
breathe
loudly
The
branches
the
mallorn
tree
grew
out
nearly
straight
from
the
trunk
and
then
swept
upward
but
near
the
top
the
main
stem
divided
into
crown
many
boughs
and
among
these
they
found
that
there
had
been
built
wooden
platform
jiet
such
things
were
called
those
days
the
Elves
called
talan
was
reached
round
hole
the
centre
through
which
the
ladder
passed
When
Frodo
came
last
the
flet
found
Legolas
seated
with
three
other
Elves
They
were
clad
shadowy
grey
and
could
not
seen
among
the
tree
stems
unless
they
moved
suddenly
They
stood
and
one
them
uncovered
small
lamp
that
gave
out
slender
silver
beam
held
looking
Frodo
face
and
Sam
Then
shut
off
the
light
again
and
spoke
words
welcome
his
elven

Frodo
spoke
haltingly

But
there

You

And

Frodo
Elrond

The

together
soft

and
questioned
Legolas
their

Very

Haldir

Aragorn

But
now

Your

and
soon
afterwards
Merry

They

The

accepted
this

very
gladly
Then
they
wrapped
themselves
warmly
not
only
the
fur

the
Elves
but
their

well
and
tried
sleep
But
weary
they
were
only
Sam
found
that
easy
Hobbits
not
like

and
not

even
when
they

The

Frodo
lay
for
some
time
awake
and
looked
the
stars
glinting
through
the
pale
roof
quivering
leaves
Sam
was
snoring
his
side
long
before
himself
closed
his
eyes
could
dimly
see
the
grey
forms
two
elves
sitting
motionless
with
their
arms
about
their
knees
speaking
whispers
The
other
had
gone
down
take
his
watch
one
the

lulled
the

the

and
the
sweet

the

below
Frodo
fell
asleep
with
the
song
Legolas
running
his

Late
the
night
woke
The

were
asleep
The

were
gone
The

Moon
was

dimly
among

The

was
still
little

off
heard
harsh

and
the

There
was

head
appeared
suddenly
through
the
hole
the
flet
Frodo
sat
alarm
and
saw
that
was
grey
hooded
Elf
looked
towards
the
hobbits
What
said
Frodo
Yrch
said
the
Elf
hissing
whisper
and
cast
the
flet
the
rope
ladder
rolled
Ores
said
Frodo
What
are
they
doing
But
the
Elf
had
gone
There
were
more
sounds
Even
the
leaves
were
silent
and
the
very
falls
seemed
hushed
Frodo
sat
and
shiv
ered
his
wraps
was
thankful
that
they
had
not
been
caught
the
ground
but
felt
that
the
trees
offered
little
protection
except
concealment
Ores
were
keen
hounds
scent
was
said
but
they
could
also
climb
drew
out
Sting
flashed
and
glittered
like
blue
flame
and
then
slowly
faded
again
and
grew
dull
spite
the
fading
his
sword
the
feeling
immediate
danger
did
not
leave
Frodo
rather
grew
stronger
got
and
crawled
the
opening
and
peered
down
was
almost
certain
that
could
hear
stealthy
movements
the
tree
foot
far
below
Not
Elves
for
the
woodland
folk
were
altogether
noiseless
their
movements
Then
heard
faintly
sound
like
sniffing
and
something
seemed
scrabbling
the
bark
the
tree
trunk
stared
down
into
the
dark
holding
his
breath
Something
was
now
climbing
slowly
and
its
breath
came
like
soft
hissing
through
closed
teeth
Then
coming
close
the
stem
Frodo
saw
two
pale
eyes
They
stopped
and
gazed
upward
unwinking
Suddenly
they
turned
away
and
shadowy
figure
slipped
round
the
trunk
the
tree
and
vanished
Immediately
afterwards
Haldir
came
climbing
swiftly
through
the
branches
There
was
something
this
tree
that
have
never
seen
before
said
was
not

the

They
crossed
the
Nimrodel
curse
their
foul

its
clean

and
went
down
the
old
road
beside
the
river
They
seemed
pick
some
scent
and
they
searched
the
ground
for
while
near
the
place
where
you
halted
The

could
not

went

and

into

But
you
must
take
the
road
south
soon
fully
light
Day
came
pale
from
the
East
the
light
grew
filtered
through
the
yellow
leaves
the
mallorn
and
seemed
the
hobbits
that
the
early
sun
cool
summer
morning
was
shining
Pale
blue
sky
peeped
among
the
moving
branches
Looking
through
opening
the
south
side
the
flet
Frodo
saw
all
the
valley
the
Silverlode
lying
like
sea
fallow
gold
tossing
gently
the
breeze
The
morning
was
still
young
and
cold
when
the
Company
set
out
again
guided
now
Haldir
and
his
brother
Rumil
Farewell
sweet
Nimrodel
cried
Legolas
Frodo
looked
back
and
caught
gleam
white
foam
among
the
grey
tree
stems
Farewell
said
seemed
him
that
would
never
hear
again
running
water
beautiful
for
ever
blending
its
innumerable
notes
endless
changeful
music
They
went
back
the
path
that
still
went
along
the
west
side
the
Silverlode
and
for
some
way
they
followed
southward
There
were
the
prints
orc
feet
the
earth
But
soon
Haldir
turned
aside
into
the
trees
and
halted
the
bank
the
river
under
their
shadows
There
one
people
yonder
across
the

not

Haldir

caught

Indeed
nothing
the

clearly

than
the

that
divides
all
those
who

Yet
little

The

The

there

but
still
there

and
though

Some

Yet
not

the

filed
slowly
along
the

the

Haldir
while
the

walked

They

the

and

and

Being

Frodo
found
his

the

had
come
upon

and

ancient

the

feared

distrusted
the

were
howling
the

lay
All
that
day
the
Company
marched
until
they
felt
the
cool
evening
come
and
heard
the
early
night
wind
whispering
among
many
leaves
Then
they
rested
and
slept
without
fear
upon
the
ground
for
their
guides
would
not
permit
them
unbind
their
eyes
and
they
could
not
climb
the
morning
they
went
again
walking
without
haste
noon
they
halted
and
Frodo
was
aware
that
they
had
passed
out
under
the
shining
Sun
Suddenly
heard
the
sound
many
voices
all
around
him
marching
host
Elves
had
come
silently
they
were
hastening
towards
the
northern
borders
guard
against
any
attack
from
Moria
and
they
brought
news
some
which
Haldir
reported
The
marauding
ores
had
been
waylaid
and
almost
all
destroyed
the
remnant
had
fled
westward
towards
the
mountains
and
were
being
pursued
strange
creature
also
had
been
seen
running
with
bent
back
and
with
hands
near
the
ground
like
beast
and
yet
not
beast
shape
had
eluded
capture
and
they
had
not
shot
not
knowing
whether
was
good
ill
and
had
vanished
down
the
Silverlode
southward
Also
said
Haldir
they
bring
message
from
the
Lord
and
Lady
the
Galadhrim
You

even
the

Gimli
seems
that
the

knows
who
and
what
each

your

New
messages
have
come
from
Rivendell
perhaps
removed
the
bandage

from

Your

said
bowing
low

Look

When

his
breath
They
were
standing

Upon

High
amid

stood
the

all
there
gleamed
white

the
feet
the
trees
and
all
about
the
green
hillsides
the
grass
was
studded
with
small
golden
flowers
shaped
like
stars
Among
them
nodding
slender
stalks
were
other
flowers
white
and
palest
green
they
glimmered

amid
the
rich
hue
the
grass
Over
all
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
sun
afternoon
glowed
upon
the
hill
and
cast
long
green
shadows
beneath
the
trees
Behold
You

Cerin

said
Haldir
For
this
the
heart
the
ancient
realm
was
long
ago
and
here
the

where

his

house
was

Here
ever

the

the

Here

The

cast
themselves
down
upon

Frodo

that

Haldir
looked
them
and
seemed
indeed
take
the

both
thought
and
word
smiled
You
feel
the
power
the
Lady
the
Galadhrim
said
Would
please
you
climb
with
Cerin

They
followed
him
stepped
lightly
the
grass
clad
slopes
Though
walked
and
breathed
and
about
him
living
leaves
and
flowers
were
stirred
the
same
cool
wind
fanned
his
face
Frodo
felt
that
was
timeless
land
that
did
not
fade
change
fall
into
forgetfulness
When
had
gone
and
passed
again
into
the
outer

still
Frodo
the
wanderer
from

would
walk
there
upon

They
entered

Frodo
stood

off

upon

that
had
long

been
washed
away
and
sea
birds
crying

Haldir
took
his

saw

down

Anduin
the

lifted
his

across

all

Beyond
the

the

appeared
flat

empty
formless

vague
until
far
away
rose
again
like

The

THE
MIRROR
GALADRIEL
The
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
mountains
and
the
shadows
were
deepening
the
woods
when
they
went
again
Their
paths
now
went
into
thickets
where
the
dusk
had
already
gathered
Night
came
beneath
the
trees
they
walked
and
the
Elves
uncovered
their
silver
lamps
Suddenly
they
came
out
into
the
open
again
and
found
themselves
under
pale
evening
sky
pricked
few
early
stars
There
was
wide
treeless
space
before
them
running
great
circle
and
bending
away
either
hand
Beyond
was
deep
fosse
lost
soft
shadow
but
the
grass
upon
its
brink
was
green
glowed
still
memory
the
sun
that
had
gone
Upon
the
further
side
there
rose
great
height
green
wall
encircling
green
hill
thronged
with
mallorn
trees
taller
than
any
they
had
yet
seen
all
the
land
Their
height
could
not
guessed
but
they
stood
the
twilight
like
living
towers
their
many
tiered
branches
and
amid
their
ever
moving
leaves
countless
lights
were
gleaming
green
and
gold
and
silver
Haldir
turned
towards
the
Company

Along

with

the

the

set
between

the

Haldir

The

the

but
there
were

about

the

Far
away
the

they
could
hear
the
sound
singing
falling
from

like
soft
rain
upon

They
went
along
many
paths
and
climbed
many
stairs
until
they
came
the

and
saw
before
them
amid
wide
lawn

swung
from

and
fell
into
basin
silver
from
which
white
stream
spilled
Upon
the

side
the
lawn
there
stood
the
mightiest

its
great

bole
gleamed
like
grey

and
towered
until
its

Beside

three

They

the

approached

Frodo
saw
that
they
were
tall

and
from

hung
long
white
cloaks

been

long

from

And
the

hearing
the

given
his

looked
and
met
her

and
seemed
him
that
looked
suddenly
into

came
into

who

burden
Your

known
said
Galadriel
looking
Frodo
But
will
not
here
speak
more
openly
Yet
not
vain
will
prove
maybe
that
you
came
this
land
seeking
aid
Gandalf
himself
plainly
purposed
For
the
Lord
the
Galadhrim
accounted
the
wisest
the
Elves
Middle

and
giver

beyond

power
kings
has
dwelt
the

since
the

and
have
dwelt
with
him
years
uncounted
for
ere
the

Nargothrond
Gondolin
passed
over
the
mountains
and
together
through
ages
the
world
have
fought
the
long
defeat
was
who
first
summoned
the
White
Council
And
designs
had
not
gone
amiss
would
have
been
governed
Gandalf
the
Grey
and
then
mayhap
things
would
have
gone
otherwise
But
even
now
there
hope
left
will
not
give
you
counsel
saying
this
that
For
not
doing
contriving
nor
choosing
between
this
course
and
another
can
avail
but
only
knowing
what
was
and
and
part
also
what
shall
But
this
will
say
you
your
Quest
stands
upon
the
edge
knife
Stray
but
little
and
will
fail
the
ruin
all
Yet
hope
remains
while
all
the

true
And
with
that
word
she
held
them
with
her
eyes
and
silence
looked
searchingly
each
them
turn
None
save
Legolas
and
Aragorn
could
long
endure
her
glance
Sam
quickly
blushed
and
hung
his

length
the

Galadriel
released
them
from
her
eyes
and
she
smiled
not
let
your
hearts
troubled
she
said
Tonight
you
shall
sleep
peace
Then
they
sighed
and
felt
THE

suddenly
weary
those
who
have
been
questioned
long
and
deeply
though
words
had
been
spoken
openly
now
said
Celeborn
You
are
worn
with
sorrow
and
much
toil
Even
your
Quest
did
not
concern
closely
you
should
have
refuge
this
City
until
you
were
healed
and
refreshed
Now
you
shall
rest
and
will
not
speak
your
further
road
for
while
That
night
the
Company
slept
upon
the
ground
much
the
satisfaction
the
hobbits
The
Elves
spread
for
them
pavilion
among
the
trees
near
the
fountain
and
they
laid
soft
couches
then
speaking
words
peace
with
fair
Elvish
voices
they
left
them
For
little
while
the
travellers
talked
their
night
before
the
tree
tops
and
their
day
journey
and
the

for
they
had
not
yet
the

further
back
What

lamely
All
them
seemed
had
fared
alike
each
had
felt
that
was
offered
choice
between
shadow
full
fear
that
lay
ahead
and
something
that
greatly
desired
clear
before
his
mind
lay
and
get
had
only
turn
aside
from
the
road
and
leave
the

and
the

against

others
And
seemed
too
said
Gimli
that
choice
would
remain
secret
and
known
only
myself
466
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
seemed
exceedingly
strange
said
Boromir
Maybe
was
only
test
and
she
thought
read
our
thoughts
for
her
own
good
purpose
but
almost
should
have
said
that
she
was
tempting
and
offering
what
she
pretended
have
the
power
give
need
not
said
that
refused
listen
The
Men
Minas
Tirith
are
true
their
word
But
what
thought
that
the
Lady
had
offered
him
Boromir
did
not
tell
And
for
Frodo
would
not
speak
though
Boromir
pressed
him
with
questions
She
held
you
long
her
gaze
Ring
bearer
said
Yes
said
Frodo
but
whatever
came
into
mind
then
will
keep
there
Well
have
care
said
Boromir
not
feel
too
sure
this
Elvish
Lady
and
her
purposes
Speak
evil
the
Lady
Galadriel
said
Aragorn
sternly
know
not
what
you
say
There
her
and
this
land
evil
unless
man
bring
hither
himself
Then
let
him
beware
But
tonight
shall
sleep
without
fear
for
the
first
time
since
left
Rivendell
And
may
sleep
deep
and
forget
for
while
grief
weary
body
and
heart
cast
himself
down
upon
his
couch
and
fell
once
into
long
sleep
The
others
soon
did
the
same
and
sound
dream
disturbed
their
slumber
When
they
woke
they
found
that
the
light
day
was
broad
upon
the
lawn
before
the
pavilion
and
the
fountain
rose
and
fell
glittering
the
sun
They
remained
some
days
Lothlorien
far
they
could
tell
remember
All
the
while
that
they
dwelt
there
the
sun
shone
clear
save
for
gentle
rain
that
fell
times
and
passed
away
leaving
all
things
fresh
and
clean
The
air
was
cool
and
soft
were
early
spring
yet
they
felt
about
them
the
deep
and
thoughtful
quiet
winter
seemed
them
that
they
did
little
but
eat
and
drink
and
rest
and
walk
among
the
trees
and
was
enough
They
had
not
seen
the
Lord

Lady
again
and

with
the

Haldir
had
bidden
them
fare
well
and
gone
back
again
the
fences
the

where
great
watch
was
now
kept
since
the
tidings
Moria
that
the
Company
had
brought
Legolas
was
away
much
among
the
Galadhrim
and
after
the
first
night
did
not
sleep
with
the
other
companions
though
returned
eat
and
talk
with
them
Often
took
Gimli
with
him
when
went
abroad
the
land
and
the
others
wondered
this
change
Now
the
companions
sat
walked
together
they
spoke
Gandalf
and
all
that
each
had
known
and
seen
him
came
clear
before
their
minds
they
were
healed
hurt
and
weariness
body
the
grief
their
loss
grew
more
keen
Often
they
heard
nearby
Elvish
voices
singing
and
knew
that
they
were
making
songs
lamentation
for
his
fall
for
they
caught
his
name
among
the
sweet
sad
words
that
they
could
not
understand
Mithrandir
Mithrandir

him
But
Legolas

pany
would
not
interpret
the
songs
for
them
saying
that
had
not
the
skill
and
that
for
him
the
grief
was
still
too
near
matter
for
tears
and
not
yet
for
song
was
Frodo
who
first
put
something
his
sorrow
into
halting
words
was
seldom
moved
make
song

even
Rivendell
had
listened
and
had
not
sung
himself
though
his
memory
was
stored
with
many
things
that

had
made
before

But
now
sat
beside

and
heard

Frodo
But
that
the

can
yet
Well
Frodo
you
have
another
hope
you
say
word
about
his
fireworks
said
Sam
Something
like
this
The
finest

ever
seen
they
burst
stars
blue
and
green
after
thunder
golden
showers
came
falling
like

long

you
Sam
perhaps
Bilbo
But
well
can
talk
any
more
can
bear
think
bringing
the
news
him
One
evening
Frodo
and
Sam
were
walking
together
the
cool
twilight
Both
them
felt
restless
again
Frodo
suddenly
the
shadow
parting
had
fallen
knew
somehow
that
the
time
was
very
near
when
must
leave
Lothlorien
What
you
think
Elves
now
Sam
said
asked
you
the
same
question
once
before
seems
very
long
while
ago
but
you
have
seen
more
them
since
then
have
indeed
said
Sam
And
reckon
there
Elves
and
Elves
They
all
Elvish
enough
but
they
not
all
the
same
Now
these
folk
aren
wanderers
homeless
and
seem
bit
nearer
the
likes
they
seem
belong
here
more
even
than
Etobbits
the
Shire
Whether
they
made
the
land
the
land
made
them
hard
say
you
take
meaning
wonderfully
quiet
here
Nothing
seems
going
and
nobody
seems
want
there
any
magic
about
right
down
deep
where
can
lay
hands
manner
speaking
You
can
see
and
feel
everywhere
said
Frodo
Well
said
Sam
you
can
see
nobody
working
fireworks
like
poor
old
Gandalf
used
show
wonder
don
see
nothing
the
Lord
and
Lady
all
these
days
fancy
now
that
she
could
some
wonderful
things
she
had
mind
dearly
love
see
some
Elf
magic
Frodo
wouldn
said
Frodo
content
And
don
miss
Gandalf
fireworks
but
his
bushy
eyebrows
and
his
quick
temper
and
his
voice
You
right
said
Sam
And
don
think
finding
fault
often
wanted
see
bit
magic
like
what
tells
old
tales
but
never
heard
better
land

old

And
don

that

much
more
help

that

worse
thinking
afraid
that
only
too
true
Sam
said
Frodo
Yet
hope
very
much
that
before
leave
shall
see
the
Lady
the
Elves
again
Even
spoke
they
saw
she
came
answer
their
words
the
Lady
Galadriel
approaching
Tall
and
white
and
fair
she
walked
beneath
the
trees
She
spoke
word
but
beckoned
them
Turning
aside
she
led
them
towards
the
southern
slopes
the
hill
Caras
Galadhon
and
passing
through
high
green
hedge
they
came
into
enclosed
garden
trees
grew
there
and
lay
open
the
sky
The
evening
star
had
risen
and
was
shining
with
white
fire
above
the
western
woods
Down
long
flight
steps
the
Lady
went
into
the
deep
green
hollow
through
which
ran
murmuring
the
silver
stream
that
issued
from
the
fountain
the
hill
the
bottom
upon
low
pedestal
carved
like
branching
tree
stood
basin
silver
wide
and
shallow
and
beside
stood
silver
ewer
With
water
from
the
stream
Galadriel
filled
the
basin
the
brim
and
breathed
and
when
the
water
was
still
again
she
spoke
Here
the
Mirror
Galadriel
she
said
have
brought
you
here
that
you
may
look
you
will
The
air
was
very
still
and
the
dell
was
dark
and
the
Elf
lady
beside
him
was
tall
and
pale
What
shall
look
for
and
what
shall
see
asked
Frodo
filled
with
awe
Many
things
can
command
the
Mirror
reveal
she
answered
and
some
can
show
what
they
desire
see
But
the
Mirror
will
also
show
things
unbidden
and
those
are
often
stranger
and
more
profitable
than
things
which
wish
behold

For

But
which

even

you

Frodo
did
not
answer
And
you
she
said
turning
Sam
For
this
what
your
folic
would
call
magic
believe
though
not
understand
clearly
what
they
mean
and
they
seem
use
the
same
word
the
deceits
the
Enemy
But
this
you
will
the
magic
Galadriel
Did
you
not
say
that
you
wished
see
Elf
magic
did
said
Sam
trembling
little
between
fear
and
curi
osity
have
peep
Lady
you
willing
And
not
mind
glimpse
what

said
aside
Frodo
seems
terrible
long
time
that

away
But
there
like
not
only
see
the

something
that
won
understand
Like
not
said
the
Lady
with
gentle
laugh
But
come
you
shall
look
and
see
what
you
may
not
touch
the
water
Sam
climbed
the
foot
the
pedestal
and
leaned
over
the
basin
The
water
looked
hard
and
dark
Stars
were
reflected
There
only
stars
thought
said
Then
gave
low
gasp
for
the
stars
went
out
dark
veil
had
been
withdrawn
the
Mirror
grew
grey
and
then
clear
There
was
sun
shining
and
the
branches
trees
were
waving
and
toss
ing
the
wind
But
before
Sam
could
make
his
mind
what
was
that
saw
the
light
faded
and
now
thought
saw
Frodo
with
pale
face
lying
fast
asleep
under
great
dark
cliff
Then
seemed
see
himself
going
along
dim
passage
and
climbing
endless
winding
stair
came
him
suddenly
that
was
looking
urgently
for
something
but
what
was
did
not
know
Like
dream
the
vision
shifted
and
went
back
and
saw
the
trees
again
But
this
time
they
were
not
close
and
could
see
what
was
going
they
were
not
waving
the
wind
they
were
falling
crashing
the
ground

There

But
now
Sam
noticed
that
the
Old

had
vanished
and
large
red
brick
building
was
being
put
where
had
stood
Lots
folk
were

There
was
tall

Black

seemed
cloud
the

the

There
some
devilry
work
the

said
Elrond
knew
what

about
when
wanted

Then
suddenly
Sam
gave
cry
and
sprang
away
can

said
wildly

They
dug
Bagshot
Row
and
there
the
poor
old
Gaffer
going
down
the

with
his
bits
things
barrow
must
home
You
cannot
home
alone
said
the
Lady
You
did
not
wish
home
without
your
master
before
you
looked
the
Mirror
and
yet
you
knew
that
evil
things
might
well
happening
the
Shire
Remember
that
the
Mirror
shows
many
things
and
not
all
have
yet
come

Some
never
come
unless
those
that
behold
the

turn

from

sat
the

and
put

his

said
and
fell
silent
After
moment
spoke
again
thickly
struggling
with

home
the

with
Frodo
not

But

said
Frodo
and
climbed
the
pedestal
and
bent
over
the
dark
water
once
the
Mirror
cleared
and
saw

Mountains

Far

figure
came
slowly
down
the
road
faint
and
small
first
but
growing
larger
and
clearer
approached
Suddenly
Frodo
realized
that
reminded
him
Gandalf
almost
called
aloud
the
wizard
name
and
then
saw
that
the
figure
was
clothed
not
grey
but
white
white
that
shone
faintly
the
dusk
and
its
hand
there
was
white
staff
The
head
was
bowed
that
could
see
face
and
presently
the
figure
turned
aside
round
bend
the
road
and
went
out
the
Mirror
view
Doubt
came
into
Frodo
mind
was
this
vision
Gandalf
one
his
many
lonely
journeys
long
ago
was
Saruman
The
vision
now
changed
Brief
and
small
but
very
vivid
caught
glimpse
Bilbo
walking
restlessly
about
his
room
The
table
was
littered
with
disordered
papers
rain
was
beat
ing
the
windows
Then
there
was
pause
and
after
many
swift
scenes
followed
that
Frodo
some
way
knew
parts
great
history
which
had
become
involved
The
mist
cleared
and
saw
sight
which
had
never
seen
before
but
knew
once
the
Sea
Darkness
fell
The
sea
rose
and
raged
great
storm
Then
saw
against
the
Sun
sinking
blood
red
into
wrack
clouds
the
black
outline
tall
ship
with
torn
sails
riding
out
the
West
Then
wide
river
flowing
through
populous
city
Then
white
fortress
with
seven
towers
And
then
again
ship
with
black
sails
but
now
was
morning
again
and
the
water
rippled
with
light
and

bearing

arose
and
again
the

went
down
burning

that
faded
into
grey
mist
and
into
the

small
ship
passed
away
twinkling
with

vanished
and
Frodo
sighed
and
prepared
draw
away
But
suddenly
the
Mirror
went
altogether
dark
dark
hole
had
opened
the
world
sight
and
Frodo
looked
into
emptiness
the
black
abyss
there
appeared
single
Eye
that
slowly
grew
until
filled
nearly
all
the
Mirror
terrible
was
that
Frodo
stood
rooted
unable
cry
out
withdraw
his
gaze
The
Eye
was
rimmed
with
fire
but
was
itself
glazed
yellow
cat
watchful
and
intent
and
the
black
slit
its
pupil
opened
pit
window
into
nothing
Then
the
Eye
began
rove
searching
this
way
and
that
and
Frodo
knew
with
certainty
and
horror
that
among
the
many
things
that
sought
himself
was
one
But
also
knew
that
could
not
see
him
not
yet
not
unless
willed
The
Ring
that
hung
upon
its
chain
about
his
neck
grew
heavy
heavier
than
great
stone
and
his
head
was
dragged
downwards
The
Mirror
seemed
growing
hot
and
curls
steam
were
rising
from
the
water
was
slipping
forward
not
touch
the
water
said
the
Lady
Galadriel
softly
The
vision
faded
and
Frodo
found
that
was
looking
the
cool
stars
twinkling
the
silver
basin
stepped
back
shaking
all
over
and
looked
the

But
not

answered
The

deeper
than

the

their

For
many

had
pondered
what
might
should
the
Great
Ring
come
into
hands
and
behold
was
brought
within
grasp
The
evil
that
was
devised
long
ago
works
many
ways
whether
Sauron
himself
stands
falls
Would
not
that
have
been
noble
deed
set
the
credit
his
Ring
had
taken
force
fear
from
guest
And
now
last
comes
You
will
give
the

you
will

And

Stronger

All

She
lifted
her
hand
and
from
the
ring
that
she
wore
there
issued
great
light
that
illumined
her
alone
and
left
all
else
dark
She
stood
before
Frodo
seeming
now
tall
beyond
measurement
and
beautiful
beyond
enduring
terrible
and
worshipful
Then
she
let
her
hand
fall
and
the
light
faded
and
suddenly
she
laughed
again
and
she
was
shrunken

again

tell

FAREWELL
LORIEN
That
night
the
Company
was
again
summoned
the
chamber
Celeborn
and
there
the
Lord
and
Lady
greeted
them
with
fair
words
length
Celeborn
spoke
their
departure
Now
the
time
said
when
those
who
wish
con
tinue
the
Quest
must
harden
their
hearts
leave
this
land
Those
who
longer
wish
forward
may
remain
here
for
while
But
whether
they
stay
none
can
sure
peace
For
are
come
now
the
edge
doom
Here
those
who
wish
may
await
the
oncoming
the
hour
till
either
the
ways
the
world
lie
open
again
summon
them
the
last
need
Lorien
Then
they
may
return
their
own
lands
else
the
long
home
those
that
fall
battle
There
was
silence
They
all
resolved
forward
said
Galadriel
looking
their
eyes
for
said
Boromir
way
home
lies
onward
and
not
back
That
true
said
Celeborn
but
all
this
Company
going
with
you
Minas
Tirith
have
not
decided
our
course
said
Aragorn
Beyond
Lothlorien
not
know
what
Gandalf
intended
Indeed
not
think
that
even
had
any
clear
purpose
Maybe
not
said
Celeborn
yet
when
you
leave
this
land
you
can
longer
forget
the
Great
River
some
you
know
well
cannot
crossed
travellers
with
baggage
between
Lorien
and
Gondor
save
boat
And
are
not
the
bridges
Osgiliath
broken
down
and
all
the
landings
held
now
the
Enemy
which
side
will
you
journey
The
way
Minas
Tirith
lies
upon
this
side
upon
the
west
but
the
straight
road
the
FAREWELL
LORIEN
479
Quest
lies
east
the
River
upon
the
darker
shore
Which
shore
will
you
now
take
advice
heeded
will
the
western
shore
and
the
way
Minas
Tirith
answered
Boromir
But
not
the
leader
the
Company
The
others
said
nothing
and
Aragorn
looked
doubtful
and
troubled
see
that
you
not
yet
know
what
said
Celeborn
not
part
choose
for
you
but
will
help
you
may
There
are
some
among
you
who
can
handle
boats
Legolas
whose
folk
know
the
swift
Forest
River
and
Boromir
Gondor
and
Aragorn
the
traveller
And
one
Hobbit
cried
Merry
Not
all
look
boats
wild
horses
people
live
the
banks
the
Brandywine
That
well
said
Celeborn
Then
will
furnish
your
Company
with
boats
They
must
small
and
light
for
you
far
water
there
are
places
where
you
will
forced
carry
them
You
will
come
the
rapids
Sarn
Gebir
and
maybe
last
the
great
falls
Rauros
where
the
River
thunders
down
from
Nen
Hithoel
and
there
are
other
perils
Boats
may
make
your
journey
less
toilsome
for
while
Yet
they
will
not
give
you
counsel
the
end
you
must
leave
them
and
the
River
and
turn
west
east
Aragorn
thanked
Celeborn
many
times
The
gift
boats
comforted
him
much
not
least
because
there
would
now
need
decide
his
course
for
some
days
The
others
too
looked
more
hopeful
Whatever
perils
lay
ahead
seemed
better
float
down
the
broad
tide
Anduin
meet
them
than
plod
forward
with
bent
backs
Only
Sam
was
doubt
ful
any
rate
still
thought
boats
bad
wild
horses
worse
and
not
all
the
dangers
that
had
survived
made
him
think
better
them
All
shall
prepared
for
you
and
await
you
the
haven
before
noon
tomorrow
said
Celeborn
will
send
people
you
the
morning
help
you
make
ready
for
the
journey
Now
will
wish
you
all
fair
night
and
untroubled
sleep
Good
night
friends
said
Galadriel
Sleep
peace

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
not
trouble
your
hearts
overmuch
with
thought
the
road
tonight
Maybe
the
paths
that
you
each
shall
tread
are
already
laid
before
your
feet
though
you
not
see
them
Good
night
The
Company
now
took
their
leave
and
returned
their
pavilion
Legolas
went
with
them
for
this
was
their
last
night
Lothlorien
and
spite
the
words
Galadriel
they
wished
take
counsel
together
For
long
time
they
debated
what
they
should
and
how
would
best
attempt
the
fulfilling
their
purpose
with
the
Ring
but
they
came
decision
was
plain
that
most
them
desired
first
Minas
Tirith
and
escape
least
for
while
from
the
terror
the
Enemy
They
would
have
been
willing
follow
leader
over
the
River
and
into
the
shadow
Mordor
but
Frodo
spoke
word
and
Aragorn
was
still
divided
his
mind
His
own
plan
while
Gandalf
remained
with
them
had
been
with
Boromir
and
with
his
sword
help
deliver
Gondor
For
believed
that
the
message
the
dreams
was
summons
and
that
the
hour
had
come
last
when
the
heir
Elendil
should
come
forth
and
strive
with
Sauron
for
the
mastery
But
Moria
the
burden
Gandalf
had
been
laid
him
and
knew
that
could
not
now
forsake
the
Ring
Frodo
refused
the
end
with
Boromir
And
yet
what
help
could
any
the
Company
give
Frodo
save
walk
blindly
with
him
into
the
darkness
shall
Minas
Tirith
alone
need
for
duty
said
Boromir
and
after
that
was
silent
for
while
sitting
with
his
eyes
fixed
Frodo
was
trying
read
the
Halfling
thoughts
length
spoke
again
softly
was
debating
with
himself
you
wish
only
destroy
the
Ring
said
then
there
little
use
war
and
weapons
and
the
Men
Minas
Tirith
cannot
help
But
you
wish
destroy
the
armed
might
the
Dark
Lord
then
folly
without
force
into
his
domain
and
folly
throw
away
paused
suddenly
had
become
aware
that
was
FAREWELL
LORIEN
481
speaking
his
thoughts
aloud
would
folly
throw
lives
away
mean
ended
choice
between
defending
strong
place
and
walking
openly
into
the
arms
death
least
that
how
see
Frodo
caught
something
new
and
strange
Boromir
glance
and
looked
hard
him
Plainly
Boromir
thought
was
different
from
his
final
words
would
folly
throw
away
what
The
Ring
Power
had
said
something
like
this
the
Council
but
then
had
accepted
the
correction
Elrond
Frodo
looked
Aragorn
but
seemed
deep
his
own
thought
and
made
sign
that
had
heeded
Boromir
words
And
their
debate
ended
Merry
and
Pippin
were
already
asleep
and
Sam
was
nodding
The
night
was
growing
old
the
morning
they
were
beginning
pack
their
slen
der
goods
Elves
that
could
speak
their
tongue
came
them
and
brought
them
many
gifts
food
and
clothing
for
the
journey
The
food
was
mostly
the
form
very
thin
cakes
made
meal
that
was
baked
light
brown
the
outside
and
inside
was
the
colour
cream
Gimli
took
one
the
cakes
and
looked
with
doubtful
eye
Cram
said
under
his
breath
broke
off
crisp
corner
and
nibbled
His
expression
quickly
changed
and
ate
all
the
rest
the
cake
with
relish
more
more
cried
the
Elves
laughing
You
have
eaten
enough
already
for
long
day
march
thought
was
only
kind
cram
such
the
Dale
men
make
for
journeys
the
wild
said
the
Dwarf
they
answered
But
call
lembas
waybread
and
more
strengthening
than
any
food
made
Men
and
more
pleasant
than
cram
all
accounts
Indeed
said
Gimli
Why
better
than
the
honey
cakes
the
Beornings
and
that
great
praise
for
the
Beornings
are
the
best
bakers
that
know
but
they
are
none
too
willing
deal
out
their
cakes
travellers
these
days
You
are
kindly
hosts
482
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
All
the
same
bid
you
spare
the
food
they
said
Eat
little
time
and
only
need
For
these
things
are
given
serve
you
when
all
else
fails
The
cakes
will
keep
sweet
for
many
many
days
they
are
unbroken
and
left
their
leaf
wrappings
have
brought
them
One
will
keep
traveller
his
feet
for
day
long
labour
even
one
the
tall
Men
Minas
Tirith
The
Elves
next
unwrapped
and
gave
each
the
Com
pany
the
clothes
they
had
brought
For
each
they
had
pro
vided
hood
and
cloak
made
according
his
size
the
light
but
warm
silken
stuff
that
the
Galadhrim
wove
was
hard
say
what
colour
they
were
grey
with
the
hue
twilight
under
the
trees
they
seemed
and
yet
they
were
moved
set
another
light
they
were
green
shadowed
leaves
brown
fallow
fields
night
dusk
silver
water
under
the
stars
Each
cloak
was
fastened
about
the
neck
with
brooch
like
green
leaf
veined
with
silver
Are
these
magic
cloaks
asked
Pippin
looking
them
with
wonder
not
know
what
you
mean
that
answered
the
leader
the
Elves
They
are
fair
garments
and
the
web
good
for
was
made
this
land
They
are
Elvish
robes
certainly
that
what
you
mean
Leaf
and
branch
water
and
stone
they
have
the
hue
and
beauty
all
these
things
under
the
twilight
Lorien
that
love
for
put
the
thought
all
that
love
into
all
that
make
Yet
they
are
garments
not
armour
and
they
will
not
turn
shaft
blade
But
they
should
serve
you
well
they
are
light
wear
and
warm
enough
cool
enough
need
And
you
will
find
them
great
aid
keeping
out
the
sight
unfriendly
eyes
whether
you
walk
among
the
stones
the
trees
You
are
indeed
high
the
favour
the
Lady
For
she
herself
and
her
maidens
wove
this
stuff
and
never
before
have
clad
strangers
the
garb
our
own
people
After
their
morning
meal
the
Company
said
farewell
the
lawn
the
fountain
Their
hearts
were
heavy
for
was
FAREWELL
LORIEN
483
fair
place
and
had
become
like
home
them
though
they
could
not
count
the
days
and
nights
that
they
had
passed
there
they
stood
for
moment
looking
the
white
water
the
sunlight
Haldir
came
walking
towards
them
over
the
green
grass
the
glade
Frodo
greeted
him
with
delight
have
returned
from
the
Northern
Fences
said
the
Elf
and
sent
now
your
guide
again
The
Dimrill
Dale
full
vapour
and
clouds
smoke
and
the
mountains
are
troubled
There
are
noises
the
deeps
the
earth
any
you
had
thought
returning
northwards
your
homes
you
would
not
have
been
able
pass
that
way
But
come
Your
path
now
goes
south
they
walked
through
Caras
Galadhon
the
green
ways
were
empty
but
the
trees
above
them
many
voices
were
murmuring
and
singing
They
themselves
went
silently
last
Haldir
led
them
down
the
southward
slopes
the
hill
and
they
came
again
the
great
gate
hung
with
lamps
and
the
white
bridge
and
they
passed
out
and
left
the
city
the
Elves
Then
they
turned
away
from
the
paved
road
and
took
path
that
went
off
into
deep
thicket
mallorn
trees
and
passed
winding
through
rolling
woodlands
silver
shadow
leading
them
ever
down
southwards
and
east
wards
towards
the
shores
the
River
They
had
gone
some
ten
miles
and
noon
was
hand
when
they
came
high
green
wall
Passing
through
opening
they
came
suddenly
out
the
trees
Before
them
lay
long
lawn
shining
grass
studded
with
golden
elanor
that
glinted
the
sun
The
lawn
ran
out
into
narrow
tongue
between
bright
margins
the
right
and
west
the
Silverlode
flowed
glittering
the
left
and
east
the
Great
River
rolled
its
broad
waters
deep
and
dark
the
further
shores
the
woodlands
still
marched
southwards
far
eye
could
see
but
all
the
banks
were
bleak
and
bare
mallorn
lifted
its
gold
hung
boughs
beyond
the
Land
Lorien
the
hank
the
Silverlode
some
distance
from
the
meeting
the
streams
there
was
hythe
white
stones
and
white
wood
were
moored
many
boats
and
barges
484
the
fellowship
the
ring
Some
were
brightly
painted
and
shone
with
silver
and
gold
and
green
but
most
were
either
white
grey
Three
small
grey
boats
had
been
made
ready
for
the
travellers
and
these
the
Elves
stowed
their
goods
And
they
added
also
coils
rope
three
each
boat
Slender
they
looked
but
strong
silken
the
touch
grey
hue
like
the
elven
cloaks
What
are
these
asked
Sam
handling
one
that
lay
upon
the
greensward
Ropes
indeed
answered
Elf
from
the
boats
Never
travel
far
without
rope
And
one
that
long
and
strong
and
light
Such
are
these
They
may
help
many
needs
You
don
need
tell
that
said
Sam
came
without
any
and
been
worried
ever
since
But
was
wondering
what
these
were
made
knowing
bit
about
rope
making
the
family
you
might
say
They
are
made
hithlain
said
the
Elf
but
there
time
now
instruct
you
the
art
their
making
Had
known
that
this
craft
delighted
you
could
have
taught
you
much
But
now
alas
unless
you
should
some
time
return
hither
you
must
content
with
our
gift
May
serve
you
well
Come
said
Haldir
All
now
ready
for
you
Enter
the
boats
But
take
care
first
Heed
the
words
said
the
other
Elves
These
boats
are
light
built
and
they
are
crafty
and
unlike
the
boats
other
folic
They
will
not
sink
lade
them
you
will
but
they
are
wayward
mishandled
would
wise
you
accustomed
yourselves
stepping
and
out
here
where
there
landing
place
before
you
set
off
downstream
The
Company
was
arranged
this
way
Aragorn
Frodo
and
Sam
were
one
boat
Boromir
Merry
and
Pippin
another
and
the
third
were
Legolas
and
Gimli
who
had
now
become
fast
friends
this
last
boat
most
the
goods
and
packs
were
stowed
The
boats
were
moved
and
steered
with
short
handled
paddles
that
had
broad
leaf
shaped
blades
When
all
was
ready
Aragorn
led
them

FAREWELL

the
Silverlode
The
current
was
swift
and
they
went
forward
slowly
Sam
sat
the
bows
clutching
the
sides
and
looking
back
wistfully
the
shore
The
sunlight
glittering
the
water
dazzled
his
eyes
they
passed
beyond
the
green
field
the
Tongue
the
trees
drew
down
the
river
brink
Here
and
there
golden
leaves
tossed
and
floated
the
rippling
stream
The
air
was
very
bright
and
still
and
there
was
silence
except
for
the
high
distant
song
larks
They
turned
sharp
bend
the
river
and
there
sailing
proudly
down
the
stream
towards
them
they
saw
swan
great
size
The
water
rippled
either
side
the
white
breast
beneath
its
curving
neck
Its
beak
shone
like
burnished
gold
and
its
eyes
glinted
like
jet
set
yellow
stones
its
huge
white
wings
were
half
lifted
music
came
down
the
river
drew
nearer
and
suddenly
they
perceived
that
was

wrought
and
carved
with
elven
skill
the

Two
elves
clad
white
steered
with
black
paddles
the

sat
Celeborn
and
behind
him
stood
Galadriel
tall
and
white
circlet
golden

was
her
hair
and
her
hand
she
held
harp
and
she
sang
Sad
and
sweet
was
the
sound
her
voice
the
cool
clear
air
sang
leaves
leaves
gold
and
leaves
gold
there
grew
wind
sang
wind
there
came
and
the

blew
Beyond
the

beyond
the

the

was
the

And
the

there
grew

Ever

There

upon

While

now
fall
the
Elven

Lorien
The
Winter

the

The

Too

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
But
ships
now
should
sing
what
ship
would
come
What
ship
would
bear
ever
back
across
wide
Sea
Aragorn
stayed
his
boat
the
Swan
ship
drew
alongside
The
Lady
ended
her
song
and
greeted
them
have
come
bid
our
last
farewell
she
said
and
speed
you
with
blessings
from
our
land
Though
you
have
been
our

said
Celeborn
you
have
not
yet
eaten

bid
you
therefore
parting
feast
here
between
the
flowing
waters
that
will
bear
you
far
from
Lorien
The
Swan
passed
slowly
the
hythe
and
they
turned
their
boats
and
followed
There
the
last
end
Egladil
upon
the
green
grass
the
parting
feast
was
held
but
Frodo
ate
and
drank
little
heeding
only
the
beauty
the
Lady
and
her
voice
She
seemed
longer
perilous
terrible
nor
filled
with
hidden
power
Already
she
seemed

Elves
still

that

sitting
upon

grass
Celeborn
spoke
them
again
their
journey
and
lifting
his
hand
pointed
south
the
woods
beyond
the
Tongue
you
down
the
water
said
you
will
find
that
the
trees
will
fail
and
you
will
come
barren
country
There
the
River
flows
stony
vales
amid
high
moors
until
last
after
many
leagues
comes
the
tall
island
the
Tindrock
that
call
Tol
Brandir
There
casts
its
arms
about
the
steep
shores
the
isle
and
falls
then
with
great
noise
and
smoke
over
the
cataracts
Rauros
down
into
the
Nindalf
the
Wetwang
called
your
tongue
That
wide
region
sluggish
fen
where
the
stream
becomes
tortuous
and
much
divided
There
the
Entwash
flows
many
mouths
from
the
Forest
Fangorn
the
west
About
that
stream
this
side
the
Great
River
lies
Rohan
the
FAREWELL
LORIEN
487
further
side
are
the
bleak
hills
the
Emyn
Muil
The
wind
blows
from
the
East
there
for
they
look
out
over
the
Dead
Marshes
and
the
Noman
lands
Cirith
Gorgor
and
the
black
gates
Mordor
Boromir
and
any
that
with
him
seeking
Minas
Tirith
will
well
leave
the
Great
River
above
Rauros
and
cross
the
Entwash
before
finds
the
marshes
Yet
they
should
not
too
far
that
stream
nor
risk
becoming
entangled
the
Forest
Fangorn
That
strange
land
and
now
little
known
But
Boromir
and
Aragorn
doubtless
not
need
this
warning
Indeed
have
heard
Fangorn
Minas
Tirith
said
Boromir
But
what
have
heard
seems
for
the
most
part
old
wives
tales
such
tell
our
children
All
that
lies
north
Rohan
now
far
away
that
fancy
can
wander
freely
there
old
Fangorn
lay
upon
the
borders
our
realm
but
now
many
lives
men
since
any
visited
prove
disprove
the
legends
that
have
come
down
from
distant
years
have
myself
been
whiles
Rohan
but
have
never
crossed
northwards
When
was
sent
out
messenger
passed
through
the
Gap
the
skirts
the
White
Moun
tains
and
crossed
the
Isen
and
the
Greyflood
into
Norther
land
long
and
wearisome
journey
Four
hundred
leagues
reckoned
and
took
many
months
for
lost
horse
Tharbad
the
fording
the
Greyflood
After
that
journey
and
the
road
have
trodden
with
this
Company
not
much
doubt
that
shall
find
way
through
Rohan
and
Fangorn
too
need
Then
need
say
more
said
Celeborn
But
not
despise
the
lore
that
has
come
down
from
distant
years
for
oft
may
chance
that
old
wives
keep
memory
word
things
that
once
were
needful
for
the
wise
know
Now
Galadriel
rose
from
the
grass
and
taking
cup
from
one
her
maidens
she
filled
with
white
mead
and
gave
Celeborn
488
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
Now
time
drink
the
cup
farewell
she
said
Drink
Lord
the
Galadhrim
And
let
not
your
heart
sad
though
night
must
follow
noon
and
already
our
evening
draweth
nigh
Then
she
brought
the
cup
each
the
Company
and
bade
them
drink
and
farewell
But
when
they
had
drunk
she
commanded
them
sit
again
the
grass
and
chairs
were
set
for
her
and
for
Celeborn
Her
maidens
stood
silent
about
her
and
while
she
looked
upon
her
guests
last
she
spoke
again
have
drunk
the
cup
parting
she
said
and
the
shadows
fall
between
But
before
you
have
brought
ship
gifts
which
the
Lord
and
Lady
the
Galadhrim
now
offer
you
memory
Lothlorien
Then
she
called
each
turn
Here
the
gift
Celeborn
and
Galadriel
the
leader
your
Company
she
said
Aragorn
and
she
gave
him
sheath
that
had
been
made
fit
his
sword
was
overlaid
with
tracery
flowers
and
leaves
wrought
silver
and
gold
and
were
set
elven
runes
formed
many
gems
the
name
Anduril
and
the
lineage
the
sword
The
blade
that
drawn
from
this
sheath
shall
not
stained
broken
even
defeat
she
said
But
there
aught
else
that
you
desire
our
parting
For
darkness
will
flow
between
and
may
that
shall
not
meet
again
unless
far
hence
upon
road
that
has
returning
And
Aragorn
answered
Lady
you
know
all
desire
and
long
held
keeping
the
only
treasure
that
seek
Yet
not
yours
give
even
you
would
and
only
through
darkness
shall
come
Yet
maybe
this
will
lighten
your
heart
said
Galadriel
for
was
left
care
given
you
should
you
pass
through
this
land
Then
she
lifted
from
her
lap
great
stone
clear
green
set
silver
brooch
that
was
wrought
the
likeness
eagle
with
outspread
wings
and
she
held
the
gem
flashed
like
the
sun
shining
through
the
leaves
spring
This
stone
gave
Celebrian
daughter
and
FAREWELL
LORIEN
489
she
hers
and
now
comes
you
token
hope
this
hour
take
the
name
that
was
foretold
for
you
Elessar
the
Elfstone
the
House
Elendil
Then
Aragorn
took
the
stone
and
pinned
the
brooch
upon
his
breast
and
those
who
saw
him
wondered
for
they
had
not
marked
before
how
tall
and
kingly
stood
and
seemed
them
that
many
years
toil
had
fallen
from
his
shoulders
For
the
gifts
that
you
have
given
thank
you
said
Lady
Lorien
whom
were
sprung
Celebrian
and
Arwen
Evenstar
What
praise
could
say
more
The
Lady
bowed
her
head
and
she
turned
then
Boro
mir
and
him
she
gave
belt
gold
and
Merry
and
Pippin
she
gave
small
silver
belts
each
with
clasp
wrought
like
golden
flower
Legolas
she
gave
bow
such
the
Galadhrim
used
longer
and
stouter
than
the
bows
Mirkwood
and
strung
with
string
elf
hair
With
went
quiver
arrows
For
you
little
gardener
and
lover
trees
she
said
Sam
have
only
small
gift
She
put
into
his
hand
little
box
plain
grey
wood
unadorned
save
for
single
silver
rune
upon
the
lid
Here
set
for
Galadriel
she
said
but
also
may
stand
for
garden
your
tongue
this
box
there
earth
from
orchard
and
such
blessing
Galadriel
has
still
bestow
upon
will
not
keep
you
your
road
nor
defend
you
against
any
peril
but
you
keep
and
see
your
home
again
last
then
perhaps
may
reward
you
Though
you
should
find
all
barren
and
laid
waste
there
will
few
gardens
Middle
earth
that
will
bloom
like
your
garden
you
sprinkle
this
earth
there
Then
you
may
remember
Galadriel
and
catch
glimpse
far
off
Lorien
that
you
have
seen
only
our
winter
For
our
Spring
and
our
Summer
are
gone
and
they
will
never
seen
earth
again
save
memory
Sam
went
red
the
ears
and
muttered
something
inaud
ible
clutched
the
box
and
bowed
well
could
And
what
gift
would
Dwarf
ask
the
Elves
said
Galadriel
turning
Gimli
490
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
None
Lady
answered
Gimli
enough
for
have
seen
the
Lady
the
Galadhrim
and
have
heard
her
gentle
words
Hear
all
Elves
she
cried
those
about
her
Let
none
say
again
that
Dwarves
are
grasping
and
ungracious
Yet
surely
Gimli
son
Gloin
you
desire
something
that
could
give
Name
bid
you
You
shall
not
the
only
guest
without
gift
There
nothing
Lady
Galadriel
said
Gimli
bowing
low
and
stammering
Nothing
unless
might
unless
permitted
ask
nay
name
single
strand
your
hair
which
surpasses
the
gold
the
earth
the
stars
surpass
the
gems
the
mine
not
ask
for
such
gift
But
you
commanded
name
desire
The
Elves
stirred
and
murmured
with
astonishment
and
Celeborn
gazed
the
Dwarf
wonder
but
the
Lady
smiled
said
that
the
skill
the
Dwarves
their
hands
rather
than
their
tongues
she
said
yet
that
not
true
Gimli
For
none
have
ever
made
request
bold
and
yet
courteous
And
how
shall
refuse
since
commanded
him
speak
But
tell
what
would
you
with
such
gift
Treasure
Lady
answered
memory
your
words
our
first
meeting
And
ever
return
the
smithies
home
shall
set
imperishable
crystal
heirloom
house
and
pledge
good
will
between
the
Mountain
and
the
Wood
until
the
end
days
Then
the
Lady
unbraided
one
her
long
tresses
and
cut
off
three
golden
hairs
and
laid
them
Gimli
hand
These
words
shall
with
the
gift
she
said
not
foretell
for
all
foretelling
now
vain
the
one
hand
lies
darkness
and
the
other
only
hope
But
hope
should
not
fail
then
say
you
Gimli
son
Gloin
that
your
hands
shall
flow
with
gold
and
yet
over
you
gold
shall
have
dominion
And
you
Ring
bearer
she
said
turning
Frodo
come
you
last
who
are
not
last
thoughts
For
you
have
prepared
this
She
held
small
crystal
phial
glittered
FAREWELL
LORIEN
491
she
moved
and
rays
white
light
sprang
from
her
hand
this
phial
she
said
caught
the
light
Earendil
star
set
amid
the
waters
fountain
will
shine
still
brighter
when
night
about
you
May
light
you
dark
places
when
all
other
lights
out
Remember
Galadriel
and
her
Mirror
Frodo
took
the
phial
and
for
moment
shone
between
them
saw
her
again
standing
like
queen
great
and
beautiful
but
longer
terrible
bowed
but
found
words
say
Now
the
Lady
arose
and
Celeborn
led
them
back
the
hythe
yellow
noon
lay
the
green
land
the
Tongue
and
the
water
glittered
with
silver
All
last
was
made
ready
The
Company
took
their
places
the
boats
before
Crying
farewell
the
Elves
Lorien
with
long
grey
poles
thrust
them
out
into
the
flowing
stream
and
the
rippling
waters
bore
them
slowly
away
The
travellers
sat
still
without
moving
speaking
the
green
hank
near
the
very
point
the
Tongue
the
Lady
Galadriel
stood
alone
and
silent
they
passed
her
they
turned
and
their
eyes
watched
her
slowly
floating
away
from
them
For
seemed
them
Lorien
was
slipping
backward
like
bright
ship
masted
with
enchanted
trees
sailing
forgotten
shores
while
they
sat
helpless
upon
the
margin
the
grey
and
leafless
world
Even
they
gazed
the
Silverlode
passed
out
into
the
currents
the
Great
River
and
their
boats
turned
and
began
speed
southward
Soon
the
white
form
the
Lady
was
small
and
distant
She
shone
like
window
glass
upon
far
hill
the
westering
sun
remote
lake
seen
from
mountain
crystal
fallen
the
lap
the
land
Then
seemed
Frodo
that
she
lifted
her
arms
final
farewell
and
far
but
piercing
clear
the
following
wind
came
the
sound
her
voice
singing
But
now
she
sang
the
ancient
tongue
the
Elves
beyond
the
Sea
and
did
not
under
stand
the
words
fair
was
the
music
but
did
not
comfort
him
492
THE

Yet
the
way
Elvish
words
they
remained
graven
his
memory
and
long
afterwards
interpreted

was

Suddenly
the
River
swept
round
bend
and
the
banks
rose
upon
either
side
and
the
light
Lorien
was
hidden
that
fair
land
Frodo
never
came
again
The
travellers
now
turned
their
faces
the
journey
the
sun
was
before
them
and
their
eyes
were
dazzled
for
all
were
filled
with
tears
Gimli
wept
openly
have
looked
the
last
upon
that
which
was
fairest
said
Legolas
his
companion
Henceforward
will
call
nothing
fair
unless
her
gift
put
his
hand
his
breast
Tell
Legolas
why
did
come
this
Quest
Little
did
know
where
the
chief
peril
lay
Truly
Elrond
spoke
saying
that
could
not
foresee
what
might
meet
upon
our
road
Torment
the
dark
was
the
danger
that
feared
and
did
not
hold
back
But
would
not
have
come
had
known
the
danger
light
and
joy
Now
have
taken
worst
wound
this
parting
even
were
this
night
straight
the
Dark
Lord
Alas
for
Gimli
son
Gloin
Nay
said
Legolas
Alas
for
all
And
for
all
that
walk
the
world
these
after
days
For
such
the
way
find
and
lose
seems
those
whose
boat
the
running
stream
But
count
you
blessed
Gimli
son
Gloin
for
your
loss
you
suffer
your
own
free
will
and
you
might
have
chosen
otherwise
But
you
have
not
forsaken
your
com
panions
and
the
least
reward
that
you
shall
have
that
the
memory
Lothlorien
shall
remain
ever
clear
and
unstained
your
heart
and
shall
neither
fade
nor
grow
stale
Maybe
said
Gimli
and
thank
you
for
your
words
True
words
doubtless
yet
all
such
comfort
cold
Memory
not
what
the
heart
desires
That
only
mirror
clear
Kheled
zaram
says
the
heart
Gimli
the
Dwarf
Elves
may
see
things
otherwise
Indeed
have
heard
that
for
them
memory
more
like
the
waking
world
than
dream
Not
for
Dwarves
494
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
But
let
talk
more
Look
the
boat
She
too
low
the
water
with
all
this
baggage
and
the
Great
River
swift
not
wish
drown
grief
cold
water
took
paddle
and
steered
towards
the
western
bank
following
Aragorn
boat
ahead
which
had
already
moved
out
the
middle
stream
the
Company
went
their
long
way
down
the
wide
hurrying
waters
borne
ever
southwards
Bare
woods
stalked
along
either
bank
and
they
could
not
see
any
glimpse
the
lands
behind
The
breeze
died
away
and
the
River
flowed
without
sound
voice
bird
broke
the
silence
The
sun
grew
misty
the
day
grew
old
until
gleamed
pale
sky
like
high
white
pearl
Then
faded
into
the
West
and
dusk
came
early
followed
grey
and
starless
night
Far
into
the
dark
quiet
hours
they
floated
guiding
their
boats
under
the
overhanging
shadows
the
western
woods
Great
trees
passed
like
ghosts
thrusting
their
twisted
thirsty
roots
through
the
mist
down
into
the
water
was
dreary
and
cold
Frodo
sat
and
listened
the
faint
lap
and
gurgle
the
River
fretting
among
the
tree
roots
and
driftwood
near
the
shore
until
his
head
nodded
and
fell
into
uneasy
sleep
Chapter
THE
GREAT
RIVER
Frodo
was
roused
Sam
found
that
was
lying
well
wrapped
under
tall
grey
skinned
trees
quiet
corner
the
woodlands
the
west
bank
the
Great
River
Anduin
had
slept
the
night
away
and
the
grey
morning
was
dim
among
the
bare
branches
Gimli
was
busy
with
small
fire
near
hand
They
started
again
before
the
day
was
broad
Not
that
most
the
Company
were
eager
hurry
southwards
they
were
content
that
the
decision
which
they
must
make
latest
when
they
came
Rauros
and
the
Tindrock
Isle
still
lay
some
days
ahead
and
they
let
the
River
bear
them
its
own
pace
having
desire
hasten
towards
the
perils
that
lay
beyond
whichever
course
they
took
the
end
Aragorn
let
them
drift
with
the
stream
they
wished
husbanding
their
strength
against
weariness
come
But
insisted
that
least
they
should
start
early
each
day
and
journey
far
into
the
evening
for
felt
his
heart
that
time
was
pressing
and
feared
that
the
Dark
Lord
had
not
been
idle
while
they
lingered
Lorien
Nonetheless
they
saw
sign
any
enemy
that
day
nor
the
next
The
dull
grey
hours
passed
without
event
the
third
day
their
voyage
wore
the
lands
changed
slowly
the
trees
thinned
and
then
failed
altogether
the
eastern
bank
their
left
they
saw
long
formless
slopes
stretching
and

and

they
looked
fire
had
passed
over
them
leaving
living

the

They
had
come
the

Lands
that
lay
vast
and
desolate
between
Southern

THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
war
evil
deed
the
Enemy
had
blasted
all
that
region
even
Aragorn
could
not
tell
Upon
the
west
their
right
the
land
was
treeless
also
but
was
flat
and
many
places
green
with
wide
plains
grass
this
side
the
River
they
passed
forests
great
reeds
tall
that
they
shut
out
all
view
the
west
the
little
boats
went
rustling
along
their
fluttering
borders
Their
dark
withered
plumes
bent
and
tossed
the
light
cold
airs
hissing
softly
and
sadly
Here
and
there
through
open
ings
Frodo
could
catch
sudden
glimpses
rolling
meads
and
far
beyond
them
hills
the
sunset
and
away
the
edge
sight
dark
line
where
marched
the
southernmost
ranks
the
Misty
Mountains
There
was
sign
living
moving
things
save
birds
these
there
were
many
small
fowl
whistling
and
piping
the
reeds
but
they
were
seldom
seen
Once
twice
the
travellers
heard
the
rush
and
whine
swan
wings
and
looking
they
saw
great
phalanx
streaming
along
the
sky
Swans
said
Sam
And
mighty
big
ones
too
Yes
said
Aragorn
and
they
are
black
swans
How
wide
and
empty
and
mournful
all
this
country
looks
said
Frodo
always
imagined
that
one
journeyed
south
got
warmer
and
merrier
until
winter
was
left
behind
for
ever
But
have
not
journeyed
far
south
yet
answered
Aragorn
still
winter
and
are
far
from
the
sea
Here
the
world
cold
until
the
sudden
spring
and
may
yet
have
snow
again
Far
away
down
the
Bay
Belfalas
which
Anduin
runs
warm
and
merry
maybe
would
but
for
the
Enemy
But
here
are
not
above
sixty
leagues
guess
south
the
Southfarthing
away
your
Shire
hun
dreds
long

yonder
You
are
looking
now
south
west
across
the
north
plains
the
Riddermark
Rohan
the

the
Horse
lords
Ere
long
shall
come
the

the
Limlight
that
runs
down
from
Fangorn

the
Great

That
the

and

that
lay
between

THE

497
the
Rohirrim
rich
and
pleasant
land
and
its

has

but
these
evil
days
folk
not
dwell
the

ride
often
its
shores
Anduin
wide
yet
the

shoot

arrows
far
across

and

they
have
dared
cross
the

and
raid
the

and

Rohan
Sam
looked
from
bank
bank
uneasily
The
trees
had
seemed
hostile
before
they
harboured
secret
eyes
and
lurking
dangers
now
wished
that
the
trees
were
still
there
felt
that
the
Company
was
too
naked
afloat
little
open
boats
the
midst
shelterless
lands
and
river
that
was
the
frontier
war
the
next
day
two
they
went
borne
steadily
southwards
this
feeling
insecurity
grew
all
the
Com
pany
For
whole
day
they
took
their
paddles
and
hastened
forward
The
banks
slid
Soon
the
River
broadened
and
grew
more
shallow
long
stony
beaches
lay
upon
the
east
and
there
were
gravel
shoals
the
water
that
careful
steering
was
needed
The
Brown
Lands
rose
into
bleak
wolds
over
which
flowed
chill
air
from
the
East
the
other
side
the
meads
had
become
rolling
downs
withered
grass
amidst
land
fen
and
tussock
Frodo
shivered
thinking
the
lawns
and
fountains
the
clear
sun
and
gentle
rains
Lothlorien
There
was
little
speech
and
laughter
any
the
boats
Each
member
the
Company
was
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
The
heart
Legolas
was
running
under
the
stars
summer
night
some
northern
glade
amid
the
beech
woods
Gimli
was
fingering
gold
his
mind
and
wondering
were
fit
wrought
into
the
housing
the
Lady
gift
Merry
and
Pippin
the
middle
boat
were
ill
ease
for
Boromir
sat
muttering
himself
sometimes
biting
his
nails
some
restlessness
doubt
consumed
him
sometimes
seizing
paddle
and
driving
the
boat
close
behind
Aragorn
Then
Pippin
who
sat
the
bow
looking
back
caught
queer
gleam
his
eye
peered
forward
gazing
Frodo
Sam
had
long
ago
made
his
mind
that
though
boats
were
498
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
maybe
not
dangerous
had
been
brought
believe
they
were
far
more
uncomfortable
than
even
had
imag
ined
was
cramped
and
miserable
having
nothing
but
stare
the
winter
lands
crawling
and
the
grey
water
either
side
him
Even
when
the
paddles
were
use
they
did
not
trust
Sam
with
one
dusk
drew
down
the
fourth
day
was
looking
back
over
the
bowed
heads
Frodo
and
Aragorn
and
the
following
boats
was
drowsy
and
longed
for
camp
and
the
feel
earth
under
his
toes
Suddenly
something
caught
his
sight
first
stared
listlessly
then
sat
and
rubbed
his
eyes
but
when
looked
again
could
not
see
any
more
That
night
they
camped
small
eyot
close
the
western
bank
Sam
lay
rolled
blankets
beside
Frodo
had
funny
dream
hour
two
before
stopped
Frodo
said
maybe
wasn
dream
Funny
was
anyway
Well
what
was
said
Frodo
knowing
that
Sam
would
not
settle
down
until
had
told
his
tale
whatever
was
haven
seen
thought
anything
make
smile
since
left
Lothlorien
wasn
funny
that
way
Frodo
was
queer
All
wrong
wasn
dream
And
you
had
best
hear
was
like
this
saw
log
with
eyes
The
log
all
right
said
Frodo
There
are
many
the
River
But
leave
out
the
eyes
That
won
said
Sam
Twas
the
eyes
made
sit
speak
saw
what
took
log
floating
along
the
half
light
behind
Gimli
boat
but
didn
give
much
heed
Then
seemed
the
log
was
slowly
catching
And
that
was
peculiar
you
might
say
seeing
were
all
floating
the
stream
together
Just
then
saw
the
eyes
two
pale
sort
points
shiny
like
hump
the
near
end
the
log
What
more
wasn
log
for
had
paddle
feet
like
swan
almost
only
they
seemed
bigger
and
kept
dipping
and
out
the
water
THE
GREAT
RIVER
499
That
when
sat
right
and
rubbed
eyes
meaning
give
shout
was
still
there
when
had
rubbed
the
drowse
out
head
For
the
whatever
was
was
coming
along
fast
now
and
getting
close
behind
Gimli
But
whether
those
two
lamps
spotted
moving
and
staring
whether
came
senses
don
know
When
looked
again
wasn
there
Yet
think
caught
glimpse
with
the
tail
eye
the
saying
something
dark
shooting
under
the
shadow
the
bank
couldn
see
more
eyes
though
said
myself
dreaming
again
Sam
Gamgee
said
and
said
more
just
then
But
been
thinking
since
and
now
not
sure
What
you
make
Frodo
should
make
nothing
but
log
and
the
dusk
and
sleep
your
eyes
Sam
said
Frodo
this
was
the
first
time
that
those
eyes
had
been
seen
But
isn
saw
them
away
back
north
before
reached
Lorien
And
saw
strange
creature
with
eyes
climbing
the
flet
that
night
Haldir
saw
too
And
you
remember
the
report
the
Elves
that
went
after
the
ore
band
said
Sam
and
remember
more
too
don
like
thoughts
but
thinking
one
thing
and
another
and
Bilbo
stories
and
all
fancy
could
put
name
the
creature
guess
nasty
name
Gollum
maybe
Yes
that
what
have
feared
for
some
time
said
Frodo
Ever
since
the
night
the
flet
suppose
was
lurking
Moria
and
picked
our
trail
then
but
hoped
that
our
stay
Lorien
would
throw
him
off
the
scent
again
The
miserable
creature
must
have
been
hiding
the
woods
the
Silverlode
watching
start
off
That
about
said
Sam
And
better
bit
more
watchful
ourselves
feel
some
nasty
fingers
round
our
necks
one
these
nights
ever
wake
feel
anything
And
that
what
was
leading
need
trouble
Strider
the
others
tonight
keep
watch
can
sleep
tomorrow
being
more
than
luggage
boat
you
might
say
500
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
might
said
Frodo
and
might
say
luggage
with
eyes
You
shall
watch
but
only
you
promise
wake
half
way
towards
morning
nothing
happens
before
then
the
dead
hours
Frodo
came
out
deep
dark
sleep
find
Sam
shaking
him
shame
wake
you
whispered
Sam
but
that
what
you
said
There
nothing
tell
not
much
thought
heard
some
soft
plashing
and
sniffing
noise
while
back
but
you
hear
lot
such
queer
sounds
river
night
lay
down
and
Frodo
sat
huddled
his
blankets
and
fought
off
his
sleep
Minutes
hours
passed
slowly
and
nothing
happened
Frodo
was
just
yielding
the
temptation
lie
down
again
when
dark
shape
hardly
visible
floated
close
one
the
moored
boats
long
whitish
hand
could
dimly
seen
shot
out
and
grabbed
the
gunwale
two
pale
lamplike
eyes
shone
coldly
they
peered
inside
and
then
they
lifted
and
gazed
Frodo
the
eyot
They
were
not
more
than
yard
two
away
and
Frodo
heard
the
soft
hiss
intaken
breath
stood
drawing
Sting
from
its
sheath
and
faced
the
eyes
Immediately
their
light
was
shut
off
There
was
another
hiss
and
splash
and
the
dark
log
shape
shot
away
downstream
into
the
night
Aragorn
stirred
his
sleep
turned
over
and
sat
What
whispered
springing
and
coming
Frodo
felt
something
sleep
Why
have
you
drawn
your
sword
Gollum
answered
Frodo
least
guess
said
Aragorn
you
know
about
our
little
footpad
you
padded
after
all
through
Moria
and
right
down
Nimrodel
Since
took
boats
has
been
lying
log
and
paddling
with
hands
and
feet
have
tried
catch
him
once
twice
night
but
slier
than
fox
and
slippery
fish
hoped
the
river
voyage
would
beat
him
but
too
clever
waterman
shall
have
try
going
faster
tomorrow
You
lie
down
now
and
will
keep
watch
for
what
left
the
night
wish
THE
GREAT
RIVER
501
could
lay
hands
the
wretch
might
make
him
useful
But
cannot
shall
have
try
and
lose
him
very
dangerous
Quite
apart
from
murder
night
his
own
account
may
put
any
enemy
that
about
our
track
The
night
passed
without
Gollum
showing
much
shadow
again
After
that
the
Company
kept
sharp
look
out
but
they
saw
more
Gollum
while
the
voyage
lasted
was
still
following
was
very
wary
and
cunning
Aragorn
bidding
they
paddled
now
for
long
spells
and
the
banks
went
swiftly
But
they
saw
little
the
country
for
they
journeyed
mostly
night
and
twilight
resting
day
and
lying
hidden
the
land
allowed
this
way
the
time
passed
without
event
until
the
seventh
day
The
weather
was
still
grey
and
overcast
with
wind
from
the
East
but
evening
drew
into
night
the
sky
away
westward
cleared
and
pools
faint
light
yellow
and
pale
green
opened
under
the
grey
shores
cloud
There
the
white
rind
the
new
Moon
could
seen
glimmering
the
remote
lakes
Sam
looked
and
puckered
his
brows
The
next
day
the
country
either
side
began
change
rapidly
The
banks
began
rise
and
grow
stony
Soon
they
were
passing
through
hilly
rocky
land
and
both
shores
there
were
steep
slopes
buried
deep
brakes
thorn
and
sloe
tangled
with
brambles
and
creepers
Behind
them
stood
low
crumbling
cliffs
and
chimneys
grey
weathered
stone
dark
with
ivy
and
beyond
these
again
there
rose
high
ridges
crowned
with
wind
writhen
firs
They
were
drawing
near
the
grey
hill
country
the
Emyn
Muil
the
southern
march
Wilderland
There
were
many
birds
about
the
cliffs
and
the
rock
chimneys
and
all
day
high
the
air
flocks
birds
had
been
circling
black
against
the
pale
sky
they
lay
their
camp
that
day
Aragorn
watched
the
flights
doubtfully
wondering
Gollum
had
been
doing
some
mischief
and
the
news
their
voyage
was
now
moving
the
wilderness
Later
the
502
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
sun
was
setting
and
the
Company
was
stirring
and
getting
ready
start
again
descried
dark
spot
against
the
fading
light
great
bird
high
and
far
off
now
wheeling
now
flying
slowly
southwards
What
that
Legolas
asked
pointing
the
northern
sky
think
eagle
Yes
said
Legolas
eagle
hunting
eagle
wonder
what
that
forebodes
far
from
the
mountains
will
not
start
until
fully
dark
said
Aragorn
The
eighth
night
their
journey
came
was
silent
and
windless
the
grey
east
wind
had
passed
away
The
thin
cres
cent
the
Moon
had
fallen
early
into
the
pale
sunset
but
the
sky
was
clear
above
and
though
far
away
the
South
there
were
great
ranges
cloud
that
still
shone
faintly
the
West
stars
glinted
bright
Come
said
Aragorn
will
venture
one
more
journey
night
are
coming
reaches
the
River
that
not
know
well
for
have
never
journeyed
water
these
parts
before
not
between
here
and
the
rapids
Sarn
Gebir
But
right
reckoning
those
are
still
many
miles
ahead
Still
there
are
dangerous
places
even
before
come
there
rocks
and
stony
eyots
the
stream
must
keep
sharp
watch
and
not
try
paddle
swiftly
Sam
the
leading
boat
was
given
the
task
watch
man
lay
forward
peering
into
the
gloom
The
night
grew
dark
but
the
stars
above
were
strangely
bright
and
there
was
glimmer
the
face
the
River
was
close
midnight
and
they
had
been
drifting
for
some
while
hardly
using
the
paddles
when
suddenly
Sam
cried
out
Only
few
yards
ahead
dark
shapes
loomed
the
stream
and
heard
the
swirl
racing
water
There
was
swift
current
which
swung
left
towards
the
eastern
shore
where
the
channel
was
clear
they
were
swept
aside
the
travellers
could
see
now
very
close
the
pale
foam
the
River
lashing
against
sharp
rocks
that
were
thrust
out
far
into
the
stream
like
ridge
teeth
The
boats
were
all
huddled
together
THE
GREAT
RIVER
503
Hoy
there
Aragorn
shouted
Boromir
his
boat
bumped
into
the
leader
This
madness
cannot
dare
the
Rapids
night
But
boat
can
live
Sarn

night
day
Back
back
cried
Aragorn
Turn
Turn
you
can
drove
his
paddle
into
the
water
trying
hold
the
boat
and
bring
round
out
reckoning
said
Frodo
did
not
know
that
had
come
far
Anduin
flows
faster
than
thought
Sarn
Gebir
must
close
hand
already
With
great
efforts
they
checked
the
boats
and
slowly
brought
them
about
but
first
they
could
make
only
small
headway
against
the
current
and
all
the
time
they
were
carried
nearer
and
nearer
the
eastern
bank
Now
dark
and
ominous
loomed
the
night
All
together
paddle
shouted
Boromir
Paddle
shall
driven
the
shoals
Even
spoke
Frodo
felt
the
keel
beneath
him
grate
upon
stone
that
moment
there
was
twang
bowstrings
several
arrows
whistled
over
them
and
some
fell
among
them
One
smote
Frodo
between
the
shoulders
and
lurched
forward
with
cry
letting
his
paddle
but
the
arrow
fell
back
foiled
his
hidden
coat
mail
Another
passed
through
Aragorn
hood
and
third
stood
fast
the
gunwale
the
second
boat
close
Merry
hand
Sam
thought
could
glimpse
black
figures
running
and
fro
upon
the
long
shingle
banks
that
lay
under
the
eastern
shore
They
seemed
very
near
Yrch
said
Legolas
falling
into
his
own
tongue
Ores
cried
Gimli
Gollum
doing
bound
said
Sam
Frodo
And
nice
place
choose
too
The
River
seems
set
taking
right
into
their
arms
They
all
leaned
forward
straining
the
paddles
even
Sam
took
hand
Every
moment
they
expected
feel
the
bite
black
feathered
arrows
Many
whined
overhead

THE

water
nearby
but
there
were
more
hits
was
dark
but
not
too
dark
for
the
night
eyes
Ores
and
the
star
glimmer
they
must
have
offered
their
cunning
foes
some
mark
unless
was
that
the
grey
cloaks
Lorien
and
the
grey
timber
the
elf
wrought
boats
defeated
the
malice
the
archers
Mordor
Stroke
stroke
they
laboured
the
darkness
was
hard
sure
that
they
were
indeed
moving
all
but
slowly
the
swirl
the
water
grew
less
and
the
shadow
the
eastern
bank
faded
back
into
the
night
last
far
they
could
judge
they
had
reached
the
middle
the
stream
again
and
had
driven
their
boats
back
some
distance
above
the
jutting
rocks
Then
half
turning
they
thrust
them
with
all
their
strength
towards
the
western
shore
Under
the
shadow
bushes
leaning
out
over
the
water
they
halted
and
drew
breath
Legolas
laid
down
his
paddle
and
took
the
bow
that
had
brought
from
Lorien
Then
sprang
ashore
and
climbed
few
paces
the
bank
Stringing
the
bow
and
fitting
arrow
turned
peering
back
over
the
River
into
the
darkness
Across
the
water
there
were
shrill
cries
but
nothing
could
seen
Frodo
looked
the
Elf
standing
tall
above
him
gazed
into
the
night
seeking
mark
shoot
His
head
was
dark
crowned
with
sharp
white
stars
that
glittered
the
black
pools
the
sky
behind
But
now
rising
and
sailing
from
the
South
the
great
clouds
advanced
sending
out
dark
outriders
into
the
starry
fields
sudden
dread
fell
the
Company
Elbereth
Gilthonieir
sighed
Legolas
looked
Even
did
dark
shape
like
cloud
and
yet
not
cloud
for
moved
far
more
swiftly
came
out
the
blackness
the
South
and
sped
towards
the
Company
blotting
out
all
light
approached
Soon
appeared
great
winged
creature
blacker
than
the
pits
the
night
Fierce
voices
rose
greet
from
across
the
water
Frodo
felt
sudden
chill
running
through
him
and
clutching
his
heart
there
was
THE
GREAT
RIVER
505
deadly
cold
like
the
memory
old
wound
his
shoulder
crouched
down
hide
Suddenly
the
great
bow
Lorien
sang
Shrill
went
the
arrow
from
the
elven
string
Frodo
looked
Almost
above
him
the
winged
shape
swerved
There
was
harsh
croaking
scream
fell
out
the
air
vanishing
down
into
the
gloom
the
eastern
shore
The
sky
was
clean
again
There
was
tumult
many
voices
far
away
cursing
and
wailing
the
darkness
and
then
silence
Neither
shaft
nor
cry
came
again
from
the
east
that
night
After
while
Aragorn
led
the
boats
back
upstream
They
felt
their
way
along
the
water
edge
for
some
distance
until
they
found
small
shallow
bay
few
low
trees
grew
there
close
the
water
and
behind
them
rose
steep
rocky
hank
Here
the
Company
decided
stay
and
await
the
dawn
was
useless
attempt
move
further
night
They
made
camp
and
lit
fire
but
lay
huddled
the
boats
moored
close
together
Praised
the
bow
Galadriel
and
the
hand
and
eye
Legolas
said
Gimli
munched
wafer
lembas
That
was
mighty
shot
the
dark
friend
But
who
can
say
what
hit
said
Legolas
cannot
said
Gimli
But
glad
that
the
shadow
came
nearer
liked
not
all
Too
much
reminded
the
shadow
Moria
the
shadow
the
Balrog
ended
whisper
was
not
Balrog
said
Frodo
still
shivering
with
the
chill
that
had
come
upon
him
was
something
colder
think
was
Then
paused
and
fell
silent
What
you
think
asked
Boromir
eagerly
leaning
from
his
boat
was
trying
catch
glimpse
Frodo
face
think
will
not
say
answered
Frodo
Whatever
was
its
fall
has
dismayed
our
enemies
seems
said
Aragorn
Yet
where
they
are
and
how
many
and
what
they
will
next
not
know
This
night
must
all
sleepless
Dark
hides
now
But
what
506
the
fellowship
the
ring
the
day
will
show
who
can
tell
Have
your
weapons
close
hand
Sam
sat
tapping
the
hilt
his
sword
were
counting
his
fingers
and
looking
the
sky
very
strange
murmured
The
Moon
the
same
the
Shire
and
Wilderland
ought
But
either
out
its
running
all
wrong
reckoning
You
remember
Frodo
the
Moon
was
waning
lay
the
flet
that
tree
week
from
the
full
reckon
And
been
week
the
way
last
night
when
pops
New
Moon
thin
nail
paring
had
never
stayed
time
the
Elvish
country
Well
can
remember
three
nights
there
for
certain
and
seem
remember
several
more
but
would
take
oath
was
never
whole
month
Anyone
would
think
that
time
did
not
count
there
And
perhaps
that
was
the
way
said
Frodo
that
land
maybe
were
time
that
has
elsewhere
long
gone
was
not
think
until
Silverlode
bore
back
Anduin
that
returned
the
time
that
flows
through
mortal
lands
the
Great
Sea
And
don
remember
any
moon
either
new
old
Caras
Galadhon
only
stars
night
and
sun

Legolas
stirred
his
boat
Nay
time
does
not
tarry
ever
said
but
change
and
growth
not
all
things
and
places
alike
For
the
Elves
the
world
moves
and
moves
both
very
swift
and
very
slow
Swift
because
they
themselves
change
little
and
all
else
fleets
grief
them
Slow
because
they
need
not
count
the
running
years
not
for
themselves
The
passing
seasons
are
but
ripples
ever
repeated
the
long
long
stream
Yet
beneath
the
Sun
all
things
must
wear
end
last
But
the
wearing
slow
Lorien
said
Frodo
The
power
the
Lady
Rich
are
the
hours
though
short
they
seem
Caras
Galadhon
where
Galadriel
wields
the
Elven
ring
THE
GREAT
RIVER
507
That
should
not
have
been
said
outside
Lorien
not
even
said
Aragorn
Speak
more
But
Sam
that
land
you
lost
your
count
There
time
flowed
swiftly
for
the
Elves
The
old
moon
passed
and
new
moon
waxed
and
waned
the
world
outside
while
tarried
there
And
yestereve
new
moon
came
again
Winter
nearly
gone
Time
flows
spring
little
hope
The
night
passed
silently
voice
call
was
heard
again
across
the
water
The
travellers
huddled
their
boats
felt
the
changing
the
weather
The
air
grew
warm
and
very
still
under
the
great
moist
clouds
that
had
floated
from
the
South
and
the
distant
seas
The
rushing
the
River
over
the
rocks
the
rapids
seemed
grow
louder
and
closer
The
twigs
the
trees
above
them
began
drip
When
the
day
came
the
mood
the
world
about
them
had
become
soft
and
sad
Slowly
the
dawn
grew
pale
light
diffused
and
shadowless
There
was
mist
the
River
and
white
fog
swathed
the
shore
the
far
hank
could
not
seen
can
abide
fog
said
Sam
but
this
seems
lucky
one
Now
perhaps
can
get
away
without
those
cursed
goblins
seeing
Perhaps
said
Aragorn
But
will
hard
find
the
path
unless
the
fog
lifts
little
later
And
must
find
the
path
are
pass
Sarn
Gebir
and
come
the
Emyn
Muil
not
see
why
should
pass
the
Rapids
follow
the
River
any
further
said
Boromir
the
Emyn
Muil
lie
before
then
can
abandon
these
cockle
boats
and
strike

and
southward
until
come
the
Entwash
and
cross
into
own
land
can
are
malting
for
Minas
Tirith
said
Aragorn
but
that
not
yet
agreed
And
such
course
may
more
perilous
than
sounds
The
vale
Entwash
flat
and
fenny
and
fog
deadly
peril
there
for
those
foot

laden
would
not
abandon
our

the

But
the
Enemy

the
eastern

objected
Boromir
And
even
you
pass
the
Gates
Argonath
and
come
unmolested
the
Tindrock
what
will
you
then
Leap
down
the
Falls
and
land
the
marshes
answered
Aragorn
Say
rather
that
will
bear
our
boats
the
ancient
way
Rauros
foot
and
there
take
the
water
again
you
not
know
Boromir
you
choose
forget
the
North
Stair
and
the
high
seat
upon
Amon
Hen
that
were
made
the
days
the
great
kings
least
have
mind
stand
that
high
place
again
before
decide
further
course
There
maybe
shall
see
some
sign
that
will
guide
Boromir
held
out
long
against
this
choice
but
when
became
plain
that
Frodo
would
follow
Aragorn
wherever
went
gave
not
the
way
the
Men
Minas
Tirith
desert
their
friends
need
said
and
you
will
need
strength
ever
you
are
reach
the
Tindrock
the
tall
isle
will
but
further
There
shall
turn
home
alone
help
has
not
earned
the
reward
any
companionship
The
day
was
now
growing
and
the
fog
had
lifted
little
was
decided
that
Aragorn
and
Legolas
should
once
forward
along
the
shore
while
the
others
remained
the
boats
Aragorn
hoped
find
some
way
which
they
could
carry
both
their
boats
and
their
baggage
the
smoother
water
beyond
the
Rapids
Boats
the
Elves
would
not
sink
maybe
said
but
that
does
not
say
that
should
come
through

None

the
Men
Gondor

Boromir
you

Peril

ahead
every

road
answered
Aragorn
Wait
for
one
day
not
return
that
time
you
will
know
that
evil
has
indeed
befallen
Then
you
must
take
new
leader
and
follow
him
best
you
can
was
with
heavy
heart
that
Frodo
saw
Aragorn
and
Legolas
climb
the
steep
hank
and
vanish
into
the
mists
but
his
fears
proved
groundless
Only
two
three
hours
had
passed
and
was
barely
mid
day
when
the
shadowy
shapes
the
explorers
appeared
again
All
well
said
Aragorn
clambered
down
the
hank
There
track
and
leads
good
landing
that
still
serviceable
The
distance
not
great
the
head
the
Rapids
but
half
mile
below
and
they
are
little
more
than
mile
long
Not
far
beyond
them
the
stream
becomes
clear
and
smooth
again
though
runs
swiftly
Our
hardest
task
will
get
our
boats
and
baggage
the
old
portage
way
have
found
but
lies
well
back
from
the
water
side
here
and
runs
under
the

furlong

from
the
shore
did
not
find
where
the
northward
landing
lies
still
remains
must
have
passed
yesterday
night
might
labour
far
upstream
and
yet
miss
the
fog
fear
must
leave
the
River
now
and
make
for
the
portage
way
best
can
from
here
That
would
not
easy
even
were

Men

Boromir
Yet
such

Aragorn
Aye

Gimli

Master
Boromir
The
task
proved
hard
indeed
yet
the
end
was
done
The
goods
were
taken
out
the
boats
and
brought
the
top
the
bank
where
there
was
level
space
Then
the
boats
were
drawn
out
the

and
carried
They

far
less
heavy
than
any
had
expected
what
tree
growing
the
Elvish
country
they
were
made
not
even
Legolas
knew
but
the
wood
was
tough
and
yet
strangely
light
Merry
and
Pippin
alone
could
carry
their
boat
with
ease
along
the
flat
Nonetheless
needed
the
strength
the
two
Men
lift
and
haul
them
over
the
ground
that
the
Company
now
had
cross
sloped
away
from
the
River
tumbled
waste
grey
limestone
boulders
with
many
hidden
holes
shrouded
with
weeds
and
bushes
there
were
thickets
brambles
and
sheer
dells
and
here
and
there
boggy
pools
fed
waters
trickling
from
the
terraces
further
inland
One

Boromir
and
Aragorn
carried
the

while
the
others
toiled
and
scrambled
after
them
with
the
baggage
last
all
was
removed
and
laid
the
portage
way
Then
with
little
further
hindrance
save
from
sprawling
briars
and
many
fallen
stones
they
moved
forward
all
together
Fog
still
hung
veils
upon
the
crumbling
rock
wall
and
their
left
mist
shrouded
the
River
they
could
hear
rushing
and
foaming
over
the
sharp
shelves
and
stony
teeth
Sarn

but
they
could
not
see
Twice
they
made
the
journey
before
all
was
brought
safe
the
southern
landing
There
the
portage
way
turning
back
the
water
side
ran
gently
down
the
shallow
edge
little
pool
seemed
have
been
scooped
the

side
not

but
the
water
swirling
down
from
Sarn

against
low
pier
rock
that
jutted
out
some
way
into
the
stream
Beyond
the
shore
rose
sheer
into

cliff
and
there
was
further
passage
for
those

Already
the
short
afternoon
was
past
and
dim
cloudy
dusk
was
closing
They
sat
beside
the
water
listening
the
confused
rush
and

hidden
the

they
were
tired

sleepy

But

turns
three
hours
off
and
one
guard
Nothing
happened
that
night
worse
than
brief
drizzle
rain
hour
before
dawn
soon
was
fully
light
they
started
Already
the
fog
was
thinning
They
kept
close
they
could
the
western
side
and
they
could
see
the
dim
shapes
the
low
cliffs
rising
ever
higher
shadowy
walls
with
their
feet
the
hurrying
river
the
mid
morning
the
clouds
drew
down
lower
and
began
rain
heavily
They
drew
the
skin
covers
over
their
boats
prevent
them
from
being
flooded
and
drifted
little
could
seen
before
them
about
them
through
the
grey
falling
curtains
The
rain
however
did
not
last
long
Slowly
the
sky
above
grew
lighter
and
then
suddenly
the
clouds
broke
and
their
draggled
fringes
trailed
away
northward
the
River
The
fogs
and
mists
were
gone
Before
the
travellers
lay
wide
ravine
with
great
rocky
sides
which
clung
upon
shelves
and
narrow
crevices
few
thrawn
trees
The
channel
grew
narrower
and
the
River
swifter
Now
they
were
speeding
along
with
little
hope
stopping
turning
whatever
they
might
meet
ahead
Over
them
was
lane
pale
blue
sky
around
them
the
dark
overshadowed
River

before
them
black
shutting
out

the

Frodo
peering
forward
saw
the

seemed
Tall

ominous
they
stood
upon

Hold

Frodo
was
borne
towards
them
the
great
pillars
rose
like
towers
meet
him
Giants
they
seemed
him
vast
grey
figures
silent
but
threatening
Then
saw
that
they
were
indeed
shaped
and
fashioned
the
craft
and
power
old
had
wrought
upon
them
and
still
they
preserved
through
the
suns
and
rains
forgotten
years
the
mighty
likenesses
which
they
had
been
hewn
Upon
great
pedestals
founded
the
deep
waters
stood
two
great
kings
stone
still
with
blurred
eyes
and
crannied
brows
they
frowned
upon

North
The

was
raised

warning
each

there
was

upon

there
was

Great
power
and
majesty
they
still
wore
the
silent
wardens
long
vanished

Awe
and
fear
fell
upon
Frodo
and
cowered
down
shutting
his
eyes
and
not
daring
look
the
boat
drew
near
Even
Boromir
bowed
his

the

The

Frodo

eyes
faded
and
spoke
himself
Would
that
Gandalf
were
here
How
heart
yearns
for
Minas
Anor
and
the
walls
own
city
But
whither
now
shah
The
chasm
was
long
and
dark
and
filled
with
the
noise
wind
and
rushing
water
and
echoing
stone
bent
somewhat
towards
the
west
that
first
all
was
dark
ahead
but
soon
Frodo
saw
tall
gap
light
before
him
ever
growing
Swiftly
drew
near
and
suddenly
the
boats
shot
through
out
into
wide
clear
light
The
sun
already
long
fallen
from
the
noon
was
shining
windy
sky
The
pent
waters
spread
out
into
long
oval
lake
pale
Nen
Hithoel
fenced
steep
grey
hills
whose
sides
were
clad
with
trees
but
their
heads
were
bare
cold
gleaming
the
sunlight
the
far
southern
end
rose
three
peaks
The
midmost
stood
somewhat
forward
from
the
others
and
sundered
from
them
island
the
waters
about
which
the
flowing
River
flung
pale
shimmering
arms
Distant
but
deep
there
came
the
wind
roaring
sound
like
the
roll
thunder
heard
far
away
Behold
Tol
Brandir
said
Aragorn
pointing
south
the
tall
peak
Upon
the
left
stands
Amon
Lhaw
and
upon
the
right
Amon
Hen
the
Hills
Hearing
and
Sight
the
days
the
great
kings
there
were
high
seats
upon
them
and
watch
was
kept
there
But
said
that
foot
man
beast
has
ever
been
set
upon
Tol
Brandir
Ere
the
shade
night
falls
shall
come
them
hear
the
endless
voice
Rauros
calling
The
Company
rested
now
for
while
drifting
south
the
current
that
flowed
through
the
middle
the
lake
They
ate
some
food
and
then
they
took
their
paddles
and
hastened
their
way
The
sides
the
westward
hills
fell
into
shadow
and
the
Sun
grew
round
and
red
Here
and
there
misty
star
peered
out
The
three
peaks
loomed
before
them
darkling
the
twilight
Rauros
was
roaring
with
great

THE

the

Already
night
was
laid
the
flowing
waters
when
the
travellers
came
last
under
the
shadow
the
hills
The
tenth
day
their
journey
was
over
Wilderland
was
behind
them
They
could
further
without
choice
between
the
east
way
and
the
west
The
last

the
Quest
was
before
them

THE
BREAKING
THE

Aragorn
led
them
the
right
arm
the
River
Here
upon
its
western
side
under
the
shadow
Tol
Brandir
green
lawn
ran
down
the
water
from
the
feet
Amon
Hen
Behind
rose
the
first
gentle
slopes
the
hill
clad
with
trees
and
trees
marched
away
westward
along
the
curving
shores
the
lake
little
spring
fell
tumbling
down
and
fed
the
grass
Here
will
rest
tonight
said
Aragorn
This
the
lawn
Parth
Galen
fair
place
the
summer
days
old
Let
hope
that
evil
has
yet
come
here
They
drew
their
boats
the
green
banks
and
beside
them
they
made
their
camp
They
set
watch
but
had
sight
nor
sound
their
enemies
Gollum
had
conttived
follow
them
remained
unseen
and
unheard
Nonetheless
the
night
wore
Aragorn
grew
uneasy
tossing
often
his
sleep
and
waking
the
small
hours
got
and
came
Frodo
whose
turn
was
watch
Why
are
you
waking
asked
Frodo
not
your
watch
not
know
answered
Aragorn
but
shadow
and
threat
has
been
growing
sleep
would
well
draw
your
sword
Why
said
Frodo
Are
enemies

Let
see
what
Sting
may
show
answered
Aragorn
Frodo
then
drew
the
elf
blade
from
its
sheath
his
dis
may
the
edges
gleamed
dimly
the
night
Ores
said
Not
very
near
and
yet
too
near
seems
feared
much
said
Aragorn
But
maybe
they
are
not

side
the
River
The

faint
and
may
point
more
than

THE

THE

upon
Amon
Hen
Yet
who
knows
what
may
happen
these
evil
days
now
that
Minas
Tirith
longer
holds
secure
the
passages
Anduin
must
warily
tomorrow
The
day
came
like
fire
and
smoke
Low
the
East
there
were
black
bars
cloud
like
the
fumes
great
burning
The
rising
sun
lit
them
from
beneath
with
flames
murky
red
but
soon
climbed
above
them
into
clear
sky
The
summit
Tol
Brandir
was
tipped
with
gold
Frodo
looked
out
eastward
and
gazed
the
tall
island
Its
sides
sprang
sheer
out
the
running
water
High
above
the
tall
cliffs
were
steep
slopes
upon
which
trees
climbed
mounting
one
head
above
another
and
above
them
again
were
grey
faces
inaccessible
rock
crowned
great
spire
stone
Many
birds
were
circling
about
but
sign
other
living
things
could
seen
When
they
had
eaten
Aragorn
called
the
Company
together
The
day
has
come
last
said
the
day
choice
which
have
long
delayed
What
shall
now
become
our
Company
that
has
travelled
far
fellowship
Shall
turn
west
with
Boromir
and
the
wars
Gondor
turn
east
the
Fear
and
Shadow
shall
break
our
fellowship
and
this
way
and
that
each
may
choose
Whatever
must
done
soon
cannot
long
halt
here
The
enemy
the
eastern
shore
know
but
fear
that
the
Ores
may
already
this
side
the
water
There
was
long
silence
which
one
spoke
moved
Well
Frodo
said
Aragorn
last
fear
that
the
burden
laid
upon
you
You
are
the
Bearer
appointed
the
Coun
cil
Your
own
way
you
alone
can
choose
this
matter
cannot
advise
you
not
Gandalf
and
though
have
tried
bear
his
part
not
know
what
design
hope
had
for
this
hour
indeed
had
any
Most
likely
seems
that
were
here
now
the
choice
would
still
wait
you
Such
your
fate
Frodo
did
not
answer
once
Then
spoke
slowly
know
that
haste
needed
yet
cannot
choose
The

heavy
Give
hour
longer
and
will
speak
Let
alone
Aragorn
looked
him
with
kindly
pity
Very
well
Frodo
son
Drogo
said
You
shall
have
hour
and
you
shall
alone
will
stay
here
for
while
But
not
stray
far
out
call
Frodo
sat
for
moment
with
his
head
bowed
Sam
who
had
been
watching
his
master
with
great
concern
shook
his
head
and
muttered
Plain
pikestaff
but
good
Sam
Gamgee
putting
his
spoke
just
now
Presently
Frodo
got
and
walked
away
and
Sam
saw
that
while
the
others
restrained
themselves
and
did
not
stare
him
the
eyes
Boromir
followed
Frodo
intently
until
passed
out
sight
the
trees
the
foot
Amon
Hen
Wandering
aimlessly
first
the
wood
Frodo
found
that
his
feet
were
leading
him
towards
the
slopes
the
hill
came
path
the
dwindling
ruins
road
long
ago
steep
places
stairs
stone
had
been
hewn
but
now
they
were
cracked
and
worn
and
split
the
roots
trees
For
some
while
climbed
not
caring
which
way
went
until
came
grassy
place
Rowan
trees
grew
about
and
the
midst
was
wide
flat
stone
The
little
upland
lawn
was
open
upon
the
East
and
was
filled
now
with
the
early
sunlight
Frodo
halted
and
looked
out
over
the
River
far
below
him
Tol
Brandir
and
the
birds
wheeling
the
great
gulf
air
between
him
and
the
untrodden
isle
The
voice
Rauros
was
mighty
roaring
mingled
with
deep
throbbing
boom
sat
down
upon
the
stone
and
cupped
his
chin
his
hands
staring
eastwards
but
seeing
little
with
his
eyes
All
that
had
happened
since
Bilbo
left
the
Shire
was
passing
through
his
mind
and
recalled
and
pondered
everything
that
could
remember
Gandalf
words
Time
went
and
still
was
nearer
choice
Suddenly
awoke
from
his
thoughts
strange
feeling
came
him
that
something
was
behind
him
that
unfriendly
eyes
were
upon
him
sprang
and
turned
but
all
that
THE
FELLOWSHIP
THE
RING
saw
his
surprise
was
Boromir
and
his
face
was
smiling
and
kind
was
afraid
for
you
Frodo
said
coming
forward
Aragorn
right
and
Ores
are
near
then
none
should
wander
alone
and
you
least
all
much
depends
you
And
heart
too
heavy
May
stay
now
and
talk
for
while
since
have
found
you
would
comfort
Where
there
are
many
all
speech
becomes
debate
without
end
But
two
together
may
perhaps
find
wisdom
You
are
kind
answered
Frodo
But
not
think
that
any
speech
will
help
For
know
what
should
but
afraid
doing
Boromir
afraid
Boromir
stood
silent
Rauros
roared
endlessly
The
wind
murmured
the
branches
the
trees
Frodo
shivered
Suddenly
Boromir
came
and
sat
beside
him
Are
you
sure
that
you
not
suffer
needlessly
said
wish
help
you
need
counsel
your
hard
choice
Will
you
not
take
mine
think
know
already
what
counsel
you
would
give
Boromir
said
Frodo
And
would
seem
like
wisdom
but
for
the
warning
heart
Warning
Warning
against
what
said
Boromir
sharply
Against
delay
Against
the
way
that
seems
easier
Against
refusal
the
burden
that
laid
Against
well
must
said
against
trust
the
strength
and
truth
Men
Yet
that
strength
has
long
protected
you
far
away
your
little
country
though
you
knew
not
not
doubt
the
valour
your
people
But
the
world
changing
The
walls
Minas
Tirith
may
strong
but
they
are
not
strong
enough
they
fail
what
then
shall
fall
battle
valiantly
Yet
there
still
hope
that
they
will
not
fail
hope
while
the
Ring
lasts
said
Frodo
The
Ring
said
Boromir
his
eyes
lighting
The
Ring
not
strange
fate
that
should
suffer
much
fear
and
doubt
for
small
thing
small

And
have

only
for
instant

Could

Frodo
looked
His
heart
went
suddenly
cold
caught
the
strange
gleam
Boromir
eyes
yet
his
face
was
still
kind
and
friendly
best
that
should
lie
hidden
answered
you
wish
care
not
said
Boromir
Yet
may
not
even
speak
For
you
seem
ever
think
only
its
power
the
hands
the
Enemy
its
evil
uses
not
its
good
The
world
changing
you
say
Minas
Tirith
will
fall
the
Ring
lasts
But
why
Certainly
the
Ring
were
with
the
Enemy
But
why
were
with
Were
you
not
the
Council
answered
Frodo
Because

Boromir

Gandalf

These

perhaps
Yet

they

and
not

But

Boromir

How

all

Boromir
strode
and
down
speaking
ever
more
loudly
Almost
seemed
have
forgotten
Frodo
while
his
talk
dwelt
walls
and
weapons
and
the
mustering
men
and
drew
plans
for
great
alliances
and
glorious
victories
and
cast
down
Mordor
and
became
himself
mighty

benevolent
and

Suddenly

Surely

Frodo

You

Simply

Boromir
His

but
Frodo
felt
the

trembling
with
suppressed
excitement
stepped
quickly
away
and
eyed
with
alarm
the
tall
Man
nearly
twice
his
height
and
many
times
his

strength
Why
are
you

said
Boromir

neither

Frodo
The

THE

Frodo
did
not
answer
but
moved
away
till
the
great
flat
stone
stood
between
them
Come
come
friend
said
Boromir
softer
voice
Why
not
get
rid
Why
not
free
your
doubt
and
fear
You
can
lay
the
blame
you
will
You
can
say
that
was
too
strong
and
took
force
For
too
strong
for
you
halfling
cried
and
suddenly
sprang
over
the
stone
and
leaped
Frodo
His
fair
and
pleasant
face
was
hideously
changed
raging
fire
was
his
eyes
Frodo
dodged
aside
and
again
put
the
stone
between
them
There
was
only
one
thing
could
trembling
pulled
out
the
Ring
upon
its
chain
and
quickly
slipped
his
finger
even
Boromir
sprang
him
again
The
Man
gasped
stared
for
moment
amazed
and
then
ran
wildly
about
seeking
here
and
there
among
the
rocks
and
trees
Miserable
trickster
shouted
Let
get
hands
you
Now
see
your
mind
You
will
take
the
Ring
Sauron
and
sell
all
You
have
only
waited
your
chance
leave
the
lurch
Curse
you
and
all
halflings
death
and
dark
ness
Then
catching
his
foot
stone
fell
sprawling
and
lay
upon
his
face
For
while
was
still
his
own
curse
had
struck
him
down
then
suddenly
wept
rose
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
dashing
away
the
tears
What
have
said

What
have
done
Frodo
Frodo
called
Come

madness
took
but

Come

There

Frodo
did
not
even
hear
his
cries
was
already
far
away
leaping
blindly
the
path
the
hill

Terror
and
grief
shook
him
seeing
his
thought
the
mad
fierce
face
Boromir
and
his
burning
eyes
Soon
came
out
alone
the
summit
Amon
Hen
and
halted
gasping
for
breath
saw
through
mist
wide

with

with

world
mist
which
there
were
only
shadows
the

was
upon
him
Then
here
and
there
the
mist
gave
way
and
saw
many
visions
small
and
clear
they
were
under
his
eyes
upon
table
and
yet
remote
There
was
sound
only
bright
living
images
The
world
seemed
have
shrunk
and
fallen
silent
was
sitting
upon
the

Seeing
Amon
Hen
the

the

the

Numenor
Eastward
looked
into
wide
uncharted
lands
nameless
plains
and
forests
unexplored
Northward
looked
and
the
Great
River
lay
like
ribbon
beneath
him
and
the
Misty
Mountains
stood
small
and
hard
broken
teeth
Westward
looked
and
saw
the
broad
pastures
Rohan
and
Orthanc
the
pinnacle
Isengard
like
black
spike
Southward
looked
and
below
his
very

the

curled
like
toppling
wave
and
plunged
over
the
falls
Rauros
into
foaming
pit
glimmering
rainbow
played
upon
the
fume
And
Ethir
Anduin
saw
the
mighty

the

and
myriads

birds
whirling
like
white
dust
the
sun
and
beneath
them
green
and
silver

rippling
endless

But
everywhere
looked
saw
the

The

holes
Under
the
boughs
Mirkwood
there
was
deadly
strife
Elves
and
Men
and
fell
beasts
The
land
the

was
aflame
cloud
was
over
Moria
smoke

Horsemen

All

Then
turning
south

beheld

battlements
glittered
with
steel
and
its
turrets
were
bright
with
many
banners
Hope
leaped
his
heart
But
against
Minas
Tirith
was
set
another
fortress
greater
and
more
strong
Thither
eastward
unwilling
his
eye
was
drawn
passed
the
ruined
bridges
Osgiliath
the
grinning
gates
Minas

and
the
haunted

and
looked
upon

Mordor
Dark

lay
there
under

Sun
Fire
glowed
amid

Mount

was
burning
and

rising
Then
last
his
gaze
was

All

left
him
And
suddenly
felt
the
Eye
There
was
eye
the
Dark
Tower
that
did
not
sleep
knew
that
had
become
aware
his
gaze
fierce
eager
will
was
there
leaped
towards
him
almost
like
finger
felt
searching
for
him
Very
soon
would
nail
him
down
know
just
exactly
where
was
Amon
Lhaw
touched
glanced
upon
Tol
Brandir
threw
himself
from
the
seat
crouching
covering
his
head
with
his
grey
hood
heard
himself
crying
out
Never
never
was
Verily
come
come
you
could
not
tell
Then
flash
from
some
other
point
power
there
came
his
mind
another
thought
Take
off
Take
off
Fool
take
off
Take
off
the
Ring
The
two
powers
strove
him
For
moment
perfectly
balanced
between
their
piercing
points
writhed
tor
mented
Suddenly
was
aware
himself
again
Frodo
neither
the
Voice
nor
the
Eye
free
choose
and
with
one
remaining
instant
which
took
the
Ring
off
his
finger
was
kneeling
clear
sunlight
before
the
high
seat
black
shadow
seemed
pass
like
arm
above
him
missed
Amon
Hen
and
groped
out
west
and
faded
Then
all
the
sky
was
clean
and
blue
and
birds
sang
every
tree
Frodo
rose
his
feet
great
weariness
was
him
but
his
will
was
firm
and
his
heart
lighter
spoke
aloud

This

once
went
quickly
down
the
path
and
came
back
the
lawn
where
Boromir
had
found
him
Then
halted
listening
thought
could
hear
cries
and
calls
from
the
woods
near
the
shore
below
They
hunting

wonder
how

Hours

What

never

hate

and
like
this
without
any

But
surely
they
will
understand
Sam
will
And
what
else
can
Slowly
drew
out
the
Ring
and
put

and
passed
down
the

less
than
rustle

The
others
remained
long
the
river
side
For
some
time
they
had
been
silent
moving
restlessly
about
but
now
they
were
sitting
circle
and
they
were
talking
Every
now
and
again
they
made
efforts
speak
other
things
their
long
road
and
many
adventures
they
questioned
Aragorn
concerning
the
realm
Gondor
and
its
ancient
history
and
the
remnants
its
great
works
that
could

But
always
their
thoughts
and
words
strayed
back
Frodo
and
the

What
would
Frodo
choose
Why
was
hesitating
debating
which
course
the
most

Aragorn
And

The

Boromir

came

from

without

His

looked
grim
and
sad
paused
counting
those
that
were

and
then
sat
down
aloof
with
his

the
ground
Where
have
you
been
Boromir
asked
Aragorn
Have
you
seen

for

the

Boromir

They

Sam

Merry

Legolas

after

even
you

Come

this

Aragorn
sprang
swiftly
away
and
went
pursuit
Sam
Just
reached
the

lawn
among
the

Sam
did
his
best
but
could
not
keep
with
Strider
the
Ranger
and
soon
fell
behind
had
not
gone
far
before
Aragorn
was
out

ahead
Sam
stopped
and
puffed
Suddenly
clapped
his
hand
his
head
Whoa
Sam
Gamgee
said
aloud
Your
legs

use
your

Let
see
now
Boromir
isn

that
not

but
hasn
told

Frodo

There

the

but
did
not

them
stood
gazing
for
moment
stock
still
gaping
boat
was
sliding
down
the
bank
all
itself
With
shout
Sam
raced
across
the
grass
The

slipped
into
the
water
Coming
Frodo
Coming
called
Sam
and
flung
him
self
from
the
bank
clutching
the
departing
boat
missed
yard
With
cry
and
splash
fell
face
downward
into
deep
swift
water
Gurgling
went
under
and
the
River
closed
over
his
curly
head
exclamation
dismay
came
from
the

swirled
and
the

Sam
the

came
bubbling
and

Fear

There
now
get

and
let
use

With
few
strokes
Frodo
brought
the

back
the
bank
and
Sam
was
able
scramble
out

Frodo
took
off
the
Ring
and
stepped
ashore
again
all
the

Safely
said
Sam
All
alone
and
without
help
you
couldn
have
borne
have
been
the
death
would
the
death
you
come
with
Sam
said
Frodo
and
could
not
have
borne
that
Not
certain
being
left
behind
said
Sam
But
going
Mordor
know
that
well
enough
Frodo
course
you
are
And
coming
with
you
Now
Sam
said
Frodo
don
hinder
The
others
will
coming
back
any
minute
they
catch
here
shall
have
argue
and
explain
and
shall
never
have
the
heart
the
chance
get
off
But
must
once
the
only
way
course
answered
Sam
But
not
alone
coming
too
neither
isn
going
knock
holes
all
the
boats
first
Frodo
actually
laughed
sudden
warmth
and
gladness
touched
his
heart
Leave

said
need
But
you
can
come
like
this
without
your
gear
food
anything
Just
hold
moment
and
get

cried
Sam
eagerly
all
ready
thought
should
off
today
rushed
the
camping
place
fished
out
his
pack
from
the
pile
where
Frodo
had
laid
when
emptied
the

his
companions
goods
grabbed
spare
blanket
and
some
extra
packages
food
and
ran
back
all
plan
spoilt
said
Frodo
good
trying
escape
you
But
glad
Sam
cannot
tell
you
how
glad
Come
along

that

Strider

Yet

said
Sam
Frodo
and
Sam
set
off
the
last
stage
the
Quest
together
Frodo
paddled
away
from
the

and
the

THE

bore
them
swiftly
away
down
the
western
arm
and
past
the
frowning
cliffs
Tol
Brandir
The
roar
the
great
falls
drew
nearer
Even
with
such
help
Sam
could
give
was
hard
work
pass
across
the
current
the
southward
end
the
island
and
drive
the
boat
eastward
towards
the
far
shore
length
they
came
land
again
upon
the
southern
slopes
Amon
Lhaw
There
they
found
shelving
shore
and
they
drew
the
boat
out
high
above
the
water
and
hid
well
they
could
behind
great
boulder
Then
shouldering
their
burdens
they
set
off
seeking
path
that
would
bring
them
over
the
grey
hills
the
Emyn
Muil
and
down
into
the
Land
Shadow
