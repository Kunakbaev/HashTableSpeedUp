Harry
Potter
and
the
Sorcerer
Stone
CHAPTER
ONE
THE
BOY
WHO
LIVED
and
Mrs
Dursley
number
four
Privet
Drive
were
proud
say
that
they
were
perfectly
normal
thank
you
very
much
They
were
the
last
people
you
expect
involved
anything
strange
mysterious
because
they
just
didn
hold
with
such
nonsense
Dursley
was
the
director
firm
called
Grunnings
which
made
drills
was
big
beefy
man
with
hardly
any
neck
although
did
have
very
large
mustache
Mrs
Dursley
was
thin
and
blonde
and
had
nearly
twice
the
usual
amount
neck
which
came
very
useful
she
spent
much
her
time
craning
over
garden
fences
spying
the
neighbors
The
Dursleys
had
small
son
called
Dudley
and
their
opinion
there
was
finer
boy
anywhere
The
Dursleys
had
everything
they
wanted
but
they
also
had
secret
and
their
greatest
fear
was
that
somebody
would
discover
They
didn
think
they
could
bear
anyone
found
out
about
the
Potters
Mrs
Potter
was
Mrs
Dursley
sister
but
they
hadn
met
for
several
years
fact
Mrs
Dursley
pretended
she
didn
have
sister
because
her
sister
and
her
good
for
nothing
husband
were
unDursleyish
was
possible
The
Dursleys
shuddered
think
what
the
neighbors
would
say
the
Potters
arrived
the
street
The
Dursleys
knew
that
the
Potters
had
small
son
too
but
they
had
never
even
seen
him
This
boy
was
another
good
reason
for
keeping
the
Potters
away
they
didn
want
Dudley
mixing
with
child
like
that
When
and
Mrs
Dursley
woke
the
dull
gray
Tuesday
our
story
starts
there
was
nothing
about
the
cloudy
sky
outside
suggest
that
strange
and
mysterious
things
would
soon
happening
all
over
the
country
Dursley
hummed
picked
out
his
most
boring
tie
for
work
and
Mrs
Dursley
gossiped
away
happily
she
wrestled
screaming
Dudley
into
his
high
chair
None
them
noticed
large
tawny
owl
flutter
past
the
window
half
past
eight
Dursley
picked
his
briefcase
pecked
Mrs
Dursley
the
cheek
and
tried
kiss
Dudley
good
bye
but
missed
because
Dudley
was
now
having
tantrum
and
throwing
his
cereal
the
walls
Little
tyke
chortled
Dursley
left
the
house
got
into
his
car
and
backed
out
number
four
drive
was
the
corner
the
street
that
noticed
the
first
sign
something
peculiar
cat
reading
map
For
second
Dursley
didn
realize
what
had
seen
then
jerked
his
head
around
look
again
There
was
tabby
cat
standing
the
corner
Privet
Drive
but
there
wasn
map
sight
What
could
have
been
thinking
must
have
been
trick
the
light
Dursley
blinked
and
stared
the
cat
stared
back
Dursley
drove
around
the
corner
and
the
road
watched
the
cat
his
mirror
was
now
reading
the
sign
that
said
Privet
Drive
looking
the
sign
cats
couldn
read
maps
signs
Dursley
gave
himself
little
shake
and
put
the
cat
out
his
mind
drove
toward
town
thought
nothing
except
large
order
drills
was
hoping
get
that
day
But
the
edge
town
drills
were
driven
out
his
mind
something
else
sat
the
usual
morning
traffic
jam
couldn
help
noticing
that
there
seemed
lot
strangely
dressed
people
about
People
cloaks
Dursley
couldn
bear
people
who
dressed
funny
clothes
the
getups
you
saw
young
people
supposed
this
was
some
stupid
new
fashion
drummed
his
fingers
the
steering
wheel
and
his
eyes
fell
huddle
these
weirdos
standing
quite
close
They
were
whispering
excitedly
together
Dursley
was
enraged
see
that
couple
them
weren
young
all
why
that
man
had
older
than
was
and
wearing
emerald
green
cloak
The
nerve
him
But
then
struck
Dursley
that
this
was
probably
some
silly
stunt
these
people
were
obviously
collecting
for
something
yes
that
would
The
traffic
moved
and
few
minutes
later
Dursley
arrived
the
Grunnings
parking
lot
his
mind
back
drills
Dursley
always
sat
with
his
back
the
window
his
office
the
ninth
floor
hadn
might
have
found
harder
concentrate
drills
that
morning
didn
see
the
owls
swoop
ing
past
broad
daylight
though
people
down
the
street
did
they
pointed
and
gazed
open
mouthed
owl
after
owl
sped
overhead
Most
them
had
never
seen
owl
even
nighttime
Dursley
however
had
perfectly
normal
owl
free
morning
yelled
five
different
people
made
several
important
telephone
calls
and
shouted
bit
more
was
very
good
mood
until
lunchtime
when
thought
stretch
his
legs
and
walk
across
the
road
buy
himself
bun
from
the
bakery
forgotten
all
about
the
people
cloaks
until
passed
group
them
next
the
baker
eyed
them
angrily
passed
didn
know
why
but
they
made
him
uneasy
This
bunch
were
whispering
excitedly
too
and
couldn
see
single
collecting
tin
was
his
way
back
past
them
clutching
large
doughnut
bag
that
caught
few
words
what
they
were
saying
The
Potters
that
right
that
what
heard
yes
their
son
Harry
Dursley
stopped
dead
Fear
flooded
him
looked
back
the
whisperers
wanted
say
something
them
but
thought
better
dashed
back
across
the
road
hurried
his
office
snapped
his
secretary
not
disturb
him
seized
his
telephone
and
had
almost
finished
dialing
his
home
number
when
changed
his
mind
put
the
receiver
back
down
and
stroked
his
mustache
thinking
was
being
stupid
Potter
wasn
such
unusual
name
was
sure
there
were
lots
people
called
Potter
who
had
son
called
Harry
Come
think
wasn
even
sure
his
nephew
was
called
Harry
never
even
seen
the
boy
might
have
been
Harvey
Harold
There
was
point
worrying
Mrs
Dursley
she
always
got
upset
any
mention
her
sister
didn
blame
her
had
sister
like
that
but
all
the
same
those
people
cloaks
found
lot
harder
concentrate
drills
that
afternoon
and
when
left
the
building
five
clock
was
still
worried
that
walked
straight
into
someone
just
outside
the
door
Sorry
grunted
the
tiny
old
man
stumbled
and
almost
fell
was
few
seconds
before
Dursley
realized
that
the
man
was
wearing
violet
cloak
didn
seem
all
upset
being
almost
knocked
the
ground
the
contrary
his
face
split
into
wide
smile
and
said
squeaky
voice
that
made
passersby
stare
Don
sorry
dear
sir
for
nothing
could
upset
today
Rejoice
for
You
Know
Who
has
gone
last
Even
Muggles
like
yourself
should
celebrating
this
happy
happy
day
And
the
old
man
hugged
Dursley
around
the
middle
and
walked
off
Dursley
stood
rooted
the
spot
had
been
hugged
complete
stranger
also
thought
had
been
called
Muggle
whatever
that
was
was
rattled
hurried
his
car
and
set
off
for
home
hoping
was
imagining
things
which
had
never
hoped
before
because
didn
approve
imagination
pulled
into
the
driveway
number
four
the
first
thing
saw
and
didn
improve
his
mood
was
the
tabby
cat
spotted
that
morning
was
now
sitting
his
garden
wall
was
sure
was
the
same
one
had
the
same
markings
around
its
eyes
Shoo
said
Dursley
loudly
The
cat
didn
move
just
gave
him
stern
look
Was
this
normal
cat
behavior
Dursley
wondered
Trying
pull
himself
together
let
himself
into
the
house
was
still
determined
not
mention
anything
his
wife
Mrs
Dursley
had
had
nice
normal
day
She
told
him
over
dinner
all
about
Mrs
Next
Door
problems
with
her
daughter
and
how
Dudley
had
learned
new
word
Won
Dursley
tried
act
normally
When
Dudley
had
been
put
bed
went
into
the
living
room
time
catch
the
last
report
the
evening
news
And
finally
bird
watchers
everywhere
have
reported
that
the
nation
owls
have
been
behaving
very
unusually
today
Although
owls
normally
hunt
night
and
are
hardly
ever
seen
daylight
there
have
been
hundreds
sightings
these
birds
flying
every
direction
since
sunrise
Experts
are
unable
explain
why
the
owls
have
suddenly
changed
their
sleeping
pattern
The
newscaster
allowed
himself
grin
Most
mysterious
And
now
over
Jim
McGuffin
with
the
weather
Going
any
more
showers
owls
tonight
Jim
Well
Ted
said
the
weatherman
don
know
about
that
but
not
only
the
owls
that
have
been
acting
oddly
today
Viewers
far
apart
Kent
Yorkshire
and
Dundee
have
been
phoning
tell
that
instead
the
rain
promised
yesterday
they
had
downpour
shooting
stars
Perhaps
people
have
been
celebrating
Bonfire
Night
early
not
until
next
week
folks
But
can
promise
wet
night
tonight
Dursley
sat
frozen
his
armchair
Shooting
stars
all
over
Britain
Owls
flying
daylight
Mysterious
people
cloaks
all
over
the
place
And
whisper
whisper
about
the
Potters
Mrs
Dursley
came
into
the
living
room
carrying
two
cups
tea
was
good
have
say
something
her
cleared
his
throat
nervously
Petunia
dear
you
haven
heard
from
your
sister
lately
have
you
had
expected
Mrs
Dursley
looked
shocked
and
angry
After
all
they
normally
pretended
she
didn
have
sister
she
said
sharply
Why
Funny
stuff
the
news
Dursley
mumbled
Owls
shooting
stars
and
there
were
lot
funny
looking
people
town
today
snapped
Mrs
Dursley
Well
just
thought
maybe
was
something
with
you
know
her
crowd
Mrs
Dursley
sipped
her
tea
through
pursed
lips
Dursley
wondered
whether
dared
tell
her
heard
the
name
Potter
decided
didn
dare
Instead
said
casually
could
Their
son
about
Dudley
age
now
wouldn
suppose
said
Mrs
Dursley
stiffly
What
his
name
again
Howard
isn
Harry
Nasty
common
name
you
ask
yes
said
Dursley
his
heart
sinking
horribly
Yes
quite
agree
didn
say
another
word
the
subject
they
went
upstairs
bed
While
Mrs
Dursley
was
the
bathroom
Dursley
crept
the
bedroom
window
and
peered
down
into
the
front
garden
The
cat
was
still
there
was
staring
down
Privet
Drive
though
were
waiting
for
something
Was
imagining
things
Could
all
this
have
anything
with
the
Potters
did
got
out
that
they
were
related
pair
well
didn
think
could
bear
The
Dursleys
got
into
bed
Mrs
Dursley
fell
asleep
quickly
but
Dursley
lay
awake
turning
all
over
his
mind
His
last
comforting
thought
before
fell
asleep
was
that
even
the
Potters
were
involved
there
was
reason
for
them
come
near
him
and
Mrs
Dursley
The
Potters
knew
very
well
what
and
Petunia
thought
about
them
and
their
kind
couldn
see
how
and
Petunia
could
get
mixed
anything
that
might
going
yawned
and
turned
over
couldn
affect
them
How
very
wrong
was
Dursley
might
have
been
drifting
into
uneasy
sleep
but
the
cat
the
wall
outside
was
showing
sign
sleepiness
was
sitting
still
statue
its
eyes
fixed
unblinkingly
the
far
corner
Privet
Drive
didn
much
quiver
when
car
door
slammed
the
next
street
nor
when
two
owls
swooped
overhead
fact
was
nearly
midnight
before
the
cat
moved
all
man
appeared
the
corner
the
cat
had
been
watching
appeared
suddenly
and
silently
you
have
thought
just
popped
out
the
ground
The
cat
tail
twitched
and
its
eyes
narrowed
Nothing
like
this
man
had
ever
been
seen
Privet
Drive
was
tall
thin
and
very
old
judging
the
silver
his
hair
and
beard
which
were
both
long
enough
tuck
into
his
belt
was
wearing
long
robes
purple
cloak
that
swept
the
ground
and
high
heeled
buckled
boots
His
blue
eyes
were
light
bright
and
sparkling
behind
half
moon
spectacles
and
his
nose
was
very
long
and
crooked
though
had
been
broken
least
twice
This
man
name
was
Albus
Dumbledore
Albus
Dumbledore
didn
seem
realize
that
had
just
arrived
street
where
everything
from
his
name
his
boots
was
unwelcome
was
busy
rummaging
his
cloak
looking
for
something
But
did
seem
realize
was
being
watched
because
looked
suddenly
the
cat
which
was
still
staring
him
from
the
other
end
the
street
For
some
reason
the
sight
the
cat
seemed
amuse
him
chuckled
and
muttered
should
have
known
found
what
was
looking
for
his
inside
pocket
seemed
silver
cigarette
lighter
flicked
open
held
the
air
and
clicked
The
nearest
street
lamp
went
out
with
little
pop
clicked
again
the
next
lamp
flickered
into
darkness
Twelve
times
clicked
the
Put
Outer
until
the
only
lights
left
the
whole
street
were
two
tiny
pinpricks
the
distance
which
were
the
eyes
the
cat
watching
him
anyone
looked
out
their
window
now
even
beady
eyed
Mrs
Dursley
they
wouldn
able
see
anything
that
was
happening
down
the
pavement
Dumbledore
slipped
the
Put
Outer
back
inside
his
cloak
and
set
off
down
the
street
toward
number
four
where
sat
down
the
wall
next
the
cat
didn
look
but
after
moment
spoke
Fancy
seeing
you
here
Professor
McGonagall
turned
smile
the
tabby
but
had
gone
Instead
was
smiling
rather
severe
looking
woman
who
was
wearing
square
glasses
exactly
the
shape
the
markings
the
cat
had
had
around
its
eyes
She
too
was
wearing
cloak
emerald
one
Her
black
hair
was
drawn
into
tight
bun
She
looked
distinctly
ruffled
How
did
you
know
was
she
asked
dear
Professor
never
seen
cat
sit
stiffly
You
stiff
you
been
sitting
brick
wall
all
day
said
Professor
McGonagall
All
day
When
you
could
have
been
celebrating
must
have
passed
dozen
feasts
and
parties
way
here
Professor
McGonagall
sniffed
angrily
yes
everyone
celebrating
all
right
she
said
impatiently
You
think
they
bit
more
careful
but
even
the
Muggles
have
noticed
something
going
was
their
news
She
jerked
her
head
back
the
Dursleys
dark
living
room
window
heard
Flocks
owls
shooting
stars
Well
they
not
completely
stupid
They
were
bound
notice
something
Shooting
stars
down
Kent
bet
that
was
Dedalus
Diggle
never
had
much
sense
You
can
blame
them
said
Dumbledore
gently
had
precious
little
celebrate
for
eleven
years
know
that
said
Professor
McGonagall
irritably
But
that
reason
lose
our
heads
People
are
being
downright
careless
out
the
streets
broad
daylight
not
even
dressed
Muggle
clothes
swapping
rumors
She
threw
sharp
sideways
glance
Dumbledore
here
though
hoping
was
going
tell
her
something
but
didn
she
went
fine
thing
would
the
very
day
YouKnow
Who
seems
have
disappeared
last
the
Muggles
found
out
about
all
suppose
really
has
gone
Dumbledore
certainly
seems
said
Dumbledore
have
much
thankful
for
Would
you
care
for
lemon
drop
what
lemon
drop
They
kind
Muggle
sweet
rather
fond
thank
you
said
Professor
McGonagall
coldly
though
she
didn
think
this
was
the
moment
for
lemon
drops
say
even
You
Know
Who
has
gone
dear
Professor
surely
sensible
person
like
yourself
can
call
him
his
name
All
this
You
Know
Who
nonsense
for
eleven
years
have
been
trying
persuade
people
call
him
his
proper
name
Voldemort
Professor
McGonagall
flinched
but
Dumbledore
who
was
unsticking
two
lemon
drops
seemed
not
notice
all
gets
confusing
keep
saying
You
Know
Who
have
never
seen
any
reason
frightened
saying
Voldemort
name
know
you
haven
said
Professor
McGonagall
sounding
half
exasperated
half
admiring
But
you
different
Everyone
knows
you
the
only
one
You
Know
all
right
Voldemort
was
frightened
You
flatter
said
Dumbledore
calmly
Voldemort
had
powers
will
never
have
Only
because
you
too
well
noble
use
them
lucky
dark
haven
blushed
much
since
Madam
Pomfrey
told
she
liked
new
earmuffs
Professor
McGonagall
shot
sharp
look
Dumbledore
and
said
The
owls
are
nothing
next
the
rumors
that
are
flying
around
You
know
what
everyone
saying
About
why
disappeared
About
what
finally
stopped
him
seemed
that
Professor
McGonagall
had
reached
the
point
she
was
most
anxious
discuss
the
real
reason
she
had
been
waiting
cold
hard
wall
all
day
for
neither
cat
nor
woman
had
she
fixed
Dumbledore
with
such
piercing
stare
she
did
now
was
plain
that
whatever
everyone
was
saying
she
was
not
going
believe
until
Dumbledore
told
her
was
true
Dumbledore
however
was
choosing
another
lemon
drop
and
did
not
answer
What
they
saying
she
pressed
that
last
night
Voldemort
turned
Godric
Hollow
went
find
the
Potters
The
rumor
that
Lily
and
James
Potter
are
are
that
they
dead
Dumbledore
bowed
his
head
Professor
McGonagall
gasped
Lily
and
James
can
believe
didn
want
believe
Albus
Dumbledore
reached
out
and
patted
her
the
shoulder
know
know
said
heavily
Professor
McGonagall
voice
trembled
she
went
That
not
all
They
saying
tried
kill
the
Potter
son
Harry
But
couldn
couldn
kill
that
little
boy
one
knows
why
how
but
they
saying
that
when
couldn
kill
Harry
Potter
Voldemort
power
somehow
broke
and
that
why
gone
Dumbledore
nodded
glumly
true
faltered
Professor
McGonagall
After
all
done
all
the
people
killed
couldn
kill
little
boy
just
astounding
all
the
things
stop
him
but
how
the
name
heaven
did
Harry
survive
can
only
guess
said
Dumbledore
may
never
know
Professor
McGonagall
pulled
out
lace
handkerchief
and
dabbed
her
eyes
beneath
her
spectacles
Dumbledore
gave
great
sniff
took
golden
watch
from
his
pocket
and
examined
was
very
odd
watch
had
twelve
hands
but
numbers
instead
little
planets
were
moving
around
the
edge
must
have
made
sense
Dumbledore
though
because
put
back
his
pocket
and
said
Hagrid
late
suppose
was
who
told
you
here
the
way
Yes
said
Professor
McGonagall
And
don
suppose
you
going
tell
why
you
here
all
places
come
bring
Harry
his
aunt
and
uncle
They
the
only
family
has
left
now
You
don
mean
you
can
mean
the
people
who
live
here
cried
Professor
McGonagall
jumping
her
feet
and
pointing
number
four
Dumbledore
you
can
been
watching
them
all
day
You
couldn
find
two
people
who
are
less
like
And
they
got
this
son
saw
him
kicking
his
mother
all
the
way
the
street
screaming
for
sweets
Harry
Potter
come
and
live
here
the
best
place
for
him
said
Dumbledore
firmly
His
aunt
and
uncle
will
able
explain
everything
him
when
older
written
them
letter
letter
repeated
Professor
McGonagall
faintly
sitting
back
down
the
wall
Really
Dumbledore
you
think
you
can
explain
all
this
letter
These
people
will
never
understand
him
famous
legend
wouldn
surprised
today
was
known
Harry
Potter
day
the
future
there
will
books
written
about
Harry
every
child
our
world
will
know
his
name
Exactly
said
Dumbledore
looking
very
seriously
over
the
top
his
half
moon
glasses
would
enough
turn
any
boy
head
Famous
before
can
walk
and
talk
Famous
for
something
won
even
remember
CarA
you
see
how
much
better
off
growing
away
from
all
that
until
ready
take
Professor
McGonagall
opened
her
mouth
changed
her
mind
swallowed
and
then
said
Yes
yes
you
right
course
But
how
the
boy
getting
here
Dumbledore
She
eyed
his
cloak
suddenly
though
she
thought
might
hiding
Harry
underneath
Hagrid
bringing
him
You
think
wise
trust
Hagrid
with
something
important
this
would
trust
Hagrid
with
life
said
Dumbledore
not
saying
his
heart
isn
the
right
place
said
Professor
McGonagall
grudgingly
but
you
can
pretend
not
careless
does
tend
what
was
that
low
rumbling
sound
had
broken
the
silence
around
them
grew
steadily
louder
they
looked
and
down
the
street
for
some
sign
headlight
swelled
roar
they
both
looked
the
sky
and
huge
motorcycle
fell
out
the
air
and
landed
the
road
front
them
the
motorcycle
was
huge
was
nothing
the
man
sitting
astride
was
almost
twice
tall
normal
man
and
least
five
times
wide
looked
simply
too
big
allowed
and
wild
long
tangles
bushy
black
hair
and
beard
hid
most
his
face
had
hands
the
size
trash
can
lids
and
his
feet
their
leather
boots
were
like
baby
dolphins
his
vast
muscular
arms
was
holding
bundle
blankets
Hagrid
said
Dumbledore
sounding
relieved
last
And
where
did
you
get
that
motorcycle
Borrowed
Professor
Dumbledore
sit
said
the
giant
climbing
carefully
off
the
motorcycle
spoke
Young
Sirius
Black
lent
got
him
sir
problems
were
there
sir
house
was
almost
destroyed
but
got
him
out
all
right
before
the
Muggles
started
swarmin
around
fell
asleep
was
flyin
over
Bristol
Dumbledore
and
Professor
McGonagall
bent
forward
over
the
bundle
blankets
Inside
just
visible
was
baby
boy
fast
asleep
Under
tuft
jet
black
hair
over
his
forehead
they
could
see
curiously
shaped
cut
like
bolt
lightning
that
where
whispered
Professor
McGonagall
Yes
said
Dumbledore
have
that
scar
forever
Couldn
you
something
about
Dumbledore
Even
could
wouldn
Scars

come
handy

one
myself
above

knee
that
perfect
map
the
London
Underground
Well
give
him
here
Hagrid

get
this
over
with
Dumbledore
took
Harry
his
arms
and
turned
toward
the
Dursleys
house
Could
could
say
good
bye
him
sir
asked
Hagrid
bent
his
great
shaggy
head
over
Harry
and
gave
him
what
must
have
been
very
scratchy
whiskery
kiss
Then
suddenly
Hagrid
let
out
howl
like
wounded
dog
Shhh
hissed
Professor
McGonagall
you
wake
the
Muggles
sorry
sobbed
Hagrid
taking
out
large
spotted
handkerchief
and
burying
his
face
But
can
stand
Lily
James
dead
poor
little
Harry
off
ter
live
with
Muggles
Yes
yes
all
very
sad
but
get
grip
yourself
Hagrid
found
Professor
McGonagall
whispered
patting
Hagrid
gingerly
the
arm
Dumbledore
stepped
over
the
low
garden
wall
and
walked
the
front
door
laid
Harry
gently
the
doorstep
took
letter
out
his
cloak
tucked
inside
Harry
blankets
and
then
came
back
the
other
two
For
full
minute
the
three
them
stood
and
looked
the
little
bundle
Hagrid
shoulders
shook
Professor
McGonagall
blinked
furiously
and
the
twinkling
light
that
usually
shone
from
Dumbledore
eyes
seemed
have
gone
out
Well
said
Dumbledore
finally
that
that
business
staying
here
may
well
and
join
the
celebrations
Yeah
said
Hagrid
very
muffled
voice
takin
Sirius
his
bike
back
night
Professor
McGonagall
Professor
Dumbledore
sir
Wiping
his
streaming
eyes
his
jacket
sleeve
Hagrid
swung
himself
onto
the
motorcycle
and
kicked
the
engine
into
life
with
roar
rose
into
the
air
and
off
into
the
night
shall
see
you
soon
expect
Professor
McGonagall
said
Dumbledore
nodding
her
Professor
McGonagall
blew
her
nose
reply
Dumbledore
turned
and
walked
back
down
the
street
the
corner
stopped
and
took
out
the
silver
Put
Outer
clicked
once
and
twelve
balls
light
sped
back
their
street
lamps
that
Privet
Drive
glowed
suddenly
orange
and
could
make
out
tabby
cat
slinking
around
the
corner
the
other
end
the
street
could
just
see
the
bundle
blankets
the
step
number
four
Good
luck
Harry
murmured
turned
his
heel
and
with
swish
his
cloak
was
gone
breeze
ruffled
the
neat
hedges
Privet
Drive
which
lay
silent
and
tidy
under
the
inky
sky
the
very
last
place
you
would
expect
astonishing
things
happen
Harry
Potter
rolled
over
inside
his
blankets
without
waking
One
small
hand
closed
the
letter
beside
him
and
slept
not
knowing
was
special
not
knowing
was
famous
not
knowing
would
woken
few
hours
time
Mrs
Dursley
scream
she
opened
the
front
door
put
out
the
milk
bottles
nor
that
would
spend
the
next
few
weeks
being
prodded
and
pinched
his
cousin
Dudley
couldn
know
that
this
very
moment
people
meeting
secret
all
over
the
country
were
holding
their
glasses
and
saying
hushed
voices
Harry
Potter
the
boy
who
lived
CHAPTER
TWO
THE
VANISHING
GLASS
Nearly
ten
years
had
passed
since
the
Dursleys
had
woken
find
their
nephew
the
front
step
but
Privet
Drive
had
hardly
changed
all
The
sun
rose
the
same
tidy
front
gardens
and
lit
the
brass
number
four
the
Dursleys
front
door
crept
into
their
living
room
which
was
almost
exactly
the
same
had
been
the
night
when
Dursley
had
seen
that
fateful
news
report
about
the
owls
Only
the
photographs
the
mantelpiece
really
showed
how
much
time
had
passed
Ten
years
ago
there
had
been
lots
pictures
what
looked
like
large
pink
beach
ball
wearing
different
colored
bonnets
but
Dudley
Dursley
was
longer
baby
and
now
the
photographs
showed
large
blond
boy
riding
his
first
bicycle
carousel
the
fair
playing
computer
game
with
his
father
being
hugged
and
kissed
his
mother
The
room
held
sign
all
that
another
boy
lived
the
house
too
Yet
Harry
Potter
was
still
there
asleep
the
moment
but
not
for
long
His
Aunt
Petunia
was
awake
and
was
her
shrill
voice
that
made
the
first
noise
the
day
Get
Now
Harry
woke
with
start
His
aunt
rapped
the
door
again
she
screeched
Harry
heard
her
walking
toward
the
kitchen
and
then
the
sound
the
frying
pan
being
put
the
stove
rolled
onto
his
back
and
tried
remember
the
dream
had
been
having
had
been
good
one
There
had
been
flying
motorcycle
had
funny
feeling
had
the
same
dream
before
His
aunt
was
back
outside
the
door
Are
you
yet
she
demanded
Nearly
said
Harry
Well
get
move
want
you
look
after
the
bacon
And
don
you
dare
let
burn
want
everything
perfect
Duddy
birthday
Harry
groaned
What
did
you
say
his
aunt
snapped
through
the
door
Nothing
nothing
Dudley
birthday
how
could
have
forgotten
Harry
got
slowly
out
bed
and
started
looking
for
socks
found
pair
under
his
bed
and
after
pulling
spider
off
one
them
put
them
Harry
was
used
spiders
because
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
was
full
them
and
that
was
where
slept
When
was
dressed
went
down
the
hall
into
the
kitchen
The
table
was
almost
hidden
beneath
all
Dudley
birthday
presents
looked
though
Dudley
had
gotten
the
new
computer
wanted
not
mention
the
second
television
and
the
racing
bike
Exactly
why
Dudley
wanted
racing
bike
was
mystery
Harry
Dudley
was
very
fat
and
hated
exercise
unless
course
involved
punching
somebody
Dudley
favorite
punching
bag
was
Harry
but
couldn
often
catch
him
Harry
didn
look
but
was
very
fast
Perhaps
had
something
with
living
dark
cupboard
but
Harry
had
always
been
small
and
skinny
for
his
age
looked
even
smaller
and
skinnier
than
really
was
because
all
had
wear
were
old
clothes
Dudley
and
Dudley
was
about
four
times
bigger
than
was
Harry
had
thin
face
knobbly
knees
black
hair
and
bright
green
eyes
wore
round
glasses
held
together
with
lot
Scotch
tape
because
all
the
times
Dudley
had
punched
him
the
nose
The
only
thing
Harry
liked
about
his
own
appearance
was
very
thin
scar
his
forehead
that
was
shaped
like
bolt
lightning
had
had
long
could
remember
and
the
first
question
could
ever
remember
asking
his
Aunt
Petunia
was
how
had
gotten
the
car
crash
when
your
parents
died
she
had
said
And
don
ask
questions
Don
ask
questions
that
was
the
first
rule
for
quiet
life
with
the
Dursleys
Uncle
Vernon
entered
the
kitchen
Harry
was
turning
over
the
bacon
Comb
your
hair
barked
way
morning
greeting
About
once
week
Uncle
Vernon
looked
over
the
top
his
newspaper
and
shouted
that
Harry
needed
haircut
Harry
must
have
had
more
haircuts
than
the
rest
the
boys
his
class
put
together
but
made
difference
his
hair
simply
grew
that
way
all
over
the
place
Harry
was
frying
eggs
the
time
Dudley
arrived
the
kitchen
with
his
mother
Dudley
looked
lot
like
Uncle
Vernon
had
large
pink
face
not
much
neck
small
watery
blue
eyes
and
thick
blond
hair
that
lay
smoothly
his
thick
fat
head
Aunt
Petunia
often
said
that
Dudley
looked
like
baby
angel
Harry
often
said
that
Dudley
looked
like
pig
wig
Harry
put
the
plates
egg
and
bacon
the
table
which
was
difficult
there
wasn
much
room
Dudley
meanwhile
was
counting
his
presents
His
face
fell
Thirty
six
said
looking
his
mother
and
father
That
two
less
than
last
year
Darling
you
haven
counted
Auntie
Marge
present
see
here
under
this
big
one
from
Mommy
and
Daddy
All
right
thirty
seven
then
said
Dudley
going
red
the
face
Harry
who
could
see
huge
Dudley
tantrum
coming
began
wolfing
down
his
bacon
fast
possible
case
Dudley
turned
the
table
over
Aunt
Petunia
obviously
scented
danger
too
because
she
said
quickly
And
buy
you
another
two
presents
while
out
today
How
that
popkin
Two
more
presents
that
all
right
Dudley
thought
for
moment
looked
like
hard
work
Finally
said
slowly
have
thirty
thirty
Thirty
nine
sweetums
said
Aunt
Petunia
Dudley
sat
down
heavily
and
grabbed
the
nearest
parcel
All
right
then
Uncle
Vernon
chuckled
Little
tyke
wants
his
money
worth
just
like
his
father
Atta
boy
Dudley
ruffled
Dudley
hair
that
moment
the
telephone
rang
and
Aunt
Petunia
went
answer
while
Harry
and
Uncle
Vernon
watched
Dudley
unwrap
the
racing
bike
video
camera
remote
control
airplane
sixteen
new
computer
games
and
VCR
was
ripping
the
paper
off
gold
wristwatch
when
Aunt
Petunia
came
back
from
the
telephone
looking
both
angry
and
worried
Bad
news
Vernon
she
said
Mrs
Figg
broken
her
leg
She
can
take
him
She
jerked
her
head
Harry
direction
Dudley
mouth
fell
open
horror
but
Harry
heart
gave
leap
Every
year
Dudley
birthday
his
parents
took
him
and
friend
out
for
the
day
adventure
parks
hamburger
restaurants
the
movies
Every
year
Harry
was
left
behind
with
Mrs
Figg
mad
old
lady
who
lived
two
streets
away
Harry
hated
there
The
whole
house
smelled
cabbage
and
Mrs
Figg
made
him
look
photographs
all
the
cats
she
ever
owned
Now
what
said
Aunt
Petunia
looking
furiously
Harry
though
planned
this
Harry
knew
ought
feel
sorry
that
Mrs
Figg
had
broken
her
leg
but
wasn
easy
when
reminded
himself
would
whole
year
before
had
look
Tibbles
Snowy
Paws
and
Tufty
again
could
phone
Marge
Uncle
Vernon
suggested
Don
silly
Vernon
she
hates
the
boy
The
Dursleys
often
spoke
about
Harry
like
this
though
wasn
there
rather
though
was
something
very
nasty
that
couldn
understand
them
like
slug
What
about
what
her
name
your
friend
Yvonne
vacation
Majorca
snapped
Aunt
Petunia
You
could
just
leave
here
Harry
put
hopefully
able
watch
what
wanted
television
for
change
and
maybe
even
have
Dudley
computer
Aunt
Petunia
looked
though
she
just
swallowed
lemon
And
come
back
and
find
the
house
ruins
she
snarled
won
blow
the
house
said
Harry
but
they
weren
listening
suppose
could
take
him
the
zoo
said
Aunt
Petunia
slowly
and
leave
him
the
car
That
car
new
not
sitting
alone
Dudley
began
cry
loudly
fact
wasn
really
crying
had
been
years
since
really
cried
but
knew
that
screwed
his
face
and
wailed
his
mother
would
give
him
anything
wanted
Dinky
Duddydums
don
cry
Mummy
won
let
him
spoil
your
special
day
she
cried
flinging
her
arms
around
him
don
want
him
come
Dudley
yelled
between
huge
pretend
sobs
always
spoils
everything
shot
Harry
nasty
grin
through
the
gap
his
mother
arms
Just
then
the
doorbell
rang
good
Lord
they
here
said
Aunt
Petunia
frantically
and
moment
later
Dudley
best
friend
Piers
Polkiss
walked
with
his
mother
Piers
was
scrawny
boy
with
face
like
rat
was
usually
the
one
who
held
people
arms
behind
their
backs
while
Dudley
hit
them
Dudley
stopped
pretending
cry
once
Half
hour
later
Harry
who
couldn
believe
his
luck
was
sitting
the
back
the
Dursleys
car
with
Piers
and
Dudley
the
way
the
zoo
for
the
first
time
his
life
His
aunt
and
uncle
hadn
been
able
think
anything
else
with
him
but
before
they
left
Uncle
Vernon
had
taken
Harry
aside
warning
you
had
said
putting
his
large
purple
face
right
close
Harry
warning
you
now
boy
any
funny
business
anything
all
and
you
that
cupboard
from
now
until
Christmas
not
going
anything
said
Harry
honestly
But
Uncle
Vernon
didn
believe
him
one
ever
did
The
problem
was
strange
things
often
happened
around
Harry
and
was
just
good
telling
the
Dursleys
didn
make
them
happen
Once
Aunt
Petunia
tired
Harry
coming
back
from
the
barbers
looking
though
hadn
been
all
had
taken
pair
kitchen
scissors
and
cut
his
hair
short
was
almost
bald
except
for
his
bangs
which
she
left
hide
that
horrible
scar
Dudley
had
laughed
himself
silly
Harry
who
spent
sleepless
night
imagining
school
the
next
day
where
was
already
laughed
for
his
baggy
clothes
and
taped
glasses
Next
morning
however
had
gotten
find
his
hair
exactly
had
been
before
Aunt
Petunia
had
sheared
off
had
been
given
week
his
cupboard
for
this
even
though
had
tried
explain
that
couldn
explain
how
had
grown
back
quickly
Another
time
Aunt
Petunia
had
been
trying
force
him
into
revolting
old
sweater
Dudley
brown
with
orange
puff
balls
The
harder
she
tried
pull
over
his
head
the
smaller
seemed
become
until
finally
might
have
fitted
hand
puppet
but
certainly
wouldn
fit
Harry
Aunt
Petunia
had
decided
must
have
shrunk
the
wash
and
his
great
relief
Harry
wasn
punished
the
other
hand
gotten
into
terrible
trouble
for
being
found
the
roof
the
school
kitchens
Dudley
gang
had
been
chasing
him
usual
when
much
Harry
surprise
anyone
else
there
was
sitting
the
chimney
The
Dursleys
had
received
very
angry
letter
from
Harry
headmistress
telling
them
Harry
had
been
climbing
school
buildings
But
all
tried
shouted
Uncle
Vernon
through
the
locked
door
his
cupboard
was
jump
behind
the
big
trash
cans
outside
the
kitchen
doors
Harry
supposed
that
the
wind
must
have
caught
him
mid
jump
But
today
nothing
was
going
wrong
was
even
worth
being
with
Dudley
and
Piers
spending
the
day
somewhere
that
wasn
school
his
cupboard
Mrs
Figg
cabbage
smelling
living
room
While
drove
Uncle
Vernon
complained
Aunt
Petunia
liked
complain
about
things
people
work
Harry
the
council
Harry
the
bank
and
Harry
were
just
few
his
favorite
subjects
This
morning
was
motorcycles
roaring
along
like
maniacs
the
young
hoodlums
said
motorcycle
overtook
them
had
dream
about
motorcycle
said
Harry
remembering
suddenly
was
flying
Uncle
Vernon
nearly
crashed
into
the
car
front
turned
right
around
his
seat
and
yelled
Harry
his
face
like
gigantic
beet
with
mustache
MOTORCYCLES
DON
FLY
Dudley
and
Piers
sniggered
know
they
don
said
Harry
was
only
dream
But
wished
hadn
said
anything
there
was
one
thing
the
Dursleys
hated
even
more
than
his
asking
questions
was
his
talking
about
anything
acting
way
shouldn
matter
was
dream
even
cartoon
they
seemed
think
might
get
dangerous
ideas
was
very
sunny
Saturday
and
the
zoo
was
crowded
with
families
The
Dursleys
bought
Dudley
and
Piers
large
chocolate
ice
creams
the
entrance
and
then
because
the
smiling
lady
the
van
had
asked
Harry
what
wanted
before
they
could
hurry
him
away
they
bought
him
cheap
lemon
ice
pop
wasn
bad
either
Harry
thought
licking
they
watched
gorilla
scratching
its
head
who
looked
remarkably
like
Dudley
except
that
wasn
blond
Harry
had
the
best
morning
had
long
time
was
careful
walk
little
way
apart
from
the
Dursleys
that
Dudley
and
Piers
who
were
starting
get
bored
with
the
animals
lunchtime
wouldn
fall
back
their
favorite
hobby
hitting
him
They
ate
the
zoo
restaurant
and
when
Dudley
had
tantrum
because
his
knickerbocker
glory
didn
have
enough
ice
cream
top
Uncle
Vernon
bought
him
another
one
and
Harry
was
allowed
finish
the
first
Harry
felt
afterward
that
should
have
known
was
all
too
good
last
After
lunch
they
went
the
reptile
house
was
cool
and
dark
there
with
lit
windows
all
along
the
walls
Behind
the
glass
all
sorts
lizards
and
snakes
were
crawling
and
slithering
over
bits
wood
and
stone
Dudley
and
Piers
wanted
see
huge
poisonous
cobras
and
thick
man
crushing
pythons
Dudley
quickly
found
the
largest
snake
the
place
could
have
wrapped
its
body
twice
around
Uncle
Vernon
car
and
crushed
into
trash
can
but
the
moment
didn
look
the
mood
fact
was
fast
asleep
Dudley
stood
with
his
nose
pressed
against
the
glass
staring
the
glistening
brown
coils
Make
move
whined
his
father
Uncle
Vernon
tapped
the
glass
but
the
snake
didn
budge
again
Dudley
ordered
Uncle
Vernon
rapped
the
glass
smartly
with
his
knuckles
but
the
snake
just
snoozed
This
boring
Dudley
moaned
shuffled
away
Harry
moved
front
the
tank
and
looked
intently
the
snake
wouldn
have
been
surprised
had
died
boredom
itself
company
except
stupid
people
drumming
their
fingers
the
glass
trying
disturb
all
day
long
was
worse
than
having
cupboard
bedroom
where
the
only
visitor
was
Aunt
Petunia
hammering
the
door
wake
you
least
got
visit
the
rest
the
house
The
snake
suddenly
opened
its
beady
eyes
Slowly
very
slowly
raised
its
head
until
its
eyes
were
level
with
Harry
winked
Harry
stared
Then
looked
quickly
around
see
anyone
was
watching
They
weren
looked
back
the
snake
and
winked
too
The
snake
jerked
its
head
toward
Uncle
Vernon
and
Dudley
then
raised
its
eyes
the
ceiling
gave
Harry
look
that
said
quite
plainly
get
that
all
the
time
know
Harry
murmured
through
the
glass
though
wasn
sure
the
snake
could
hear
him
must
really
annoying
The
snake
nodded
vigorously
Where
you
come
from
anyway
Harry
asked
The
snake
jabbed
its
tail
little
sign
next
the
glass
Harry
peered
Boa
Constrictor
Brazil
Was
nice
there
The
boa
constrictor
jabbed
its
tail
the
sign
again
and
Harry
read
This
specimen
was
bred
the
zoo
see
you
never
been
Brazil
the
snake
shook
its
head
deafening
shout
behind
Harry
made
both
them
jump
DUDLEY
DURSLEY
COME
AND
LOOK
THIS
SNAKE
YOU
WON
BELIEVE
WHAT
DOING
Dudley
came
waddling
toward
them
fast
could
Out
the
way
you
said
punching
Harry
the
ribs
Caught
surprise
Harry
fell
hard
the
concrete
floor
What
came
next
happened
fast
one
saw
how
happened
one
second
Piers
and
Dudley
were
leaning
right
close
the
glass
the
next
they
had
leapt
back
with
howls
horror
Harry
sat
and
gasped
the
glass
front
the
boa
constrictor
tank
had
vanished
The
great
snake
was
uncoiling
itself
rapidly
slithering
out
onto
the
floor
People
throughout
the
reptile
house
screamed
and
started
running
for
the
exits
the
snake
slid
swiftly
past
him
Harry
could
have
sworn
low
hissing
voice
said
Brazil
here
come
Thanksss
amigo
The
keeper
the
reptile
house
was
shock
But
the
glass
kept
saying
where
did
the
glass
The
zoo
director
himself
made
Aunt
Petunia
cup
strong
sweet
tea
while
apologized
over
and
over
again
Piers
and
Dudley
could
only
gibber
far
Harry
had
seen
the
snake
hadn
done
anything
except
snap
playfully
their
heels
passed
but
the
time
they
were
all
back
Uncle
Vernon
car
Dudley
was
telling
them
how
had
nearly
bitten
off
his
leg
while
Piers
was
swearing
had
tried
squeeze
him
death
But
worst
all
for
Harry
least
was
Piers
calming
down
enough
say
Harry
was
talking
weren
you
Harry
Uncle
Vernon
waited
until
Piers
was
safely
out
the
house
before
starting
Harry
was
angry
could
hardly
speak
managed
say
cupboard
stay
meals
before
collapsed
into
chair
and
Aunt
Petunia
had
run
and
get
him
large
brandy
Harry
lay
his
dark
cupboard
much
later
wishing
had
watch
didn
know
what
time
was
and
couldn
sure
the
Dursleys
were
asleep
yet
Until
they
were
couldn
risk
sneaking
the
kitchen
for
some
food
lived
with
the
Dursleys
almost
ten
years
ten
miserable
years
long
could
remember
ever
since
been
baby
and
his
parents
had
died
that
car
crash
couldn
remember
being
the
car
when
his
parents
had
died
Sometimes
when
strained
his
memory
during
long
hours
his
cupboard
came
with
strange
vision
blinding
flash
green
light
and
burn
ing
pain
his
forehead
This
supposed
was
the
crash
though
couldn
imagine
where
all
the
green
light
came
from
couldn
remember
his
parents
all
His
aunt
and
uncle
never
spoke
about
them
and
course
was
forbidden
ask
questions
There
were
photographs
them
the
house
When
had
been
younger
Harry
had
dreamed
and
dreamed
some
unknown
relation
coming
take
him
away
but
had
never
happened
the
Dursleys
were
his
only
family
Yet
sometimes
thought
maybe
hoped
that
strangers
the
street
seemed
know
him
Very
strange
strangers
they
were
too
tiny
man
violet
top
hat
had
bowed
him
once
while
out
shopping
with
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
After
asking
Harry
furiously
knew
the
man
Aunt
Petunia
had
rushed
them
out
the
shop
without
buying
anything
wild
looking
old
woman
dressed
all
green
had
waved
merrily
him
once
bus
bald
man
very
long
purple
coat
had
actually
shaken
his
hand
the
street
the
other
day
and
then
walked
away
without
word
The
weirdest
thing
about
all
these
people
was
the
way
they
seemed
vanish
the
second
Harry
tried
get
closer
look
school
Harry
had
one
Everybody
knew
that
Dudley
gang
hated
that
odd
Harry
Potter
his
baggy
old
clothes
and
broken
glasses
and
nobody
liked
disagree
with
Dudley
gang
CHAPTER
THREE
THE
LETTERS
FROM
ONE
The
escape
the
Brazilian
boa
constrictor
earned
Harry
his
longest
ever
punishment
the
time
was
allowed
out
his
cupboard
again
the
summer
holidays
had
started
and
Dudley
had
already
broken
his
new
video
camera
crashed
his
remote
control
airplane
and
first
time
out
his
racing
bike
knocked
down
old
Mrs
Figg
she
crossed
Privet
Drive
her
crutches
Harry
was
glad
school
was
over
but
there
was
escaping
Dudley
gang
who
visited
the
house
every
single
day
Piers
Dennis
Malcolm
and
Gordon
were
all
big
and
stupid
but
Dudley
was
the
biggest
and
stupidest
the
lot
was
the
leader
The
rest
them
were
all
quite
happy
join
Dudley
favorite
sport
Harry
Hunting
This
was
why
Harry
spent
much
time
possible
out
the
house
wandering
around
and
thinking
about
the
end
the
holidays
where
could
see
tiny
ray
hope
When
September
came
would
going
off
secondary
school
and
for
the
first
time
his
life
wouldn
with
Dudley
Dudley
had
been
accepted
Uncle
Vernon
old
private
school
Smeltings
Piers
Polkiss
was
going
there
too
Harry
the
other
hand
was
going
Stonewall
High
the
local
public
school
Dudley
thought
this
was
very
funny
They
stuff
people
heads
down
the
toilet
the
first
day
Stonewall
told
Harry
Want
come
upstairs
and
practice
thanks
said
Harry
The
poor
toilet
never
had
anything
horrible
your
head
down
might
sick
Then
ran
before
Dudley
could
work
out
what
said
One
day
July
Aunt
Petunia
took
Dudley
London
buy
his
Smeltings
uniform
leaving
Harry
Mrs
Figg
Mrs
Figg
wasn
bad
usual
turned
out
she
broken
her
leg
tripping
over
one
her
cats
and
she
didn
seem
quite
fond
them
before
She
let
Harry
watch
television
and
gave
him
bit
chocolate
cake
that
tasted
though
she
had
for
several
years
That
evening
Dudley
paraded
around
the
living
room
for
the
family
his
brand
new
uniform
Smeltings
boys
wore
maroon
tailcoats
orange
knickerbockers
and
flat
straw
hats
called
boaters
They
also
carried
knobbly
sticks
used
for
hitting
each
other
while
the
teachers
weren
looking
This
was
supposed
good
training
for
later
life
looked
Dudley
his
new
knickerbockers
Uncle
Vernon
said
gruffly
that
was
the
proudest
moment
his
life
Aunt
Petunia
burst
into
tears
and
said
she
couldn
believe
was
her
Ickle
Dudleykins
looked
handsome
and
grown
Harry
didn
trust
himself
speak
thought
two
his
ribs
might
already
have
cracked
from
trying
not
laugh
There
was
horrible
smell
the
kitchen
the
next
morning
when
Harry
went
for
breakfast
seemed
coming
from
large
metal
tub
the
sink
went
have
look
The
tub
was
full
what
looked
like
dirty
rags
swimming
gray
water
What
this
asked
Aunt
Petunia
Her
lips
tightened
they
always
did
dared
ask
question
Your
new
school
uniform
she
said
Harry
looked
the
bowl
again
said
didn
realize
had
wet
DotA
stupid
snapped
Aunt
Petunia
dyeing
some
Dudley
old
things
gray
for
you
look
just
like
everyone
else
when
finished
Harry
seriously
doubted
this
but
thought
best
not
argue
sat
down
the
table
and
tried
not
think
about
how
was
going
look
his
first
day
Stonewall
High
like
was
wearing
bits
old
elephant
skin
probably
Dudley
and
Uncle
Vernon
came
both
with
wrinkled
noses
because
the
smell
from
Harry
new
uniform
Uncle
Vernon
opened
his
newspaper
usual
and
Dudley
banged
his
Smelting
stick
which
carried
everywhere
the
table
They
heard
the
click
the
mail
slot
and
flop
letters
the
doormat
Get
the
mail
Dudley
said
Uncle
Vernon
from
behind
his
paper
Make
Harry
get
Get
the
mail
Harry
Make
Dudley
get
Poke
him
with
your
Smelting
stick
Dudley
Harry
dodged
the
Smelting
stick
and
went
get
the
mail
Three
things
lay
the
doormat
postcard
from
Uncle
Vernon
sister
Marge
who
was
vacationing
the
Isle
Wight
brown
envelope
that
looked
like
bill
and
letter
for
Harry
Harry
picked
and
stared
his
heart
twanging
like
giant
elastic
band
one
ever
his
whole
life
had
written
him
Who
would
had
friends
other
relatives
didn
belong
the
library
never
even
got
rude
notes
asking
for
books
back
Yet
here
was
letter
addressed
plainly
there
could
mistake
Potter
The
Cupboard
under
the
Stairs
Privet
Drive
Little
Whinging
Surrey
The
envelope
was
thick
and
heavy
made
yellowish
parchment
and
the
address
was
written
emerald
green
ink
There
was
stamp
Turning
the
envelope
over
his
hand
trembling
Harry
saw
purple
wax
seal
bearing
coat
arms
lion
eagle
badger
and
snake
surrounding
large
letter
Hurry
boy
shouted
Uncle
Vernon
from
the
kitchen
What
are
you
doing
checking
for
letter
bombs
chuckled
his
own
joke
Harry
went
back
the
kitchen
still
staring
his
letter
handed
Uncle
Vernon
the
bill
and
the
postcard
sat
down
and
slowly
began
open
the
yellow
envelope
Uncle
Vernon
ripped
open
the
bill
snorted
disgust
and
flipped
over
the
postcard
Marge
ill
informed
Aunt
Petunia
Ate
funny
whelk
Dad
said
Dudley
suddenly
Dad
Harry
got
something
Harry
was
the
point
unfolding
his
letter
which
was
written
the
same
heavy
parchment
the
envelope
when
was
jerked
sharply
out
his
hand
Uncle
Vernon
That
mine
said
Harry
trying
snatch
back
Who
writing
you
sneered
Uncle
Vernon
shaking
the
letter
open
with
one
hand
and
glancing
His
face
went
from
red
green
faster
than
set
traffic
lights
And
didn
stop
there
Within
seconds
was
the
grayish
white
old
porridge
Petunia
gasped
Dudley
tried
grab
the
letter
read
but
Uncle
Vernon
held
high
out
his
reach
Aunt
Petunia
took
curiously
and
read
the
first
line
For
moment
looked
though
she
might
faint
She
clutched
her
throat
and
made
choking
noise
Vernon
goodness
Vernon
They
stared
each
other
seeming
have
forgotten
that
Harry
and
Dudley
were
still
the
room
Dudley
wasn
used
being
ignored
gave
his
father
sharp
tap
the
head
with
his
Smelting
stick
want

that
letter
said
loudly

said
Harry
furiously
mine
Get

croaked
Uncle
Vernon
stuffing
the
letter
back
inside
its
envelope
Harry
didn
move
WANT
LETTER
shouted
Let
see
demanded
Dudley
OUT
roared
Uncle
Vernon
and
took
both
Harry
and
Dudley
the
scruffs
their
necks
and
threw
them
into
the
hall
slamming
the
kitchen
door
behind
them
Harry
and
Dudley
promptly
had
furious
but
silent
fight
over
who
would
listen
the
keyhole
Dudley
won
Harry
his
glasses
dangling
from
one
ear
lay
flat
his
stomach
listen
the
crack
between
door
and
floor
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia
was
saying
quivering
voice
look
the
address
how
could
they
possibly
know
where

You
don
think
they
watching
the
house
Watching

muttered
Uncle
Vernon
wildly
But
what
should
Vernon
Should

Harry
could
see
Uncle
Vernon
shiny
black
shoes
pacing
and
down
the
kitchen
said
finally

get
answer
Yes

best
won

But

Petunia
Didn
swear
when
took
him
stamp
out
that
dangerous
nonsense
That
evening
when
got
back
from
work
Uncle
Vernon
did
something
never
done
before
visited
Harry
his
cupboard
Where
letter
said
Harry

moment
Uncle
Vernon
had
squeezed
through
the
door

Uncle
Vernon
shortly
have
burned

said
Harry
angrily
had

SILENCE
yelled
Uncle
Vernon
and
couple
spiders
fell
from
the
ceiling
took
few
deep
breaths
and
then
forced
his
face
into
smile
which
looked
quite
painful
yes
Harry
about
this
cupboard
Your
aunt
and
have
been
thinking
you
really
getting
bit
big
for
think
might
nice
you
moved
into
Dudley
second
bedroom
Why
said
Harry
Don
ask
questions
snapped
his
uncle
Take
this
stuff
upstairs
now
The
Dursleys
house
had
four
bedrooms
one
for
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
one
for
visitors
usually
Uncle
Vernon
sister
Marge
one
where
Dudley
slept
and
one
where
Dudley
kept
all
the
toys
and
things
that
wouldn
fit
into
his
first
bedroom
only
took
Harry
one
trip
upstairs
move
everything
owned
from
the
cupboard
this
room
sat
down
the
bed
and
stared
around
him
Nearly
everything
here
was
broken
The
month
old
video
camera
was
lying
top
small
working
tank
Dudley
had
once
driven
over
the
next
door
neighbor
dog
the
corner
was
Dudley
first
ever
television
set
which
put
his
foot
through
when
his
favorite
program
had
been
canceled
there
was
large
birdcage
which
had
once
held
parrot
that
Dudley
had
swapped
school
for
real
air
rifle
which
was
shelf
with
the
end
all
bent
because
Dudley
had
sat
Other
shelves
were
full
books
They
were
the
only
things
the
room
that
looked
though
they
never
been
touched
From
downstairs
came
the
sound
Dudley
bawling
his
mother
don
want
him
there
need
that
room
make
him
get

Harry
sighed
and
stretched
out
the
bed
Yesterday

Today

his
cupboard
with
that
letter
than

Next

whacked
his
father
with
his
Smelting
stick

still
didn
have
his
room
back
Harry
was
thinking
about
this
time
yesterday
and
bitterly
wishing
opened
the
letter
the
hall
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
kept
looking
each
other
darkly
When
the
mail
arrived
Uncle
Vernon
who
seemed
trying
nice
Harry
made
Dudley
and
get
They
heard
him
banging
things
with
his
Smelting
stick
all
the
way
down
the
hall
Then
shouted
There
another
one
Potter
The
Smallest
Bedroom
Privet
Drive
With
strangled
cry
Uncle
Vernon
leapt
from
his
seat
and
ran
down
the
hall
Harry
right
behind
him
Uncle
Vernon
had
wrestle
Dudley
the
ground
get
the
letter
from
him
which
was
made
difficult
the
fact
that
Harry
had
grabbed
Uncle
Vernon
around
the
neck
from
behind
After
minute
confused
fighting
which
everyone
got
hit
lot
the
Smelting
stick
Uncle
Vernon
straightened
gasping
for
breath
with
Harry
letter
clutched
his
hand
your
cupboard
mean
your
bedroom
wheezed
Harry
Dudley
just
Harry
walked
round
and
round
his
new
room
Someone
knew
had
moved
out
his
cupboard
and
they
seemed
know
hadn
received
his
first
letter
Surely
that
meant
they
try
again
And
this
time
make
sure
they
didn
fail
had
plan
The
repaired
alarm
clock
rang
six
clock
the
next
morning
Harry
turned
off
quickly
and
dressed
silently
mustn
wake
the
Dursleys
stole
downstairs
without
turning
any
the
lights
was
going
wait
for
the
postman
the
corner
Privet
Drive
and
get
the
letters
for
number
four
first
His
heart
hammered
crept
across
the
dark
hall
toward
the
front
door
Harry
leapt
into
the
air
trodden
something
big
and
squashy
the
doormat
something
alive
Lights
clicked
upstairs
and
his
horror
Harry
realized
that
the
big
squashy
something
had
been
his
uncle
face
Uncle
Vernon
had
been
lying
the
foot
the
front
door
sleeping
bag
clearly
making
sure
that
Harry
didn
exactly
what
been
trying
shouted
Harry
for
about
half
hour
and
then
told
him
and
make
cup
tea
Harry
shuffled
miserably
off
into
the
kitchen
and
the
time
got
back
the
mail
had
arrived
right
into
Uncle
Vernon
lap
Harry
could
see
three
letters
addressed
green
ink
want
began
but
Uncle
Vernon
was
tearing
the
letters
into
pieces
before
his
eyes
Uncle
Vernon
didnt
work
that
day
stayed
home
and
nailed
the
mail
slot
See
explained
Aunt
Petunia
through
mouthful
nails
they
can
deliver
them
they
just
give
not
sure
that
work
Vernon
these
people
minds
work
strange
ways
Petunia
they
not
like
you
and
said
Uncle
Vernon
trying
knock
nail
with
the
piece
fruitcake
Aunt
Petunia
had
just
brought
him
Friday
less
than
twelve
letters
arrived
for
Harry
they
couldn
through
the
mail
slot
they
had
been
pushed
under
the
door
slotted
through
the
sides
and
few
even
forced
through
the
small
window
the
downstairs
bathroom
Uncle
Vernon
stayed
home
again
After
burning
all
the
letters
got
out
hammer
and
nails
and
boarded
the
cracks
around
the
front
and
back
doors
one
could
out
hummed
Tiptoe
Through
the
Tulips
worked
and
jumped
small
noises
Saturday
things
began
get
out
hand
Twenty
four
letters
Harry
found
their
way
into
the
house
rolled
and
hidden
inside
each
the
two
dozen
eggs
that
their
very
confused
milkman
had
handed
Aunt
Petunia
through
the
living
room
window
While
Uncle
Vernon
made
furious
telephone
calls
the
post
office
and
the
dairy
trying
find
someone
complain
Aunt
Petunia
shredded
the
letters
her
food
processor
Who
earth
wants
talk
you
this
badly
Dudley
asked
Harry
amazement
Sunday
morning
Uncle
Vernon
sat
down
the
breakfast
table
looking
tired
and
rather
ill
but
happy
post
Sundays
reminded
them
cheerfully
spread
marmalade
his
newspapers
damn
letters
today
Something
came
whizzing
down
the
kitchen
chimney
spoke
and
caught
him
sharply
the
back
the
head
Next
moment
thirty
forty
letters
came
pelting
out
the
fireplace
like
bullets
The
Dursleys
ducked
but
Harry
leapt
into
the
air
trying
catch
one
Out
OUT
Uncle
Vernon
seized
Harry
around
the
waist
and
threw
him
into
the
hall
When
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
had
run
out
with
their
arms
over
their
faces
Uncle
Vernon
slammed
the
door
shut
They
could
hear
the
letters
still
streaming
into
the
room
bouncing
off
the
walls
and
floor
That
does
said
Uncle
Vernon
trying
speak
calmly
but
pulling
great
tufts
out
his
mustache
the
same
time
want
you
all
back
here
five
minutes
ready
leave
going
away
Just
pack
some
clothes
arguments
looked
dangerous
with
half
his
mustache
missing
that
one
dared
argue
Ten
minutes
later
they
had
wrenched
their
way
through
the
boarded
doors
and
were
the
car
speeding
toward
the
highway
Dudley
was
sniffling
the
back
seat
his
father
had
hit
him
round
the
head
for
holding
them
while
tried
pack
his
television
VCR
and
computer
his
sports
bag
They
drove
And
they
drove
Even
Aunt
Petunia
didn
dare
ask
where
they
were
going
Every
now
and
then
Uncle
Vernon
would
take
sharp
turn
and
drive
the
opposite
direction
for
while
Shake
off
shake
off
would
mutter
whenever
did
this
They
didn
stop
eat
drink
all
day
nightfall
Dudley
was
howling
never
had
such
bad
day
his
life
was
hungry
missed
five
television
programs
wanted
see
and
never
gone
long
without
blowing
alien
his
computer
Uncle
Vernon
stopped
last
outside
gloomy
looking
hotel
the
outskirts
big
city
Dudley
and
Harry
shared
room
with
twin
beds
and
damp
musty
sheets
Dudley
snored
but
Harry
stayed
awake
sitting
the
windowsill
staring
down
the
lights
passing
cars
and
wondering
They
ate
stale
cornflakes
and
cold
tinned
tomatoes
toast
for
breakfast
the
next
day
They
had
just
finished
when
the
owner
the
hotel
came
over
their
table
Scuse
but
one

Potter
Only
got
about
undred
these
the
front
desk
She
held
letter
they
could
read
the
green
ink
address
Potter
Room
Railview
Hotel
Cokeworth
Harry
made
grab
for
the
letter
but
Uncle
Vernon
knocked
his
hand
out
the
way
The
woman
stared
take
them
said
Uncle
Vernon
standing
quickly
and
following
her
from
the
dining
room
Wouldn
better
just
home
dear
Aunt
Petunia
suggested
timidly
hours
later
but
Uncle
Vernon
didn
seem
hear
her
Exactly
what
was
looking
for
none
them
knew
drove
them
into
the
middle
forest
got
out
looked
around
shook
his
head
got
back
the
car
and
off
they
went
again
The
same
thing
happened
the
middle
plowed
field
halfway
across
suspension
bridge
and
the
top
multilevel
parking
garage
Daddy
gone
mad
hasn
Dudley
asked
Aunt
Petunia
dully
late
that
afternoon
Uncle
Vernon
had
parked
the
coast
locked
them
all
inside
the
car
and
disappeared
started
rain
Great
drops
beat
the
roof
the
car
Dud
ley
sniveled
Monday
told
his
mother
The
Great
Humberto
tonight
want
stay
somewhere
with
television
Monday
This
reminded
Harry
something
was
Monday
and
you
could
usually
count
Dudley
know
the
days
the
week
because
television
then
tomorrow
Tuesday
was
Harry
eleventh
birthday
course
his
birthdays
were
never
exactly
fun
last
year
the
Dursleys
had
given
him
coat
hanger
and
pair
Uncle
Vernon
old
socks
Still
you
weren
eleven
every
day
Uncle
Vernon
was
back
and
was
smiling
was
also
carrying
long
thin
package
and
didn
answer
Aunt
Petunia
when
she
asked
what
bought
Found
the
perfect
place
said
Come
Everyone
out
was
very
cold
outside
the
car
Uncle
Vernon
was
pointing
what
looked
like
large
rock
way
out
sea
Perched
top
the
rock
was
the
most
miserable
little
shack
you
could
imagine
One
thing
was
certain
there
was
television
there
Storm
forecast
for
tonight
said
Uncle
Vernon
gleefully
clapping
his
hands
together
And
this
gentleman
kindly
agreed
lend
his
boat
toothless
old
man
came
ambling
them
pointing
with
rather
wicked
grin
old
rowboat
bobbing
the
iron
gray
water
below
them
already
got
some
rations
said
Uncle
Vernon
all
aboard
was
freezing
the
boat
Icy
sea
spray
and
rain
crept
down
their
necks
and
chilly
wind
whipped
their
faces
After
what
seemed
like
hours
they
reached
the
rock
where
Uncle
Vernon
slipping
and
sliding
led
the
way
the
broken
down
house
The
inside
was
horrible
smelled
strongly
seaweed
the
wind
whistled
through
the
gaps
the
wooden
walls
and
the
fireplace
was
damp
and
empty
There
were
only
two
rooms
Uncle
Vernon
rations
turned
out
bag
chips
each
and
four
bananas
tried
start
fire
but
the
empty
chip
bags
just
smoked
and
shriveled
Could
with
some
those
letters
now
said
cheerfully
was
very
good
mood
Obviously
thought
nobody
stood
chance
reaching
them
here
storm
deliver
mail
Harry
privately
agreed
though
the
thought
didn
cheer
him
all
night
fell
the
promised
storm
blew
around
them
Spray
from
the
high
waves
splattered
the
walls
the
hut
and
fierce
wind
rattled
the
filthy
windows
Aunt
Petunia
found
few
moldy
blankets
the
second
room
and
made
bed
for
Dudley
the
moth
eaten
sofa
She
and
Uncle
Vernon
went
off
the
lumpy
bed
next
door
and
Harry
was
left
find
the
softest
bit
floor
could
and
curl
under
the
thinnest
most
ragged
blanket
The
storm
raged
more
and
more
ferociously
the
night
went
Harry
couldn
sleep
shivered
and
turned
over
trying
get
comfortable
his
stomach
rumbling
with
hunger
Dudley
snores
were
drowned
the
low
rolls
thunder
that
started
near
midnight
The
lighted
dial
Dudley
watch
which
was
dangling
over
the
edge
the
sofa
his
fat
wrist
told
Harry
eleven
ten
minutes
time
lay
and
watched
his
birthday
tick
nearer
wondering
the
Dursleys
would
remember
all
wondering
where
the
letter
writer
was
now
Five
minutes
Harry
heard
something
creak
outside
hoped
the
roof
wasn
going
fall
although
might
warmer
did
Four
minutes
Maybe
the
house
Privet
Drive
would
full
letters
when
they
got
back
that
able
steal
one
somehow
Three
minutes
Was
that
the
sea
slapping
hard
the
rock
like
that
And
two
minutes
what
was
that
funny
crunching
noise
Was
the
rock
crumbling
into
the
sea
One
minute
and
eleven
Thirty
seconds
twenty
ten
nine
maybe
wake
Dudley
just
annoy
him
three
two
one
BOOM
The
whole
shack
shivered
and
Harry
sat
bolt
upright
staring
the
door
Someone
was
outside
knocking
come
CHAPTER
FOUR
THE
KEEPER
THE
KEYS
BOOM
They
knocked
again
Dudley
jerked
awake
Where
the
cannon
said
stupidly
There
was
crash
behind
them
and
Uncle
Vernon
came
skidding
into
the
room
was
holding
rifle
his
hands
now
they
knew
what
had
been
the
long
thin
package
had
brought
with
them
Who
there
shouted
warn
you
armed
There
was
pause
Then
SMASH
The
door
was
hit
with
such
force
that
swung
clean
off
its
hinges
and
with
deafening
crash
landed
flat
the
floor
giant
man
was
standing
the
doorway
His
face
was
almost
completely
hidden
long
shaggy
mane
hair
and
wild
tangled
beard
but
you
could
make
out
his
eyes
glinting
like
black
beetles
under
all
the
hair
The
giant
squeezed
his
way
into
the
hut
stooping
that
his
head
just
brushed
the
ceiling
bent
down
picked
the
door
and
fitted
easily
back
into
its
frame
The
noise
the
storm
outside
dropped
little
turned
look
them
all
Couldn
make
cup
tea
could
yeh
not
been
easy
journey
strode
over
the
sofa
where
Dudley
sat
frozen
with
fear
Budge

said
the
stranger
Dudley
squeaked
and
ran
hide
behind
his
mother
who
was
crouching
terrified
behind
Uncle
Vernon
here
Harry
said
the
giant
Harry
looked
into
the
fierce
wild
shadowy
face
and
saw
that
the
beetle
eyes
were
crinkled
smile
Las

was
only

said
the
giant
Yeh

the

sofa
jerked
the
gun
out
Uncle
Vernon
hands
bent
into
knot
easily
had
been
made
rubber
and
threw
into
corner
the
room
Uncle
Vernon
made
another
funny
noise
like
mouse
being
trodden
Anyway
Harry
said
the
giant
turning
his
back
the
Dursleys
very
happy

From
inside
pocket
his
black
overcoat
pulled
slightly
squashed
box
Harry
opened
with
trembling
fingers
Inside
was
large
sticky
chocolate
cake
with
Happy
Birthday
Harry
written
green
icing
Harry
looked
the
giant
meant
say
thank
you
but
the
words
got
lost
the
way
his
mouth
and
what
said
instead
was
Who

The
giant
chuckled
True

Rubeus
Hagrid
Keeper
Keys
and
Grounds
Hogwarts
held
out
enormous
hand
and
shook
Harry
whole
arm
What

tea
then
said
rubbing
his
hands
together
not
say
ter
summat
stronger
yeh
got
mind
His
eyes
fell
the
empty
grate
with
the
shriveled
chip
bags
and
snorted
bent
down
over
the
fireplace
they
couldn
see
what
was
doing
but
when
drew
back
second
later
there
was
roaring
fire
there
filled
the
whole
damp
hut
with
flickering
light
and
Harry
felt
the
warmth
wash
over
him
though
sunk
into
hot
bath
The
giant
sat
back
down
the
sofa
which
sagged
under
his
weight
and
began
taking
all
sorts
things
out
the
pockets
his
coat
copper
kettle
squashy
package
sausages
poker
teapot
several
chipped
mugs
and
bottle
some
amber
liquid
that
took
swig
from
before
starting
make
tea
Soon
the
hut
was
full
the
sound
and
smell
sizzling
sausage
Nobody
said
thing
while
the
giant
was
working
but
slid
the
first
six
fat
juicy
slightly
burnt
sausages
from
the
poker
Dudley
fidgeted
little
Uncle
Vernon
said
sharply
Don

Dudley
The
giant
chuckled
darkly
Yet

passed
the
sausages
Harry
who
was
hungry
had
never
tasted
anything
wonderful
but
still
couldn
take
his
eyes
off
the
giant
Finally
nobody
seemed
about
explain
anything
said
sorry
but
still
don
really
know
who
you
are
The
giant
took
gulp
tea
and
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
his
hand
Call

Now

The
Dursleys

wall

the
Dursleys
that

What

Hagrid
looked
was
about

DURSLEY

Uncle

Uncle

Hagrid

Halloween
ten

You

Hagrid
suddenly
pulled
out
very
dirty
spotted
handkerchief
and
blew

McKinnons
the
Bones

Prewetts
you

only
baby

Something
very
painful
was
going
Harry
mind
Hagrid
story
came
close
saw
again
the
blinding
flash
green
light
more
clearly
than
had
ever
remembered
before
and
remembered
something
else
for
the
first
time
his
life
high
cold
cruel
laugh
Hagrid
was
watching
him
sadly
Took
yeh
from
the
ruined
house
myself
Dumbledore
orders
Brought
yeh
ter
this
lot
Load
old
tosh
said
Uncle
Vernon
Harry
jumped
had
almost
forgotten
that
the
Dursleys
were
there
Uncle
Vernon
certainly
seemed
have
got
back
his
courage
was
glaring
Hagrid
and
his
fists
were
clenched
Now
you
listen
here
boy
snarled
accept
there
something
strange
about
you
probably
nothing
good
beating
wouldn
have
cured
and
for
all
this
about
your
parents
well
they
were
weirdos
denying
and
the
world
better
off
without
them
opinion
asked
for
all
they
got
getting
mixed
with
these
wizarding
types
just
what
expected
always
knew
they
come
sticky
end
But
that
moment
Hagrid
leapt
from
the
sofa
and
drew
battered
pink
umbrella
from
inside
his
coat
Pointing
this
Uncle
Vernon
like
sword
said
warning
you
Dursley
warning
you
one
more
word
danger
being
speared
the
end
umbrella
bearded
giant
Uncle
Vernon
courage
failed
again
flattened
himself
against
the
wall
and
fell
silent
That
better
said
Hagrid
breathing
heavily
and
sitting
back
down
the
sofa
which
this
time
sagged
right
down
the
floor
Harry
meanwhile
still
had
questions
ask
hundreds
them
But
what
happened
Vol
sorry
mean
You
Know
Who
Good
question
Harry
Disappeared
Vanished
Same
night
tried
ter
kill
you
Makes

Too

Harry
There

but
somethin
about

stumped
him
all
right
Hagrid
looked
Harry
with
warmth
and
respect
blazing
his
eyes
but
Harry
instead
feeling
pleased
and
proud
felt
quite
sure
there
had
been
horrible
mistake
wizard
Him
How
could
possibly
spent
his
life
being
clouted
Dudley
and
bullied
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
was
really
wizard
why
hadn
they
been
turned
into
warty
toads
every
time
they
tried
lock
him
his
cupboard
once
defeated
the
greatest
sorcerer
the
world
how
come
Dudley
had
always
been
able
kick
him
around
like

Hagrid
said
quietly
think
you
must
have
made
mistake
don
think
can
wizard
his
surprise
Hagrid
chuckled
Not
wizard
Never
made
things
happen
when
you
was
scared
angry
Harry
looked
into
the
fire
Now
came
think
about
every
odd
thing
that
had
ever
made
his
aunt
and
uncle
furious
with
him
had
happened
when
Harry
had
been
upset
angry
chased
Dudley
gang
had
somehow
found
himself
out
their
reach
dreading
going
school
with
that
ridiculous
haircut
managed
make
grow
back
and
the
very
last
time
Dudley
had
hit
him
hadn
got
his
revenge
without
even
realizing
was
doing
Hadn
set
boa
constrictor
him
Harry
looked
back
Hagrid
smiling
and
saw
that
Hagrid
was
positively
beaming
him
See

When

There

noise
And

But

Tap

All

Harry
mumbled
getting

and
Hagrid
heavy
coat
fell
off
him
The
hut
was
full
sunlight
the
storm
was
over
Hagrid
himself
was
asleep
the
collapsed
sofa
and
there
was
owl
rapping
its
claw
the
window
newspaper
held
its
beak
Harry
scrambled
his
feet
happy
felt
though
large
balloon
was
swelling
inside
him
went
straight
the
window
and
jerked
open
The
owl
swooped
and
dropped
the
newspaper
top
Hagrid
who
didn
wake
The
owl
then
fluttered
onto
the
floor
and
began
attack
Hagrid
coat
Don
that
Harry
tried
wave
the
owl
out
the
way
but
snapped
its
beak
fiercely
him
and
carried
savaging
the
coat
Hagrid
said
Harry
loudly
There

Hagrid
grunted
into
the
sofa
What

humbugs
teabags
finally
Harry
pulled
out
handful
strange
looking
coins
Give

Knuts
said
Hagrid
sleepily
Knuts
The
little
bronze
ones
Harry
counted
out
five
little
bronze
coins
and
the
owl
held
out
his
leg
Harry
could
put
the
money
into
small
leather
pouch
tied
Then
flew
off
through
the
open
window
Hagrid
yawned
loudly
sat
and
stretched
Best

Harry
was
turning
over
the
wizard
coins
and
looking
them
had
just
thought
something
that
made
him
feel
though
the
happy
balloon
inside
him
had
got
puncture
Hagrid
said
Hagrid

Hagrid

Harry
followed
Hagrid
out
onto
the
rock
The
sky
was
quite
clear
now
and
the
sea
gleamed
the
sunlight
The
boat
Uncle
Vernon
had
hired

still
there
with
lot
water

bottom
after
the
storm
How

Harry
eager

Hagrid

twice
the
side

boat
and
they
sped
off
toward
land
Why

Harry
asked
Spells

Hagrid

London
Harry
wondered
aloud
yeh
know
where
said
Hagrid
Harry
had
never
been
London
before
Although
Hagrid
seemed
know
where
was
going
was
obviously
not
used
getting
there
ordinary
way
got
stuck
the
ticket
barrier
the
Underground
and
complained
loudly
that
the
seats
were
too
small
and
the
trains
too
slow
don
know
how
the
Muggles
manage
without
magic
said
they
climbed
broken
down
escalator
that
led
bustling
road
lined
with
shops
Hagrid
was
huge
that
parted
the
crowd
easily
all
Harry
had
was
keep
close
behind
him
They
passed
book
shops
and
music
stores
hamburger
restaurants
and
cinemas
but
nowhere
that
looked
could
sell
you
magic
wand
This
was
just
ordinary
street
full
ordinary
people
Could
there
really
piles
wizard
gold
buried
miles
beneath
them
Were
there
really
shops
that
sold
spell
books
and
broomsticks
Might
this
not
all
some
huge
joke
that
the
Dursleys
had
cooked
Harry
hadn
known
that
the
Dursleys
had
sense
humor
might
have
thought
yet
somehow
even
though
everything
Hagrid
had
told
him
far
was
unbelievable
Harry
couldn
help
trusting
him
This
said
Hagrid
coming
halt
the
Leaky
Cauldron
famous
place
was
tiny
grubby
looking
pub
Hagrid
hadn
pointed
out
Harry
wouldn
have
noticed
was
there
The
people
hurrying
didn
glance
Their
eyes
slid
from
the
big
book
shop
one
side
the
record
shop
the
other
they
couldn
see
the
Leaky
Cauldron
all
fact
Harry
had
the
most
peculiar
feeling
that
only
and
Hagrid
could
see
Before
could
mention
this
Hagrid
had
steered
him
inside
For
famous
place
was
very
dark
and
shabby
few
old
women
were
sitting
corner
drinking
tiny
glasses
sherry
One
them
was
smoking
long
pipe
little
man
top
hat
was
talking
the
old
bartender
who
was
quite
bald
and
looked
like
toothless
walnut
The
low
buzz
chatter
stopped
when
they
walked
Everyone
seemed
know
Hagrid
they
waved
and
smiled
him
and
the
bartender
reached
for
glass
saying
The
usual
Hagrid
Can
Tom
Hogwarts
business
said
Hagrid
clapping
his
great
hand
Harry
shoulder
and
making
Harry
knees
buckle
Good
Lord
said
the
bartender
peering
Harry
this
can
this
The
Leaky
Cauldron
had
suddenly
gone
completely
still
and
silent
Bless
soul
whispered
the
old
bartender
Harry
Potter
what
honor
hurried
out
from
behind
the
bar
rushed
toward
Harry
and
seized
his
hand
tears
his
eyes
Welcome
back
Potter
welcome
back
Harry
didn
know
what
say
Everyone
was
looking
him
The
old
woman
with
the
pipe
was
puffing
without
realizing
had
gone
out
Hagrid
was
beaming
Then
there
was
great
scraping
chairs
and
the
next
moment
Harry
found
himself
shaking
hands
with
everyone
the
Leaky
Cauldron
Doris
Crockford
Potter
can
believe
meeting
you
last
proud
Potter
just

Always

Harry
Dedalus
Diggle
top
hat
fell
off
his
excitement
You

once
shop

cried
Dedalus
Diggle
looking
around
everyone
Did
you
hear
that
remembers
Harry
shook
hands
again
and
again
Doris
Crockford
kept
coming
back
for
more
pale
young
man
made
his
way
forward
very
nervously
One
his
eyes
was
twitching
Professor
Quirrell
said
Hagrid
Harry

nervously

looked
terrified
the
very
thought
But
the
others
wouldn
let
Professor
Quirrell
keep
Harry
himself
took
almost
ten
minutes
get
away
from
them
all
last
Hagrid
managed
make
himself
heard
over
the
babble
Must
get
lots
ter
buy
Come
Harry
Doris
Crockford
shook
Harry
hand
one
last
time
and
Hagrid
led
them
through
the
bar
and
out
into
small
walled
courtyard
where
there
was
nothing
but
trash
can
and
few
weeds
Hagrid
grinned
Harry
Told

Poor

Brilliant

They

Black
Forest
and
there
was
nasty

since
Scared
the

now
where

Vampires
Hags
Harry
head
was
swimming
Hagrid
meanwhile
was
counting
bricks
the
wall
above
the
trash
can
Three
two
across
muttered
Right
stand
back
Harry
tapped
the
wall
three
times
with
the
point
his
umbrella
The
brick
had
touched
quivered
wriggled
the
middle
small
hole
appeared
grew
wider
and
wider
second
later
they
were
facing
archway
large
enough
even
for
Hagrid
archway
onto
cobbled
street
that
twisted
and
turned
out
sight
Welcome
said
Hagrid
Diagon
Alley
grinned
Harry
amazement
They
stepped
through
the
archway
Harry
looked
quickly
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
the
archway
shrink
instantly
back
into
solid
wall
The
sun
shone
brightly
stack
cauldrons
outside
the
nearest
shop
Cauldrons
All

Self
Stirring
Collapsible
said
sign
hanging
over
them
Yeah

said
Hagrid
but
gotta
get
yer
money
first
Harry
wished
had
about
eight
more
eyes
turned
his
head
every
direction
they
walked
the
street
trying
look
everything
once
the
shops
the
things
outside
them
the
people
doing
their
shopping
plump
woman
outside
Apothecary
was
shaking
her
head
they
passed
saying
Dragon

Sickles

they
mad
low
soft
hooting
came
from
dark
shop
with
sign
saying
Eeylops
Owl
Emporium
Tawny
Screech
Barn
Brown
and
Snowy
Several
boys
about
Harry
age
had
their
noses
pressed
against
window
with
broomsticks
Look
Harry
heard
one
them
say
the
new
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
fastest
ever
There
were
shops
selling
robes
shops
selling
telescopes
and
strange
silver
instruments
Harry
had
never

with

bat
spleens
and
eels
eyes
tottering
piles
spell
books
quills
and
rolls
parchment
potion
bottles
globes
the
moon
Gringotts
said
Hagrid
They
had
reached
snowy
white
building
that
towered
over
the
other
little
shops
Standing
beside
its
burnished
bronze
doors
wearing
uniform
scarlet
and
gold
was
Yeah
that
goblin
said
Hagrid
quietly
they
walked
the
white
stone
steps
toward
him
The
goblin
was
about
head
shorter
than
Harry
had
swarthy
clever
face
pointed
beard
and
Harry
noticed
very
long
fingers
and
feet
bowed
they
walked
inside
Now
they
were
facing
second
pair
doors
silver
this
time
with
words
engraved
upon
them
Enter
stranger
but
take
heed
what
awaits
the
sin
greed
For
those
who
take
but
not
earn
Must
pay
most
dearly
their
turn

never

Thief

have
been
warned
beware
finding
more
than
treasure
there
Like
said
Yeh
mad
ter
try
rob
said
Hagrid
pair
goblins
bowed
them
through
the
silver
doors
and
they
were
vast
marble
hall
About
hundred
more
goblins
were
sitting
high
stools
behind
long
counter
scribbling
large
ledgers
weighing
coins
brass
scales
examining
precious
stones
through
eyeglasses
There
were
too
many
doors
count
leading
off
the
hall
and
yet
more
goblins
were
showing
people
and
out
these
Hagrid
and
Harry
made
for
the
counter
Morning
said
Hagrid
free
goblin
come
ter
take
some
money
outta
Harry
Potter
safe
You

his
key
Sir
Got

somewhere
said
Hagrid
and
started
emptying
his
pockets
onto
the
counter
scattering
handful
moldy
dog
biscuits
over
the
goblin
book
numbers
The
goblin
wrinkled
his
nose
Harry
watched
the
goblin
their
right
weighing
pile
rubies
big
glowing
coals
Got
said
Hagrid
last
holding
tiny
golden
key
The
goblin
looked
closely
That
seems
order
also
got
letter
here
from
Professor
Dumbledore
said
Hagrid
importantly
throwing
out
his
chest
about
the
YouKnow
What
vault
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
The
goblin
read
the
letter
carefully
Very
well
said
handing
back
Hagrid
will
have
Someone
take
you
down
both
vaults
Griphook
Griphook
was
yet
another
goblin
Once
Hagrid
had
crammed
all
the
dog
biscuits
back
inside
his
pockets
and
Harry
followed
Griphook
toward
one
the
doors
leading
off
the
hall
What
the
You
Know
What
vault
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
Harry
asked
Can
tell
yeh
that
said
Hagrid
mysteriously
Very
secret
Hogwarts
business
Dumbledore
trusted
More
job
worth
ter
tell
yeh
that
Griphook
held
the
door
open
for
them
Harry
who
had
expected
more
marble
was
surprised
They
were
narrow
stone
passageway
lit
with
flaming
torches
sloped
steeply
downward
and
there
were
little
railway
tracks
the
floor
Griphook
whistled
and
small
cart
came
hurtling
the
tracks
toward
them
They
climbed
Hagrid
with
some
difficulty
and
were
off
first
they
just
hurtled
through
maze
twisting
passages
Harry
tried
remember
left
right
right
left
middle
fork
right
left
but
was
impossible
The
rattling
cart
seemed
know
its
own
way
because
Griphook
wasn
steering
Harry
eyes
stung
the
cold
air
rushed
past
them
but
kept
them
wide
open
Once
thought
saw
burst
fire
the
end
passage
and
twisted
around
see
was
dragon
but
too
late
they
plunged
even
deeper
passing
underground
lake
where
huge
stalactites
and
stalagmites
grew
from
the
ceiling
and
floor
never
know
Harry
called
Hagrid
over
the
noise
the
cart
what
the
difference
between
stalagmite
and
stalactite
Stalagmite
got
said
Hagrid
don
ask
questions
just
now
think
gonna
sick
did
look
very
green
and
when
the
cart
stopped
last
beside
small
door
the
passage
wall
Hagrid
got
out
and
had
lean
against
the
wall
stop
his
knees
from
trembling
Griphook
unlocked
the
door
lot
green
smoke
came
billowing
out
and
cleared
Harry
gasped
Inside
were
mounds
gold
coins
Columns
silver
Heaps
little
bronze
Knuts
All
yours
smiled
Hagrid
All
Harry
was
incredible
The
Dursleys
couldn
have
known
about
this
they
have
had
from
him
faster
than
blinking
How
often
had
they
complained
how
much
Harry
cost
them
keep
And
all
the
time
there
had
been
small
fortune
belonging
him
buried
deep
under
London
Hagrid
helped
Harry
pile
some
into
bag
The
gold
ones
are
Galleons
explained
Seventeen
silver
Sickles
Galleon
and
twenty
nine
Knuts
Sickle
easy
enough
Right
that
should
enough
fer
couple
terms
keep
the
rest
safe
for
yeh
turned
Griphook
Vault
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
now
please
and
can
more
slowly
One
speed
only
said
Griphook
They
were
going
even
deeper
now
and
gathering
speed
The
air
became
colder
and
colder
they
hurtled
round
tight
corners
They
went
rattling
over
underground
ravine
and
Harry
leaned
over
the
side
try
see
what
was
down
the
dark
bottom
but
Hagrid
groaned
and
pulled
him
back
the
scruff
his
neck
Vault
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
had
keyhole
Stand
back
said
Griphook
importantly
stroked
the
door
gently
with
one
his
long
fingers
and
simply
melted
away
anyone
but
Gringotts
goblin
tried
that
they
sucked
through
the
door
and
trapped
there
said
Griphook
How
often
you
check
see
anyone
inside
Harry
asked
About
once
every
ten
years
said
Griphook
with
rather
nasty
grin
Something
really
extraordinary
had
inside
this
top
security
vault
Harry
was
sure
and
leaned
forward
eagerly
expecting
see
fabulous
jewels
the
very
least
but
first
thought
was
empty
Then
noticed
grubby
little
package
wrapped
brown
paper
lying
the
floor
Hagrid
picked
and
tucked
deep
inside
his
coat
Harry
longed
know
what
was
but
knew
better
than
ask
Come
back
this
infernal
cart
and
don
talk
the
way
back
best
keep
mouth
shut
said
Hagrid
One
wild
cart
ride
later
they
stood
blinking
the
sunlight
outside
Gringotts
Harry
didn
know
where
run
first
now
that
had
bag
full
money
didn
have
know
how
many
Galleons
there
were
pound
know
that

holding
more
money
than
had
his
whole
life
more
money
than
even
Dudley
had
ever
had
Might

said
Hagrid
nodding
toward
Madam
Malkin
Robes
for
All
Occasions
Listen
Harry

off
fer
pick
the
Leaky
Cauldron

Gringotts
carts

still
look

sick
Harry
entered
Madam
Malkin
shop
alone
feeling
nervous
Madam
Malkin
was
squat
smiling
witch
dressed
all
mauve
Hogwarts
clear
she
said
when
Harry
started
speak
Got

young

just
now

the
back
the
shop
boy
with
pale

while

long
black

Madam
Malkin
stood

next
him
slipped
long
robe
over
his
head
and
began

right
length

Harry

Dudley

Harry

said
the
boy
suddenly
nodding
toward
the
front
window
Hagrid
was
standing
there
grinning
Harry
and
pointing
two
large
ice
creams
show

But

Some

Hagrid
They

Flourish
and
Blotts
where
the
shelves
were
stacked
the
ceiling
with
books
large
paving
stones
bound
leather
books
the
size
postage
stamps
covers
silk
books
full
peculiar
symbols
and
few
books
with
nothing

Even
Dudley
who
never
read
anything
would
have
been
wild
get
his
hands
some
these
Hagrid
almost
had
drag
Harry
away
from
Curses
and
Countercurses
Bewitch

Befuddle
Your
Enemies
with
the
Latest
Revenges
Hair

Professor
Vindictus
Viridian

Dudley

that
not

Hagrid
anyway

study
before

ter
that
level
Hagrid
wouldn
let
Harry
buy
solid
gold
cauldron
either
says
pewter
yer
list
but
they
got
nice
set
scales
for
weighing
potion
ingredients
and
collapsible
brass
telescope
Then
they
visited
the
Apothecary
which
was
fascinating
enough
make
for
its
horrible
smell
mixture
bad
eggs
and
rotted
cabbages
Barrels
slimy
stuff
stood
the
floor
jars
herbs
dried
roots
and
bright
powders
lined
the
walls
bundles
feathers
strings
fangs
and
snarled
claws
hung
from
the
ceiling
While
Hagrid
asked
the
man
behind
the
counter
for
supply
some
basic
potion
ingredients
for
Harry
Harry
himself
examined
silver
unicorn
horns
twenty
one
Galleons
each
and
minuscule
glittery
black
beetle
eyes
five
Knuts
scoop
Outside
the
Apothecary
Hagrid
checked
Harry
list
again
Just
yer
wand

Harry
felt
himself
red
You

Not

All

Twenty
minutes
later
they
left
Eeylops
Owl
Emporium
which
had
been
dark
and
full
rustling
and
flickering
jewel
bright
eyes
Harry
now
carried
large
cage
that
held
beautiful
snowy
owl
fast
asleep
with
her
head
under
her
wing
couldn
stop
stammering
his
thanks
sounding
just
like
Professor
Quirrell
Don

said
Hagrid
gruffly
Don
expect

lotta
presents

Dursleys
Just
Ollivanders
left
now
only
place
fer
wands
Ollivanders
and
yeh
gotta
have
the
best
wand
magic
wand
this
was
what
Harry
had
been
really
looking
forward
The
last
shop
was
narrow
and
shabby
Peeling
gold
letters
over
the
door
read
Ollivanders
Makers
Fine
Wands
since
382
single
wand
lay
faded
purple
cushion
the
dusty
window
tinkling
bell
rang
somewhere
the
depths
the
shop
they
stepped
inside
was
tiny
place
empty
except
for
single
spindly
chair
that
Hagrid
sat
wait
Harry
felt
strangely
though
had
entered
very
strict
library
swallowed
lot
new
questions
that
had
just
occurred
him
and
looked
instead
the
thousands
narrow
boxes
piled
neatly
right
the
ceiling
For
some
reason
the
back
his
neck
prickled
The
very
dust
and
silence
here
seemed
tingle
with
some
secret
magic
Good
afternoon
said
soft
voice
Harry
jumped
Hagrid
must
have
jumped
too
because
there
was
loud
crunching
noise
and
got
quickly
off
the
spindly
chair
old
man
was
standing
before
them
his
wide
pale
eyes
shining
like
moons
through
the
gloom
the
shop
Hello
said
Harry
awkwardly
yes
said
the
man
Yes
yes
thought
seeing
you
soon
Harry
Potter
wasn
question
You
have
your
mother
eyes
seems
only
yesterday
she
was
here
herself
buying
her
first
wand
Ten
and
quarter
inches
long
swishy
made
willow
Nice
wand
for
charm
work
Ollivander
moved
closer
Harry
Harry
wished
would
blink
Those
silvery
eyes
were
bit
creepy
Your
father
the
other
hand
favored
mahogany
wand
Eleven
inches
Pliable
little
more
power
and
excellent
for
transfiguration
Well
say
your
father
favored
really
the
wand
that
chooses
the
wizard
course
Ollivander
had
come
close
that
and
Harry
were
almost
nose
nose
Harry
could
see
himself
reflected
those
misty
eyes
And
that
where
Ollivander
touched
the
lightning
scar
Harry
forehead
with
long
white
finger
sorry
say
sold
the
wand
that
did
said
softly
Thirteen
and
half
inches
Yew
Powerful
wand
very
powerful
and
the
wrong
hands
well
known
what
that
wand
was
going
out
into
the
world
shook
his
head
and
then
Harry
relief
spotted
Hagrid
Rubeus
Rubeus
Hagrid
How
nice
see
you
again
Oak
sixteen
inches
rather
bendy
wasn
was
sir
yes
said
Hagrid
Good
wand
that
one
But
suppose
they
snapped
half
when
you
got
expelled
said
Ollivander
suddenly
stern
yes
they
did
yes
said
Hagrid
shuffling
his
feet
still
got
the
pieces
though
added
brightly
But
you
don
use
them
said
Ollivander
sharply
sit
said
Hagrid
quickly
Harry
noticed
gripped
his
pink
umbrella
very
tightly
spoke
Hmmm
said
Ollivander
giving
Hagrid
piercing
look
Well
now
Potter
Let
see
pulled
long
tape
measure
with
silver
markings
out
his
pocket
Which
your
wand
arm
well
right
handed
said
Harry
Hold
out
your
arm
That
measured
Harry
from
shoulder
finger
then
wrist
elbow
shoulder
floor
knee
armpit
and
round
his
head
measured
said
Every
Ollivander
wand
has
core
powerful
magical
substance
Potter
use
unicorn
hairs
phoenix
tail
feathers
and
the
heartstrings
dragons
two
Ollivander
wands
are
the
same
just
two
unicorns
dragons
phoenixes
are
quite
the
same
And
course
you
will
never
get
such
good
results
with
another
wizard
wand
Harry
suddenly
realized
that
the
tape
measure
which
was
measuring
between
his
nostrils
was
doing
this
its
own
Ollivander
was
flitting
around
the
shelves
taking
down
boxes
That
will
said
and
the
tape
measure
crumpled
into
heap
the
floor
Right
then
Potter
Try
this
one
Beechwood
and
dragon
heartstring
Nine
inches
Nice
and
flexible
just
take
and
give
wave
Harry
took
the
wand
and
feeling
foolish
waved
around
bit
but
Ollivander
snatched
out
his
hand
almost
once
Maple
and
phoenix
feather
Seven
inches
Quite
whippy
Try
Harry
tried
but
had
hardly
raised
the
wand
when
too
was
snatched
back
Ollivander
here
ebony
and
unicorn
hair
eight
and
half
inches
springy
try
out
Harry
tried
And
tried
had
idea
what
Ollivander
was
waiting
for
The
pile
tried
wands
was
mounting
higher
and
higher
the
spindly
chair
but
the
more
wands
Ollivander
pulled
from
the
shelves
the
happier
seemed
become
Tricky
customer
Not
worry
find
the
perfect
match
here
somewhere
wonder
now
yes
why
not
unusual
combination
holly
and
phoenix
feather
eleven
inches
nice
and
supple
Harry
took
the
wand
felt
sudden
warmth
his
fingers
raised
the
wand
above
his
head
brought
swishing
down
through
the
dusty
air
and
stream
red
and
gold
sparks
shot
from
the
end
like
firework
throwing
dancing
spots
light
the
walls
Hagrid
whooped
and
clapped
and
Ollivander
cried
bravo
Yes
indeed
very
good
Well
well
well
how
curious
how
very
curious
put
Harry
wand
back
into
its
box
and
wrapped
brown
paper
still
muttering
Curious
curious
Sorry
said
Harry
but
what
curious
Ollivander
fixed
Harry
with
his
pale
stare
remember
every
wand
ever
sold
Potter
Every
single
wand
happens
that
the
phoenix
whose
tail
feather
your
wand
gave
another
feather
just
one
other
very
curious
indeed
that
you
should
destined
for
this
wand
when
its
brother
why
its
brother
gave
you
that
scar
Harry
swallowed
Yes
thirteen
and
half
inches
Yew
Curious
indeed
how
these
things
happen
The
wand
chooses
the
wizard
remember
think
must
expect
great
things
from
you
Potter
After
all
Who
Must
Not
Named
did
great
things
terrible
yes
but
great
Harry
shivered
wasn
sure
liked
Ollivander
too
much
paid
seven
gold
Galleons
for
his
wand
and
Ollivander
bowed
them
from
his
shop
The
late
afternoon
sun
hung
low
the
sky
Harry
and
Hagrid
made
their
way
back
down
Diagon
Alley
back
through
the
wall
back
through
the
Leaky
Cauldron
now
empty
Harry
didn
speak
all
they
walked
down
the
road
didn
even
notice
how
much
people
were
gawking
them
the
Underground
laden
they
were
with
all
their
funny
shaped
packages
with
the
snowy
owl
asleep
its
cage
Harry
lap
another
escalator
out
into
Paddington
station
Harry
only
realized
where
they
were
when
Hagrid
tapped
him
the
shoulder
Got

bought
Harry
hamburger
and
they
sat
down

seats

them
Harry
kept
looking
around
Everything

strange
somehow
You

Harry
Yer

quiet
said
Hagrid
Harry
wasn
sure
could
explain
just
had
the
best
birthday
his
life
and
yet
chewed
his
hamburger
trying
find
the
words
Everyone

All
those
people
the
Leaky
Cauldron
Professor
Quirrell
Ollivander
but

and
can
even
remember
what

for
don
know
what
happened
when
Vol
sorry
mean
the
night
parents
died
Hagrid
leaned
across
the
table
Behind
the
wild
beard
and
eyebrows
wore
very
kind
smile
Don

Harry
You

The

out
the
station
Harry
wanted
watch
Hagrid
until
was
out
sight
rose
his
seat
and
pressed
his
nose
against
the
window
but
blinked
and
Hagrid
had
gone
CHAPTER
SIX
THE
JOURNEY
FROM
PLATFORM
NINE
AND
THREE
QUARTERS
Harry
last
month
with
the
Dursleys
wasn
fun
True
Dudley
was
now
scared
Harry
wouldn
stay
the
same
room
while
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
didn
shut
Harry
his
cupboard
force
him
anything
shout
him
fact
they
didn
speak
him
all
Half
terrified
half
furious
they
acted
though
any
chair
with
Harry
were
empty
Although
this
was
improvement
many
ways
did
become
bit
depressing
after
while
Harry
kept
his
room
with
his
new
owl
for
company
had
decided
call
her
Hedwig
name
had
found
History
Magic
His
school
books
were
very
interesting
lay
his
bed
reading
late
into
the
night
Hedwig
swooping
and
out
the
open
window
she
pleased
was
lucky
that
Aunt
Petunia
didn
come
vacuum
anymore
because
Hedwig
kept
bringing
back
dead
mice
Every
night
before
went
sleep
Harry
ticked
off
another
day
the
piece
paper
had
pinned
the
wall
counting
down
September
the
first
the
last
day
August
thought
better
speak
his
aunt
and
uncle
about
getting
King
Cross
station
the
next
day
went
down
the
living
room
where
they
were
watching
quiz
show
television
cleared
his
throat
let
them
know
was
there
and
Dudley
screamed
and
ran
from
the
room
Uncle
Vernon
Uncle
Vernon
grunted
show
was
listening
need
King
Cross
tomorrow
Hogwarts
Uncle
Vernon
grunted
again
Would

right

gave
lift
Grunt
Harry
supposed
that
meant
yes
Thank

was
about
back
upstairs
when
Uncle
Vernon
actually
spoke
Funny

wizards

train
Magic
carpets

Harry
didn
say
anything
Where

school

said
Harry
realizing
this
for
the
first
time
pulled
the
ticket
Hagrid
had
given
him
out
his
pocket
just
take
the
train
from
platform
nine
and
three
quarters
eleven
clock
read
His
aunt
and
uncle
stared
Platform

quarters

said
Uncle
Vernon
There

Uncle

howling
mad
the
lot
them

All

Why

Harry
asked
trying
keep
things
friendly
Taking
Dudley
the
hospital
growled
Uncle
Vernon
Got
have
that
ruddy
tail
removed
before

Smeltings
Harry
woke
five
clock
the
next
morning
and
was
too
excited
and
nervous
back
sleep
got
and
pulled
his
jeans
because
didn
want
walk
into
the
station
his
wizard
robes
change
the
train
checked
his
Hogwarts
list
yet
again
make
sure
had
everything
needed
saw
that
Hedwig
was
shut
safely
her
cage
and
then
paced
the
room
waiting
for
the
Dursleys
get
Two
hours
later
Harry
huge
heavy
trunk
had
been
loaded
into
the
Dursleys
car
Aunt
Petunia
had
talked
Dudley
into
sitting
next
Harry
and
they
had
set
off
They
reached
King
Cross
half
past
ten
Uncle
Vernon
dumped
Harry
trunk
onto
cart
and
wheeled
into
the
station
for
him
Harry
thought
this
was
strangely
kind
until
Uncle
Vernon
stopped
dead
facing
the
platforms
with
nasty
grin
his
face
Well
there
you
are
boy
Platform
nine
platform
ten
Your
platform
should
somewhere
the
middle
but
they
don
seem
have
built
yet
they
was
quite
right
course
There
was
big
plastic
number
nine
over
one
platform
and
big
plastic
number
ten
over
the
one
next
and
the
middle
nothing
all
Have
good
term
said
Uncle
Vernon
with
even
nastier
smile
left
without
another
word
Harry
turned
and
saw
the
Dursleys
drive
away
All
three
them
were
laughing
Harry
mouth
went
rather
dry
What
earth
was
going
was
starting
attract
lot
funny
looks
because
Hedwig
have
ask
someone
stopped
passing
guard
but
didn
dare
mention
platform
nine
and
three
quarters
The
guard
had
never
heard
Hogwarts
and
when
Harry
couldn
even
tell
him
what
part
the
country
was
started
get
annoyed
though
Harry
was
being
stupid
purpose
Getting
desperate
Harry
asked
for
the
train
that
left
eleven
clock
but
the
guard
said
there
wasn
one
the
end
the
guard
strode
away
muttering
about
time
wasters
Harry
was
now
trying
hard
not
panic
According
the
large
clock
over
the
arrivals
board
had
ten

their

half
laughing
half

keep
with
the
train
until

too
much
speed
then
she
fell
back
and
waved
Harry
watched
the
girl
and
her
mother
disappear
the
train
rounded
the
corner
Houses
flashed
past
the
window
Harry
felt
great
leap
excitement
didn
know
what
was
going
but
had
better
than
what
was
leaving
behind
The
door
the
compartment
slid
open
and
the
youngest
redheaded
boy
came
Anyone

pointing
the
seat
opposite
Harry
Everywhere

Harry
shook
his
head
and
the

Harry
and
then
looked
quickly
out
the
window
pretending

looked
Harry
saw
still
had

Ron

pointed
Harry
forehead
Harry
pulled
back
his
bangs
show
the
lightning
scar
Ron
stared
that
where
You

Yes
said
Harry
but
can
remember
Nothing
said
Ron
eagerly
Well

green
light
but
nothing

Wow
said
Ron
sat
and
stared
Harry
for
few
moments
then
though
had
suddenly
realized
what
was
doing
looked
quickly
out
the
window
again
Are
all
your
family
wizards
asked
Harry
who
found
Ron
just
interesting
Ron
found
him
Yes

said
Ron
think
Mom

who
accountant
but
never

you
must

The
Weasleys
were
clearly
one
those
old
wizarding
families
the
pale

said
Ron
What

Wish

Now
Percy

but
they
still

and
everyone
thinks

Everyone
expects
well
the
others
but
big

because

first
You

either
with
five
brothers
got
Bill

Charlie

and
Percy

Ron
reached
inside
his
jacket
and
pulled
out
fat
gray
rat
which
was
asleep
His
name
Scabbers
and
useless
hardly
ever

Percy
got

for

but
they
couldn
aff
mean

Ron
ears
went
pink
seemed
think
said
too
much
because
went
back
staring
out
the
window
Harry
didn
think
there
was
anything
wrong
with
not
being
able
afford
owl
After
all
never
had
any
money
his
life
until
month
ago
and
told
Ron
all
about
having
wear
Dudley
old
clothes
and
never
getting
proper
birthday
presents
This
seemed
cheer
Ron
and
until
Hagrid
told

know
anything
about
ing
wizard

parents
Voldemort
Ron
gasped
What

Harry

While
they
had
been
talking
the
train
had
carried
them
out
London
Now
they
were
speeding
past
fields
full
cows
and
sheep
They
were
quiet
for
time
watching
the
fields
and
lanes
flick
past
Around
half
past
twelve
there
was
great
clattering
outside
the
corridor
and
smiling
dimpled
woman
slid
back
their
door
and
said

Harry
who
hadn
had
any

feet
but
Ron

muttered

Harry
went
out
into
the
corridor

never
had

Dursleys
and

Harry

Ron
eating
their

through

Harry

Harry
asked
Ron

Ron

Harry

Ron
sounded
amazed
weird
Harry
stared
Dumbledore
sidled
back
into
the
picture
his

and
gave
him
small
smile
Ron
was
more
interested
eating
the
frogs
than
looking
the
Famous
Witches
and
Wizards
cards
but
Harry
couldn
keep
his
eyes
off
them
Soon

not

and
Morgana
but
Hengist
Woodcroft
Alberic
Grunnion
Circe
Paracelsus
and
Merlin

nibble
the

Ron
wouldn
touch
which
turned
out

The
countryside
now
flying
past
the
window
was
becoming
wilder
The
neat
fields

gone
Now
there
were
woods
twisting
rivers
and
dark
green

There

Hermione

Ron
threw
his
wand
back
into
his
trunk
Stupid

What

Harry
Gryffindor
said
Ron
Gloom
seemed
settling
him
again
Mom

Dad

Ravenclaw

but

That

You

Ron
flopped
back
into
his
seat
looking
depressed
You

bit
lighter
said
Harry
trying
take
Ron
mind
off
houses
what
your
oldest
brothers
now
that
they
left
anyway
Harry
was
wondering
what
wizard
did
once
finished
school
Charlie
Romania
studying
dragons
and
Bill
Africa
doing
something
for
Gringotts
said
Ron
Did
you
hear
about
Gringotts
been
all
over
the
Daily
Prophet
but
don
suppose
you
get
that
with
the
Muggles
someone
tried
rob
high
security
vault
Harry
stared
Really
What

them
Nothing

why

big
news
They
haven
been
caught
dad
says
must
been
powerful
Dark
wizard
get
round
Gringotts
but
they
don
think
they
took
anything
that
what
odd
Course
everyone
gets
scared
when
something
like
this
happens
case
You
Know
Who
behind
Harry
turned
this
news
over
his
mind
was
starting
get
prickle
fear
every
time
You
Know
Who
was
mentioned
supposed
this
was
all
part
entering
the
magical
world
but
had
been
lot
more
comfortable
saying
Voldemort
without
worrying
What
your
Quidditch
team
Ron
asked
don
know
any
Harry
confessed
What
Ron
looked
dumbfounded
you
wait
the
best
game
the
world
And
was
off
explaining
all
about
the
four
balls
and
the
positions
the
seven
players
describing
famous
games
been
with
his
brothers
and
the
broomstick
like
get
had
the
money
was
just
taking
Harry
through
the
finer
points
the
game
when
the
compartment
door
slid
open
yet
again
but
wasn
Neville
the
toadless
boy
Hermione
Granger
this
time
Three
boys
entered
and
Harry
recognized
the
middle
one
once
was
the
pale
boy
from
Madam
Malkin
robe
shop
was
looking
Harry
with
lot
more
interest
than
shown
back
Diagon
Alley
true
said
They
saying
all
down
the
train
that
Harry
Potter
this
compartment
you
Yes
said
Harry
was
looking
the
other
boys
Both
them
were
thickset
and
looked
extremely
mean
Standing
either
side
the
pale
boy
they
looked
like
bodyguards
this
Crabbe
and
this
Goyle
said
the
pale
boy
carelessly
noticing
where
Harry
was
looking
And
name
Malfoy
Draco
Malfoy
Ron
gave
slight
cough
which
might
have
been
hiding
snigget
Draco
Malfoy
looked
him
Think
name
funny
you
need
ask
who
you
are
father
told
all
the
Weasleys
have
red
hair
freckles
and
more
children
than
they
can
afford
turned
back
Harry
You
soon
find
out
some
wizarding
families
are
much
better
than
others
Potter
You
don
want
making
friends
with
the
wrong
sort
can
help
you
there
held
out
his
hand
shake
Harry
but
Harry
didn
take
think
can
tell
who
the
wrong
sort
are
for
myself
thanks
said
coolly
Draco
Malfoy
didn
red
but
pink
tinge
appeared
his
pale
cheeks
careful
were
you
Potter
said
slowly
Unless
you
bit
politer
you
the
same
way
your
parents
They
didn
know
what
was
good
for
them
either
You
hang
around
with
riffraff
like
the
Weasleys
and
that
Hagrid
and
rub
off
you
Both
Harry
and
Ron
stood
Say
that
again
Ron
said
his
face
red
his
hair
you
going
fight
are
you
Malfoy
sneered
Unless
you
get
out
now
said
Harry
more
bravely
than
felt
because
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
lot
bigger
than
him
Ron
But
don
feet
like
leaving
boys
eaten
all
our
food
and
you
still
seem
have
some
Goyle
reached
toward
the
Chocolate
Frogs
next
Ron
Ron
leapt
forward
but
before
much
touched
Goyle
Goyle
let
out
horrible
yell
Scabbers
the
rat
was
hanging
off
his
finger
sharp
little
teeth
sunk
deep
into
Goyle
knuckle
Crabbe
and
Malfoy
backed
away
Goyle
swung
Scabbers
round
and
round
howling
and
when
Scabbets
finally
flew
off
and
hit
the
window
all
three
them
disappeared
once
Perhaps
they
thought
there
were
more
rats
lurking
among
the
sweets
perhaps
they
heard
footsteps
because
second
later
Hermione
Granger
had
come
What
has
been
going
she
said
looking
the
sweets
all
over
the
floor
and
Ron
picking
Scabbers
his
tail
think
been
knocked
out
Ron
said
Harry
looked
closer
Scabbers
don
believe
gone
back
sleep
And
had
You
met
Malfoy
before
Harry
explained
about
their
meeting
Diagon
Alley
heard
his
family
said
Ron
darkly
They
were
some
the
first
come
back
our
side
after
You
Know
Who
disappeared
Said
they
been
bewitched
dad
doesn
believe
says
Malfoy
father
didn
need
excuse
over
the
Dark
Side
turned
Hermione
Can

you
with
something
You

hurry
and
put
your
robes
just
been

front
ask
the
conductor
and
says
nearly
there
You

You

Scabbers

not
said
Ron
scowling
her
Would
you
mind
leaving
while
change
All
right
only
came
here
because
people
outside
are
behaving
very
childishly
racing
and
down
the
corridors
said
Hermione
sniffy
voice
And
you
got
dirt
your
nose
the
way
did
you
know
Ron
glared
her
she
left
Harry
peered
out
the
window
was
getting
dark
could
see
mountains
and
forests
under
deep
purple
sky
The
train
did
seem
slowing
down
and
Ron
took
off
their
jackets
and
pulled
their
long
black
robes
Ron
were
bit
short
for
him
you
could
see
his
sneakers
underneath
them
voice
echoed
through
the
train
will
reaching
Hogwarts
five
minutes
time
Please
leave
your
luggage
the
train
will
taken
the
school
separately
Harry
stomach
lurched
with
nerves
and
Ron
saw
looked
pale
under
his
freckles
They
crammed
their
pockets
with
the
last
the
sweets
and
joined
the
crowd
thronging
the
corridor
The
train
slowed
right
down
and
finally
stopped
People
pushed
their
way
toward
the
door
and
out
tiny
dark
platform
Harry
shivered
the
cold
night
air
Then
lamp
came
bobbing
over
the
heads
the
students
and
Harry
heard
familiar
voice
Firs
years
Firs
years
over
here
All

Harry
Hagrid
big
hairy
face
beamed
over
the
sea
heads
mon
follow
any
more
firs
years
Mind
yer
step
now
Firs
years
follow
Slipping
and
stumbling
they
followed
Hagrid
down
what
seemed
steep
narrow
path
was
dark
either
side
them
that
Harry
thought
there
must
thick
trees
there
Nobody
spoke
much
Neville
the
boy
who
kept
losing
his
toad
sniffed
once
twice
all
get
yer
firs
sight
Hogwarts
sec
Hagrid
called
over
his
shoulder
jus
round
this
bend
here
There
was
loud
Oooooh
The
narrow
path
had
opened
suddenly
onto
the
edge
great
black
take
Perched
atop
high
mountain
the
other
side
its
windows
sparkling
the
starry
sky
was
vast
castle
with
many
turrets
and
towers
more
four
boat
Hagrid
called
pointing
fleet
little
boats
sitting
the
water
the
shore
Harry
and
Ron
were
followed
into
their
boat
Neville
and
Hermione
Everyone
shouted
Hagrid
who
had
boat
himself
Right
then
FORWARD
And
the
fleet
little
boats
moved
off
all
once
gliding
across
the
lake
which
was
smooth
glass
Everyone
was
silent
staring
the
great
castle
overhead
towered
over
them
they
sailed
nearer
and
nearer
the
cliff
which
stood
Heads
down
yelled
Hagrid
the
first
boats
reached
the
cliff
they
all
bent
their
heads
and
the
little
boats
carried
them
through
curtain
ivy
that
hid
wide
opening
the
cliff
face
They
were
carried
along
dark
tunnel
which
seemed
taking
them
right
underneath
the
castle
until
they
reached
kind
underground
harbor
where
they
clambered
out
onto
rocks
and
pebbles
you
there
this
your
toad
said
Hagrid
who
was
checking
the
boats
people
climbed
out
them
Trevor
cried
Neville
blissfully
holding
out
his
hands
Then
they
clambered
passageway
the
rock
after
Hagrid
lamp
coming
out
last
onto
smooth
damp
grass
right
the
shadow
the
castle
They
walked
flight

steps
and
crowded
around
the
huge
Oak
front
door
Everyone

You

toad
Hagrid
raised
gigantic
fist
and
knocked
three
times
the
castle
door
CHAPTER
SEVEN
THE
SORTING
HAT
The
door
swung
open
once
tall
black
haired
witch
emerald
green
robes
stood
there
She
had
very
stern
face
and
Harry
first
thought
was
that
this
was
not
someone
cross
The
firs
years
Professor
McGonagall
said
Hagrid
Thank
you
Hagrid
will
take
them
from
here
She
pulled
the
door
wide
The
entrance
hall
was
big
you
could
have
fit
the
whole
the
Dursleys
house
The
stone
walls
were
lit
with
flaming
torches
like
the
ones
Gringotts
the
ceiling
was
too
high
make
out
and
magnificent
marble
staircase
facing
them
led
the
upper
floors
They
followed
Professor
McGonagall
across
the
flagged
stone
floor
Harry
could
hear
the
drone
hundreds
voices
from
doorway
the
right
the
rest
the
school
must
already
here
but
Professor
McGonagall
showed
the
first
years
into
small
empty
chamber
off
the
hall
They
crowded
standing
rather
closer
together
than
they
would
usually
have
done
peering
about
nervously
Welcome
Hogwarts
said
Professor
McGonagall
The
start
term
banquet
will
begin
shortly
but
before
you
take
your
seats
the
Great
Hall
you
will

your
houses

important
ceremony
because
while
you

Hogwarts
You
will
have
classes
with
the
rest
your
house
sleep
your
house
dormitory
and
spend
free
time
your
house
common
room
The
four
houses
are
called
Gryffindor
Hufflepuff
Ravenclaw
and
Slytherin
Each
house
has
its
own
noble
history
and
each
has
produced
outstanding
witches
and
wizards
While
you
are
Hogwarts
your
triumphs
will
earn
your
house
points
while
any
rulebreaking
will
lose
house
points
the
end
the
year
the

the
most
points
awarded
the
house
cup
great
honor
hope
each
you
will
credit
whichever
house
becomes
yours
The
Sorting
Ceremony
will
take
place
few
minutes
front
the
rest
the
school
suggest
you
all
smarten
yourselves
much
you
can
while
you
are
waiting
Her
eyes
lingered
for
moment
Neville
cloak
which
was
fastened
under
his
left
ear
and
Ron
smudged
nose
Harry
nervously
tried
flatten
his
hair
shall
return
when
are
ready
for
you
said
Professor
McGonagall
Please
wait
quietly
She
left
the
chamber
Harry
swallowed
How
exactly
they
sort
into
houses
asked
Ron
Some
sort
test
think
Fred
said
hurts
lot
but
think
was
joking
Harry
heart
gave
horrible
jolt
test
front
the
whole
school
But
didn
know
any
magic
yet
what
earth
would
have
hadn
expected
something
like
this
the
moment
they
arrived
looked
around
anxiously
and
saw
that
everyone
else
looked
terrified
too
one
was
talking
much
except
Hermione
Granger
who
was
whispering
very
fast
about
all
the
spells
she
learned
and
wondering
which
one
she
need
Harry
tried
hard
not
listen
her
never
been
more
nervous
never
not
even
when
had
take
school
report
home
the
Dursleys
saying
that
somehow
turned
his
teacher
wig
blue
kept
his
eyes
fixed
the
door
Any
second
now
Professor
McGonagall
would
come
back
and
lead
him
his
doom
Then
something
happened
that
made
him
jump
about
foot
the
air
several
people
behind
him
screamed
What
the
gasped
did
the
people
around
him
About
twenty
ghosts
had
just
streamed
through
the
back
wall
Pearly
white
and
slightly
transparent
they
glided
across
the
room
talking
one
another
and
hardly
glancing
the
first
years
They
seemed
arguing
What
looked
like
fat
little
monk
was
saying
Forgive
and
forget
say
ought
give
him
second
chance
dear
Friar
haven
given
Peeves
all
the
chances
deserves
gives
all
bad
name
and
you
know
not
really
even
ghost
say
what
are
you
all
doing
here
ghost
wearing
ruff
and
tights
had
suddenly
noticed
the
first
years
Nobody
answered
New
students
said
the
Fat
Friar
smiling
around
them
About
Sorted
suppose
few
people
nodded
mutely
Hope
see
you
Hufflepuff
said
the
Friar
old
house
you
know
Move
along
now
said
sharp
voice
The
Sorting
Ceremony
about
start
Professor
McGonagall
had
returned
One
one
the
ghosts
floated
away
through
the
opposite
wall
Now
form
line
Professor
McGonagall
told
the
first
years
and
follow
Feeling
oddly
though
his
legs
had
turned
lead
Harry
got
into
line
behind
boy
with
sandy
hair
with
Ron
behind
him
and
they
walked
out
the
chamber
back
across
the
hall
and
through
pair
double
doors
into
the
Great
Hall
Harry
had
never
even
imagined
such
strange
and
splendid
place
was
lit
thousands
and
thousands
candles
that
were
floating
midair
over
four
long
tables
where
the
rest
the
students
were
sitting
These
tables
were
laid
with
glittering
golden
plates
and
goblets
the
top
the
hall
was
another
long
table
where
the
teachers
were
sitting
Professor
McGonagall
led
the
first
years
here
that
they
came
halt
line
facing
the
other
students
with
the
teachers
behind
them
The
hundreds
faces
staring
them
looked
like
pale
lanterns
the
flickering
candlelight
Dotted
here
and
there
among
the
students
the
ghosts
shone
misty
silver
Mainly
avoid
all
the
staring
eyes
Harry
looked
upward
and
saw
velvety
black
ceiling
dotted
with
stars
heard
Hermione
whisper
Its
bewitched
look
like
the
sky
outside
read
about
Hogwarts
History
was
hard
believe
there
was
ceiling
there
all
and
that
the
Great
Hall
didn
simply
open
the
heavens
Harry
quickly
looked
down
again
Professor
McGonagall
silently
placed
four
legged
stool
front
the
first
years
top
the
stool
she
put
pointed
wizard
hat
This
hat
was
patched
and
frayed
and
extremely
dirty
Aunt
Petunia
wouldn
have
let
the
house
Maybe
they
had
try
and
get
rabbit
out
Harry
thought
wildly
that
seemed
the
sort
thing
noticing
that
everyone
the
hall
was
now
staring
the
hat
stared
too
For
few
seconds
there
was
complete
silence
Then
the
hat
twitched
rip
near
the
brim
opened
wide
like
mouth
and
the
hat
began
sing
you
may
not
think
pretty
But
don
judge

The

into
applause

Ron
whispered
Harry

Fred

going
about
wrestling

Harry
smiled
weakly
Yes
trying
the
hat
was
lot
better
than
having
spell
but
did
wish
they
could
have
tried
without
everyone
watching
The
hat
seemed
asking
rather
alot
Harry
didn
feel
brave
quick
witted
any
the
moment
only
the
hat
had
mentioned
house
for
people
who
felt
bit
queasy
that
would
have
been
the
one
for
him
Professor
McGonagall
now
stepped
forward
holding
long
roll
parchment
When

with

Harry

Bulstrode
Millicent
then
became
Slytherin
Perhaps
was
Harry
imagination
after
all
heard
about
Slytherin
but
thought
they
looked
like
unpleasant
lot
was
starting
feel
definitely
sick
now
remembered
being
picked
for
teams
during
gym
his
old
school
had
always
been
last
chosen
not
because
was
good
but
because
one

Sometimes
Harry
noticed

Hermione
Hermione
almost
ran
the
stool
and
jammed
the
hat
eagerly
her
head
GRYFFINDOR
shouted
the
hat
Ron
groaned
horrible
thought
struck
Harry
horrible
thoughts
always
when
you
very
nervous
What
wasn
chosen
all
What
just
sat
there
with
the
hat
over
his
eyes
for
ages
until
Professor
McGonagall
jerked
off
his
head
and
said
there
had
obviously
been
mistake
and
better
get
back
the
train
When
Neville
Longbottom
the
boy
who
kept
losing
his
toad
was
called
fell
over
his
way
the
stool
The
hat
took
long
time
decide
with
Neville
When
finally
shouted
GRYFFINDOR
Neville
ran
off
still
wearing
and
had
jog
back
amid
gales
laughter

MacDougal
Morag
Malfoy
swaggered
forward
when
his
name
was
called
and
got
his
wish
once
the

had
barely
touched
his
head
when
screamed
SLYTHERIN

suddenly
broke
out
like
little
hissing
fires
all
over
the
hall
Potter

she
say
The
Harry

The
last
thing
Harry
saw
before
the

dropped
over
his
eyes

the
hall

Next

the

GRYFFINDOR
Harry
heard
the
hat
shout
the
last
word
the
whole
hall
took
off
the
hat
and
walked
shakily
toward
the
Gryffindor
table

twins
yelled

Potter
Harry
sat
down
opposite
the
ghost
the
ruff
seen
earlier
The
ghost
patted
his
arm
giving
Harry
the
sudden
horrible
feeling
just
plunged
into
bucket
ice
cold
water
could
see
the
High
Table
properly
now
the
end
nearest
him
sat
Hagrid
who
caught
his
eye
and
gave
him
the
thumbs
Harry
grinned
back
And
there
the
center
the
High
Table
large

sat
Albus
Dumbledore
Harry
recognized
him
once
from

the
only
thing

spotted
Professor
Quirtell
too
the
nervous
young
man
from

Harry
clapped
loudly
with
the

Ron

just
realized
how
hungry

The

ago
Albus
Dumbledore

beaming
the

Harry
piled

That

His

The
Bloody
Baron
becoming
almost
unbearable
the
Slytherin
ghost
Harry
looked
over
the
Slytherin
table
and
saw
horrible
ghost
sitting
there
with
blank
staring
eyes
gaunt
face
and
robes
stained
with
silver
blood
was
right
next
Malfoy
who
Harry
was
pleased

look
too
pleased
with
the
seating
arrangements
How

Seamus
with
great
interest

said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
delicately
When
everyone
had
eaten
much
they
could
the
remains
the
food
faded
from
the
plates
leaving
them
sparkling
clean
before

later
the

appeared
Blocks

could
think

half
said
Seamus
dad
Muggle
Mom

tell
him
she

The
others
laughed

Neville
said
Ron
Well

she
witch
said
Neville
but
the
family
thought

all
Muggle
for
ages
Great
Uncle
Algie
kept
trying
catch
off
guard
and
force
some
magic
out
pushed
off
the
end
Blackpool
pier
once
nearly
drowned
but
nothing
happened
until

Great
Uncle
Algie
came
round
for
dinner
and
was
hanging
out
upstairs
window
the
ankles
when
Great
Auntie
Enid
offered
him

and
accidentally
let
But
bounced
all
the
way
down
the
garden
and
into
the
road
They
were
all
really
pleased
Gran

crying
she
was
happy
And
you
should
have
seen
their
faces
when

they
thought

Great

Harry
other
side
Percy
Weasley
and
Hermione
were
talking
about

right
away
there

learn
particularly
interested
Transfiguration
you
know
turning
something
into
something
else
course
supposed
very
difficult
You
starting
small
just
matches
into
needles
and
that
sort
thing
Harry
who
was
starting
feel
warm
and
sleepy
looked
the
High
Table
again
Hagrid
was
drinking
deeply
from
his
goblet
Professor
McGonagall
was
talking
Professor
Dumbledore
Professor
Quirrell
his
absurd
turban
was
talking
teacher
with
greasy
black
hair
hooked
nose
and
sallow
skin
happened
very
suddenly
The
hook
nosed
teacher
looked
past
Quirrell
turban
straight
into
Harry
eyes
and
sharp
hot
pain
shot
across
the
scar
Harry
forehead
Ouch
Harry
clapped
hand
his
head
What
asked
Percy
nothing
The
pain
had
gone
quickly
had
come
Harder
shake
off
was
the
feeling
Harry
had
gotten
from
the
teacher
look
feeling
that
didn
like
Harry
all
Who
that
teacher
talking
Professor
Quirrell
asked
Percy
you
know
Quirrell
already
you
wonder
looking
nervous
that
Professor
Snape
teaches
Potions
but
doesn
want
everyone
knows
after
Quirrell
job
Knows
awful
lot
about
the
Dark
Arts
Snape
Harry
watched
Snape
for
while
but
Snape
didn
look
him
again
last
the
desserts
too
disappeared
and
Professor
Dumbledore
got
his
feet
again
The
hall
fell
silent
Ahern
just
few
more
words
now
that
are
all
fed
and
watered
have
few
start
term
notices
give
you
First
years
should
note
that
the
forest
the
grounds
forbidden
all
pupils
And
few
our
older
students
would
well
remember
that
well
Dumbledore
twinkling
eyes
flashed
the
direction
the
Weasley
twins
have
also
been
asked
Filch
the
caretaker
remind
you
all
that
magic
should
used
between
classes
the
corridors
Quidditch
trials
will
held
the
second
week
the
term
Anyone
interested
playing
for
their
house
teams
should
contact
Madam
Hooch
And
finally
must
tell
you
that
this
year
the
third
floor
corridor
the
right
hand
side
out
bounds
everyone
who
does
not
wish
die
very
painful
death
Harry
laughed
but
was
one
the
few
who
did
not
serious
muttered
Percy
Must
said
Percy
frowning
Dumbledore
odd
because
usually
gives
reason
why
not
allowed
somewhere
the
forest
full
dangerous
beasts
everyone
knows
that
think
might
have
told
prefects
least
And
now
before
bed
let
sing
the
school
song
cried
Dumbledore
Harry
noticed
that
the
other
teachers
smiles
had
become
rather
fixed
Dumbledore
gave
his
wand
little
flick
was
trying
get
fly
off
the
end
and
long
golden
ribbon
flew
out
which
rose
high
above
the
tables
and
twisted
itself
snakelike
into
words
Everyone
pick
their
favorite
tune
said
Dumbledore
and
off
And
the
school
bellowed
Hogwarts
Hogwarts
Hoggy
Warty
Hogwarts
Teach
something
please
Whether
old
and
bald
young
with
scabby
knees
Our
heads
could
with
filling
With
some
interesting
stuff
For
now
they
bare
and
full
air
Dead
flies
and
bits
fluff
teach
things
worth
knowing
Bring
back
what
forgot
just
your
best
the
rest
And
learn
until
our
brains
all
rot
Everybody
finished
the
song
different
times
last
only
the
Weasley
twins
were
left
singing
along
very
slow
funeral
march
Dumbledore
conducted
their
last
few
lines
with
his
wand
and
when
they
had
finished
was
one
those
who
clapped
loudest
music
said
wiping
his
eyes
magic
beyond
all
here
And
now
bedtime
Off
you
trot
The
Gryffindor
first
years
followed
Percy
through
the
chattering
crowds
out
the
Great
Hall
and
the
marble
staircase
Harry
legs
were
like
lead
again
but
only
because
was
tired
and
full
food
was
too
sleepy
even
surprised
that
the
people
the
portraits
along
the
corridors
whispered
and
pointed
they
passed
that
twice
Percy
led
them
through
doorways
hidden
behind
sliding
panels
and
hanging
tapestries
They
climbed
more
staircases
yawning
and
dragging
their
feet
and
Harry
was
just
wondering
how
much
farther
they
had
when
they
came
sudden
halt
bundle
walking
sticks
was
floating
midair
ahead
them
and
Percy
took
step
toward
them
they
started
throwing
themselves
him
Peeves
Percy
whispered
the
first
years
poltergeist
raised
his
voice
Peeves
show
yourself
loud
rude
sound
like
the
air
being
let
out
balloon
answered
you
want
the
Bloody
Baron
There
was
pop
and
little
man
with
wicked
dark
eyes
and
wide
mouth
appeared
floating
cross
legged
the
air
clutching
the
walking
sticks
Oooooooh
said
with
evil
cackle
Ickle
Firsties
What
fun
swooped
suddenly
them
They
all
ducked
away
Peeves
the
Baron
hear
about
this
mean
barked
Percy
Peeves
stuck
out
his
tongue
and
vanished
dropping
the
walking
sticks
Neville
head
They
heard
him
zooming
away
rattling
coats
armor
passed
You
want
watch
out
for
Peeves
said
Percy
they
set
off
again
The
Bloody
Baron
the
only
one
who
can
control
him
won
even
listen
prefects
Here
are
the
very
end
the
corridor
hung
portrait
very
fat
woman
pink
silk
dress
Password
she
said
Caput
Draconis
said
Percy
and
the
portrait
swung
forward
reveal
round
hole
the
wall
They
all
scrambled
through
Neville
needed
leg
and
found
themselves
the
Gryffindor
common
room
cozy
round
room
full
squashy
armchairs
Percy
directed
the
girls
through
one
door
their
dormitory
and
the
boys
through
another
the
top
spiral
staircase
they
were
obviously
one
the
towers
they
found
their
beds
last
five
four
posters
hung
with
deep
red
velvet
curtains
Their
trunks
had
already
been
brought
Too
tired
talk
much
they
pulled
their
pajamas
and
fell
into
bed
Great
food
isn
Ron
muttered
Harry
through
the
hangings
Get
off
Scabbers
chewing
sheets
Harry
was
going
ask
Ron
had
any
the
treacle
tart
but
fell
asleep
almost
once
Perhaps
Harry
had
eaten
bit
too
much
because
had
very
strange
dream
was
wearing
Professor
Quirrell
turban
which
kept
talking
him
telling
him
must
transfer
Slytherin
once
because
was
his
destiny
Harry
told
the
turban
didn
want
Slytherin
got
heavier
and
heavier
tried
pull
off
but
tightened
painfully
and
there
was
Malfoy
laughing
him
struggled
with
then
Malfoy
turned
into
the
hook
nosed
teacher
Snape
whose
laugh
became
high
and
cold
there
was
burst
green
light
and
Harry
woke
sweating
and
shaking
rolled
over
and
fell
asleep
again
and
when
woke
next
day
didn
remember
the
dream
all
CHAPTER
EIGHT
THE
POTIONS
MASTER
There
look
Where
Next
the
tall
kid
with
the
red
hair
Wearing
the
glasses
Did
you
see
his
face
Did
you
see
his
scar
Whispers
followed
Harry
from
the
moment
left
his
dormitory
the
next
day
People
lining
outside
classrooms
stood
tiptoe
get
look
him
doubled
back
pass
him
the
corridors
again
staring
Harry
wished
they
wouldn
because
was
trying
concentrate
finding
his
way
classes
There
were
hundred
and
forty
two
staircases
Hogwarts
wide
sweeping
ones
narrow
rickety
ones
some
that
led
somewhere
different
Friday
some
with
vanishing
step
halfway
that
you
had
remember
jump
Then
there
were
doors
that
wouldn
open
unless
you
asked
politely
tickled
them
exactly
the
right
place
and
doors
that
weren
really
doors
all
but
solid
walls
just
pretending
was
also
very
hard
remember
where
anything
was
because
all
seemed
move
around
lot
The
people
the
portraits
kept
going
visit
each
other
and
Harry
was
sure
the
coats
armor
could
walk
The
ghosts
didn
help
either
was
always
nasty
shock
when
one
them
glided
suddenly
through
door
you
were
trying
open
Nearly
Headless
Nick
was
always
happy
point
new
Gryffindors
the
right
direction
but
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
was
worth
two
locked
doors
and
trick
staircase
you
met
him
when
you
were
late
for
class
would
drop
wastepaper
baskets
your
head
pull
rugs
from
under
your
feet
pelt
you
with
bits
chalk
sneak
behind
you
invisible
grab
your
nose
and
screech
GOT
YOUR
CONK
Even
worse
than
Peeves
that
was
possible
was
the
caretaker
Argus
Filch
Harry
and
Ron
managed
get
the
wrong
side
him
their
very
first
morning
Filch
found
them
trying
force
their
way
through
door
that
unluckily
turned
out
the
entrance
the
out
bounds
corridor
the
third
floor
wouldn
believe
they
were
lost
was
sure
they
were
trying
break
into
purpose
and
was
threatening
lock
them
the
dungeons
when
they
were
rescued
Professor
Quirrell
who
was
passing
Filch
owned
cat
called
Mrs
Norris
scrawny
dust
colored
creature
with
bulging
lamp
like
eyes
just
like
Filch
She
patrolled
the
corridors
alone
Break
rule
front
her
put
just
one
toe
out
line
and
she
whisk
off
for
Filch
who
appear
wheezing
two
seconds
later
Filch
knew
the
secret
passageways
the
school
better
than
anyone
except
perhaps
the
Weasley
twins
and
could
pop
suddenly
any
the
ghosts
The
students
all
hated
him
and
was
the
dearest
ambition
many
give
Mrs
Norris
good
kick
And
then
once
you
had
managed
find
them
there
were
the
classes
themselves
There
was
lot
more
magic
Harry
quickly
found
out
than
waving
your
wand
and
saying
few
funny
words
They
had
study
the
night
skies
through
their
telescopes
every
Wednesday
midnight
and
learn
the
names
different
stars
and
the
movements
the
planets
Three
times
week
they
went
out
the
greenhouses
behind
the
castle
study
Herbology
with
dumpy
little
witch
called
Professor
Sprout
where
they
learned
how
take
care
all
the
strange
plants
and
fungi
and
found
out
what
they
were
used
for
Easily
the
most
boring
class
was
History
Magic
which
was
the
only
one
taught
ghost
Professor
Binns
had
been
very
old
indeed
when
had
fallen
asleep
front
the
staff
room
fire
and
got
next
morning
teach
leaving
his
body
behind
him
Binns
droned
and
while
they
scribbled
down
names
and
dates
and
got
Emetic
the
Evil
and
Uric
the
Oddball
mixed
Professor
Flitwick
the
Charms
teacher
was
tiny
little
wizard
who
had
stand
pile
books
see
over
his
desk
the
start
their
first
class
took
the
roll
call
and
when
reached
Harry
name
gave
excited
squeak
and
toppled
out
sight
Professor
McGonagall
was
again
different
Harry
had
been
quite
right
think
she
wasn
teacher
cross
Strict
and
clever
she
gave
them
talking
the
moment
they
sat
down
her
first
class
Transfiguration
some
the
most
complex
and
dangerous
magic
you
will
learn
Hogwarts
she
said
Anyone
messing
around
class
will
leave
and
not
come
back
You
have
been
warned
Then
she
changed
her
desk
into
pig
and
back
again
They
were
all
very
impressed
and
couldn
wait
get
started
but
soon
realized
they
weren
going
changing
the
furniture
into
animals
for
long
time
After
taking
lot
complicated
notes
they
were
each
given
match
and
started
trying
turn
into
needle
the
end
the
lesson
only
Hermione
Granger
had
made
any
difference
her
match
Professor
McGonagall
showed
the
class
how
had
gone
all
silver
and
pointy
and
gave
Hermione
rare
smile
The
class
everyone
had
really
been
looking
forward
was
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
but
Quirrell
lessons
turned
out
bit
joke
His
classroom
smelled
strongly
garlic
which
everyone
said
was
ward
off
vampire
met
Romania
and
was
afraid
would
coming
back
get
him
one
these
days
His
turban
told
them
had
been
given
him
African
prince
thank
you
for
getting
rid
troublesome
zombie
but
they
weren
sure
they
believed
this
story
For
one
thing
when
Seamus
Finnigan
asked
eagerly
hear
how
Quirrell
had
fought
off
the
zombie
Quirrell
went
pink
and
started
talking
about
the
weather
for
another
they
had
noticed
that
funny
smell
hung
around
the
turban
and
the
Weasley
twins
insisted
that
was
stuffed
full
garlic
well
that
Quirrell
was
protected
wherever
went
Harry
was
very
relieved
find
out
that
wasn
miles
behind
everyone
else
Lots
people
had
come
from
Muggle
families
and
like
him
hadn
had
any
idea
that
they
were
witches
and
wizards
There
was
much
learn
that
even
people
like
Ron
didn
have
much
head
start
Friday
was
important
day
for
Harry
and
Ron
They
finally
managed
find
their
way
down
the
Great
Hall
for
breakfast
without
getting
lost
once
What
have
got
today
Harry
asked
Ron
poured
sugar
his
porridge
Double
Potions
with
the
Slytherins
said
Ron
Snape
Head
Slytherin
House
They
say
always
favors
them
able
see
true
Wish
McGonagall
favored
said
Harry
Professor
McGonagall
was
head
Gryffindor
House
but
hadn
stopped
her
from
giving
them
huge
pile
homework
the
day
before
Just
then
the
mail
arrived
Harry
had
gotten
used
this
now
but
had
given
him
bit
shock
the
first
morning
when
about
hundred
owls
had
suddenly
streamed
into
the
Great
Hall
during
breakfast
circling
the
tables
until
they
saw
their
owners
and
dropping
letters
and
packages
onto
their
laps
Hedwig
hadn
brought
Harry
anything
far
She
sometimes
flew
nibble
his
ear
and
have
bit
toast
before
going
off
sleep
the
owlery
with
the
other
school
owls
This
morning
however
she
fluttered
down
between
the
marmalade
and
the
sugar
bowl
and
dropped
note
onto
Harry
plate
Harry
tore
open
once
said
very
untidy
scrawl
Dear
Harry
know
you
get
Friday
afternoons
off
would
you
like
come
and
have
cup
tea
with
around
three
want
hear
all
about
your
first
week
Send
answer
back
with
Hedwig
Hagrid
Harry
borrowed
Ron
quill
scribbled
Yes
please
see
you
later
the
back
the
note
and
sent
Hedwig
off
again
was
lucky
that
Harry
had
tea
with
Hagrid
look
forward
because
the
Potions
lesson
turned
out
the
worst
thing
that
had
happened
him
far
the
start
term
banquet
Harry
had
gotten
the
idea
that
Professor
Snape
disliked
him
the
end
the
first
Potions
lesson
knew
been
wrong
Snape
didn
dislike
Harry
hated
him
Potions
lessons
took
place
down
one
the
dungeons
was
colder
here
than
the
main
castle
and
would
have
been
quite
creepy
enough
without
the
pickled
animals
floating
glass
jars
all
around
the
walls
Snape
like
Flitwick
started
the
class
taking
the
roll
call
and
like
Flitwick
paused
Harry
name
Yes
said
softly
Harry
Potter
Our
new
celebrity
Draco
Malfoy
and
his
friends
Crabbe
and
Goyle
sniggered
behind
their
hands
Snape
finished
calling
the
names
and
looked
the
class
His
eyes
were
black
like
Hagrid
but
they
had
none
Hagrid
warmth
They
were
cold
and
empty
and
made
you
think
dark
tunnels
You
are
here
learn
the
subtle
science
and
exact
art
potionmaking
began
spoke
barely
more
than
whisper
but
they
caught
every
word
like
Professor
McGonagall
Snape
had
caught
every
word
like
Professor
McGonagall
Snape
had
the
gift
keeping
class
silent
without
effort
there
little
foolish
wand
waving
here
many
you
will
hardly
believe
this
magic
don
expect
you
will
really
understand
the
beauty
the
softly
simmering
cauldron
with
its
shimmering
fumes
the
delicate
power
liquids
that
creep
through
human
veins
bewitching
the
mind
ensnaring
the
senses
can
teach
you
how
bottle
fame
brew
glory
even
stopper
death
you
aren
big
bunch
dunderheads
usually
have
teach
More
silence
followed
this
little
speech
Harry
and
Ron
exchanged
looks
with
raised
eyebrows
Hermione
Granger
was
the
edge
her
seat
and
looked
desperate
start
proving
that
she
wasn
dunderhead
Potter
said
Snape
suddenly
What
would
get
added
powdered
root
asphodel
infusion
wormwood
Powdered

Harry
glanced
Ron
who

Harry
Snape
lips
curled
into
sneer
Tut

Hermione
hand
Let
try
again
Potter
where
would
you
look
told
you
find
bezoar
Hermione
stretched
her
hand
high
into
the
air
would
without
her
leaving
her
seat
but
Harry
didn
have
the
faintest
idea
what
bezoar
was
tried
not
look
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
were
shaking
with
laughter
don
know
sit
Thought
you
wouldn
open
book
before
coming
Potter
Harry
forced
himself
keep
looking
straight
into
those
cold
eyes
had
looked
through
his
books
the
Dursleys
but
did
Snape
expect
him
remember
everything
One
Thousand
Magical
Herbs
and
Fungi
Snape
was
still
ignoring
Hermione
quivering
hand
What
the
difference
Potter
between
monkshood
and
wolfsbane
this
Hermione
stood
her
hand
stretching
toward
the
dungeon
ceiling
don

said
Harry
quietly
think
Hermione
does
though
why
don
you
try
her
few
people
laughed
Harry
caught
Seamus
eye
and
Seamus
winked
Snape
however
was
not
pleased
Sit
down
snapped
Hermione
For
your
information
Potter
asphodel
and
wormwood
make

Draught

and
will
save
you
from
most
poisons
for
monkshood
and
wolfsbane
they
are
the
same
plant
which
also
goes
the
name
aconite
Well
Why
aren
you
all
copying
that
down
There
was
sudden
rummaging
for
quills
and
parchment
Over
the
noise
Snape
said
And
point
will
taken
from
Gryffindor
House
for
your
cheek
Potter
Things
didn
improve
for
the
Gryffindors
the
Potions
lesson
continued
Snape
put
them
all
into
pairs
and
set
them
mixing
simple
potion
cure
boils
swept
around
his
long
black
cloak
watching
them
weigh
dried
nettles
and
crush
snake
fangs
criticizing
almost
everyone
except
Malfoy
whom
seemed
like
was
just
telling
everyone
look
the
perfect
way
Malfoy
had
stewed
his
horned
slugs
when
clouds
acid
green
smoke
and
loud
hissing
filled
the
dungeon
Neville
had
somehow
managed
melt
Seamus
cauldron
into
twisted
blob
and
their
potion
was
seeping
across
the
stone
floor
burning
holes
people
shoes
Within
seconds
the
whole
class
was
standing
their
stools
while
Neville
who
had
been
drenched
the
potion
when
the
cauldron
collapsed
moaned
pain
angry
red
boils
sprang
all
over
his
arms
and
legs
Idiot
boy
snarled
Snape
clearing
the
spilled
potion
away
with
one
wave
his
wand
suppose
you
added
the
porcupine
quills
before
taking
the
cauldron
off
the
fire
Neville
whimpered
boils
started
pop
all
over
his
nose
Take
him
the
hospital
wing
Snape
spat
Seamus
Then
rounded
Harry
and
Ron
who
had
been
working
next
Neville
You
Potter
why
didn
you
tell
him
not
add
the
quills
Thought
make
you
look
good
got
wrong
did
you
That
another
point
you
lost
for
Gryffindor
This
was
unfair
that
Harry
opened
his
mouth
argue
but
Ron
kicked
him
behind
their
cauldron
Doi
push
muttered
heard
Snape
can
turn
very
nasty
they
climbed
the
steps
out
the
dungeon
hour
later
Harry
mind
was
racing
and
his
spirits
were
low
lost
two
points
for
Gryffindor
his
very
first
week
why
did
Snape
hate
him
much
Cheer
said
Ron
Snape
always
taking
points
off
Fred
and
George
Can
come
and
meet
Hagrid
with
you
five
three
they
left
the
castle
and
made
their
way
across
the
grounds
Hagrid
lived
small
wooden
house
the
edge
the
forbidden
forest
crossbow
and
pair
galoshes
were
outside
the
front
door
When
Harry
knocked
they
heard
frantic
scrabbling
from
inside
and
several
booming
barks
Then
Hagrid
voice
rang
out
saying
Back
Fang
back
Hagrid
big
hairy
face
appeared
the
crack
pulled
the
door
open
Hang
said
Back
Fang
let
them
struggling
keep
hold
the
collar
enormous
black
boarhound
There
was
only
one
room
inside
Hams
and
pheasants
were
hanging
from
the
ceiling
copper
kettle
was
boiling
the
open
fire
and
the
corner
stood
massive
bed
with
patchwork
quilt
over
Make
yerselves
home
said
Hagrid
letting
Fang
who
bounded
straight
Ron
and
started
licking
his
ears
Like
Hagrid
Fang
was
clearly
not
fierce
looked
This
Ron
Harry
told
Hagrid
who
was
pouring
boiling
water
into
large
teapot
and
putting
rock
cakes
onto
plate
Another
Weasley
said
Hagrid
glancing
Ron
freckles
spent
half
life
chasin
yer
twin
brothers
away
from
the
forest
The
rock
cakes
were
shapeless
lumps
with
raisins
that
almost
broke
their
teeth
but
Harry
and
Ron
pretended
enjoying
them
they
told
Hagrid
all
about
their
first
lessons
Fang
rested
his
head
Harry
knee
and
drooled
all
over
his
robes
Harry
and
Ron
were
delighted
hear
Hagrid
call
Fitch
that
old
git
fer
that
cat
Mrs
Norris
like
ter
introduce
her
Fang
sometime
yeh
know
every
time
ter
the
school
she
follows
everywhere
Can
get
rid
her
Fitch
puts
her
Harry
told
Hagrid
about
Snape
lesson
Hagrid
like
Ron
told
Harry
not
worry
about
that
Snape
liked
hardly
any
the
students
But
seemed
really
hate
Rubbish
said
Hagrid
Why
should
Yet
Harry
couldn
help
thinking
that
Hagrid
didn
quite
meet
his
eyes
when
said
that
How
yer
brother
Charlie
Hagrid
asked
Ron
liked
him
lot
great
with
animals
Harry
wondered
Hagrid
had
changed
the
subject
purpose
While
Ron
told
Hagrid
all
about
Charlie
work
with
dragons
Harry
picked
piece
paper
that
was
lying
the
table
under
the
tea
cozy
was
cutting
from
the
Daily
Prophet
GRINGOTTS
BREAK
LATEST
Investigations
continue
into
the
break
Gringotts
July
widely
believed
the
work
Dark
wizards
witches
unknown
Gringotts
goblins
today
insisted
that
nothing
had
been
taken
The
vault
that
was
searched
had
fact
been
emptied
the
same
day
But
not
telling
you
what
was
there
keep
your
noses
out
you
know
what
good
for
you
said
Gringotts
spokesgoblin
this
afternoon
Harry
remembered
Ron
telling
him
the
train
that
someone
had
tried
rob
Gringotts
but
Ron
hadn
mentioned
the
date
Hagrid
said
Harry
that
Gringotts
break
happened
birthday
might
been
happening
while
were
there
There
was
doubt
about
Hagrid
definitely
didn
meet
Harry
eyes
this
time
grunted
and
offered
him
another
rock
cake
Harry
read
the
story
again
The
vault
that
was
searched
had
fact
been
emptied
earlier
that
same
day
Hagrid
had
emptied
vault
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
you
could
call
emptying
taking
out
that
grubby
little
package
Had
that
been
what
the
thieves
were
looking
for
Harry
and
Ron
walked
back
the
castle
for
dinner
their
pockets
weighed
down
with
rock
cakes
they
been
too
polite
refuse
Harry
thought
that
none
the
lessons
had
far
had
given
him
much
think
about
tea
with
Hagrid
Had
Hagrid
collected
that
package
just
time
Where
was
now
And
did
Hagrid
know
something
about
Snape
that
didn
want
tell
Harry
CHAPTER
NINE
THE
MIDNIGHT
DUEL
Harry
had
never
believed
would
meet
boy
hated
more
than
Dudley
but
that
was
before
met
Draco
Malfoy
Still
first
year
Gryffindors
only
had
Potions
with
the
Slytherins
they
didn
have
put
with
Malfoy
much
least
they
didn
until
they
spotted
notice
pinned
the
Gryffindor

Malfoy
had
been
looking
forward
learning

more
than
anything
else
You

yourself
said
Ron
reasonably
Anyway

Malfoy
always
going
about
how
good
Quidditch
but
bet
that
all
talk
Malfay
certainly
did
talk
about
flying
lot
complained
loudly
about
first
years
never
getting
the
house
Quidditch
teams
and
told
long
boastful
stories
that
always
seemed
end
with
him
narrowly
escaping
Muggles
helicopters
wasn
the
only
one
though
the
way
Seamus
Finnigan
told
spent
most
his
childhood

around
the
countryside

broomstick
Even
Ron
would
tell
anyone
who

time
almost
hit

Charlie
old
broom
Everyone
from
wizarding
families
talked
about
Quidditch
constantly
Ron
had
already
had
big
argument
with
Dean
Thomas
who
shared
their
dormitory
about
soccer
Ron
couldn
see
what
was
exciting
about
game
with
only
one
ball
where
one
was
allowed
fly
Harry
had
caught
Ron
prodding
Dean
poster
West
Ham
soccer
team
trying
make
the
players
move
Neville
had
never
been
broomstick
his
life
because
his
grandmother
had
never
let
him
near
one
Privately
Harry
felt
she
had
good
reason
because
Neville
managed
have
extraordinary
number
accidents
even
with
both
feet
the
ground
Hermione
Granger
was
almost
nervous
about
flying
Neville
was
This
was
something
you
couldn
learn

she
hadn
tried

all
stupid
with
flying
tips
she
gotten
out

book
called
Quidditch
Through
the
Ages
Neville
was
hanging
her
every
word
desperate
for
anything
that
might
help
him
hang
his
broomstick
later
but
everybody
else
was
very
pleased
when
Hermione
lecture
was
interrupted
the
arrival
the
mail
Harry
hadn
had
single
letter
since
Hagrid
note
something
that
Malfoy
had
been
quick

course
Malfoy

always
bringing
him
packages
sweets
from

which
opened
gloatingly
the
Slytherin
table
barn
owl
brought
Neville
small
package
from
his
grandmother
opened
excitedly
and
showed
them
glass

the
size
large
marble
which
seemed
full
white
smoke
Remembrall
explained
Gran
knows

things
this
tells
you
there
something
you
forgotten
Look
you
hold
tight
like
this
and
turns
red
His
face
fell
because
the
Remembrall
had
suddenly
glowed
scarlet
You
forgotten
something
Neville
was
trying
remember
what
forgotten
when
Draco
Malfoy
who
was
passing
the
Gryffindor
table
snatched
the
Remembrall
out
his
hand
Harry
and
Ron
jumped
their
feet
They
were
half
hoping
for
reason
fight
Malfay
but
Professor
McGonagall
who
could
spot
trouble
quicker
than
any
teacher
the
school
was
there
flash
What
going
Malfoy
got
Remembrall
Professor
Scowling
Malfoy
quickly
dropped
the
Remembrall
back
the
table
Just
looking
said
and
sloped
away
with
Crabbe
and
Goyle
behind
him
three
thirty
that
afternoon
Harry
Ron
and
the
other
Gryffindors
hurried
down
the
front
steps
onto
the
grounds
for
their
first
flying
lesson
was
clear
breezy
day
and
the
grass
rippled
under
their
feet
they
marched
down
the
sloping
lawns
toward
smooth
flat
lawn
the
opposite
side
the
grounds
the
forbidden
forest
whose
trees
were
swaying
darkly
the
distance
The
Slytherins
were
already
there
and
were
twenty
broomsticks
lying
neat
lines
the
ground
Harry
had
heard
Fred
and
George
Weasley
complain
about
the
school
brooms
saying
that
some
them
started
vibrate
you
flew
too
high
always
flew
slightly
the
left
Their
teacher
Madam
Hooch
arrived
She
had
short
gray
hair
and
yellow
eyes
like
hawk
Well
what
are
you
all
waiting
for
she
barked
Everyone
stand
broomstick
Come
hurry
Harry
glanced
down
his
broom
was
old
and
some
the
twigs
stuck
out
odd
angles
Stick
out
your
right
hand
over
your
broom
called
Madam
Hooch
the
front
and
say
UPF
everyone
shouted
Harry
broom
jumped
into
his
hand
once
but
was
one
the
few
that
did
Hermione
Granger
had
simply
rolled
over
the
ground
and
Neville
hadn
moved
all
Perhaps
brooms
like
horses
could
tell
when
you
were
afraid
thought
Harry
there
was
quaver
Neville
voice
that
said
only
too
clearly
that
wanted
keep
his
feet
the
ground
Madam
Hooch
then
showed
them
how
mount
their
brooms
without
sliding
off
the
end
and
walked
and
down
the
rows
correcting
their
grips
Harry
and
Ron
were
delighted
when
she
told
Malfoy
been
doing
wrong
for
years
Now
when
blow
whistle
you
kick
off
from
the
ground
hard
said
Madam
Hooch
Keep
your
brooms
steady
rise
few
feet
and
then
come
straight
back
down
leaning
forward
slightly
whistle
three
two
But
Neville
nervous
and
jumpy
and
frightened
being
left
the
ground
pushed
off
hard
before
the
whistle
had
touched
Madam
Hooch
lips
Come
back
boy
she
shouted
but
Neville
was
rising
straight
like
cork
shot
out
bottle
twelve
feet
twenty
feet
Harry
saw
his
scared
white
face
look
down
the
ground
falling
away
saw
him
gasp
slip
sideways
off
the
broom
and
WHAM
thud
and
nasty
crack
and
Neville
lay
facedown
the
grass
heap
His
broomstick
was
still
rising
higher
and
higher
and
started
drift
lazily
toward
the
forbidden
forest
and
out
sight
Madam
Hooch
was
bending
over
Neville
her
face
white
his
Broken
wrist
Harry
heard
her
mutter
Come
boy
all
right
you
get
She
turned
the
rest
the
class
None
you
move
while
take
this
boy
the
hospital
wing
You
leave
those
brooms
where
they
are
you
out
Hogwarts
before
you
can
say
Quidditch
Come
dear
Neville
his
face
tear
streaked
clutching
his
wrist
hobbled
off
with
Madam
Hooch
who
had
her
arm
around
him
sooner
were
they
out
earshot
than
Malfoy
burst
into
laughter
Did
you
see
his
face
the
great
lump
The
other
Slytherins
joined
Shut
Malfoy
snapped
Parvati
Patil
Ooh

Pansy
Parkinson
hard

Slytherin
girl
Never
thought

little
crybabies
Parvati
Look
said
Malfoy
darting
forward
and
snatching
something
out
the
grass
that
stupid
thing
Longbottom
gran
sent
him
The
Remembrall
glittered
the
sun
held
Give

Malfoy
said
Harry
quietly
Everyone
stopped
talking
watch
Malfoy
smiled
nastily
think

Longbottom

Harry
yelled
but
Malfoy
had
leapt
onto
his
broomstick
and
taken
off

been
lying

fly
well
Hovering
level
with
the
topmost
branches
oak
called
Come

Potter
Harry
grabbed
his
broom
shouted
Hermione
Granger
Madam
Hooch
told
not

get
all
into
trouble
Harry
ignored
her
Blood
was
pounding
his
ears
mounted
the
broom
and
kicked
hard
against
the
ground
and
soared
air
rushed
through
his
hair
and
his
robes
whipped
out
behind
him
and
rush
fierce
joy
realized
found
something
could
without
being
taught
this
was
easy
this
was
wonderful
pulled
his
broomstick
little
take
even
higher
and
heard
screams
and
gasps
girls
back
the
ground
and
admiring
whoop
from
Ron
turned
his
broomstick
sharply
face
Malfoy
midair
Malfoy
looked
stunned
Give
here
Harry
called
knock
you
off
that
broom
yeah
said
Malfoy
trying
sneer
but
looking
worried
Harry
knew
somehow
what
leaned
forward
and
grasped
the
broom
tightly
both
hands
and
shot
toward
Malfay
like
javelin
Malfoy
only
just
got
out
the
way
time
Harry
made
sharp
about
face
and
held
the
broom
steady
few
people
below
were
clapping
Crabbe
and
Goyle
here

your
neck
Malfoy
Harry
called
The
same
thought
seemed
have
struck
Malfoy
Catch
you
can
then
shouted
and
threw
the
glass
ball
high
into
the
air
and
streaked
back
toward
the
ground
Harry
saw
though
slow
motion
the
ball
rise
the
air
and
then
start
fall
leaned
forward
and
pointed
his
broom
handle
down
next
second
was
gathering
speed
steep
dive
racing
the
ball
wind
whistled
his
ears
mingled
with
the
screams
people
watching
stretched
out
his
hand
foot
from
the
ground
caught
just
time
pull
his
broom
straight
and
toppled
gently
onto
the
grass
with
the
Remembrall
clutched
safely
his
fist
HARRY
POTTER
His
heart
sank
faster
than
just
dived
Professor
McGonagall
was
running
toward
them
got
his
feet
trembling
Never
all
time
Hogwarts
Professor
McGonagall
was
almost
speechless
with
shock
and
her
glasses
flashed
furiously
how
dare
you
might
have
broken
your
neck
wasn
his
fault
Professor
quiet
Miss
Patil
But

Now

doorstep
the
front
steps
the
marble
staircase
inside
and
still
Professor
McGonagall
didn
say
word
him
She
wrenched
open
doors
and
marched
along
corridors
with
Harry
trotting
miserably
behind
her
Maybe
she
was
taking
him
Dumbledore
thought
Hagrid
expelled
but
allowed

Perhaps

Hagrid
assistant
His
stomach
twisted
imagined
watching
Ron
and
the
others
becoming
wizards
while
stumped
around
the
grounds
carrying
Hagrid
bag
Professor
McGonagall
stopped
outside
classroom
She
opened
the
door
and
poked
her
head
inside
Excuse

Flitwick

them
into

Out

barked
Peeves
threw
the
chalk
into

loudly
and

the

behind
him
and

Potter
Harry
nodded
silently
didn
have
clue
what

some
the
feeling
started
coming
back

legs

foot
dive
Professor
McGonagall
told
Wood

Having

Potter
When

Muggles
You

friends

said
Harry
coolly
There
was
course
nothing
all
little
about
Crabbe
and
Goyle
but
the
High
Table
was
full
teachers
neither
them
could
more
than
crack
their
knuckles
and
scowl
take
you
anytime
own
said
Malfoy
Tonight

Ron

Malfoy

Crabbe
and
Goyle
sizing
them
Crabbe
said
Midnight

When
Malfoy
had
gone
Ron
and
Harry
looked
each
other
What

Harry
And

second
Well

said
Ron
casually
getting
started
last
his
cold
pie
Catching

look
Harry
face
added
quickly
But

proper
duels

The
most

Neither

damage
bet
expected

And

wave
wand
and

Throw

nose
Ron
suggested
Excuse
They
both
looked
was
Hermione
Granger
Can
person
eat
peace
this
place
said
Ron
Hermione
ignored
him
and
spoke
Harry
couldn
help
overhearing
what
you
and
Malfoy
were
saying
Bet
you
could
Ron
muttered
and
you
mustn
wandering
around
the
school
night
think
the
points
you
lose
Gryffindor
you
caught
and
you
bound
really
very
selfish
you
And
really
none
your
business
said
Harry
Good
bye
said
Ron
All
the
same
wasn
what
you
call
the
perfect
end
the
day
Harry
thought
lay
awake
much
later
listening
Dean
and
Seamus
falling
asleep
Neville
wasn
back
from
the
hospital
wing
Ron
had
spent
all
evening
giving
him
advice
such
tries
curse
you
you
better
dodge
because
can
remember
how
block
them
There
was
very
good
chance
they
were
going
get
caught
Filch
Mrs
Norris
and
Harry
felt
was
pushing
his
luck
breaking
another
school
rule
today
the
other
hand
Malfoys
sneering
face
kept
looming
out
the
darkness
this
was
his
big
chance
beat
Malfoy
face
face
couldn
miss
Half
past
eleven
Ron
muttered
last
better
They
pulled
their
bathrobes
picked
their
wands
and
crept
across
the
tower
room
down
the
spiral
staircase
and
into
the
Gryffindor
common
room
few
embers
were
still
glowing
the
fireplace
turning
all
the
armchairs
into
hunched
black
shadows
They
had
almost
reached
the
portrait
hole
when
voice
spoke
from
the
chair
nearest
them
can
believe
you
going
this
Harry
lamp
flickered
was
Hermione
Granger
wearing
pink
bathrobe
and
frown
You
said
Ron
furiously
back
bed
almost
told
your
brother
Hermione
snapped
Percy
prefect
put
stop
this
Harry
couldn
believe
anyone
could
interfering
Come
said
Ron
pushed
open
the
portrait
the
Fat
Lady
and
climbed
through
the
hole
Hermione
wasn
going
give
that
easily
She
followed
Ron
through
the
portrait
hole
hissing
them
like
angry
goose
Don
you
care
about
Gryffindor
you
only
care
about
yourselves
don
want
Slytherin
win
the
house
cup
and
you
lose
all
the
points
got
from
Professor
McGonagall
for
knowing
about
Switching
Spells
away
All
right
but
warned
you
you
just
remember
what
said
when
you
the
train
home
tomorrow
you
But
what
they
were
they
didn
find
out
Hermione
had
turned
the
portrait
the
Fat
Lady
get
back
inside
and
found
herself
facing
empty
painting
The
Fat
Lady
had
gone
nighttime
visit
and
Hermione
was
locked
out
Gryffindor
tower
Now
what
going
she
asked
shrilly
That
your
problem
said
Ron
got
going
late
They
hadn
even
reached
the
end
the
corridor
when
Hermione
caught
with
them

Ron
loudly
Shut

Harry
sharply
heard
something
was
sort
snuffling
Mrs
Norris
breathed
Ron
squinting
through
the
dark
wasn
Mrs
Norris
was
Neville
was
curled
the
floor
fast
asleep
but
jerked
suddenly
awake
they
crept
nearer
Thank

minute
Good

Don

said
Neville
scrambling
his
feet
don
want

alone
the
Bloody
Baron
been
past
twice
already
Ron
looked
his
watch
and
then
glared
furiously
Hermione
and
Neville
either
you
get
caught
never
rest
until
learned
that
Curse
the
Bogies
Quirrell
told
about
and
used
you
Hermione
opened
her
mouth
perhaps
tell
Ron
exactly
how
use
the
Curse
the
Bogies
but
Harry
hissed
her
quiet
and
beckoned
them
all
forward
They
flitted
along
corridors
striped
with
bars
moonlight
from
the
high
windows
every
turn
Harry
expected
run
into
Filch
Mrs
Norris
but
they
were
lucky
They
sped
staircase
the
third
floor
and
tiptoed
toward
the
trophy
room
Malfoy
and
Crabbe
weren
there
yet
The
crystal
trophy
cases
glimmered
where
the
moonlight
caught
them
Cups
shields
plates
and
statues
winked
silver
and
gold
the
darkness
They
edged
along
the
walls
keeping
their
eyes
the
doors
either
end
the
room
Harry
took
out
his
wand
case
Malfoy
leapt
and
started
once
The
minutes
crept
late
maybe
chickened
out
Ron
whispered
Then
noise
the
next
room
made
them
jump
Harry
had
only
just
raised
his
wand
when
they
heard
someone
speak
and
wasn
Malfoy
Sniff
around
sweet
they
might
lurking
corner
was
Filch
speaking
Mrs
Norris
Horror
struck
Harry
waved
madly
the
other
three
follow
him
quickly
possible
they
scurried
silently
toward
the
door
away
from
Filch
voice
Neville
robes
had
barely
whipped
round
the
corner
when
they
heard
Filch
enter
the
trophy
room
They
here
somewhere
they
heard
him
mutter
probably
hiding
This
way
Harry
mouthed
the
others
and
petrified
they
began
creep
down
long
gallery
full
suits
armor
They
could
hear
Filch
getting
nearer
Neville
suddenly
let
out
frightened
squeak
and
broke
into
run
tripped
grabbed
Ron
around
the
waist
and
the
pair
them
toppled
right
into
suit
armor
The
clanging
and
crashing
were
enough
wake
the
whole
castle
RUN
Harry
yelled
and
the
four
them
sprinted
down
the
gallery
not
looking
back
see
whether
Filch
was
following
they
swung
around
the
doorpost
and
galloped
down
one
corridor
then
another
Harry
the
lead
without
any
idea
where
they
were
where
they
were
going
they
ripped
through
tapestry
and
found
themselves
hidden
passageway
hurtled
along
and
came
out
near
their
Charms
classroom
which
they
knew
was
miles
from
the
trophy
room
think
lost
him
Harry
panted
leaning
against
the
cold
wall
and
wiping
his
forehead
Neville
was
bent
double
wheezing
and
spluttering
told
you
Hermione
gasped
clutching
the
stitch
her
chest
told
you
got
get
back
Gryffindor
tower
said
Ron
quickly
possible
Malfoy
tricked
you
Hermione
said
Harry
You
realize
that
don
you
was
never
going
meet
you
Filch
knew
someone
was
going
the
trophy
room
Malfoy
must
have
tipped
him
off
Harry
thought
she
was
probably
right
but
wasn
going
tell
her
that
Let
wasn
going
that
simple
They
hadn
gone
more
than
dozen
paces
when
doorknob
rattled
and
something
came
shooting
out
classroom
front
them
was
Peeves
caught
sight
them
and
gave
squeal
delight
Shut
Peeves
please
you
get
thrown
out
Peeves
cackled
Wandering
around
midnight
Ickle
Firsties
Tut
tut
tut
Naughty
naughty

get
caughty
Not
you
don
give
away
Peeves
please
Should
tell
Filch

said
Peeves
saintly
voice
but
his
eyes
glittered
wickedly
for
your
own
good
you
know
Get
out
the
way
snapped
Ron
taking
swipe
Peeves
this
was
big
mistake
STUDENTS
OUT
BED
Peeves
bellowed
STUDENTS
OUT
BED
DOWN
THE
CHARMS
CORRIDOR
Ducking
under
Peeves
they
ran
for
their
lives
right
the
end
the
corridor
where
they
slammed
into
door
and
was
locked
This
Ron
moaned
they
pushed
helplessly
the
door
done
for
This
the
end
They
could
hear
footsteps
Filch
running
fast
could
toward
Peeves
shouts
move
over
Hermione
snarled
She
grabbed
Harry
wand
tapped
the
lock
and
whispered
Alohomora
The
lock
clicked
and
the
door
swung
open
they
piled
through
shut
quickly
and
pressed
their
ears
against
listening
Which
way
did
they
Peeves
Filch
was
saying
Quick
tell
Say
please
Don
mess
with
Peeves
now
where
did
they
Shan
say
nothing
you
don
say
please
said
Peeves
his
annoying
singsong
voice
All
right
please
NOTHING
haaa
Told
you
wouldn
say
nothing
you
didn
say
please
Haaaaaa
And
they
heard
the
sound
Peeves
whooshing
away
and
Filch
cursing
rage
thinks
this
door
locked
Harry
whispered
think
okay
get
off
Neville
For
Neville
had
been
tugging
the
sleeve
Harry
bathrobe
for
the
last
minute
What
Harry
turned
around
and
saw
quite
clearly
what
For
moment
was
sure
walked
into
nightmare
this
was
too
much
top
everything
that
had
happened
far
They
weren
room
had
supposed
They
were
corridor
The
forbidden
corridor
the
third
floor
And
now
they
knew
why
was
forbidden
They
were
looking
straight
into
the
eyes
monstrous
dog
dog
that
filled
the
whole
space
between
ceiling
and
floor
had
three
heads
Three
pairs
rolling
mad
eyes
three
noses
twitching
and
quivering
their
direction
three
drooling
mouths
saliva
hanging
slippery
ropes
from
yellowish
fangs
was
standing
quite
still
all
six
eyes
staring
them
and
Harry
knew
that
the
only
reason
they
weren
already
dead
was
that
their
sudden
appearance
had
taken
surprise
but
was
quickly
getting
over
that
there
was
mistaking
what
those
thunderous
growls
meant
Harry
groped
for
the
doorknob
between
Filch
and
death
take
Filch
They
fell
backward
Harry
slammed
the
door
shut
and
they
ran
they
almost
flew
back
down
the
corridor
Filch
must
have
hurried
off
look
for
them
somewhere
else
because
they
didn
see
him
anywhere
but
they
hardly
cared
all
they
wanted
was
put
much
space
possible
between
them
and
that
monster
They
didn
stop
running
until
they
reached
the
portrait
the
Fat
Lady
the
seventh
floor
Where
earth
have
you
all
been
she
asked
looking
their
bathrobes
hanging
off
their
shoulders
and
their
flushed
sweaty
faces
Never
mind
that
pig
snout
pig
snout
panted
Harry
and
the
portrait
swung
forward
They
scrambled
into
the
common
room
and
collapsed
trembling
into
armchairs
was
while
before
any
them
said
anything
Neville
indeed
looked
never
speak
again
What
they
think
they
doing
keeping
thing
like
that
locked
school
said
Ron
finally
any
dog
needs
exercise
that
one
does
Hermione
had
got
both
her
breath
and
her
bad
temper
back
again
You
don
use
your
eyes
any
you
you
she
snapped
Didn
you
see
what
was
standing
The
floor
Harry
suggested
wasn
looking
its
feet
was
too
busy
with
its
heads
not
the
floor
was
standing
trapdoor
obviously
guarding
something
She
stood
glaring
them
hope
you
pleased
with
yourselves
could
all
have
been
killed
worse
expelled
Now
you
don
mind
going
bed
Ron
stared
after
her
his
mouth
open
don
mind
said
You
think
dragged
her
along
wouldn
you
But
Hermione
had
given
Harry
something
else
think
about
climbed
back
into
bed
The
dog
was
guarding
something
What
had
Hagrid
said
Gringotts
was
the
safest
place
the
world
for
something
you
wanted
hide
except
perhaps
Hogwarts
looked
though
Harry
had
found
out
where
the
grubby
littie
package
from
vault
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
was
CHAPTER
TEN
HALLOWEEN
Malfoy
couldn
believe
his
eyes
when
saw
that
Harry
and
Ron
were
still
Hogwarts
the
next
day
looking
tired
but
perfectly
cheerful
Indeed
the
next
morning
Harry
and
Ron
thought
that
meeting
the
three
headed
dog
had
been
excellent
adventure
and
they
were
quite
keen
have
another
one
the
meantime
Harry
filled
Ron
about
the
package
that
seemed
have
been
moved
from
Gringotts
Hogwarts
and
they
spent
lot
time
wondering
what
could
possibly
need
such
heavy
protection
either
really
valuable
really
dangerous
said
Ron
both
said
Harry
But
all
they
knew
for
sure
about
the
mysterious
object
was
that
was
about
two
inches
long
they
didn
have
much
chance
guessing
what
was
without
further
clues
Neither
Neville
nor
Hermione
showed
the
slightest
interest
what
lay
underneath
the
dog
and
the
trapdoor
All
Neville
cared
about
was
never
going
near
the
dog
again
Hermione
was
now
refusing
speak
Harry
and
Ron
but
she
was
such
bossy
know
all
that
they
saw
this
added
bonus
All
they
really
wanted
now
was
way
getting
back
Malfoy
and
their
great
delight
just
such
thing
arrived
the
mail
about
week
later
the
owls
flooded
into
the
Great
Hall
usual
everyone
attention
was
caught
once
long
thin
package
carried
six
large
screech
owls
Harry
was
just
interested
everyone
else
see
what
was
this
large
parcel
and
was
amazed
when
the
owls
soared
down
and
dropped
right
front
him
knocking
his
bacon
the
floor
They
had
hardly
fluttered
out
the
way
when
another
owl
dropped
letter
top
the
parcel
Harry
ripped
open
the
letter
first
which
was
lucky
because
said
NOT
OPEN
THE
PARCEL
THE
TABLE
contains
your
new
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
but

Oliver
Wood

meet
you

the
Quidditch
field

clock
for
your
first
training
session
Professor
McGonagall
Harry
had
difficulty
hiding
his
glee
handed
the
note
Ron
read
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
Ron
moaned
enviously
never
even
touched
one
They
left
the
hall
quickly
wanting
unwrap
the
broomstick
private
before
their
first
class
but
halfway
across
the
entrance
hall
they
found
the
way
upstairs
barred
Crabbe
and
Goyle
Malfoy
seized
the
package
from
Harry
and
felt
That
broomstick
said
throwing
back
Harry
with
mixture
jealousy
and
spite
his
face
You

this
time
Potter
first
years

Ron
couldn
resist
not
any
old
broomstick
said
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
What

Malfoy
Comet
Two
Sixty
Ron
grinned
Harry
Comets

flashy
but
they

same
league

Nimbus
What
would
you
know
about
Weasley
you
couldn
afford
half
the
handle
Malfoy
snapped
back
suppose
you
and
your
brothers
have
save
twig
twig
Before
Ron
could
answer
Professor
Flitwick
appeared
Malfoy
elbow
Not
arguing

squeaked
Potter

Professor
said
Malfoy
quickly
Yes

said
Professor
Flitwick
beaming
Harry
Professor
McGonagall
told
all
about
the
special
circumstances
Potter
And

said
Harry
fighting
not
laugh
the
look
horror
Malfoy
face
And
really
thanks
Malfoy
here
that
got
added
Harry
and
Ron
headed
upstairs
smothering
their
laughter
Malfoy
obvious
rage
and
confusion
Well
true
Harry
chortled
they
reached
the
top
the
marble
staircase
hadn
stolen
Neville
Remembrall
wouln
the
team
suppose
you
think
that
reward
for
breaking
rules
came
angry
voice
from
just
behind
them
Hermione
was
stomping
the
stairs
looking
disapprovingly
the
package
Harry
hand
thought
you
weren
speaking
said
Harry
Yes
don
stop
now
said
Ron
doing
much
good
Hermione
marched
away
with
her
nose
the
air
Harry
had
lot
trouble
keeping
his
mind
his
lessons
that
day
kept
wandering
the
dormitory
where
his
new
broomstick
was
lying
under
his
bed
straying
off
the
Quidditch
field
where
learning
play
that
night
bolted
his
dinner
that
evening
without
noticing
what
was
eating
and
then
rushed
upstairs
with
Ron
unwrap
the
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
last
Wow
Ron
sighed
the
broomstick
rolled
onto
Harry
bedspread
Even
Harry
who
knew
nothing
about
the
different
brooms
thought
looked
wonderful
Sleek
and
shiny
with
mahogany
handle
had
long
tail
neat
straight
twigs
and
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
written
gold
near
the
top
seven
clock
drew
nearer
Harry
left
the
castle
and
set
off
the
dusk
toward
the
Quidditch
field
Held
never
been
inside
the
stadium
before
Hundreds
seats
were
raised
stands
around
the
field
that
the
spectators
were
high
enough
see
what
was
going
either
end
the
field
were
three
golden
poles
with
hoops
the
end
They
reminded
Harry
the
little
plastic
sticks
Muggle
children
blew
bubbles
through
except
that
they
were
fifty
feet
high
Too
eager
fly
again
wait
for
Wood
Harry
mounted
his
broomstick
and
kicked
off
from
the
ground
What
feeling
swooped
and
out
the
goal
posts
and
then
sped
and
down
the
field
The
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
turned
wherever
wanted
his
lightest
touch
Hey
Potter
come
down
Oliver
Wood
had
arrived
fie
was
carrying
large
wooden
crate
under
his
arm
Harry
landed
next
him
Very
nice
said
Wood
his
eyes
glinting
see
what
McGonagall
meant
you
really
are
natural
just
going
teach
you
the
rules
this
evening
then
you
joining
team
practice
three
times
week
opened
the
crate
Inside
were
four
different
sized
balls
Right
said
Wood
Now
Quidditch
easy
enough
understand
even
not
too
easy
play
There
are
seven
players
each
side
Three
them
are
called
Chasers
Three
Chasers
Harry
repeated
Wood
took
out
bright
red
ball
about
the
size
soccer
ball
This
ball
called
the
Quaffle
said
Wood
The
Chasers
throw
the
Quaffle
each
other
and
try
and
get
through
one
the
hoops
score
goal
Ten
points
every
time
the
Quaffle
goes
through
one
the
hoops
Follow
The
Chasers
throw
the
Quaffle
and
put
through
the
hoops
score
Harry
recited
that
sort
like
basketball
broomsticks
with
six
hoops
isn
What
basketball
said
Wood
curiously
Never
mind
said
Harry
quickly
Now
there
another
player
each
side
who
called
the
Keeper
Keeper
for
Gryffindor
have
fly
around
our
hoops
and
stop
the
other
team
from
scoring
Three
Chasers
one
Keeper
said
Harry
who
was
determined
remember
all
And
they
play
with
the
Quaffle
Okay
got
that
what
are
they
for
pointed
the
three
balls
left
inside
the
box
show
you
now
said
Wood
Take
this
handed
Harry
small
club
bit
like
short
baseball
bat
going
show
you
what
the
Bludgers
Wood
said
These
two
are
the
Bludgers
showed
Harry
two
identical
balls
jet
black
and
slightly
smaller
than
the
red
Quaffle
Harry
noticed
that
they
seemed
straining
escape
the
straps
holding
them
inside
the
box
Stand
back
Wood
warned
Harry
bent
down
and
freed
one
the
Bludgers
once
the
black
ball
rose
high
the
air
and
then
pelted
straight
Harry
face
Harry
swung
with
the
bat
stop
from
breaking
his
nose
and
sent
zigzagging
away
into
the
air
zoomed
around
their
heads
and
then
shot
Wood
who
dived
top
and
managed
pin
the
ground
See
Wood
panted
forcing
the
struggling
Bludger
back
into
the
crate
and
strapping
down
safely
The
Bludgers
rocket
around
trying
knock
players
off
their
brooms
That
why
you
have
two
Beaters
each
team
the
Weasley
twins
are
ours
their
job
protect
their
side
from
the
Bludgers
and
try
and
knock
them
toward
the
other
team
think
you
got
all
that
Three
Chasers
try
and
score
with
the
Quaffle
the
Keeper
guards
the
goal
posts
the
Beaters
keep
the
Bludgers
away
from
their
team
Harry
reeled
off
Very
good
said
Wood
have
the
Bludgers
ever
killed
anyone
Harry
asked
hoping
sounded
offhand
Never
Hogwarts
had
couple
broken
jaws
but
nothing
worse
than
that
Now
the
last
member
the
team
the
Seeker
That
you
And
you
don
have
worry
about
the
Quaffle
the
Bludgers
unless
they
crack
head
open
Don
worry
the
Weasleys
are
more
than
match
for
the
Bludgers
mean
they
like
pair
human
Bludgers
themselves
Wood
reached
into
the
crate
and
took
out
the
fourth
and
last
ball
Compared
with
the
Quaffle
and
the
Bludgers
was
tiny
about
the
size
large
walnut
was
bright
gold
and
had
little
fluttering
silver
wings
This
said
Wood
the
Golden
Snitch
and
the
most
important
ball
the
lot
very
hard

because
fast
and
difficult

the
Seeker
job
catch
You
got
weave
and
out
the
Chasers
Beaters
Bludgers
and
Quaffle
get
before
the
other
team
Seeker
because
whichever
Seeker
catches
the
Snitch
wins
his
team
extra
hundred
and
fifty
points
they
nearly
always
win
That
why
Seekers
get
fouled
much
game
Quidditch
only
ends
when
the
Snitch
caught
can
for
ages
think
the
record
three
months
they
had
keep
bringing
substitutes
the
players
could
get
some
sleep
Well
that
any
questions
Harry
shook
his
head
understood
what
had
all
right
was
doing
that
was
going
the
problem
won
practice
with
the
Snitch
yet
said
Wood
carefully
shutting
back
inside
the
crate
too
dark
might
lose
Let
try
you
out
with
few
these
pulled
bag
ordinary
golf
balls
out
his
pocket
and
few
minutes
later
and
Harry
were
the
air
Wood
throwing
the
golf
balls
hard
could
every
direction
for
Harry
catch
Harry
didn
miss
single
one
and
Wood
was
delighted
After
half
hour
night
had
really
fallen
and
they
couldn
carry
That
Quidditch
cup
have
our
name
this
year
said
Wood
happily
they
trudged
back
the
castle
wouldn
surprised
you
turn
out
better
than
Charlie
Weasley
and
could
have
played
for
England
hadn
gone
off
chasing
dragons
Perhaps
was
because
was
now
busy
what
with
Quidditch
practice
three
evenings
week
top
all
his
homework
but
Harry
could
hardly
believe
when
realized
that
already
been
Hogwarts
two
months
The
castle
felt
more
like
home
than
Privet
Drive
ever
had
His
lessons
too
were
becoming
more
and
more
interesting
now
that
they
had
mastered
the
basics
Halloween
morning
they
woke
the
delicious
smell
baking
pumpkin
wafting
through
the
corridors
Even
better
Professor
Flitwick
announced
Charms
that
thought
they
were
ready
start
making
objects
fly
something
they
had
all
been
dying
try
since
they
seen
him
make
Neville
toad
zoom
around
the
classroom
Professor
Flitwick
put
the
class
into
pairs
practice
Harry
partner
was
Seamus
Finnigan
which
was
relief
because
Neville
had
been
trying
catch
his
eye
Ron
however
was
working
with
Hermione
Granger
was
hard
tell
whether
Ron
Hermione
was
angrier
about
this
She
hadn
spoken
either
them
since
the
day
Harry
broomstick
had
arrived
Now
don
forget
that
nice
wrist
movement
been
practicing
squeaked
Professor
Flitwick
perched
top
his
pile
books
usual
Swish
and
flick
remember
swish
and
flick
And
saying
the
magic
words
properly
very
important
too
never
forget
Wizard
Baruffio
who
said
instead
and
found
himself
the
floor
with
buffalo
his
chest
was
very
difficult
Harry
and
Seamus
swished
and
flicked
but
the
feather
they
were
supposed
sending
skyward
just
lay
the
desktop
Seamus
got
impatient
that
prodded
with
his
wand
and
set
fire
Harry
had
put
out
with
his
hat
Ron
the
next
table
wasn
having
much
more
luck
Wingardium
Leviosa
shouted
waving
his
long
arms
like
windmill
You
saying
wrong
Harry
heard
Hermione
snap
Wing
gar
dium
Levi
make
the
gar
nice
and
long
You
then
you
clever
Ron
snarled
Hermione
rolled
the
sleeves
her
gown
flicked
her
wand
and
said
Wingardium
Leviosa
Their
feather
rose
off
the
desk
and
hovered
about
four
feet
above
their
heads
well
done
cried
Professor
Flitwick
clapping
Everyone
see
here
Miss
Granger
done
Ron
was
very
bad
mood
the
end
the
class
wonder
one
can
stand
her
said
Harry
they
pushed
their
way
into
the
crowded
corridor
she
nightmare
honestly
Someone
knocked
into
Harry
they
hurried
past
him
was
Hermione
Harry
caught
glimpse
her
face
and
was
startled
see
that
she
was
tears
think
she
heard
you
said
Ron
but
looked
bit
uncomfortable
She
must
noticed
she
got
friends
Hermione
didn
turn
for
the
next
class
and
wasn
seen
all
afternoon
their
way
down
the
Great
Hall
for
the
Halloween
feast
Harry
and
Ron
overheard
Parvati
Patil
telling
her
friend
Lavender
that
Hermione
was
crying
the
girls
bathroom
and
wanted
left
alone
Ron
looked
still
more
awkward
this
but
moment
later
they
had
entered
the
Great
Hall
where
the
Halloween
decorations
put
Hermione
out
their
minds
thousand
live
bats
fluttered
from
the
walls
and
ceiling
while
thousand
more
swooped
over
the
tables
low
black
clouds
making
the
candles
the
pumpkins
stutter
The
feast
appeared
suddenly
the
golden
plates
had
the
start
term
banquet
Harry
was
just
helping
himself
baked
potato
when
Professor
Quirrell
came
sprinting
into
the
hall
his
turban
askew
and
terror
his
face
Everyone
stared
reached
Professor
Dumbledore
chair
slumped
against
the
table
and
gasped
Troll
the
dungeons
thought
you
ought
know
then
sank
the
floor
dead
faint
There
was
uproar
took
several
purple
firecrackers
exploding
from
the
end
Professor
Dumbledore
wand
bring
silence
Prefects
rumbled

Excuse

How

Harry
asked
they
climbed
the
stairs
Don
ask
they
supposed
really
stupid
said
Ron
Maybe
Peeves
let
for
Halloween
joke
They
passed
different
groups
people
hurrying
different
directions
they
jostled
their
way
through
crowd
confused
Hufflepuffs
Harry
suddenly
grabbed
Ron
arm
just
thought
Hermione
What
about
her
She
doesn
know
about
the
troll
Ron
bit
his
lip
all
right
snapped
But
Percy
better
not
see
Ducking
down
they
joined
the
Hufflepuffs
going
the
other
way
slipped
down
deserted
side
corridor
and
hurried
off
toward
the
girls
bathroom
They
had
just
turned
the
corner
when
they
heard
quick
footsteps
behind
them
Percy
hissed
Ron
pulling
Harry
behind
large
stone
griffin
Peering
around
however
they
saw
not
Percy
but
Snape
crossed
the
corridor
and
disappeared
from
view
What
doing
Harry
whispered
Why
isn
down
the
dungeons
with
the
rest
the
teachers
Search
Quietly
possible
they
crept
along
the
next
corridor
after
Snape
fading
footsteps
heading
for
the
third
floor
Harry
said
but
Ron
held
his
hand
Can
you
smell
something
Harry
sniffed
and
foul
stench
reached
his
nostrils
mixture
old
socks
and
the
kind
public
toilet
one
seems
clean
And
then
they
heard
low
grunting
and
the
shuffling
footfalls
gigantic
feet
Ron
pointed
the
end
passage
the
left
something
huge
was
moving
toward
them
They
shrank
into
the
shadows
and
watched
emerged
into
patch
moonlight
was
horrible
sight
Twelve
feet
tall
its
skin
was
dull
granite
gray
its
great
lumpy
body
like
boulder
with
its
small
bald
head
perched
top
like
coconut
had
short
legs
thick
tree
trunks
with
flat
horny
feet
The
smell
coming
from
was
incredible
was
holding
huge
wooden
club
which
dragged
along
the
floor
because
its
arms
were
long
The
troll
stopped
next
doorway
and
peered
inside
waggled
its
long
ears
making
its
tiny
mind
then
slouched
slowly
into
the
room
The
keys
the
lock
Harry
muttered
could
lock
Good
idea
said
Ron
nervously
They
edged
toward
the
open
door
mouths
dry
praying
the
troll
wasn
about
come
out
With
one
great
leap
Harry
managed
grab
the
key
slam
the
door
and
lock
Yes
Flushed
with
their
victory
they
started
run
back
the
passage
but
they
reached
the
corner
they
heard
something
that
made
their
hearts
stop
high
petrified
scream
and
was
coming
from
the
chamber
they
just
chained
said
Ron
pale
the
Bloody
Baron
the
girls
bathroom
Harry
gasped
Hermione
they
said
together
was
the
last
thing
they
wanted
but
what
choice
did
they
have
Wheeling
around
they
sprinted
back
the
door
and
turned
the
key
fumbling
their
panic
Harry
pulled
the
door
open
and
they
ran
inside
Hermione
Granger
was
shrinking
against
the
wall
opposite
looking
she
was
about
faint
The
troll
was
advancing
her
knocking
the
sinks
off
the
walls
went
Confuse
Harry
said
desperately
Ron
and
seizing
tap
threw
hard
could
against
the
wall
The
troll
stopped
few
feet
from
Hermione
lumbered
around
blinking
stupidly
see
what
had
made
the
noise
Its
mean
little
eyes
saw
Harry
hesitated
then
made
for
him
instead
lifting
its
club
went
pea
brain
yelled
Ron
from
the
other
side
the
chamber
and
threw
metal
pipe
The
troll
didn
even
seem
notice
the
pipe
hitting
its
shoulder
but
heard
the
yell
and
paused
again
turning
its
ugly
snout
toward
Ron
instead
giving
Harry
time
run
around
Come
run
run
Harry
yelled
Hermione
trying
pull
her
toward
the
door
but
she
couldn
move
she
was
still
flat
against
the
wall
her
mouth
open
with
terror
The
shouting
and
the
echoes
seemed
driving
the
troll
berserk
roared
again
and
started
toward
Ron
who
was
nearest
and
had
way
escape
Harry
then
did
something
that
was
both
very
brave
and
very
stupid
took
great
running
jump
and
managed
fasten
his
arms
around
the
troll
neck
from
behind
The
troll
couldn
feel
Harry
hanging
there
but
even
troll
will
notice
you
stick
long
bit
wood
its
nose
and
Harry
wand
had
still
been
his
hand
when
jumped
had
gone
straight
one
the
troll
nostrils
Howling
with
pain
the
troll
twisted
and
flailed
its
club
with
Harry
clinging
for
dear
life
any
second
the
troll
was
going
rip
him
off
catch
him
terrible
blow
with
the
club
Hermione
had
sunk
the
floor
fright
Ron
pulled
out
his
own
wand
not
knowing
what
was
going
heard
himself
cry
the
first
spell
that
came
into
his
head
Wingardium
Leviosa
The
club
flew
suddenly
out
the
troll
hand
rose
high
high
into
the
air
turned
slowly
over
and
dropped
with
sickening
crack
onto
its
owner
head
The
troll
swayed
the
spot
and
then
fell
flat
its
face
with
thud
that
made
the
whole
room
tremble
Harry
got
his
feet
was
shaking
and
out
breath
Ron
was
standing
there
with
his
wand
still
raised
staring
what
had
done
was
Hermione
who
spoke
first
dead
don
think
said
Harry
think
just
been
knocked
out
bent
down
and
pulled
his
wand
out
the
troll
nose
was
covered
what
looked
like
lumpy
gray
glue
Urgh
troll
boogers
wiped
the
troll
trousers
sudden
slamming
and
loud
footsteps
made
the
three
them
look
They
hadn
realized
what
racket
they
had
been
making
but
course
someone
downstairs
must
have
heard
the
crashes
and
the
troll
roars
moment
later
Professor
McGonagall
had
come
bursting
into
the
room
closely
followed
Snape
with
Quirrell
bringing
the
rear
Quirrell
took
one
look
the
troll
let
out
faint
whimper
and
sat
quickly
down
toilet
clutching
his
heart
Snape
bent
over
the
troll
Professor
McGonagall
was
looking
Ron
and
Harry
Harry
had
never
seen
her
look
angry
Her
lips
were
white
Hopes
winning
fifty
points
for
Gryffindor
faded
quickly
from
Harry
mind
What
earth
were
you
thinking
said
Professor
McGonagall
with
cold
fury
her
voice
Harry
looked
Ron
who
was
still
standing
with
his
wand
the
air
You
lucky
you
weren
killed
Why
aren
you
your
dormitory
Snape
gave
Harry
swift
piercing
look
Harry
looked
the
floor
wished
Ron
would
put
his
wand
down
Then
small
voice
came
out
the
shadows
Please
Professor
McGonagall
they
were
looking
for
Miss
Granger
Hermione
had
managed
get
her
feet
last
went
looking
for
the
troll
because
thought
could
deal
with
own
you
know
because
read
all
about
them
Ron
dropped
his
wand
Hermione
Granger
telling
downright
lie
teacher
they
hadn
found
dead
now
Harry
stuck
his
wand
its
nose
and
Ron
knocked
out
with
its
own
club
They
didn
have
time
come
and
fetch
anyone
was
about
finish
off
when
they
arrived
Harry
and
Ron
tried
look
though
this
story
wasn
new
them
Well
that
case
said
Professor
McGonagall
staring
the
three
them
Miss
Granger
you
foolish
girl
how
could
you
think
tackling
mountain
troll
your
own
Hermione
hung
her
head
Harry
was
speechless
Hermione
was
the
last
person
anything
against
the
rules
and
here
she
was
pretending
she
had
get
them
out
trouble
was
Snape
had
started
handing
out
sweets
Miss
Granger
five
points
will
taken
from
Gryffindor
for
this
said
Professor
McGonagall
very
disappointed
you
you
not
hurt
all
you
better
get
off
Gryffindor
tower
Students
are
finishing
the
feast
their
houses
Hermione
left
Professor
McGonagall
turned
Harry
and
Ron
Well
still
say
you
were
lucky
but
not
many
first
years
could
have
taken
full
grown
mountain
troll
You
each
win
Gryffindor
five
points
Professor
Dumbledore
will
informed
this
You
may
They
hurried
out
the
chamber
and
didn
speak
all
until
they
had
climbed
two
floors
was
relief
away
from
the
smell
the
troll
quite
apart
from
anything
else
should
have
gotten
more
than
ten
points
Ron
grumbled
Five
you
mean
once
she
taken
off
Hermione
Good
her
get
out
trouble
like
that
Ron
admitted
Mind
you
did
save
her
She
might
not
have
needed
saving
hadn
locked
the
thing
with
her
Harry
reminded
him
They
had
reached
the
portrait
the
Fat
Lady
Pig
snout
they
said
and
entered
The
common
room
was
packed
and
noisy
Everyone
was
eating
the
food
that
had
been
sent
Hermione
however
stood
alone
the
door
waiting
for
them
There
was
very
embarrassed
pause
Then
none
them
looking
each
other
they
all
said
Thanks
and
hurried
off
get
plates
But
from
that
moment
Hermione
Granger
became
their
friend
There
are
some
things
you
can
share
without
ending
liking
each
other
and
knocking
out
twelve
foot
mountain
troll
one
them
CHAPTER
ELEVEN
QUIDDITCH
they
entered
November
the
weather
turned
very
cold
The
mountains
around
the
school
became
icy
gray
and
the
lake
like
chilled
steel
Every
morning
the
ground
was
covered
frost
Hagrid
could
seen
from
the
upstairs
windows
defrosting
broomsticks
the
Quidditch
field
bundled
long
moleskin
overcoat
rabbit
fur
gloves
and
enormous
beaverskin
boots
The
Quidditch
season
had
begun
Saturday
Harry
would
playing
his
first
match
after
weeks
training
Gryffindor
versus
Slytherin
Gryffindor
won
they
would
move
into
second
place
the
house
championship
Hardly
anyone
had
seen
Harry
play
because
Wood
had
decided
that
their
secret
weapon
Harry
should
kept
well
secret
But
the
news
that
was
playing
Seeker
had
leaked
out
somehow
and
Harry
didn
know
which
was
worse
people
telling
him
brilliant
people
telling
him
they
running
around
underneath
him
holding
mattress
was
really
lucky
that
Harry
now
had
Hermlone
friend
didn
know
how
have
gotten
through
all
his
homework
without
her
what
with
all
the
last
minute
Quidditch
practice
Wood
was
making
them
She
had
also
tent
him
Quidditch
Through
the
Ages
which
turned
out
very
interesting
read
Harry
learned
that
there
were
seven
hundred
ways
committing
Quidditch
foul
and
that
all
them
had
happened
during
World
Cup
match
1473
that
Seekers
were
usually
the
smallest
and
fastest
players
and
that
most
serious
Quidditch
accidents
seemed
happen
them
that
although
people
rarely
died
playing
Quidditch
referees
had
been
known
vanish
and
turn
months
later
the
Sahara
Desert
Hermione
had
become
bit
more
relaxed
about
breaking
rules
since
Harry
and
Ron
had
saved
her
from
the
mountain
troll
and
she
was
much
nicer
for
The
day
before
Harry
first
Quidditch
match
the
three
them
were
out
the
freezing
courtyard
during
break
and
she
had
conjured
them
bright
blue
fire
that
could
carried
around
jam
jar
They
were
standing
with
their
backs
getting
warm
when
Snape
crossed
the
yard
Harry
noticed
once
that
Snape
was
limping
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
moved
closer
together
block
the
fire
from
view
they
were
sure
wouldn
allowed
Unfortunately
something
about
their
guilty
faces
caught
Snape
eye
limped
over
hadn
seen
the
fire
but
seemed
looking
for
reason
tell
them
off
anyway
What
that
you
got
there
Potter
was
Quidditch
Through
the
Ages
Harry
showed
him
Library
books
are
not
taken
outside
the
school
said
Snape
Give
Five
points
from
Gryffindor
just
made
that
rule
Harry
muttered
angrily
Snape
limped
away
Wonder
what
wrong
with
his
leg
Dunno
but
hope
really
hurting
him
said
Ron
bitterly
The
Gryffindor
common
room
was
very
noisy
that
evening
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
together
next
window
Hermione
was
checking
Harry
and
Ron
Charms
homework
for
them
She
would
never
let
them
copy
How
will
you
learn
but
asking
her
read
through
they
got
the
right
answers
anyway
Harry
felt
restless
wanted
Quidditch
Through
the
Ages
back
take
his
mind
off
his
nerves
about
tomorrow
Why
should
afraid
Snape
Getting
told
Ron
and
Hermione
was
going
ask
Snape
could
have
Better

than
they
said
together
but
Harry
had
idea
that
Snape
wouldn
refuse
there
were
other
teachers
listening

his
way
down
the
staffroom
and
knocked
There
was
answer

again
Nothing
Perhaps
Snape
had
left
the
book
there
was
worth
try
pushed
the
door
ajar
and
peered
inside
and
horrible
scene
met
his
eyes
Snape
and
Filch
were
inside
alone
Snape
was
holding
his
robes
above
his
knees
One
his
legs
was
bloody
and
mangled
Filch
was
handing
Snape
bandages
Blasted
thing
Snape
was
saying
How
are
you
supposed
keep
your
eyes
all
three
heads
once
Harry
tried
shut
the
door
quietly
but
POTTER
Snape
face
was
twisted
with
fury
dropped
his
robes
quickly
hide
his
leg
Harry
gulped
just
wondered
could
have
book
back
GET
OUT
OUT
Harry
left
before
Snape
could
take
any
more
points
from
Gryffindor
sprinted
back
upstairs
Did

get
Ron
asked
Harry
joined
them
What
the
matter
low
whisper
Harry
told
them
what
seen
You
know
what
this
means
finished
breathlessly
tried
get
past
that
three
headed
dog
Halloween
That
where
was
going
when
saw
him
after
whatever
guarding
And
bet

let
that
troll
make

Hermione
eyes
were
wide

she
said

nice
but
wouldn
try
and

Dumbledore
was
keeping
safe
Honestly
Hermione

snapped
Ron
with
Harry
wouldn
put
anything
past
Snape
But
what

What
that
dog
guarding
Harry
went
bed
with
his
head
buzzing
with
the
same
question
Neville
was
snoring
loudly
but
Harry
couldn
sleep
tried
empty
his
mind
needed
sleep
had
had
his
first
Quidditch
match
few
hours
but
the
expression
Snape
face
when
Harry
had
seen
his
leg
wasn
easy
forget
The
next
morning
dawned
very
bright
and
cold
The
Great

was
full
the
delicious
smell
fried
sausages
and
the
cheer
ful
chatter
everyone
looking

Harry
watching
Seamus
pile
ketchup

sausages
eleven
clock
the
whole
school
seemed
out
the
stands
around
the
Quidditch
pitch
Many
students
had
binoculars
The
seats
might
raised
high
the
air
but
was
still
difficult

what
was
going
sometimes
Ron
and

done

Then
Hermione
had
performed
tricky

charm
that
the

flashed
different

Once

was
just
reflection
from
one
the
Weasleys
wristwatches
and
once
Bludger
decided

pelting
his
way
more
like
cannonball
than

but
Harry

through
the
crowd
Adrian
Pucey
dropped
the
Quaffle
too
busy
looking
over
his
shoulder
the
flash

Harry

But
all
the

the
Golden

Down

another
Bludger
which
went
spinning
dangerously
past
his
head
that

His
broom
gave
sudden
frightening
lurch
For
split
second
thought
was
going
fall
gripped
the
broom
tightly
with
both
his
hands
and
knees
never
felt
anything
like
that
happened
again
was
though
the
broom
was
trying
buck
him
off
But
Nimbus
Two
Thousands

not
suddenly
decide

their
riders
off
Harry
tried
turn
back
toward
the
Gryffindor
goal
posts
had
half
mind
ask
Wood
call
time
out
and
then
realized
that
his
broom
was
completely
out
his
control
couldn
turn
couldn
direct
all
was
zigzagging
through
the
air
and
every
now
and
then
making
violent
swishing
movements
that
almost
unseated
him
Lee
was
still
commentating

The

have
noticed
that
Harry
broom
was
behaving
strangely
was
carrying
him
slowly
higher
away
from
the
game
jerking
and
twitching
went
Dunno
what
Harry
thinks
doing
Hagrid
mumbled
stared
through
his
binoculars
didn
know
better
say
lost
control
his
broom
but
can
have
Suddenly
people
were
pointing
Harry
all
over
the
stands
His
broom
had
started
roll
over
and
over
with
him
only
just
managing
hold
Then
the
whole
crowd
gasped
Harry
broom
had
given
wild
jerk
and
Harry
swung
off
was
now
dangling
from
holding
with
only
one
hand
Did
something
happen
when
Flint
blocked
him
Seamus
whispered
Can
have
Hagrid
said
his
voice
shaking
Can
nothing

except
powerful
Dark
magic
kid

that
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
these
words
Hermione
seized
Hagrid
binoculars
but
instead
looking
Harry
she
started
looking
frantically
the
crowd
What

Ron
gray
faced

Hermione
gasped
Snape
look
Ron
grabbed
the
binoculars
Snape
was
the
middle
the
stands
opposite
them
had
his
eyes
fixed
Harry
and
was
muttering
nonstop
under
his
breath
doing
something
jinxing
the
broom
said
Hermione
What
should
Leave
Before
Ron
could
say
another
word
Hermione
had
disappeared
Ron
turned
the
binoculars
back
Harry
His
broom
was
vibrating
hard
was
almost
impossible
for
him
hang
much
longer
The
whole
crowd
was
its
feet
watching
terrified
the
Weasleys
flew
try
and
pull
Harry
safely
onto
one
their
brooms
but
was
good
every
time
they
got
near
him
the
broom
would
jump
higher
still
They
dropped
lower
and
circled
beneath
him
obviously
hoping
catch
him
fell
Marcus
Flint
seized
the
Quaffle
and
scored
five
times
without
anyone
noticing
Come
Hermione
Ron
muttered
desperately
Hermione
had
fought
her
way
across
the
stand
where
Snape
stood
and
was
now
racing
along
the
row
behind
him
she
didn
even
stop
say
sorry
she
knocked
Professor
Quirrell
headfirst
into
the
row
front
Reaching
Snape
she
crouched
down
pulled
out
her
wand
and
whispered
few
well
chosen
words
Bright
blue
flames
shot
from
her
wand
onto
the
hem
Snape
robes
took
perhaps
thirty
seconds
for
Snape
realize
that
was
fire
sudden
yelp
told
her
she
had
done
her
job
Scooping
the
fire
off
him
into
little
jar
her
pocket
she
scrambled
back
along
the
row
Snape
would
never
know
what
had
happened
was
enough
the
air
Harry
was
suddenly
able
clamber
back
his
broom
Neville

Ron
said
Neville

been
sobbing
into
Hagrid
jacket
for
the
last
five

the
field

and
something
gold
fell
into
his
hand

Snitch
shouted
waving
above
his
head
and
the
game
ended
complete
confusion
didn
catch
nearly
swallowed
Flint
was
still
howling
twenty
minutes
later
but
made
difference
Harry
hadn
broken
any

the
results

CHAPTER
TWELVE
THE
MIRROR
ERISED
Christmas
was
coming
One
morning
mid
December
Hogwarts
woke
find
itself
covered
several
feet
snow
The
lake
froze
solid
and
the
Weasley
twins
were
punished
for
bewitching
several
snowballs
that
they
followed
Quirrell
around
bouncing
off
the
back
his
turban
The
few
owls
that
managed
battle
their
way
through
the
stormy
sky
deliver
mail
had
nursed
back
health
Hagrid
before
they
could
fly
off
again
one
could
wait
for
the
holidays
start
While
the
Gryffindor
common
room
and
the
Great
Hall
had
roaring
fires
the
drafty
corridors
had
become
icy
and
bitter
wind
rattled
the
windows
the
classrooms
Worst
all
were
Professor
Snape
classes
down
the
dungeons
where
their
breath
rose
mist
before
them
and
they
kept
close
possible
their
hot
cauldrons
feel
sorry
said
Draco
Malfoy
one
Potions
class
for
all
those
people
who
have
stay
Hogwarts
for
Christmas
because
they
not
wanted
home
was
looking
over
Harry
spoke
Crabbe
and
Goyle
chuckled
Harry
who
was
measuring
out
powdered
spine
lionfish
ignored
them
Malfoy
had
been
even
more
unpleasant
than
usual
since
the
Quidditch
match
Disgusted
that
the
Slytherins
had
lost
had
tried
get
everyone
laughing
how
wide
mouthed
tree
frog
would
replacing
Harry
Seeker
next
Then
realized
that
nobody
found
this
funny
because
they
were
all
impressed
the
way
Harry
had
managed
stay
his
bucking
broomstick
Malfoy
jealous
and
angry
had
gone
back
taunting
Harry
about
having
proper
family
was
true
that
Harry
wasn
going
back
Privet
Drive
for
Christmas
Professor
McGonagall
had
come
around
the
week
before
making
list
students
who
would
staying
for
the
holidays
and
Harry
had
signed
once
didn
feel
sorry
for
himself
all
this
would
probably
the
best
Christmas
ever
had
Ron
and
his
brothers
were
staying
too
because
and
Mrs
Weasley
were
going
Romania
visit
Charlie
When
they
left
the
dungeons
the
end
Potions
they
found
large
fir
tree
blocking
the
corridor
ahead
Two
enormous
feet
sticking
out
the
bottom
and
loud
puffing
sound
told
them
that
Hagrid
was
behind
Hagrid
want
any
help
Ron
asked
sticking
his
head
through
the
branches
Nah
all
right
thanks
Ron
Would
you
mind
moving
out
the
way
came
Malfoys
cold
drawl
from
behind
them
Are
you
trying
earn
some
extra
money
Weasley
Hoping
gamekeeper
yourself
when
you
leave
Hogwarts
suppose

Hall
where
Professor

and
Professor
Flitwick
were
busy
with
the
Christmas
decorations
Hagrid
the
last
tree
put
the
far
corner
would
you
The
hall
looked
spectacular
Festoons
holly
and
mistletoe
hung
all
around
the
walls
and
less
than
twelve
towering
Christmas
trees
stood
around
the
room
some
sparkling
with
tiny
icicles
some
glittering
with
hundreds
candles
How
many
days

until

Hagrid
asked
Just

said
Hermione
And

reminds
Harry
Ron

hour
before

the
library

said
Ron
tearing
his
eyes
away
from
Professor
Flitwick
who
had
golden
bubbles
blossoming
out
his
wand
and
was
trailing
them
over
the
branches
the
new
tree
The
library
said
Hagrid
following
them
out
the
hall
Just
before
the
holidays
Bit
keen
aren
yeh
not
working
Harry
told
him
brightly
Ever
since
you

Nicolas
Flamel

trying

You

Hagrid
looked
shocked
Listen

just
want

Nicolas
Flamel
that
all

Hermione
Unless

Harry
added

through
hundreds
books
already
and

his
name
somewhere
sayin
nothin
said
Hagrid
flatly
Just
have
find
out
for
ourselves
then
said
Ron
and
they
left
Hagrid
looking
disgruntled
and
hurried
off
the
library
They
had
indeed
been
searching
books
for
Flamel
name
ever
since
Hagrid
had
let
slip
because
how
else
were
they
going
find
out
what
Snape
was
trying
steal
The
trouble
was
was
very
hard
know
where
begin
not
knowing
what
Flamel
might
have
done
get
himself
into
book
wasn
Great
Wizards
the
Twentieth
Century
Notable
Magical
Names
Our
Time
was
missing
too
from
Important
Modern
Magical
Discoveries
and
Study
Recent
Developments
Wizardry
And
then
course
there
was
the
sheer
size
the
library
tens
thousands
books
thousands
shelves
hundreds
narrow
rows
Hermione
took
out
list
subjects
and
titles
she
had
decided
search
while
Ron
strode
off
down
row
books
and
started
pulling
them
off
the
shelves
random
Harry
wandered
over
the
Restricted
Section
had
been
wondering
for
while
Flamel
wasn
somewhere
there
Unfortunately
you
needed
specially
signed
note
from
one
the
teachers
look
any
the
restricted
books
and
knew
never
get
one
These
were
the
books
containing
powerful
Dark
Magic
never
taught
Hogwarts
and
only
read
older
students
studying
advanced
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
What
are
you
looking
for
boy
Nothing
said
Harry
Madam
Pince
the
librarian
brandished
feather
duster
him
You
better
get
out
then
out
Wishing
been
bit
quicker
thinking
some
story
Harry
left
the
library
Ron
and
Hermione
had
already
agreed
they
better
not
ask
Madam
Pince
where
they
could
find
Flamel
They
were
sure
she
able
tell
them
but
they
couldn
risk
Snape
hearing
what
they
were
Harry
waited
outside
the
corridor
see
the
other
two
had
found
anything
but
wasn
very
hopeful
They
had
been
looking
for
two
weeks
after
but
they
only
had
odd
moments
between
lessons
wasn
surprising
they
found
nothing
What
they
really
needed
was
nice
long
search
without
Madam
Pince
breathing
down
their
necks
Five
minutes
later
Ron
and
Hermione
joined
him
shaking
their
heads
They
went
off
lunch
You
will
keep
looking
while
away
won
you
said
Hermione
And
send
owl
you
find
anything
And
you
could
ask
your
parents
they
know
who
Flamel
said
Ron
safe
ask
them
Very
safe
they
both
dentists
said
Hermione
Once
the
holidays
had
started
Ron
and
Harry
were
having
too
good
time
think
much
about
Flamel
They
had
the
dormitory
themselves
and
the
common
room
was
far
emptier
than
usual
they
were
able
get
the
good
armchairs
the
fire
They
sat
the
hour
eating
anything
they
could
spear
toasting
fork
bread
English
muffins
marshmallows
and
plotting
ways
getting
Malfoy
expelled
which
were
fun
talk
about
even
they
wouldn
work
Ron
also
started
teaching
Harry
wizard
chess
This
was
exactly
like
Muggle
chess
except
that
the
figures
were
alive
which
made
lot
like
directing
troops
battle
Ron
set
was
very
old
and
battered
Like
everything
else
owned
had
once
belonged
someone
else
his
family
this
case
his
grandfather
However
old
chessmen
weren
drawback
all
Ron
knew
them
well
never
had
trouble
getting
them
what
wanted
Harry
played
with
chessmen
Seamus
Finnigan
had
lent
him
and
they
didn
trust
him
all
wasn
very
good
player
yet
and
they
kept
shouting
different
bits
advice
him
which
was
confusing
Don
send
there
can
you
see
his
knight
Send
him
can
afford
lose
him
Christmas
Eve
Harry
went
bed
looking
forward
the
next
day
for
the
food
and
the
fun
but
not
expecting
any
presents
all
When
woke
early
the
morning
however
the
first
thing
saw
was
small
pile
packages
the
foot
his
bed
Merry

said
Ron
sleepily
Harry
scrambled
out
bed
and
pulled
his
bathrobe
You

Harry
Will

presents
What

said
Ron
turning
his
own
pile
which
was
lot
bigger
than
Harry
Harry
picked
the
top
parcel
was
wrapped
thick
brown
paper
and
scrawled
across
was
Harry
from
Hagrid
Inside
was
roughly
cut
wooden
flute
Hagrid
had
obviously
whittled
himself
Harry
blew
sounded
bit
like

very
small
parcel
contained
note

Harry
laughing
how

Ron

Hagrid

said
Ron
turning
bit
pink
and
pointing
very
lumpy
parcel
mom

groaned

Ron
unwrapping

That

said
Harry
trying
the
fudge
which
was
very
tasty
His
next
present
also
contained
candy
large
box
Chocolate
Frogs
from
Hermione
This
only
left
one
parcel
Harry
picked
and
felt
was
very
light
unwrapped
Something
fluid
and
silvery
gray
went
slithering
the
floor
where
lay
gleaming
folds
Ron
gasped
heard
those
said
hushed
voice
dropping
the
box
Every
Flavor
Beans
gotten
from
Hermione
that
what
think
they
really
rare
and
really
valuable
What
Harry
picked
the
shining
silvery
cloth
off
the
floor
was
strange
the
touch
like
water
woven
into
material
invisibility
cloak
said
Ron
look
awe
his
face
sure
try
Harry
threw
the
cloak
around
his
shoulders
and
Ron
gave
yell
Look
down
Harry
looked
down
his
feet
but
they
were
gone
dashed
the
mirror
Sure
enough
his
reflection
looked
back
him
just
his
head
suspended
midair
his
body
completely
invisible
pulled
the
cloak
over
his
head
and
his
reflection
vanished
completely
There
note
said
Ron
suddenly
note
fell
out
Harry
pulled
off
the
cloak
and
seized
the
letter
Written
narrow
loopy
writing

never
seen
before

the
following
words

Ron

Anything
What
the

Nothing
said
Harry
felt
very
strange
Who
had
sent
the
cloak
Had
really
once
belonged
his
father
Before
could
say
think
anything
else
the
dormitory
door
was
flung
open
and
Fred
and
George
Weasley
bounded
Harry
stuffed
the
cloak
quickly
out
sight
didn
feel
like
sharing
with
anyone
else
yet
Merry
Christmas
Hey

Fred
and
George

Fred

Ron
George
demanded

Ron

Percy
Weasley
stuck
his
head
through
the
door
looking
disapproving

clearly
gotten
halfway
through
unwrapping
his
presents
too
carried
lumpy
sweater
over
his
arm
which
Fred
seized
for
prefect
Get

Percy
thickly
the
twins
forced
the
sweater
over
his
head
knocking
his
glasses
askew
And

said
George
Christmas
time
for
family
They
frog
marched
Percy
from
the
room
his
arms
pinned
his
side
his
sweater
Harry
had
never
all
his
life
had
such
Christmas
dinner
hundred
fat
roast
turkeys
mountains
roast
and
boiled
potatoes
platters
chipolatas
tureens
buttered
peas
silver
boats
thick
rich
gravy
and
cranberry
sauce
and
stacks
wizard
crackers
every
few
feet
along
the
table
These
fantastic
party
favors
were
nothing
like
the
feeble
Muggle
ones
the
Dursleys
usually
bought
with
their
little
plastic
toys
and
their
flimsy
paper
hats
inside
Harry
pulled
wizard
cracker
with
Fred
and
didn
just
bang
went
off
with
blast
like
cannon
and
engulfed
them
all
cloud
blue
smoke
while
from
the
inside
exploded
rear
admiral
hat
and
several
live
white
mice
the
High
Table
Dumbledore
had
swapped
his
pointed
wizard
hat
for
flowered
bonnet
and
was
chuckling
merrily
joke
Professor
Flitwick
had
just
read
him
Flaming
Christmas
puddings
followed
the
turkey
Percy
nearly
broke
his
teeth
silver
sickle
embedded
his
slice
Harry
watched
Hagrid
getting
redder
and
redder
the
face
called
for
more
wine
finally
kissing
Professor
McGonagall
the
cheek
who
Harry
amazement
giggled
and
blushed
her
top
hat
lopsided
When
Harry
finally
left
the
table
was
laden
down
with
stack
things
out
the
crackers
including
pack
nonexplodable
luminous
balloons
Grow
Your
Own
Warts
kit
and
his
own
new
wizard
chess
set
The
white
mice
had
disappeared
and
Harry
had
nasty
feeling
they
were
going
end
Mrs
Norris
Christmas
dinner
Harry
and
the
Weasleys
spent
happy
afternoon
having
furious
snowball
fight
the
grounds
Then
cold
wet
and
gasping
for
breath
they
returned
the
fire
the
Gryffindor
common
room
where
Harry
broke
his
new
chess
set
losing
spectacularly
Ron
suspected
wouldn
have
lost
badly
Percy
hadn
tried
help
him
much
After
meal
turkey
sandwiches
crumpets
trifle
and
Christmas
cake
everyone
felt
too
full
and
sleepy
much
before
bed
except
sit
and
watch
Percy
chase
Fred
and
George
all
over
Gryffindor
tower
because
they
stolen
his
prefect
badge
had
been
Harry
best
Christmas
day
ever
Yet
something
had
been
nagging
the
back
his
mind
all
day
Not
until
climbed
into
bed
was
free
think
about
the
invisibility
cloak
and
whoever
had
sent
Ron
full
turkey
and
cake
and
with
nothing
mysterious
bother
him
fell
asleep
almost
soon
drawn
the
curtains
his
four
poster
Harry
leaned
over
the
side
his
own
bed
and
pulled
the
cloak
out
from
under
His
father
this
had
been
his
father
let
the
material
flow
over
his
hands
smoother
than
silk
light
air
Use
well
the
note
had
said
had
try
now
slipped
out
bed
and
wrapped
the
cloak
around
himself
Looking
down
his
legs
saw
only
moonlight
and
shadows
was
very
funny
feeling
Use
well
Suddenly
Harry
felt
wide
awake
The
whole
Hogwarts
was
open
him
this
cloak
Excitement
flooded
through
him
stood
there
the
dark
and
silence
could
anywhere
this
anywhere
and
Filch
would
never
know
Ron
grunted
his
sleep
Should
Harry
wake
him
Something
held
him
back
his
father
cloak
felt
that
this
time
the
first
time
wanted
use
alone
crept
out
the
dormitory
down
the
stairs
across
the
common
room
and
climbed
through
the
portrait
hole
Who
there
squawked
the
Fat
Lady
Harry
said
nothing
walked
quickly
down
the
corridor
Where
should
stopped
his
heart
racing
and
thought
And
then
came
him
The
Restricted
Section
the
library
able
read
long
liked
long
took
find
out
who
Flamel
was
set
off
drawing
the
invisibility
cloak
tight
around
him
walked
The
library
was
pitch
black
and
very
eerie
Harry
lit
lamp
see
his
way
along
the
rows
books
The
lamp
looked
was
floating
along
midair
and
even
though
Harry
could
feel
his
arm
supporting
the
sight
gave
him
the
creeps
The
Restricted
Section
was
right
the
back
the
library
Step
ping
carefully
over
the
rope
that
separated
these
books
from
the
rest
the
library
held
his
lamp
read
the
titles
They
didn
tell
him
much
Their
peeling
faded
gold
letters
spelled
words
languages
Harry
couldn
understand
Some
had
title
all
One
book
had
dark
stain
that
looked
horribly
like
blood
The
hairs
the
back
Harry
neck
prickled
Maybe
was
imagining
maybe
not
but
thought
faint
whispering
was
coming
from
the
books
though
they
knew
someone
was
there
who
shouldn
had
start
somewhere
Setting
the
lamp
down
carefully
the
floor
looked
along
the
bottom
shelf
for
interestinglooking
book
large
black
and
silver
volume
caught
his
eye
pulled
out
with
difficulty
because
was
very
heavy
and
balancing
his
knee
let
fall
open
piercing
bloodcurdling
shriek
split
the
silence
the
book
was
screaming
Harry
snapped
shut
but
the
shriek
went
and
one
high
unbroken
earsplitting
note
stumbled
backward
and
knocked
over
his
lamp
which
went
out
once
Panicking
heard
footsteps
coming
down
the
corridor
outside
stuffing
the
shrieking
book
back
the
shelf
ran
for
passed
Filch
the
doorway
Filch
pale
wild
eyes
looked
straight
through
him
and
Harry
slipped
under
Filch
outstretched
arm
and
streaked
off
the
corridor
the
book
shrieks
still
ringing
his
ears
came
sudden
halt
front
tall
suit
armor
had
been
busy
getting
away
from
the
library
hadn
paid
attention
where
was
going
Perhaps
because
was
dark
didn
recognize
where
was
all
There
was
suit
armor
near
the
kitchens
knew
but
must
five
floors
above
there
You
asked
come
directly
you
Professor
anyone
was
wandering
around
night
and
somebody
been
the
library
Restricted
Section
Harry
felt
the
blood
drain
out
his
face
Wherever
was
Filch
must
know
shortcut
because
his
soft
greasy
voice
was
getting
nearer
and
his
horror
was
Snape
who
replied
The
Restricted
Section
Well
they
can
far
catch
them
Harry
stood
rooted
the
spot
Filch
and
Snape
came
around
the
corner
ahead
They
couldn
see
him
course
but
was
narrow
corridor
and
they
came
much
nearer
they
knock
right
into
him
the
cloak
didn
stop
him
from
being
solid
backed
away
quietly
could
door
stood
ajar
his
left
was
his
only
hope
squeezed
through
holding
his
breath
trying
not
move
and
his
relief
managed
get
inside
the
room
without
their
noticing
anything
They
walked
straight
past
and
Harry
leaned
against
the
wall
breathing
deeply
listening
their
footsteps
dying
away
That
had
been
close
very
close
was
few
seconds
before
noticed
anything
about
the
room
had
hidden
looked
like
unused
classroom
The
dark
shapes
desks
and
chairs
were
piled
against
the
walls
and
there
was
upturned
wastepaper
basket
but
propped
against
the
wall
facing
him
was
something
that
didn
look
belonged
there
something
that
looked
someone
had
just
put
there
keep
out
the
way
was
magnificent
mirror
high
the
ceiling
with
ornate
gold
frame
standing
two
clawed
feet
There
was
inscription
carved
around
the
top
Erised
stra
ehru
oyt
ube
cafru
oyt

His
panic
fading
now
that
there
was
sound
Filch
and
Snape
Harry
moved
nearer
the
mirror
wanting
look
himself
but
see
reflection
again
stepped
front
had
clap
his
hands
his
mouth
stop
himself
from
screaming
whirled
around
His
heart
was
pounding
far
more
furiously
than
when
the
book
had
screamed
for
had
seen
not
only
himself
the
mirror
but
whole
crowd
people
standing
right
behind
him
But
the
room
was
empty
Breathing
very
fast
turned
slowly
back
the
mirror
There
was
reflected
white
and
scared
looking
and
there
reflected
behind
him
were
least
ten
others
Harry
looked
over
his
shoulder
but
still
one
was
there
were
they
all
invisible
too
Was
fact
room
full
invisible
people
and
this
mirror
trick
was
that
reflected
them
invisible
not
looked
the
mirror
again
woman
standing
right
behind
his
reflection
was
smiling
him
and
waving
reached
out
hand
and
felt
the
air
behind
him
she
was
really
there
touch
her
their
reflections
were
close
together
but
felt
only
air
she
and
the
others
existed
only
the
mirror
She
was
very
pretty
woman
She
had
dark
red
hair
and
her
eyes
her
eyes
are
just
like
mine
Harry
thought
edging
little
closer
the
glass
Bright
green
exactly
the
same
shape
but
then
noticed
that
she
was
crying
smiling
but
crying
the
same
time
The
tall
thin
black
haired
man
standing
next
her
put
his
arm
around
her
wore
glasses
and
his
hair
was
very
untidy
stuck
the
back
just
Harry
did
Harry
was
close
the
mirror
now
that
his
nose
was
nearly
touching
that
his
reflection
Mom
whispered
Dad
They
just
looked
him
smiling
And
slowly
Harry
looked
into
the
faces
the
other
people
the
mirror
and
saw
other
pairs
green
eyes
like
his
other
noses
like
his
even
little
old
man
who
looked
though
had
Harry
knobbly
knees
Harry
was
looking
his
family
for
the
first
time
his
life
The
Potters
smiled
and
waved
Harry
and
stared
hungrily
back
them
his
hands
pressed
flat
against
the
glass
though
was
hoping
fall
right
through
and
reach
them
had
powerful
kind
ache
inside
him
half
joy
half
terrible
sadness
How
long
stood
there
didn
know
The
reflections
did
not
fade
and
looked
and
looked
until
distant
noise
brought
him
back
his
senses
couldn
stay
here
had
find
his
way
back
bed
tore
his
eyes
away
from
his
mother
face
whispered
come
back
and
hurried
from
the
room
You
could
have
woken
said
Ron
crossly
You
can
come
tonight
going
back
want
show
you
the
mirror
like
see
your
mom
and
dad
Ron
said
eagerly
And
want
see
all
your
family
all
the
Weasleys
you
able
show
your
other
brothers
and
everyone
You
can
see
them
any
old
time
said
Ron
Just
come
round
house
this
summer
Anyway
maybe
only
shows
dead
people
Shame
about
not
finding
Flamel
though
Have
some
bacon
something
why
aren
you
eating
anything
Harry
couldn
eat
had
seen
his
parents
and
would
seeing
them
again
tonight
had
almost
forgotten
about
Flamel
didn
seem
very
important
anymore
Who
cared
what
the
three
headed
dog
was
guarding
What
did
matter
Snape
stole
really
Are
you
all
right
said
Ron
You
look
odd
What
Harry
feared
most
was
that
might
not
able
find
the
mirror
room
again
With
Ron
covered
the
cloak
too
they
had
walk
much
more
slowly
the
next
night
They
tried
retracing
Harry
route
from
the
library
wandering
around
the
dark
passageways
for
nearly
hour
freezing
said
Ron
Let
forget
and
back
Harry
hissed
know
here
somewhere
They
passed
the
ghost
tall
witch
gliding
the
opposite
direction
but
saw
one
else
just
Ron
started
moaning
that
his
feet
were
dead
with
cold
Harry
spotted
the
suit
armor
here
just
here
yes
They
pushed
the
door
open
Harry
dropped
the
cloak
from
around
his
shoulders
and
ran
the
mirror
There
they
were
His
mother
and
father
beamed
the
sight
him
See
Harry
whispered
can
see
anything
Look
Look
them
all
there
are
loads
them
can
only
see
you
Look
properly
stand
where
Harry
stepped
aside
but
with
Ron
front
the
mirror
couldn
see
his
family
anymore
just
Ron
his
paisley
pajamas
Ron
though
was
staring
transfixed
his
image
Look
said
Can
you
see
all
your
family
standing
around
you
alone
but
different
look
older
and
head
boy
What
wearing
the
badge
like
Bill
used
and
holding
the
house
cup
and
the
Quidditch
cup
Quidditch
captain
too
Ron
tore
his
eyes
away
from
this
splendid
sight
look
excitedly
Harry
you
think
this
mirror
shows
the
future
How
can
All
family
are
dead
let
have
another
look
You
had
yourself
all
last
night
give
bit
more
time
You
only
holding
the
Quidditch
cup
what
interesting
about
that
want
see
parents
Don
push
sudden
noise
outside
the
corridor
put
end
their
discussion
They
hadn
realized
how
loudly
they
had
been
talking
Quick
Ron
threw
the
cloak
back
over
them
the
luminous
eyes
Mrs
Norris
came
round
the
door
Ron
and
Harry
stood
quite
still
both
thinking
the
same
thing
did
the
cloak
work
cats
After
what
seemed
age
she
turned
and
left
This
isn
safe
she
might
have
gone
for
Filch
bet
she
heard
Come
And
Ron
pulled
Harry
out
the
room
The
snow
still
hadn
melted
the
next
morning
Want
play
chess
Harry
said
Ron
Why
don
down
and
visit
Hagrid
you
know
what
you
thinking
about
Harry
that
mirror
Don
back
tonight
Why
not
dunno
just
got
bad
feeling
about
and
anyway
you
had
too
many
close
shaves
already
Filch
Snape
and
Mrs
Norris
are
wandering
around
what
they
can
see
you
What
they
walk
into
you
What
you
knock
something
over
You
sound
like
Hermione
serious
Harry
don
But
Harry
only
had
one
thought
his
head
which
was
get
back
front
the
mirror
and
Ron
wasn
going
stop
him
That
third
night
found
his
way
more
quickly
than
before
was
walking
fast
knew
was
making
more
noise
than
was
wise
but
didn
meet
anyone
And
there
were
his
mother
and
father
smiling
him
again
and
one
his
grandfathers
nodding
happily
Harry
sank
down
sit
the
floor
front
the
mirror
There
was
nothing
stop
him
from
staying
here
all
night
with
his
family
Nothing
all
Except
back
again
Harry
Harry
felt
though
his
insides
had
turned
ice
looked
behind
him
Sitting
one
the
desks
the
wall
was
none
other
than
Albus
Dumbledore
Harry
must
have
walked
straight
past
him
desperate
get
the
mirror
hadn
noticed
him
didn
see
you
sir
Strange
how
nearsighted
being
invisible
can
make
you
said
Dumbledore
and
Harry
was
relieved
see
that
was
smiling
said
Dumbledore
slipping
off
the
desk
sit
the
floor
with
Harry
you
like
hundreds
before
you
have
discovered
the
delights
the
Mirror
Erised
didn
know
was
called
that
Sir
But
expect
you
realized
now
what
does
well
shows
family
And
showed
your
friend
Ron
himself
head
boy
How
did
you
know
don
need
cloak
become
invisible
said
Dumbledore
gently
Now
can
you
think
what
the
Mirror
Erised
shows
all
Harry
shook
his
head
Let
explain
The
happiest
man
earth
would
able
use
the
Mirror
Erised
like
normal
mirror
that
would
look
into
and
see
himself
exactly
Does
that
help
Harry
thought
Then
said
slowly
shows
what
want
whatever
want
Yes
and
said
Dumbledore
quietly
shows
nothing
more
less
than
the
deepest
most
desperate
desire
our
hearts
You
who
have
never
known
your
family
see
them
standing
around
you
Ronald
Weasley
who
has
always
been
overshadowed
his
brothers
sees
himself
standing
alone
the
best
all
them
However
this
mirror
will
give
neither
knowledge
truth
Men
have
wasted
away
before
entranced
what
they
have
seen
been
driven
mad
not
knowing
what
shows
real
even
possible
The
Mirror
will
moved
new
home
tomorrow
Harry
and
ask
you
not
looking
for
again
you
ever
run
across
you
will
now
prepared
does
not
dwell
dreams
and
forget
live
remember
that
Now
why
don
you
put
that
admirable
cloak
back
and
get
off
bed
Harry
stood
Sir
Professor
Dumbledore
Can
ask
you
something
Obviously
you
just
done
Dumbledore
smiled
You
may
ask
one
more
thing
however
What
you
see
when
you
look
the
mirror
see
myself
holding
pair
thick
woolen
socks
Harry
stared
One
can
never
have
enough
socks
said
Dumbledore
Another
Christmas
has
come
and
gone
and
didn
get
single
pair
People
will
insist
giving
books
was
only
when
was
back
bed
that
struck
Harry
that
Dumbledore
might
not
have
been
quite
truthful
But
then
thought
shoved
Scabbers
off
his
pillow
had
been
quite
personal
question
CHAPTER
THIRTEEN
NICOLAS
FLAMEL
Dumbledore
had
convinced
Harry
not
looking
for
the
Mirror
Erised
again
and
for
the
rest
the
Christmas
holidays
the
invisibility
cloak
stayed
folded
the
bottom
his
trunk
Harry
wished
could
forget
what
seen
the
mirror
easily
but
couldn
started
having
nightmares
Over
and
over
again
dreamed
about
his
parents
disappearing
flash
green
light
while
high
voice
cackled
with
laughter
You
see
Dumbledore
was
right
that
mirror
could
drive
you
mad
said
Ron
when
Harry
told
him
about
these
drearns
Hermione
who
came
back
the
day
before
term
started
took
different
view
things
She
was
torn
between
horror
the
idea
Harry
being
out
bed
roaming
the
school
three
nights
row
Filch
had
caught
you
and
disappointment
that
hadn
least
found
out
who
Nicolas
Flamel
was
They
had
almost
given
hope
ever
finding
Flamel
brary
book
even
though
Harry
was
still
sure
read
the
name
somewhere
Once
term
had
started
they
were
back
skimming
through
books
for
ten
minutes
during
their
breaks
Harry
had
even
less
time
than
the
other
two
because
Quidditch
practice
had
started
again
Wood
was
working
the
team
harder
than
ever
Even
the
endless
rain
that
had
replaced
the
snow
couldn
dampen
his
spirits
The
Weasleys
complained
that
Wood
was
becoming
fanatic
but
Harry
was
Wood
side
they
won
their
next
match
against
Hufflepuff
they
would
overtake
Slytherin
the
house
championship
for
the
first
time
seven
years
Quite
apart
from
wanting
win
Harry
found
that
had
fewer
nightmares
when
was
tired
out
after
training
Then
during
one
particularly
wet
and
muddy
practice
session
Wood
gave
the
team
bit
bad
news
just
gotten
very
angry
with
the
Weasleys
who
kept
dive
bombing
each
other
and
pretending
fall
off
their
brooms
Will
you
stop
messing
around
yelled
That
exactly
the
sort
thing
that
lose
the
match
Snape
refereeing
this
time
and
looking
for
any
excuse
knock
points
off
Gryffindor
George
Weasley
really
did
fall
off
his
broom
these
words
Snape
refereeing
spluttered
through
mouthful
mud
When
ever
refereed
Quidditch
match
not
going
fair
might
overtake
Slytherin
The
rest
the
team
landed
next
George
complain
too
not
fault
said
Wood
just
got
make
sure
play
clean
game
Snape
hasn
got
excuse
pick
Which
was
all
very
well
thought
Harry
but
had
another
reason
for
not
wanting
Snape
near
him
while
was
playing
Quidditch
The
rest
the
team
hung
back
talk
one
another
usual
the
end
practice
but
Harry
headed
straight
back
the
Gryffindor
common
room
where
found
Ron
and
Hermione
playing
chess
Chess
was
the
only
thing
Hermione
ever
lost
something
Harry
and
Ron
thought
was
very
good
for
her
Don
talk
for
moment
said
Ron
when
Harry
sat
down
next
him
need

What

Speaking
quietly

other
two
about

Hermione
once

Ron

said
Harry
There

that
moment
Neville
toppled
into
the
common
room
How
had
managed
climb
through
the
portrait
hole
was
anyone
guess
because
his
legs
had
been
stuck
together
with
what
they
recognized
once
the
Leg
Locker
Curse
must
have
had
bunny
hop
all
the
way
Gryffindor

Everyone
fell
over
laughing
except
Hermione
who
leapt
and
performed
the
countercurse
Neville

sprang
apart
and
got
his
feet
trembling
What
happened
Hermione
asked
him
leading
him
over
sit
with
Harry
and
Ron
Malfoy
said
Neville
shakily
met
him

the
library
said

Professor
McGonagall
Hermione
urged
Neville

Neville
shook
his
head

mumbled
You

Neville
said
Ron
used
walking
all
over
people
but
that
reason
lie
down
front
him
and
make
easier
There

tell
not

Neville
choked

Harry
felt
the
pocket
his
robes
and
pulled
out
Chocolate

the
very
last

from
the
box
Hermione
had
given
him
for
Christmas
gave
Neville
who
looked

might
cry
You

Harry
said

Neville
walked
away
Harry
looked
the
Famous
Wizard
card
Dumbledore

said
was
the
first
one
ever
gasped
stared
the
back
the
card
Then
looked
Ron
and
Hermione
found
him
whispered

Flamel

the

somewhere
before

the

Dumbledore
particularly
famous
for
his

for
the
discovery
the
twelve
uses

blood
and
his
work
alchemy
with
his
partner
Nicolas
Flamel
Hermione
jumped
her
feet
She
hadn
looked
excited
since
they
gotten
back
the
marks
for
their
very
first
piece
homework
Stay
there
she
said
and
she
sprinted
the
stairs
the
girls
dormitories
Harry
and
Ron
barely
had
time
exchange
mystified
looks
before
she
was
dashing
back
enormous
old
book

arms

thought
look
here
she
whispered
excitedly
got
this
out
the
library
weeks
ago
for
bit
light
reading
Light
said
Ron
but
Hermione
told
him
quiet
until
she
looked
something
and
started
flicking
frantically
through
the
pages
muttering
herself
last
she
found
what
she
was
looking
for
knew
knew
Are
allowed
speak
yet
said
Ron
grumpily
Hermione
ignored
him
Nicolas
Flamel
she
whispered
dramatically
the
only
known
maker
the
Sorcerer
Stone
This
didn
have
quite
the
effect
she
expected
The
what
said
Harry
and
Ron
honestly
don
you
two
read
Look
read
that
there
She
pushed
the
book
toward
them
and
Harry
and
Ron
read
The
ancient

the
Sorcerer
Stone

powers
The
stone

the
Elixir
Life
which

There

The
next
morning
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
while
copying
down
different
ways
treating
werewolf
bites
Harry
and
Ron
were
still
discussing
what
they
with
Sorcerer
Stone
they
had
one
wasn
until
Ron
said
buy
his
own
Quidditch
team
that
Harry
remembered
about
Snape
and
the
coming
match
going
play
told
Ron
and
Hermione
don
all
the
Slytherins
will
think
just
too
scared
face
Snape
show
them
really
wipe
the
smiles
off
their
faces
win
Just
long
not
wiping
you
off
the
field
said
Hermione
the
match
drew
nearer
however
Harry
became
more
and
more
nervous
whatever
told
Ron
and
Hermione
The
rest
the
team
wasn
too
calm
either
The
idea
overtaking
Slytherin
the
house
championship
was
wonderful
one
had
done
for
seven
years
but
would
they
allowed
with
such
biased
referee
Harry
didn
know
whether
was
imagining
not
but
seemed
keep
running
into
Snape
wherever
went
times
even
wondered
whether
Snape
was
following
him
trying
catch
him
his
own
Potions
lessons
were
turning
into
sort
weekly
torture
Snape
was
horrible
Harry
Could
Snape
possibly
know
they
found
out
about
the
Sorcerer
Stone
Harry
didn
see
how
could
yet
sometimes
had
the
horrible
feeling
that
Snape
could
read
minds
Harry
knew
when
they
wished
him
good
luck
outside
the
locker
rooms
the
next
afternoon
that
Ron
and
Hermione
were
wondering
whether
they
ever
see
him
alive
again
This
wasn
what
you
call
comforting
Harry
hardly
heard
word
Wood
pep
talk
pulled
his
Quidditch
robes
and
picked
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
Ron
and
Hermione
meanwhile
had
found
place
the
stands
next
Neville
who
couldn
understand
why
they
looked
grim
and
worried
why
they
had
both
brought
their
wands
the
match
Little
did
Harry
know
that
Ron
and
Hermione
had
been
secretly
practicing
the
Leg
Locker
Curse
They
gotten
the
idea
from
Malfoy
using
Neville
and
were
ready
use
Snape
showed
any
sign
wanting
hurt
Harry
Now
don
forget
Locomotor
Mortis
Hermione
muttered
Ron
slipped
his
wand
his
sleeve
know
Ron
snapped
Don
nag
Back
the
locker
room
Wood
had
taken
Harry
aside
Don
want
pressure
you
Potter
but
ever
need
early
capture
the
Snitch
now
Finish
the
game
before
Snape
can
favor
Hufflepuff
too
much
The
whole
school
out
there
said
Fred
Weasley
peering
out
the
door
Even
blimey
Dumbledore
come
watch
Harry
heart
did
somersault
Dumbledore
said
dashing
the
door
make
sure
Fred
was
right
There
was
mistaking
that
silver
beard
Harry
could
have
laughed
out
loud
with
relief
was
safe
There
was
simply
way
that
Snape
would
dare
try
hurt
him
Dumbledore
was
watching
Perhaps
that
was
why
Snape
was
looking
angry
the
teams
marched
onto
the
field
something
that
Ron
noticed
too
never
seen
Snape
look
mean
told
Hermione
Look
they
off
Ouch
Someone
had
poked
Ron
the
back
the
head
was
Malfoy
sorry
Weasley
didn
see
you
there
Malfoy
grinned
broadly
Crabbe
and
Goyle
Wonder
how
long
Potter
going
stay
his
broom
this
time
Anyone
want
bet
What
about
you
Weasley
Ron
didn
answer
Snape
had
just
awarded
Hufflepuff
penalty
because
George
Weasley
had
hit
Bludger
him
Hermione
who
had
all
her
fingers
crossed
her
lap
was
squinting
fixedly
Harry
who
was
circling
the
game
like
hawk
looking
for
the
Snitch
You
know
how
think
they
choose
people
for
the
Gryffindor
team
said
Malfoy
loudly
few
minutes
later
Snape
awarded
Hufflepuff
another
penalty
for
reason
all
people
they
feel
sorry
for
See
there
Potter
who
got
parents
then
there
the
Weasleys
who
got
money
you
should
the
team
Longbottom
you
got
brains
Neville
went
bright
red
but
turned
his
seat
face
Malfoy
worth
twelve
you
Malfoy
stammered
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
howled
with
laughter
but
Ron
still
not
daring
take
his
eyes
from
the
game
said
You
tell
him
Neville
Longbottom
brains
were
gold
you
poorer
than
Weasley
and
that
saying
something
Ron
nerves
were
already
stretched
the
breaking
point
with
anxiety
about
Harry
warning
you
Malfoy
one
more
word
Ron
said
Hermione
suddenly
Harry
What
Where
Harry
had
suddenly
gone
into
spectacular
dive
which
drew
gasps
and
cheers
from
the
crowd
Hermione
stood
her
crossed
fingers
her
mouth
Harry
streaked
toward
the
ground
like
bullet
You
luck
Weasley
Potter
obviously
spotted
some
money
the
ground
said
Malfoy
Ron
snapped
Before
Malfoy
knew
what
was
happening
Ron
was
top
him
wrestling
him
the
ground
Neville
hesitated
then
clambered
over
the
back
his
seat
help
Come
Harry
Hermione
screamed
leaping
onto
her
seat
watch
Harry
sped
straight
Snape
she
didn
even
notice
Malfoy
and
Ron
rolling
around
under
her
seat
the
scuffles
and
yelps
coming
from
the
whirl
fists
that
was
Neville
Crabbe
and
Goyle
the
air
Snape
turned
his
broomstick
just
time
see
something
scarlet
shoot
past
him
missing
him
inches
the
next
second
Harry
had
pulled
out
the
dive
his
arm
raised
triumph
the
Snitch
clasped
his
hand
The
stands
erupted
had
record
one
could
ever
remember
the
Snitch
being
caught
quickly
Ron
Ron
Where
are
you
The
game
over
Harry
won
won
Gryffindor
the
lead
shrieked
Hermione
dancing
and
down
her
seat
and
hugging
Parvati
Patil
the
row
front
Harry
jumped
off
his
broom
foot
from
the
ground
couldn
believe
done
the
game
was
over
had
barely
lasted
five
minutes
Gryffindors
came
spilling
onto
the
field
saw
Snape
land
nearby
white
faced
and
tight
lipped
then
Harry
felt
hand
his
shoulder
and
looked
into
Dumbledore
smiling
face
Well
done
said
Dumbledore
quietly
that
only
Harry
could
hear
Nice
see
you
haven
been
brooding
about
that
mirror
been
keeping
busy
excellent
Snape
spat
bitterly
the
ground
Harry
left
the
locker
room
alone
some
time
later
take
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
back
the
broomshed
couldn
ever
remember
feeling
happier
really
done
something
proud
now
one
could
say
was
just
famous
name
any
more
The
evening
air
had
never
smelled
sweet
walked
over
the
damp
grass
reliving
the
last
hour
his
head
which
was
happy
blur
Gryffindors
running
lift
him
onto
their
shoulders
Ron
and
Hermione
the
distance
jumping
and
down
Ron
cheering
through
heavy
nosebleed
Harry
had
reached
the
shed
leaned
against
the
wooden
door
and
looked
Hogwarts
with
its
windows
glowing
red
the
setting
sun
Gryffindor
the
lead
done
shown
Snape
And
speaking
Snape
hooded
figure
came
swiftly
down
the
front
steps
the
castle
Clearly
not
wanting
seen
walked
fast
possible
toward
the
forbidden
forest
Harry
victory
faded
from
his
mind
watched
recognized
the
figure
prowling
walk
Snape
sneaking
into
the
forest
while
everyone
else
was
dinner
what
was
going
Harry
jumped
back
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
and
took
off
Gliding
silently
over
the
castle
saw
Snape
enter
the
forest
run
followed
The
trees
were
thick
couldn
see
where
Snape
had
gone
flew
circles
lower
and
lower
brushing
the
top
branches
trees
until
heard
voices
glided
toward
them
and
landed
noiselessly
towering
beech
tree
climbed
carefully
along
one
the
branches
holding
tight
his
broomstick
trying
see
through
the
leaves
Below
shadowy
clearing
stood
Snape
but
wasn
alone
Quirrell
was
there
too
Harry
couldn
make
out
the
look
his
face
but
was
stuttering
worse
than
ever
Harry
strained
catch
what
they
were
saying

Snape
his
voice
icy
Students

Stone
after

Harry
leaned
forward
Quirrell
was
mumbling
something
Snape
interrupted
him

but
Severus

Quirrell
said
Snape
taking

toward
him

owl
hooted
loudly
and
Harry
nearly

himself
time

chat
soon
when

time
think
things
over
and
decided
where
your
loyalties
lie
threw
his
cloak
over
his
head
and
strode
out
the
clearing
was
almost
dark
now
but
Harry
could
see
Quirrell
standing
quite
still
though
was
petrified
Harry
where
have
you
been
Hermione
squeaked
won
You

shouted
Ron
thumping
Harry
the
back
And
gave
Malfoy
black
eye
and
Neville
tried
take
Crabbe
and
Goyle
single
handed
still
out
cold
but
Madam
Pomftey
says

Everyone

Quirrell

Quirrell

anti
Dark

CHAPTER
FOURTEEN
NORBERT
THE
NORWEGIAN
RIDGEBACK
Quirrell
however
must
have
been
braver
than
they
thought
the
weeks
that
followed
did
seem
getting
paler
and
thinner
but
didn
look
though
cracked
yet
Every
time
they
passed
the
third
floor
corridor
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
would
press
their
ears
the
door
check
that
Fluffy
was
still
growling
inside
Snape
was
sweeping
about
his
usual
bad
temper
which
surely
meant
that
the
Stone
was
still
safe
Whenever
Harry
passed
Quirrell
these
days
gave
him
encouraging
sort
smile
and
Ron
had
started
telling
people
off
for
laughing
Quirrell
stutter
Hermione
however
had
more
her
mind
than
the
Sorcerer
Stone
She
had
started
drawing
study
schedules
and
colorcoding
all
her
notes
Harry
and
Ron
wouldn
have
minded
but
she
kept
nagging
them
the
same
Hermione

Ten

Hermione
snapped
That

lines
Hermione
They

their
free
time
the
library
with
her
trying
get
through
all
their
extra
work
never
remember
this
Ron
burst
out
one
afternoon
throwing
down
his
quill
and
looking
longingly
out
the
library
window
was
the
first
really
fine

break
When
the
bell
sounded
from
the
castle
the
end
their
lesson
the
three
them
dropped
their
trowels
once
and
hurried
through
the
grounds
the
edge
the
forest
Hagrid
greeted
them
looking
flushed
and
excited
nearly
out
ushered
them
inside
The
egg
was
lying
the
table
There
were
deep
cracks
Something
was
moving
inside
funny
clicking
noise
was
coming
from
They
all
drew
their
chairs
the
table
and
watched
with
bated
breath
All
once
there
was
scraping
noise
and
the
egg
split
open
The
baby
dragon
flopped
onto
the
table
wasn
exactly
pretty
Harry
thought
looked
like
crumpled
black
umbrella
Its
spiny
wings
were
huge
compared
its
skinny
jet
body
had
long
snout
with
wide
nostrils
the
stubs
horns
and
bulging
orange
eyes
sneezed
couple
sparks
flew
out
its
snout
Isn
beautiful
Hagrid
murmured
reached
out
hand
stroke
the
dragon
head
snapped
his
fingers
showing
pointed
fangs
Bless
him
look
knows
his
mommy
said
Hagrid
Hagrid
said
Hermione
how
fast
Norwegian
Ridgebacks
grow
exactly
Hagrid
was
about
answer
when
the
color
suddenly
drained
from
his
face
leapt
his
feet
and
ran
the
window
What
the
matter
Someone
was
lookin
through
the
gap
the
curtains
kid
runnin
back
ter
the
school
Harry
bolted
the
door
and
looked
out
Even
distance
there
was
mistaking
him
Malfoy
had
seen
the
dragon
Something
about
the
smile
lurking
Malfoy
face
during
the
next
week
made
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
very
nervous
They
spent
most
their
free
time
Hagrid
darkened
hut
trying
reason
with
him
Just
let
him
Harry
urged
Set
him
free
can
said
Hagrid
too
little
die
They
looked
the
dragon
had
grown
three
times
length
just
week
Smoke
kept
furling
out
its
nostrils
Hagrid
hadn
been
doing
his
gamekeeping
duties
because
the
dragon
was
keeping
him
busy
There
were
empty
brandy
bottles
and
chicken
feathers
all
over
the
floor
decided
call
him
Norbert
said
Hagrid
looking
the
dragon
with
misty
eyes
really
knows
now
watch
Norbert
Norbert
Where
Mommy
lost
his
marbles
Ron
muttered
Harry
ear
Hagrid
said
Harry
loudly

weeks

Norbert

long

house
Malfoy

Dumbledore

moment
Hagrid
bit
his
lip
know

keep
him
forever
but

jus
dump
him

Harry
suddenly
turned
Ron
Charlie
said

Ron
Ron

brother
Charlie
Romania
Studying
dragons

send
Norbert

Charlie

take
care
him
and
then
put
him

the
wild
Brilliant
said
Ron
How
about
Hagrid
And
the
end
Hagrid
agreed
that
they
could
send
owl
Charlie
ask
him
The
following
week
dragged
Wednesday
night
found
Hermione
and
Harry
sitting
alone
the
common
room
long
after
everyone
else
had
gone

The
clock
the
wall
had
just
chimed
midnight
when
the
portrait
hole
burst
open
Ron
appeared
out
nowhere
pulled
off
Harry
invisibility
cloak

been
down
Hagrid
hut
helping
him

fluffy
little
bunny
rabbit
When
bit

off
for
frightening
And
when

singing
lullaby
There
was
tap
the
dark
window
Hedwig
said
Harry
hurrying
let
her
She
have
Charlie

The
three
them
put
their
heads
together

the
note

They
looked
one
another
got
the
invisibility
cloak
said
Harry
shouldn
too
difficult
think
the
cloaks
big
enough
cover
two
and
Norbert
was
mark
how
bad
the
last
week
had
been
that
the
other
two
agreed
with
him
Anything

rid
Norbert
and
Malfoy
There
was
hitch
the
next
morning
Ron
bitten
hand
had
swollen
twice
its
usual
size
didn
know
whether
was
safe
Madam
Pomfrey
would
she
recognize
dragon
bite
the
afternoon
though
had
choice
The
cut
had
turned
nasty
shade
green
looked
Norbert
fangs
were
poisonous
Harry
and
Hermione
rushed
the
hospital
wing
the
end
the
day
find
Ron
terrible
state

not
just
hand
whispered
although
that
feels
like
about

Malfoy
told
Madam
Pomfrey
wanted

one
books
could
come
and
have
good
laugh
kept
threatening
tell
her
what
really
bit
told
her
was
dog
but
don
think
she
believes
shouldn
have
hit
him
the
Quidditch
match
that
why
doing
this
Harry
and
Hermione
tried
calm
Ron
down
all
over
midnight
Saturday
said
Hermione
but
this
didn
soothe
Ron
all
the
contrary
sat
bolt
upright
and
broke
into
sweat
Midnight
Saturday
said
hoarse
voice
just
remembered
Charlie
letter
was
that
book
Malfoy
took
going
know
getting
rid
Norbert
Harry
and
Hermione
didn
get
chance
answer
Madam
Pomfrey
came
over
that
moment
and
made
them
leave
saying
Ron
needed
sleep
too
late
change
the
plan
now
Harry
told
Hermione
haven
got
time
send
Charlie
another
owl
and
this
could
our
only
chance
get
rid
Norbert
have
risk
And
have
got
the
invisibility
cloak
Malfoy
doesn
know
about
that
They
found
Fang
the
boarhound
sitting
outside
with
bandaged
tail
when
they
went
tell
Hagrid
who
opened
window
talk
them
won
let
you
puffed
Norbert
tricky
stage
nothin
can
handle
When
they
told
him
about
Charlie
letter
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
although
that
might
have
been
because
Norbert
had
just
bitten
him
the
leg
Aargh
all
right
only
got
boot
jus
playin
only
baby
after
all
The
baby
banged
its
tail
the
wall
making
the
windows
rattle
Harry
and
Hermione
walked
back
the
castle
feeling
Saturday
couldn
come
quickly
enough
They
would
have
felt
sorry
for
Hagrid
when
the
time
came
for
him
say
good
bye
Norbert
they
hadn
been
worried
about
what
they
had
was
very
dark
cloudy
night
and
they
were
bit
late
arriving
Hagrid
hut
because
they
had
wait
for
Peeves
get
out
their
way
the
entrance
hall
where
been
playing
tennis
against
the
wall
Hagrid
had
Norbert
packed
and
ready
large
crate
got
lots
rats
some
brandy
fer
the
journey
said
Hagrid
muffled
voice
packed
his
teddy
bear
case
gets
lonely
From
inside
the
crate
came
ripping
noises
that
sounded
Harry
though
the
teddy
was
having
his
head
torn
off
Bye
bye
Norbert
Hagrid
sobbed
Harry
and
Hermione
covered
the
crate
with
the
invisibility
cloak
and
stepped
underneath
themselves
Mommy
will
never
forget
you
How
they
managed
get
the
crate
back
the
castle
they
never
knew
Midnight
ticked
nearer
they
heaved
Norbert
the
marble
staircase
the
entrance
hall
and
along
the
dark
corridors
another
staircase
then
another
even
one
Harry
shortcuts
didn
make
the
work
much
easier
Nearly
there
Harry
panted
they
reached
the
corridor
beneath
the
tallest
tower
Then
sudden
movement
ahead
them
made
them
almost
drop
the
crate
Forgetting
that
they
were
already
invisible
they
shrank
into
the
shadows
staring
the
dark
outlines
two
people
grappling
with
each
other
ten
feet
away
lamp
flared
Professor
McGonagall
tartan
bathrobe
and
hair
net
had
Malfoy
the
ear
Detention
she
shouted
And
twenty
points
from
Slytherin
Wandering
around
the
middle
the
night
how
dare
you
You
don
understand
Professor
Harry
Potter
coming
got
dragon
What
utter
rubbish
How
dare
you
tell
such
lies
Come
shall
see
Professor
Snape
about
you
Malfoy
The
steep
spiral
staircase
the
top
the
tower
seemed
the
easiest
thing
the
world
after
that
Not
until
they
stepped
out
into
the
cold
night
air
did
they
throw
off
the
cloak
glad
able
breathe
properly
again
Hermione
did
sort
jig
Malfoy
got
detention
could
sing
Don
Harry
advised
her
Chuckling
about
Malfoy
they
waited
Norbert
thrashing
about
his
crate
About
ten
minutes
later
four
broomsticks
came
swooping
down
out
the
darkness
Charlie
friends
were
cheery
lot
They
showed
Harry
and
Hermione
the
harness
they
rigged
they
could
suspend
Norbert
between
them
They
all
helped
buckle
Norbert
safely
into
and
then
Harry
and
Hermione
shook
hands
with
the
others
and
thanked
them
very
much
last
Norbert
was
going
going
gone
They
slipped
back
down
the
spiral
staircase
their
hearts
light
their
hands
now
that
Norbert
was
off
them
more
dragon
Malfoy
detention
what
could
spoil
their
happiness
The
answer
that
was
waiting
the
foot
the
stairs
they
stepped
into
the
corridor
Filch
face
loomed
suddenly
out
the
darkness
Well
well
well
whispered
are
trouble
They
left
the
invisibility
cloak
top
the
tower
CHAPTER
FIFTEEN
THE
FORIBIDDEN
FOREST
Things
couldn
have
been
worse
Filch
took
them
down
Professor
McGonagall
study
the
first
floor
where
they
sat
and
waited
without
saying
word
each
other
Hermione
was
trembling
Excuses
alibis
and
wild
cover
stories
chased
each
other
around
Harry
brain
each
more
feeble
than
the
last
couldn
see
how
they
were
going
get
out
trouble
this
time
They
were
cornered
How
could
they
have
been
stupid
forget
the
cloak
There
was
reason
earth
that
Professor
McGonagall
would
accept
for
their
being
out
bed
and
creeping
around
the
school
the
dead
night
let
alone
being
the
tallest
astronomy
tower
which
was
out
bounds
except
for
classes
Add
Norbert
and
the
invisibility
cloak
and
they
might
well
packing
their
bags
already
Had
Harry
thought
that
things
couldn
have
been
worse
was
wrong
When
Professor
McGonagall
appeared
she
was
leading
Neville
Harry
Neville
burst
Out
the
moment
saw
the
other
two
was
trying
find
you
warn
you
heard
Malfoy
saying
was
going
catch
you
said
you
had
drag
Harry
shook
his
head
violently
shut
Neville
but
Professor
McGonagall
had
seen
She
looked
more
likely
breathe
fire
than
Norbert
she
towered
over
the
three
them
would
never
have
believed
any
you
Filch
says
you
were
the
astronomy
tower
one
clock
the
morning
Explain
yourselves
was
the
first
time
Hermione
had
ever
failed
answer
teacher
question
She
was
staring
her
slippers
still
statue
think
got
good
idea
what
been
going
said
Professor
McGonagall
doesn
take
genius
work
out
You
fed
Draco
Malfoy
some
cock
and
bull
story
about
dragon
trying
get
him
out
bed
and
into
trouble
already
caught
him
suppose
you
think
funny
that
Longbottom
here
heard
the
story
and
believed
too
Harry
caught
Neville
eye
and
tried
tell
him
without
words
that
this
wasn
true
because
Neville
was
looking
stunned
and
hurt
Poor
blundering
Neville
Harry
knew
what
must
have
cost
him
try
and
find
them
the
dark
warn
them
disgusted
said
Professor
McGonagall
Four
students
out
bed
one
night
never
heard
such
thing
before
You
Miss
Granger
thought
you
had
more
sense
for
you
Potter
thought
Gryffindor
meant
more
you
than
this
All
three
you
will
receive
detentions
yes
you
too
Longbottom
nothing
gives
you
the
right
walk
around
school
night
especially
these
days
very
dangerous
and
fifty
points
will
taken
from
Gryffindor
Fifty
Harry
gasped
they
would
lose
the
lead
the
lead
won
the
last
Quidditch
match
Fifty
points
each
said
Professor
McGonagall
breathing
heavily
through
her
long
pointed
nose
Professor
please
You
can
Don
tell
what
can
and
can
Potter
Now
get
back
bed
all
you
never
been
more
ashamed
Gryffindor
students
hundred
and
fifty
points
lost
That
put
Gryffindor
last
place
one
night
they
ruined
any
chance
Gryffindor
had
had
for
the
house
cup
Harry
felt
though
the
bottom
had
dropped
out
his
stomach
How
could
they
ever
make
for
this
Harry
didn
sleep
all
night
could
hear
Neville
sobbing
into
his
pillow
for
what
seemed
like
hours
Harry
couldn
think
anything
say
comfort
him
knew
Neville
like
himself
was
dreading
the
dawn
What
would
happen
when
the
rest
Gryffindor
found
out
what
they
done
first
Gryffindors
passing
the
giant
hourglasses
that
recorded
the
house
points
the
next
day
thought
there
been
mistake
How
could
they
suddenly
have
hundred
and
fifty
points
fewer
than
yesterday
And
then
the
story
started
spread
Harry
Potter
the
famous
Harry
Potter
their
hero
two
Quidditch
matches
had
them
all
those
points
him
and
couple
other
stupid
first
years
From
being
one
the
most
popular
and
admired
people
the
school
Harry
was
suddenly
the
most
hated
Even
Ravenclaws
and
Hufflepuffs
turned
him
because
everyone
had
been
longing
see
Slytherin
lose
the
house
cup
Everywhere
Harry
went
people
pointed
and
didn
trouble
lower
their
voices
they
insulted
him
Slytherins
the
other
hand
clapped
walked
past
them
whistling
and
cheering
Thanks
Potter
owe
you
one
Only
Ron
stood
him
They
all
forget
this
few
weeks
Fred
and
George
have
lost
loads
points
all
the
time
they
been
here
and
people
still
like
them
They
never
lost
hundred
and
fifty
points
one
though
have
they
said
Harry
miserably
Well
Ron
admitted
was
bit
late
repair
the
damage
but
Harry
swore
himself
not
meddle
things
that
weren
his
business
from
now
had
with
sneaking
around
and
spying
felt
ashamed
himself
that
went
Wood
and
offered
resign
from
the
Quidditch
team
Resign
Wood
thundered
What
good
that
How
are
going
get
any
points
back
can
win
Quidditch
But
even
Quidditch
had
lost
its
fun
The
rest
the
team
wouldn
speak
Harry
during
practice
and
they
had
speak
about
him
they
called
him
the
Seeker
Hermione
and
Neville
were
suffering
too
They
didn
have
bad
time
Harry
because
they
weren
well
known
but
nobody
would
speak
them
either
Hermione
had
stopped
drawing
attention
herself
class
keeping
her
head
down
and
working
silence
Harry
was
almost
glad
that
the
exams
weren
far
away
All
the
studying
had
kept
his
mind
off
his
misery
Ron
and
Hermione
kept
themselves
working
late
into
the
night
trying
remember
the
ingredients
complicated
potions
learn
charms
and
spells
heart
memorize
the
dates
magical
discoveries
and
goblin
rebellions
Then
about
week
before
the
exams
were
due
start
Harry
new
resolution
not
interfere
anything
that
didn
concern
him
was
put
unexpected
test
Walking
back
from
the
library
his
own
one
afternoon
heard
somebody
whimpering
from
classroom
ahead
drew
closer
heard
Quirrell
voice
not
again
please
sounded
though
someone
was
threatening
him
Harry
moved
closer
All
right
all
right
heard
Quirrell
sob
Next
second
Quirrell
came
hurrying
out
the
classroom
straightening
his
turban
was
pale
and
looked
though
was
about
cry
strode
out
sight
Harry
didn
think
Quirrell
had
even
noticed
him
waited
until
Quirrell
footsteps
had
disappeared
then
peered
into
the
classroom
was
empty
but
door
stood
ajar
the
other
end
Harry
was
halfway
toward
before
remembered
what
promised
himself
about
not
meddling
All
the
same
have
gambled
twelve
Sorcerer
Stones
that
Snape
had
just
left
the
room
and
from
what
Harry
had
just
heard
Snape
would
walking
with
new
spring
his
step
Quirrell
seemed
have
given
last
Harry
went
back
the
library
where
Hermione
was
testing
Ron
Astronomy
Harry
told
them
what
heard
Snape
done
then
said
Ron
Quirrell
told
him
how
break
his
Anti
Dark
Force
spell
There
still
Fluffy
though
said
Hermione
Maybe
Snape
found
out
how
get
past
him
without
asking
Hagrid
said
Ron
looking
the
thousands
books
surrounding
them
bet
there
book
somewhere
here
telling
you
how
get
past
giant
three
headed
dog
what
Harry
The
light
adventure
was
kindling
again
Ron
eyes
but
Hermione
answered
before
Harry
could
Dumbledore
That
what
should
have
done
ages
ago
try
anything
ourselves
thrown
out
for
sure
But
got
proof
said
Harry
Quirrell
too
scared
back
Snape
only
got
say
doesn
know
how
the
troll
got
Halloween
and
that
was
nowhere
near
the
third
floor
who
you
think
they
believe
him
not
exactly
secret
hate
him
Dumbledore
think
made
get
him
sacked
Filch
wouldn
help
his
life
depended
too
friendly
with
Snape
and
the
more
students
get
thrown
out
the
better
think
And
don
forget
not
supposed
know
about
the
Stone
Fluffy
That
take
lot
explaining
Hermione
looked
convinced
but
Ron
didn
just
bit
poking
around
said
Harry
flatly
done
enough
poking
around
pulled
map
Jupiter
toward
him
and
started
learn
the
names
its
moons
The
following
morning
notes
were
delivered
Harry
Hermione

The
forest
was
black
and
silent
little
way
into
they
reached
fork
the
earth
path
and
Harry
Hermione
and
Hagrid
took
the
left
path
while
Malfoy
Neville
and
Fang
took
the
right
They
walked
silence
their
eyes
the
ground
Every
now
and
then
ray
moonlight
through
the
branches
above

spot
silver
blue

the

Harry

said
Hagrid
not

ter

They
walked
past
mossy
tree
stump
Harry
could
hear
running
water
there
must
stream
somewhere
close
There
were
still
spots
unicorn
blood
here
and
there
along
the
winding
path
You

Hermione
Hagrid
whispered
Don

and
Hermione
and

off
the
path
behind
towering
oak
pulled
out
arrow
and
fitted
into
his
crossbow
raising
ready
fire
The
three
them
listened
Something
was
slithering
over
dead
leaves
nearby
sounded
like
cloak
trailing
along
the
ground
Hagrid
was
squinting
the
dark
path
but
after
few
seconds
the
sound
faded
away
knew
murmured

Hagrid
grimly
Right

sound
Suddenly

Harry
and
Hermione
followed
him
out
the
clearing
staring
over

shoulders
Ronan
and
Bane
until
the
trees
blocked
their
view
Never

They
walked
through
the
dense
dark
trees
Harry
kept
looking
nervously
over
his
shoulder
had
the
nasty
feeling
they
were
being
watched
was
very
glad
they
had
Hagrid
and
his
crossbow
with
them
They
had
just
passed
bend
the
path
when
Hermione
grabbed
Hagrid
arm
Hagrid
Look

You

Hagrid
shouted
Stay

path

They
heard
him
crashing
away
through
the
undergrowth
and
stood
looking
each
other
very
scared
until
they
couldn
hear
anything
but
the
rustling
leaves
around
them
You
don
think
they
been
hurt
you
whispered
Hermione
don

Malfoy

but
something

Neville
our
fault
here
the
first
place
The
minutes
dragged
Their
ears
seemed
sharper
than
usual
Harry
seemed
picking
every
sigh
the
wind
every
cracking
twig
What
was
going
Where
were
the
others
last
great
crunching
noise
announced
Hagrid

Malfoy
Neville
and
Fang
were
with
him
Hagrid
was
fuming
Malfoy
seemed
had
sneaked
behind
Neville
and
grabbed
him

Neville
had
panicked
and
sent
the
sparks
lucky
ter

Hagrid
added
whisper
Harry
but

harder
time
frightenin
you
gotta
get
this
done
Harry
set
off
into
the
heart
the
forest
with
Malfoy
and
Fang
They
walked
for
nearly
half
hour
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
forest
until
the
path
became
almost
impossible
follow
because
the
trees
were
thick
Harry
thought
the
blood
seemed
getting
thicker
There
were
splashes
the
roots
tree
though
the
poor
creature
had
been
thrashing
around
pain
close
Harry
could
see
clearing
ahead
through
the
tangled
branches
ancient
oak
Look
murmured
holding
out
his
arm
stop
Malfoy
Something
bright
white
was
gleaming
the
ground
They
inched
closer
was
the
unicorn
all
right
and
was
dead
Harry
had
never
seen
anything
beautiful
and
sad
Its
long
slender
legs
were
stuck
out
odd
angles
where
had
fallen
and
its
mane
was
spread
pearly
white
the
dark
leaves
Harry
had
taken
one
step
toward
when
slithering
sound
made
him
freeze
where
stood
bush
the
edge
the
clearing
quivered
Then
out
the
shadows
hooded
figure
came
crawling
across
the
ground
like
some
stalking
beast
Harry
Malfoy
and
Fang
stood
transfixed
The
cloaked
figure
reached
the
unicorn
lowered
its
head
over
the
wound
the
animal
side
and
began
drink
its
blood
AAAAAAAAAARGH
Malfoy
let
out
terrible
scream
and
bolted
did
Fang
The
hooded
figure
raised
its
head
and
looked
right
Harry
unicorn
blood
was
dribbling
down
its
front
got
its
feet
and
came
swiftly
toward
Harry
couldn
move
for
fear
Then
pain
like
never
felt
before
pierced
his
head
was
though
his
scar
were
fire
Half
blinded
staggered
backward
heard
hooves
behind
him
galloping
and
something
jumped
clean
over
Harry
charging
the
figure
The
pain
Harry
head
was
bad
fell
his
knees
took
minute
two
pass
When
looked
the
figure
had
gone
centaur
was
standing
over
him
not
Ronan
Bane
this
one
looked
younger
had
white
blond
hair
and
palomino
body
Are
you
all
right
said
the
centaur
pulling
Harry
his
feet
Yes
thank
you
what
was
that
The
centaur
didn
answer
had
astonishingly
blue
eyes
like
pale
sapphires
looked
carefully
Harry
his
eyes
lingering
the
scar
that
stood
out
livid
Harry
forehead
You
are
the
Potter
boy
said
You
had
better
get
back
Hagrid
The
forest
not
safe
this
time
especially
for
you
Can
you
ride
will
quicker
this
way
name
Firenze
added
lowered
himself
his
front
legs
that
Harry
could
clamber
onto
his
back
There
was
suddenly
sound
more
galloping
from
the
other
side
the
clearing
Ronan
and
Bane
came
bursting
through
the
trees
their
flanks
heaving
and
sweaty
Firenze
Bane
thundered
What
are
you
doing
You
have
human
your
back
Have
you
shame
Are
you
common
mule
you
realize
who
this
said
Firenze
This
the
Potter
boy
The
quicker
leaves
this
forest
the
better
What
have
you
been
telling
him
growled
Bane
Remember
Firenze
are
sworn
not
set
ourselves
against
the
heavens
Have
not
read
what
come
the
movements
the
planets
Ronan
pawed
the
ground
nervously
sure
Firenze
thought
was
acting
for
the
best
said
his
gloomy
voice
Bane
kicked
his
back
legs
anger
For
the
best
What
that
with
Centaurs
are
concerned
with
what
has
been
foretold
not
our
business
run
around
like
donkeys
after
stray
humans
our
forest
Firenze
suddenly
reared
his
hind
legs
anger
that
Harry
had
grab
his
shoulders
stay
you
not
see
that
unicorn
Firenze
bellowed
Bane
you
not
understand
why
was
killed
have
the
planets
not
let
you
that
secret
set
myself
against
what
lurking
this
forest
Bane
yes
with
humans
alongside
must
And
Firenze
whisked
around
with
Harry
clutching
best
could
they
plunged
off
into
the
trees
leaving
Ronan
and
Bane
behind
them
Harry
didn
have
clue
what
was
going
Why
Bane
angry
asked
What
was
that
thing
you
saved
from
anyway
Firenze
slowed
walk
warned
Harry
keep
his
head
bowed
case
low
hanging
branches
but
did
not
answer
Harry
question
They
made
their
way
through
the
trees
silence
for
long
that
Harry
thought
Firenze
didn
want
talk
him
anymore
They
were
passing
through
particularly
dense
patch
trees
however
when
Firenze
suddenly
stopped
Harry
Potter
you
know
what
unicorn
blood
used
for
said
Harry
startled
the
odd
question
only
used
the
horn
and
tail
hair
Potions
That
because
monstrous
thing
slay
unicorn
said
Firenze
Only
one
who
has
nothing
lose
and
everything
gain
would
commit
such
crime
The
blood
unicorn
will
keep
you
alive
even
you
are
inch
from
death
but
terrible
price
You
have
slain
something
pure
and
defenseless
save
yourself
and
you
will
have
but
half
life
cursed
life
from
the
moment
the
blood
touches
your
lips
Harry
stared
the
back
Firenze
head
which
was
dappled
silver
the
moonlight
But
who
that
desperate
wondered
aloud
you
going
cursed
forever
deaths
better
isn
Firenze
agreed
unless
all
you
need
stay
alive
long
enough
drink
something
else
something
that
will
bring
you
back
full
strength
and
power
something
that
will
mean
you
can
never
die
Potter
you
know
what
hidden
the
school
this
very
moment
The
Sorcerer
Stone
course
the
Elixir
Life
But
don
understand
who
Can
you
think
nobody
who
has
waited
many
years
return
power
who
has
clung
life
awaiting
their
chance
was
though
iron
fist
had
clenched
suddenly
around
Harry
heart
Over
the
rustling
the
trees
seemed
hear
once
more
what
Hagrid
had
told
him
the
night
they
had
met
Some
say
died
Codswallop
opinion
Dunno
had
enough
human
left
him
die
you
mean
Harry
croaked
that
was
Vol
Harry
Harry
are
you
all
right
Hermione
was
running
toward
them
down
the
path
Hagrid
puffing
along
behind
her
fine
said
Harry
hardly
knowing
what
was
saying
The
unicorn
dead
Hagrid
that
clearing
back
there
This
where

Firenze
murmured
Hagrid
hurried
off
examine
the
unicorn
You
are
safe
now
Harry
slid
off
his
back
Good
luck
Harry
Potter
said
Firenze
The
planets
have
been
read
wrongly
before
now
even
centaurs
hope
this
one
those
times
turned
and
cantered
back
into
the
depths
the
forest
leaving
Harry
shivering
behind
him
Ron
had
fallen
asleep
the
dark
common
room
waiting
for
them
return
shouted
something
about
Quidditch
fouls
when
Harry
roughly
shook
him
awake
matter
seconds
though
was
wide
eyed
Harry
began
tell
him
and
Hermione
what
had
happened
the
forest
Harry
couldn
sit
down
paced
and
down
front
the
fire
was
still
shaking
Snape

the
stone
for
Voldemort
and
Voldemort
waiting
the
forest
and
all
this
time
thought
Snape
just
wanted
get
rich
Stop
saying
the
name
said
Ron
terrified
whisper
thought
Voldemort
could
hear
them
Harry
wasn
listening
Firenze
saved
but
shouldn
have
done
Bane
was
furious
was
talking
about
interfering
with
what
the
planets
say
going
happen
They
must
show
that
Voldemort
coming
back
Bane
thinks
Firenze
should
have
let
Voldemort
kill
suppose
that
written
the
stars
well
Will

stop
saying
the
name
Ron
hissed
all
got
wait
for
now
Snape

the
Stone
Harry
went
feverishly
then
Voldemort
will
able
come
and
finish
off
Well
suppose
Bane
happy
Hermione
looked
very
frightened
but
she
had
word
comfort
Harry
everyone
says
Dumbledore
the
only
one
You
Know
Who
was
ever
afraid
With
Dumbledore
around
You
Know
Who
won
touch
you
Anyway
who
says
the
centaurs
are
right
sounds
like
fortune
telling
and
Professor
McGonagall
says
that
very
imprecise
branch
magic
The
sky
had
turned
light
before
they
stopped
talking
They
went
bed
exhausted
their
throats
sore
But
the
night
surprises
weren
over
When
Harry
pulled
back
his
sheets
found
his
invisibility
cloak
folded
neatly
underneath
them
There
was
note
pinned
Just
case
CHAPTER
SIXTEEN
THROUGH
THE
TRAPDOOR
years
come
Harry
would
never
quite
remember
how
had
managed
get
through
his
exams
when
half
expected
Voldemort
come
bursting
through
the
door
any
moment
Yet
the
days
crept
and
there
could
doubt
that
Fluffy
was
still
alive
and
well
behind
the
locked
door
was
sweltering
hot
especially
the
large
classroom
where
they
did
their
written
papers
They
had
been
given
special
new
quills
for
the
exams
which
had
been
bewitched
with
AntiCheating
spell
They
had
practical
exams
well
Professor
Flitwick
called
them
one
one
into
his
class
see
they
could
make
pineapple
tapdance
across
desk
Professor
McGonagall
watched
them
turn
mouse
into
snuffbox
points
were
given
for
how
pretty
the
snuffbox
was
but
taken
away
had
whiskers
Snape
made
them
all
nervous
breathing
down
their
necks
while
they
tried
remember
how
make
Forgetfulness
potion
Harry
did
the
best
could
trying
ignore
the
stabbing
pains
his
forehead
which
had
been
bothering
him
ever
since
his
trip
into
the
forest
Neville
thought
Harry
had
bad
case
exam
nerves
because
Harry
couldn
sleep
but
the
truth
was
that
Harry
kept
being
woken
his
old
nightmare
except
that
was
now
worse
than
ever
because
there
was
hooded
figure
dripping
blood
Maybe
was
because
they
hadn
seen
what
Harry
had
seen
the
forest
because
they
didn
have
scars
burning
their
foreheads
but
Ron
and
Hermione
didn
seem
worried
about
the
Stone
Harry
The
idea
Voldemort
certainly
scared
them
but
didn
keep
visiting
them
dreams
and
they
were
busy
with
their
studying
they
didn
have
much
time
fret
about
what
Snape
anyone
else
might
Their
very
last
exam
was
History
Magic
One
hour
answering
questions
about
batty
old
wizards
who
invented
selfstirring
cauldrons
and
they
free
free
for
whole
wonderful
week
until
their
exam
results
came
out
When
the
ghost
Professor
Binns
told
them
put
down
their
quills
and
roll
their
parchment
Harry
couldn
help
cheering
with
the
rest
That
was
far
easier
than
thought
would
said
Hermione
they
joined
the
crowds
flocking
out
onto
the
sunny
grounds
needn
have
learned
about
the
1637
Werewolf
Code
Conduct
the
uprising
Elfric
the
Eager
Hermione
always
liked
through
their
exam
papers
afterward
but
Ron
said
this
made
him
feel
ill
they
wandered
down
the
lake
and
flopped
under
tree
The
Weasley
twins
and
Lee
Jordan
were
tickling
the
tentacles
giant
squid
which
was
basking
the
warm
shallows
more
studying
Ron
sighed
happily
stretching
out
the
grass
You
could
look
more
cheerful
Harry
got
week
before
find
out
how
badly
done
there
need
worry
yet
Harry
was
rubbing
his
forehead
wish
knew
what
this
means
burst
out
angrily
scar
keeps
hurting
happened
before
but
never
often
this
Madam
Pomfrey
Hermione
suggested
not
ill
said
Harry
think
warning
means
danger
coming
Ron
couldn
get
worked
was
too
hot
Harry
relax
Hermione
right
the
Stone
safe
long
Dumbledore
around
Anyway
never
had
any
proof
Snape
found
out
how
get
past
Fluffy
nearly
had
his
leg
ripped
off
once
not
going
try
again
hurry
And
Neville
will
play
Quidditch
for
England
before
Hagrid
lets
Dumbledore
down
Harry
nodded
but
couldn
shake
off
lurking
feeling
that
there
was
something
forgotten
something
important
When
tried
explain
this
Hermione
said
That
just
the
exams
woke
last
night
and
was
halfway
through
Transfiguration
notes
before
remembered
done
that
one
Harry
was
quite
sure
the
unsettled
feeling
didn
have
anything
with
work
though
watched
owl
flutter
toward
the
school
across
the
bright
blue
sky
note
clamped
its
mouth
Hagrid
was
the
only
one
who
ever
sent
him
letters
Hagrid
would
never
betray
Dumbledore
Hagrid
would
never
tell
anyone
how
get
past
Fluffy
never
but
Harry
suddenly
jumped
his
feet
Where

said
Ron
sleepily
just
thought
something
said
Harry
had
turned
white
got
and
see
Hagrid
now
Why

Hermione
hurrying

Don

Harry

grassy
slope

Hagrid
wants
more
than

pocket
How

Lucky

Hagrid

Why

Ron
but
Harry
sprinting
across
the
grounds
toward
the
forest
didn
answer
Hagrid
was
sitting
armchair
outside
his
house
his
trousers
and
sleeves

rolled
and
was
shelling
peas
into
large
bowl
Hullo

Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
didn

all
until

the
entrance

which
seemed
very
cold
and
gloomy
after
the
grounds

Dumbledore
said
Harry
Hagrid

that
stranger

Fluffy
and

Hagrid
drunk
just

Dumbledore
believes
Firenze
might

Bane
doesn
stop
him
Where
Dumbledore
office
They
looked
around
hoping
see
sign
pointing
them
the
right
direction
They
had
never
been
told
where
Dumbledore
lived
nor
did
they
know
anyone
who
had
been
sent
see
him
just
have
Harry
began
but
voice
suddenly
rang
across
the
hall
What
are
you
three
doing
inside
was
Professor
McGonagall
carrying
large
pile
books
want
see
Professor
Dumbledore
said
Hermione
rather
bravely
Harry
and
Ron
thought
See
Professor
Dumbledore
Professor
McGonagall
repeated
though
this
was
very
fishy
thing
want
Why
Harry
swallowed
now
what
sort
secret
said
but
wished
once
hadn
because
Professor
McGonagall
nostrils
flared
Professor
Dumbledore
left
ten
minutes
ago
she
said
coldly
received
urgent
owl
from
the
Ministry
Magic
and
flew
off
for
London
once
gone
said
Harry
frantically
Now
Professor
Dumbledore
very
great
wizard
Potter
has
many
demands
his
time
But
this
important
Something
you
have
say
more
important
than
the
Ministry
Magic
Potter
Look
said
Harry
throwing
caution
the
winds
Professor
about
the
Sorcerer
tone
Whatever
Professor
McGonagall
had
expected
wasn
that
The
books
she
was
carrying
tumbled
out
her
arms
but
she
didn
pick
them
How
you
know
she
spluttered
Professor
think
know
that
that
someone
going
try
and
steal
the
Stone
got
talk
Professor
Dumbledore
She
eyed
him
with
mixture
shock
and
suspicion
Professor
Dumbledore
will
back
tomorrow
she
said
finally
don
know
how
you
found
out
about
the
Stone
but
rest
assured
one
can
possibly
steal
too
well
protected
But
Professor
Potter
know
what
talking
about
she
said
shortly
She
bent
down
and
gathered
the
fallen
books
suggest
you
all
back
outside
and
enjoy
the
sunshine
But
they
didn
tonight
said
Harry
once
was
sure
Professor
McGonagall
was
out
earshot
Snape
going
through
the
trapdoor
tonight
found
out
everything
needs
and
now
got
Dumbledore
out
the
way
sent
that
note
bet
the
Ministry
Magic
will
get
real
shock
when
Dumbledore
turns
But
what
can
Hermione
gasped
Harry
and
Ron
wheeled
round
Snape
was
standing
there
Good
afternoon
said
smoothly
They
stared
him
You
shouldn
inside
day
like
this
said
with
odd
twisted
smile
were
Harry
began
without
any
idea
what
was
going
say
You
want
more
careful
said
Snape
Hanging
around
like
this
people
will
think
you
something
And
Gryffindor
really
can
afford
lose
any
more
points
can
Harry
flushed
They
turned
outside
but
Snape
called
them
back
warned
Potter
any
more
nighttime
wanderings
and
will
personally
make
sure
you
are
expelled
Good
day
you
strode
off
the
direction
the
staffroom
Out
the
stone
steps
Harry
turned
the
others
Right
here

got
whispered
urgently
One

staff
room

Ron

said
Hermione
but
she
agreed
and
watch
out
for
Snape
And
better

outside
the
third
floor
corridor
Harry
told
Ron
Come
But
that
part
the
plan
didn
work
sooner
had
they
reached
the
door
separating
Fluffy
from
the
rest
the
school
than
Professor
McGonagall
turned
again
and
this
time
she
lost
her
temper
suppose
you
think
you
harder
get
past
than
pack
enchantments
she
stormed
Enough

nonsense

fifty
points
from
Gryffindor
Yes
Weasley

the
portrait
the
Fat
Lady

Ron
All

Hermione
briskly
How

Hermione
grimly
Flitwick
told
secret
that

hundred
and
twelve
percent

exam
They
not
throwing
out
after
that
After
dinner
the
three
them
sat
nervously
apart
the
common
room
Nobody
bothered
them
none
the
Gryffindors
had
anything
say
Harry
any
more
after
all
This
was
the
first
night
hadn
been
upset
Hermione
was
skimming
through
all
her
notes
hoping
come
across
one
the
enchantments
they
were
about
try
break
Harry
and
Ron
didn
talk
much
Both
them
were
thinking
about
what
they
were
about
Slowly
the
room
emptied
people
drifted
off
bed
Better
get
the
cloak
Ron
muttered
Lee
Jordan
finally
left
stretching
and
yawning
Harry
ran
upstairs
their
dark
dormitory
putted
out
the
cloak
and
then
his
eyes
fell
the
flute
Hagrid
had
given
him
for
Christmas
pocketed
use
Fluffy
didn
feel
much
like
singing
ran
back
down
the
common
room
better
put
the
cloak
here
and
make
sure
covers
all
three
Filch
spots
one
our
feet
wandering
along
its
own
What
are
you
doing
said
voice
from
the
corner
the
room
Neville
appeared
from
behind
armchair
clutching
Trevor
the
toad
who
looked
though
been
making
another
bid
for
freedom
Nothing
Neville
nothing
said
Harry
hurriedly
putting
the
cloak
behind
his
back
Neville
stared
their
guilty
faces
You
going
out
again
said
said
Hermione
not
Why
don
you
bed
Neville
Harry
looked
the
grandfather
clock
the
door
They
couldn
afford
waste
any
more
time
Snape
might
even
now
playing
Fluffy
sleep
You
can
out
said
Neville
you
caught
again
Gryffindor
will
even
more
trouble
You
don
understand
said
Harry
this
important
But
Neville
was
clearly
steeling
himself
something
desperate
won
let
you
said
hurrying
stand
front
the
portrait
hole
fight
you
Neville
Ron
exploded
get
away
from
that
hole
and
don
idiot
Don

said
Neville
don
think
you
should
breaking
any
more
rules
And
you
were
the
one
who
told
stand
people
Yes
but
not
said
Ron
exasperation
Neville
you
don
know
what
you
doing
took
step
forward
and
Neville
dropped
Trevor
the
toad
who
leapt
out
sight
then
try
and
hit
said
Neville
raising
his
fists
ready
Harry
turned
Hermione
something
said
desperately
Hermione
stepped
forward
Neville
she
said
really
really
sorry
about
this
She
raised
her
wand
Petrificus
Totalus
she
cried
pointing
Neville
Neville
arms
snapped
his
sides
His
legs
sprang
together
His
whole
body
rigid
swayed
where
stood
and
then
fell
flat
his
face
stiff
board
Hermione
ran
turn
him
over
Neville
jaws
were
jammed
together
couldn
speak
Only
his
eyes
were
moving
looking
them
horror
What
you
done
him
Harry
whispered
the
full
Body
Bind
said
Hermione
miserably
Neville
sorry
had
Neville
time
explain
said
Harry
You
understand
later
Neville
said
Ron
they
stepped
over
him
and
pulled
the
invisibility
cloak
But
leaving
Neville
lying
motionless
the
floor
didn
feel
like
very
good
omen
their
nervous
state
every
statue
shadow
looked
like
Filch
every
distant
breath
wind
sounded
like
Peeves
swooping
down
them
the
foot
the
first
set
stairs
they
spotted
Mrs
Norris
skulking
near
the
top
let
kick
her
just
this
once
Ron
whispered
Harry
ear
but
Harry
shook
his
head
they
climbed
carefully
around
her
Mrs
Norris
turned
her
lamplike
eyes
them
but
didn
anything
They
didn
meet
anyone
else
until
they
reached
the
staircase
the
third
floor
Peeves
was
bobbing
halfway
loosening
the
carpet
that
people
would
trip
Who
there
said
suddenly
they
climbed
toward
him
narrowed
his
wicked
black
eyes
Know
you
there
even
can
see
you
Are
you
ghoulie
ghostie
wee
student
beastie
rose
the
air
and
floated
there
squinting
them
Should
call
Filch
should
something
creeping
around
unseen
Harry
had
sudden
idea
Peeves
said
hoarse
whisper
the
Bloody
Baron
has
his
own
reasons
for
being
invisible
Peeves
almost
fell
out
the
air
shock
caught
himself
time
and
hovered
about
foot
off
the
stairs
sorry
your
bloodiness
Baron
Sir
said
greasily
mistake
mistake
didn
see
you
course
didn
you
invisible
forgive
old
Peevsie
his
little
joke

business
here
Peeves
croaked
Harry
Stay
away
from
this
place
tonight
will
sir
most
certainly
will
said
Peeves
rising
the
air
again
Hope
your
business
goes
well
Baron
not
bother
you
And
scooted
off
Brilliant
Harry
whispered
Ron
few
seconds
later
they
were
there
outside
the
third
floor
corridor
and
the
door
was
already
ajar
Well
there
you
are
Harry
said
quietly
Snape
already
got
past
Fluffy
Seeing
the
open
door
somehow
seemed
impress
upon
all
three
them
what
was
facing
them
Underneath
the
cloak
Harry
turned
the
other
two
you
want
back
won
blame
you
said
You
can
take
the
cloak
won
need
now
Don
stupid
said
Ron
coming
said
Hermione
Harry
pushed
the
door
open
the
door
creaked
low
rumbling
growls
met
their
ears
All
three
the
dog
noses
sniffed
madly
their
direction
even
though
couldn
see
them
What
that
its
feet
Hermione
whispered
Looks
like
harp
said
Ron
Snape
must
have
left
there
must
wake
the
moment
you
stop
playing
said
Harry
Well
here
goes
put
Hagrid
flute
his
lips
and
blew
wasn
really
tune
but
from
the
first
note
the
beast
eyes
began
droop
Harry
hardly
drew
breath
Slowly
the
dog
growls
ceased
tottered
its
paws
and
fell
its
knees
then
slumped
the
ground
fast
asleep
Keep
playing
Ron
warned
Harry
they
slipped
out
the
cloak
and
crept
toward
the
trapdoor
They
could
feel
the
dog
hot
smelly
breath
they
approached
the
giant
heads
think
able
pull
the
door
open
said
Ron
peering
over
the
dog
back
Want
first
Hermione
don
All
right
Ron
gritted
his
teeth
and
stepped
carefully
over
the
dog
legs
bent
and
pulled
the
ring
the
trapdoor
which
swung
and
open
What
can
you
see
Hermione
said
anxiously
Nothing
just
black
there
way
climbing
down
just
have
drop
Harry
who
was
still
playing
the
flute
waved
Ron
get
his
attention
and
pointed
himself
You
want
first
Are
you
sure
said
Ron
don
know
how
deep
this
thing
goes
Give
the
flute
Hermione
she
can
keep
him
asleep
Harry
handed
the
flute
over
the
few
seconds
silence
the
dog
growled
and
twitched
but
the
moment
Hermione
began
play
fell
back
into
its
deep
sleep
Harry
climbed
over
and
looked
down
through
the
trapdoor
There
was
sign
the
bottom
lowered
himself
through
the
hole
until
was
hanging
his
fingertips
Then
looked
Ron
and
said
anything
happens
don
follow
straight
the
owlery
and
send
Hedwig
Dumbledore
right
Right
said
Ron
See
you
minute
hope
And
Harry
let
Cold
damp
air
rushed
past
him
fell
down
down
down
and
FLUMP
With
funny
muffled
sort
thump
landed
something
soft
sat
and
felt
around
his
eyes
not
used
the
gloom
felt
though
was
sitting
some
sort
plant
okay
called
the
light
the
size
postage
stamp
which
was
the
open
trapdoor
soft
landing
you
can
jump
Ron
followed
right
away
landed
sprawled
next
Harry
What
this
stuff
were
his
first
words
Dunno
some
sort
plant
thing
suppose
here
break
the
fall
Come
Hermione
The
distant
music
stopped
There
was
loud
bark
from
the
dog
but
Hermione
had
already
jumped
She
landed
Harry
other
side
must
miles
under
the
school
she
said
Lucky
this
plant
thing
here
really
said
Ron
Lucky
shrieked
Hermione
Look
you
both
She
leapt
and
struggled
toward
damp
wall
She
had
struggle
because
the
moment
she
had
landed
the
plant
had
started
twist
snakelike
tendrils
around
her
ankles
for
Harry
and
Ron
their
legs
had
already
been
bound
tightly
long
creepers
without
their
noticing
Hermione
had
managed
free
herself
before
the
plant
got
firm
grip
her
Now
she
watched
horror
the
two
boys
fought
pull
the
plant
off
them
but
the
more
they
strained
against
the
tighter
and
faster
the
plant
wound
around
them
Stop
moving
Hermione
ordered
them
know
what
this
Devil
Snare
glad
know
what
called
that
great
help
snarled
Ron
leaning
back
trying
stop
the
plant
from
curling
around
his
neck
Shut
trying
remember
how
kill
said
Hermione
Well
hurry
can
breathe
Harry
gasped
wrestling
with
curled
around
his
chest
Devil
Snare
Devil
Snare
what
did
Professor
Sprout
say
likes
the
dark
and
the
damp
light
fire
Harry
choked
Yes
course
but
there
wood
Hermione
cried
wringing
her
hands
HAVE
YOU
GONE
MAD
Ron
bellowed
ARE
YOU
WITCH
NOT
right
said
Hermione
and
she
whipped
out
her
wand
waved
muttered
something
and
sent
jet
the
same
bluebell
flames
she
had
used
Snape
the
plant
matter
seconds
the
two
boys
felt
loosening
its
grip
cringed
away
from
the
light
and
warmth
Wriggling
and
flailing
unraveled
itself
from
their
bodies
and
they
were
able
pull
free
Lucky
you
pay
attention
Herbology
Hermione
said
Harry
joined
her
the
wall
wiping
sweat
off
his
face
Yeah
said
Ron
and
lucky
Harry
doesn
lose
his
head
crisis
there
wood
honestly
This
way
said
Harry
pointing
down
stone
passageway
which
was
the
only
way
forward
All
they
could
hear
apart
from
their
footsteps
was
the
gentle
drip
water
trickling
down
the
walls
The
passageway
sloped
downward
and
Harry
was
reminded
Gringotts
With
unpleasant
jolt
the
heart
remembered
the
dragons
said
guarding
vaults
the
wizards
bank
they
met
dragon
fully
grown
dragon
Norbert
had
been
bad
enough
Can
you
hear
something
Ron
whispered
Harry
listened
soft
rustling
and
clinking
seemed
coming
from
ahead
you
think
ghost
don
know
sounds
like
wings
There
light
ahead
can
see
something
moving
They
reached
the
end
the
passageway
and
saw
before
them
brilliantly
lit
chamber
its
ceiling
arching
high
above
them
was
full
small
jewel
bright
birds
fluttering
and
tumbling
all
around
the
room
the
opposite
side
the
chamber
was
heavy
wooden
door
you
think
they
attack
cross
the
room
said
Ron
Probably
said
Harry
They
don
look
very
vicious
but
suppose
they
all
swooped
down
once
well
there
other
choice
run
took
deep
breath
covered
his
face
with
his
arms
and
sprinted
across
the
room
expected
feel
sharp
beaks
and
claws
tearing
him
any
second
but
nothing
happened
reached
the
door
untouched
pulled
the
handle
but
was
locked
The
other
two
followed
him
They
tugged
and
heaved
the
door
but
wouldn
budge
not
even
when
Hermione
tried
her
Alohomora
charm
Now
what
said
Ron
These
birds
they
can
here
just
for
decoration
said
Hermione
They
watched
the
birds
soaring
overhead
glittering
glittering
They
not
birds
Harry
said
suddenly
They
keys
Winged
keys
look
carefully
that
must
mean
looked
around
the
chamber
while
the
other
two
squinted
the
flock
keys
yes
look
Broomsticks
got
catch
the
key
the
door
But
there
are
hundreds
them
Ron
examined
the
lock
the
door
looking
for
big
old
fashioned
one
probably
silver
like
the
handle
They
each
seized
broomstick
and
kicked
off
into
the
air
soaring
into
the
midst
the
cloud
keys
They
grabbed
and
snatched
but
the
bewitched
keys
darted
and
dived
quickly
was
almost
impossible
catch
one
Not
for
nothing
though
was
Harry
the
youngest
Seeker
century
had
knack
for
spotting
things
other
people
didn
After
minute
weaving
about
through
the
whirl
rainbow
feathers
noticed
large
silver
key
that
had
bent
wing
had
already
been
caught
and
stuffed
roughly
into
the
keyhole
That
one
called
the
others
That
big
one
there
there
with
bright
blue
wings
the
feathers
are
all
crumpled
one
side
Ron
went
speeding
the
direction
that
Harry
was
pointing
crashed
into
the
ceiling
and
nearly
fell
off
his
broom
got
close
Harry
called
not
taking
his
eyes
off
the
key
with
the
damaged
wing
Ron
you
come
from
above
Hermione
stay
below
and
stop
from
going
down
and
try
and
catch
Right
NOW
Ron
dived
Hermione
rocketed
upward
the
key
dodged
them
both
and
Harry
streaked
after
sped
toward
the
wall
Harry
leaned
forward
and
with
nasty
crunching
noise
pinned
against
the
stone
with
one
hand
Ron
and
Hermione
cheers
echoed
around
the
high
chamber
They
landed
quickly
and
Harry
ran
the
door
the
key
struggling
his
hand
rammed
into
the
lock
and
turned
worked
The
moment
the
lock
had
clicked
open
the
key
took
flight
again
looking
very
battered
now
that
had
been
caught
twice
Ready
Harry
asked
the
other
two
his
hand
the
door
handle
They
nodded
pulled
the
door
open
The
next
chamber
was
dark
they
couldn
see
anything
all
But
they
stepped
into
light
suddenly
flooded
the
room
reveal
astonishing
sight
They
were
standing
the
edge
huge
chessboard
behind
the
black
chessmen
which
were
all
taller
than
they
were
and
carved
from
what
looked
like
black
stone
Facing
them
way
across
the
chamber
were
the
white
pieces
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
shivered
slightly
the
towering
white
chessmen
had
faces
Now
what
Harry
whispered
obvious
isn
said
Ron
got
play
our
way
across
the
room
Behind
the
white
pieces
they
could
see
another
door
How
said
Hermione
nervously
think
said
Ron
going
have
chessmen
walked
black
knight
and
put
his
hand
out
touch
the
knight
horse
once
the
stone
sprang
life
The
horse
pawed
the
ground
and
the
knight
turned
his
helmeted
head
look
down
Ron
have
join
you
get
across
The
black
knight
nodded
Ron
turned
the
other
two
This
needs
thinking
about
said
suppose
got
take
the
place
three
the
black
pieces
Harry
and
Hermione
stayed
quiet
watching
Ron
think
Finally
said
Now
don
offended
anything
but
neither
you
are
that
good
chess
not
offended
said
Harry
quickly
Just
tell
what
Well
Harry
you
take
the
place
that
bishop
and
Hermione
YOU
next
him
instead
that
castle
What
about
you
going
knight
said
Ron
The
chessmen
seemed
have
been
listening
because
these
words
knight
bishop
and
castle
turned
their
backs
the
white
pieces
and
walked
off
the
board
leaving
three
empty
squares
that
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
took
White
always
plays
first
chess
said
Ron
peering
across
the
board
Yes
look
white
pawn
had
moved
forward
two
squares
Ron
started
direct
the
black
pieces
They
moved
silently
wherever
sent
them
Harry
knees
were
trembling
What
they
lost
Harry
move
diagonally
four
squares
the
right
Their
first
real
shock
came
when
their
other
knight
was
taken
The
white
queen
smashed
him
the
floor
and
dragged
him
off
the
board
where
lay
quite
still
facedown
Had
let
that
happen
said
Ron
looking
shaken
Leaves
you
free
take
that
bishop
Hermione
Every
time
one
their
men
was
lost
the
white
pieces
showed
mercy
Soon
there
was
huddle
limp
black
players
slumped
along
the
wall
Twice
Ron
only
just
noticed
time
that
Harry
and
Hermione
were
danger
himself
darted
around
the
board
taking
almost
many
white
pieces
they
had
lost
black
ones
nearly
there
muttered
suddenly
Let
think
let
think
The
white
queen
turned
her
blank
face
toward
him
Yes
said
Ron
softly
the
only
way
got
taken
NOF
Harry
and
Hermione
shouted
That
chess
snapped
Ron
You
got
make
some
sacrifices
take
one
step
forward
and
she
take
that
leaves
you
free
checkmate
the
king
Harry
But

want
stop
Snape
not
Ron
Look

don
hurry

the
Stone
There
was
alternative
Ready
Ron
called
his
face
pale
but
determined
Here
now
don
hang
around
once
you
won
stepped
forward
and
the
white
queen
pounced
She
struck
Ron
hard
across
the
head
with
her
stone
arm
and
crashed
the
floor
Hermione
screamed
but
stayed
her
square
the
white
queen
dragged
Ron
one
side
looked
been
knocked
out
Shaking
Harry
moved
three
spaces
the
left
The
white
king
took
off
his
crown
and
threw
Harry
feet
They
had
won
The
chessmen
parted
and
bowed
leaving
the
door
ahead
clear
With
one
last
desperate
look
back
Ron
Harry
and
Hermione
charged
through
the
door
and
the
next
passageway
What
all
right
said
Harry
trying
convince
himself
What
you
reckon
next
had
Sprout
that
was
the
Devil
Snare
Flitwick
must
put
charms
the
keys
McGonagall
transfigured
the
chessmen
make
them
alive
that
leaves
Quirrell
spell
and
Snape
They
had
reached
another
door
All
right
Harry
whispered
Harry
pushed
open
disgusting
smell
filled
their
nostrils
making
both
them
pull
their
robes
over
their
noses
Eyes
watering
they
saw
flat
the
floor
front
them
troll
even
larger
than
the
one
they
had
tackled
out
cold
with
bloody
lump
its
head
glad
didn
have
fight
that
one
Harry
whispered
they
stepped
carefully
over
one
its
massive
legs
Come
can
breathe
pulled
open
the
next
door
both
them
hardly
daring
look
what
came
next
but
there
was
nothing
very
frightening
here
just
table
with
seven
differently
shaped
bottles
standing
line
Snape
said
Harry
What
have
They
stepped
over
the
threshold
and
immediately
fire
sprang
behind
them
the
doorway
wasn
ordinary
fire
either
was
purple
the
same
instant
black
flames
shot
the
doorway
leading
onward
They
were
trapped
Look
Hermione
seized
roll
paper
lying
next
the
bottles
Harry
looked
over
her
shoulder
read
Danger
lies
before
you
while
safety
lies
behind
Two
will
help
you
which
ever
you
would
find
One
among
seven
will
let
you
move
ahead
Another
will
transport
the
drinker
back
instead
Two
among
our
number
hold
only
nettle
wine
Three
are
killers
waiting
bidden
line
Choose
unless
you
wish
stay
here
forevermore
help

your
choice
give
you
these
clues
four
First
however
slyly
the
poison
tries
hide
You
will
always
find
some
nettle
wine
left
side
Second
different
are
those
who
stand
either
end
But
you
would
move
onward
neither
your
friend
Third
you
see
clearly
all
are
different
size
Neither
dwarf
nor
giant
holds
death
their
insides
Fourth
the
second
left
and
the
second
the
right
Are
twins
once
you
taste
them
though
different
first
sight
Hermione
let
out
great
sigh
and
Harry
amazed
saw
that
she
was
smiling
the
very
last
thing
felt
like
doing
Brilliant
said
Hermione
This
isn
magic
logic
puzzle
lot
the
greatest
wizards
haven
got
ounce
logic
they
stuck
here
forever
But

said
Hermione
Everything

this
paper
Seven
bottles
three
are
poison
two
are
wine
one
will
get
safely
through
the
black
fire
and
one
will
get
back
through
the
purple
But
how
know
which
drink
Give
minute
Hermione
read
the
paper
several
times
Then
she
walked
and
down
the
line
bottles
muttering
herself
and
pointing
them
last
she
clapped
her
hands
Got
she
said
The
smallest
bottle
will
get
through
the
black
fire
toward
the
Stone
Harry
looked
the
tiny
bottle
There
only
enough
there
for
one
said
That
hardly
one
swallow
They
looked
each
other
Which
one
will
get
you
back
through
the
purple
flames
Hermione
pointed
rounded
bottle
the
right
end
the
line
You

said
Harry
listen

back
and
get
Ron
Grab
brooms
from
the
flying

room

trapdoor
and

But
Harry

Well

Harry
pointing
his
scar
might
get
lucky
again
Hermione
lip
trembled
and
she
suddenly
dashed
Harry
and
threw
her
arms
around
him
Hermione
Harry
you
great
wizard
you
know
not
good
you
said
Harry
very
embarrassed
she
let
him
said
Hermione
Books
And
cleverness
There
are
more
important
things
friendship
and
bravery
and
Harry
careful
You
drink
first
said
Harry
You
are
sure
which
which
aren
you
Positive
said
Hermione
She
took
long
drink
from
the
round
bottle
the
end
and
shuddered
not
poison
said
Harry
anxiously
but
like
ice
Quick
before
wears
off
Good
luck
take
care
Hermione
turned
and
walked
straight
through
the
purple
fire
Harry
took
deep
breath
and
picked
the
smallest
bottle
turned
face
the
black
flames
Here
come
said
and
drained
the
little
bottle
one
gulp
was
indeed
though
ice
was
flooding
his
body
put
the
bottle
down
and
walked
forward
braced
himself
saw
the
black
flames
licking
his
body
but
couldn
feel
them
for
moment
could
see
nothing
but
dark
fire
then
was
the
other
side

CHAPTER
SEVENTEEN
THE
MAN
WITH
TWO
FACES
was
Quirrell
You
gasped
Harry
Quirrell
smiled
His
face
wasn
twitching
all
said
calmly
wondered
whether
meeting
you
here
Potter
But
thought
Snape
Severus
Quirrell
laughed
and
wasn
his
usual
quivering
treble
either
but
cold
and
sharp
Yes
Severus
does
seem
the
type
doesn
useful
have
him
swooping
around
like
overgrown
bat
Next
him
who
would
suspect
poor
stuttering
Professor
Quirrell
Harry
couldn
take
This
couldn
true
couldn
But
Snape
tried
kill
tried
kill
you
Your
friend
Miss
Granger
accidentally
knocked
over
she
rushed
set
fire
Snape
that
Quidditch
match
She
broke
eye
contact
with
you
Another
few
seconds
and
have
got
you
off
that
broom
have
managed
before
then
Snape
hadn
been
muttering
countercurse
trying
save
you
Snape
was
trying
save
course
said
Quirrell
coolly
Why
you
think
wanted
referee
your
next
match
was
trying
make
sure
didn
again
Funny
really
needn
have
bothered
couldn
anything
with
Dumbledore
watching
All
the
other
teachers
thought
Snape
was
trying
stop
Gryffindor
from
winning
did
make
himself
unpopular
and
what
waste
time
when
after
all
that
going
kill
you
tonight
Quirrell
snapped
his
fingers
Ropes
sprang
out
thin
air
and
wrapped
themselves
tightly
around
Harry
You
too
nosy
live
Potter
Scurrying
around
the
school
Halloween
like
that
for
all
knew
you
seen
coming
look
what
was
guarding
the
Stone
You
let
the
troll
Certainly
have
special
gift
with
trolls
you
must
have
seen
what
did
the
one
the
chamber
back
there
Unfortunately
while
everyone
else
was
running
around
looking
for
Snape
who
already
suspected
went
straight
the
third
floor
head
off
and
not
only
did
troll
fail
beat
you
death
that
three
headed
dog
didn
even
manage
bite
Snape
leg
off
properly
Now
wait
quietly
Potter
need
examine
this
interesting
mirror
was
only
then
that
Harry
realized
what
was
standing
behind
Quirrell
was
the
Mirror
Erised
This
mirror
the
key
finding
the
Stone
Quirrell
murmured
tapping
his
way
around
the
frame
Trust
Dumbledore
come
with
something
like
this
but
London
far
away
the
time
gets
back
All
Harry
could
think
doing
was
keep
Quirrell
talking
and
stop
him
from
concentrating
the
mirror
saw
you
and
Snape
the
forest
blurted
out
Yes
said
Quirrell
idly
walking
around
the
mirror
look
the
back
was
that
time
trying
find
out
how
far
got
suspected
all
along
Tried
frighten
though
could
when
had
Lord
Voldemort
side
Quirrell
came
back
out
from
behind
the
mirror
and
stared
hungrily
into
see
the
Stone
presenting
master
but
where
Harry
struggled
against
the
ropes
binding
him
but
they
didn
give
had
keep
Quirrell
from
giving
his
whole
attention
the
mirror
But
Snape
always
seemed
hate
much
does
said
Quirrell
casually
heavens
yes
was
Hogwarts
with
your
father
didn
you
know
They
loathed
each
other
But
never
wanted
you
dead
But
heard
you
few
days
ago
sobbing
thought
Snape
was
threatening
you
For
the
first
time
spasm
fear
flitted
across
Quirrell
face
Sometimes
said
find
hard
follow
master
instructions
great
wizard
and
weak
You
mean
was
there
the
classroom
with
you
Harry
gasped
with
wherever
said
Quirrell
quietly
met
him
when
traveled
around
the
world
foolish
young
man
was
then
full
ridiculous
ideas
about
good
and
evil
Lord
Voldemort
showed
how
wrong
was
There
good
and
evil
there
only
power
and
those
too
weak
seek
Since
then
have
served
him
faithfully
although
have
let
him
down
many
times
has
had
very
hard
Quirrell
shivered
suddenly
does
not
forgive
mistakes
easily
When
failed
steal
the
stone
from
Gringotts
was
most
displeased
punished
decided
would
have
keep
closer
watch
Quirrell
voice
trailed
away
Harry
was
remembering
his
trip
Diagon
Alley
how
could
have
been
stupid
seen
Quirrell
there
that
very
day
shaken
hands
with
him
the
Leaky
Cauldron
Quirrell
cursed
under
his
breath
don
understand
the
Stone
inside
the
mirror
Should
break
Harry
mind
was
racing
What
want
more
than
anything
else
the
world
the
moment
thought
find
the
Stone
before
Quirrell
does
look
the
mirror
should
see
myseff
finding
which
means
see
where
hidden
But
how
can
look
without
Quirrell
realizing
what
tried
edge
the
left
get
front
the
glass
without
Quirrell
noticing
but
the
ropes
around
his
ankles
were
too
tight
tripped
and
fell
over
Quirrell
ignored
him
was
still
talking
himself
What
does
this
mirror
How
does
work
Help
Master
And
Harry
horror
voice
answered
and
the
voice
seemed
come
from
Quirrell
himself
Use
the
boy
Use
the
boy
Quirrell
rounded
Harry
Yes
Potter
come
here
clapped
his
hands
once
and
the
ropes
binding
Harry
fell
off
Harry
got
slowly
his
feet
Come
here
Quirrell
repeated
Look
the
mirror
and
tell
what
you
see
Harry
walked
toward
him
must
lie
thought
desperately
must
look
and
lie
about
what
see
that
all
Quirrell
moved
close
behind
him
Harry
breathed
the
funny
smell
that
seemed
come
from
Quirrell
turban
closed
his
eyes
stepped
front
the
mirror
and
opened
them
again
saw
his
reflection
pale
and
scared
looking
first
But
moment
later
the
reflection
smiled
him
put
its
hand
into
its
pocket
and
pulled
out
blood
red
stone
winked
and
put
the
Stone
back
its
pocket
and
did
Harry
felt
something
heavy
drop
into
his
real
pocket
Somehow
incredibly
gotten
the
Stone
Well
said
Quirrell
impatiently
What
you
see
Harry
screwed
his
courage
see
myself
shaking
hands
with
Dumbledore
invented
won
the
house
cup
for
Gryffindor
Quirrell
cursed
again
Get
out
the
way
said
Harry
moved
aside
felt
the
Sorcerer
Stone
against
his
leg
Dare
make
break
for
But
hadn
walked
five
paces
before
high
voice
spoke
though
Quirrell
wasn
moving
his
lips
lies
lies
Potter
come
back
here
Quirrell
shouted
Tell
the
truth
What
did
you
just
see
The
high
voice
spoke
again
Let
speak
him
face
face
Master
you
are
not
strong
enough
have
strength
enough
for
this
Harry
felt
Devil
Snare
was
rooting
him
the
spot
couldn
move
muscle
Petrified
watched
Quirrell
reached
and
began
unwrap
his
turban
What
was
going
The
turban
fell
away
Quirrell
head
looked
strangely
small
without
Then
turned
slowly
the
spot
Harry
would
have
screamed
but
couldn
make
sound
Where
there
should
have
been
back
Quirrell
head
there
was
face
the
most
terrible
face
Harry
had
ever
seen
was
chalk
white
with
glaring
red
eyes
and
slits
for
nostrils
like
snake
Harry
Potter
whispered
Harry
tried
take
step
backward
but
his
legs
wouldn
move
See
what
have
become
the
face
said
Mere
shadow
and
vapor
have
form
only
when
can
share
another
body
but
there
have
always
been
those
willing
let
into
their
hearts
and
minds
Unicorn
blood
has
strengthened
these
past
weeks
you
saw
faithful
Quirrell
drinking
for
the
forest
and
once
have
the
Elixir
Life
will
able
create
body
own
Now
why
don
you
give
that
Stone
your
pocket
knew
The
feeling
suddenly
surged
back
into
Harry
legs
stumbled
backward
Don
fool
snarled
the
face
Better
save
your
own
life
and
join
you
meet
the
same
end
your
parents
They
died
begging
for
mercy
LIAR
Harry
shouted
suddenly
Quirrell
was
walking
backward
him
that
Voldemort
could
still
see
him
The
evil
face
was
now
smiling
How
touching
hissed
always
value
bravery
Yes
boy
your
parents
were
brave
killed
your
father
first
and
put
courageous
fight
but
your
mother
needn
have
died
she
was
trying
protect
you
Now
give
the
Stone
unless
you
want
her
have
died
vain
NEVER
Harry
sprang
toward
the
flame
door
but
Voldemort
screamed
SEIZE
HIM
and
the
next
second
Harry
felt
Quirrell
hand
close
his
wrist
once
needle
sharp
pain
seared
across
Harry
scar
his
head
felt
though
was
about
split
two
yelled
struggling
with
all
his
might
and
his
surprise
Quirrell
let
him
The
pain
his
head
lessened
looked
around
wildly
see
where
Quirrell
had
gone
and
saw
him
hunched
pain
looking
his
fingers
they
were
blistering
before
his
eyes
Seize
him
SEIZE
HIM
shrieked
Voldemort
again
and
Quirrell
lunged
knocking
Harry
clean
off
his
feet
landing
top
him
both
hands
around
Harry
neck
Harry
scar
was
almost
blinding
him
with
pain
yet
could
see
Quirrell
howling
agony
Master
cannot
hold
him
hands
hands
And
Quirrell
though
pinning
Harry
the
ground
with
his
knees
let
his
neck
and
stared
bewildered
his
own
palms
Harry
could
see
they
looked
burned
raw
red
and
shiny
Then
kill
him
fool
and
done
screeched
Voldemort
Quirrell
raised
his
hand
perform
deadly
curse
but
Harry
instinct
reached
and
grabbed
Quirrell
face
AAAARGH
Quirrell
rolled
off
him
his
face
blistering
too
and
then
Harry
knew
Quirrell
couldn
touch
his
bare
skin
not
without
suffering
terrible
pain
his
only
chance
was
keep
hold
Quirrell
keep
him
enough
pain
stop
him
from
doing
curse
Harry
jumped
his
feet
caught
Quirrell
the
arm
and
hung
tight
could
Quirrell
screamed
and
tried
throw
Harry
off
the
pain
Harry
head
was
building
couldn
see
could
only
hear
Quirrell
terrible
shrieks
and
Voldemort
yells
KILL
HIM
KILL
HIM
and
other
voices
maybe
Harry
own
head
crying
Harry
Harry
felt
Quirrell
arm
wrenched
from
his
grasp
knew
all
was
lost
and
fell
into
blackness
down
down
down
Something
gold
was
glinting
just
above
him
The
Snitch
tried
catch
but
his
arms
were
too
heavy
blinked
wasn
the
Snitch
all
was
pair
glasses
How
strange
blinked
again
The
smiling
face
Albus
Dumbledore
swam
into
view
above
him
Good
afternoon
Harry
said
Dumbledore
Harry
stared
him
Then
remembered
Sir
The
Stone
was
Quirrell
got
the
Stone
Sir
quick
Calm
yourself
dear
boy
you
are
little
behind
the
times
said
Dumbledore
Quirrell
does
not
have
the
Stone
Then
who
does
Sir
Harry
please
relax
Madam
Pomfrey
will
have
thrown
out
Harry
swallowed
and
looked
around
him
realized
must
the
hospital
wing
was
lying
bed
with
white
linen
sheets
and
next
him
was
table
piled
high
with
what
looked
like
half
the
candy
shop
Tokens
from
your
friends
and
admirers
said
Dumbledore
beaming
What
happened
down
the
dungeons
between
you
and
Professor
Quirrell
complete
secret
naturally
the
whole
school
knows
believe
your
friends
Misters
Fred
and
George
Weasley
were
responsible
for
trying
send
you
toilet
seat
doubt
they
thought
would
amuse
you
Madam
Pomfrey
however
felt
might
not
very
hygienic
and
confiscated
How
long
have
been
here
Three
days
Ronald
Weasley
and
Miss
Granger
will
most
relieved
you
have
come
round
they
have
been
extremely
worried
But
sit
the
Stone
see
you
are
not
distracted
Very
well
the
Stone
Professor
Quirrell
did
not
manage
take
from
you
arrived
time
prevent
that
although
you
were
doing
very
well
your
own
must
say
You
got
there
You
got
Hermione
owl
must
have
crossed
midair
sooner
had
reached
London
than
became
clear
that
the
place
should
was
the
one
had
just
left
arrived
just
time
pull
Quirrell
off
you
was
you
feared
might
too
late
You
nearly
were
couldn
have
kept
him
off
the
Stone
much
longer
Not
the
Stone
boy
you
the
effort
involved
nearly
killed
you
For
one
terrible
moment
there
was
afraid
had
for
the
Stone
has
been
destroyed
Destroyed
said
Harry
blankly
But
your
friend
Nicolas
Flamel
you
know
about
Nicolas
said
Dumbledore
sounding
quite
delighted
You
did
the
thing
properly
didn
you
Well
Nicolas
and
have
had
little
chat
and
agreed
all
for
the
best
But
that
means
and
his
wife
will
die
won
they
They
have
enough
Elixir
stored
set
their
affairs
order
and
then
yes
they
will
die
Dumbledore
smiled
the
look
amazement
Harry
face
one
young
you
sure
seems
incredible
but
Nicolas
and
Perenelle
really
like
going
bed
after
very
very
long
day
After
all
the
well
organized
mind
death
but
the
next
great
adventure
You
know
the
Stone
was
really
not
such
wonderful
thing
much
money
and
life
you
could
want
The
two
things
most
human
beings
would
choose
above
all
the
trouble
humans
have
knack
choosing
precisely
those
things
that
are
worst
for
them
Harry
lay
there
lost
for
words
Dumbledore
hummed
little
and
smiled
the
ceiling
Sir
said
Harry
been
thinking
sir
even
the
Stone
gone
Vol
mean
You
Know
Who
Call
him
Voldemort
Harry
Always
use
the
proper
name
for
things
Fear
name
increases
fear
the
thing
itself
Yes
sir
Well
Voldemort
going
try
other
ways
coming
back
isn
mean
hasn
gone
has
Harry
has
not
still
out
there
somewhere
perhaps
looking
for
another
body
share
not
being
truly
alive
cannot
killed
left
Quirrell
die
shows
just
little
mercy
his
followers
his
enemies
Nevertheless
Harry
while
you
may
only
have
delayed
his
return
power
will
merely
take
someone
else
who
prepared
fight
what
seems
losing
battle
next
time
and
delayed
again
and
again
why
may
never
return
power
Harry
nodded
but
stopped
quickly
because
made
his
head
hurt
Then
said
Sir
there
are
some
other
things
like
know
you
can
tell
things
want
know
the
truth
about
The
truth
Dumbledore
sighed
beautiful
and
terrible
thing
and
should
therefore
treated
with
great
caution
However
shall
answer
your
questions
unless
have
very
good
reason
not
which
case
beg
you
forgive
shall
not
course
lie
Well
Voldemort
said
that
only
killed
mother
because
she
tried
stop
him
from
killing
But
why
would
want
kill
the
first
place
Dumbledore
sighed
very
deeply
this
time
Alas
the
first
thing
you
ask
cannot
tell
you
Not
today
Not
now
You
will
know
one
day
put
from
your
mind
for
now
Harry
When
you
are
older
know
you
hate
hear
this
when
you
are
ready
you
will
know
And
Harry
knew
would
good
argue
But
why
couldn
Quirrell
touch
Your
mother
died
save
you
there
one
thing
Voldemort
cannot
understand
love
didn
realize
that
love
powerful
your
mother
for
you
leaves
its
own
mark
Not
scar
visible
sign
have
been
loved
deeply
even
though
the
person
who
loved
gone
will
give
some
protection
forever
your
very
skin
Quirrell
full
hatred
greed
and
ambition
sharing
his
soul
with
Voldemort
could
not
touch
you
for
this
reason
was
agony
touch
person
marked
something
good
Dumbledore
now
became
very
interested
bird
out
the
windowsill
which
gave
Harry
time
dry
his
eyes
the
sheet
When
had
found
his
voice
again
Harry
said
And
the
invisibility
cloak
you
know
who
sent
your
father
happened
leave
possession
and
thought
you
might
like
Dumbledore
eyes
twinkled
Useful
things
your
father
used
mainly
for
sneaking
off
the
kitchens
steal
food
when
was
here
And
there
something
else
Fire
away
Quirrell
said
Snape
Professor
Snape
Harry
Yes
him
Quirrell
said
hates
because
hated
father
that
true
Well
they
did
rather
detest
each
other
Not
unlike
yourself
and
Malfoy
And
then
your
father
did
something
Snape
could
never
forgive
What
saved
his
life
What
Yes
said
Dumbledore
dreamily
Funny
the
way
people
minds
work
isn
Professor
Snape
couldn
bear
being
your
father
debt
believe
worked
hard
protect
you
this
year
because
felt
that
would
make
him
and
your
father
even
Then
could
back
hating
your
father
memory
peace
Harry
tried
understand
this
but
made
his
head
pound
stopped
And
sir
there
one
more
thing
Just
the
one
How
did
get
the
Stone
out
the
mirror
now
glad
you
asked
that
was
one
more
brilliant
ideas
and
between
you
and
that
saying
something
You
see
only
one
who
wanted
find
the
Stone
find
but
not
use
would
able
get
otherwise
they
just
see
themselves
making
gold
drinking
Elixir
Life
brain
surprises
even
sometimes
Now
enough
questions
suggest
you
make
start
these
sweets
Bettie
Bott
Every
Flavor
Beans
was
unfortunate
enough
youth
come
across
vomitflavored
one
and
since
then
afraid
rather
lost
liking
for
them
but
think
safe
with
nice
toffee
don
you
smiled
and
popped
the
golden
brown
bean
into
his
mouth
Then
choked
and
said
Alas
Ear
wax
Madam
Pomfrey
the
nurse
was
nice
woman
but
very
strict
Just
five
minutes
Harry
pleaded
Absolutely
not
You
let
Professor
Dumbledore
Well
course
that
was
the
headmaster
quite
different
You
need
rest
resting
look
lying
down
and
everything
Madam
Pomfrey
very
well
she
said
But
five
minutes
only
And
she
let
Ron
and
Hermione
Harry
Hermione
looked
ready
fling
her
arms
around
him
again
but
Harry
was
glad
she
held
herself
his
head
was
still
very
sore
Harry
were

Ron
What

Ron
and
Hermione

turban
Hermione

huge
banner
showing
the
Slytherin
serpent
covered
the
wall
behind
the
High
Table
When
Harry
walked
there
was
sudden
hush
and
then
everybody
started
talking
loudly
once
slipped
into
seat
between
Ron
and
Hermione
the
Gryffindor
table
and
tried
ignore
the
fact
that
people
were
standing
look
him
Fortunately
Dumbledore
arrived
moments
later
The
babble
died
away
Another

Dumbledore
said
cheerfully

storm
cheering
and
stamping
broke
out
from
the
Slytherin
table
Harry
could
see
Draco
Malfoy
banging
his
goblet
the
table
was
sickening
sight
Yes
Yes

done
Slytherin
said
Dumbledore
However
recent
events
must
taken
into
account
The
room

still
The

her

Harry
strongly
suspected

into
tears
Gryffindors
and
down
the
table
were
beside
themselves
they
were
hundred
points

Dumbledore
The

and
outstanding

points
The
din
was
deafening
Those
who
could
add
while
yelling
themselves
hoarse
knew
that
Gryffindor
now
had
four
hundred
and
seventy
two
points
exactly
the
same
Slytherin
They
had
tied
for
the
house
cup
only
Dumbledore
had
given
Harry
just
one
more
point
Dumbledore
raised
his
hand
The
room
gradually
fell
silent
There

Dumbledore
smiling

Neville
Longbottom
Someone
standing
outside
the
Great
Hall
might
well
have
thought
some
sort
explosion
had
taken
place
loud
was
the
noise
that
erupted
from
the
Gryffindor
table
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stood
yell
and
cheer
Neville
white
with
shock
disappeared
under
pile
people
hugging
him
had
never
won
much
point
for
Gryffindor
before
Harry
still
cheering
nudged
Ron
the
ribs
and
pointed
Malfoy
who
couldn
have
looked
more
stunned
and
horrified
just
had
the
Body
Bind
Curse
put
him
Which
means
Dumbledore
called
over
the
storm
applause
for
even
Ravenclaw
and
Hufflepuff
were
celebrating
the
downfall
Slytherin
need
little
change
decoration
clapped
his
hands
instant
the
green
hangings
became
scarlet
and
the
silver
became
gold
the
huge
Slytherin
serpent
vanished
and
towering
Gryffindor
lion
took
its
place
Snape
was
shaking
Professor
McGonagall
hand
with
horrible
forced
smile
caught
Harry
eye
and
Harry
knew
once
that
Snape
feelings
toward
him
hadn
changed
one
jot
This
didn
worry
Harry
seemed
though
life
would
back
normal
next
year
normal
ever
was
Hogwarts
was
the
best
evening
Harry
life
better
than
winning
Quidditch
Christmas
knocking
out
mountain
trolls
would
never
ever
forget
tonight
Harry
had
almost
forgotten
that
the
exam
results
were
still
come
but
come
they
did
their
great
surprise
both
and
Ron
passed
with
good
marks
Hermione
course
had
the
best
grades
the
first
years
Even
Neville
scraped
through
his
good
Herbology
mark
making
for
his
abysmal
Potions
one
They
had
hoped
that
Goyle
who
was
almost
stupid
was
mean
might
thrown
out
but
had
passed
too
was
shame
but
Ron
said
you
couldn
have
everything
life
And
suddenly
their
wardrobes
were
empty
their
trunks
were
packed
Neville
toad
was
found
lurking
corner
the
toilets
notes
were
handed
out
all
students
warning
them
not
use
magic
over
the
holidays
always
hope
they

said
Fred
Weasley

them
down
the

boats
that
sailed
across
the

they
were
boarding
the
Hogwarts

towns
pulling
off
their
wizard
robes
and
putting

three
quarters
King

quite
while
for

the
ticket
barrier
letting
them
through
the
gate

and
threes
they
didn
attract
attention

Ron

Hermione
