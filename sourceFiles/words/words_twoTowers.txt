_Chapter
The
Departure
Boromir
Aragorn
sped
the
hill
Every
now
and
again
bent
the
ground
Hobbits
light
and
their
footprints
are
not
easy
even
for
Ranger
read
but
not
far
from
the
top
spring
crossed
the
path
and
the
wet
earth
saw
what
was
seeking
read
the
signs
aright
said
himself
Frodo
ran
the
hill
top
wonder
what
saw
there
But
returned
the
same
way
and
went
down
the
hill
again
Aragorn
hesitated
desired
the
high
seat
himself
hoping
see
there
something
that
would
guide
him
his
perplexities
but
time
was
pressing
Suddenly
leaped
forward
and
ran
the
summit
across
the
great
flag
stones
and
the
steps
Then
sitting
the
high
seat
looked
out
But
the
sun
seemed
darkened
and
the
world
dim
and
remote
turned
from
the
North
back
again
North
and
saw
nothing
save
the
distant
hills
unless
were
that
far
away
could
see
again
great
bird
like
eagle
high
the
air
descending
slowly
wide
circles
down
towards
the
earth
Even
gazed
his
quick
ears
caught
sounds
the
woodlands
below
the
west
side
the
River
stiffened
There
were
cries
and
among
them
his
horror
could
distinguish
the
harsh
voices
Orcs
Then
suddenly
with
deep
throated
call
great
horn
blew
and
the
blasts
smote
the
hills
and
echoed
the
hollows
rising
mighty
shout
above
the
roaring
the
falls
The
horn
Boromir
cried
need
sprang
down
the
steps
and
away
leaping
down
the
path
Alas
ill
fate
this
day
and
all
that
goes
amiss
Where
Sam
ran
the
cries
came
louder
but
fainter
now
and
desperately
the
horn
was
blowing
Fierce
and
shrill
rose
the
yells
the
Orcs
and
suddenly
the
horn
calls
ceased
Aragorn
raced
down
the
last
slope
but
before
could
reach
the
hill
foot
the
sounds
died
away
and
turned
the
left
and
ran
towards
them
they
retreated
until
last
could
hear
them
more
Drawing
his
bright
sword
and
crying
_Elendil
Elendil
crashed
through
the
trees
mile
maybe
from
Parth
Galen
little
glade
not
far
from
the
lake
found
Boromir
was
sitting
with
his
back
great
tree
was
resting
But
Aragorn
saw
that
was
pierced
with
many
black
feathered
arrows
his
sword
was
still
his
hand
but
was
broken
near
the
hilt
his
horn
cloven
two
was
his
side
Many
Orcs
lay
slain
piled
all
about
him
and
his
feet
Aragorn
knelt
beside
him
Boromir
opened
his
eyes
and
strove
speak
last
slow
words
came
tried
take
the
Ring
from
Frodo
said
sorry
have
paid
His
glance
strayed
his
fallen
enemies
twenty
least
lay
there
They
have
gone
the
Halflings
the
Orcs
have
taken
them
think
they
are
not
dead
Orcs
bound
them
paused
and
his
eyes
closed
wearily
After
moment
spoke
again
Farewell
Aragorn
Minas
Tirith
and
save
people
have
failed
said
Aragorn
taking
his
hand
and
kissing
his
brow
You
have
conquered
Few
have
gained
such
victory
peace
Minas
Tirith
shall
not
fall
Boromir
smiled
Which
way
did
they
Was
Frodo
there
said
Aragorn
But
Boromir
did
not
speak
again
Alas
said
Aragorn
Thus
passes
the
heir
Denethor
Lord
the
Tower
Guard
This
bitter
end
Now
the
Company
all
ruin
that
have
failed
Vain
was
Gandalf
trust
What
shall
now
Boromir
has
laid
Minas
Tirith
and
heart
desires
but
where
are
the
Ring
and
the
Bearer
How
shall
find
them
and
save
the
Quest
from
disaster
knelt
for
while
bent
with
weeping
still
clasping
Boromir
hand
was
that
Legolas
and
Gimli
found
him
They
came
from
the
western
slopes
the
hill
silently
creeping
through
the
trees
they
were
hunting
Gimli
had
his
axe
hand
and
Legolas
his
long
knife
all
his
arrows
were
spent
When
they
came
into
the
glade
they
halted
amazement
and
then
they
stood
moment
with
heads
bowed
grief
for
seemed
them
plain
what
had
happened
Alas
said
Legolas
coming
Aragorn
side
have
hunted
and
slain
many
Orcs
the
woods
but
should
have
been
more
use
here
came
when
heard
the
horn
but
too
late
seems
fear
you
have
taken
deadly
hurt
Boromir
dead
said
Aragorn
unscathed
for
was
not
here
with
him
fell
defending
the
hobbits
while
was
away
upon
the
hill
The
hobbits
cried
Gimli
Where
are
they
then
Where
Frodo
not
know
answered
Aragorn
wearily
Before
died
Boromir
told
that
the
Orcs
had
bound
them
did
not
think
that
they
were
dead
sent
him
follow
Merry
and
Pippin
but
did
not
ask
him
Frodo
Sam
were
with
him
not
until
was
too
late
All
that
have
done
today
has
gone
amiss
What
done
now
First
must
tend
the
fallen
said
Legolas
cannot
leave
him
lying
like
carrion
among
these
foul
Orcs
But
must
swift
said
Gimli
would
not
wish
linger
must
follow
the
Orcs
there
hope
that
any
our
Company
are
living
prisoners
But
not
know
whether
the
Ring
bearer
with
them
not
said
Aragorn
Are
abandon
him
Must
not
seek
him
first
evil
choice
now
before
Then
let
first
what
must
said
Legolas
have
not
the
time
the
tools
bury
our
comrade
fitly
raise
mound
over
him
cairn
might
build
The
labour
would
hard
and
long
there
are
stones
that
could
use
nearer
than
the
water
side
said
Gimli
Then
let
lay
him
boat
with
his
weapons
and
the
weapons
his
vanquished
foes
said
Aragorn
will
send
him
the
Falls
Rauros
and
give
him
Anduin
The
River
Gondor
will
take
care
least
that
evil
creature
dishonours
his
bones
Quickly
they
searched
the
bodies
the
Orcs
gathering
their
swords
and
cloven
helms
and
shields
into
heap
See
cried
Aragorn
Here
find
tokens
picked
out
from
the
pile
grim
weapons
two
knives
leaf
bladed
damasked
gold
and
red
and
searching
further
found
also
the
sheaths
black
set
with
small
red
gems
orc
tools
these
said
They
were
borne
the
hobbits
Doubtless
the
Orcs
despoiled
them
but
feared
keep
the
knives
knowing
them
for
what
they
are
work
Westernesse
wound
about
with
spells
for
the
bane
Mordor
Well
now
they
still
live
our
friends
are
weaponless
will
take
these
things
hoping
against
hope
give
them
back
And
said
Legolas
will
take
all
the
arrows
that
can
find
for
quiver
empty
searched
the
pile
and
the
ground
about
and
found
not
few
that
were
undamaged
and
longer
the
shaft
than
such
arrows
the
Orcs
were
accustomed
use
looked
them
closely
And
Aragorn
looked
the
slain
and
said
Here
lie
many
that
are
not
folk
Mordor
Some
are
from
the
North
from
the
Misty
Mountains
know
anything
Orcs
and
their
kinds
And
here
are
others
strange
Their
gear
not
after
the
manner
Orcs
all
There
were
four
goblin
soldiers
greater
stature
swart
slant
eyed
with
thick
legs
and
large
hands
They
were
armed
with
short
broad
bladed
swords
not
with
the
curved
scimitars
usual
with
Orcs
and
they
had
bows
yew
length
and
shape
like
the
bows
Men
Upon
their
shields
they
bore
strange
device
small
white
hand
the
centre
black
field
the
front
their
iron
helms
was
set
rune
wrought
some
white
metal
have
not
seen
these
tokens
before
said
Aragorn
What
they
mean
for
Sauron
said
Gimli
That
easy
read
Nay
said
Legolas
Sauron
does
not
use
the
Elf
runes
Neither
does
use
his
right
name
nor
permit
spelt
spoken
said
Aragorn
And
does
not
use
white
The
Orcs
the
service
Barad
dûr
use
the
sign
the
Red
Eye
stood
for
moment
thought
for
Saruman
guess
said
length
There
evil
afoot
Isengard
and
the
West
longer
safe
Gandalf
feared
some
means
the
traitor
Saruman
has
had
news
our
journey
likely
too
that
knows
Gandalf
fall
Pursuers
from
Moria
may
have
escaped
the
vigilance
Lórien
they
may
have
avoided
that
land
and
come
Isengard
other
paths
Orcs
travel
fast
But
Saruman
has
many
ways
learning
news
you
remember
the
birds
Well
have
time
ponder
riddles
said
Gimli
Let
bear
Boromir
away
But
after
that
must
guess
the
riddles
are
choose
our
course
rightly
answered
Aragorn
Maybe
there
right
choice
said
Gimli
Taking
his
axe
the
Dwarf
now
cut
several
branches
These
they
lashed
together
with
bowstrings
and
spread
their
cloaks
upon
the
frame
Upon
this
rough
bier
they
carried
the
body
their
companion
the
shore
together
with
such
trophies
his
last
battle
they
chose
send
forth
with
him
was
only
short
way
yet
they
found
easy
task
for
Boromir
was
man
both
tall
and
strong
the
water
side
Aragorn
remained
watching
the
bier
while
Legolas
and
Gimli
hastened
back
foot
Parth
Galen
was
mile
more
and
was
some
time
before
they
came
back
paddling
two
boats
swiftly
along
the
shore
There
strange
tale
tell
said
Legolas
There
are
only
two
boats
upon
the
bank
could
find
trace
the
other
Have
Orcs
been
there
asked
Aragorn
saw
signs
them
answered
Gimli
And
Orcs
would
have
taken
destroyed
all
the
boats
and
the
baggage
well
will
look
the
ground
when
come
there
said
Aragorn
Now
they
laid
Boromir
the
middle
the
boat
that
was
bear
him
away
The
grey
hood
and
elven
cloak
they
folded
and
placed
beneath
his
head
They
combed
his
long
dark
hair
and
arrayed
upon
his
shoulders
The
golden
belt
Lórien
gleamed
about
his
waist
His
helm
they
set
beside
him
and
across
his
lap
they
laid
the
cloven
horn
and
the
hilts
and
shards
his
sword
beneath
his
feet
they
put
the
swords
his
enemies
Then
fastening
the
prow
the
stern
the
other
boat
they
drew
him
out
into
the
water
They
rowed
sadly
along
the
shore
and
turning
into
the
swift
running
channel
they
passed
the
green
sward
Parth
Galen
The
steep
sides
Tol
Brandir
were
glowing
was
now
mid
afternoon
they
went
south
the
fume
Rauros
rose
and
shimmered
before
them
haze
gold
The
rush
and
thunder
the
falls
shook
the
windless
air
Sorrowfully
they
cast
loose
the
funeral
boat
there
Boromir
lay
restful
peaceful
gliding
upon
the
bosom
the
flowing
water
The
stream
took
him
while
they
held
their
own
boat
back
with
their
paddles
floated
them
and
slowly
his
boat
departed
waning
dark
spot
against
the
golden
light
and
then
suddenly
vanished
Rauros
roared
unchanging
The
River
had
taken
Boromir
son
Denethor
and
was
not
seen
again
Minas
Tirith
standing
used
stand
upon
the
White
Tower
the
morning
But
Gondor
after
days
long
was
said
that
the
elven
boat
rode
the
falls
and
the
foaming
pool
and
bore
him
down
through
Osgiliath
and
past
the
many
mouths
Anduin
out
into
the
Great
Sea
night
under
the
stars
For
while
the
three
companions
remained
silent
gazing
after
him
Then
Aragorn
spoke
They
will
look
for
him
from
the
White
Tower
said
but
will
not
return
from
mountain
from
sea
Then
slowly
began
sing
Through
Rohan
over
fen
and
field
where
the
long
grass
grows
The
West
Wind
comes
walking
and
about
the
walls
goes
What
news
from
the
West
wandering
wind
you
bring
tonight
Have
you
seen
Boromir
the
Tall
moon
starlight
saw
him
ride
over
seven
streams
over
waters
wide
and
grey
saw
him
walk
empty
lands
until
passed
away
Into
the
shadows
the
North
saw
him
then
more
The
North
Wind
may
have
heard
the
horn
the
son
Denethor
Boromir
From
the
high
walls
westward
looked
afar
But
you
came
not
from
the
empty
lands
where
men
are
Then
Legolas
sang
From
the
mouths
the
Sea
the
South
Wind
flies
from
the
sandhills
and
the
stones
The
wailing
the
gulls
bears
and
the
gate
moans
What
news
from
the
South
sighing
wind
you
bring
eve
Where
now
Boromir
the
Fair
tarries
and
grieve
Ask
not
where
doth
dwell
many
bones
there
lie
the
white
shores
and
the
dark
shores
under
the
stormy
sky
many
have
passed
down
Anduin
find
the
flowing
Sea
Ask
the
North
Wind
news
them
the
North
Wind
sends
Boromir
Beyond
the
gate
the
seaward
road
runs
south
But
you
came
not
with
the
wailing
gulls
from
the
grey
sea
mouth
Then
Aragorn
sang
again
From
the
Gate
Kings
the
North
Wind
rides
and
past
the
roaring
falls
And
clear
and
cold
about
the
tower
its
loud
horn
calls
What
news
from
the
North
mighty
wind
you
bring
today
What
news
Boromir
the
Bold
For
long
away
Beneath
Amon
Hen
heard
his
cry
There
many
foes
fought
His
cloven
shield
his
broken
sword
they
the
water
brought
His
head
proud
his
face
fair
his
limbs
they
laid
rest
And
Rauros
golden
Rauros
falls
bore
him
upon
its
breast
Boromir
The
Tower
Guard
shall
ever
northward
gaze
Rauros
golden
Rauros
falls
until
the
end
days
they
ended
Then
they
turned
their
boat
and
drove
with
all
the
speed
they
could
against
the
stream
back
Parth
Galen
You
left
the
East
Wind
said
Gimli
but
will
say
naught
That
should
said
Aragorn
Minas
Tirith
they
endure
the
East
Wind
but
they
not
ask
for
tidings
But
now
Boromir
has
taken
his
road
and
must
make
haste
choose
our
own
surveyed
the
green
lawn
quickly
but
thoroughly
stooping
often
the
earth
The
Orcs
have
been
this
ground
said
Otherwise
nothing
can
made
out
for
certain
All
our
footprints
are
here
crossing
and
crossing
cannot
tell
whether
any
the
hobbits
have
come
back
since
the
search
for
Frodo
began
returned
the
bank
close
where
the
rill
from
the
spring
trickled
out
into
the
River
There
are
some
clear
prints
here
said
hobbit
waded
out
into
the
water
and
back
but
cannot
say
how
long
ago
How
then
you
read
this
riddle
asked
Gimli
Aragorn
did
not
answer
once
but
went
back
the
camping
place
and
looked
the
baggage
Two
packs
are
missing
said
and
one
certainly
Sam
was
rather
large
and
heavy
This
then
the
answer
Frodo
has
gone
boat
and
his
servant
has
gone
with
him
Frodo
must
have
returned
while
were
all
away
met
Sam
going
the
hill
and
told
him
follow
but
plainly
did
not
guessed
his
master
mind
and
came
back
here
before
Frodo
had
gone
did
not
find
easy
leave
Sam
behind
But
why
should
leave
behind
and
without
word
said
Gimli
That
was
strange
deed
And
brave
deed
said
Aragorn
Sam
was
right
think
Frodo
did
not
wish
lead
any
friend
death
with
him
Mordor
But
knew
that
must
himself
Something
happened
after
left
that
overcame
his
fear
and
doubt
Maybe
hunting
Orcs
came
him
and
fled
said
Legolas
fled
certainly
said
Aragorn
but
not
think
from
Orcs
What
thought
was
the
cause
Frodo
sudden
resolve
and
flight
Aragorn
did
not
say
The
last
words
Boromir
long
kept
secret
Well
much
least
now
clear
said
Legolas
Frodo
longer
this
side
the
River
only
can
have
taken
the
boat
And
Sam
with
him
only
would
have
taken
his
pack
Our
choice
then
said
Gimli
either
take
the
remaining
boat
and
follow
Frodo
else
follow
the
Orcs
foot
There
little
hope
either
way
have
already
lost
precious
hours
Let
think
said
Aragorn
And
now
may
make
right
choice
and
change
the
evil
fate
this
unhappy
day
stood
silent
for
moment
will
follow
the
Orcs
said
last
would
have
guided
Frodo
Mordor
and
gone
with
him
the
end
but
seek
him
now
the
wilderness
must
abandon
the
captives
torment
and
death
heart
speaks
clearly
last
the
fate
the
Bearer
hands
longer
The
Company
has
played
its
part
Yet
that
remain
cannot
forsake
our
companions
while
have
strength
left
Come
will
now
Leave
all
that
can
spared
behind
will
press
day
and
dark
They
drew
the
last
boat
and
carried
the
trees
They
laid
beneath
such
their
goods
they
did
not
need
and
could
not
carry
away
Then
they
left
Parth
Galen
The
afternoon
was
fading
they
came
back
the
glade
where
Boromir
had
fallen
There
they
picked
the
trail
the
Orcs
needed
little
skill
find
other
folk
make
such
trampling
said
Legolas
seems
their
delight
slash
and
beat
down
growing
things
that
are
not
even
their
way
But
they
with
great
speed
for
all
that
said
Aragorn
and
they
not
tire
And
later
may
have
search
for
our
path
hard
bare
lands
Well
after
them
said
Gimli
Dwarves
too
can
swiftly
and
they
not
tire
sooner
than
Orcs
But
will
long
chase
they
have
long
start
Yes
said
Aragorn
shall
all
need
the
endurance
Dwarves
But
come
With
hope
without
hope
will
follow
the
trail
our
enemies
And
woe
them
prove
the
swifter
will
make
such
chase
shall
accounted
marvel
among
the
Three
Kindreds
Elves
Dwarves
and
Men
Forth
the
Three
Hunters
Like
deer
sprang
away
Through
the
trees
sped
and
led
them
tireless
and
swift
now
that
his
mind
was
last
made
The
woods
about
the
lake
they
left
behind
Long
slopes
they
climbed
dark
hard
edged
against
the
sky
already
red
with
sunset
Dusk
came
They
passed
away
grey
shadows
stony
land
_Chapter
The
Riders
Rohan
Dusk
deepened
Mist
lay
behind
them
among
the
trees
below
and
brooded
the
pale
margins
the
Anduin
but
the
sky
was
clear
Stars
came
out
The
waxing
moon
was
riding
the
West
and
the
shadows
the
rocks
were
black
They
had
come
the
feet
stony
hills
and
their
pace
was
slower
for
the
trail
was
longer
easy
follow
Here
the
highlands
the
Emyn
Muil
ran
from
North
South
two
long
tumbled
ridges
The
western
side
each
ridge
was
steep
and
difficult
but
the
eastward
slopes
were
gentler
furrowed
with
many
gullies
and
narrow
ravines
All
night
the
three
companions
scrambled
this
bony
land
climbing
the
crest
the
first
and
tallest
ridge
and
down
again
into
the
darkness
deep
winding
valley
the
other
side
There
the
still
cool
hour
before
dawn
they
rested
for
brief
space
The
moon
had
long
gone
down
before
them
the
stars
glittered
above
them
the
first
light
day
had
not
yet
come
over
the
dark
hills
behind
For
the
moment
Aragorn
was
loss
the
orc
trail
had
descended
into
the
valley
but
there
had
vanished
Which
way
would
they
turn
you
think
said
Legolas
Northward
take
straighter
road
Isengard
Fangorn
that
their
aim
you
guess
southward
strike
the
Entwash
They
will
not
make
for
the
river
whatever
mark
they
aim
said
Aragorn
And
unless
there
much
amiss
Rohan
and
the
power
Saruman
greatly
increased
they
will
take
the
shortest
way
that
they
can
find
over
the
fields
the
Rohirrim
Let
search
northwards
The
dale
ran
like
stony
trough
between
the
ridged
hills
and
trickling
stream
flowed
among
the
boulders
the
bottom
cliff
frowned
upon
their
right
their
left
rose
grey
slopes
dim
and
shadowy
the
late
night
They
went
for
mile
more
northwards
Aragorn
was
searching
bent
towards
the
ground
among
the
folds
and
gullies
leading
into
the
western
ridge
Legolas
was
some
way
ahead
Suddenly
the
Elf
gave
cry
and
the
others
came
running
towards
him
have
already
overtaken
some
those
that
are
hunting
said
Look
pointed
and
they
saw
that
what
they
had
first
taken
boulders
lying
the
foot
the
slope
were
huddled
bodies
Five
dead
Orcs
lay
there
They
had
been
hewn
with
many
cruel
strokes
and
two
had
been
beheaded
The
ground
was
wet
with
their
dark
blood
Here
another
riddle
said
Gimli
But
needs
the
light
day
and
for
that
cannot
wait
Yet
however
you
read
seems
not
unhopeful
said
Legolas
Enemies
the
Orcs
are
likely
our
friends
any
folk
dwell
these
hills
said
Aragorn
The
Rohirrim
seldom
come
here
and
far
from
Minas
Tirith
might
that
some
company
Men
were
hunting
here
for
reasons
that
not
know
Yet
think
not
What
you
think
said
Gimli
think
that
the
enemy
brought
his
own
enemy
with
him
answered
Aragorn
These
are
Northern
Orcs
from
far
away
Among
the
slain
are
none
the
great
Orcs
with
the
strange
badges
There
was
quarrel
guess
uncommon
thing
with
these
foul
folk
Maybe
there
was
some
dispute
about
the
road
about
the
captives
said
Gimli
Let
hope
that
they
too
did
not
meet
their
end
here
Aragorn
searched
the
ground
wide
circle
but
other
traces
the
fight
could
found
They
went
Already
the
eastward
sky
was
turning
pale
the
stars
were
fading
and
grey
light
was
slowly
growing
little
further
north
they
came
fold
which
tiny
stream
falling
and
winding
had
cut
stony
path
down
into
the
valley
some
bushes
grew
and
there
were
patches
grass
upon
its
sides
last
said
Aragorn
Here
are
the
tracks
that
seek
this
water
channel
this
the
way
that
the
Orcs
went
after
their
debate
Swiftly
now
the
pursuers
turned
and
followed
the
new
path
fresh
from
night
rest
they
sprang
from
stone
stone
last
they
reached
the
crest
the
grey
hill
and
sudden
breeze
blew
their
hair
and
stirred
their
cloaks
the
chill
wind
dawn
Turning
back
they
saw
across
the
River
the
far
hills
kindled
Day
leaped
into
the
sky
The
red
rim
the
sun
rose
over
the
shoulders
the
dark
land
Before
them
the
West
the
world
lay
still
formless
and
grey
but
even
they
looked
the
shadows
night
melted
the
colours
the
waking
earth
returned
green
flowed
over
the
wide
meads
Rohan
the
white
mists
shimmered
the
watervales
and
far
off
the
left
thirty
leagues
more
blue
and
purple
stood
the
White
Mountains
rising
into
peaks
jet
tipped
with
glimmering
snows
flushed
with
the
rose
morning
Gondor
Gondor
cried
Aragorn
Would
that
looked
you
again
happier
hour
Not
yet
does
road
lie
southward
your
bright
streams
Gondor
Gondor
between
the
Mountains
and
the
Sea
West
Wind
blew
there
the
light
upon
the
Silver
Tree
Fell
like
bright
rain
gardens
the
Kings
old
proud
walls
White
towers
winged
crown
and
throne
gold
Gondor
Gondor
Shall
Men
behold
the
Silver
Tree
West
Wind
blow
again
between
the
Mountains
and
the
Sea
Now
let
said
drawing
his
eyes
away
from
the
South
and
looking
out
west
and
north
the
way
that
must
tread
The
ridge
upon
which
the
companions
stood
went
down
steeply
before
their
feet
Below
twenty
fathoms
more
there
was
wide
and
rugged
shelf
which
ended
suddenly
the
brink
sheer
cliff
the
East
Wall
Rohan
ended
the
Emyn
Muil
and
the
green
plains
the
Rohirrim
stretched
away
before
them
the
edge
sight
Look
cried
Legolas
pointing
into
the
pale
sky
above
them
There
the
eagle
again
very
high
seems
flying
now
away
from
this
land
back
the
North
going
with
great
speed
Look
not
even
eyes
can
see
him
good
Legolas
said
Aragorn
must
far
aloft
indeed
wonder
what
his
errand
the
same
bird
that
have
seen
before
But
look
can
see
something
nearer
hand
and
more
urgent
there
something
moving
over
the
plain
Many
things
said
Legolas
great
company
foot
but
cannot
say
more
nor
see
what
kind
folk
they
may
They
are
many
leagues
away
twelve
guess
but
the
flatness
the
plain
hard
measure
think
nonetheless
that
longer
need
any
trail
tell
which
way
said
Gimli
Let
find
path
down
the
fields
quick
may
doubt
you
will
find
path
quicker
than
the
one
that
the
Orcs
chose
said
Aragorn
They
followed
their
enemies
now
the
clear
light
day
seemed
that
the
Orcs
had
pressed
with
all
possible
speed
Every
now
and
again
the
pursuers
found
things
that
had
been
dropped
cast
away
food
bags
the
rinds
and
crusts
hard
grey
bread
torn
black
cloak
heavy
iron
nailed
shoe
broken
the
stones
The
trail
led
them
north
along
the
top
the
escarpment
and
length
they
came
deep
cleft
carved
the
rock
stream
that
splashed
noisily
down
the
narrow
ravine
rough
path
descended
like
steep
stair
into
the
plain
the
bottom
they
came
with
strange
suddenness
the
grass
Rohan
swelled
like
green
sea
the
very
foot
the
Emyn
Muil
The
falling
stream
vanished
into
deep
growth
cresses
and
water
plants
and
they
could
hear
tinkling
away
green
tunnels
down
long
gentle
slopes
towards
the
fens
Entwash
Vale
far
away
They
seemed
have
left
winter
clinging
the
hills
behind
Here
the
air
was
softer
and
warmer
and
faintly
scented
spring
was
already
stirring
and
the
sap
was
flowing
again
herb
and
leaf
Legolas
took
deep
breath
like
one
that
drinks
great
draught
after
long
thirst
barren
places
the
green
smell
said
better
than
much
sleep
Let
run
Light
feet
may
run
swiftly
here
said
Aragorn
More
swiftly
maybe
than
iron
shod
Orcs
Now
have
chance
lessen
their
lead
They
went
single
file
running
like
hounds
strong
scent
and
eager
light
was
their
eyes
Nearly
due
west
the
broad
swath
the
marching
Orcs
tramped
its
ugly
slot
the
sweet
grass
Rohan
had
been
bruised
and
blackened
they
passed
Presently
Aragorn
gave
cry
and
turned
aside
Stay
shouted
not
follow
yet
ran
quickly
the
right
away
from
the
main
trail
for
had
seen
footprints
that
went
that
way
branching
off
from
the
others
the
marks
small
unshod
feet
These
however
did
not
far
before
they
were
crossed
orc
prints
also
coming
out
from
the
main
trail
behind
and
front
and
then
they
curved
sharply
back
again
and
were
lost
the
trampling
the
furthest
point
Aragorn
stooped
and
picked
something
from
the
grass
then
ran
back
Yes
said
they
are
quite
plain
hobbit
footprints
Pippin
think
smaller
than
the
other
And
look
this
held
thing
that
glittered
the
sunlight
looked
like
the
new
opened
leaf
beech
tree
fair
and
strange
that
treeless
plain
The
brooch
elven
cloak
cried
Legolas
and
Gimli
together
Not
idly
the
leaves
Lórien
fall
said
Aragorn
This
did
not
drop
chance
was
cast
away
token
any
that
might
follow
think
Pippin
ran
away
from
the
trail
for
that
purpose
Then
least
was
alive
said
Gimli
And
had
the
use
his
wits
and
his
legs
too
That
heartening
not
pursue
vain
Let
hope
that
did
not
pay
too
dearly
for
his
boldness
said
Legolas
Come
Let
The
thought
those
merry
young
folk
driven
like
cattle
burns
heart
The
sun
climbed
the
noon
and
then
rode
slowly
down
the
sky
Light
clouds
came
out
the
sea
the
distant
South
and
were
blown
away
upon
the
breeze
The
sun
sank
Shadows
rose
behind
and
reached
out
long
arms
from
the
East
Still
the
hunters
held
One
day
now
had
passed
since
Boromir
fell
and
the
Orcs
were
yet
far
ahead
longer
could
any
sight
them
seen
the
level
plains
nightshade
was
closing
about
them
Aragorn
halted
Only
twice
the
day
march
had
they
rested
for
brief
while
and
twelve
leagues
now
lay
between
them
and
the
eastern
wall
where
they
had
stood
dawn
have
come
last
hard
choice
said
Shall
rest
night
shall
while
our
will
and
strength
hold
Unless
our
enemies
rest
also
they
will
leave
far
behind
stay
sleep
said
Legolas
Surely
even
Orcs
must
pause
the
march
said
Gimli
Seldom
will
Orcs
journey
the
open
under
the
sun
yet
these
have
done
said
Legolas
Certainly
they
will
not
rest
night
But
walk
night
cannot
follow
their
trail
said
Gimli
The
trail
straight
and
turns
neither
right
nor
left
far
eyes
can
see
said
Legolas
Maybe
could
lead
you
guess
the
darkness
and
hold
the
line
said
Aragorn
but
strayed
they
turned
aside
then
when
light
came
there
might
long
delay
before
the
trail
was
found
again
And
there
this
also
said
Gimli
only
day
can
see
any
tracks
lead
away
prisoner
should
escape
one
should
carried
off
eastward
say
the
Great
River
towards
Mordor
might
pass
the
signs
and
never
know
That
true
said
Aragorn
But
read
the
signs
back
yonder
rightly
the
Orcs
the
White
Hand
prevailed
and
the
whole
company
now
bound
for
Isengard
Their
present
course
bears
out
Yet
would
rash
sure
their
counsels
said
Gimli
And
what
escape
the
dark
should
have
passed
the
signs
that
led
you
the
brooch
The
Orcs
will
doubly
their
guard
since
then
and
the
prisoners
even
wearier
said
Legolas
There
will
escape
again
not
contrive
How
that
done
cannot
guessed
but
first
must
overtake
them
And
yet
even
Dwarf
many
journeys
and
not
the
least
hardy
folk
cannot
run
all
the
way
Isengard
without
any
pause
said
Gimli
heart
burns
too
and
would
have
started
sooner
but
now
must
rest
little
run
the
better
And
rest
then
the
blind
night
the
time
said
that
was
hard
choice
said
Aragorn
How
shall
end
this
debate
You
are
our
guide
said
Gimli
and
you
are
skilled
the
chase
You
shall
choose
heart
bids
said
Legolas
But
must
hold
together
will
follow
your
counsel
You
give
the
choice
ill
chooser
said
Aragorn
Since
passed
through
the
Argonath
choices
have
gone
amiss
fell
silent
gazing
north
and
west
into
the
gathering
night
for
long
while
will
not
walk
the
dark
said
length
The
peril
missing
the
trail
signs
other
coming
and
going
seems
the
greater
the
Moon
gave
enough
light
would
use
but
alas
sets
early
and
yet
young
and
pale
And
tonight
shrouded
anyway
Gimli
murmured
Would
that
the
Lady
had
given
light
such
gift
she
gave
Frodo
will
more
needed
where
bestowed
said
Aragorn
With
him
lies
the
true
Quest
Ours
but
small
matter
the
great
deeds
this
time
vain
pursuit
from
its
beginning
maybe
which
choice
mine
can
mar
mend
Well
have
chosen
let
use
the
time
best
may
cast
himself
the
ground
and
fell
once
into
sleep
for
had
not
slept
since
their
night
under
the
shadow
Tol
Brandir
Before
dawn
was
the
sky
woke
and
rose
Gimli
was
still
deep
slumber
but
Legolas
was
standing
gazing
northwards
into
the
darkness
thoughtful
and
silent
young
tree
windless
night
They
are
far
far
away
said
sadly
turning
Aragorn
know
heart
that
they
have
not
rested
this
night
Only
eagle
could
overtake
them
now
Nonetheless
will
still
follow
may
said
Aragorn
Stooping
roused
the
Dwarf
Come
must
said
The
scent
growing
cold
But
still
dark
said
Gimli
Even
Legolas
hill
top
could
not
see
them
till
the
Sun
fear
they
have
passed
beyond
sight
from
hill
plain
under
moon
sun
said
Legolas
Where
sight
fails
the
earth
may
bring
rumour
said
Aragorn
The
land
must
groan
under
their
hated
feet
stretched
himself
upon
the
ground
with
his
ear
pressed
against
the
turf
lay
there
motionless
for
long
time
that
Gimli
wondered
had
swooned
fallen
asleep
again
Dawn
came
glimmering
and
slowly
grey
light
grew
about
them
last
rose
and
now
his
friends
could
see
his
face
was
pale
and
drawn
and
his
look
was
troubled
The
rumour
the
earth
dim
and
confused
said
Nothing
walks
upon
for
many
miles
about
Faint
and
far
are
the
feet
our
enemies
But
loud
are
the
hoofs
the
horses
comes
mind
that
heard
them
even
lay
the
ground
sleep
and
they
troubled
dreams
horses
galloping
passing
the
West
But
now
they
are
drawing
ever
further
from
riding
northward
wonder
what
happening
this
land
Let
said
Legolas
the
third
day
their
pursuit
began
During
all
its
long
hours
cloud
and
fitful
sun
they
hardly
paused
now
striding
now
running
weariness
could
quench
the
fire
that
burned
them
They
seldom
spoke
Over
the
wide
solitude
they
passed
and
their
elven
cloaks
faded
against
the
background
the
grey
green
fields
even
the
cool
sunlight
mid
day
few
but
elvish
eyes
would
have
marked
them
until
they
were
close
hand
Often
their
hearts
they
thanked
the
Lady
Lórien
for
the
gift
_lembas_
for
they
could
eat
and
find
new
strength
even
they
ran
All
day
the
track
their
enemies
led
straight
going
north
west
without
break
turn
once
again
the
day
wore
its
end
they
came
long
treeless
slopes
where
the
land
rose
swelling
towards
line
low
humpbacked
downs
ahead
The
orc
trail
grew
fainter
bent
north
towards
them
for
the
ground
became
harder
and
the
grass
shorter
Far
away
the
left
the
river
Entwash
wound
silver
thread
green
floor
moving
thing
could
seen
Often
Aragorn
wondered
that
they
saw
sign
beast
man
The
dwellings
the
Rohirrim
were
for
the
most
part
many
leagues
away
the
South
under
the
wooded
eaves
the
White
Mountains
now
hidden
mist
and
cloud
yet
the
Horse
lords
had
formerly
kept
many
herds
and
studs
the
Eastemnet
this
easterly
region
their
realm
and
there
the
herdsmen
had
wandered
much
living
camp
and
tent
even
winter
time
But
now
all
the
land
was
empty
and
there
was
silence
that
did
not
seem
the
quiet
peace
dusk
they
halted
again
Now
twice
twelve
leagues
they
had
passed
over
the
plains
Rohan
and
the
wall
the
Emyn
Muil
was
lost
the
shadows
the
East
The
young
moon
was
glimmering
misty
sky
but
gave
small
light
and
the
stars
were
veiled
Now
most
grudge
time
rest
any
halt
our
chase
said
Legolas
The
Orcs
have
run
before
the
very
whips
Sauron
were
behind
them
fear
they
have
already
reached
the
forest
and
the
dark
hills
and
even
now
are
passing
into
the
shadows
the
trees
Gimli
ground
his
teeth
This
bitter
end
our
hope
and
all
our
toil
said
hope
maybe
but
not
toil
said
Aragorn
shall
not
turn
back
here
Yet
weary
gazed
back
along
the
way
that
they
had
come
towards
the
night
gathering
the
East
There
something
strange
work
this
land
distrust
the
silence
distrust
even
the
pale
Moon
The
stars
are
faint
and
weary
have
seldom
been
before
weary
Ranger
should
with
clear
trail
follow
There
some
will
that
lends
speed
our
foes
and
sets
unseen
barrier
before
weariness
that
the
heart
more
than
the
limb
Truly
said
Legolas
That
have
known
since
first
came
down
from
the
Emyn
Muil
For
the
will
not
behind
but
before
pointed
away
over
the
land
Rohan
into
the
darkling
West
under
the
sickle
moon
Saruman
muttered
Aragorn
But
shall
not
turn
back
Halt
must
once
more
for
see
even
the
Moon
falling
into
gathering
cloud
But
north
lies
our
road
between
down
and
fen
when
day
returns
before
Legolas
was
first
afoot
indeed
had
ever
slept
Awake
Awake
cried
red
dawn
Strange
things
await
the
eaves
the
forest
Good
evil
not
know
but
are
called
Awake
The
others
sprang
and
almost
once
they
set
off
again
Slowly
the
downs
drew
near
was
still
hour
before
noon
when
they
reached
them
green
slopes
rising
bare
ridges
that
ran
line
straight
towards
the
North
their
feet
the
ground
was
dry
and
the
turf
short
but
long
strip
sunken
land
some
ten
miles
wide
lay
between
them
and
the
river
wandering
deep
dim
thickets
reed
and
rush
Just
the
West
the
southernmost
slope
there
was
great
ring
where
the
turf
had
been
torn
and
beaten
many
trampling
feet
From
the
orc
trail
ran
out
again
turning
north
along
the
dry
skirts
the
hills
Aragorn
halted
and
examined
the
tracks
closely
They
rested
here
while
said
but
even
the
outward
trail
already
old
fear
that
your
heart
spoke
truly
Legolas
thrice
twelve
hours
guess
since
the
Orcs
stood
where
now
stand
they
held
their
pace
then
sundown
yesterday
they
would
reach
the
borders
Fangorn
can
see
nothing
away
north
west
but
grass
dwindling
into
mist
said
Gimli
Could
see
the
forest
climbed
the
hills
still
far
away
said
Aragorn
remember
rightly
these
downs
run
eight
leagues
more
the
north
and
then
north
west
the
issuing
the
Entwash
there
lies
still
wide
land
another
fifteen
leagues
may
Well
let
said
Gimli
legs
must
forget
the
miles
They
would
more
willing
heart
were
less
heavy
The
sun
was
sinking
when
last
they
drew
near
the
end
the
line
downs
For
many
hours
they
had
marched
without
rest
They
were
going
slowly
now
and
Gimli
back
was
bent
Stone
hard
are
the
Dwarves
labour
journey
but
this
endless
chase
began
tell
him
all
hope
failed
his
heart
Aragorn
walked
behind
him
grim
and
silent
stooping
now
and
again
scan
some
print
mark
upon
the
ground
Only
Legolas
still
stepped
lightly
ever
his
feet
hardly
seeming
press
the
grass
leaving
footprints
passed
but
the
waybread
the
Elves
found
all
the
sustenance
that
needed
and
could
sleep
sleep
could
called
Men
resting
his
mind
the
strange
paths
elvish
dreams
even
walked
open
eyed
the
light
this
world
Let
this
green
hill
said
Wearily
they
followed
him
climbing
the
long
slope
until
they
came
out
upon
the
top
was
round
hill
smooth
and
bare
standing
itself
the
most
northerly
the
downs
The
sun
sank
and
the
shadows
evening
fell
like
curtain
They
were
alone
grey
formless
world
without
mark
measure
Only
far
away
north
west
there
was
deeper
darkness
against
the
dying
light
the
Mountains
Mist
and
the
forest
their
feet
Nothing
can
see
guide
here
said
Gimli
Well
now
must
halt
again
and
wear
the
night
away
growing
cold
The
wind
north
from
the
snows
said
Aragorn
And
ere
morning
will
the
East
said
Legolas
But
rest
you
must
Yet
not
cast
all
hope
away
Tomorrow
unknown
Rede
oft
found
the
rising
the
Sun
Three
suns
already
have
risen
our
chase
and
brought
counsel
said
Gimli
The
night
grew
ever
colder
Aragorn
and
Gimli
slept
fitfully
and
whenever
they
awoke
they
saw
Legolas
standing
beside
them
walking
and
fro
singing
softly
himself
his
own
tongue
and
sang
the
white
stars
opened
the
hard
black
vault
above
the
night
passed
Together
they
watched
the
dawn
grow
slowly
the
sky
now
bare
and
cloudless
until
last
the
sunrise
came
was
pale
and
clear
The
wind
was
the
East
and
all
the
mists
had
rolled
away
wide
lands
lay
bleak
about
them
the
bitter
light
Ahead
and
eastward
they
saw
the
windy
uplands
the
Wold
Rohan
that
they
had
already
glimpsed
many
days
ago
from
the
Great
River
North
westward
stalked
the
dark
forest
Fangorn
still
ten
leagues
away
stood
its
shadowy
eaves
and
its
further
slopes
faded
into
the
distant
blue
Beyond
there
glimmered
far
away
floating
grey
cloud
the
white
head
tall
Methedras
the
last
peak
the
Misty
Mountains
Out
the
forest
the
Entwash
flowed
meet
them
its
stream
now
swift
and
narrow
and
its
banks
deep
cloven
The
orc
trail
turned
from
the
downs
towards
Following
with
his
keen
eyes
the
trail
the
river
and
then
the
river
back
towards
the
forest
Aragorn
saw
shadow
the
distant
green
dark
swift
moving
blur
cast
himself
upon
the
ground
and
listened
again
intently
But
Legolas
stood
beside
him
shading
his
bright
elven
eyes
with
his
long
slender
hand
and
saw
not
shadow
nor
blur
but
the
small
figures
horsemen
many
horsemen
and
the
glint
morning
the
tips
their
spears
was
like
the
twinkle
minute
stars
beyond
the
edge
mortal
sight
Far
behind
them
dark
smoke
rose
thin
curling
threads
There
was
silence
the
empty
fields
arid
Gimli
could
hear
the
air
moving
the
grass
Riders
cried
Aragorn
springing
his
feet
Many
riders
swift
steeds
are
coming
towards
Yes
said
Legolas
there
are
one
hundred
and
five
Yellow
their
hair
and
bright
are
their
spears
Their
leader
very
tall
Aragorn
smiled
Keen
are
the
eyes
the
Elves
said
Nay
The
riders
are
little
more
than
five
leagues
distant
said
Legolas
Five
leagues
one
said
Gimli
cannot
escape
them
this
bare
land
Shall
wait
for
them
here
our
way
will
wait
said
Aragorn
weary
and
our
hunt
has
failed
least
others
were
before
for
these
horsemen
are
riding
back
down
the
orc
trail
may
get
new
from
them
spears
said
Gimli
There
are
three
empty
saddles
but
see
hobbits
said
Legolas
did
not
say
that
should
hear
good
news
said
Aragorn
But
evil
good
will
await
here
The
three
companions
now
left
the
hill
top
where
they
might
easy
mark
against
the
pale
sky
and
they
walked
slowly
down
the
northward
slope
little
above
the
hill
foot
they
halted
and
wrapping
their
cloaks
about
them
they
sat
huddled
together
upon
the
faded
grass
The
time
passed
slowly
and
heavily
The
wind
was
thin
and
searching
Gimli
was
uneasy
What
you
know
these
horsemen
Aragorn
said
sit
here
waiting
for
sudden
death
have
been
among
them
answered
Aragorn
They
are
proud
and
wilful
but
they
are
true
hearted
generous
thought
and
deed
bold
but
not
cruel
wise
but
unlearned
writing
books
but
singing
many
songs
after
the
manner
the
children
Men
before
the
Dark
Years
But
not
know
what
has
happened
here
late
nor
what
mind
the
Rohirrim
may
now
between
the
traitor
Saruman
and
the
threat
Sauron
They
have
long
been
the
friends
the
people
Gondor
though
they
are
not
akin
them
was
forgotten
years
long
ago
that
Eorl
the
Young
brought
them
out
the
North
and
their
kinship
rather
with
the
Bardings
Dale
and
with
the
Beornings
the
Wood
among
whom
may
still
seen
many
men
tall
and
fair
are
the
Riders
Rohan
least
they
will
not
love
the
Orcs
But
Gandalf
spoke
rumour
that
they
pay
tribute
Mordor
said
Gimli
believe
more
than
did
Boromir
answered
Aragorn
You
will
soon
learn
the
truth
said
Legolas
Already
they
approach
length
even
Gimli
could
hear
the
distant
beat
galloping
hoofs
The
horsemen
following
the
trail
had
turned
from
the
river
and
were
drawing
near
the
downs
They
were
riding
like
the
wind
Now
the
cries
clear
strong
voices
came
ringing
over
the
fields
Suddenly
they
swept
with
noise
like
thunder
and
the
foremost
horseman
swerved
passing
the
foot
the
hill
and
leading
the
host
back
southward
along
the
western
skirts
the
downs
After
him
they
rode
long
line
mail
clad
men
swift
shining
fell
and
fair
look
upon
Their
horses
were
great
stature
strong
and
clean
limbed
their
grey
coats
glistened
their
long
tails
flowed
the
wind
their
manes
were
braided
their
proud
necks
The
Men
that
rode
them
matched
them
well
tall
and
long
limbed
their
hair
flaxen
pale
flowed
under
their
light
helms
and
streamed
long
braids
behind
them
their
faces
were
stern
and
keen
their
hands
were
tall
spears
ash
painted
shields
were
slung
their
backs
long
swords
were
their
belts
their
burnished
skirts
mail
hung
down
upon
their
knees
pairs
they
galloped
and
though
every
now
and
then
one
rose
his
stirrups
and
gazed
ahead
and
either
side
they
appeared
not
perceive
the
three
strangers
sitting
silently
and
watching
them
The
host
had
almost
passed
when
suddenly
Aragorn
stood
and
called
loud
voice
What
news
from
the
North
Riders
Rohan
With
astonishing
speed
and
skill
they
checked
their
steeds
wheeled
and
came
charging
round
Soon
the
three
companions
found
themselves
ring
horsemen
moving
running
circle
the
hill
slope
behind
them
and
down
round
and
round
them
and
drawing
ever
inwards
Aragorn
stood
silent
and
the
other
two
sat
without
moving
wondering
what
way
things
would
turn
Without
word
cry
suddenly
the
Riders
halted
thicket
spears
were
pointed
towards
the
strangers
and
some
the
horsemen
had
bows
hand
and
their
arrows
were
already
fitted
the
string
Then
one
rode
forward
tall
man
taller
than
all
the
rest
from
his
helm
crest
white
horsetail
flowed
advanced
until
the
point
his
spear
was
within
foot
Aragorn
breast
Aragorn
did
not
stir
Who
are
you
and
what
are
you
doing
this
land
said
the
Rider
using
the
Common
Speech
the
West
manner
and
tone
like
the
speech
Boromir
Man
Gondor
called
Strider
answered
Aragorn
came
out
the
North
hunting
Orcs
The
Rider
leaped
from
his
horse
Giving
his
spear
another
who
rode
and
dismounted
his
side
drew
his
sword
and
stood
face
face
with
Aragorn
surveying
him
keenly
and
not
without
wonder
length
spoke
again
first
thought
that
you
yourselves
were
Orcs
said
but
now
see
that
not
Indeed
you
know
little
Orcs
you
hunting
them
this
fashion
They
were
swift
and
well
armed
and
they
were
many
You
would
have
changed
from
hunters
prey
ever
you
had
overtaken
them
But
there
something
strange
about
you
Strider
bent
his
clear
bright
eyes
again
upon
the
Ranger
That
name
for
Man
that
you
give
And
strange
too
your
raiment
Have
you
sprung
out
the
grass
How
did
you
escape
our
sight
Are
you
elvish
folk
said
Aragorn
One
only
Elf
Legolas
from
the
Woodland
Realm
distant
Mirkwood
But
have
passed
through
Lothlórien
and
the
gifts
and
favour
the
Lady
with
The
Rider
looked
them
with
renewed
wonder
but
his
eyes
hardened
Then
there
Lady
the
Golden
Wood
old
tales
tell
said
Few
escape
her
nets
they
say
These
are
strange
days
But
you
have
her
favour
then
you
also
are
net
weavers
and
sorcerers
maybe
turned
cold
glance
suddenly
upon
Legolas
and
Gimli
Why
you
not
speak
silent
ones
demanded
Gimli
rose
and
planted
his
feet
firmly
apart
his
hand
gripped
the
handle
his
axe
and
his
dark
eyes
flashed
Give
your
name
horse
master
and
will
give
you
mine
and
more
besides
said
for
that
said
the
Rider
staring
down
the
Dwarf
the
stranger
should
declare
himself
first
Yet
named
Éomer
son
Éomund
and
called
the
Third
Marshal
Riddermark
Then
Éomer
son
Éomund
Third
Marshal
Riddermark
let
Gimli
the
Dwarf
Glóin
son
warn
you
against
foolish
words
You
speak
evil
that
which
fair
beyond
the
reach
your
thought
and
only
little
wit
can
excuse
you
Éomer
eyes
blazed
and
the
Men
Rohan
murmured
angrily
and
closed
advancing
their
spears
would
cut
off
your
head
beard
and
all
Master
Dwarf
stood
but
little
higher
from
the
ground
said
Éomer
stands
not
alone
said
Legolas
bending
his
bow
and
fitting
arrow
with
hands
that
moved
quicker
than
sight
You
would
die
before
your
stroke
fell
Éomer
raised
his
sword
and
things
might
have
gone
ill
but
Aragorn
sprang
between
them
and
raised
his
hand
Your
pardon
Éomer
cried
When
you
know
more
you
will
understand
why
you
have
angered
companions
intend
evil
Rohan
nor
any
its
folk
neither
man
nor
horse
Will
you
not
hear
our
tale
before
you
strike
will
said
Éomer
lowering
his
blade
But
wanderers
the
Riddermark
would
wise
less
haughty
these
days
doubt
First
tell
your
right
name
First
tell
whom
you
serve
said
Aragorn
Are
you
friend
foe
Sauron
the
Dark
Lord
Mordor
serve
only
the
Lord
the
Mark
Théoden
King
son
Thengel
answered
Éomer
not
serve
the
Power
the
Black
Land
far
away
but
neither
are
yet
open
war
with
him
and
you
are
fleeing
from
him
then
you
had
best
leave
this
land
There
trouble
now
all
our
borders
and
are
threatened
but
desire
only
free
and
live
have
lived
keeping
our
own
and
serving
foreign
lord
good
evil
welcomed
guests
kindly
the
better
days
but
these
times
the
unbidden
stranger
finds
swift
and
hard
Come
Who
are
you
Whom
_you_
serve
whose
command
you
hunt
Orcs
our
land
serve
man
said
Aragorn
but
the
servants
Sauron
pursue
into
whatever
land
they
may
There
are
few
among
mortal
Men
who
know
more
Orcs
and
not
hunt
them
this
fashion
out
choice
The
Orcs
whom

took
captive
two
friends
such
need
man
that

and
will
not
ask

follow
the
trail
Nor
will
count
the
heads
the
enemy
save
with
sword
not
weaponless
Aragorn
threw
back
his
cloak
The
elven
sheath
glittered
grasped
and
the
bright
blade
Andúril
shone
like
sudden
flame
swept
out
Elendil
cried
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
and
called
Elessar
the
Elfstone
Dúnadan

Isildur
Elendil

Gondor
Here
the
Sword
that
was
Broken
and
forged

Will
you

Choose
swiftly
Gimli
and
Legolas
looked
their
companion
amazement
for
they
had
not
seen
him
this
mood
before
seemed
have
grown
stature
while
Éomer
had
shrunk
and
his
living
face
they
caught
brief
vision
the
power
and
majesty
the
kings
stone
For
moment
seemed
the
eyes
Legolas
that
white
flame
flickered
the
brows
Aragorn
like
shining
crown
Éomer
stepped
back
and
look
awe
was
his
face
cast
down
his
proud
eyes
These
are
indeed
strange
days
muttered
Dreams
and
legends
spring
life
out
the
grass
Tell
lord
said
what
brings
you
here
And
what
was
the
meaning
the
dark
words
Long
has
Boromir
son
Denethor
been
gone
seeking
answer
and
the
horse
that
lent
him
came
back
riderless
What
doom
you
bring
out
the
North
The
doom
choice
said
Aragorn
You
may
say
this
Théoden
son
Thengel
open
war
lies
before
him
with
Sauron
against
him
None
may
live
now
they
have
lived
and
few
shall
keep
what
they
call
their
own
But
these
great
matters
will
speak
later
chance
allows
will
come
myself
the
king
Now
great
need
and
ask
for
help
least
for
tidings
You
heard
that
are
pursuing
orc
host
that
carried
off
our
friends
What
can
you
tell
That
you
need
not
pursue
them
further
said
Éomer
The
Orcs
are
destroyed
And
our
friends
found
none
but
Orcs
But
that
strange
indeed
said
Aragorn
Did
you
search
the
slain
Were
there
bodies
other
than
those
orc
kind
They
would
small
Only
children
your
eyes
unshod
but
clad
grey
There
were
dwarves
nor
children
said
Éomer
counted
all
the
slain
and
despoiled
them
and
then
piled
the
carcases
and
burned
them
our
custom
The
ashes
are
smoking
still
not
speak
dwarves
children
said
Gimli
Our
friends
were
hobbits
Hobbits
said
Éomer
And
what
may
they
strange
name
strange
name
for
strange
folk
said
Gimli
But
these
were
very
dear
seems
that
you
have
heard
Rohan
the
words
that
troubled
Minas
Tirith
They
spoke
the
Halfling
These
hobbits
are
Halflings
Halflings
laughed
the
Rider
that
stood
beside
Éomer
Halflings
But
they
are
only
little
people
old
songs
and
children
tales
out
the
North
walk
legends
the
green
earth
the
daylight
man
may
both
said
Aragorn
For
not
but
those
who
come
after
will
make
the
legends
our
time
The
green
earth
say
you
That
mighty
matter
legend
though
you
tread
under
the
light
day
Time
pressing
said
the
Rider
not
heeding
Aragorn
must
hasten
south
lord
Let
leave
these
wild
folk
their
fancies
let
bind
them
and
take
them
the
king
Peace
Éothain
said
Éomer
his
own
tongue
Leave
while
Tell
the
_éored_
assemble
the
path
and
make
ready
ride
the
Entwade
Muttering
Éothain
retired
and
spoke
the
others
Soon
they
drew
off
and
left
Éomer
alone
with
the
three
companions
All
that
you
say
strange
Aragorn
said
Yet
you
speak
the
truth
that
plain
the
Men
the
Mark
not
lie
and
therefore
they
are
not
easily
deceived
But
you
have
not
told
all
Will
you
not
now
speak
more
fully
your
errand
that
may
judge
what
set
out
from
Imladris
named
the
rhyme
many
weeks
ago
answered
Aragorn
With
went
Boromir
Minas
Tirith
errand
was
that
city
with
the
son
Denethor
aid
his
folk
their
war
against
Sauron
But
the
Company
that
journeyed
with
had
other
business
that
cannot
speak
now
Gandalf
the
Grey
was
our
leader
Gandalf
Éomer
exclaimed
Gandalf
Greyhame
known
the
Mark
but
his
name
warn
you
longer
password
the
king
favour
has
been
guest
the
land
many
times
the
memory
men
coming
will
after
season
after
many
years
ever
the
herald
strange
events
bringer
evil
some
now
say
Indeed
since
his
last
coming
the
summer
all
things
have
gone
amiss
that
time
our
trouble
with
Saruman
began
Until
then
counted
Saruman
our
friend
hut
Gandalf
came
then
and
warned
that
sudden
war
was
preparing
Isengard
said
that
himself
had
been
prisoner
Orthanc
and
had
hardly
escaped
and
begged
for
help
But
Théoden
would
not
listen
him
and
went
away
Speak
not
the
name
Gandalf
loudly
Théoden
ears
wroth
For
Gandalf
took
the
horse
that
called
Shadowfax
the
most
precious
all
the
king
steeds
chief
the
_Mearas_
which
only
the
Lord
the
Mark
may
ride
For
the
sire
their
race
was
the
great
horse
Eorl
that
knew
the
speech
Men
Seven
nights
ago
Shadowfax
returned
but
the
king
anger
not
less
for
now
the
horse
wild
and
will
let
man
handle
him
Then
Shadowfax
has
found
his
way
alone
from
the
far
North
said
Aragorn
for
was
there
that
and
Gandalf
parted
But
alas
Gandalf
will
ride
longer
fell
into
darkness
the
Mines
Moria
and
comes
not
again
That
heavy
tidings
said
Éomer
least
and
many
though
not
all
you
may
find
you
come
the
king
tidings
more
grievous
than
any
this
land
can
understand
though
may
touch
them
sorely
ere
the
year
much
older
said
Aragorn
But
when
the
great
fall
the
less
must
lead
part
has
been
guide
our
Company
the
long
road
from
Moria
Through
Lórien
came
which
were
well
that
you
should
learn
the
truth
ere
you
speak
again
and
thence
down
the
leagues
the
Great
River
the
falls
Rauros
There
Boromir
was
slain
the
same
Orcs
whom
you
destroyed
Your
news
all
woe
cried
Éomer
dismay
Great
harm
this
death
Minas
Tirith
and
all
That
was
worthy
man
All
spoke
his
praise
came
seldom
the
Mark
for
was
ever
the
wars
the
East
borders
but
have
seen
him
More
like
the
swift
sons
Eorl
than
the
grave
Men
Gondor
seemed
and
likely
prove
great
captain
his
people
when
his
time
came
But
have
had
word
this
grief
out
Gondor
When
did
fall
now
the
fourth
day
since
was
slain
answered
Aragorn
and
since
the
evening
that
day
have
journeyed
from
the
shadow
Tol
Brandir
foot
cried
Éomer
Yes
even
you
see
Wide
wonder
came
into
Éomer
eyes
Strider
too
poor
name
son
Arathorn
said
Wingfoot
name
you
This
deed
the
three
friends
should
sung
many
hall
Forty
leagues
and
five
you
have
measured
ere
the
fourth
day
ended
Hardy
the
race
Elendil
But
now
lord
what
would
you
have
must
return
haste
Théoden
spoke
warily
before
men
true
that
are
not
yet
open
war
with
the
Black
Land
and
there
are
some
close
the
king
ear
that
speak
craven
counsels
but
war
coming
shall
not
forsake
our
old
alliance
with
Gondor
and
while
they
fight
shall
aid
them
say
and
all
who
hold
with
The
East
mark
charge
the
ward
the
Third
Marshal
and
have
removed
all
our
herds
and
herdfolk
withdrawing
them
beyond
Entwash
and
leaving
none
here
but
guards
and
swift
scouts
Then
you
not
pay
tribute
Sauron
said
Gimli
not
and
never
have
said
Éomer
with
flash
his
eyes
though
comes
ears
that
that
lie
has
been
told
Some
years
ago
the
Lord
the
Black
Land
wished
purchase
horses
great
price
but
refused
him
for
puts
beasts
evil
use
Then
sent
plundering
Orcs
and
they
carry
off
what
they
can
choosing
always
the
black
horses
few
these
are
now
left
For
that
reason
our
feud
with
the
Orcs
bitter
But
this
time
our
chief
concern
with
Saruman
has
claimed
lordship
over
all
this
land
and
there
has
been
war
between
for
many
months
has
taken
Orcs
into
his
service
and
Wolf
riders
and
evil
Men
and
has
closed
the
Gap
against
that
are
likely
beset
both
east
and
west
ill
dealing
with
such
foe
wizard
both
cunning
and
dwimmer
crafty
having
many
guises
walks
here
and
there
they
say
old
man
hooded
and
cloaked
very
like
Gandalf

now
recall
His
spies
slip
through
every
net
and
his
birds
ill
omen
are
abroad
the
sky
not
know
how
will
all
end
and
heart
misgives
for
seems
that
his
friends
not
all
dwell
Isengard
But
you
come
the
king
house
you
shall
see
for
yourself
Will
you
not
come
hope
vain
that
you
have
been
sent
for
help
doubt
and
need
will
come
when
may
said
Aragorn
Come
now
said
Éomer
The
Heir
Elendil

the
Sons

evil
tide
There

upon

Indeed
this
riding
north
went
without
the
king
leave
for
absence
his
house
left
with
little
guard
But
scouts
warned
the
orc
host
coming
down
out
the
East
Wall
three
nights
ago
and
among
them
they
reported
that
some
bore

between
Orthanc
and
the
Dark
Tower
led

own

and
overtook
the
Orcs
nightfall
two
days
ago
near
the
borders
the
Entwood
There
surrounded
them
and
gave
battle
yesterday
dawn
Fifteen
men
lost
and
twelve
horses
alas
For
the
Orcs
were
greater
number
than
counted
Others
joined
them
coming
out
the
East
across
the
Great
River
their
trail
plain
see
little
north
this
spot
And
others
too
came
out
the
forest
Great
Orcs
who
also
bore
the
White
Hand
Isengard
that
kind
stronger
and
more
fell
than
all
others
Nonetheless
put

them
But
have
been
too
long
away

south
and

Will
you
not

There
are
spare

There

Yes

and

and
would
gladly
learn
better
thank
you
for
your
fair
words
said
Aragorn
and
heart
desires
come
with
you
but
cannot
desert
friends
while
hope
remains
Hope
does
not
remain
said
Éomer
You
will
not
find
your
friends
the
North
borders
Yet
friends
are
not
behind
found
clear
token
not
far
from
the
East
Wall
that
one
least
them
was
still
alive
there
But
between
the
wall
and
the
downs
have
found
other
trace
them
and
trail
has
turned
aside
this
way
that
unless
skill
has
wholly
left
Then
what
you
think
has
become
them
not
know
They
may
have
been
slain
and
burned
among
the
Orcs
but
that
you
will
say
cannot
and
not
fear
can
only
think
that
they
were
carried
off
into
the
forest
before
the
battle
even
before
you
encircled
your
foes
maybe
Can
you
swear
that
none
escaped
your
net
such
way
would
swear
that
Orc
escaped
after
sighted
them
said
Éomer
reached
the
forest
eaves
before
them
and
after
that
any
living
thing
broke
through
our
ring
then
was
Orc
and
had
some
elvish
power
Our
friends
were
attired
even
are
said
Aragorn
and
you
passed
under
the
full
light
day
had
forgotten
that
said
Éomer
hard
sure
anything
among
many
marvels
The
world
all
grown
strange
Elf
and
Dwarf
company
walk
our
daily
fields
and
folk
speak
with
the
Lady
the
Wood
and
yet
live
and
the
Sword
comes
back
war
that
was
broken
the
long
ages
ere
the
fathers
our
fathers
rode
into
the
Mark
How
shall
man
judge
what
such
times
ever
has
judged
said
Aragorn
Good
and
ill
have
not
changed
since
yesteryear
nor
are
they
one
thing
among
Elves
and
Dwarves
and
another
among
Men
man

discern
them
much
the
Golden
Wood
his
own
house
True
indeed
said
Éomer
But
not
doubt
you
nor
the
deed
which
heart
would
Yet
not
free
all
would
against
our
law
let
strangers
wander
will
our
land
until
the
king
himself
shall
give
them
leave
and
more
strict
the
command
these
days
peril
have
begged
you
come
back
willingly
with
and
you
will
not
Loth
begin
battle
one
hundred
against
three
not
think
your
law
was
made
for
such
chance
said
Aragorn
Nor
indeed
stranger
for
have
been
this
land
before
more
than
once
and
ridden
with
the
host
the
Rohirrim
though
under
other
name
and
other
guise
You
have
not
seen
before
for
you
are
young
but
have
spoken
with
Éomund
your
father
and
with
Théoden
son
Thengel
Never
former
days
would
any
high
lord
this
land
have
constrained
man
abandon
such
quest
mine
duty
least
clear
Come
now
son
Éomund
the
choice
must
made
last
Aid
the
worst
let
free
seek
carry
out
your
law
you
there
will
fewer
return
your
war
your

Éomer
was
silent
for
moment
then
spoke
both

need

said
company
chafes
away
and
every
hour
lessens
your
hope
This
choice
You
may
and
what
more
will
lend
you
horses
This
only
ask
when
your
quest
achieved
proved
vain
return
with
the
horses
over
the
Entwade
Meduseld
the
high
house
Edoras
where
Théoden
now
sits
Thus
you
shall
prove
him
that
have
not
misjudged
this
place
myself
and
maybe
very
life
the
keeping
your
good
faith
not
fail
will
not
said
Aragorn
There
was
great
wonder
and
many
dark
and
doubtful
glances
among
his
men
when
Éomer
gave
orders
that
the
spare
horses
were
lent
the
strangers
but
only
Éothain
dared
speak
openly
may
well
enough
for
this
lord
the
race
Gondor
claims
said
but
who
has
heard
horse
the
Mark
being
given
Dwarf
one
said
Gimli
And
not
trouble
one
will
ever
hear
would
sooner
walk
than
sit
the
back
any
beast
great
free
begrudged
But
you
must
ride
now
you
will
hinder
said
Aragorn
Come
you
shall
sit
behind
friend
Gimli
said
Legolas
Then
all
will
well
and
you
need
neither
borrow
horse
nor
troubled
one
great
dark
grey
horse
was
brought
Aragorn
and
mounted
Hasufel
his
name
said
Éomer
May
bear
you
well
and
better
fortune
than
Gárulf
his
late
master
smaller
and
lighter
horse
but
restive
and
fiery
was
brought
Legolas
Arod
was
his
name
But
Legolas
asked
them
take
off
saddle
and
rein
need
them
not
said
and
leaped
lightly
and
their
wonder
Arod
was
tame
and
willing
beneath
him
moving
here
and
there
with
but
spoken
word
such
was
the
elvish
way
with
all
good
beasts
Gimli
was
lifted
behind
his
friend
and
clung
him
not
much
more
ease
than
Sam
Gamgee
boat
Farewell
and
may
you
find
what
you
seek
cried
Éomer
Return
with
what
speed
you
may
and
let
our
swords
hereafter
shine
together
will
come
said
Aragorn
And
will
come
too
said
Gimli
The
matter
the
Lady
Galadriel
lies
still
between
have
yet
teach
you
gentle
speech
shall
see
said
Éomer
many
strange
things
have
chanced
that
learn
the
praise
fair
lady
under
the
loving
strokes
Dwarf
axe
will
seem
great
wonder
Farewell
With
that
they
parted
Very
swift
were
the
horses
Rohan
When
after
little
Gimli
looked
back
the
company
Éomer
were
already
small
and
far
away
Aragorn
did
not
look
back
was
watching
the
trail
they
sped
their
way
bending
low
with
his
head
beside
the
neck
Hasufel
Before
long
they
came
the
borders
the
Entwash
and
there
they
met
the
other
trail
which
Éomer
had
spoken
coming
down
from
the
East
out
the
Wold
Aragorn
dismounted
and
surveyed
the
ground
then
leaping
back
into
the
saddle
rode
away
for
some
distance
eastward
keeping
one
side
and
taking
care
not
override
the
footprints
Then
again
dismounted
and
examined
the
ground
going
backwards
and
forwards
foot
There
little
discover
said
when
returned
The
main
trail
all
confused
with
the
passage
the
horsemen
they
came
back
their
outward
course
must
have
lain
nearer
the
river
But
this
eastward
trail
fresh
and
clear
There
sign
there
any
feet
going
the
other
way
back
towards
Anduin
Now
must
ride
slower
and
make
sure
that
trace
footstep
branches
off
either
side
The
Orcs
must
have
been
aware
from
this
point
that
they
were
pursued
they
may
have
made
some
attempt
get
their
captives
away
before
they
were
overtaken
they
rode
forward
the
day
was
overcast
Low
grey
clouds
came
over
the
Wold
mist
shrouded
the
sun
Ever
nearer
the
tree
clad
slopes
Fangorn
loomed
slowly
darkling
the
sun
went
west
They
saw
sign
any
trail
right
left
but
here
and
there
they
passed
single
Orcs
fallen
their
tracks
they
ran
with
grey
feathered
arrows
sticking
back
throat
last
the
afternoon
was
waning
they
came
the
eaves
the
forest
and
open
glade
among
the
first
trees
they
found
the
place
the
great
burning
the
ashes
were
still
hot
and
smoking
Beside
was
great
pile
helms
and
mail
cloven
shields
and
broken
swords
bows
and
darts
and
other
gear
war
Upon
stake
the
middle
was
set
great
goblin
head
upon
its
shattered
helm
the
white
badge
could
still
seen
Further
away
not
far
from
the
river
where
came
streaming
out
from
the
edge
the
wood
there
was
mound
was
newly
raised
the
raw
earth
was
covered
with
fresh
cut
turves
about
were
planted
fifteen
spears
Aragorn
and
his
companions
searched
far
and
wide
about
the
field
battle
but
the
light
faded
and
evening
soon
drew
down
dim
and
misty
nightfall
they
had
discovered
trace
Merry
and
Pippin
can
more
said
Gimli
sadly
have
been
set
many
riddles
since
came
Tol
Brandir
but
this
the
hardest
unravel
would
guess
that
the
burned
bones
the
hobbits
are
now
mingled
with
the
Orcs
will
hard
news
for
Frodo
lives
hear
and
hard
too
for
the
old
hobbit
who
waits
Rivendell
Elrond
was
against
their
coming
But
Gandalf
was
not
said
Legolas
But
Gandalf
chose
come
himself
and
was
the
first
lost
answered
Gimli
His
foresight
failed
him
The
counsel
Gandalf
was
not
founded
foreknowledge
safety
for
himself
for
others
said
Aragorn
There
are
some
things
that
better
begin
than
refuse
even
though
the
end
may
dark
But
shall
not
depart
from
this
place
yet
any
case
must
here
await
the
morning
light
little
way
beyond
the
battle
field
they
made
their
camp
under
spreading
tree
looked
like
chestnut
and
yet
still
bore
many
broad
brown
leaves
former
year
like
dry
hands
with
long
splayed
fingers
they
rattled
mournfully
the
night
breeze
Gimli
shivered
They
had
brought
only
one
blanket
apiece
Let
light
fire
said
care
longer
for
the
danger
Let
the
Orcs
come
thick
summer
moths
round
candle
those
unhappy
hobbits
are
astray
the
woods
might
draw
them
hither
said
Legolas
And
might
draw
other
things
neither
Orc
nor
Hobbit
said
Aragorn
are
near
the
mountain
marches
the
traitor
Saruman
Also
are
the
very
edge
Fangorn
and
perilous
touch
the
trees
that
wood
said
But
the
Rohirrim
made
great
burning
here
yesterday
said
Gimli
and
they
felled
trees
for
the
fire
can
seen
Yet
they
passed
the
night
after
safely
here
when
their
labour
was
ended
They
were
many
said
Aragorn
and
they
not
heed
the
wrath
Fangorn
for
they
come
here
seldom
and
they
not
under
the
trees
But
our
paths
are
likely
lead
into
the
very
forest
itself
have
care
Cut
living
wood
There
need
said
Gimli
The
Riders
have
left
chip
and
bough
enough
and
there
dead
wood
lying
plenty
went
off
gather
fuel
and
busied
himself
with
building
and
kindling
fire
but
Aragorn
sat
silent
with
his
back
the
great
tree
deep
thought
and
Legolas
stood
alone
the
open
looking
towards
the
profound
shadow
the
wood
leaning
forward
one
who
listens
voices
calling
from
distance
When
the
Dwarf
had
small
bright
blaze
going
the
three
companions
drew
close
and
sat
together
shrouding
the
light
with
their
hooded
forms
Legolas
looked
the
boughs
the
tree
reaching
out
above
them
Look
said
The
tree
glad
the
fire
may
have
been
that
the
dancing
shadows
tricked
their
eyes
but
certainly
each
the
companions
the
boughs
appeared
bending
this
way
and
that
come
above
the
flames
while
the
upper
branches
were
stooping
down
the
brown
leaves
now
stood
out
stiff
and
rubbed
together
like
many
cold
cracked
hands
taking
comfort
the
warmth
There
was
silence
for
suddenly
the
dark
and
unknown
forest
near
hand
made
itself
felt
great
brooding
presence
full
secret
purpose
After
while
Legolas
spoke
again
Celeborn
warned
not
far
into
Fangorn
said
you
know
why
Aragorn
What
are
the
fables
the
forest
that
Boromir
had
heard
have
heard
many
tales
Gondor
and
elsewhere
said
Aragorn
but
were
not
for
the
words
Celeborn
should
deem
them
only
fables
that
Men
have
made
true
knowledge
fades
had
thought
asking
you
what
was
the
truth
the
matter
And
Elf
the
Wood
does
not
know
how
shall
Man
answer
You
have
journeyed
further
than
said
Legolas
have
heard
nothing
this
own
land
save
only
songs
that
tell
how
the
Onodrim
that
Men
call
Ents
dwelt
there
long
ago
for
Fangorn
old
old
even
the
Elves
would
reckon
Yes
old
said
Aragorn
old
the
forest
the
Barrow
downs
and
far
greater
Elrond
says
that
the
two
are
akin
the
last
strongholds
the
mighty
woods
the
Elder
Days
which
the
Firstborn
roamed
while
Men
still
slept
Yet
Fangorn
holds
some
secret
its
own
What
not
know
And
not
wish
know
said
Gimli
Let
nothing
that
dwells
Fangorn
troubled
account
They
now
drew
lots
for
the
watches
and
the
lot
for
the
first
watch
fell
Gimli
The
others
lay
down
Almost
once
sleep
laid
hold
them
Gimli
said
Aragorn
drowsily
Remember
perilous
cut
bough
twig
from
living
tree
Fangorn
But
not
stray
far
search
dead
wood
Let
the
fire
die
rather
Call
need
With
that
fell
asleep
Legolas
already
lay
motionless
his
fair
hands
folded
upon
his
breast
his
eyes
unclosed
blending
living
night
and
deep
dream
the
way
with
Elves
Gimli
sat
hunched
the
fire
running
his
thumb
thoughtfully
along
the
edge
his
axe
The
tree
rustled
There
was
other
sound
Suddenly
Gimli
looked
and
there
just
the
edge
the
fire
light
stood
old
bent
man
leaning
staff
and
wrapped
great
cloak
his
wide
brimmed
hat
was
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
Gimli
sprang
too
amazed
for
the
moment
cry
out
though
once
the
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
that
Saruman
had
caught
them
Both
Aragorn
and
Legolas
roused
his
sudden
movement
sat
and
stared
The
old
man
did
not
speak
make
sign
Well
father
what
can
for
you
said
Aragorn
leaping
his
feet
Come
and
warm
you
are
cold
strode
forward
but
the
old
man
was
gone
There
was
trace
him
found
near
hand
and
they
did
not
dare
wander
far
The
moon
had
set
and
the
night
was
very
dark
Suddenly
Legolas
gave
cry
The
horses
The
horses
The
horses
were
gone
They
had
dragged
their
pickets
and
disappeared
For
time
the
three
companions
stood
still
and
silent
troubled
this
new
stroke
ill
fortune
They
were
under
the
eaves
Fangorn
and
endless
leagues
lay
between
them
and
the
Men
Rohan
their
only
friends
this
wide
and
dangerous
land
they
stood
seemed
them
that
they
heard
far
off
the
night
the
sound
horses
whinnying
and
neighing
Then
all
was
quiet
again
except
for
the
cold
rustle
the
wind
Well
they
are
gone
said
Aragorn
last
cannot
find
them
catch
them
that
they
not
return
their
own
will
must
without
started
our
feet
and
have
those
still
Feet
said
Gimli
But
cannot
eat
them
well
walk
them
threw
some
fuel
the
fire
and
slumped
down
beside
Only
few
hours
ago
you
were
unwilling
sit
horse
Rohan
laughed
Legolas
You
will
make
rider
yet
seems
unlikely
that
shall
have
the
chance
said
Gimli
you
wish
know
what
think
began
again
after
while
think
was
Saruman
Who
else
Remember
the
words
Éomer
walks
about
like
old
man
hooded
and
cloaked
Those
were
the
words
has
gone
off
with
our
horses
scared
them
away
and
here
are
There
more
trouble
coming
mark
words
mark
them
said
Aragorn
But
marked
also
that
this
old
man
had
hat
not
hood
Still
not
doubt
that
you
guess
right
and
that
are
peril
here
night
day
Yet
the
meantime
there
nothing
that
can
but
rest
while
may
will
watch
for
while
now
Gimli
have
more
need
thought
than
sleep
The
night
passed
slowly
Legolas
followed
Aragorn
and
Gimli
followed
Legolas
and
their
watches
wore
away
But
nothing
happened
The
old
man
did
not
appear
again
and
the
horses
did
not
return
_Chapter
The
Uruk
Hai
Pippin
lay
dark
and
troubled
dream
seemed
that
could
hear
his
own
small
voice
echoing
black
tunnels
calling
_Frodo
Frodo
But
instead
Frodo
hundreds
hideous
orc
faces
grinned
him
out
the
shadows
hundreds
hideous
arms
grasped
him
from
every
side
Where
was
Merry
woke
Cold
air
blew
his
face
was
lying
his
back
Evening
was
coming
and
the
sky
above
was
growing
dim
turned
and
found
that
the
dream
was
little
worse
than
the
waking
His
wrists
legs
and
ankles
were
tied
with
cords
Beside
him
Merry
lay
white
faced
with
dirty
rag
bound
across
his
brows
All
about
them
sat
stood
great
company
Orcs
Slowly
Pippin
aching
head
memory
pieced
itself
together
and
became
separated
from
dream
shadows
course
and
Merry
had
run
off
into
the
woods
What
had
come
over
them
Why
had
they
dashed
off
like
that
taking
notice
old
Strider
They
had
run
long
way
shouting
could
not
remember
how
far
how
long
and
then
suddenly
they
had
crashed
right
into
group
Orcs
they
were
standing
listening
and
they
did
not
appear
see
Merry
and
Pippin
until
they
were
almost
their
arms
Then
they
yelled
and
dozens
other
goblins
had
sprung
out
the
trees
Merry
and
had
drawn
their
swords
but
the
Orcs
did
not
wish
fight
and
had
tried
only
lay
hold
them
even
when
Merry
had
cut
off
several
their
arms
and
hands
Good
old
Merry
Then
Boromir
had
come
leaping
through
the
trees
had
made
them
fight
slew
many
them
and
the
rest
fled
But
they
had
not
gone
far
the
way
back
when
they
were
attacked
again
hundred
Orcs
least
some
them
very
large
and
they
shot
rain
arrows
always
Boromir
Boromir
had
blown
his
great
horn
till
the
woods
rang
and
first
the
Orcs
had
been
dismayed
and
had
drawn
back
but
when
answer
but
the
echoes
came
they
had
attacked
more
fierce
than
ever
Pippin
did
not
remember
much
more
His
last
memo
was
Boromir
leaning
against
tree
plucking
out
arrow
then
darkness
fell
suddenly
suppose
was
knocked
the
head
said
himself
wonder
poor
Merry
much
hurt
What
has
happened
Boromir
Why
didn
the
Orcs
kill
Where
are
and
where
are
going
could
not
answer
the
questions
felt
cold
and
sick
wish
Gandalf
had
never
persuaded
Elrond
let
come
thought
What
good
have
been
Just
nuisance
passenger
piece

And
now
have
been
stolen
and
just
piece
luggage
for
the
Orcs
hope
Strider
someone
will
come
and
claim
But
ought
hope
for
Won
that
throw
out
all
the
plans
wish
could
get
free
struggled
little
quite
uselessly
One
the
Orcs
sitting
near
laughed
and
said
something
companion
their
abominable
tongue
Rest
while
you
can
little
fool
said
then
Pippin
the
Common
Speech
which
made
almost
hideous
his
own
language
Rest
while
you
can
find
use
for
your
legs
before
long
You
wish
you
had
got
none
before

said
the
other
make

squeak
you
miserable
rat
stooped
over
Pippin
bringing
his
yellow
fangs
close
his
face
had
black
knife
with
long
jagged
blade
his
hand
Lie

_Uglúk

skai
passed
into
long
angry
speech
his
own
tongue
that
slowly
died
away
into
muttering
and
snarling
Terrified
Pippin
lay
still
though
the
pain
his
wrists
and
ankles
was
growing
and
the
stones
beneath
him
were
boring
into
his
back
take
his
mind
off
himself
listened
intently
all
that
could
hear
There
were
many
voices
round
about
and
though
orc
speech
sounded
all
times
full
hate
and
anger
seemed
plain
that
something
like
quarrel
had
begun
and
was
getting
hotter
Pippin
surprise
found
that
much
the
talk
was
intelligible
many
the
Orcs
were
using
ordinary
language
Apparently
the
members
two
three
quite
different
tribes
were
present
and
they
could
not
understand
one
another
orc
speech
There
was
angry
debate
concerning
what
they
were
now
which
way
they
were
take
and
what
should
done
with
the
prisoners
There
time
kill
them
properly
said
one
time
for
play
this
trip
That
can
helped
said
another
But
why
not
kill
them
quick
kill
them
now
They
cursed
nuisance
and
hurry
Evening
coming
and
ought
get
move
Orders
said
third
voice
deep
growl
Kill
all
but_NOT_
the
Halfings
they
are
brought
back_ALIVE_
quickly

That
orders
What
are
they
wanted
for
asked
several
voices
Why
alive
they
give
good
sport
heard
that
one
them
has
got
something
something
that
wanted
for
the
War
some
elvish
plot
other
Anyway
they
both
questioned
that
all
you
know
Why
don
search
them
and
find
out
might
find
something
that
could
use
ourselves
That
very
interesting
remark
sneered
voice
softer
than
the
others
but
more
evil
may
have
report
that
The
prisoners
are
NOT
searched
plundered
those
are
_my_
orders
And
mine
too
said
the
deep
voice
_Alive
and
captured

That
orders
Not
our
orders
said
one
the
earlier
voices
have
come
all
the
way
from
the
Mines
kill
and
avenge
our
folk
wish
kill
and
then
back
north
Then
you
can
wish

said
the
growling
voice
Uglúk

return
Isengard
the
shortest
road
Saruman
the
master
the
Great
Eye
said
the
evil
voice

back
once
Lugbúrz
could
cross
the
Great
River

said
another
voice
But
there
are
not
enough
venture
down
the
bridges
came
across
said
the
evil
voice
winged
Nazgûl
awaits
northward
the

bank
Maybe
maybe
Then
you
fly
off
with
our
prisoners
and
get
all
the
pay
and
praise
Lugbúrz
and
leave
foot
best
can
through
the
Horse
country
must
stick
together
These
lands
are
dangerous
full
foul
rebels
and
brigands
Aye
must
stick

growled
Uglúk
don
trust
you
little
swine
You
guts
outside
your
own
sties
But
for
you
all
have
run
away
are

Saruman

Wise

the

out
Isengard
and
led
you
here
and
shall
lead
you
back
the
way
choose
Uglúk
have
spoken
You
have
spoken
more
than
enough
Uglúk
sneered
the
evil
voice
wonder
how
they
would
like
Lugbúrz
They
might
think
that
Uglúk
shoulders
needed
relieving
swollen
head
They
might
ask
where
his
strange
ideas
came
from
Did
they
come
from
Saruman
perhaps
Who
does
_he_
think
setting
his
own
with
his
filthy
white
badges
They
might
agree
with
with
Grishnákh
their
trusted
messenger
and
Grishnákh
say
this
Saruman
fool
and
dirty
treacherous
fool
But
the
Great
Eye
him
_Swine_
How
you
folk
like
being
called
_swine_
the
muck
rakers
dirty
little
wizard
orc
flesh
they
eat
warrant
Many
loud
yells
orc
speech
answered
him
and
the
ringing
clash
weapons
being
drawn
Cautiously
Pippin
rolled
over
hoping
see
what
would
happen
His
guards
had
gone
join
the
fray
the
twilight
saw
large
black
Orc
probably
Uglúk
standing
facing
Grishnákh
short
crook
legged
creature
very
broad
and
with
long
arms
that
hung
almost
the
ground
Round
them
were
many
smaller
goblins
Pippin
supposed
that
these
were
the
ones
from
the
North
They
had
drawn
their
knives
and
swords
but
hesitated
attack
Uglúk
Uglúk
shouted
and
number
other
Orcs
nearly
his
own
size
ran
Then
suddenly
without
warning
Uglúk
sprang
forwards
and
with
two
swift
strokes
swept
the
heads
off
two
his
opponents
Grishnákh
stepped
aside
and
vanished
into
the
shadows
The
others
gave
way
and
one
stepped
backwards
and
fell
over
Merry
prostrate
form
with
curse
Yet
that
probably
saved
his
life
for
Uglúk
followers
leaped
over
him
and
cut
down
another
with
their
broad
bladed
swords
was
the
yellow
fanged
guard
His
body
fell
right
top
Pippin
still
clutching
its
long
saw
edged
knife
Put
your
weapons
shouted
Uglúk
And
let
have
more
nonsense
straight
west
from
here
and
down
the
stair
From
there
straight
the
downs
then
along
the
river
the
forest
And
march
day
and
night
That
clear
Now
thought
Pippin
only
takes
that
ugly
fellow
little
while
get
his
troop
under
control
got
chance
gleam
hope
had
come
him
The
edge
the
black
knife
had
snicked
his
arm
and
then
slid
down
his
wrist
felt
the
blood
trickling
his
hand
but
also
felt
the
cold
touch
steel
against
his
skin
The
Orcs
were
getting
ready
march
again
but
some
the
Northerners
were
still
unwilling
and
the
Isengarders
slew
two
more
before
the
rest
were
cowed
There
was
much
cursing
and
confusion
For
the
moment
Pippin
was
unwatched
His
legs
were
securely
bound
but
his
arms
were
only
tied
about
the
wrists
and
his
hands
were
front
him
could
move
them
both
together
though
the
bonds
were
cruelly
tight
pushed
the
dead
Orc
one
side
then
hardly
daring
breathe
drew
the
knot
the
wrist
cord
and
down
against
the
blade
the
knife
was
sharp
and
the
dead
hand
held
fast
The
cord
was
cut
Quickly
Pippin
took
his
fingers
and
knotted
again
into
loose
bracelet
two
loops
and
slipped
over
his
hands
Then
lay
very
still
Pick
those
prisoners
shouted
Uglúk
Don
play
any
tricks
with
them
they
are
not
alive
when
get
back
someone
else
will
die
too
Orc
seized
Pippin
like
sack
put
its
head
between
his
tied
hands
grabbed
his
arms
and
dragged
them
down
until
Pippin
face
was
crushed
against
its
neck
then
jolted
off
with
him
Another
treated
Merry
the
same
way
The
Orc
clawlike
hand
gripped
Pippin
arms
like
iron
the
nails
bit
into
him
shut
his
eyes
and
slipped
back
into
evil
dreams
Suddenly
was
thrown
the
stony
floor
again
was
early
night
but
the
slim
moon
was
already
falling
westward
They
were
the
edge
cliff
that
seemed
look
out
over
sea
pale
mist
There
was
sound
water
falling
nearby
The
scouts
have
come
back
last
said
Orc
close
hand
Well
what
did
you
discover
growled
the
voice
Uglúk
Only
single
horseman
and
made
off
westwards
All
clear
now
Now
daresay
But
how
long
You
fools
You
should
have
shot
him
raise
the
alarm
The
cursed
horsebreeders
will
hear
morning
Now
have
leg
double
quick
shadow
bent
over
Pippin
was
Uglúk
Sit
said
the
Orc
lads
are
tired
lugging
you
about
have
got
climb
down
and
you
must
use
your
legs
helpful
now
crying
out
trying
escape
have
ways
paying
for
tricks
that
you
won
like
though
they
won
spoil
your
usefulness
for
the
Master
cut
the
thongs
round
Pippin
legs
and
ankles
picked
him
his
hair
and
stood
him
his
feet
Pippin
fell
down
and
Uglúk
dragged
him
his
hair
again
Several
Orcs
laughed
Uglúk
thrust
flask
between
his
teeth
and
poured
some
burning
liquid
down
his
throat
felt
hot
fierce
glow
flow
through
him
The
pain
his
legs
and
ankles
vanished
could
stand
Now
for
the
other
said
Uglúk
Pippin
saw
him
Merry
who
was
lying
close
and
kick
him
Merry
groaned
Seizing
him
roughly
Uglúk
pulled
him
into
sitting
position
and
tore
the
bandage
off
his
head
Then
smeared
the
wound
with
some
dark
stuff
out
small
wooden
box
Merry
cried
out
and
struggled
wildly
The
Orcs
clapped
and
hooted
Can
take
his
medicine
they
jeered
Doesn
know
what
good
for
him
shall
have
some
fun
later
But
the
moment
Uglúk
was
not
engaged
sport
needed
speed
and
had
humour
unwilling
followers
was
healing
Merry
orc
fashion
and
his
treatment
worked
swiftly
When
had
forced
drink
from
his
flask
down
the
hobbit
throat
cut
his
leg
bonds
and
dragged
him
his
feet
Merry
stood
looking
pale
but
grim
and
defiant
and
very
much
alive
The
gash
his
forehead
gave
him
more
trouble
but
bore
brown
scar
the
end
his
days
Hullo
Pippin
said
you
come
this
little
expedition
too
Where
get
bed
and
breakfast
Now
then
said
Uglúk
None
that
Hold
your
tongues
talk
one
another
Any
trouble
will
reported
the
other
end
and
know
how
pay
you
You
get
bed
and
breakfast
all
right
more
than
you
can
stomach
The
orc
band
began
descend
narrow
ravine
leading
down
into
the
misty
plain
below
Merry
and
Pippin
separated
dozen
Orcs
more
climbed
down
with
them
the
bottom
they
stepped
grass
and
the
hearts
the
hobbits
rose
Now
straight
shouted
Uglúk
West
and
little
north
Follow
Lugdush
But
what
are
going
sunrise
said
some
the
Northerners
running
said
Uglúk
What
you
think
Sit
the
grass
and
wait
for
the
Whiteskins
join
the
picnic
But
can
run
the
sunlight
You
run
with
behind
you
said
Uglúk
Run
you
never
see
your
beloved
holes
again
the
White
Hand
What
the
use
sending
out
mountain
maggots
trip
only
half
trained
Run
curse
you
Run
while
night
lasts
Then
the
whole
company
began
run
with
the
long
loping
strides
Orcs
They
kept
order
thrusting
jostling
and
cursing
yet
their
speed
was
very
great
Each
hobbit
had
guard
three
Pippin
was
far
back
the
line
wondered
how
long
would
able
this
pace
had
had
food
since
the
morning
One
his
guards
had
whip
But
present
the
orc
liquor
was
still
hot
him
His
wits
too
were
wide
awake
Every
now
and
again
there
came
into
his
mind
unbidden
vision
the
keen
face
Strider
bending
over
dark
trail
and
running
running
behind
But
what
could
even
Ranger
see
except
confused
trail
orc
feet
His
own
little
prints
and
Merry
were
overwhelmed
the
trampling
the
iron
shod
shoes
before
them
and
behind
them
and
about
them
They
had
gone
only
mile
from
the
cliff
when
the
land
sloped
down
into
wide
shallow
depression
where
the
ground
was
soft
and
wet
Mist
lay
there
pale
glimmering
the
last
rays
the
sickle
moon
The
dark
shapes
the
Orcs
front
grew
dim
and
then
were
swallowed
Steady
now
shouted
Uglúk
from
the
rear
sudden
thought
leaped
into
Pippin
mind
and
acted
once
swerved
aside
the
right
and
dived
out
the
reach
his
clutching
guard
headfirst
into
the
mist
landed
sprawling
the
grass
Halt
yelled
Uglúk
There
was
for
moment
turmoil
and
confusion
Pippin
sprang
and
ran
But
the
Orcs
were
after
him
Some
suddenly
loomed
right
front
him
hope
escape
thought
Pippin
But
there
hope
that
have
left
some
own
marks
unspoilt
the
wet
ground
groped
with
his
two
tied
hands
his
throat
and
unclasped
the
brooch
his
cloak
Just
long
arms
and
hard
claws
seized
him
let
fall
There
suppose
will
lie
until
the
end
time
thought
don
know
why
did
the
others
have
escaped
they
probably
all
gone
with
Frodo
whip
thong
curled
round
his
legs
and
stifled
cry
Enough
shouted
Uglúk
running
still
got
run
long
way
yet
Make
both
run
Just
use
the
whip
reminder
But
that
not
all
snarled
turning
Pippin
shan
forget
Payment
only
put
off
Leg
Neither
Pippin
nor
Merry
remembered
much
the
later
part
the
journey
Evil
dreams
and
evil
waking
were
blended
into
long
tunnel
misery
with
hope
growing
ever
fainter
behind
They
ran
and
they
ran
striving
keep
the
pace
set
the
Orcs
licked
every
now
and
again
with
cruel
thong
cunningly
handled
they
halted
stumbled
they
were
seized
and
dragged
for
some
distance
The
warmth
the
orc
draught
had
gone
Pippin
felt
cold
and
sick
again
Suddenly
fell
face
downward
the
turf
Hard
hands
with
rending
nails
gripped
and
lifted
him
was
carried
like
sack
once
more
and
darkness
grew
about
him
whether
the
darkness
another
night
blindness
his
eyes
could
not
tell
Dimly
became
aware
voices
clamouring
seemed
that
many
the
Orcs
were
demanding
halt
Uglúk
was
shouting
felt
himself
flung
the
ground
and
lay
fell
till
black
dreams
took
him
But
did
not
long
escape
from
pain
soon
the
iron
grip
merciless
hands
was
him
again
For
long
time
was
tossed
and
shaken
and
then
slowly
the
darkness
gave
way
and
came
back
the
waking
world
and
found
that
was
morning
Orders
were
shouted
and
was
thrown
roughly
the
grass
There
lay
for
while
fighting
with
despair
His
head
swam
but
from
the
heat
his
body
guessed
that
had
been
given
another
draught
Orc
stooped
over
him
and
flung
him
some
bread
and
strip
raw
dried
flesh
ate
the
stale
grey
bread
hungrily
but
not
the
meat
was
famished
but
not
yet
famished
eat
flesh
flung
him
Orc
the
flesh
dared
not
guess
what
creature
sat
and
looked
about
Merry
was
not
far
away
They
were
the
banks
swift
narrow
river
Ahead
mountains
loomed
tall
peak
was
catching
the
first
rays
the
sun
dark
smudge
forest
lay
the
lower
slopes
before
them
There
was
much
shouting
and
debating
among
the
Orcs
quarrel
seemed
the
point
breaking
out
again
between
the
Northerners
and
the
Isengarders
Some
were
pointing
back
away
south
and
some
were
pointing
eastward
Very
well
said
Uglúk
Leave
them
then
killing
told
you
before
but
you
want
throw
away
what
come
all
the
way
get
throw
away
look
after
Let
the
fighting
Uruk
hai
the
work
usual
you
afraid
the
Whiteskins
run
Run
There
the
forest
shouted
pointing
ahead
Get
your
best
hope
Off
you
And
quick
before
knock
few
more
heads
off
put
some
sense
into
the
others
There
was
some
cursing
and
scuffling
and
then
most
the
Northerners
broke
away
and
dashed
off
over
hundred
them
running
wildly
along
the
river
towards
the
mountains
The
hobbits
were
left
with
the
Isengarders
grim
dark
band
four
score
least
large
swart
slant
eyed
Orcs
with
great
bows
and
short
broad
bladed
swords
few
the
larger
and
bolder
Northerners
remained
with
them
Now
deal
with
Grishnákh
said
Uglúk
but
some
even
his
own
followers
were
looking
uneasily
southwards
know
growled
Uglúk
The
cursed
horse
boys
have
got
wind
But
that
all
your
fault
Snaga
You
and
the
other
scouts
ought
have
your
ears
cut
off
But
are
the
fighters
feast
horseflesh
yet
something
better
that
moment
Pippin
saw
why
some
the
troop
had
been
pointing
eastward
From
that
direction
there
now
came
hoarse
cries
and
there
was
Grishnákh
again
and
his
back
couple
score
others
like
him
long
armed
crook
legged
Orcs
They
had
red
eye
painted
their
shields
Uglúk
stepped
forward
meet
them
you
come
back
said
Thought
better
returned
see
that
Orders
are
carried
out
and
the
prisoners
safe
answered
Grishnákh
Indeed
said
Uglúk
Waste
effort
see
that
orders
are
carried
out
command
And
what
else
did
you
come
back
for
You
went
hurry
Did
you
leave
anything
behind
left
fool
snarled
Grishnákh
But
there
were
some
stout
fellows
with
him
that
are
too
good
lose
knew
you
lead
them
into
mess
come
help
them
Splendid
laughed
Uglúk
But
unless
you
got
some
guts
for
fighting
you
taken
the
wrong
way
Lugbúrz
was
your
road
The
Whiteskins
are
coming
What
happened
your
precious
Nazgûl
Has
had
another
mount
shot
under
him
Now
you
brought
him
along
that
might
have
been
useful
these
Nazgûl
are
all
they
make
out
_Nazgûl
Nazgûl_
said
Grishnákh
shivering
and
licking
his
lips
the
word
had
foul
taste
that
savoured
painfully
You
speak
what
deep
beyond
the
reach
your
muddy
dreams
Uglúk
said
_Nazgûl
_Ah
All
that
they
make
out
One
day
you
wish
that
you
had
not
said
that
Ape
snarled
fiercely
You
ought
know
that
they
the
apple
the
Great
Eye
But
the
winged
Nazgûl
not
yet
not
yet
won
let
them
show
themselves
across
the
Great
River
yet
not
too
soon
They
for
the
War
and
other
purposes
You
seem
know
lot
said
Uglúk
More
than
good
for
you
guess
Perhaps
those
Lugbúrz
might
wonder
how
and
why
But
the
meantime
the
Uruk
hai
Isengard
can
the
dirty
work
usual
Don
stand
slavering
there
Get
your
rabble
together
The
other
swine
are
legging
the
forest
You
better
follow
You
wouldn
get
back
the
Great
River
alive
Right
off
the
mark
Now
your
heels
The
Isengarders
seized
Merry
and
Pippin
again
and
slung
them
their
backs
Then
the
troop
started
off
Hour
after
hour
they
ran
pausing
now
and
again
only
sling
the
hobbits
fresh
carriers
Either
because
they
were
quicker
and
hardier
because
some
plan
Grishnákh
the
Isengarders
gradually
passed
through
the
Orcs
Mordor
and
Grishnákh
folk
closed
behind
Soon
they
were
gaining
also
the
Northerners
ahead
The
forest
began
draw
nearer
Pippin
was
bruised
and
torn
his
aching
head
was
grated
the
filthy
jowl
and
hairy
ear
the
Orc
that
held
him
Immediately
front
were
bowed
backs
and
tough
thick
legs
going
and
down
and
down
unresting
they
were
made
wire
and
horn
beating
out
the
nightmare
seconds
endless
time
the
afternoon
Uglúk
troop
overtook
the
Northerners
They
were
flagging
the
rays
the
bright
sun
winter
sun
shining
pale
cool
sky
though
was
their
heads
were
down
and
their
tongues
lolling
out
Maggots
jeered
the
Isengarders
You
cooked
The
Whiteskins
will
catch
you
and
eat
you
They
coming
cry
from
Grishnákh
showed
that
this
was
not
mere
jest
Horsemen
riding
very
swiftly
had
indeed
been
sighted
still
far
behind
but
gaining
the
Orcs
gaining
them
like
tide
over
the
flats
folk
straying
quicksand
The
Isengarders
began
run
with
redoubled
pace
that
astonished
Pippin
terrific
spurt
seemed
for
the
end
race
Then
saw
that
the
sun
was
sinking
falling
behind
the
Misty
Mountains
shadows
reached
over
the
land
The
soldiers
Mordor
lifted
their
heads
and
also
began
put
speed
The
forest
was
dark
and
close
Already
they
had
passed
few
outlying
trees
The
land
was
beginning
slope
upwards
ever
more
steeply
but
the
Orcs
did
not
halt
Both
Uglúk
and
Grishnákh
shouted
spurring
them
last
effort
They
will
make
yet
They
will
escape
thought
Pippin
And
then
managed
twist
his
neck
glance
back
with
one
eye
over
his
shoulder
saw
that
riders
away
eastward
were
already
level
with
the
Orcs
galloping
over
the
plain
The
sunset
gilded
their
spears
and
helmets
and
glinted
their
pale
flowing
hair
They
were
hemming
the
Orcs
preventing
them
from
scattering
and
driving
them
along
the
line
the
river
wondered
very
much
what
kind
folk
they
were
wished
now
that
had
learned
more
Rivendell
and
looked
more
maps
and
things
but
those
days
the
plans
for
the
journey
seemed
more
competent
hands
and
had
never
reckoned
with
being
cut
off
from
Gandalf
from
Strider
and
even
from
Frodo
All
that
could
remember
about
Rohan
was
that
Gandalf
horse
Shadowfax
had
come
from
that
land
That
sounded
hopeful
far
went
But
how
will
they
know
that
are
not
Orcs
thought
don
suppose
they
ever
heard
hobbits
down
here
suppose
ought
glad
that
the
beastly
Orcs
look
like
being
destroyed
but
would
rather
saved
myself
The
chances
were
that
and
Merry
would
killed
together
with
their
captors
before
ever
the
Men
Rohan
were
aware
them
few
the
riders
appeared
bowmen
skilled
shooting
from
running
horse
Riding
swiftly
into
range
they
shot
arrows
the
Orcs
that
straggled
behind
and
several
them
fell
then
the
riders
wheeled
away
out
the
range
the
answering
bows
their
enemies
who
shot
wildly
not
daring
halt
This
happened
many
times
and
one
occasion
arrows
fell
among
the
Isengarders
One
them
just
front
Pippin
stumbled
and
did
not
get
again
Night
came
down
without
the
Riders
closing
for
battle
Many
Orcs
had
fallen
but
fully
two
hundred
remained
the
early
darkness
the
Orcs
came
hillock
The
eaves
the
forest
were
very
near
probably
more
than
three
furlongs
away
but
they
could
further
The
horsemen
had
encircled
them
small
band
disobeyed
Uglúk
command
and
ran
towards
the
forest
only
three
returned
Well
here
are
sneered
Grishnákh
Fine
leadership
hope
the
great
Uglúk
will
lead
out
again
Put
those
Halflings
down
ordered
Uglúk
taking
notice
Grishnákh
You
Lugdush
get
two
others
and
stand
guard
over
them
They
not
killed
unless
the
filthy
Whiteskins
break
through
Understand
long
alive
want
But
they
not
cry
out
and
they
not
rescued
Bind
their
legs
The
last
part
the
order
was
carried
out
mercilessly
But
Pippin
found
that
for
the
first
time
was
close
Merry
The
Orcs
were
making
great
deal
noise
shouting
and
clashing
their
weapons
and
the
hobbits
managed
whisper
together
for
while
don
think
much
this
said
Merry
feel
nearly
done
Don
think
could
crawl
away
far
even
was
free
_Lembas
whispered
Pippin
_Lembas
got
some
Have
you
don
think
they
taken
anything
but
our
swords
Yes
had
packet
pocket
answered
Merry
but
must
battered
crumbs
Anyway
can
put
mouth
pocket
You
won
have
but
just
then
savage
kick
warned
Pippin
that
the
noise
had
died
down
and
the
guards
were
watchful
The
night
was
cold
and
still
All
round
the
knoll
which
the
Orcs
were
gathered
little
watch
fires
sprang
golden
red
the
darkness
complete
ring
them
They
were
within
long
bowshot
but
the
riders
did
not
show
themselves
against
the
light
and
the
Orcs
wasted
many
arrows
shooting
the
fires
until
Uglúk
stopped
them
The
riders
made
sound
Later
the
night
when
the
moon
came
out
the
mist
then
occasionally
they
could
seen
shadowy
shapes
that
glinted
now
and
again
the
white
light
they
moved
ceaseless
patrol
They
wait
for
the
Sun
curse
them
growled
one
the
guards
Why
don
get
together
and
charge
through
What
old
Uglúk
think
doing
should
like
know
daresay
you
would
snarled
Uglúk
stepping
from
behind
Meaning
don
think
all
Curse
you
You
bad
the
other
rabble
the
maggots
and
the
apes
Lugbúrz
good
trying
charge
with
them
They
just
squeal
and
bolt
and
there
are
more
than
enough
these
filthy
horse
boys
mop
our
lot
the
flat
There
only
one
thing
those
maggots
can
they
can
see
like
gimlets
the
dark
But
these
Whiteskins
have
better
night
eyes
than
most
Men
from
all
heard
and
don
forget
their
horses
They
can
see
the
night
breeze
said
Still
there
one
thing
the
fine
fellows
don
know
Mauhúr
and
his
lads
are
the
forest
and
they
should
turn
any
time
now
Uglúk
words
were
enough
apparently
satisfy
the
Isengarders
but
the
other
Orcs
were
both
dispirited
and
rebellious
They
posted
few
watchers
but
most
them
lay
the
ground
resting
the
pleasant
darkness
did
indeed
become
very
dark
again
for
the
moon
passed
westward
into
thick
cloud
and
Pippin
could
not
see
anything
few
feet
away
The
fires
brought
light
the
hillock
The
riders
were
not
however
content
merely
wait
for
the
dawn
and
let
their
enemies
rest
sudden
outcry
the
east
side
the
knoll
showed
that
something
was
wrong
seemed
that
some
the
Men
had
ridden
close
slipped
off
their
horses
crawled
the
edge
the
camp
and
killed
several
Orcs
and
then
had
faded
away
again
Uglúk
dashed
off
stop
stampede
Pippin
and
Merry
sat
Their
guards
Isengarders
had
gone
with
Uglúk
But
the
hobbits
had
any
thought
escape
was
soon
dashed
long
hairy
arm
took
each
them
the
neck
and
drew
them
close
together
Dimly
they
were
aware
Grishnákh
great
head
and
hideous
face
between
them
his
foul
breath
was
their
cheeks
began
paw
them
and
feel
them
Pippin
shuddered
hard
cold
fingers
groped
down
his
back
Well
little
ones
said
Grishnákh
soft
whisper
Enjoying
your
nice
rest
not
little
awkwardly
placed
perhaps
swords
and
whips
one
side
and
nasty
spears
the
other
Little
people
should
not
meddle
_in
affairs
that
are
too
big
for
them
His
fingers
continued
grope
There
was
light
like
pale
but
hot
fire
behind
his
eyes
The
thought
came
suddenly
into
Pippin
mind
caught
direct
from
the
urgent
thought
his
enemy
Grishnákh
knows
about
the
Ring
looking
for
while
Uglúk
busy
probably
wants
for
himself
Cold
fear
was
Pippin
heart
yet
the
same
time
was
wondering
what
use
could
make
Grishnákh
desire
don
think
you
will
find
that
way
whispered
isn
easy
find
_Find
said
Grishnákh
his
fingers
stopped
crawling
and
gripped
Pippin
shoulder
Find
what
What
are
you
talking
about
little
one
For
moment
Pippin
was
silent
Then
suddenly
the
darkness
made
noise
his
throat
_gollum
gollum_
Nothing
precious
added
The
hobbits
felt
Grishnákh
fingers
twitch
hissed
the
goblin
softly
That
what
means
Very
dangerous
little
ones
Perhaps
said
Merry
now
alert
and
aware
Pippin
guess
Perhaps
and
not
only
for
Still
you
know
your
own
business
best
you
want
not
And
what
would
you
give
for
want
want
said
Grishnákh
puzzled
but
his
arms
were
trembling
What
would
give
for
What
you
mean
mean
said
Pippin
choosing
his
words
carefully
that
good
groping
the
dark
could
save
you
time
and
trouble
But
you
must
untie
our
legs
first
nothing
and
say
nothing
dear
tender
little
fools
hissed
Grishnákh
everything
you
have
and
everything
you
know
will
got
out
you
due
time
everything
You
wish
there
was
more
that
you
could
tell
satisfy
the
Questioner
indeed
you
will
quite
soon
shan
hurry
the
enquiry
dear
What
you
think
you
been
kept
alive
for
dear
little
fellows
please
believe
when
say
that
was
not
out
kindness
that
not
even
one
Uglúk
faults
find
quite
easy
believe
said
Merry
But
you
haven
got
your
prey
home
yet
And
doesn
seem
going
your
way
whatever
happens
come
Isengard
won
the
great
Grishnákh
that
benefits
Saruman
will
take
all
that
can
find
you
want
anything
for
yourself
now
the
time
deal
Grishnákh
began
lose
his
temper
The
name
Saruman
seemed
specially
enrage
him
Time
was
passing
and
the
disturbance
was
dying
down
Uglúk
the
Isengarders
might
return
any
minute
Have
you
got
either
you
snarled
_Gollum
gollum
said
Pippin
Untie
our
legs
said
Merry
They
felt
the
Orc
arms
trembling
violently
Curse
you
you
filthy
little
vermin
hissed
Untie
your
legs
untie
every
string
your
bodies
you
think
can
search
you
the
bones
Search
you
cut
you
both
quivering
shreds
don
need
the
help
your
legs
get
you
away
and
have
you
all
myself
Suddenly
seized
them
The
strength
his
long
arms
and
shoulders
was
terrifying
tucked
them
one
under
each
armpit
and
crushed
them
fiercely
his
sides
great
stifling
hand
was
clapped
over
each
their
mouths
Then
sprang
forward
stooping
low
Quickly
and
silently
went
until
came
the
edge
the
knoll
There
choosing
gap
between
the
watchers
passed
like
evil
shadow
out
into
the
night
down
the
slope
and
away
westward
towards
the
river
that
flowed
out
the
forest
that
direction
there
was
wide
open
space
with
only
one
fire
After
going
dozen
yards
halted
peering
and
listening
Nothing
could
seen
heard
crept
slowly
bent
almost
double
Then
squatted
and
listened
again
Then
stood
risk
sudden
dash
that
very
moment
the
dark
form
rider
loomed
right
front
him
horse
snorted
and
reared
man
called
out
Grishnákh
flung
himself
the
ground
flat
dragging
the
hobbits
under
him
then
drew
his
sword
doubt
meant
kill
his
captives
rather
than
allow
them
escape
rescued
but
was
his
undoing
The
sword
rang
faintly
and
glinted
little
the
light
the
fire
away
his
left
arrow
came
whistling
out
the
gloom
was
aimed
with
skill
guided
fate
and
pierced
his
right
hand
dropped
the
sword
and
shrieked
There
was
quick
beat
hoofs
and
even
Grishnákh
leaped
and
ran
was
ridden
down
and
spear
passed
through
him
gave
hideous
shivering
cry
and
lay
still
The
hobbits
remained
flat
the
ground
Grishnákh
had
left
them
Another
horseman
came
riding
swiftly
his
comrade
aid
Whether
because
some
special
keenness
sight
because
some
other
sense
the
horse
lifted
and
sprang
lightly
over
them
but
its
rider
did
not
see
them
lying
covered
their
elven
cloaks
too
crushed
for
the
moment
and
too
afraid
move
last
Merry
stirred
and
whispered
softly
far
good
but
how
are
_we_
avoid
being
spitted
The
answer
came
almost
immediately
The
cries
Grishnákh
had
roused
the
Orcs
From
the
yells
and
screeches
that
came
from
the
knoll
the
hobbits
guessed
that
their
disappearance
had
been
discovered
Uglúk
was
probably
knocking
off
few
more
heads
Then
suddenly
the
answering
cries
orc
voices
came
from
the
right
outside
the
circle
watch
fires
from
the
direction
the
forest
and
the
mountains
Mauhúr
had
apparently
arrived
and
was
attacking
the
besiegers
There
was
the
sound
galloping
horses
The
Riders
were
drawing
their
ring
close
round
the
knoll
risking
the
orc
arrows
prevent
any
sortie
while
company
rode
off
deal
with
the
newcomers
Suddenly
Merry
and
Pippin
realized
that
without
moving
they
were
now
outside
the
circle
there
was
nothing
between
them
and
escape
Now
said
Merry
only
had
our
legs
and
hands
free
might
get
away
But
can
touch
the
knots
and
can
bite
them
need
try
said
Pippin
was
going
tell
you
managed
free
hands
These
loops
are
only
left
for
show
You
better
have
bit
_lembas_
first
slipped
the
cords
off
his
wrists
and
fished
out
packet
The
cakes
were
broken
but
good
still
their
leaf
wrappings
The
hobbits
each
ate
two
three
pieces
The
taste
brought
back
them
the
memory
fair
faces
and
laughter
and
wholesome
food
quiet
days
now
far
away
For
while
they
ate
thoughtfully
sitting
the
dark
heedless
the
cries
and
sounds
battle
nearby
Pippin
was
the
first
come
back
the
present
must
off
said
Half
moment
Grishnákh
sword
was
lying
close
hand
but
was
too
heavy
and
clumsy
for
him
use
crawled
forward
and
finding
the
body
the
goblin
drew
from
its
sheath
long
sharp
knife
With
this
quickly
cut
their
bonds
Now
for
said
When
warmed
bit
perhaps
shall
able
stand
again
and
walk
But
any
case
had
better
start
crawling
They
crawled
The
turf
was
deep
and
yielding
and
that
helped
them
but
seemed
long
slow
business
They
gave
the
watch
fire
wide
berth
and
wormed
their
way
forward
bit
bit
until
they
came
the
edge
the
river
gurgling
away
the
black
shadows
under
its
deep
banks
Then
they
looked
back
The
sounds
had
died
away
Evidently
Mauhúr
and
his
lads
had
been
killed
driven
off
The
Riders
had
returned
their
silent
ominous
vigil
would
not
last
very
much
longer
Already
the
night
was
old
the
East
which
had
remained
unclouded
the
sky
was
beginning
grow
pale
must
get
under
cover
said
Pippin
shall
seen
will
not
any
comfort
these
riders
discover
that
are
not
Orcs
after
are
dead
got
and
stamped
his
feet
Those
cords
have
cut
like
wires
but
feet
are
getting
warm
again
could
stagger
now
What
about
you
Merry
Merry
got
Yes
said
can
manage
_Lembas_
does
put
heart
into
you
more
wholesome
sort
feeling
too
than
the
heat
that
orc
draught
wonder
what
was
made
Better
not
know
expect
Let
get
drink
water
wash
away
the
thought
Not
here
the
banks
are
too
steep
said
Pippin
Forward
now
They
turned
and
walked
side
side
slowly
along
the
line
the
river
Behind
them
the
light
grew
the
East
they
walked
they
compared
notes
talking
lightly
hobbit
fashion
the
things
that
had
happened
since
their
capture
listener
would
have
guessed
from
their
words
that
they
had
suffered
cruelly
and
been
dire
peril
going
without
hope
towards
torment
and
death
that
even
now
they
knew
well
they
had
little
chance
ever
finding
friend
safety
again
You
seem
have
been
doing
well
Master
Took
said
Merry
You
will
get
almost
chapter
old
Bilbo
book
ever
get
chance
report
him
Good
work
especially
guessing
that
hairy
villain
little
game
and
playing
him
But
wonder
anyone
will
ever
pick
your
trail
and
find
that
brooch
should
hate
lose
mine
but
afraid
yours
gone
for
good
shall
have
brush
toes
get
level
with
you
Indeed
Cousin
Brandybuck
going
front
now
This
where
comes
don
suppose
you
have
much
notion
where
are
but
spent
time
Rivendell
rather
better
are
walking
west
along
the
Entwash
The
butt
end
the
Misty
Mountains
front
and
Fangorn
Forest
Even
spoke
the
dark
edge
the
forest
loomed
straight
before
them
Night
seemed
have
taken
refuge
under
its
great
trees
creeping
away
from
the
coming
Dawn
Lead
Master
Brandybuck
said
Pippin
lead
back
have
been
warned
against
Fangorn
But
one
knowing
will
not
have
forgotten
that
have
not
answered
Merry
but
the
forest
seems
better
all
the
same
than
turning
back
into
the
middle
battle
led
the
way
under
the
huge
branches
the
trees
Old
beyond
guessing
they
seemed
Great
trailing
beards
lichen
hung
from
them
blowing
and
swaying
the
breeze
Out
the
shadows
the
hobbits
peeped
gazing
back
down
the
slope
little
furtive
figures
that
the
dim
light
looked
like
elf
children
the
deeps
time
peering
out
the
Wild
Wood
wonder
their
first
Dawn
Far
over
the
Great
River
and
the
Brown
Lands
leagues
upon
grey
leagues
away
the
Dawn
came
red
flame
Loud
rang
the
hunting
horns
greet
The
Riders
Rohan
sprang
suddenly
life
Horn
answered
horn
again
Merry
and
Pippin
heard
clear
the
cold
air
the
neighing
war
horses
and
the
sudden
singing
many
men
The
Sun
limb
was
lifted
arc
fire
above
the
margin
the
world
Then
with
great
cry
the
Riders
charged
from
the
East
the
red
light
gleamed
mail
and
spear
The
Orcs
yelled
and
shot
all
the
arrows
that
remained
them
The
hobbits
saw
several
horsemen
fall
but
their
line
held
the
hill
and
over
and
wheeled
round
and
charged
again
Most
the
raiders
that
were
left
alive
then
broke
and
fled
this
way
and
that
pursued
one
one
the
death
But
one
band
holding
together
black
wedge
drove
forward
resolutely
the
direction
the
forest
Straight
the
slope
they
charged
towards
the
watchers
Now
they
were
drawing
near
and
seemed
certain
that
they
would
escape
they
had
already
hewn
down
three
Riders
that
barred
their
way
have
watched
too
long
said
Merry
There
Uglúk
don
want
meet
him
again
The
hobbits
turned
and
fled
deep
into
the
shadows
the
wood
was
that
they
did
not
sec
the
last
stand
when
Uglúk
was
overtaken
and
brought
bay
the
very
edge
Fangorn
There
was
slain
last
Éomer
the
Third
Marshal
the
Mark
who
dismounted
and
fought
him
sword
sword
And
over
the
wide
fields
the
keen
eyed
Riders
hunted
down
the
few
Orcs
that
had
escaped
and
still
had
strength
fly
Then
when
they
had
laid
their
fallen
comrades
mound
and
had
sung
their
praises
the
Riders
made
great
fire
and
scattered
the
ashes
their
enemies
ended
the
raid
and
news
came
ever
back
either
Mordor
Isengard
but
the
smoke
the
burning
rose
high
heaven
and
was
seen
many
watchful
eyes
_Chapter
Treebeard
Meanwhile
the
hobbits
went
with
much
speed
the
dark
and
tangled
forest
allowed
following
the
line
the
running
stream
westward
and
towards
the
slopes
the
mountains
deeper
and
deeper
into
Fangorn
Slowly
their
fear
the
Orcs
died
away
and
their
pace
slackened
queer
stifling
feeling
came
over
them
the
air
were
too
thin
too
scanty
for
breathing
last
Merry
halted
can
like
this
panted
want
some
air
Let
have
drink
any
rate
said
Pippin
parched
clambered
great
tree
root
that
wound
down
into
the
stream
and
stooping
drew
some
water
his
cupped
hands
was
clear
and
cold
and
took
many
draughts
Merry
followed
him
The
water
refreshed
them
and
seemed
cheer
their
hearts
for
while
they
sat
together
the
brink
the
stream
dabbling
their
sore
feet
and
legs
and
peering
round
the
trees
that
stood
silently
about
them
rank
upon
rank
until
they
faded
away
into
grey
twilight
every
direction
suppose
you
haven
lost
already
said
Pippin
leaning
back
against
great
tree
trunk
can
least
follow
the
course
this
stream
the
Entwash
whatever
you
call
and
get
out
again
the
way
came
could
our
legs
would
said
Merry
and
could
breathe
properly
Yes
all
very
dim
and
stuffy
here
said
Pippin
reminds
somehow
the
old
room
the
Great
Place
the
Tooks
away
back
the
Smials
Tuckborough
huge
place
where
the
furniture
has
never
been
moved
changed
for
generations
They
say
the
Old
Took
lived
year
after
year
while
and
the
room
got
older
and
shabbier
together
and
has
never
changed
since
died
century
ago
And
Old
Gerontius
was
great
great
grandfather
that
puts
back
bit
But
that
nothing
the
old
feeling
this
wood
Look
all
those
weeping
trailing
beards
and
whiskers
lichen
And
most
the
trees
seem
half
covered
with
ragged
dry
leaves
that
have
never
fallen
Untidy
can
imagine
what
spring
would
look
like
here
ever
comes
still
less
spring
cleaning
But
the
Sun
any
rate
must
peep
sometimes
said
Merry
does
not
look
feel
all
like

Mirkwood
That
was

and
black

black
things
This
just
dim
and
frightfully
tree
ish
You
can
imagine
_animals_
living
here
all
staying
for
long
nor
hobbits
said
Pippin
And
don
like
the
thought
trying
get
through
either
Nothing
eat
for
hundred
miles
should
guess
How
are
our
supplies
Low
said
Merry
ran
off
with
nothing
but
couple
spare
packets
_lembas_
and
left
everything
else
behind
They
looked
what
remained
the
elven
cakes
broken
fragments
for
about
five
meagre
days
that
was
all
And
not
wrap
blanket
said
Merry
shall
cold
tonight
whichever
way
Well
better
decide
the
way
now
said
Pippin
The
morning
must
getting
Just
then
they
became
aware
yellow
light
that
had
appeared
some
way
further
into
the
wood
shafts
sunlight
seemed
suddenly
have
pierced
the
forest
roof
Hullo
said
Merry
The
Sun
must
have
run
into
cloud
while
been
under
these
trees
and
now
she
has
run
out
again
else
she
has
climbed
high
enough
look
down
through
some
opening
isn
far
let
and
investigate
They
found
was
further
than
they
thought
The
ground
was
rising
steeply
still
and
was
becoming
increasingly
stony
The
light
grew
broader
they
went
and
soon
they
saw
that
there
was
rock
wall
before
them
the
side
hill
the
abrupt
end
some
long
root
thrust
out
the
distant
mountains
trees
grew
and
the
sun
was
falling
full
its
stony
face
The
twigs
the
trees
its
foot
were
stretched
out
stiff
and
still
reaching
out
the
warmth
Where
all
had
looked
shabby
and
grey
before
the
wood
now
gleamed
with
rich
browns
and
with
the
smooth
black
greys
bark
like
polished
leather
The
boles
the
trees
glowed
with
soft
green
like
young
grass
early
spring
fleeting
vision
was
about
them
the
face
the
stony
wall
there
was
something
like
stair
natural
perhaps
and
made
the
weathering
and
splitting
the
rock
for
was
rough
and
uneven
High
almost
level
with
the
tops
forest
trees
there
was
shelf
under
cliff
Nothing
grew
there
but
few
grasses
and
weeds
its
edge
and
one
old
stump
tree
with
only
two
bent
branches
left
looked
almost
like
the
figure
some
gnarled
old
man
standing
there
blinking
the
morning
light
said
Merry
joyfully
Now
for
breath
air
and
sight
the
land
They
climbed
and
scrambled
the
rock
the
stair
had
been
made
was
for
bigger
feet
and
longer
legs
than
theirs
They
were
too
eager
surprised
the
remarkable
way
which
the
cuts
and
sores
their
captivity
had
healed
and
their
vigour
had
returned
They
came
length
the
edge
the
shelf
almost
the
feet
the
old
stump
then
they
sprang
and
turned
round
with
their
backs
the
hill
breathing
deep
and
looking
out
eastward
They
saw
that
they
had
only
come
some
three
four
miles
into
the
forest
the
heads
the
trees
marched
down
the
slopes
towards
the
plain
There
near
the
fringe
the
forest
tall
spires
curling
black
smoke
went
wavering
and
floating
towards
them
The
wind
changing
said
Merry
turned
east
again
feels
cool
here
Yes
said
Pippin
afraid
this
only
passing
gleam
and
will
all
grey
again
What
pity
This
shaggy
old
forest
looked
different
the
sunlight
almost
felt
liked
the
place
Almost
felt
you
liked
the
Forest
That
good
That
uncommonly
kind
you
said
strange
voice
Turn
round
and
let
have
look
your
faces
almost
feel
that
dislike
you
both
but
not
let
hasty
Turn
round
large
knob
knuckled
hand
was
laid
each
their
shoulders
and
they
were
twisted
round
gently
but
irresistibly
then
two
great
arms
lifted
them
They
found
that
they
were
looking
most
extraordinary
face
belonged
large
Man
like
almost
Troll
like
figure
least
fourteen
foot
high
very
sturdy
with
tall
head
and
hardly
any
neck
Whether
was
clad
stuff
like
green
and
grey
bark
whether
that
was
its
hide
was
difficult
say
any
rate
the
arms
short
distance
from
the
trunk
were
not
wrinkled
but
covered
with
brown
smooth
skin
The
large
feet
had
seven
toes
each
The
lower
part
the
long
face
was
covered
with
sweeping
grey
beard
bushy
almost
twiggy
the
roots
thin
and
mossy
the
ends
But
the
moment
the
hobbits
noted
little
but
the
eyes
These
deep
eyes
were
now
surveying
them
slow
and
solemn
but
very
penetrating
They
were
brown
shot
with
green
light
Often
afterwards
Pippin
tried
describe
his
first
impression
them
One
felt
there
was
enormous
well
behind
them
filled
with
ages
memory
and
long
slow
steady
thinking
but
their
surface
was
sparkling
with
the
present
like
sun
shimmering
the
outer
leaves
vast
tree
the
ripples
very
deep
lake
don
know
but
felt
something
that
grew
the
ground
asleep
you
might
say
just
feeling
itself
something
between
roof
tip
and
leaf
tip
between
deep
earth
and
sky
had
suddenly
waked
and
was
considering
you
with
the
same
slow
care
that
had
given
its
own
inside
affairs
for
endless
years
_Hrum
Hoom_
murmured
the
voice
deep
voice
like
very
deep
woodwind
instrument
Very
odd
indeed
not
hasty
that
motto
But
had
seen
you
before
heard
your
voices
liked
them
nice
little
voices
they
reminded
something
cannot
remember
had
seen
you
before
heard
you
should
have
just
trodden
you
taking
you
for
little
Orcs
and
found
out
mistake
afterwards
Very
odd
you
are
indeed
Root
and
twig
very
odd
Pippin
though
still
amazed
longer
felt
afraid
Under
those
eyes
felt
curious
suspense
but
not
fear
Please
said
who
are
you
And
what
are
you
queer
look
came
into
the
old
eyes
kind
wariness
the
deep
wells
were
covered
over
_Hrum_
now
answered
the
voice
well
Ent
that
what
they
call
Yes
Ent
the
word
_The_
Ent
you
might
say
your
manner
speaking
_Fangorn_
name
according
some
_Treebeard_
others
make
_Treebeard_
will
_Ent_
said
Merry
What
that
But
what
you
call
yourself
What
your
real
name
Hoo
now
replied
Treebeard
Hoo
Now
that
would
telling
Not
hasty
And
_I_
doing
the
asking
You
are
_my_
country
What
are
_you_
wonder
cannot
place
you
You
not
seem
come
the
old
lists
that
learned
when
was
young
But
that
was
long
long
time
ago
and
they
may
have
made
new
lists
Let
see

But
anyway
you
not

always
seem

left
out
the
old

and
the
old
stories
said
Merry
Yet
been
about
for
quite
long
time
_hobbits_
Why
not
make
new
line
said
Pippin
Half
grown
hobbits
the
hole
dwellers
Put
amongst
the

next
Man
the
Big
People
and
you
got
Not
bad
not

said
Treebeard
That
would
you
live
holes
sounds
very
right
and
proper
Who
calls
you
_hobbits_
though
That
does
not
sound
elvish
Elves
made
all
the
old
words
they
began
Nobody
else
calls
hobbits
call
ourselves
that
said
Pippin
Hoom
hmm
Come
now
Not
hasty
You
call
_yourselves_
hobbits
But
you
should
not
telling
just
anybody
You
letting
out
your
own
right
names
you
not
careful
aren
careful
about
that
said
Merry
matter
fact
Brandybuck
Meriadoc
Brandybuck
though
most
people
call
just
Merry
And
Took
Peregrin
Took
but
generally
called
Pippin
even
Pip
but
you
_are_
hasty
folk
see
said
Treebeard
honoured
your
confidence
but
you
should
not
too
free
all
once
There
are
Ents
and
Ents
you
know
there
are
Ents
and
things
that
look
like
Ents
but
ain
you
might
say
call
you
Merry
and
Pippin
you
please
nice
names
For
not
going
tell
you
name
not
yet
any
rate
queer
half
knowing
half
humorous
look
came
with
green
flicker
into
his
eyes
For
one
thing
would
take
long
while
name
growing
all
the
time
and
lived
very
long
long

_my_

Real

tell

the
Old

you
might
say
lovely
language
but
takes
very
long
time
say
anything
because
not
say
anything
unless
worth
taking
long
time
say
and
listen
But
now
and
the
eyes
became
very
bright
and
present
seeming
grow
smaller
and
almost
sharp
what
going
What

not

what
the

the
outside

you
know
the
thing
are
where
stand
and
look
out
fine
mornings
and
think
about
the
Sun
and
the
grass
beyond
the
wood
and
the
horses
and
the
clouds
and
the
unfolding
the
world
What
going
What
Gandalf
And
these
_burárum_
made
deep
rumbling
noise
like
discord
great
organ
these
Orcs
and
young
Saruman
down
Isengard
like
news
But
not
too
quick
now
There
quite
lot
going
said
Merry
and
even
tried
quick
would
take
long
time
tell
But
you
told
not
hasty
Ought
tell
you
anything
soon
Would
you
think
rude
asked
what
you
are
going
with
and
which
side
you
are
And
did
you
know
Gandalf
Yes
know
him
the
only
wizard
that
really
cares
about
trees
said
Treebeard
you
know
him
Yes
said
Pippin
sadly
did
was
great
friend
and
was
our
guide
Then
can
answer
your
other
questions
said
Treebeard
not
going
anything
_with_
you
not
you
mean
that
something
_to_
you
without
your
leave
might
some
things
together
don
know
about
_sides_
own
way
but
your
way
may
along
with
mine
for
while
But
you
speak
Master
Gandalf
was
story
that
had
come
end
Yes
said
Pippin
sadly
The
story
seems
going
but
afraid
Gandalf
has
fallen
out
Hoo
come
now
said
Treebeard
Hoom
well
paused
looking
long
the
hobbits
Hoom
well
not
know
what
say
Come
now
you
would
like
hear
more
said
Merry
will
tell
you
But
will
take
some
time
Wouldn
you
like
put
down
Couldn
sit
here
together
the
sun
while
lasts
You
must
getting
tired
holding
_tired_
not
tired
not
easily
get
tired
And
not
sit
down
not
very
bendable
But
there
the
Sun
_is_
going
Let
leave
this
did
you
say
what
you
call
Hill
suggested
Pippin
Shelf
Step
suggested
Merry
Treebeard
repeated
the
words
thoughtfully
_Hill_
Yes
that
was
But
hasty
word
for
thing
that
has
stood
here
ever
since
this
part
the
world
was
shaped
Never
mind
Let
leave
and
Where
shall
asked
Merry
home
one
homes
answered
Treebeard
far
not
know
You
might
call
far
perhaps
But
what
does
that
matter
Well
you
see
have
lost
all
our
belongings
said
Merry
have
only
little
food
You
need
not
trouble
about
that
said
Treebeard
can
give
you
drink
that
will
keep
you
green
and
growing
for
long
long
while
And
decide
part
company
can
set
you
down
outside
country
any
point
you
choose
Let
Holding
the
hobbits
gently
but
firmly
one
the
crook
each
arm
Treebeard
lifted
first
one
large
foot
and
then
the
other
and
moved
them
the
edge
the
shelf
The
rootlike
toes
grasped
the
rocks
Then
carefully
and
solemnly
stalked
down
from
step
step
and
reached
the
floor
the
Forest
once
set
off
with
long
deliberate
strides
through
the
trees
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
wood
never
far
from
the
stream
climbing
steadily
towards
the
slopes
the
mountains
Many
the
trees
seemed
asleep
unaware
him
any
other
creature
that
merely
passed
but
some
quivered
and
some
raised
their
branches
above
his
head
approached
All
the
while
walked
talked
himself
long
running
stream
musical
sounds
The
hobbits
were
silent
for
some
time
They
felt
oddly
enough
safe
and
comfortable
and
they
had
great
deal
think
and
wonder
about
last
Pippin
ventured
speak
again
Please
Treebeard
said
could
ask
you
something
Why
did
Celeborn
warn
against
your
forest
told
not
risk
getting
entangled
Hmm
did
now
rumbled
Treebeard
And
might
have
said
much
the
same
you
had
been
going
the
other
way
not
risk
getting
entangled
the
woods
_Laurelindórenan_
That
what
the
Elves
used
call
but
now
they
make
the
name
shorter
Lothlórien
they
call
Perhaps
they
are
right
maybe
fading
not
growing
Land
the
Valley
Singing
Gold
that
was
once
upon
time
Now
the
Dreamflower
well
But
queer
place
and
not
for
just
any
one
venture
surprised
that
you
ever
got
out
but
much
more
surprised
that
you
ever
got
that
has
not
happened
strangers
for
many
year
queer
land
And
this
Folk
have
come
grief
here
Aye
they
have
grief
Laurelindórenan
lindelorendor
malinornélion
ornemalin_
hummed
himself
They
are
falling
rather
behind
the
world
there
guess
said
Neither
this
country
nor
anything
else
outside
the
Golden
Wood
what
was
when
Celeborn
was
young
Still
Taurelilómëa
tumbalemorna
Tumbaletaurëa
Lómëanor
that
what
they
used
say
Things
have
changed
but
still
true
places
What
you
mean
said
Pippin
What
true
The
trees
and
the
Ents
said
Treebeard
not
understand
all
that
goes
myself
cannot
explain
you
Some
are
still
true
Ents
and
lively
enough
our
fashion
but
many
are
growing
sleepy
going
tree
ish
you
might
say
Most
the
trees
are
just
trees
course
but
many
are
half
awake
Some
are
quite
wide
awake
and
few
are
well
well
getting
_Entish_
That
going
all
the
time
When
that
happens
tree
you
find
that
some
have
bad
hearts
Nothing
with
their
wood
not
mean
that
Why
knew
some
good
old
willows
down
the
Entwash
gone
long
ago
alas
They
were
quite
hollow
indeed
they
were
falling
all
pieces
but
quiet
and
sweet
spoken
young
leaf
And
then
there
are
some
trees
the
valleys
under
the
mountains
sound
bell
and
bad
right
through
That
sort
thing
seems
spread
There
used
some
very
dangerous
parts
this
country
There
are
still
some
very
black
patches
Like
the
Old
Forest
away
the
north
you
mean
asked
Merry
Aye
aye
something
like
but
much
worse
not
doubt
there
some
shadow
the
Great
Darkness
lying
there
still
away
north
and
bad
memories
are
handed
down
But
there
are
hollow
dales
this
land
where
the
Darkness
has
never
been
lifted
and
the
trees
are
older
than
Still
what
can
keep
off
strangers
and
the
foolhardy
and
train
and
teach
walk
and
weed
are
tree
herds
old
Ents
Few
enough
are
left
now
Sheep
get
like
shepherd
and
shepherds
like
sheep
said
but
slowly
and
neither
have
long
the
world
quicker
and
closer
with
trees
and
Ents
and
they
walk
down
the
ages
together
For
Ents
are
more
like
Elves
less
interested
themselves
than
Men
are
and
better
getting
inside
other
things
And
yet
again
Ents
are
more
like
Men
more
changeable
than
Elves
are
and
quicker
taking
the
colour
the
outside
you
might
say
better
than
both
for
they
are
steadier
and
keep
their
minds
things
longer
Some
kin
look
just
like
trees
now
and
need
something
great
rouse
them
and
they
speak
only
whispers
But
some
trees
are
limb
lithe
and
many
can
talk
Elves
began
course
waking
trees
and
teaching
them
speak
and
learning
their
tree
talk
They
always
wished
talk
everything
the
old
Elves
did
But
then
the
Great
Darkness
came
and
they
passed
away
over
the
Sea
fled
into
far
valleys
and
hid
themselves
and
made
songs
about
days
that
would
never
come
again
Never
again
Aye
aye
there
was
all
one
wood
once
upon
time
from
here
the
Mountains
Lune
and
this
was
just
the
East
End
Those
were
the
broad
days
Time
was
when
could
walk
and
sing
all
day
and
hear
more
than
the
echo
own
voice
the
hollow
hills
The
woods
were
like
the
woods
Lothlórien
only
thicker
stronger
younger
And
the
smell
the
air
used
spend
week
just
breathing
Treebeard
fell
silent
striding
along
and
yet
making
hardly
sound
with
his
great
feet
Then
began
hum
again
and
passed
into
murmuring
chant
Gradually
the
hobbits

Tauremornalómë
ended
and
strode
silently
and
all
the
wood
far
ear
could
reach
there
was
not
sound
The
day
waned
and
dusk
was
twined
about
the
boles
the
trees
last
the
hobbits
saw
rising
dimly
before
them
steep
dark
land
they
had
come
the
feet
the
mountains
and
the
green
roots
tall
Methedras
Down
the
hillside
the
young
Entwash
leaping
from
its
springs
high
above
ran
noisily
from
step
step
meet
them
the
right
the
stream
there
was
long
slope
clad
with
grass
now
grey
the
twilight
trees
grew
there
and
was
open
the
sky
stars
were
shining
already
lakes
between
shores
cloud
Treebeard
strode
the
slope
hardly
slackening
his
pace
Suddenly
before
them
the
hobbits
saw
wide
opening
Two
great
trees
stood
there
one
either
side
like
living
gate
posts
but
there
was
gate
save
their
crossing
and
interwoven
boughs
the
old
Ent
approached
the
trees
lifted
their
branches
and
all
their
leaves
quivered
and
rustled
For
they
were
evergreen
trees
and
their
leaves
were
dark
and
polished
and
gleamed
the
twilight
Beyond
them
was
wide
level
space
though
the
floor
great
hall
had
been
cut
the
side
the
hill
either
hand
the
walls
sloped
upwards
until
they
were
fifty
feet
high
more
and
along
each
wall
stood
aisle
trees
that
also
increased
height
they
marched
inwards
the
far
end
the
rock
wall
was
sheer
but
the
bottom
had
been
hollowed
back
into
shallow
bay
with
arched
roof
the
only
roof
the
hall
save
the
branches
the
trees
which
the
inner
end
overshadowed
all
the
ground
leaving
only
broad
open
path
the
middle
little
stream
escaped
from
the
springs
above
and
leaving
the
main
water
fell
tinkling
down
the
sheer
face
the
wall
pouring
silver
drops
like
fine
curtain
front
the
arched
bay
The
water
was
gathered
again
into
stone
basin
the
floor
between
the
trees
and
thence
spilled
and
flowed
away
beside
the
open
path
out
rejoin
the
Entwash
its
journey
through
the
forest
Here
are
said
Treebeard
breaking
his
long
silence
have
brought
you
about
seventy
thousand
ent
strides
but
what
that
comes
the
measurement
your
land
not
know
Anyhow
are
near
the
roots
the
Last
Mountain
Part
the
name
this
place
might
Wellinghall
were
turned
into
your
language
like
will
stay
here
tonight
set
them
down
the
grass
between
the
aisles
the
trees
and
they
followed
him
towards
the
great
arch
The
hobbits
now
noticed
that
walked
his
knees
hardly
bent
but
his
legs
opened
great
stride
planted
his
big
toes
and
they
were
indeed
big
and
very
broad
the
ground
first
before
any
other
part
his
feet
For
moment
Treebeard
stood
under
the
rain
the
falling
spring
and
took
deep
breath
then
laughed
and
passed
inside
great
stone
table
stood
there
but
chairs
the
back
the
bay
was
already
quite
dark
Treebeard
lifted
two
great
vessels
and
stood
them
the
table
They
seemed
filled
with
water
but
held
his
hands
over
them
and
immediately
they
began
glow
one
with
golden
and
the
other
with
rich
green
light
and
the
blending
the
two
lights
lit
the
bay
the
sun
summer
was
shining
through
roof
young
leaves
Looking
back
the
hobbits
saw
that
the
trees
the
court
had
also
begun
glow
faintly
first
but
steadily
quickening
until
every
leaf
was
edged
with
light
some
green
some
gold
some
red
copper
while
the
tree
trunks
looked
like
pillars
moulded
out
luminous
stone
Well
well
now
can
talk
again
said
Treebeard
You
are
thirsty
expect
Perhaps
you
are
also
tired
Drink
this
went
the
back
the
bay
and
then
they
saw
that
several
tall
stone
jars
stood
there
with
heavy
lids
removed
one
the
lids
and
dipped
great
ladle
and
with
filled
three
bowls
one
very
large
bowl
and
two
smaller
ones
This
ent
house
said
and
there
are
seats
fear
But
you
may
sit
the
table
Picking
the
hobbits
set
them
the
great
stone
slab
six
feet
above
the
ground
and
there
they
sat
dangling
their
legs
and
drinking
sips
The
drink
was
like
water
indeed
very
like
the
taste
the
draughts
they
had
drunk
from
the
Entwash
near
the
borders
the
forest
and
yet
there
was
some
scent
savour
which
they
could
not
describe
was
faint
but
reminded
them
the
smell
distant
wood
borne
from
afar
cool
breeze
night
The
effect
the
draught
began
the
toes
and
rose
steadily
through
every
limb
bringing
refreshment
and
vigour
coursed
upwards
right
the
tips
the
hair
Indeed
the
hobbits
felt
that
the
hair
their
heads
was
actually
standing
waving
and
curling
and
growing
for
Treebeard
first
laved
his
feet
the
basin
beyond
the
arch
and
then
drained
his
bowl
one
draught
one
long
slow
draught
The
hobbits
thought
would
never
stop
last
set
the
bowl
down
again
sighed
hoom
now
can
talk
easier
You
can
sit
the
floor
and
will
lie
down
that
will
prevent
this
drink
from
rising
head
and
sending
sleep
the
right
side
the
bay
there
was
great
bed
low
legs
not
more
than
couple
feet
high
covered
deep
dried
grass
and
bracken
Treebeard
lowered
himself
slowly
this
with
only
the
slightest
sign
bending
his
middle
until
lay
full
length
with
his
arms
behind
his
head
looking
the
ceiling
upon
which
lights
were
flickering
like
the
play
leaves
the
sunshine
Merry
and
Pippin
sat
beside
him
pillows
grass
Now
tell
your
tale
and
not
hurry
said
Treebeard
The
hobbits
began
tell
him
the
story
their
adventures
ever
since
they
left
Hobbiton
They
followed
very
clear
order
for
they
interrupted
one
another
continually
and
Treebeard
often
stopped
the
speaker
and
went
back
some
earlier
point
jumped
forward
asking
questions
about
later
events
They
said
nothing
whatever
about
the
Ring
and
did
not
tell
him
why
they
set
out
where
they
were
going
and
did
not
ask
for
any
reasons
was
immensely
interested
everything
the
Black
Riders
Elrond
and
Rivendell
the
Old
Forest
and
Tom
Bombadil
the
Mines
Moria
and
Lothlórien
and
Galadriel
made
them
describe
the
Shire
and
its
country
over
and
over
again
said
odd
thing
this
point
You
never
see
any
any
Ents
round
there
you
asked
Well
not
Ents
_Entwives_
should
really
say
_Entwives_
said
Pippin
Are
they
like
you
all
Yes
well
not
really
know
now
said
Treebeard
thoughtfully
But
they
would
like
your
country
just
wondered
Treebeard
was
however
especially
interested
everything
that
concerned
Gandalf
and
most
interested
all
Saruman
doings
The
hobbits
regretted
very
much
that
they
knew
little
about
them
only
rather
vague
report
Sam
what
Gandalf
had
told
the
Council
But
they
were
clear
any
rate
that
Uglúk
and
his
troop
came
from
Isengard
and
spoke
Saruman
their
master
hoom
said
Treebeard
when
last
their
story
had
wound
and
wandered
down
the
battle
the
Orcs
and
the
Riders
Rohan
Well
well
That
bundle
news
and
mistake
You
have
not
told
all
indeed
not
long
way
But
not
doubt
that
you
are
doing
Gandalf
would
wish
There
something
very
big
going
that
can
see
and
what
maybe
shall
learn
good
time
bad
time
root
and
twig
but
strange
business
sprout
little
folk
that
are
not
the
old
lists
and
behold
the
Nine
forgotten
Riders
reappear
hunt
them
and
Gandalf
takes
them
great
journey
and
Galadriel
harbours
them
Caras
Galadhon
and
Orcs
pursue
them
down
all
the
leagues
Wilderland
indeed
they
seem
caught
great
storm
hope
they
weather
And
what
about
yourself
asked
Merry
Hoom
have
not
troubled
about
the
Great
Wars
said
Treebeard
they
mostly
concern
Elves
and
Men
That
the
business
Wizards
Wizards
are
always
troubled
about
the
future
not
like
worrying
about
the
future
not
altogether
anybody
_side_
because
nobody
altogether
_side_
you
understand
nobody
cares
for
the
woods
care
for
them
not
even
Elves
nowadays
Still
take
more
kindly
Elves
than
others
was
the
Elves
that
cured
dumbness
long
ago
and
that
was
great
gift
that
cannot
forgotten
though
our
ways
have
parted
since
And
there
are
some
things
course
whose
side
altogether
_not_
against
them
altogether
these
burárum
again
made
deep
rumble
disgust
these
Orcs
and
their
masters
used
anxious
when
the
shadow
lay
Mirkwood
but
when
removed
Mordor
did
not
trouble
for
while
Mordor
long
way
away
But
seems
that
the
wind
setting
East
and
the
withering
all
woods
may
drawing
near
There
naught
that
old
Ent
can
hold
back
that
storm
must
weather
crack
But
Saruman
now
Saruman
neighbour
cannot
overlook
him
must
something
suppose
have
often
wondered
lately
what
should
about
Saruman
Who
Saruman
asked
Pippin
you
know
anything
about
his
history
Saruman
Wizard
answered
Treebeard
More
than
that
cannot
say
not
know
the
history
Wizards
They
appeared
first
after
the
Great
Ships
came
over
the
Sea
but
they
came
with
the
Ships
never
can
tell
Saruman
was
reckoned
great
among
them
believe
gave
wandering
about
and
minding
the
affairs
Men
and
Elves
some
time
ago
you
would
call
very
long
time
ago
and
settled
down
Angrenost
Isengard
the
Men
Rohan
call
was
very
quiet
begin
with
but
his
fame
began
grow
was
chosen
head
the
White
Council
they
say
but
that
did
not
turn
out
too
well
wonder
now
even
then
Saruman
was
not
turning
evil
ways
But
any
rate
used
give
trouble
his
neighbours
used
talk
him
There
was
time
when
was
always
walking
about
woods
was
polite
those
days
always
asking
leave
least
when
met
and
always
eager
listen
told
him
many
things
that
would
never
have
found
out
himself
but
never
repaid
like
kind
cannot
remember
that
ever
told
anything
And
got
more
and
more
like
that
his
face
remember
have
not
seen
for
many
day
became
like
windows
stone
wall
windows
with
shutters
inside
think
that
now
understand
what
plotting
become
Power
has
mind
metal
and
wheels
and
does
not
care
for
growing
things
except
far
they
serve
him
for
the
moment
And
now
clear
that
black
traitor
has
taken
with
foul
folk
with
the
Orcs
Brm
hoom
Worse
than
that
has
been
doing
something
them
something
dangerous
For
these
Isengarders
are
more
like
wicked
Men
mark
evil
things
that
came
the
Great
Darkness
that
they
cannot
abide
the
Sun
but
Saruman
Orcs
can
endure
even
they
hate
wonder
what
has
done
Are
they
Men
has
ruined
has
blended
the
races
Orcs
and
Men
That
would
black
evil
Treebeard
rumbled
for
moment
were
pronouncing
some
deep
subterranean
Entish
malediction
Some
time
ago
began
wonder
how
Orcs
dared
pass
through
woods
freely
went
Only
lately
did
guess
that
Saruman
was
blame
and
that
long
ago
had
been
spying
out
all
the
ways
and
discovering
secrets
and
his
foul
folk
are
making
havoc
now
Down
the
borders
they
are
felling
trees
good
trees
Some
the
trees
they
just
cut
down
and
leave
rot
orc
mischief
that
but
most
are
hewn
and
carried
off
feed
the
fires
Orthanc
There
always
smoke
rising
from
Isengard
these
days
Curse
him
root
and
branch
Many
those
trees
were
friends
creatures
had
known
from
nut
and
acorn
many
had
voices
their
own
that
are
lost
for
ever
now
And
there
are
wastes
stump
and
bramble
where
once
there
were
singing
groves
have
been
idle
have
let
things
slip
must
stop
Treebeard
raised
himself
from
his
bed
with
jerk
stood
and
thumped
his
hand
the
table
The
vessels
light
trembled
and
sent
two
jets
flame
There
was
flicker
like
green
fire
his
eyes
and
his
beard
stood
out
stiff
great
besom
will
stop
boomed
And
you
shall
come
with
You
may
able
help
You
will
helping
your
own
friends
that
way
too
for
Saruman
not
checked
Rohan
and
Gondor
will
have
enemy
behind
well
front
Our
roads
together
Isengard
will
come
with
you
said
Merry
will
what
can
Yes
said
Pippin
should
like
see
the
White
Hand
overthrown
should
like
there
even
could
not
much
use
shall
never
forget
Uglúk
and
the
crossing
Rohan
Good
Good
said
Treebeard
But
spoke
hastily
must
not
hasty
have
become
too
hot
must
cool
myself
and
think
fur
easier
shout
_stop_
than
strode
the
archway
and
stood
for
some
time
under
the
falling
rain
the
spring
Then
laughed
and
shook
himself
and
wherever
the
drops
water
fell
glittering
from
him
the
ground
they
glinted
like
red
and
green
sparks
came
back
and
laid
himself
the
bed
again
and
was
silent
After
some
time
the
hobbits
heard
him
murmuring
again
seemed
counting
his
fingers
Fangorn
Finglas
Fladrif
aye
aye
sighed
The
trouble
that
there
are
few
left
said
turning
towards
the
hobbits
Only
three
remain
the
first
Ents
that
walked
the
woods
before
the
Darkness
only
myself
Fangorn
and
Finglas
and
Fladrif
give
them
their
Elvish
names
you
may
call
them
Leaflock
and
Skinbark
you
like
that
better
And
three
Leaflock
and
Skinbark
are
not
much
use
for
this
business
Leaflock
has
grown
sleepy
almost
tree
ish
you
might
say
has
taken
standing
himself
half
asleep
all
through
the
summer
with
the
deep
grass
the
meadows
round
his
knees
Covered
with
leafy
hair
used
rouse
winter
but
late
has
been
too
drowsy
walk
far
even
then
Skinbark
lived
the
mountain
slopes
west
Isengard
That
where
the
worst
trouble
has
been
was
wounded
the
Orcs
and
many
his
folk
and
his
tree
herds
have
been
murdered
and
destroyed
has
gone
into
the
high
places
among
the
birches
that
loves
best
and
will
not
come
down
Still
daresay
could
get
together
fair
company
our
younger
folks
could
make
them
understand
the
need
could
rouse
them
are
not
hasty
folk
What
pity
there
are
few
Why
are
there
few
when
you
have
lived
this
country
long
asked
Pippin
Have
great
many
died
said
Treebeard
None
have
died
from
inside
you
might
say
Some
have
fallen
the
evil
chances
the
long
years
course
and
more
have
grown
tree
ish
But
there
were
never
many
and
have
not
increased
There
have
been
Entings
children
you
would
say
not
for
terrible
long
count
years
You
see
lost
the
Entwives
How
very
sad
said
Pippin
How
was
that
they
all
died
They
did
not
_die_
said
Treebeard
never
said
_died_
lost
them
said
lost
them
and
cannot
find
them
sighed
thought
most
folk
knew
that
There
were
songs
about
the
hunt
the
Ents
for
the
Entwives
sung
among
Elves
and
Men
from
Mirkwood
Gondor
They
cannot
quite
forgotten
Well
afraid
the
songs
have
not
come
west
over
the
Mountains
the
Shire
said
Merry
Won
you
tell
some
more
sing
one
the
songs
Yes
will
indeed
said
Treebeard
seeming
pleased
with
the
request
But
cannot
tell
properly
only
short
and
then
must
end
our
talk
tomorrow
have
councils
call
and
work
and
maybe
journey
begin
rather
strange
and
sad
story
went
after
pause
When
the
world
was
young
and
the
woods
were
wide
and
wild
the
Ents
and
the
Entwives
and
there
were
Entmaidens
then
the
loveliness
Fimbrethil
Wandlimb
the
lightfooted
the
days
our
youth
they
walked
together
and
they
housed
together
But
our
hearts
did
not
growing
the
same
way
the
Ents
gave
their
love
things
that
they
met
the
world
and
the
Entwives
gave
their
thought
other
things
for
the
Ents
loved
the
great
trees
and
the
wild
woods
and
the
slopes
the
high
hills
and
they
drank
the
mountain
streams
and
ate
only
such
fruit
the
trees
let
fall
their
path
and
they
learned
the
Elves
and
spoke
with
the
Trees
But
the
Entwives
gave
their
minds
the
lesser
trees
and
the
meads
the
sunshine
beyond
the
feet
the
forests
and
they
saw
the
sloe
the
thicket
and
the
wild
apple
and
the
cherry
blossoming
spring
and
the
green
herbs
the
waterlands
summer
and
the
seeding
grasses
the
autumn
fields
They
did
not
desire
speak
with
these
things
but
they
wished
them
hear
and
obey
what
was
said
them
The
Entwives
ordered
them
grow
according
their
wishes
and
bear
leaf
and
fruit
their
liking
for
the
Entwives
desired
order
and
plenty
and
peace
which
they
meant
that
things
should
remain
where
they
had
set
them
the
Entwives
made
gardens
live
But
Ents
went
wandering
and
only
came
the
gardens
now
and
again
Then
when
the
Darkness
came
the
North
the
Entwives
crossed
the
Great
River
and
made
new
gardens
and
tilled
new
fields
and
saw
them
more
seldom
After
the
Darkness
was
overthrown
the
land
the
Entwives
blossomed
richly
and
their
fields
were
full
corn
Many
men
learned
the
crafts
the
Entwives
and
honoured
them
greatly
but
were
only
legend
them
secret
the
heart
the
forest
Yet
here
still
are
while
all
the
gardens
the
Entwives
are
wasted
Men
call
them
the
Brown
Lands
now
remember
was
long
ago
the
time
the
war
between
Sauron
and
the
Men
the
Sea
desire
came
over
see
Fimbrethil
again
Very
fair
she
was
still
eyes
when
had
last
seen
her
though
little
like
the
Entmaiden
old
For
the
Entwives
were
bent
and
browned
their
labour
their
hair
parched
the
sun
the
hue
ripe
corn
and
their
cheeks
like
red
apples
Yet
their
eyes
were
still
the
eyes
our
own
people
crossed
over
Anduin
and
came
their
land
but
found
desert
was
all
burned
and
uprooted
for
war
had
passed
over
But
the
Entwives
were
not
there
Long
called
and
long
searched
and
asked
all
folk
that
met
which
way
the
Entwives
had
gone
Some
said
they
had
never
seen
them
and
some
said
that
they
had
seen
them
walking
away
west
and
some
said
east
and
others
south
But
nowhere
that
went
could
find
them
Our
sorrow
was
very
great
Yet
the
wild
wood
called
and
returned
For
many
years
used
out
every
now
and
again
and
look
for
the
Entwives
walking
far
and
wide
and
calling
them
their
beautiful
names
But
time
passed
went
more
seldom
and
wandered
less
far
And
now
the
Entwives
are
only
memory
for
and
our
beards
are
long
and
grey
The
Elves
made
many
songs
concerning
the
Search
the
Ents
and
some
the
songs
passed
into
the
tongues
Men
But
made
songs
about
being
content
chant
their
beautiful
names
when
thought
the
Entwives
believe
that
may
meet
again
time
come
and
perhaps
shall
find
somewhere
land
where
can
live
together
and
both
content
But
foreboded
that
that
will
only
when
have
both
lost
all
that
now
have
And
may
well
that
that
time
drawing
near
last
For
Sauron
old
destroyed
the
gardens
the
Enemy
today
seems
likely
wither
all
the
woods
There
was
Elvish
song
that
spoke
this
least
understand
used
sung
and
down
the
Great
River
was
never
Entish
song
mark
you
would
have
been
very
long
song
Entish
But
know
heart
and
hum
now
and
again
This
how
runs
your
tongue

Treebeard
ended
his
song
That
how
goes
said
Elvish
course
lighthearted
quickworded
and
soon
over
daresay
fair
enough
But
the
Ents
could
say
more
their
side
they
had
time
But
now
going
stand
and
take
little
sleep
Where
will
you
stand
usually
lie
down
sleep
said
Merry
shall
all
right
where
are
Lie
down
sleep
said
Treebeard
Why
course
you
hoom
was
forgetting
singing
that
song
put
mind
old
times
almost
thought
that
was
talking
young
Entings
did
Well
you
can
lie
the
bed
going
stand
the
rain
Good
night
Merry
and
Pippin
climbed
the
bed
and
curled
the
soft
grass
and
fern
was
fresh
and
sweet
scented
and
warm
The
lights
died
down
and
the
glow
the
trees
faded
but
outside
under
the
arch
they
could
see
old
Treebeard
standing
motionless
with
his
arms
raised
above
his
head
The
bright
stars
peered
out
the
sky
and
lit
the
falling
water
spilled
his
fingers
and
head
and
dripped
dripped
hundreds
silver
drops
his
feet
Listening
the
tinkling
the
drops
the
hobbits
fell
asleep
They
woke
find
cool
sun
shining
into
the
great
court
and
the
floor
the
bay
Shreds
high
cloud
were
overhead
running
stiff
easterly
wind
Treebeard
was
not
seen
but
while
Merry
and
Pippin
were
bathing
the
basin
the
arch
they
heard
him
humming
and
singing
came
the
path
between
the
trees
Hoo
Good
morning
Merry
and
Pippin
boomed
when
saw
them
You
sleep
long
have
been
many
hundred
strides
already
today
Now
will
have
drink
and
Entmoot
poured
them
out
two
full
bowls
from
stone
jar
but
from
different
jar
The
taste
was
not
the
same
had
been
the
night
before
was
earthier
and
richer
more
sustaining
and
food
like
speak
While
the
hobbits
drank
sitting
the
edge
the
bed
and
nibbling
small
pieces
elf
cake
more
because
they
felt
that
eating
was
necessary
part
breakfast
than
because
they
felt
hungry
Treebeard
stood
humming
Entish
Elvish
some
strange
tongue
and
looking
the
sky
Where
Entmoot
Pippin
ventured
ask
Hoo
Entmoot
said
Treebeard
turning
round
not
place
gathering
Ents
which
does
not
often
happen
nowadays
But
have
managed
make
fair
number
promise
come
shall
meet
the
place
where
have
always
met
Derndingle
Men
call
away
south
from
here
must
there
before
noon
Before
long
they
set
off
Treebeard
carried
the
hobbits
his
arms
the
previous
day
the
entrance
the
court
turned
the
right
stepped
over
the
stream
and
strode
away
southwards
along
the
feet
great
tumbled
slopes
where
trees
were
scanty
Above
these
the
hobbits
saw
thickets
birch
and
rowan
and
beyond
them
dark
climbing
pinewoods
Soon
Treebeard
turned
little
away
from
the
hills
and
plunged
into
deep
groves
where
the
trees
were
larger
taller
and
thicker
than
any
that
the
hobbits
had
ever
seen
before
For
while
they
felt
faintly
the
sense
stifling
which
they
had
noticed
when
they
first
ventured
into
Fangorn
but
soon
passed
Treebeard
did
not
talk
them
hummed
himself
deeply
and
thoughtfully
but
Merry
and
Pippin
caught
proper
words
sounded
like
_boom
boom
rumboom
boorar
boom
boom
dahrar
boom
boom
dahrar
boom_
and
with
constant
change
note
and
rhythm
Now
and
again
they
thought
they
heard
answer
hum
quiver
sound
that
seemed
come
out
the
earth
from
boughs
above
their
heads
perhaps
from
the
boles
the
trees
but
Treebeard
did
not
stop
turn
his
head
either
side
They
had
been
going
for
long
while
Pippin
had
tried
keep
count
the
ent
strides
but
had
failed
getting
lost
about
three
thousand
when
Treebeard
began
slacken
his
pace
Suddenly
stopped
put
the
hobbits
down
and
raised
his
curled
hands
his
mouth
that
they
made
hollow
tube
then
blew
called
through
them
great
_hoom
hom_
rang
out
like
deep
throated
horn
the
woods
and
seemed
echo
from
the
trees
Far
off
there
came
from
several
directions
similar
_hoom
hom
hoom_
that
was
not
echo
but
answer
Treebeard
now
perched
Merry
and
Pippin
his
shoulders
and
strode
again
every
now
and
then
sending
out
another
horn
call
and
each
time
the
answers
came
louder
and
nearer
this
way
they
came
last
what
looked
like
impenetrable
wall
dark
evergreen
trees
trees
kind
that
the
hobbits
had
never
seen
before
they
branched
out
right
from
the
roots
and
were
densely
clad
dark
glossy
leaves
like
thornless
holly
and
they
bore
many
stiff
upright
flower
spikes
with
large
shining
olive
coloured
buds
Turning
the
left
and
skirting
this
huge
hedge
Treebeard
came
few
strides
narrow
entrance
Through
worn
path
passed
and
dived
suddenly
down
long
steep
slope
The
hobbits
saw
that
they
were
descending
into
great
dingle
almost
round
bowl
very
wide
and
deep
crowned
the
rim
with
the
high
dark
evergreen
hedge
was
smooth
and
grassclad
inside
and
there
were
trees
except
three
very
tall
and
beautiful
silver
birches
that
stood
the
bottom
the
bowl
Two
other
paths
led
down
into
the
dingle
from
the
west
and
from
the
east
Several
Ents
had
already
arrived
More
were
coming
down
the
other
paths
and
some
were
now
following
Treebeard
they
drew
near
the
hobbits
gazed
them
They
had
expected
see
number
creatures
much
like
Treebeard
one
hobbit
like
another
any
rate
stranger
eye
and
they
were
very
much
surprised
see
nothing
the
kind
The
Ents
were
different
from
one
another
trees
from
trees
some
different
one
tree
from
another
the
same
name
but
quite
different
growth
and
history
and
some
different
one
tree
kind
from
another
birch
from
beech
oak
from
fir
There
were
few
older
Ents
bearded
and
gnarled
like
hale
but
ancient
trees
though
none
looked
ancient
Treebeard
and
there
were
tall
strong
Ents
clean
limbed
and
smooth
skinned
like
forest
trees
their
prime
but
there
were
young
Ents
saplings
Altogether
there
were
about
two
dozen
standing
the
wide
grassy
floor
the
dingle
and
many
more
were
marching
first
Merry
and
Pippin
were
struck
chiefly
the
variety
that
they
saw
the
many
shapes
and
colours
the
differences
girth
and
height
and
length
leg
and
arm
and
the
number
toes
and
fingers
anything
from
three
nine
few
seemed
more
less
related
Treebeard
and
reminded
them
beech
trees
oaks
But
there
were
other
kinds
Some
recalled
the
chestnut
brown
skinned
Ents
with
large
splayfingered
hands
and
short
thick
legs
Some
recalled
the
ash
tall
straight
grey
Ents
with
many
fingered
hands
and
long
legs
some
the
fir
the
tallest
Ents
and
others
the
birch
the
rowan
and
the
linden
But
when
the
Ents
all
gathered
round
Treebeard
bowing
their
heads
slightly
murmuring
their
slow
musical
voices
and
looking
long
and
intently
the
strangers
then
the
hobbits
saw
that
they
were
all
the
same
kindred
and
all
had
the
same
eyes
not
all
old
deep
Treebeard
but
all
with
the
same
slow
steady
thoughtful
expression
and
the
same
green
flicker
soon
the
whole
company
was
assembled
standing
wide
circle
round
Treebeard
curious
and
unintelligible
conversation
began
The
Ents
began
murmur
slowly
first
one
joined
and
then
another
until
they
were
all
chanting
together
long
rising
and
falling
rhythm
now
louder
one
side
the
ring
now
dying
away
there
and
rising
great
boom
the
other
side
Though
could
not
catch
understand
any
the
words
supposed
the
language
was
Entish
Pippin
found
the
sound
very
pleasant
listen
first
but
gradually
his
attention
wavered
After
long
time
and
the
chant
showed
signs
slackening
found
himself
wondering
since
Entish
was
such
unhasty
language
whether
they
had
yet
got
further
than
_Good
Morning_
and
Treebeard
was
call
the
roll
how
many
days
would
take
sing
all
their
names
wonder
what
the
Entish
for
_yes_
_no_
thought
yawned
Treebeard
was
immediately
aware
him
_Hm
hey_
Pippin
said
and
the
other
Ents
all
stopped
their
chant
You
are
hasty
folk
was
forgetting
and
anyway
wearisome
listening
speech
you
not
understand
You
may
get
down
now
have
told
your
names
the
Entmoot
and
they
have
seen
you
and
they
have
agreed
that
you
are
not
Orcs
and
that
new
line
shall
put
the
old
lists
have
got
further
yet
but
that
quick
work
for
Entmoot
You
and
Merry
can
stroll
about
the
dingle
you
like
There
well
good
water
you
need
refreshing
away
yonder
the
north
bank
There
are
still
some
words
speak
before
the
Moot
really
begins
will
come
and
see
you
again
and
tell
you
how
things
are
going
put
the
hobbits
down
Before
they
walked
away
they
bowed
low
This
feat
seemed
amuse
the
Ents
very
much
judge
the
tone
their
murmurs
and
the
flicker
their
eyes
but
they
soon
turned
back
their
own
business
Merry
and
Pippin
climbed
the
path
that
came
from
the
west
and
looked
through
the
opening
the
great
hedge
Long
tree
clad
slopes
rose
from
the
lip
the
dingle
and
away
beyond
them
above
the
fir
trees
the
furthest
ridge
there
rose
sharp
and
white
the
peak
high
mountain
Southwards
their
left
they
could
see
the
forest
falling
away
down
into
the
grey
distance
There
far
away
there
was
pale
green
glimmer
that
Merry
guessed
glimpse
the
plains
Rohan
wonder
where
Isengard
said
Pippin
don
know
quite
where
are
said
Merry
but
that
peak
probably
Methedras
and
far
can
remember
the
ring
Isengard
lies
fork
deep
cleft
the
end
the
mountains
probably
down
behind
this
great
ridge
There
seems
smoke
haze
over
there
left
the
peak
don
you
think
What
Isengard
like
said
Pippin
wonder
what
Ents
can
about
anyway
said
Merry
Isengard
sort
ring
rocks
hills
think
with
flat
space
inside
and
island
pillar
rock
the
middle
called
Orthanc
Saruman
has
tower
There
gate
perhaps
more
than
one
the
encircling
wall
and
believe
there
stream
running
through
comes
out
the
mountains
and
flows
across
the
Gap
Rohan
does
not
seem
the
sort
place
for
Ents
tackle
But
have
odd
feeling
about
these
Ents
somehow
don
think
they
are
quite
safe
and
well
funny
they
seem
They
seem
slow
queer
and
patient
almost
sad
and
yet
believe
they
_could_
roused
that
happened
would
rather
not
the
other
side
Yes
said
Pippin
know
what
you
mean
There
might
all
the
difference
between
old
cow
sitting
and
thoughtfully
chewing
and
bull
charging
and
the
change
might
come
suddenly
wonder
Treebeard
will
rouse
them
sure
means
try
But
they
don
like
being
roused
Treebeard
got
roused
himself
last
night
and
then
bottled
again
The
hobbits
turned
back
The
voices
the
Ents
were
still
rising
and
falling
their
conclave
The
sun
had
now
risen
high
enough
look
over
the
high
hedge
gleamed
the
tops
the
birches
and
lit
the
northward
side
the
dingle
with
cool
yellow
light
There
they
saw
little
glittering
fountain
They
walked
along
the
rim
the
great
bowl
the
feet
the
evergreens
was
pleasant
feel
cool
grass
about
their
toes
again
and
not
hurry
and
then
they
climbed
down
the
gushing
water
They
drank
little
clean
cold
sharp
draught
and
sat
down
mossy
stone
watching
the
patches
sun
the
grass
and
the
shadows
the
sailing
clouds
passing
over
the
floor
the
dingle
The
murmur
the
Ents
went
seemed
very
strange
and
remote
place
outside
their
world
and
far
from
everything
that
had
ever
happened
them
great
longing
came
over
them
for
the
faces
and
voices
their
companions
especially
for
Frodo
and
Sam
and
for
Strider
last
there
came
pause
the
Ent
voices
and
looking
they
saw
Treebeard
coming
towards
them
with
another
Ent
his
side
hoom
here
again
said
Treebeard
Are
you
getting
weary
feeling
impatient
hmm
Well
afraid
that
you
must
not
get
impatient
yet
have
finished
the
first
stage
now
but
have
still
got
explain
things
again
those
that
live
long
way
off
far
from
Isengard
and
those
that
could
not
get
round
before
the
Moot
and
after
that
shall
have
decide
what
However
deciding
what
does
not
take
Ents
long
going
over
all
the
facts
and
events
that
they
have
make
their
minds
about
Still
use
denying
shall
here
long
time
yet
couple
days
very
likely
have
brought
you
companion
has
ent
house
nearby
Bregalad
his
Elvish
name
says
has
already
made
his
mind
and
does
not
need
remain
the
Moot
the
nearest
thing
among
hasty
Ent
You
ought
get
together
Good
bye
Treebeard
turned
and
left
them
Bregalad
stood
for
some
time
surveying
the
hobbits
solemnly
and
they
looked
him
wondering
when
would
show
any
signs
hastiness
was
tall
and
seemed
one
the
younger
Ents
had
smooth
shining
skin
his
arms
and
legs
his
lips
were
ruddy
and
his
hair
was
grey
green
could
bend
and
sway
like
slender
tree
the
wind
last
spoke
and
his
voice
though
resonant
was
higher
and
clearer
than
Treebeard
hmm
friends
let
for
walk
said
Bregalad
that
Quickbeam
your
language
But
only
nickname
course
They
have
called
that
ever
since
said
_yes_
elder
Ent
before
had
finished
his
question
Also
drink
quickly
and
out
while
some
are
still
wetting
their
beards
Come
with
reached
down
two
shapely
arms
and
gave
long
fingered
hand
each
the
hobbits
All
that
day
they
walked
about
the
woods
with
him
singing
and
laughing
for
Quickbeam
often
laughed
laughed
the
sun
came
out
from
behind
cloud
laughed
they
came
upon
stream
spring
then
stooped
and
splashed
his
feet
and
head
with
water
laughed
sometimes
some
sound
whisper
the
trees
Whenever
saw
rowan
tree
halted
while
with
his
arms
stretched
out
and
sang
and
swayed
sang
nightfall
brought
them
his
ent
house
nothing
more
than
mossy
stone
set
upon
turves
under
green
bank
Rowan
trees
grew
circle
about
and
there
was
water
all
ent
houses
spring
bubbling
out
from
the
bank
They
talked
for
while
darkness
fell
the
forest
Not
far
away
the
voices
the
Entmoot
could
heard
still
going
but
now
they
seemed
deeper
and
less
leisurely
and
every
now
and
again
one
great
voice
would
rise
high
and
quickening
music
while
all
the
others
died
away
But
beside
them
Bregalad
spoke
gently
their
own
tongue
almost
whispering
and
they
learned
that
belonged
Skinbark
people
and
the
country
where
they
had
lived
had
been
ravaged
That
seemed
the
hobbits
quite
enough
explain
his
hastiness
least
the
matter
Orcs
There
were
rowan
trees
home
said
Bregalad
softly
and
sadly
rowan
trees
that
took
root
when
was
Enting
many
many
years
ago
the
quiet
the
world
The
oldest
were
planted
the
Ents
try
and
please
the
Entwives
but
they
looked
them
and
smiled
and
said
that
they
knew
where
whiter
blossom
and
richer
fruit
were
growing
Yet
there
are
trees
all
that
race
the
people
the
Rose
that
are
beautiful
And
these
trees
grew
and
grew
till
the
shadow
each
was
like
green
hall
and
their
red
berries
the
autumn
were
burden
and
beauty
and
wonder
Birds
used
flock
there
like
birds
even
when
they
chatter
and
the
rowan
has
enough
and
spare
But
the
birds
became
unfriendly
and
greedy
and
tore
the
trees
and
threw
the
fruit
down
and
did
not
eat
Then
Orcs
came
with
axes
and
cut
down
trees
came
and
called
them
their
long
names
but
they
did
not
quiver
they
did
not
hear
answer
they
lay
dead

fair
upon
your

how
white
the

lay

saw
you

upon
summer

Your

your

light
your

cool
and
soft
Upon
your

how
golden
red
the

you
bore
aloft

dead
upon
your

your

dry
and
grey
Your

spilled
your

stilled
for
ever
and

The
hobbits
fell
asleep
the
sound
the
soft
singing
Bregalad
that
seemed
lament
many
tongues
the
fall
trees
that
had
loved
The
next
day
they
spent
also
his
company
but
they
did
not
far
from
his
house
Most
the
time
they
sat
silent
under
the
shelter
the
bank
for
the
wind
was
colder
and
the
clouds
closer
and
greyer
there
was
little
sunshine
and
the
distance
the
voices
the
Ents
the
Moot
still
rose
and
fell
sometimes
loud
and
strong
sometimes
low
and
sad
sometimes
quickening
sometimes
slow
and
solemn
dirge
second
night
came
and
still
the
Ents
held
conclave
under
hurrying
clouds
and
fitful
stars
The
third
day
broke
bleak
and
windy
sunrise
the
Ents
voices
rose
great
clamour
and
then
died
down
again
the
morning
wore
the
wind
fell
and
the
air
grew
heavy
with
expectancy
The
hobbits
could
see
that
Bregalad
was
now
listening
intently
although
them
down
the
dell
his
ent
house
the
sound
the
Moot
was
faint
The
afternoon
came
and
the
sun
going
west
towards
the
mountains
sent
out
long
yellow
beams
between
the
cracks
and
fissures
the
clouds
Suddenly
they
were
aware
that
everything
was
very
quiet
the
whole
forest
stood
listening
silence
course
the
Ent
voices
had
stopped
What
did
that
mean
Bregalad
was
standing
erect
and
tense
looking
back
northwards
towards
Derndingle
Then
with
crash
came
great
ringing
shout
_ra
hoom
rah
The
trees
quivered
and
bent
gust
had
struck
them
There
was
another
pause
and
then
marching
music
began
like
solemn
drums
and
above
the
rolling
beats
and
booms
there
welled
voices
singing
high
and
strong
come
come
with
roll
drum
runda
runda
runda
rom
The
Ents
were
coming
ever
nearer
and
louder
rose
their
song
come
come
with
horn
and
drum
rûna
rûna
rûna
rom
Bregalad
picked
the
hobbits
and
strode
from
his
house
Before
long
they
saw
the
marching
line
approaching
the
Ents
were
swinging
along
with
great
strides
down
the
slope
towards
them
Treebeard
was
their
head
and
some
fifty
followers
were
behind
him
two
abreast
keeping
step
with
their
feet
and
beating
time
with
their
hands
upon
their
flanks
they
drew
near
the
flash
and
flicker
their
eyes
could
seen
Hoom
hom
Here
come
with
boom
here
come
last
called
Treebeard
when
caught
sight
Bregalad
and
the
hobbits
Come
join
the
Moot
are
off
are
off
Isengard
Isengard
the
Ents
cried
many
voices
Isengard
Isengard
Though
Isengard
ringed
and
barred
with
doors
stone
Though
Isengard
strong
and
hard
cold
stone
and
bare
bone
war
hew
the
stone
and
break
the
door
For
bole
and
bough
are
burning
now
the
furnace
roars
war
land
gloom
with
tramp
doom
with
roll
drum
come
come
Isengard
with
doom
come
With
doom
come
with
doom
come
they
sang
they
marched
southwards
Bregalad
his
eyes
shining
swung
into
the
line
beside
Treebeard
The
old
Ent
now
took
the
hobbits
back
and
set
them
his
shoulders
again
and
they
rode
proudly
the
head
the
singing
company
with
beating
hearts
and
heads
held
high
Though
they
had
expected
something
happen
eventually
they
were
amazed
the
change
that
had
come
over
the
Ents
seemed
now
sudden
the
bursting
flood
that
had
long
been
held
back
dike
The
Ents
made
their
minds
rather
quickly
after
all
didn
they
Pippin
ventured
say
after
some
time
when
for
moment
the
singing
paused
and
only
the
beating
hands
and
feet
was
heard
Quickly
said
Treebeard
Hoom
Yes
indeed
Quicker
than
expected
Indeed
have
not
seen
them
roused
like
this
for
many
age
Ents
not
like
being
roused
and
never
are
roused
unless
clear
that
our
trees
and
our
lives
are
great
danger
That
has
not
happened
this
Forest
since
the
wars
Sauron
and
the
Men
the
Sea
the
orc
work
the
wanton
hewing
_rárum_
without
even
the
bad
excuse
feeding
the
fires
that
has
angered
and
the
treachery
neighbour
who
should
have
helped
Wizards
ought
know
better
they
know
better
There
curse
Elvish
Entish
the
tongues
Men
bad
enough
for
such
treachery
Down
with
Saruman
Will
you
really
break
the
doors
Isengard
asked
Merry
well
could
you
know
You
not
know
perhaps
how
strong
are
Maybe
you
have
heard
Trolls
They
are
mighty
strong
But
Trolls
are
only
counterfeits
made
the
Enemy
the
Great
Darkness
mockery
Ents
Orcs
were
Elves
are
stronger
than
Trolls
are
made
the
bones
the
earth
can
split
stone
like
the
roots
trees
only
quicker
far
quicker
our
minds
are
roused
are
not
hewn
down
destroyed
fire
blast
sorcery
could
split
Isengard
into
splinters
and
crack
its
walls
into
rubble
But
Saruman
will
try
stop
you
won
yes
that
have
not
forgotten
Indeed
have
thought
long
about
But
you
see
many
the
Ents
are
younger
than
many
lives
trees
They
are
all
roused
now
and
their
mind
all
one
thing
breaking
Isengard
But
they
will
start
thinking
again
before
long
they
will
cool
down
little
when
take
our
evening
drink
What
thirst
shall
have
But
let
them
march
now
and
sing
have
long
way
and
there
time
ahead
for
thought
something
have
started
Treebeard
marched
singing
with
the
others
for
while
But
after
time
his
voice
died
murmur
and
fell
silent
again
Pippin
could
see
that
his
old
brow
was
wrinkled
and
knotted
last
looked
and
Pippin
could
see
sad
look
his
eyes
sad
but
not
unhappy
There
was
light
them
the
green
flame
had
sunk
deeper
into
the
dark
wells
his
thought
course
likely
enough
friends
said
slowly
likely
enough
that
are
going
our
doom
the
last
march
the
Ents
But
stayed
home
and
did
nothing
doom
would
find
anyway
sooner
later
That
thought
has
long
been
growing
our
hearts
and
that
why
are
marching
now
was
not
hasty
resolve
Now
least
the
last
march
the
Ents
may
worth
song
Aye
sighed
may
help
the
other
peoples
before
pass
away
Still
should
have
liked
see
the
songs
come
true
about
the
Entwives
should
dearly
have
liked
see
Fimbrethil
again
But
there
friends
songs
like
trees
bear
fruit
only
their
own
time
and
their
own
way
and
sometimes
they
are
withered
untimely
The
Ents
went
striding
great
pace
They
had
descended
into
long
fold
the
land
that
fell
away
southward
now
they
began
climb
and
the
high
western
ridge
The
woods
fell
away
and
they
came
scattered
groups
birch
and
then
bare
slopes
where
only
few
gaunt
pine
trees
grew
The
sun
sank
behind
the
dark
hill
back
front
Grey
dusk
fell
Pippin
looked
behind
The
number
the
Ents
had
grown
what
was
happening
Where
the
dim
bare
slopes
that
they
had
crossed
should
lie
thought
saw
groves
trees
But
they
were
moving
Could
that
the
trees
Fangorn
were
awake
and
the
forest
was
rising
marching
over
the
hills
war
rubbed
his
eyes
wondering
sleep
and
shadow
had
deceived
him
but
the
great
grey
shapes
moved
steadily
onward
There
was
noise
like
wind
many
branches
The
Ents
were
drawing
near
the
crest
the
ridge
now
and
all
song
had
ceased
Night
fell
and
there
was
silence
nothing
was
heard
save
faint
quiver
the
earth
beneath
the
feet
the
Ents
and
rustle
the
shade
whisper
many
drifting
leaves
last
they
stood
upon
the
summit
and
looked
down
into
dark
pit
the
great
cleft
the
end
the
mountains
Nan
Curunír
the
Valley
Saruman
Night
lies
over
Isengard
said
Treebeard
_Chapter
The
White
Rider
very
bones
are
chilled
said
Gimli
flapping
his
arms
and
stamping
his
feet
Day
had
come
last
dawn
the
companions
had
made
such
breakfast
they
could
now
the
growing
light
they
were
getting
ready
search
the
ground
again
for
signs
the
hobbits
And
not
forget
that
old
man
said
Gimli
should
happier
could
see
the
print
boot
Why
would
that
make
you
happy
said
Legolas
Because
old
man
with
feet
that
leave
marks
might
more
than
seemed
answered
the
Dwarf
Maybe
said
the
Elf
but
heavy
boot
might
leave
print
here
the
grass
deep
and
springy
That
would
not
baffle
Ranger
said
Gimli
bent
blade
enough
for
Aragorn
read
But
not
expect
him
find
any
traces
was
evil
phantom
Saruman
that
saw
last
night
sure
even
under
the
light
morning
His
eyes
are
looking
out
from
Fangorn
even
now
maybe
likely
enough
said
Aragorn
yet
not
sure
thinking
the
horses
You
said
last
night
Gimli
that
they
were
scared
away
But
did
not
think
Did
you
hear
them
Legolas
Did
they
sound
you
like
beasts
terror
said
Legolas
heard
them
clearly
But
for
the
darkness
and
our
own
fear
should
have
guessed
that
they
were
beasts
wild
with
some
sudden
gladness
They
spoke
horses
will
when
they
meet
friend
that
they
have
long
missed
thought
said
Aragorn
but
cannot
read
the
riddle
unless
they
return
Come
The
light
growing
fast
Let
look
first
and
guess
later
should
begin
here
near
our
own
camping
ground
searching
carefully
all
about
and
working
the
slope
towards
the
forest
find
the
hobbits
our
errand
whatever
may
think
our
visitor
the
night
they
escaped
some
chance
then
they
must
have
hidden
the
trees
they
would
have
been
seen
find
nothing
between
here
and
the
eaves
the
wood
then
will
make
last
search
upon
the
battle
field
and
among
the
ashes
But
there
little
hope
there
the
horsemen
Rohan
did
their
work
too
well
For
some
time
the
companions
crawled
and
groped
upon
the
ground
The
tree
stood
mournfully
above
them
its
dry
leaves
now
hanging
limp
and
rattling
the
chill
easterly
wind
Aragorn
moved
slowly
away
came
the
ashes
the
watch
fire
near
the
river
bank
and
then
began
retrace
the
ground
back
towards
the
knoll
where
the
battle
had
been
fought
Suddenly
stooped
and
bent
low
with
his
face
almost
the
grass
Then
called
the
others
They
came
running
Here
last
find
news
said
Aragorn
lifted
broken
leaf
for
them
see
large
pale
leaf
golden
hue
now
fading
and
turning
brown
Here
mallorn
leaf
Lórien
and
there
are
small
crumbs
and
few
more
crumbs
the
grass
And
see
there
are
some
pieces
cut
cord
lying
nearby
And
here
the
knife
that
cut
them
said
Gimli
stooped
and
drew
out
tussock
into
which
some
heavy
foot
had
trampled
short
jagged
blade
The
haft
from
which
had
been
snapped
was
beside
was
orc
weapon
said
holding
gingerly
and
looking
with
disgust
the
carved
handle
had
been
shaped
like
hideous
head
with
squinting
eyes
and
leering
mouth
Well
here
the
strangest
riddle
that
have
yet
found
exclaimed
Legolas
bound
prisoner
escapes
both
from
the
Orcs
and
from
the
surrounding
horsemen
then
stops
while
still
the
open
and
cuts
his
bonds
with
orc
knife
But
how
and
why
For
his
legs
were
tied
how
did
walk
And
his
arms
were
tied
how
did
use
the
knife
And
neither
were
tied
why
did
cut
the
cords
all
Being
pleased
with
his
skill
then
sat
down
and
quietly
ate
some
waybread
That
least
enough
show
that
was
hobbit
without
the
mallorn
leaf
After
that
suppose
turned
his
arms
into
wings
and
flew
away
singing
into
the
trees
should
easy
find
him
only
need
wings
ourselves
There
was
sorcery
here
right
enough
said
Gimli
What
was
that
old
man
doing
What
have
you
say
Aragorn
the
reading
Legolas
Can
you
better
Maybe
could
said
Aragorn
smiling
There
are
some
other
signs
near
hand
that
you
have
not
considered
agree
that
the
prisoner
was
hobbit
and
must
have
had
either
legs
hands
free
before
came
here
guess
that
was
hands
because
the
riddle
then
becomes
easier
and
also
because
read
the
marks
was
_carried_
this
point
Orc
Blood
was
spilled
there
few
paces
away
orc
blood
There
are
deep
prints
hoofs
all
about
this
spot
and
signs
that
heavy
thing
was
dragged
away
The
Orc
was
slain
horsemen
and
later
his
body
was
hauled
the
fire
But
the
hobbit
was
not
seen
was
not
the
open
for
was
night
and
still
had
his
elven
cloak
was
exhausted
and
hungry
and
not
wondered
that
when
had
cut
his
bonds
with
the
knife
his
fallen
enemy
rested
and
ate
little
before
crept
away
But
comfort
know
that
had
some
_lembas_
his
pocket
even
though
ran
away
without
gear
pack
that
perhaps
like
hobbit
say
_he_
though
hope
and
guess
that
both
Merry
and
Pippin
were
here
together
There
however
nothing
show
that
for
certain
And
how
you
suppose
that
either
our
friends
came
have
hand
free
asked
Gimli
not
know
how
happened
answered
Aragorn
Nor
know
why
Orc
was
carrying
them
away
Not
help
them
escape
may
sure
Nay
rather
think
that
now
begin
understand
matter
that
has
puzzled
from
the
beginning
why
when
Boromir
had
fallen
were
the
Orcs
content
with
the
capture
Merry
and
Pippin
They
did
not
seek
out
the
rest
nor
attack
our
camp
but
instead
they
went
with
all
speed
towards
Isengard
Did
they
suppose
they
had
captured
the
Ring
bearer
and
his
faithful
comrade
think
not
Their
masters
would
not
dare
give
such
plain
orders
Orcs
even
they
knew
much
themselves
they
would
not
speak
openly
them
the
Ring
they
are
not
trusty
servants
But
think
the
Orcs
had
been
commanded
capture
_hobbits_
alive
all
costs
attempt
was
made
slip
out
with
the
precious
prisoners
before
the
battle
Treachery
perhaps
likely
enough
with
such
folk
some
large
and
bold
Orc
may
have
been
trying
escape
with
the
prize
alone
for
his
own
ends
There
that
tale
Others
might
devised
But
this
may
count
any
case
one
least
our
friends
escaped
our
task
find
him
and
help
him
before
return
Rohan
must
not
daunted
Fangorn
since
need
drove
him
into
that
dark
place
not
know
which
daunts
more
Fangorn
the
thought
the
long
road
through
Rohan
foot
said
Gimli
Then
let
the
forest
said
Aragorn
was
not
long
before
Aragorn
found
fresh
signs
one
point
near
the
bank
the
Entwash
came
upon
footprints
hobbit
prints
but
too
light
for
much
made
them
Then
again
beneath
the
bole
great
tree
the
very
edge
the
wood
more
prints
were
discovered
The
earth
was
bare
and
dry
and
did
not
reveal
much
One
hobbit
least
stood
here
for
while
and
looked
back
and
then
turned
away
into
the
forest
said
Aragorn
Then
must
too
said
Gimli
But
not
like
the
look
this
Fangorn
and
were
warned
against
wish
the
chase
had
led
anywhere
else
not
think
the
wood
feels
evil
whatever
tales
may
say
said
Legolas
stood
under
the
eaves
the
forest
stooping
forward
were
listening
and
peering
with
wide
eyes
into
the
shadows
not
evil
what
evil
far
away
catch
only
the
faintest
echoes
dark
places
where
the
hearts
the
trees
are
black
There
malice
near
but
there
watchfulness
and
anger
Well
has
cause
angry
with
said
Gimli
have
done
harm
That
just
well
said
Legolas
But
nonetheless
has
suffered
harm
There
something
happening
inside
going
happen
you
not
feel
the
tenseness
takes
breath
feel
the
air
stuffy
said
the
Dwarf
This
wood
lighter
than
Mirkwood
but
musty
and
shabby
old
very
old
said
the
Elf
old
that
almost
feel
young
again
have
not
felt
since
journeyed
with
you
children
old
and
full
memory
could
have
been
happy
here
had
come
days
peace
dare
say
you
could
snorted
Gimli
You
are
Wood
elf
anyway
though
Elves
any
kind
are
strange
folk
Yet
you
comfort
Where
you
will
But
keep
your
bow
ready
hand
and
will
keep
axe
loose
belt
Not
for
use
trees
added
hastily
looking
the
tree
under
which
they
stood
not
wish
meet
that
old
man
unawares
without
argument
ready
hand
that
all
Let
With
that
the
three
hunters
plunged
into
the
forest
Fangorn
Legolas
and
Gimli
left
the
tracking
Aragorn
There
was
little
for
him
see
The
floor
the
forest
was
dry
and
covered
with
drift
leaves
but
guessing
that
the
fugitives
would
stay
near
the
water
returned
often
the
banks
the
stream
was
that
came
upon
the
place
where
Merry
and
Pippin
had
drunk
and
bathed
their
feet
There
plain
for
all
see
were
the
footprints
two
hobbits
one
somewhat
smaller
than
the
other
This
good
tidings
said
Aragorn
Yet
the
marks
are
two
days
old
And
seems
that
this
point
the
hobbits
left
the
water
side
Then
what
shall
now
said
Gimli
cannot
pursue
them
through
the
whole
fastness
Fangorn
have
come
ill
supplied
not
find
them
soon
shall
use
them
except
sit
down
beside
them
and
show
our
friendship
starving
together
that
indeed
all
can
then
must
that
said
Aragorn
Let
They
came
length
the
steep
abrupt
end
Treebeard
Hill
and
looked
the
rock
wall
with
its
rough
steps
leading
the
high
shelf
Gleams
sun
were
striking
through
the
hurrying
clouds
and
the
forest
now
looked
less
grey
and
drear
Let
and
look
about
said
Legolas
will
feel
breath
short
should
like
taste
freer
air
for
while
The
companions
climbed
Aragorn
came
last
moving
slowly
was
scanning
the
steps
and
ledges
closely
almost
sure
that
the
hobbits
have
been
here
said
But
there
are
other
marks
very
strange
marks
which
not
understand
wonder
can
see
anything
from
this
ledge
which
will
help
guess
which
way
they
went
next
stood
and
looked
about
but
saw
nothing
that
was
any
use
The
shelf
faced
southward
and
eastward
but
only
the
east
was
the
view
open
There
could
see
the
heads
the
trees
descending
ranks
towards
the
plain
from
which
they
had
come
have
journeyed
long
way
round
said
Legolas
could
have
all
come
here
safe
together
had
left
the
Great
River
the
second
third
day
and
struck
west
Few
can
foresee
whither
their
road
will
lead
them
till
they
come
its
end
But
did
not
wish
come
Fangorn
said
Gimli
Yet
here
are
and
nicely
caught
the
net
said
Legolas
Look
Look
what
said
Gimli
There
the
trees
Where
have
not
elf
eyes
Hush
Speak
more
softly
Look
said
Legolas
pointing
Down
the
wood
back
the
Way
that
have
just
come
Cannot
you
see
him
passing
from
tree
tree
see
see
now
hissed
Gimli
Look
Aragorn
Did
not
warn
you
There
the
old
man
All
dirty
grey
rags
that
why
could
not
see
him
first
Aragorn
looked
and
beheld
bent
figure
moving
slowly
was
not
far
away
looked
like
old
beggar
man
walking
wearily
leaning
rough
staff
His
head
was
bowed
and
did
not
look
towards
them
other
lands
they
would
have
greeted
him
with
kind
words
but
now
they
stood
silent
each
feeling
strange
expectancy
something
was
approaching
that
held
hidden
power
menace
Gimli
gazed
with
wide
eyes
for
while
step
step
the
figure
drew
nearer
Then
suddenly
unable
contain
himself
longer
burst
out
Your
bow
Legolas
Bend
Get
ready
Saruman
not
let
him
speak
put
spell
upon
Shoot
first
Legolas
took
his
bow
and
bent
slowly
and
some
other
will
resisted
him
held
arrow
loosely
his
hand
but
did
not
fit
the
string
Aragorn
stood
silent
his
face
was
watchful
and
intent
Why
are
you
waiting
What
the
matter
with
you
said
Gimli
hissing
whisper
Legolas
right
said
Aragorn
quietly
may
not
shoot
old
man
unawares
and
unchallenged
whatever
fear
doubt
Watch
and
wait
that
moment
the
old
man
quickened
his
pace
and
came
with
surprising
speed
the
foot
the
rock
wall
Then
suddenly
looked
while
they
stood
motionless
looking
down
There
was
sound
They
could
not
see
his
face
was
hooded
and
above
the
hood
wore
wide
brimmed
hat
that
all
his
features
were
over
shadowed
except
for
the
end
his
nose
and
his
grey
beard
Yet
seemed
Aragorn
that
caught
the
gleam
eyes
keen
and
bright
from
within
the
shadow
the
hooded
brows
last
the
old
man
broke
the
silence
Well
met
indeed
friends
said
soft
voice
wish
speak
you
Will
you
come
down
shall
come
Without
waiting
for
answer
began
climb
Now
said
Gimli
Stop
him
Legolas
Did
not
say
that
wished
speak
you
said
the
old
man
Put
away
that
bow
Master
Elf
The
bow
and
arrow
fell
from
Legolas
hands
and
his
arms
hung
loose
his
sides
And
you
Master
Dwarf
pray
take
your
hand
from
your
axe
haft
till
You
will
not
need
such
arguments
Gimli
started
and
then
stood
still
stone
staring
while
the
old
man
sprang
the
rough
steps
nimbly
goat
All
weariness
seemed
have
left
him
stepped
the
shelf
there
was
gleam
too
brief
for
certainty
quick
glint
white
some
garment
shrouded
the
grey
rags
had
been
for
instant
revealed
The
intake
Gimli
breath
could
heard
loud
hiss
the
silence
Well
met
say
again
said
the
old
man
coming
towards
them
When
was
few
feet
away
stood
stooping
over
his
staff
with
his
head
thrust
forward
peering
them
from
under
his
hood
And
what
may
you
doing
these
parts
Elf
Man
and
Dwarf
all
clad
elvish
fashion
doubt
there
tale
worth
hearing
behind
all
Such
things
are
not
often
seen
here
You
speak
one
that
knows
Fangorn
well
said
Aragorn
that
Not
well
said
the
old
man
that
would
the
study
many
lives
But
come
here
now
and
again
Might
know
your
name
and
then
hear
what
that
you
have
say
said
Aragorn
The
morning
passes
and
have
errand
that
will
not
wait
for
what
wished
say
have
said
What
may
you
doing
and
what
tale
can
you
tell
yourselves
for
name
broke
off
laughing
long
and
softly
Aragorn
felt
shudder
run
through
him
the
sound
strange
cold
thrill
and
yet
was
not
fear
terror
that
felt
rather
was
like
the
sudden
bite
keen
air
the
slap
cold
rain
that
wakes
uneasy
sleeper
name
said
the
old
man
again
Have
you
not
guessed
already
You
have
heard
before
think
Yes
you
have
heard
before
But
come
now
what
your
tale
The
three
companions
stood
silent
and
made
answer
There
are
some
who
would
begin
doubt
whether
your
errand
fit
tell
said
the
old
man
Happily
know
something
You
are
tracking
the
footsteps
two
young
hobbits
believe
Yes
hobbits
Don
stare
you
had
never
heard
the
strange
name
before
You
have
and
have
Well
they
climbed
here
the
day
before
yesterday
and
they
met
someone
that
they
did
not
expect
Does
that
comfort
you
And
now
you
would
like
know
where
they
were
taken
Well
well
maybe
can
give
you
some
news
about
that
But
why
are
standing
Your
errand
you
see
longer
urgent
you
thought
Let
sit
down
and
more
ease
The
old
man
turned
away
and
went
towards
heap
fallen
stones
and
rock
the
foot
the
cliff
behind
Immediately
spell
had
been
removed
the
others
relaxed
and
stirred
Gimli
hand
went
once
his
axe
haft
Aragorn
drew
his
sword
Legolas
picked
his
bow
The
old
man
took
notice
but
stooped
and
sat
himself
low
flat
stone
Then
his
grey
cloak
drew
apart
and
they
saw
beyond
doubt
that
was
clothed
beneath
all
white
Saruman
cried
Gimli
springing
towards
him
with
axe
hand
speak
Tell
where
you
have
hidden
our
friends
What
have
you
done
with
them
Speak
will
make
dint
your
hat
that
even
wizard
will
find
hard
deal
with
The
old
man
was
too
quick
for
him
sprang
his
feet
and
leaped
the
top
large
rock
There
stood
grown
suddenly
tall
towering
above
them
His
hood
and
his
grey
rags
were
flung
away
His
white
garments
shone
lifted
his
staff
and
Gimli
axe
leaped
from
his
grasp
and
fell
ringing
the
ground
The
sword
Aragorn
stiff
his
motionless
hand
blazed
with
sudden
fire
Legolas
gave
great
shout
and
shot
arrow
high
into
the
air
vanished
flash
flame
Mithrandir
cried
Mithrandir
Well
met
say
you
again
Legolas
said
the
old
man
They
all
gazed
him
His
hair
was
white
snow
the
sunshine
and
gleaming
white
was
his
robe
the
eyes
under
his
deep
brows
were
bright
piercing
the
rays
the
sun
power
was
his
hand
Between
wonder
joy
and
fear
they
stood
and
found
words
say
last
Aragorn
stirred
Gandalf
said
Beyond
all
hope
you
return
our
need
What
veil
was
over
sight
Gandalf
Gimli
said
nothing
hut
sank
his
knees
shading
his
eyes
Gandalf
the
old
man
repeated
recalling
from
old
memory
long
disused
word
Yes
that
was
the
name
was
Gandalf
stepped
down
from
the
rock
and
picking
his
grey
cloak
wrapped
about
him
seemed
the
sun
had
been
shining
but
now
was
hid
cloud
again
Yes
you
may
still
call
Gandalf
said
and
the
voice
was
the
voice
their
old
friend
and
guide
Get
good
Gimli
blame
you
and
harm
done
Indeed
friends
none
you
have
any
weapon
that
could
hurt
merry
meet
again
the
turn
the
tide
The
great
storm
coming
but
the
tide
has
turned
laid
his
hand
Gimli
head
and
the
Dwarf
looked
and
laughed
suddenly
Gandalf
said
But
you
are
all
white
Yes
white
now
said
Gandalf
Indeed
_am_
Saruman
one
might
almost
say
Saruman
should
have
been
But
come
now
tell
yourselves
have
passed
through
fire
and
deep
water
since
parted
have
forgotten
much
that
thought
knew
and
learned
again
much
that
had
forgotten
can
see
many
things
far
off
but
many
things
that
are
close
hand
cannot
see
Tell
yourselves
What
you
wish
know
said
Aragorn
All
that
has
happened
since
parted
the
bridge
would
long
tale
Will
you
not
first
give
news
the
hobbits
Did
you
find
them
and
are
they
safe
did
not
find
them
said
Gandalf
There
was
darkness
over
the
valleys
the
Emyn
Muil
and
did
not
know
their
captivity
until
the
eagle
told
The
eagle
said
Legolas
have
seen
eagle
high
and
far
off
the
last
time
was
three
days
ago
above
the
Emyn
Muil
Yes
said
Gandalf
that
was
Gwaihir
the
Windlord
who
rescued
from
Orthanc
sent
him
before
watch
the
River
and
gather
tidings
His
sight
keen
but
cannot
see
all
that
passes
under
hill
and
tree
Some
things
has
seen
and
others
have
seen
myself
The
Ring
now
has
passed
beyond
help
the
help
any
the
Company
that
set
out
from
Rivendell
Very
nearly
was
revealed
the
Enemy
but
escaped
had
some
part
that
for
sat
high
place
and
strove
with
the
Dark
Tower
and
the
Shadow
passed
Then
was
weary
very
weary
and
walked
long
dark
thought
Then
you
know
about
Frodo
said
Gimli
How
things
with
him
cannot
say
was
saved
from
great
peril
but
many
lie
before
him
still
resolved
alone
Mordor
and
set
out
that
all
that
can
say
Not
alone
said
Legolas
think
that
Sam
went
with
him
Did
said
Gandalf
and
there
was
gleam
his
eye
and
smile
his
face
Did
indeed
news
yet
does
not
surprise
Good
Very
good
You
lighten
heart
You
must
tell
more
Now
sit
and
tell
the
tale
your
journey
The
companions
sat
the
ground
his
feet
and
Aragorn
took
the
tale
For
long
while
Gandalf
said
nothing
and
asked
questions
His
hands
were
spread
upon
his
knees
and
his
eyes
were
closed
last
when
Aragorn
spoke
the
death
Boromir
and
his
last
journey
upon
the
Great
River
the
old
man
sighed
You
have
not
said
all
that
you
know
guess
Aragorn
friend
said
quietly
Poor
Boromir
could
not
see
what
happened
him
was
sore
trial
for
such
man
warrior
and
lord
men
Galadriel
told
that
was
peril
But
escaped
the
end
glad
was
not
vain
that
the
young
hobbits
came
with
only
for
Boromir
sake
But
that
not
the
only
part
they
have
play
They
were
brought
Fangorn
and
their
coming
was
like
the
falling
small
stones
that
starts
avalanche
the
mountains
Even
talk
here
hear
the
first
rumblings
Saruman
had
best
not
caught
away
from
home
when
the
dam
bursts
one
thing
you
have
not
changed
dear
friend
said
Aragorn
you
still
speak
riddles
What
riddles
said
Gandalf
For
was
talking
aloud
myself
habit
the
old
they
choose
the
wisest
person
present
speak
the
long
explanations
needed
the
young
are
wearying
laughed
but
the
sound
now
seemed
warm
and
kindly
gleam
sunshine
longer
young
even
the
reckoning
Men
the
Ancient
Houses
said
Aragorn
Will
you
not
open
your
mind
more
clearly
What
then
shall
say
said
Gandalf
and
paused
for
while
thought
This
brief
how
see
things
the
moment
you
wish
have
piece
mind
plain
possible
The
Enemy
course
has
long
known
that
the
Ring
abroad
and
that
borne
hobbit
knows
now
the
number
our
Company
that
set
out
from
Rivendell
and
the
kind
each
But
does
not
yet
perceive
our
purpose
clearly
supposes
that
were
all
going
Minas
Tirith
for
that
what
would
himself
have
done
our
place
And
according
his
wisdom
would
have
been
heavy
stroke
against
his
power
Indeed
great
fear
not
knowing
what
mighty
one
may
suddenly
appear
wielding
the
Ring
and
assailing
him
with
war
seeking
cast
him
down
and
take
his
place
That
should
wish
cast
him
down
and
have
one
his
place
not
thought
that
occurs
his
mind
That
should
try
destroy
the
Ring
itself
has
not
yet
entered
into
his
darkest
dream
which
doubt
you
will
see
our
good
fortune
and
our
hope
For
imagining
war
has
let
loose
war
believing
that
has
time
waste
for
that
strikes
the
first
blow
strikes
hard
enough
may
need
strike
more
the
forces
that
has
long
been
preparing
now
setting
motion
sooner
than
intended
Wise
fool
For
had
used
all
his
power
guard
Mordor
that
none
could
enter
and
bent
all
his
guild
the
hunting
the
Ring
then
indeed
hope
would
have
faded
neither
Ring
nor
Bearer
could
long
have
eluded
him
But
now
his
eye
gazes
abroad
rather
than
near
home
and
mostly
looks
towards
Minas
Tirith
Very
soon
now
his
strength
will
fall
upon
like
storm
For
already
knows
that
the
messengers
that
sent
waylay
the
Company
have
failed
again
They
have
not
found
the
Ring
Neither
have
they
brought
away
any
hobbits
hostages
Had
they
done
even
much
that
would
have
been
heavy
blow
and
might
have
been
fatal
But
let
not
darken
our
hearts
imagining
the
trial
their
gentle
loyalty
the
Dark
Tower
For
the
Enemy
has
failed
far
Thanks
Saruman
Then
not
Saruman
traitor
said
Gimli
Indeed
yes
said
Gandalf
Doubly
And
not
that
strange
Nothing
that
have
endured
late
has
seemed
grievous
the
treason
Isengard
Even
reckoned
lord
and
captain
Saruman
has
grown
very
strong
threatens
the
Men
Rohan
and
draws
off
their
help
from
Minas
Tirith
even
the
main
blow
approaching
from
the
East
Yet
treacherous
weapon
ever
danger
the
hand
Saruman
also
had
mind
capture
the
Ring
for
himself
least
snare
some
hobbits
for
his
evil
purposes
between
them
our
enemies
have
contrived
only
bring
Merry
and
Pippin
with
marvellous
speed
and
the
nick
time
Fangorn
where
otherwise
they
would
never
have
come
all
Also
they
have
filled
themselves
with
new
doubts
that
disturb
their
plans
tidings
the
battle
will
come
Mordor
thanks
the
horsemen
Rohan
but
the
Dark
Lord
knows
that
two
hobbits
were
taken
the
Emyn
Muil
and
borne
away
towards
Isengard
against
the
will
his
own
servants
now
has
Isengard
fear
well
Minas
Tirith
Minas
Tirith
falls
will
ill
with
Saruman
pity
that
our
friends
lie
between
said
Gimli
land
divided
Isengard
and
Mordor
then
they
could
fight
while
watched
and
waited
The
victor
would
emerge
stronger
than
either
and
free
from
doubt
said
Gandalf
But
Isengard
cannot
fight
Mordor
unless
Saruman
first
obtains
the
Ring
That
will
never
now
does
not
yet
know
his
peril
There
much
that
does
not
know
was
eager
lay
his
hands
his
prey
that
could
not
wait
home
and
came
forth
meet
and
spy
his
messengers
But
came
too
late
for
once
and
the
battle
was
over
and
beyond
his
help
before
reached
these
parts
did
not
remain
here
long
look
into
his
mind
and
see
his
doubt
has
woodcraft
believes
that
the
horsemen
slew
and
burned
all
upon
the
field
battle
but
does
not
know
whether
the
Orcs
were
bringing
any
prisoners
not
And
does
not
know
the
quarrel
between
his
servants
and
the
Orcs
Mordor
nor
does
know
the
Winged
Messenger
The
Winged
Messenger
cried
Legolas
shot
him
with
the
bow
Galadriel
above
Sarn
Gebir
and
felled
him
from
the
sky
filled
all
with
fear
What
new
terror
this
One
that
you
cannot
slay
with
arrows
said
Gandalf
You
only
slew
his
steed
was
good
deed
but
the
Rider
was
soon
horsed
again
For
was
Nazgûl
one
the
Nine
who
ride
now
upon
winged
steeds
Soon
their
terror
will
overshadow
the
last
armies
our
friends
cutting
off
the
sun
But
they
have
not
yet
been
allowed
cross
the
River
and
Saruman
does
not
know
this
new
shape
which
the
Ringwraiths
have
been
clad
His
thought
ever
the
Ring
Was
present
the
battle
Was
found
What
Théoden
Lord
the
Mark
should
come
and
learn
its
power
That
the
danger
that
sees
and
has
fled
back
Isengard
double
and
treble
his
assault
Rohan
And
all
the
time
there
another
danger
close
hand
which
does
not
see
busy
with
his
fiery
thoughts
has
forgotten
Treebeard
Now
you
speak
yourself
again
said
Aragorn
with
smile
Treebeard
not
known
And
have
guessed
part
Saruman
double
treachery
yet
not
see
what
way
the
coming
two
hobbits
Fangorn
has
served
save
give
long
and
fruitless
chase
Wait
minute
cried
Gimli
There
another
thing
that
should
like
know
first
Was
you
Gandalf
Saruman
that
saw
last
night
You
certainly
did
not
see
answered
Gandalf
therefore
must
guess
that
you
saw
Saruman
Evidently
look
much
alike
that
your
desire
make
incurable
dent
hat
must
excused
Good
good
said
Gimli
glad
that
was
not
you
Gandalf
laughed
again
Yes
good
Dwarf
said
comfort
not
mistaken
all
points
not
know
only
too
well
But
course
never
blamed
you
for
your
welcome
How
could
who
have
often
counselled
friends
suspect
even
their
own
hands
when
dealing
with
the
Enemy
Bless
you
Gimli
son
Glóin
Maybe
you
will
see
both
together
one
day
and
judge
between
But
the
hobbits
Legolas
broke
have
come
far
seek
them
and
you
seem
know
where
they
are
Where
are
they
now
With
Treebeard
and
the
Ents
said
Gandalf
The
Ents
exclaimed
Aragorn
Then
there
truth
the
old
legends
about
the
dwellers
the
deep
forests
and
the
giant
shepherds
the
trees
Are
there
still
Ents
the
world
thought
they
were
only
memory
ancient
days
indeed
they
were
ever
more
than
legend
Rohan
legend
Rohan
cried
Legolas
Nay
every
Elf
Wilderland
has
sung
songs
the
old
Onodrim
and
their
long
sorrow
Yet
even
among
they
are
only
memory
were
meet
one
still
walking
this
world
then
indeed
should
feel
young
again
But
Treebeard
that
only
rendering
Fangorn
into
the
Common
Speech
yet
you
seem
speak
person
Who
this
Treebeard
now
you
are
asking
much
said
Gandalf
The
little
that
know
his
long
slow
story
would
make
tale
for
which
have
time
now
Treebeard
Fangorn
the
guardian
the
forest
the
oldest
the
Ents
the
oldest
living
thing
that
still
walks
beneath
the
Sun
upon
this
Middle
earth
hope
indeed
Legolas
that
you
may
yet
meet
him
Merry
and
Pippin
have
been
fortunate
they
met
him
here
even
where
sit
For
came
here
two
days
ago
and
bore
them
away
his
dwelling
far
off
the
roots
the
mountains
often
comes
here
especially
when
his
mind
uneasy
and
rumours
the
world
outside
trouble
him
saw
him
four
days
ago
striding
among
the
trees
and
think
saw
for
paused
but
did
not
speak
for
was
heavy
with
thought
and
weary
after
struggle
with
the
Eye
Mordor
and
did
not
speak
either
nor
call
name
Perhaps
also
thought
that
you
were
Saruman
said
Gimli
But
you
speak
him
was
friend
thought
Fangorn
was
dangerous
Dangerous
cried
Gandalf
And
very
dangerous
more
dangerous
than
anything
you
will
ever
meet
unless
you
are
brought
alive
before
the
seat
the
Dark
Lord
And
Aragorn
dangerous
and
Legolas
dangerous
You
are
beset
with
dangers
Gimli
son
Glóin
for
you
are
dangerous
yourself
your
own
fashion
Certainly
the
forest
Fangorn
perilous
not
least
those
that
are
too
ready
with
their
axes
and
Fangorn
himself
perilous
too
yet
wise
and
kindly
nonetheless
But
now
his
long
slow
wrath
brimming
over
and
all
the
forest
filled
with
The
coming
the
hobbits
and
the
tidings
that
they
brought
have
spilled
will
soon
running
like
flood
but
its
tide
turned
against
Saruman
and
the
axes
Isengard
thing
about
happen
which
has
not
happened
since
the
Elder
Days
the
Ents
are
going
wake
and
find
that
they
are
strong
What
will
they
asked
Legolas
astonishment
not
know
said
Gandalf
not
think
they
know
themselves
wonder
fell
silent
his
head
bowed
thought
The
others
looked
him
gleam
sun
through
fleeting
clouds
fell
his
hands
which
lay
now
upturned
his
lap
they
seemed
filled
with
light
cup
with
water
last
looked
and
gazed
straight
the
sun
The
morning
wearing
away
said
Soon
must
find
our
friends
and
see
Treebeard
asked
Aragorn
said
Gandalf
That
not
the
road
that
you
must
take
have
spoken
words
hope
But
only
hope
Hope
not
victory
War
upon
and
all
our
friends
war
which
only
the
use
the
Ring
could
give
surety
victory
fills
with
great
sorrow
and
great
fear
for
much
shall
destroyed
and
all
may
lost
Gandalf
Gandalf
the
White
but
Black
mightier
still
rose
and
gazed
out
eastward
shading
his
eyes
saw
things
far
away
that
none
them
could
see
Then
shook
his
head
said
soft
voice
has
gone
beyond
our
reach
that
least
let
glad
can
longer
tempted
use
the
Ring
must
down
face
peril
near
despair
yet
that
deadly
peril
removed
turned
Come
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
said
not
regret
your
choice
the
valley
the
Emyn
Muil
nor
call
vain
pursuit
You
chose
amid
doubts
the
path
that
seemed
right
the
choice
was
just
and
has
been
rewarded
For
have
met
time
who
otherwise
might
have
met
too
late
But
the
quest
your
companions
over
Your
next
journey
marked
your
given
word
You
must
Edoras
and
seek
out
Théoden
his
hall
For
you
are
needed
The
light
Andúril
must
now
uncovered
the
battle
for
which
has
long
waited
There

Rohan
and
worse
evil
goes
ill
with
Théoden
Then
are
not

the
merry
young
hobbits
again
said
Legolas
did
not

said
Gandalf
Who
knows
Have
patience
where
you
must
and
hope
Edoras
thither
also
long
way
for

young
old
said
Aragorn

the

over
long
ere

there

said
Gandalf
Will
you

Yes
will
set
out
together
said
Aragorn
But
not
doubt
that
you
will
come
there
before
you
wish
rose
and
looked
long
Gandalf
The
others
gazed
them
silence
they
stood
there
facing
one
another
The
grey
figure
the
Man
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
was
tall
and
stern
stone
his
hand
upon
the
hilt
his
sword
looked
some
king
out
the
mists
the
sea
had
stepped
upon
the
shores
lesser
men
Before
him
stooped
the
old
figure
white
shining
now
with
some
light
kindled
within
bent
laden
with
years
but
holding
power
beyond
the
strength
kings
not
say
truly
Gandalf
said
Aragorn
last
that
you
could
whithersoever
you
wished
quicker
than
And
this
also
say
you
are
our
captain
and
our
banner
The
Dark
Lord
has
Nine
But
have
One
mightier
than
they
the
White
Rider
has
passed
through
the
fire
and
the
abyss
and
they
shall
fear
him
will
where
leads
Yes
together
will
follow
you
said
Legolas
But
first
would
ease
heart
Gandalf
hear
what
befell
you
Moria
Will
you
not
tell
Can
you
not
stay
even
tell
your
friends
how
you
were
delivered
have
stayed
already
too
long
answered
Gandalf
Time
short
But
there
were
year
spend
would
not
tell
you
all
Then
tell
what
you
will
and
time
allows
said
Gimli
Come
Gandalf
tell
how
you
fared
with
the
Balrog
Name
him
not
said
Gandalf
and
for
moment
seemed
that
cloud
pain
passed
over
his
face
and
sat
silent
looking
old
death
Long
time
fell
said
last
slowly
thinking
back
with
difficulty
Long
fell
and
fell
with
His
fire
was
about
was
burned
Then
plunged
into
the
deep
water
and
all
was
dark
Cold
was
the
tide
death
almost
froze
heart
Deep
the
abyss
that
spanned
Durin
Bridge
and
none
has
measured
said
Gimli
Yet
has
bottom
beyond
light
and
knowledge
said
Gandalf
Thither
came
last
the
uttermost
foundations
stone
was
with
still
His
fire
was
quenched
but
now
was
thing
slime
stronger
than
strangling
snake
fought
far
under
the
living
earth
where
time
not
counted
Ever
clutched
and
ever
hewed
him
till
last
fled
into
dark
tunnels
They
were
not
made
Durin
folk
Gimli
son
Glóin
Far
far
below
the
deepest
delving
the
Dwarves
the
world
gnawed
nameless

Even
Sauron
knows
them
not
They
are

Now
have
walked
there
but
will
bring
report
darken
the
light
day
that
despair
enemy
was
only
hope
and
pursued
him
clutching
his
heel
Thus
brought
back
last
the
secret
ways
Khazad
dûm
too
well
knew
them
all
Ever
now
went
until
came
the
Endless
Stair
Long
has
that
been
lost
said
Gimli
Many
have
said
that
was
never
made
save
legend
but
others
say
that
was
destroyed
was
made
and
had
not
been
destroyed
said
Gandalf
From
the
lowest
dungeon
the
highest
peak
climbed
ascending
unbroken
spiral
many
thousand
steps
until
issued
last
Durin
Tower
carved
the
living
rock
Zirak
zigil
the
pinnacle
the
Silvertine
There
upon
Celebdil
was
lonely
window
the
snow
and
before
lay
narrow
space
dizzy
eyrie
above
the
mists
the
world
The
sun
shone
fiercely
there
but
all
below
was
wrapped
cloud
Out
sprang
and
even
came
behind
burst
into
new
flame
There
was
none
see
perhaps
after
ages
songs
would
still
sung
the
Battle
the
Peak
Suddenly
Gandalf
laughed
But
what
would
they
say
song
Those
that
looked
from
afar
thought
that
the
mountain
was
crowned
with
storm
Thunder
they
heard
and
lightning
they
said
smote
upon
Celebdil
and
leaped
back
broken
into
tongues
fire
not
that
enough
great
smoke
rose
about
vapour
and
steam
Ice
fell
like
rain
threw
down
enemy
and
fell
from
the
high
place
and
broke
the
mountain
side
where
smote
his
ruin
Then
darkness
took
and
strayed
out
thought
and
time
and
wandered
far
roads
that
will
not
tell
Naked
was
sent
back
for
brief
time
until
task
done
And
naked
lay
upon
the
mountain
top
The
tower
behind
was
crumbled
into
dust
the
window
gone
the
ruined
stair
was
choked
with
burned
and
broken
stone
was
alone
forgotten
without
escape
upon
the
hard
horn
the
world
There
lay
staring
upward
while
the
stars
wheeled
over
and
each
day
was
long
life
age
the
earth
Faint
ears
came
the
gathered
rumour
all
lands
the
springing
and
the
dying
the
song
and
the
weeping
and
the
slow
everlasting
groan
overburdened
stone
And
the
last
Gwaihir
the
Windlord
found
again
and
took
and
bore
away
Ever
fated
your
burden
friend
need
said
burden
you
have
been
answered
but
not
now
Light
swan
feather
claw
you
are
The
Sun
shines
through
you
Indeed
not
think
you
need
any
more
were
let
you
fall
you
would
float
upon
the
wind
not
let
fall
gasped
for
felt
life
again
Bear
Lothlórien
That
indeed
the
command
the
Lady
Galadriel
who
sent
look
for
you
answered
Thus
was
that
came
Caras
Galadhon
and
found
you
but
lately
gone
tarried
there
the
ageless
time
that
land
where
days
bring
healing
not
decay
Healing
found
and
was
clothed
white
Counsel
gave
and
counsel
took
Thence
strange
roads
came
and
messages
bring
some
you
Aragorn
was
bidden
say
this
Where
now
are
the
Dúnedain
Elessar
Elessar
Why
thy
kinsfolk
wander
afar
Near
the
hour
when
the
Lost
should
come
forth
And
the
Grey
Company
ride
from
the
North
But
dark
the
path
appointed
for
thee
The
Dead
watch
the
road
that
leads
the
Sea
Legolas
she
sent
this
word
Legolas
Greenleaf

thou
hast
lived
Beware
the
Sea

hearest
the
cry
the
gull
the
shore
Thy
heart
shall
then
rest
the
forest
more
Gandalf
fell
silent
and
shut
his
eyes
Then
she
sent
message
said
Gimli
and
bent
his
head
Dark
are
her
words
said
Legolas
and
little
they
mean
those
that
receive
them
That
comfort
said
Gimli
What
then
said
Legolas
Would
you
have
her
speak
openly
you
your
death
Yes
she
had
nought
else
say
What
that
said
Gandalf
opening
his
eyes
Yes
think
can
guess
what
her
words
may
mean
Your
pardon
Gimli
was
pondering
the
messages
once
again
But
indeed
she
sent
words
you
and
neither
dark
nor
sad
Gimli
son
Glóin
she
said
give
his
Lady
greeting
Lock
bearer
wherever
thou
goest
thought
goes
with
thee
But
have
care
lay
thine
axe
the
right
tree
happy
hour
you
have
returned
Gandalf
cried
the
Dwarf
capering
sang
loudly
the
strange
dwarf
tongue
Come
come
shouted
swinging
his
axe
Since
Gandalf
head
now
sacred
let
find
one
that
right
cleave
That
will
not
far
seek
said
Gandalf
rising
from
his
seat
Come
have
spent
all
the
time
that
allowed
meeting
parted
friends
Now
there
need
haste
wrapped
himself
again
his
old
tattered
cloak
and
led
the
way
Following
him
they
descended
quickly
from
the
high
shelf
and
made
their
way
back
through
the
forest
down
the
bank
the
Entwash
They
spoke
more
words
until
they
stood
again
upon
the
grass
beyond
the
eaves
Fangorn
There
was
sign
their
horses
seen
They
have
not
returned
said
Legolas
will
weary
walk
shall
not
walk
Time
presses
said
Gandalf
Then
lifting
his
head
gave
long
whistle
clear
and
piercing
was
the
note
that
the
others
stood
amazed
hear
such
sound
come
from
those
old
bearded
lips
Three
times
whistled
and
then
faint
and
far
off
seemed
them
that
they
heard
the
whinny
horse
borne
from
the
plains
upon
the
eastern
wind
They
waited
wondering
Before
long
there
came
the
sound
hoofs
first
hardly
more
than
tremor
the
ground
perceptible
only
Aragorn
lay
upon
the
grass
then
growing
steadily
louder
and
clearer
quick
beat
There
more
than
one
horse
coming
said
Aragorn
Certainly
said
Gandalf
are
too
great
burden
for
one
There
are
three
said
Legolas
gazing
out
over
the
plain
See
how
they
run
There
Hasufel
and
there
friend
Arod
beside
him
But
there
another
that
strides
ahead
very
great
horse
have
not
seen
his
like
before
Nor
will
you
again
said
Gandalf
That
Shadowfax
the
chief
the
_Mearas_
lords
horses
and
not
even
Théoden
King
Rohan
has
ever
looked
better
Does
not
shine
like
silver
and
run
smoothly
swift
stream
has
come
for
the
horse
the
White
Rider
are
going
battle
together
Even
the
old
wizard
spoke
the
great
horse
came
striding
the
slope
towards
them
his
coat
was
glistening
and
his
mane
flowing
the
wind
his
speed
The
two
others
followed
now
far
behind
soon
Shadowfax
saw
Gandalf
checked
his
pace
and
whinnied
loudly
then
trotting
gently
forward
stooped
his
proud
head
and
nuzzled
his
great
nostrils
against
the
old
man
neck
Gandalf
caressed
him
long
way
from
Rivendell
friend
said
but
you
are
wise
and
swift
and
come
need
Far
let
ride
now
together
and
part
not
this
world
again
Soon
the
other
horses
came
and
stood
quietly
awaiting
orders
once
Meduseld
the
hall
your
master
Théoden
said
Gandalf
addressing
them
gravely
They
bowed
their
heads
Time
presses
with
your
leave
friends
will
ride
beg
you
use
all
the
speed
that
you
can
Hasufel
shall
bear
Aragorn
and
Arod
Legolas
will
set
Gimli
before
and
his
leave
Shadowfax
shall
bear
both
will
wait
now
only
drink
little
Now
understand
part
last
night
riddle
said
Legolas
sprang
lightly
upon
Arod
back
Whether
they
fled
first
fear
not
our
horses
met
Shadowfax
their
chieftain
and
greeted
him
with
joy
Did
you
know
that
was
hand
Gandalf
Yes
knew
said
the
wizard
bent
thought
upon
him
bidding
him
make
haste
for
yesterday
was
far
away
the
south
this
land
Swiftly
may
bear
back
again
Gandalf
spoke
now
Shadowfax
and
the
horse
set
off
good
pace
yet
not
beyond
the
measure
the
others
After
little
while
turned
suddenly
and
choosing
place
where
the
banks
were
lower
waded
the
river
and
then
led
them
away
due
south
into
flat
land
treeless
and
wide
The
wind
went
like
grey
waves
through
the
endless
miles
grass
There
was
sign
road
track
but
Shadowfax
did
not
stay
falter
steering
straight
course
now
for
the
halls
Théoden
under
the
slopes
the
White
Mountains
said
Gandalf
will
quicker
The
ground
firmer
the
Eastemnet
where
the
chief
northward
track
lies
across
the
river
but
Shadowfax
knows
the
way
through
every
fen
and
hollow
For
many
hours
they
rode
through
the
meads
and
riverlands
Often
the
grass
was
high
that
reached
above
the
knees
the
riders
and
their
steeds
seemed
swimming
grey
green
sea
They
came
upon
many
hidden
pools
and
broad
acres
sedge
waving
above
wet
and
treacherous
bogs
but
Shadowfax
found
the
way
and
the
other
horses
followed
his
swath
Slowly
the
sun
fell
from
the
sky
down
into
the
West
Looking
out
over
the
great
plain
far
away
the
riders
saw
for
moment
like
red
fire
sinking
into
the
grass
Low
upon
the
edge
sight
shoulders
the
mountains
glinted
red
upon
either
side
smoke
seemed
rise
and
darken
the
sun
disc
the
hue
blood
had
kindled
the

passed
down
under
the
rim
earth
There
lies
the
Gap
Rohan
said
Gandalf
now
almost
due
west
That
way
lies

great
smoke
said
Legolas
What
may
that
Battle
and
war
said
Gandalf
Ride
_Chapter
The
King
the
Golden
Hall
They
rode
through
sunset
and
slow
dusk
and
gathering
night
When
last
they
halted
and
dismounted
even
Aragorn
was
stiff
and
weary
Gandalf
only
allowed
them
few
hours
rest
Legolas
and
Gimli
slept
and
Aragorn
lay
flat
stretched
upon
his
back
but
Gandalf
stood
leaning
his
staff
gazing
into
the
darkness
east
and
west
All
was
silent
and
there
was
sign
sound
living
thing
The
night
was
barred
with
long
clouds
fleeting
chill
wind
when
they
arose
again
Under
the
cold
moon
they
went
once
more
swift
the
light
day
Hours
passed
and
still
they
rode
Gimli
nodded
and
would
have
fallen
from
his
seat
Gandalf
had
not
clutched
and
shaken
him
Hasufel
and
Arod
weary
but
proud
followed
their
tireless
leader
grey
shadow
before
them
hardly
seen
The
miles
went
The
waxing
moon
sank
into
the
cloudy
West
bitter
chill
came
into
the
air
Slowly
the
East
the
dark
faded
cold
grey
Red
shafts
light
leapt
above
the
black
walls
the
Emyn
Muil
far
away
upon
their
left
Dawn
came
clear
and
bright
wind
swept
across
their
path
rushing
through
the
bent
grasses
Suddenly
Shadowfax
stood
still
and
neighed
Gandalf
pointed
ahead
Look
cried
and
they
lifted
their
tired
eyes
Before
them
stood
the
mountains
the
South
white
tipped
and
streaked
with
black
The
grass
lands
rolled
against
the
hills
that
clustered
their
feet
and
flowed
into
many
valleys
still
dim
and
dark
untouched
the
light
dawn
winding
their
way
into
the
heart
the
great
mountains
Immediately
before
the
travellers
the
widest
these
glens
opened
like
long
gulf
among
the
hills
Far
inward
they
glimpsed
tumbled
mountain
mass
with
one
tall
peak
the
mouth
the
vale
there
stood
like
sentinel
lonely
height
About
its
feet
there
flowed
thread
silver
the
stream
that
issued
from
the
dale
upon
its
brow
they
caught
still
far
away
glint
the
rising
sun
glimmer
gold
Speak
Legolas
said
Gandalf
Tell
what
you
see
there
before
Legolas
gazed
ahead
shading
his
eyes
from
the
level
shafts
the
new
risen
sun
see
white
stream
that
comes
down
from
the
snows
said
Where
issues
from
the
shadow
the
vale
green
hill
rises
upon
the
east
dike
and
mighty
wall
and
thorny
fence
encircle
Within
there
rise
the
roofs
houses
and
the
midst
set
upon
green
terrace
there
stands
aloft
great
hall
Men
And
seems
eyes
that
thatched
with
gold
The
light
shines
far
over
the
land
Golden
too
are
the
posts
its
doors
There
men
bright
mail
stand
but
all
else
within
the
courts
are
yet
asleep
Edoras
those
courts
are
called
said
Gandalf
and
Meduseld
that
golden
hall
There
dwells
Théoden
son
Thengel
King
the
Mark
Rohan
are
come
with
the
rising
the
day
Now
the
road
lies
plain
see
before
But
must
ride
more
warily
for
war
abroad
and
the
Rohirrim
the
Horse
lords
not
sleep
even
seem
from
afar
Draw
weapon
speak
haughty
word
counsel
you
all
until
are
come
before
Théoden
seat
The
morning
was
bright
and
clear
about
them
and
birds
were
singing
when
the
travellers
came
the
stream
ran
down
swiftly
into
the
plain
and
beyond
the
feet
the
hills
turned
across
their
path
wide
bend
flowing
away
east
feed
the
Entwash
far
off
its
reed
choked
beds
The
land
was
green
the
wet
meads
and
along
the
grassy
borders
the
stream
grew
many
willow
trees
Already
this
southern
land
they
were
blushing
red
their
fingertips
Feeling
the
approach
spring
Over
the
stream
there
was
ford
between
low
banks
much
trampled
the
passage
horses
The
travellers
passed
over
and
came
upon
wide
rutted
track
leading
towards
the
uplands
the
foot
the
walled
hill
the
way
ran
under
the
shadow
many
mounds
high
and
green
Upon
their
western
sides
the
grass
was
white
with
drifted
snow
small
flowers
sprang
there
like
countless
stars
amid
the
turf
Look
said
Gandalf
How
fair
are
the
bright
eyes
the
grass
Evermind
they
are
called
_simbelmynë_
this
land
Men
for
they
blossom
all
the
seasons
the
year
and
grow
where
dead
men
rest
Behold
are
come
the
great
barrows
where
the
sires
Théoden
sleep
Seven
mounds
upon
the
left
and
nine
upon
the
right
said
Aragorn
Many
long
lives
men
since
the
golden
hall
was
built
Five
hundred
times
have
the
red
leaves
fallen
Mirkwood
home
since
then
said
Legolas
and
but
little
while
does
that
seem
But
the
Riders
the
Mark
seems
long
ago
said
Aragorn
that
the
raising
this
house
but
memory
song
and
the
years
before
are
lost
the
mist
time
Now
they
call
this
land
their
home
their
own
and
their
speech
sundered
from
their
northern
kin
Then
began
chant
softly
slow
tongue
unknown
the
Elf
and
Dwarf
yet
they
listened
for
there
was
strong
music
That
guess
the
language
the
Rohirrim
said
Legolas
for
like
this
land
itself
rich
and
rolling
part
and
else
hard
and
stern
the
mountains
But
cannot
guess
what
means
save
that
laden
with
the
sadness
Mortal
Men
runs
thus
the
Common
Speech
said
Aragorn
near
can
make
Where
now
the
horse
and
the
rider
Where
the
horn
that
was
blowing
Where
the
helm
and
the
hauberk
and
the
bright
hair
flowing
Where
the
hand
the
harpstring
and
the
red
fire
glowing
Where
the
spring
and
the
harvest
and
the
tall
corn
growing
They
have
passed
like
rain
the
mountain
like
wind
the
meadow
The
days
have
gone
down
the
West
behind
the
hills
into
shadow
Who
shall
gather
the
smoke
the
dead
wood
burning
behold
the
flowing
years
from
the
Sea
returning
Thus
spoke
forgotten
poet
long
ago
Rohan
recalling
how
tall
and
fair
was
Eorl
the
Young
who
rode
down
out
the
North
and
there
were
wings
upon
the
feet
his
steed
Felaróf
father
horses
men
still
sing
the
evening
With
these
words
the
travellers
passed
the
silent
mounds
Following
the
winding
way
the
green
shoulders
the
hills
they
came
last
the
wide
wind
swept
walls
and
the
gates
Edoras
There
sat
many
men
bright
mail
who
sprang
once
their
feet
and
barred
the
way
with
spears
Stay
strangers
here
unknown
they
cried
the
tongue
the
Riddermark
demanding
the
names
and
errand
the
strangers
Wonder
was
their
eyes
but
little
friendliness
and
they
looked
darkly
upon
Gandalf
Well
understand
your
speech
answered
the
same
language
yet
few
strangers
Why
then
you
not
speak
the
Common
Tongue
the
custom
the
West
you
wish
answered
the
will
Théoden
King
that
none
should
enter
his
gates
save
those
who
know
our
tongue
and
are
our
friends
replied
one
the
guards
None
are
welcome
here
days
war
but
our
own
folk
and
those
that
come
from
Mundburg
the
land
Gondor
Who
are
you
that
come
heedless
over
the
plain
thus
strangely
clad
riding
horses
like
our
own
horses
Long
have
kept
guard
here
and
have
watched
you
from
afar
Never
have
seen
other
riders
strange
nor
any
horse
more
proud
than
one
these
that
bear
you
One
the
_Mearas_
unless
our
eyes
are
cheated
some
spell
Say
are
you
not
wizard
some
spy
from
Saruman
phantoms
his
craft
Speak
now
and
swift
are
phantoms
said
Aragorn
nor
your
eyes
cheat
you
For
indeed
these
are
your
own
horses
that
ride
you
knew
well
are
you
asked
guess
But
seldom
does
thief
ride
home
the
stable
Here
are
Hasufel
and
Arod
that
Éomer
the
Third
Marshal
the
Mark
lent
only
two
days
ago
bring
them
back
now
even
promised
him
Has
not
Éomer
then
returned
and
given
warning
our
coming
troubled
look
came
into
the
guard
eyes
Éomer
have
naught
say
answered
what
you
tell
truth
then
doubtless
Théoden
will
have
heard
Maybe
your
coming
was
not
wholly
unlooked
for
but
two
nights
ago
that
Wormtongue
came
and
said
that
the
will
Théoden
stranger
should
pass
these
gates
Wormtongue
said
Gandalf
looking
sharply
the
guard
Say
more
errand
not
Wormtongue
but
the
Lord
the
Mark
himself
haste
Will
you
not
send
say
that
are
come
His
eyes
glinted
under
his
deep
brows
bent
his
gaze
upon
the
man
Yes
will
answered
slowly
But
what
names
shall
report
And
what
shall
say
you
Old
and
weary
you
seem
now
and
yet
you
are
fell
and
grim
beneath
deem
Well
you
see
and
speak
said
the
wizard
For
Gandalf
have
returned
And
behold
too
bring
back
horse
Here
Shadowfax
the
Great
whom
other
hand
can
tame
And
here
beside
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
the
heir
Kings
and
Mundburg
that
goes
Here
also
are
Legolas
the
Elf
and
Gimli
the
Dwarf
our
comrades
now
and
say
your
master
that
are
his
gates
and
would
have
speech
with
him
will
permit
come
into
his
hall
Strange
names
you
give
indeed
But
will
report
them
you
bid
and
learn
master
will
said
the
guard
Wait
here
little
while
and
will
bring
you
such
answer
seems
good
him
not
hope
too
much
These
are
dark
days
went
swiftly
away
leaving
the
strangers
the
watchful
keeping
his
comrades
After
some
time
returned
Follow
said
Théoden
gives
you
leave
enter
but
any
weapon
that
you
bear
only
staff
you
must
leave
the
threshold
The
doorwardens
will
keep
them
The
dark
gates
were
swung
open
The
travellers
entered
walking
file
behind
their
guide
They
found
broad
path
paved
with
hewn
stones
now
winding
upward
now
climbing
short
flights
well
laid
steps
Many
houses
built
wood
and
many
dark
doors
they
passed
Beside
the
way
stone
channel
stream
clear
water
flowed
sparkling
and
chattering
length
they
came
the
crown
the
hill
There
stood
high
platform
above
green
terrace
the
foot
which
bright
spring
gushed
from
stone
carved
the
likeness
horse
head
beneath
was
wide
basin
from
which
the
water
spilled
and
fed
the
falling
stream
the
green
terrace
went
stair
stone
high
and
broad
and
either
side
the
topmost
step
were
stone
hewn
sea
There
sat
other
guards
with
drawn
swords
laid
upon
their
knees
Their
golden
hair
was
braided
their
shoulders
the
sun
was
blazoned
upon
their
green
shields
their
long
corslets
were
burnished
bright
and
when
they
rose
taller
they
seemed
than
mortal
men
There
are
the
doors
before
you
said
the
guide
must
return
now
duty
the
gate
Farewell
And
may
the
Lord
the
Mark
gracious
you
turned
and
went
swiftly
back
down
the
road
The
others
climbed
the
long
stair
under
the
eyes
the
tall
watchmen
Silent
they
stood
now
above
and
spoke
word
until
Gandalf
stepped
out
upon
the
paved
terrace
the
stairs
head
Then
suddenly
with
clear
voices
they

their

tongue
Hail
corners
from
afar
they
said
and
they
turned
the
hilts
their
swords
towards
the
travellers
token
peace
Green
gems
flashed
the
sunlight
Then
one
the
guards
stepped
forward
and
spoke
the
Common
Speech
the
Doorward
Théoden
said
Háma
name
Here
must
bid
you
lay
aside
your
weapons
before
you
enter
Then
Legolas
gave
into
his
hand
his
silver
hafted
knife
his
quiver
and
his
bow
Keep
these
well
said
for
they
come
from
the
Golden
Wood
and
the
Lady
Lothlórien
gave
them
Wonder
came
into
the
man
eyes
and
laid
the
weapons
hastily
the

Aragorn
stood
while
hesitating
not

Andúril

hand

other
man

will
Théoden
said
Háma
not
clear
that
the
will
Théoden

Thengel

Mark
should

over

Aragorn

Gondor
This

King

Denethor
said
Háma
stepping
swiftly
before
the
doors
and
barring
the
way
His
sword
was
now
his
hand
and
the
point
towards
the
strangers
This
idle
talk
said
Gandalf
Needless
Théoden
demand
but
useless
refuse
king

have
his
way
his
own
hall
folly
wisdom
Truly
said
Aragorn
And
would
the
master
the
house
bade
were
this
only
woodman
cot
bore
now
any
sword
but
Andúril
Whatever
its
name
may
said
Háma
here
you
shall
lay
you
would
not
fight
alone
against
all
the
men
Edoras
Not

said
Gimli
fingering
the
blade
his
axe
and
looking
darkly
the
guard
were
young

that
Gimli
had

Not
alone
Come

Gandalf

Háma
Keep

for

Elves

long
ago
Now
let
pass
Come
Aragorn
Slowly
Aragorn
unbuckled
his
belt
and
himself
set
his
sword
upright
against
the
wall
Here
set
said
but
command
you
not
touch
nor
permit

this

Telchar

Death

any

that

The
guard
stepped
back
and
looked
with
amazement
Aragorn
seems
that
you
are
come
the
wings
song
out
the
forgotten
days
said
shall

Well
said
Gimli

without

and
laid
the
floor
Now
then
all
you
wish
let
and
speak
with
your
master
The
guard
still
hesitated
Your
staff
said
Gandalf
Forgive
but
that
too
must
left
the
doors
Foolishness
said
Gandalf
Prudence
one
thing
but
discourtesy
another
old
may
not
lean
stick
then
will
sit
out
here
until
pleases
Théoden
hobble
out
himself
speak
with
Aragorn
laughed
Every
man
has
something
too
dear
trust
another
But
would
you
part
old
man
from
his
support
Come
will
you
not
let
enter
The
staff
the
hand
wizard
may
more
than
prop
for
age
said
Háma
looked
hard
the
ash
staff
which
Gandalf
leaned
Yet
doubt
man
worth
will
trust
his
own
wisdom
believe
you
are
friends
and
folk
worthy
honour
who
have
evil
purpose
You
may
The
guards
now
lifted
the
heavy
bars
the
doors
and
swung
them
slowly
inwards
grumbling
their
great
hinges
The
travellers
entered
Inside
seemed
dark
and
warm
after
the
clear
air
upon
the
hill
The
hall
was
long
and
wide
and
filled
with
shadows
and
half
lights
mighty
pillars
upheld
its
lofty
roof
But
here
and
there
bright
sunbeams
fell
glimmering
shafts
from
the
eastern
windows
high
under
the
deep
eaves
Through
the
louver
the
roof
above
the
thin
wisps
issuing
smoke
the
sky
showed
pale
and
blue
their
eyes
changed
the
travellers
perceived
that
the
floor
was
paved
with
stones
many
hues
branching
runes
and
strange
devices
intertwined
beneath
their
feet
They
saw
now
that
the
pillars
were
richly
carved
gleaming
dully
with
gold
and
half
seen
colours
Many
woven
cloths
were
hung
upon
the
walls
and
over
their
wide
spaces
marched
figures
ancient
legend
some
dim
with
years
some
darkling
the
shade
But
upon
one
form
the
sunlight
fell
young
man
upon
white
horse
was
blowing
great
horn
and
his
yellow
hair
was
flying
the
wind
The
horse
head
was
lifted
and
its
nostrils
were
wide
and
red
neighed
smelling
battle
afar
Foaming
water
green
and
white
rushed
and
curled
about
its
knees
Behold
Eorl
the
Young
said
Aragorn
Thus
rode
out
the
North
the
Battle
the
Field
Celebrant
Now
the
four
companions
went
forward
past
the
clear
wood
fire
burning
upon
the
long
hearth
the
midst
the
hall
Then
they
halted
the
far
end
the
house
beyond
the
hearth
and
facing
north
towards
the
doors
was
dais
with
three
steps
and
the
middle
the
dais
was
great
gilded
chair
Upon
sat
man
bent
with
age
that
seemed
almost
dwarf
but
his
white
hair
was
long
and
thick
and
fell
great
braids
from
beneath
thin
golden
circle
set
upon
his
brow
the
centre
upon
his
forehead
shone
single
white
diamond
His
beard
was
laid
like
snow
upon
his
knees
but
his
eyes
still
burned
with
bright
light
glinting
gazed
the
strangers
Behind
his
chair
stood
woman
clad
white
his
feet
upon
the
steps
sat
wizened
figure
man
with
pale
wise
face
and
heavy
lidded
eyes
There
was
silence
The
old
man
did
not
move
his
chair
length
Gandalf
spoke
Hail
Théoden
son
Thengel
have
returned
For
behold
the
storm
comes
and
now
all
friends
should
gather
together
lest
each
singly
destroyed
Slowly
the
old
man
rose
his
feet
leaning
heavily
upon
short
black
staff
with
handle
white
bone
and
now
the
strangers
saw
that
bent
though
was
was
still
tall
and
must
youth
have
been
high
and
proud
indeed
greet
you
said
and
maybe
you
look
for
welcome
But
truth
tell
your
welcome
doubtful
here
Master
Gandalf
You
have
ever
been
herald
woe
Troubles
follow
you
like
crows
and
ever
the
oftener
the
worse
will
not
deceive
you
when
heard
that
Shadowfax
had
come
back
riderless
rejoiced
the
return
the
horse
but
still
more
the
lack
the
rider
and
when
Éomer
brought
the
tidings
that
you
had
gone
last
your
long
home
did
not
mourn
But
news
from
afar
seldom
sooth
Here
you
come
again
And
with
you
come
evils
worse
than
before
might
expected
Why
should
welcome
you
Gandalf
Stormcrow
Tell
that
Slowly
sat
down
again
his
chair
You
speak
justly
lord
said
the
pale
man
sitting
upon
the
steps
the
dais
not
yet
five
days
since
the
bitter
tidings
came
that
Théodred
your
son
was
slain
upon
the
West
Marches
your
right
hand
Second
Marshal
the
Mark
Éomer
there
little
trust
Few
men
would
left
guard
your
walls
had
been
allowed
rule
And
even
now
learn
from
Gondor
that
the
Dark
Lord
stirring
the
East
Such
the
hour
which
this
wanderer
chooses
return
Why
indeed
should
welcome
you
Master
Stormcrow
_Láthspell_
name
you
Ill
news
and
ill
news
ill
guest
they
say
laughed
grimly
lifted
his
heavy
lids
for
moment
and
gazed
the
strangers
with
dark
eyes
You
are
held
wise
friend
Wormtongue
and
are
doubtless
great
support
your
master
answered
Gandalf
soft
voice
Yet
two
ways
may
man
come
with
evil
tidings
lie
may
worker
evil
may
such
leaves
well
alone
and
comes
only
bring
aid
time
need
That
said
Wormtongue
but
there
third
kind
pickers
bones
meddlers
other
men
sorrows
carrion
fowl
that
grow
fat
war
What
aid
have
you
ever
brought
Stormcrow
And
what
aid
you
bring
now
was
aid
from
that
you
sought
last
time
that
you
were
here
Then
lord
bade
you
Choose
any
horse
that
you
would
and
gone
and
the
wonder
all
you
took
Shadowfax
your
insolence
lord
was
sorely
grieved
yet
some
seemed
that
speed
you
from
the
land
the
price
was
not
too
great
guess
that
likely
turn
out
the
same
once
more
you
will
seek
aid
rather
than
render
you
bring
men
you
bring
horses
swords
spears
That
would
call
aid
that
our
present
need
But
who
are
these
that
follow
your
tail
Three
ragged
wanderers
grey
and
you
yourself
the
most
beggar
like
the
four
The
courtesy
your
hall
somewhat
lessened
late
Théoden
son
Thengel
said
Gandalf
Has
not
the
messenger
from
your
gate
reported
the
names
companions
Seldom
has
any
lord
Rohan
received
three
such
guests
Weapons
they
have
laid
your
doors
that
are
worth
many
mortal
man
even
the
mightiest
Grey
their
raiment
for
the
Elves
clad
them
and
thus
they
have
passed
through
the
shadow
great
perils
your
hall
Then
true
Éomer
reported
that
you
are
league
with
the
Sorceress
the
Golden
Wood
said
Wormtongue
not
wondered
webs
deceit
were
ever
woven
Dwimordene
Gimli
strode
pace
forward
but
felt
suddenly
the
hand
Gandalf
clutch
him
the
shoulder
and
halted
standing
stiff
stone
Dwimordene
Lórien
Seldom
have
walked
the
feet
Men
Few
mortal
eyes
have
seen
the
light
That
lies
there
ever
long
and
bright
Galadriel
Galadriel
Clear
the
water
your
well
White
the
star
your
white
hand
Unmarred
unstained
leaf
and
land
Dwimordene
Lórien
More
fair
than
thoughts
Mortal
Men
Thus
Gandalf
softly
sang
and
then
suddenly
changed
Casting
his
tattered
cloak
aside
stood
and
leaned
longer
his
staff
and
spoke
clear
cold
voice
The
wise
speak
only
what
they
know
Gríma
son
Gálmód
witless
worm
have
you
become
Therefore
silent
and
keep
your
forked
tongue
behind
your
teeth
have
not
passed
through
fire
and
death
bandy
crooked
words
with
serving
man
till
the
lightning
falls
raised
his
staff
There
was
roll
thunder
The
sunlight
was
blotted
out
from
the
eastern
windows
the
whole
hall
became
suddenly
dark
night
The
fire
faded
sullen
embers
Only
Gandalf
could
seen
standing
white
and
tall
before
the
blackened
hearth
the
gloom
they
heard
the
hiss
Wormtongue
voice
Did
not
counsel
you
lord
forbid
his
staff
That
fool
Háma
has
betrayed
There
was
flash
lightning
had
cloven
the
roof
Then
all
was
silent
Wormtongue
sprawled
his
face
Now
Théoden
son
Thengel
will
you
hearken
said
Gandalf
you
ask
for
help
lifted
his
staff
and
pointed
high
window
There
the
darkness
seemed
clear
and
through
the
opening
could
seen
high
and
far
patch
shining
sky
Not
all
dark
Take
courage
Lord
the
Mark
for
better
help
you
will
not
find
counsel
have
give
those
that
despair
Yet
counsel
could
give
and
words
could
speak
you
Will
you
hear
them
They
are
not
for
all
ears
bid
you
come
out
before
your
doors
and
look
abroad
Too
long
have
you
sat
shadows
and
trusted
twisted
tales
and
crooked
promptings
Slowly
Théoden
left
his
chair
faint
light
grew
the
hall
again
The
woman
hastened
the
king
side
taking
his
arm
and
with
faltering
steps
the
old
man
came
down
from
the
dais
and
paced
softly
through
the
hall
Wormtongue
remained
lying
the
floor
They
came
the
doors
and
Gandalf
knocked
Open
cried
The
Lord
the
Mark
comes
forth
The
doors
rolled
back
and
keen
air
came
whistling
wind
was
blowing
the
hill
Send
your
guards
down
the
stairs
foot
said
Gandalf
And
you
lady
leave
him
while
with
will
care
for
him
Éowyn
sister
daughter
said
the
old
king
The
time
for
fear
past
The
woman
turned
and
went
slowly
into
the
house
she
passed
the
doors
she
turned
and
looked
back
Grave
and
thoughtful
was
her
glance
she
looked
the
king
with
cool
pity
her
eyes
Very
fair
was
her
face
and
her
long
hair
was
like
river
gold
Slender
and
tall
she
was
her
white
robe
girt
with
silver
but
strong
she
seemed
and
stern
steel
daughter
kings
Thus
Aragorn
for
the
first
time
the
full
light
day
beheld
Éowyn
Lady
Rohan
and
thought
her
fair
fair
and
cold
like
morning
pale
spring
that
not
yet
come
womanhood
And
she
now
was
suddenly
aware
him
tall
heir
kings
wise
with
many
winters
greycloaked
Hiding
power
that
yet
she
felt
For
moment
still
stone
she
stood
then
turning
swiftly
she
was
gone
Now
lord
said
Gandalf
look
out
upon
your
land
Breathe
the
free
air
again
From
the
porch
upon
the
top
the
high
terrace
they
could
see
beyond
the
stream
the
green
fields
Rohan
fading
into
distant
grey
Curtains
wind
blown
rain
were
slanting
down
The
sky
above
and
the
west
was
still
dark
with
thunder
and
lightning
far
away
flickered
among
the
tops
hidden
hills
But
the
wind
had
shifted
the
north
and
already
the
storm
that
had
come
out
the
East
was
receding
rolling
away
southward
the
sea
Suddenly
through
rent
the
clouds
behind
them
shaft
sun
stabbed
down
The
falling
showers
gleamed
like
silver
and
far
away
the
river
glittered
like
shimmering
glass
not
dark
here
said
Théoden
said
Gandalf
Nor
does
age
lie
heavily
your
shoulders
some
would
have
you
think
Cast
aside
your
prop
From
the
king
hand
the
black
staff
fell
clattering
the
stones
drew
himself
slowly
man
that
stiff
from
long
bending
over
some
dull
toil
Now
tall
and
straight
stood
and
his
eyes
were
blue
looked
into
the
opening
sky
Dark
have
been
dreams
late
said
but
feel
one
new
awakened
would
now
that
you
had
come
before
Gandalf
For
fear
that
already
you
have
come
too
late
only
see
the
last
days
house
Not
long
now
shall
stand
the
high
hall
which
Brego
son
Eorl
built
Fire
shall
devour
the
high
seat
What
done
Much
said
Gandalf
But
first
send
for
Éomer
not
guess
rightly
that
you
hold
him
prisoner
the
counsel
Gríma
him
that
all
save
you
name
the
Wormtongue
true
said
Théoden
had
rebelled
against
commands
and
threatened
death
Gríma
hall
man
may
love
you
and
yet
not
love
Wormtongue
his
counsels
said
Gandalf
That
may
will
you
ask
Call
Háma
Since
proved
untrusty
doorward
let
him
become
errand
runner
The
guilty
shall
bring
the
guilty
judgement
said
Théoden
and
his
voice
was
grim
yet
looked
Gandalf
and
smiled
and
did
many
lines
care
were
smoothed
away
and
did
not
return
When
Háma
had
been
summoned
and
had
gone
Gandalf
led
Théoden
stone
seat
and
then
sat
himself
before
the
king
upon
the
topmost
stair
Aragorn
and
his
companions
stood
nearby
There
time
tell
all
that
you
should
hear
said
Gandalf
Yet
hope
not
cheated
time
will
come
ere
long
when
can
speak
more
fully
Behold
you
are
come
into
peril
greater
even
than
the
wit
Wormtongue
could
weave
into
your
dreams
But
see
you
dream
longer
You
live
Gondor
and
Rohan
not
stand
alone
The
enemy
strong
beyond
our
reckoning
yet
have
hope
which
has
not
guessed
Quickly
now
Gandalf
spoke
His
voice
was
low
and
secret
and
none
save
the
king
heard
what
said
But
ever
spoke
the
light
shone
brighter
Théoden
eye
and
the
last
rose
from
his
seat
his
full
height
and
Gandalf
beside
him
and
together
they
looked
out
from
the
high
place
towards
the
East
Verily
said
Gandalf
now
loud
voice
keen
and
clear
that
way
lies
our
hope
where
sits
our
greatest
fear
Doom
hangs
still
thread
Yet
hope
there
still
can
but
stand
unconquered
for
little
while
The
others
too
now
turned
their
eyes
eastward
Over
the
sundering
leagues
land
far
away
they
gazed
the
edge
sight
and
hope
and
fear
bore
their
thoughts
still
beyond
dark
mountains
the
Land
Shadow
Where
now
was
the
Ring
bearer
How
thin
indeed
was
the
thread
upon
which
doom
still
hung
seemed
Legolas
strained
his
farseeing
eyes
that
caught
glint
white
far
away
perchance
the
sun
twinkled
pinnacle
the
Tower
Guard
And
further
still
endlessly
remote
and
yet
present
threat
there
was
tiny
tongue
flame
Slowly
Théoden
sat
down
again
weariness
still
struggled
master
him
against
the
will
Gandalf
turned
and
looked
his
great
house
Alas
said
that
these
evil
days
should
mine
and
should
come
old
age
instead
that
peace
which
have
earned
Alas
for
Boromir
the
brave
The
young
perish
and
the
old
linger
withering
clutched
his
knees
with
his
wrinkled
hands
Your
fingers
would
remember
their
old
strength
better
they
grasped
sword
hilt
said
Gandalf
Théoden
rose
and
put
his
hand
his
side
but
sword
hung
his
belt
Where
has
Gríma
stowed
muttered
under
his
breath
Take
this
dear
lord
said
clear
voice
was
ever
your
service
Two
men
had
come
softly
the
stair
and
stood
now
few
steps
from
the
top
Éomer
was
there
helm
was
his
head
mail
was
his
breast
but
his
hand
held
drawn
sword
and
knelt
offered
the
hilt
his
master
How
comes
this
said
Théoden
sternly
turned
towards
Éomer
and
the
men
looked
wonder
him
standing
now
proud
and
erect
Where
was
the
old
man
whom
they
had
left
crouching
his
chair
leaning
his
stick
doing
lord
said
Háma
trembling
understood
that
Éomer
was
set
free
Such
joy
was
heart
that
maybe
have
erred
Yet
since
was
free
again
and
Marshal
the
Mark
brought
him
his
sword
bade
lay
your
feet
lord
said
Éomer
For
moment
silence
Théoden
stood
looking
down
Éomer
knelt
still
before
him
Neither
moved
Will
you
not
take
the
sword
said
Gandalf
Slowly
Théoden
stretched
forth
his
hand
his
fingers
took
the
hilt
seemed
the
watchers
that
firmness
and
strength
returned
his
thin
arm
Suddenly
lifted
the
blade
and
swung
shimmering
and
whistling
the
air
Then
gave
great
cry
His
voice
rang
clear
chanted
the
tongue
Rohan
call
arms
_Arise
now
arise
Riders
Théoden
Dire
deeds
awake
dark
eastward
Let
horse
bridled
horn
sounded
Forth
Eorlingas
The
guards
thinking
that
they
were
summoned
sprang
the
stair
They
looked
their
lord
amazement
and
then
one
man
they
drew
their
swords
and
laid
them
his
feet
Command
they
said
_Westu
Théoden
hál
cried
Éomer
joy
see
you
return
into
your
own
Never
again
shall
said
Gandalf
that
you
come
only
with
grief
Take
back
your
sword
Éomer
sister
son
said
the
king
Háma
and
seek
own
sword
Gríma
has
his
keeping
Bring
him
also
Now
Gandalf
you
said
that
you
had
counsel
give
would
hear
What
your
counsel
You
have
yourself
already
taken
answered
Gandalf
put
your
trust
Éomer
rather
than
man
crooked
mind
cast
aside
regret
and
fear
the
deed
hand
Every
man
that
can
ride
should
sent
west
once
Éomer
counselled
you
must
first
destroy
the
threat
Saruman
while
have
time
fail
fall
succeed
then
will
face
the
next
task
Meanwhile
your
people
that
are
left
the
women
and
the
children
and
the
old
should
stay
the
refuges
that
you
have
the
mountains
Were
they
not
prepared
against
just
such
evil
day
this
Let
them
take
provision
but
delay
not
nor
burden
themselves
with
treasures
great
small
their
lives
that
are
stake
This
counsel
seems
good
now
said
Théoden
Let
all
folk
get
ready
But
you
guests
truly
you
said
Gandalf
that
the
courtesy
hall
lessened
You
have
ridden
through
the
night
and
the
morning
wears
away
You
have
had
neither
sleep
nor
food
guest
house
shall
made
ready
there
you
shall
sleep
when
you
have
eaten
Nay
lord
said
Aragorn
There
rest
yet
for
the
weary
The
men
Rohan
must
ride
forth
today
and
will
ride
with
them
axe
sword
and
bow
did
not
bring
them
rest
against
your
wall
Lord
the
Mark
And
promised
Éomer
that
sword
and
his
should
drawn
together
Now
indeed
there
hope
victory
said
Éomer
Hope
yes
said
Gandalf
But
Isengard
strong
And
other
perils
draw
ever
nearer
not
delay
Théoden
when
are
gone
Lead
your
people
swiftly
the
Hold
Dunharrow
the
hills
Nay
Gandalf
said
the
king
You
not
know
your
own
skill
healing
shall
not
myself
will
war
fall
the
front
the
battle
must
Thus
shall
sleep
better
Then
even
the
defeat
Rohan
will
glorious
song
said
Aragorn
The
armed
men
that
stood
near
clashed
their
weapons
crying
The
Lord
the
Mark
will
ride
Forth
Eorlingas
But
your
people
must
not
both
unarmed
and
shepherdless
said
Gandalf
Who
shall
guide
them
and
govern
them
your
place
will
take
thought
for
that
ere
answered
Théoden
Here
comes
counsellor
that
moment
Háma
came
again
from
the
hall
Behind
him
cringing
between
two
other
men
came
Gríma
the
Wormtongue
His
face
was
very
white
His
eyes
blinked
the
sunlight
Háma
knelt
and
presented
Théoden
long
sword
scabbard
clasped
with
gold
and
set
with
green
gems
Here
lord
Herugrim
your
ancient
blade
said
was
found
his
chest
Loth
was
render
the
keys
Many
other
things
are
there
which
men
have
missed
You
lie
said
Wormtongue
And
this
sword
your
master
himself
gave
into
keeping
And
now
requires
you
again
said
Théoden
Does
that
displease
you
Assuredly
not
lord
said
Wormtongue
care
for
you
and
yours
best
may
But
not
weary
yourself
tax
too
heavily
your
strength
Let
others
deal
with
these
irksome
guests
Your
meat
about
set
the
board
Will
you
not
will
said
Théoden
And
let
food
for
guests
set
the
board
beside
The
host
rides
today
Send
the
heralds
forth
Let
them
summon
all
who
dwell
nigh
Every
man
and
strong
lad
able
bear
arms
all
who
have
horses
let
them
ready
the
saddle
the
gate
ere
the
second
hour
from
noon
Dear
lord
cried
Wormtongue
feared
This
wizard
has
bewitched
you
Are
none
left
defend
the
Golden
Hall
your
fathers
and
all
your
treasure
None
guard
the
Lord
the
Mark
this
bewitchment
said
Théoden
seems
more
wholesome
than
your
whisperings
Your
leechcraft
ere
long
would
have
had
walking
all
fours
like
beast
not
one
shall
left
not
even
Gríma
Gríma
shall
ride
too
You
have
yet
time
clean
the
rust
from
your
sword
Mercy
lord
whined
Wormtongue
grovelling
the
ground
Have
pity
one
worn
out
your
service
Send
not
from
your
side
least
will
stand
you
when
all
others
have
gone
not
send
your
faithful
Gríma
away
You
have
pity
said
Théoden
And
not
send
you
from
side
myself
war
with
men
bid
you
come
with
and
prove
your
faith
Wormtongue
looked
from
face
face
his
eyes
was
the
hunted
look
beast
seeking
some
gap
the
ring
his
enemies
licked
his
lips
with
long
pale
tongue
Such
resolve
might
expected
from
lord
the
House
Eorl
old
though
said
But
those
who
truly
love
him
would
spare
his
failing
years
Yet
see
that
come
too
late
Others
whom
the
death
lord
would
perhaps
grieve
less
have
already
persuaded
him
cannot
undo
their
work
hear
least
this
lord
One
who
knows
your
mind
and
honours
your
commands
should
left
Edoras
Appoint
faithful
steward
Let
your
counsellor
Gríma
keep
all
things
till
your
return
and
pray
that
may
see
though
wise
man
will
deem
hopeful
Éomer
laughed
And
that
plea
does
not
excuse
you
from
war
most
noble
Wormtongue
said
what
office
less
honour
would
you
accept
carry
sack
meal
into
the
mountains
any
man
would
trust
you
with
Nay
Éomer
you
not
fully
understand
the
mind
Master
Wormtongue
said
Gandalf
turning
his
piercing
glance
upon
him
bold
and
cunning
Even
now
plays
game
with
peril
and
wins
throw
Hours
precious
time
has
wasted
already
Down
snake
said
suddenly
terrible
voice
Down
your
belly
How
long
since
Saruman
bought
you
What
was
the
promised
price
When
all
the
men
were
dead
you
were
pick
your
share
the
treasure
and
take
the
woman
you
desire
Too
long
have
you
watched
her
under
your
eyelids
and
haunted
her
steps
Éomer
grasped
his
sword
That
knew
already
muttered
For
that
reason
would
have
slain
him
before
forgetting
the
law
the
hall
But
there
are
other
reasons
stepped
forward
but
Gandalf
stayed
him
with
his
hand
Éowyn
safe
now
said
But
you
Wormtongue
you
have
done
what
you
could
for
your
true
master
Some
reward
you
have
earned
least
Yet
Saruman
apt
overlook
his
bargains
should
advise
you
quickly
and
remind
him
lest
forget
your
faithful
service
You
lie
said
Wormtongue
That
word
comes
too
oft
and
easy
from
your
lips
said
Gandalf
not
lie
See
Théoden
here
snake
With
safety
you
cannot
take
with
you
nor
can
you
leave
behind
slay
would
just
But
was
not
always
now
Once
was
man
and
did
you
service
its
fashion
Give
him
horse
and
let
him
once
wherever
chooses
his
choice
you
shall
judge
him
you
hear
this
Wormtongue
said
Théoden
This
your
choice
ride
with
war
and
let
see
battle
whether
you
are
true
now
whither
you
will
But
then
ever
meet
again
shall
not
merciful
Slowly
Wormtongue
rose
looked
them
with
half
closed
eyes
Last
all
scanned
Théoden
face
and
opened
his
mouth
speak
Then
suddenly
drew
himself
His
hands
worked
His
eyes
glittered
Such
malice
was
them
that
men
stepped
back
from
him
bared
his
teeth
and
then
with
hissing
breath
spat
before
the
king
feet
and
darting
one
side
fled
down
the
stair
After
him
said
Théoden
See
that
does
harm
any
but
not
hurt
him
hinder
him
Give
him
horse
wishes
And
any
will
bear
him
said
Éomer
One
the
guards
ran
down
the
stair
Another
went
the
well
the
foot
the
terrace
and
his
helm
drew
water
With
washed
clean
the
stones
that
Wormtongue
had
defiled
Now
guests
come
said
Théoden
Come
and
take
such
refreshment
haste
allows
They
passed
back
into
the
great
house
Already
they
heard
below
them
the
town
the
heralds
crying
and
the
war
horns
blowing
For
the
king
was
ride
forth
soon
the
men
the
town
and
those
dwelling
near
could
armed
and
assembled
the
king
board
sat
Éomer
and
the
four
guests
and
there
also
waiting
upon
the
king
was
the
lady
Éowyn
They
ate
and
drank
swiftly
The
others
were
silent
while
Théoden
questioned
Gandalf
concerning
Saruman
How
far
back
his
treachery
goes
who
can
guess
said
Gandalf
was
not
always
evil
Once
not
doubt
that
was
the
friend
Rohan
and
even
when
his
heart
grew
colder
found
you
useful
still
But
for
long
now
has
plotted
your
ruin
wearing
the
mask
Friendship
until
was
ready
those
years
Wormtongue
task
was
easy
and
all
that
you
did
was
swiftly
known
Isengard
for
your
land
was
open
and
strangers
came
and
went
And
ever
Wormtongue
whispering
was
your
ears
poisoning
your
thought
chilling
your
heart
weakening
your
limbs
while
others
watched
and
could
nothing
for
your
will
was
his
keeping
But
when
escaped
and
warned
you
then
the
mask
was
torn
for
those
who
would
see
After
that
Wormtongue
played
dangerously
always
seeking
delay
you
prevent
your
full
strength
being
gathered
was
crafty
dulling
men
wariness
working
their
fears
served
the
occasion
you
not
remember
how
eagerly
urged
that
man
should
spared
wildgoose
chase
northward
when
the
immediate
peril
was
westward
persuaded
you
forbid
Éomer
pursue
the
raiding
Orcs
Éomer
had
not
defied
Wormtongue
voice
speaking
with
your
mouth
those
Orcs
would
have
reached
Isengard
now
bearing
great
prize
Not
indeed
that
prize
which
Saruman
desires
above
all
else
but
the
least
two
members
Company
sharers
secret
hope
which
even
you
lord
cannot
yet
speak
openly
Dare
you
think
what
they
might
now
suffering
what
Saruman
might
now
have
learned
our
destruction
owe
much
Éomer
said
Théoden
Faithful
heart
may
have
forward
tongue
Say
also
said
Gandalf
that
crooked
eyes
truth
may
wear
wry
face
Indeed
eyes
were
almost
blind
said
Théoden
Most
all
owe
you
guest
Once
again
you
have
come
time
would
give
you
gift
ere
your
own
choosing
You
have
only
name
aught
that
mine
reserve
now
only
sword
Whether
came
time
not
yet
seen
said
Gandalf
But
for
your
gift
lord
will
choose
one
that
will
fit
need
swift
and
sure
Give
Shadowfax
was
only
lent
before
loan
may
call
But
now
shall
ride
him
into
great
hazard
setting
silver
against
black
would
not
risk
anything
that
not
own
And
already
there
bond
love
between
You
choose
well
said
Théoden
and
give
him
now
gladly
Yet
great
gift
There
none
like
Shadowfax
him
one
the
mighty
steeds
old
has
returned
None
such
shall
return
again
And
you
other
guests
will
offer
such
things
may
found
armoury
Swords
you
not
need
but
there
are
helms
and
coats
mail
cunning
work
gifts
fathers
out
Gondor
Choose
from
these
ere
and
may
they
serve
you
well
Now
men
came
bearing
raiment
war
from
the
king
hoard
and
they
arrayed
Aragorn
and
Legolas
shining
mail
Helms
too
they
chose
and
round
shields
their
bosses
were
overlaid
with
gold
and
set
with
gems
green
and
red
and
white
Gandalf
took
armour
and
Gimli
needed
coat
rings
even
one
had
been
found
match
his
stature
for
there
was
hauberk
the
hoards
Edoras
better
make
than
his
short
corslet
forged
beneath
the
Mountain
the
North
But
chose
cap
iron
and
leather
that
fitted
well
upon
his
round
head
and
small
shield
also
took
bore
the
running
horse
white
upon
green
that
was
the
emblem
the
House
Eorl
May
keep
you
well
said
Théoden
was
made
for
Thengel
day
while
still
was
boy
Gimli
bowed
proud
Lord
the
Mark
bear
your
device
said
Indeed
sooner
would
bear
horse
than
borne
one
love
feet
better
But
maybe
shall
come
yet
where
can
stand
and
fight
may
well
said
Théoden
The
king
now
rose
and
once
Éowyn
came
forward
bearing
wine
_Ferthu
Théoden
hál
she
said
Receive
now
this
cup
and
drink
happy
hour
Health
with
thee
thy
going
and
coming
Théoden
drank
from
the
cup
and
she
then
proffered
the
guests
she
stood
before
Aragorn
she
paused
suddenly
and
looked
upon
him
and
her
eyes
were
shining
And
looked
down
upon
her
fair
face
and
smiled
but
took
the
cup
his
hand
met
hers
and
knew
that
she
trembled
the
touch
Hail
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
she
said
Hail
Lady
Rohan
answered
but
his
face
now
was
troubled
and
did
not
smile
When
they
had
all
drunk
the
king
went
down
the
hall
the
doors
There
the
guards
awaited
him
and
heralds
stood
and
all
the
lords
and
chiefs
were
gathered
together
that
remained
Edoras
dwelt
nearby
Behold
forth
and
seems
like
last
riding
said
Théoden
have
child
Théodred
son
slain
name
Éomer
sister
son
heir
neither
return
then
choose
new
lord
you
will
But
some
one
must
now
entrust
people
that
leave
behind
rule
them
place
Which
you
will
stay
man
spoke
there
none
whom
you
would
name
whom
people
trust
the
House
Eorl
answered
Háma
But
Éomer
cannot
spare
nor
would
stay
said
the
king
and
the
last
that
House
said
not
Éomer
answered
Háma
And
not
the
last
There
Éowyn
daughter
Éomund
his
sister
She
fearless
and
high
hearted
All
love
her
Let
her
lord
the
Eorlingas
while
are
gone
shall
said
Théoden
Let
the
heralds
announce
the
folk
that
the
Lady
Éowyn
will
lead
them
Then
the
king
sat
upon
seat
before
his
doors
and
Éowyn
knelt
before
him
and
received
from
him
sword
and
fair
corslet
Farewell
sister
daughter
said
Dark
the
hour
yet
maybe
shall
return
the
Golden
Hall
But
Dunharrow
the
people
may
long
defend
themselves
and
the
battle
ill
thither
will
come
all
who
escape
Speak
not
she
answered
year
shall
endure
for
every
day
that
passes
until
your
return
But
she
spoke
her
eyes
went
Aragorn
who
stood
nearby
The
king
shall
come
again
said
Fear
not
Not
West
but
East
does
our
doom
await
The
king
now
went
down
the
stair
with
Gandalf
beside
him
The
others
followed
Aragorn
looked
back
they
passed
towards
the
gate
Alone
Éowyn
stood
before
the
doors
the
house
the
stair
head
the
sword
was
set
upright
before
her
and
her
hands
were
laid
upon
the
hilt
She
was
clad
now
mail
and
shone
like
silver
the
sun
Gimli
walked
with
Legolas
his
axe
his
shoulder
Well
last
set
off
said
Men
need
many
words
before
deeds
axe
restless
hands
Though
doubt
not
that
these
Rohirrim
are
fell
handed
when
they
come
Nonetheless
this
not
the
warfare
that
suits
How
shall
come
the
battle
wish
could
walk
and
not
bump
like
sack
Gandalf
saddlebow
safer
seat
than
many
guess
said
Legolas
Yet
doubtless
Gandalf
will
gladly
put

Men
said
Gimli
patting
the

his
axe
the
gate
they
found
great
host
men
old
and
young
all
ready
the
saddle
More
than
thousand
were
there
mustered
Their
spears
were
like
springing
wood
Loudly
and
joyously
they
shouted
Théoden
came
forth
Some
held
readiness
the
king
horse
Snowmane
and
others
held
the
horses
Aragorn
and
Legolas
Gimli
stood
ill
ease
frowning
but
Éomer
came
him
leading
his
horse
Hail
Gimli
Glóin
son
cried
have
not
had
time
learn
gentle
speech
under
your

But
shall
not
put

our
quarrel
least
will
speak
evil
again
the
Lady
the
Wood
will
forget
wrath
for

Éomer
son
Éomund
said
Gimli
but
ever
you
chance
see
the
Lady
Galadriel
with
your
eyes
then
you
shall
acknowledge
her
the
fairest

Éomer
But

said
Gimli

said
Éomer
Legolas
upon

and
Aragorn
upon

and
none
will
dare
stand
before
Where
Shadowfax
said
Gandalf
Running
wild
over
the
grass
they
answered
will
let
man
handle
him
There
goes
away
down
the
ford
like
shadow
among
the
willows
Gandalf
whistled
and
called
aloud
the
horse
name
and
far
away
tossed
his
head
and
neighed
and
turning
sped
towards
the
host
like
arrow
Were
the
breath
the
West
Wind
take
body
visible
even
would
appear
said
Éomer
the
great
horse
ran
until
stood
before
the
wizard
The
gift
seems
already
given
said
Théoden
But

Here

Théoden
King
said
Gandalf
Then
suddenly
threw
back
his
grey
cloak
and
cast
aside
his
hat
and
leaped
horseback
wore
helm
nor
mail
His
snowy
hair
flew
free
the
wind
his
white
robes
shone
dazzling
the
sun
Behold
the
White
Rider
cried
Aragorn
and
all
took
the
words
Our
King
and
the
White
Rider
they
shouted
Forth
Eorlingas
The
trumpets
sounded
The
horses
reared
and
neighed
Spear
clashed
shield
Then
the
king
raised
his
hand
and
with
rush
like
the
sudden
onset
great
wind
the
last
host
Rohan
rode
thundering
into
the
West
Far
over
the
plain
Éowyn
saw
the
glitter
their
spears
she
stood
still
alone
before
the
doors
the
silent
house
_Chapter
Helm
Deep
The
sun
was
already
westering
they
rode
from
Edoras
and
the
light
was
their
eyes
turning
all
the
rolling
fields
Rohan
golden
haze
There
was
beaten
way
north
westward
along
the
foot
hills
the
White
Mountains
and
this
they
followed
and
down
green
country
crossing
small
swift
streams
many
fords
Far
ahead
and
their
right
the
Misty
Mountains
loomed
ever
darker
and
taller
they
grew
the
miles
went
The
sun
went
slowly
down
before
them
Evening
came
behind
The
host
rode
Need
drove
them
Fearing
come
too
late
they
rode
with
all
the
speed
they
could
pausing
seldom
Swift
and
enduring
were
the
steeds
Rohan
but
there
were
many
leagues
Forty
leagues
and
more
was
bird
flies
from
Edoras
the
fords
the
Isen
where
they
hoped
find
the
king
men
that
held
back
the
hosts
Saruman
Night
closed
about
them
last
they
halted
make
their
camp
They
had
ridden
for
some
five
hours
and
were
far
out
upon
the
western
plain
yet
more
than
half
their
journey
lay
still
before
them
great
circle
under
the
starry
sky
and
the
waxing
moon
they
now
made
their
bivouac
They
lit
fires
for
they
were
uncertain
events
but
they
set
ring
mounted
guards
about
them
and
scouts
rode
out
far
ahead
passing
like
shadows
the
folds
the
land
The
slow
night
passed
without
tidings
alarm
dawn
the
horns
sounded
and
within
hour
they
took
the
road
again
There
were
clouds
overhead
yet
but
heaviness
was
the
air
was
hot
for
the
season
the
year
The
rising
sun
was
hazy
and
behind
following
slowly
the
sky
there
was
growing
darkness
great
storm
moving
out
the
East
And
away
the
North
west
there
seemed
another
darkness
brooding
about
the
feet
the
Misty
Mountains
shadow
that
crept
down
slowly
from
the
Wizard
Vale
Gandalf
dropped
back
where
Legolas
rode
beside
Éomer
You
have
the
keen
eyes
your
fair
kindred
Legolas
said
and
they
can
tell
sparrow
from
finch
league
off
Tell
can
you
sec
anything
away
yonder
towards
Isengard
Many
miles
lie
between
said
Legolas
gazing
thither
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
long
hand
can
see
darkness
There
are
shapes
moving
great
shapes
far
away
upon
the
bank
the
river
but
what
they
are
cannot
tell
not
mist
cloud
that
defeats
eyes
there
veiling
shadow
that
some
power
lays
upon
the
land
and
marches
slowly
down
stream
the
twilight
under
endless
trees
were
flowing
downwards
from
the
hills
And
behind
comes
very
storm
Mordor
said
Gandalf
will
black
night
the
second
day
their
riding
drew
the
heaviness
the
air
increased
the
afternoon
the
dark
clouds
began
overtake
them
sombre
canopy
with
great
billowing
edges
flecked
with
dazzling
light
The
sun
went
down
blood
red
smoking
haze
The
spears
the
Riders
were
tipped
with
fire
the
last
shafts
light
kindled
the
steep
faces
the
peaks
Thrihyrne
now
very
near
they
stood
the
northernmost
arm
the
White
Mountains
three
jagged
horns
staring
the
sunset
the
last
red
glow
men
the
vanguard
saw
black
speck
horseman
riding
back
towards
them
They
halted
awaiting
him
came
weary
man
with
dinted
helm
and
cloven
shield
Slowly
climbed
from
his
horse
and
stood
there
while
gasping
length
spoke
Éomer
here
asked
You
come
last
but
too
late
and
with
too
little
strength
Things
have
gone
evilly
since
Théodred
fell
were
driven
back
yesterday
over
the
Isen
with
great
loss
many
perished
the
crossing
Then
night
fresh
forces
came
over
the
river
against
our
camp
All
Isengard
must
emptied
and
Saruman
has
armed
the
wild
hillmen
and
herd
folk
Dunland
beyond
the
rivers
and
these
also
loosed
upon
were
overmastered
The
shield
wall
was
broken
Erkenbrand
Westfold
has
drawn
off
those
men
could
gather
towards
his
fastness
Helm
Deep
The
rest
are
scattered
Where
Éomer
Tell
him
there
hope
ahead
should
return
Edoras
before
the
wolves
Isengard
come
there
Théoden
had
sat
silent
hidden
from
the
man
sight
behind
his
guards
now
urged
his
horse
forward
Come
stand
before
Ceorl
said
here
The
last
host
the
Eorlingas
has
ridden
forth
will
not
return
without
battle
The
man
face
lightened
with
joy
and
wonder
drew
himself
Then
knelt
offering
his
notched
sword
the
king
Command
lord
cried
And
pardon
thought
You
thought
remained
Meduseld
bent
like
old
tree
under
winter
snow
was
when
you
rode
war
But
west
wind
has
shaken
the
boughs
said
Théoden
Give
this
man
fresh
horse
Let
ride
the
help
Erkenbrand
While
Théoden
was
speaking
Gandalf
rode
short
way
ahead
and
sat
there
alone
gazing
north
Isengard
and
west
the
setting
sun
Now
came
back
Ride
Théoden
said
Ride
Helm
Deep
not
the
Fords
Isen
and
not
tarry
the
plain
must
leave
you
for
while
Shadowfax
must
bear
now
swift
errand
Turning
Aragorn
and
Éomer
and
the
men
the
king
household
cried
Keep
well
the
Lord
the
Mark
till
return
Await
Helm
Gate
Farewell
spoke
word
Shadowfax
and
like
arrow
from
the
bow
the
great
horse
sprang
away
Even
they
looked
was
gone
flash
silver
the
sunset
wind
over
the
grass
shadow
that
fled
and
passed
from
sight
Snowmane
snorted
and
reared
eager
follow
but
only
swift
bird
the
wing
could
have
overtaken
him
What
does
that
mean
said
one
the
guard
Háma
That
Gandalf
Greyhame
has
need
haste
answered
Háma
Ever
goes
and
comes
unlooked
for
Wormtongue
were
here
would
not
find
hard
explain
Said
the
other
True
enough
said
Háma
but
for
myself
will
wait
until
see
Gandalf
again
Maybe
you
will
wait
long
said
the
other
The
host
turned
away
now
from
the
road
the
Fords
Isen
and
bent
their
course
southward
Night
fell
and
still
they
rode
The
hills
drew
near
but
the
tall
peaks
Thrihyrne
were
already
dim
against
the
darkening
sky
Still
some
miles
away
the
far
side
the
Westfold
Vale
lay
green
coomb
great
bay
the
mountains
out
which
gorge
opened
the
hills
Men
that
land
called
Helm
Deep
after
hero
old
wars
who
had
made
his
refuge
there
Ever
steeper
and
narrower
wound
inward
from
the
north
under
the
shadow
the
Thrihyrne
till
the
crow
haunted
cliffs
rose
like
mighty
towers
either
side
shutting
out
the
light
Helm
Gate
before
the
mouth
the
Deep
there
was
heel
rock
thrust
outward
the
northern
cliff
There
upon
its
spur
stood
high
walls
ancient
stone
and
within
them
was
lofty
tower
Men
said
that
the
far
off
days
the
glory
Gondor
the
sea
kings
had
built
here
this
fastness
with
the
hands
giants
The
Hornburg
was
called
for
trumpet
sounded
upon
the
tower
echoed
the
Deep
behind
armies
long
forgotten
were
issuing
war
from
caves
beneath
the
hills
wall
too
the
men
old
had
made
from
the
Hornburg
the
southern
cliff
barring
the
entrance
the
gorge
Beneath
wide
culvert
the
Deeping
stream
passed
out
About
the
feet
the
Hornrock
wound
and
flowed
then
gully
through
the
midst
wide
green
gore
sloping
gently
down
from
Helm
Gate
Helm
Dike
Thence
fell
into
the
Deeping
coomb
and
out
into
the
Westfold
Vale
There
the
Hornburg
Helm
Gate
Erkenbrand
master
Westfold
the
borders
the
Mark
now
dwelt
the
days
darkened
with
threat
war
being
wise
had
repaired
the
wall
and
made
the
fastness
strong
The
Riders
were
still
the
low
valley
before
the
mouth
the
Coomb
when
cries
and
hornblasts
were
heard
from
their
scouts
that
went
front
Out
the
darkness
arrows
whistled
Swiftly
scout
rode
back
and
reported
that
wolf
riders
were
abroad
the
valley
and
that
host
Orcs
and
wild
men
were
hurrying
southward
from
the
Fords
Isen
and
seemed
making
for
Helm
Deep
have
found
many
our
folk
lying
slain
they
fled
thither
said
the
scout
And
have
met
scattered
companies
going
this
way
and
that
leaderless
What
has
become
Erkenbrand
none
seem
know
likely
that
will
overtaken
ere
can
reach
Helm
Gate
has
not
already
perished
Has
aught
been
seen
Gandalf
asked
Théoden
Yes
lord
Many
have
seen
old
man
white
upon
horse
passing
hither
and
thither
over
the
plains
like
wind
the
grass
Some
thought
was
Saruman
said
that
went
away
ere
nightfall
towards
Isengard
Some
say
also
that
Wormtongue
was
seen
earlier
going
northward
with
company
Orcs
will
ill
with
Wormtongue
Gandalf
comes
upon
him
said
Théoden
Nonetheless
miss
now
both
counsellors
the
old
and
the
new
But
this
need
have
better
choice
than
Gandalf
said
Helm
Gate
whether
Erkenbrand
there
known
how
great
the
host
that
comes
from
the
North
very
great
said
the
scout
that
flies
counts
every
foeman
twice
yet
have
spoken
stouthearted
men
and
not
doubt
that
the
main
strength
the
enemy
many
times
great
all
that
have
here
Then
let
swift
said
Éomer
Let
drive
through
such
foes
are
already
between
and
the
fastness
There
are
caves
Helm
Deep
where
hundreds
may
lie
hid
and
secret
ways
lead
thence
the
hills
Trust
not
secret
ways
said
the
king
Saruman
has
long
spied
out
this
land
Still
that
place
our
defence
may
last
long
Let
Aragorn
and
Legolas
went
now
with
Éomer
the
van
through
the
dark
night
they
rode
ever
slower
the
darkness
deepened
and
their
way
climbed
southward
higher
and
higher
into
the
dim
folds
about
the
mountains
feet
They
found
few
the
enemy
before
them
Here
and
there
they
came
upon
roving
bands
Orcs
but
they
fled
ere
the
Riders
could
take
slay
them
will
not
long
fear
said
Éomer
ere
the
coming
the
king
host
will
known
the
leader
our
enemies
Saruman
whatever
captain
has
sent
forth
The
rumour
war
grew
behind
them
Now
they
could
hear
borne
over
the
dark
the
sound
harsh
singing
They
had
climbed
far
into
the
Deeping
coomb
when
they
looked
back
Then
they
saw
torches
countless
points
fiery
light
upon
the
black
fields
behind
scattered
like
red
flowers
winding
from
the
lowlands
long
flickering
lines
Here
and
there
larger
blaze
leapt
great
host
and
follows
hard
said
Aragorn
They
bring
fire
said
Théoden
and
they
are
burning
they
come
rick
cot
and
tree
This
was
rich
vale
and
had
many
homesteads
Alas
for
folk
Would
that
day
was
here
and
might
ride
down
upon
them
like
storm
out
the
mountains
said
Aragorn
grieves
fly
before
them
need
not
fly
much
further
said
Éomer
Not
far
ahead
now
lies
Helm
Dike
ancient
trench
and
rampart
scored
across
the
coomb
two
furlongs
below
Helm
Gate
There
can
turn
and
give
battle
Nay
are
too
few
defend
the
Dike
said
Théoden
mile
long
more
and
the
breach
wide
the
breach
our
rearguard
must
stand
are
pressed
said
Éomer
There
was
neither
star
nor
moon
when
the
Riders
came
the
breach
the
Dike
where
the
stream
from
above
passed
out
and
the
road
beside
ran
down
from
the
Hornburg
The
rampart
loomed
suddenly
before
them
high
shadow
beyond
dark
pit
they
rode
sentinel
challenged
them
The
Lord
the
Mark
rides
Helm
Gate
Éomer
answered
Éomer
son
Éomund
speak
This
good
tidings
beyond
hope
said
the
sentinel
Hasten
The
enemy
your
heels
The
host
passed
through
the
breach
and
halted
the
sloping
sward
above
They
now
learned
their
joy
that
Erkenbrand
had
left
many
men
hold
Helm
Gate
and
more
had
since
escaped
thither
Maybe
have
thousand
fit
fight
foot
said
Gamling
old
man
the
leader
those
that
watched
the
Dike
But
most
them
have
seen
too
many
winters
have
too
few
son
son
here
What
news
Erkenbrand
Word
came
yesterday
that
was
retreating
hither
with
all
that
left
the
best
Riders
Westfold
But
has
not
come
fear
that
will
not
come
now
said
Éomer
Our
scouts
have
gained
news
him
and
the
enemy
fills
all
the
valley
behind
would
that
had
escaped
said
Théoden
was
mighty
man
him
lived
again
the
valour
Helm
the
Hammerhand
But
cannot
await
him
here
must
draw
all
our
forces
now
behind
the
walls
Are
you
well
stored
bring
little
provision
for
rode
forth
open
battle
not
siege
Behind
the
caves
the
Deep
are
three
parts
the
folk
Westfold
old
and
young
children
and
women
said
Gamling
But
great
store
food
and
many
beasts
and
their
fodder
have
also
been
gathered
there
That
well
said
Éomer
They
are
burning
despoiling
all
that
left
the
vale
they
come
bargain
for
our
goods
Helm
Gate
they
will
pay
high
price
said
Gamling
The
king
and
his
Riders
passed
Before
the
causeway
that
crossed
the
stream
they
dismounted
long
file
they
led
their
horses
the
ramp
and
passed
within
the
gates
the
Hornburg
There
they
were
welcomed
again
with
joy
and
renewed
hope
for
now
there
were
men
enough
man
both
the
burg
and
the
barrier
wall
Quickly
Éomer
set
his
men
readiness
The
king
and
the
men
his
household
were
the
Hornburg
and
there
also
were
many
the
Westfold
men
But
the
Deeping
Wall
and
its
tower
and
behind
Éomer
arrayed
most
the
strength
that
had
for
here
the
defence
seemed
more
doubtful
the
assault
were
determined
and
great
force
The
horses
were
led
far
the
Deep
under
such
guard
could
spared
The
Deeping
Wall
was
twenty
feet
high
and
thick
that
four
men
could
walk
abreast
along
the
top
sheltered
parapet
over
which
only
tall
man
could
look
Here
and
there
were
clefts
the
stone
through
which
men
could
shoot
This
battlement
could
reached
stair
running
down
from
door
the
outer
court
the
Hornburg
three
flights
steps
led
also
the
wall
from
the
Deep
behind
but
front
was
smooth
and
the
great
stones
were
set
with
such
skill
that
foothold
could
found
their
joints
and
the
top
they
hung
over
like
sea
delved
cliff
Gimli
stood
leaning
against
the
breastwork
upon
the
wall
Legolas
sat
above
the
parapet
fingering
his
bow
and
peering
out
into
the
gloom
This
more
liking
said
the
dwarf
stamping
the
stones
Ever
heart
rises
draw
near
the
mountains
There
good
rock
here
This
country
has
tough
bones
felt
them
feet
came
from
the
dike
Give
year
and
hundred
kin
and
would
make
this
place
that
armies
would
break
upon
like
water
not
doubt
said
Legolas
But
you
are
dwarf
and
dwarves
are
strange
folk
not
like
this
place
and
shall
like
more
the
light
day
But
you
comfort
Gimli
and
glad
have
you
standing
nigh
with
your
stout
legs
and
your
hard
axe
wish
there
were
more
your
kin
among
But
even
more
would
give
for
hundred
good
archers
Mirkwood
shall
need
them
The
Rohirrim
have
good
bowmen
after
their
fashion
but
there
are
too
few
here
too
few
dark
for
archery
said
Gimli
Indeed
time
for
sleep
Sleep
feel
the
need
never
thought
any
dwarf
could
Riding
tiring
work
Yet
axe
restless
hand
Give
row
orc
necks
and
room
swing
and
all
weariness
will
fall
from
slow
time
passed
Far
down
the
valley
scattered
fires
still
burned
The
hosts
Isengard
were
advancing
silence
now
Their
torches
could
seen
winding
the
coomb
many
lines
Suddenly
from
the
Dike
yells
and
screams
and
the
fierce
battle
cries
men
broke
out
Flaming
brands
appeared
over
the
brink
and
clustered
thickly
the
breach
Then
they
scattered
and
vanished
Men
came
galloping
back
over
the
field
and
the
ramp
the
gate
the
Hornburg
The
rearguard
the
Westfolders
had
been
driven
The
enemy
hand
they
said
loosed
every
arrow
that
had
and
filled
the
Dike
with
Orcs
But
will
not
halt
them
long
Already
they
are
scaling
the
bank
many
points
thick
marching
ants
But
have
taught
them
not
carry
torches
was
now
past
midnight
The
sky
was
utterly
dark
and
the
stillness
the
heavy
air
foreboded
storm
Suddenly
the
clouds
were
seared
blinding
flash
Branched
lightning
smote
down
upon
the
eastward
hills
For
staring
moment
the
watchers
the
walls
saw
all
the
space
between
them
and
the
Dike
lit
with
white
light
was
boiling
and
crawling
with
black
shapes
some
squat
and
broad
some
tall
and
grim
with
high
helms
and
sable
shields
Hundreds
and
hundreds
more
were
pouring
over
the
Dike
and
through
the
breach
The
dark
tide
flowed
the
walls
from
cliff
cliff
Thunder
rolled
the
valley
Rain
came
lashing
down
Arrows
thick
the
rain
came
whistling
over
the
battlements
and
fell
clinking
and
glancing
the
stones
Some
found
mark
The
assault
Helm
Deep
had
begun
but
sound
challenge
was
heard
within
answering
arrows
came
The
assailing
hosts
halted
foiled
the
silent
menace
rock
and
wall
Ever
and
again
the
lightning
tore
aside
the
darkness
Then
the
Orcs
screamed
waving
spear
and
sword
and
shooting
cloud
arrows
any
that
stood
revealed
upon
the
battlements
and
the
men
the
Mark
amazed
looked
out
seemed
them
upon
great
field
dark
corn
tossed
tempest
war
and
every
ear
glinted
with
barbed
light
Brazen
trumpets
sounded
The
enemy
surged
forward
some
against
the
Deeping
Wall
other
towards
the
causeway
and
the
ramp
that
led
the
Hornburg
gates
There
the
hugest
Orcs
were
mustered
and
the
wild
men
the
Dunland
fells
moment
they
hesitated
and
then
they
came
The
lightning
flashed
and
blazoned
upon
every
helm
and
shield
the
ghastly
hand
Isengard
was
seen
They
reached
the
summit
the
rock
they
drove
towards
the
gates
Then
last
answer
came
storm
arrows
met
them
and
hail
stones
They
wavered
broke
and
fled
back
and
then
charged
again
broke
and
charged
again
and
each
time
like
the
incoming
sea
they
halted
higher
point
Again
trumpets
rang
and
press
roaring
men
leaped
forth
They
held
their
great
shields
above
them
like
roof
while
their
midst
they
bore
two
trunks
mighty
trees
Behind
them
orc
archers
crowded
sending
hail
darts
against
the
bowmen
the
walls
They
gained
the
gates
The
trees
swung
strong
arms
smote
the
timbers
with
rending
boom
any
man
fell
crushed
stone
hurtling
from
above
two
others
sprang
take
his
place
Again
and
again
the
great
rams
swung
and
crashed
Éomer
and
Aragorn
stood
together
the
Deeping
Wall
They
heard
the
roar
voices
and
the
thudding
the
rams
and
then
sudden
flash
light
they
beheld
the
peril
the
gates
Come
said
Aragorn
This
the
hour
when
draw
swords
together
Running
like
fire
they
sped
along
the
wall
and
the
steps
and
passed
into
the
outer
court
upon
the
Rock
they
ran
they
gathered
handful
stout
swordsmen
There
was
small
postern
door
that
opened
angle
the
burg
wall
the
west
where
the
cliff
stretched
out
meet
that
side
narrow
path
ran
round
towards
the
great
gate
between
the
wall
and
the
sheer
brink
the
Rock
Together
Éomer
and
Aragorn
sprang
through
the
door
their
men
close
behind
The
swords
flashed
from
the
sheath
one
Gúthwinë
cried
Éomer
Gúthwinë
for
the
Mark
Andúril
cried
Aragorn
Andúril
for
the
Dúnedain
Charging
from
the
side
they
hurled
themselves
upon
the
wild
men
Andúril
rose
and
fell
gleaming
with
white
fire
shout
went
from
wall
and
tower
Andúril
Andúril
goes
war
The
Blade
that
was
Broken
shines
again
Dismayed
the
rammers
let
fall
the
trees
and
turned
fight
but
the
wall
their
shields
was
broken
lightning
stroke
and
they
were
swept
away
hewn
down
cast
over
the
Rock
into
the
stony
stream
below
The
orc
archers
shot
wildly
and
then
fled
For
moment
Éomer
and
Aragorn
halted
before
the
gates
The
thunder
was
rumbling
the
distance
now
The
lightning
flickered
still
far
off
among
the
mountains
the
South
keen
wind
was
blowing
from
the
North
again
The
clouds
were
torn
and
drifting
and
stars
peeped
out
and
above
the
hills
the
Coomb
side
the
westering
moon
rode
glimmering
yellow
the
storm
wrack
did
not
come
too
soon
said
Aragorn
looking
the
gates
Their
great
hinges
and
iron
bars
were
wrenched
and
bent
many
their
timbers
were
cracked
Yet
cannot
stay
here
beyond
the
walls
defend
them
said
Éomer
Look
pointed
the
causeway
Already
great
press
Orcs
and
Men
were
gathering
again
beyond
the
stream
Arrows
whined
and
skipped
the
stones
about
them
Come
must
get
back
and
see
what
can
pile
stone
and
beam
across
the
gates
within
Come
now
They
turned
and
ran
that
moment
some
dozen
Orcs
that
had
lain
motionless
among
the
slain
leaped
their
feet
and
came
silently
and
swiftly
behind
Two
flung
themselves
the
ground
Éomer
heels
tripped
him
and
moment
they
were
top
him
But
small
dark
figure
that
none
had
observed
sprang
out
the
shadows
and
gave
hoarse
shout
Baruk
Khazâd
Khazâd
mênu
axe
swung
and
swept
back
Two
Orcs
fell
headless
The
rest
fled
Éomer
struggled
his
feet
even
Aragorn
ran
back
his
aid
The
postern
was
closed
again
the
iron
door
was
barred
and
piled
inside
with
stones
When
all
were
safe
within
Éomer
turned
thank
you
Gimli
son
Glóin
said
did
not
know
that
you
were
with
the
sortie
But
oft
the
unbidden
guest
proves
the
best
company
How
came
you
there
followed
you
shake
off
sleep
said
Gimli
but
looked
the
hillmen
and
they
seemed
over
large
for
sat
beside
stone
see
your
sword
play
shall
not
find
easy
repay
you
said
Éomer
There
may
many
chance
ere
the
night
over
laughed
the
Dwarf
But
content
Till
now
have
hewn
naught
but
wood
since
left
Moria
Two
said
Gimli
patting
his
axe
had
returned
his
place
the
wall
Two
said
Legolas
have
done
better
though
now
must
grope
for
spent
arrows
all
mine
are
gone
Yet
make
tale
twenty
the
least
But
that
only
few
leaves
forest
The
sky
now
was
quickly
clearing
and
the
sinking
moon
was
shining
brightly
But
the
light
brought
little
hope
the
Riders
the
Mark
The
enemy
before
them
seemed
have
grown
rather
than
diminished
still
more
were
pressing
from
the
valley
through
the
breach
The
sortie
upon
the
Rock
gained
only
brief
respite
The
assault
the
gates
was
redoubled
Against
the
Deeping
Wall
the
hosts
Isengard
roared
like
sea
Orcs
and
hillmen
swarmed
about
its
feet
from
end
end
Ropes
with
grappling
hooks
were
hurled
over
the
parapet
faster
than
men
could
cut
them
fling
them
back
Hundreds
long
ladders
were
lifted
Many
were
cast
down
ruin
but
many
more
replaced
them
and
Orcs
sprang
them
like
apes
the
dark
forests
the
South
Before
the
wall
foot
the
dead
and
broken
were
piled
like
shingle
storm
ever
higher
rose
the
hideous
mounds
and
still
the
enemy
came
The
men
Rohan
grew
weary
All
their
arrows
were
spent
and
every
shaft
was
shot
their
swords
were
notched
and
their
shields
were
riven
Three
times
Aragorn
and
Éomer
rallied
them
and
three
times
Andúril
flamed
desperate
charge
that
drove
the
enemy
from
the
wall
Then
clamour
arose
the
Deep
behind
Orcs
had
crept
like
rats
through
the
culvert
through
which
the
stream
flowed
out
There
they
had
gathered
the
shadow
the
cliffs
until
the
assault
above
was
hottest
and
nearly
all
the
men
the
defence
had
rushed
the
wall
top
Then
they
sprang
out
Already
some
had
passed
into
the
jaws
the
Deep
and
were
among
the
horses
fighting
with
the
guards
Down
from
the
wall
leapt
Gimli
with
fierce
cry
that
echoed
the
cliffs
Khazâd
Khazâd
soon
had
work
enough
shouted
The
Orcs
are
behind
the
wall
Come
Legolas
There
are
enough
for
both
_Khazâd
mênu
Gamling
the
Old
looked
down
from
the
Hornburg
hearing
the
great
voice
the
dwarf
above
all
the
tumult
The
Orcs
are
the
Deep
cried
Helm
Helm
Forth
Helmingas
shouted
leaped
down
the
stair
from
the
Rock
with
many
men
Westfold
his
back
Their
onset
was
fierce
and
sudden
and
the
Orcs
gave
way
before
them
Ere
long
they
were
hemmed
the
narrows
the
gorge
and
all
were
slain
driven
shrieking
into
the
chasm
the
Deep
fall
before
the
guardians
the
hidden
caves
Twenty
one
cried
Gimli
hewed
two
handed
stroke
and
laid
the
last
Orc
before
his
feet
Now
count
passes
Master
Legolas
again
must
stop
this
rat
hole
said
Gamling
Dwarves
are
said
cunning
folk
with
stone
Lend
your
aid
master
not
shape
stone
with
battle
axes
nor
with
our
finger
nails
said
Gimli
But
will
help
may
They
gathered
such
small
boulders
and
broken
stones
they
could
find
hand
and
under
Gimli
direction
the
Westfold
men
blocked
the
inner
end
the
culvert
until
only
narrow
outlet
remained
Then
the
Deeping
stream
swollen
the
rain
churned
and
fretted
its
choked
path
and
spread
slowly
cold
pools
from
cliff
cliff
will
drier
above
said
Gimli
Come
Gamling
let
see
how
things
the
wall
climbed
and
found
Legolas
beside
Aragorn
and
Éomer
The
elf
was
whetting
his
long
knife
There
was
for
while
lull
the
assault
since
the
attempt
break
through
the
culvert
had
been
foiled
Twenty
one
said
Gimli
Good
said
Legolas
But
count
now
two
dozen
has
been
knife
work
here
Éomer
and
Aragorn
leant
wearily
their
swords
Away
the
left
the
crash
and
clamour
the
battle
the
Rock
rose
loud
again
But
the
Hornburg
still
held
fast
like
island
the
sea
Its
gates
lay
ruin
but
over
the
barricade
beams
and
stones
within
enemy
yet
had
passed
Aragorn
looked
the
pale
stars
and
the
moon
now
sloping
behind
the
western
hills
that
enclosed
the
valley
This
night
long
years
said
How
long
will
the
day
tarry
Dawn
not
far
off
said
Gamling
who
had
now
climbed
beside
him
But
dawn
will
not
help
fear
Yet
dawn
ever
the
hope
men
said
Aragorn
But
these
creatures
Isengard
these
half
orcs
and
goblin
men
that
the
foul
craft
Saruman
has
bred
they
will
not
quail
the
sun
said
Gamling
And
neither
will
the
wild
men
the
hills
you
not
hear
their
voices
hear
them
said
Éomer
but
they
are
only
the
scream
birds
and
the
bellowing
beasts
ears
Yet
there
are
many
that
cry
the
Dunland
tongue
said
Gamling
know
that
tongue
ancient
speech
men
and
once
was
spoken
many
western
valleys
the
Mark
Hark
They
hate
and
they
are
glad
for
our
doom
seems
certain
them
The
king
the
king
they
cry
will
take
their
king
Death
the
Forgoil
Death
the
Strawheads
Death
the
robbers
the
North
Such
names
they
have
for
Not
half
thousand
years
have
they
forgotten
their
grievance
that
the
lords
Gondor
gave
the
Mark
Eorl
the
Young
and
made
alliance
with
him
That
old
hatred
Saruman
has
inflamed
They
are
fierce
folk
when
roused
They
will
not
give
way
now
for
dusk
dawn
until
Théoden
taken
they
themselves
are
slain
Nonetheless
day
will
bring
hope
said
Aragorn
not
said
that
foe
has
ever
taken
the
Hornburg
men
defended
the
minstrels
say
said
Éomer
Then
let
defend
and
hope
said
Aragorn
Even
they
spoke
there
came
blare
trumpets
Then
there
was
crash
and
flash
flame
and
smoke
The
waters
the
Deeping
stream
poured
out
hissing
and
foaming
they
were
choked
longer
gaping
hole
was
blasted
the
wall
host
dark
shapes
poured
Devilry
Saruman
cried
Aragorn
They
have
crept
the
culvert
again
while
talked
and
they
have
lit
the
fire
Orthanc
beneath
our
feet
_Elendil
Elendil
shouted
leaped
down
into
the
breach
but
even
did
hundred
ladders
were
raised
against
the
battlements
Over
the
wall
and
under
the
wall
the
last
assault
came
sweeping
like
dark
wave
upon
hill
sand
The
defence
was
swept
away
Some
the
Riders
were
driven
back
further
and
further
into
the
Deep
falling
and
fighting
they
gave
way
step
step
towards
the
caves
Others
cut
their
way
back
towards
the
citadel
broad
stairway
climbed
from
the
Deep
the
Rock
and
the
rear
gate
the
Hornburg
Near
the
bottom
stood
Aragorn
his
hand
still
Andúril
gleamed
and
the
terror
the
sword
for
while
held
back
the
enemy
one
one
all
who
could
gain
the
stair
passed
towards
the
gate
Behind
the
upper
steps
knelt
Legolas
His
bow
was
bent
but
one
gleaned
arrow
was
all
that
had
left
and
peered
out
now
ready
shoot
the
first
Orc
that
should
dare
approach
the
stair
All
who
can
have
now
got
safe
within
Aragorn
called
Come
back
Aragorn
turned
and
sped
the
stair
but
ran
stumbled
his
weariness
once
his
enemies
leapt
forward
came
the
Orcs
yelling
with
their
long
arms
stretched
out
seize
him
The
foremost
fell
with
Legolas
last
arrow
his
throat
but
the
rest
sprang
over
him
Then
great
boulder
cast
from
the
outer
wall
above
crashed
down
upon
the
stair
and
hurled
them
back
into
the
Deep
Aragorn
gained
the
door
and
swiftly
clanged
behind
him
Things
ill
friends
said
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
brow
with
his
arm
Ill
enough
said
Legolas
but
not
yet
hopeless
while
have
you
with
Where
Gimli
not
know
said
Aragorn
last
saw
him
fighting
the
ground
behind
the
wall
but
the
enemy
swept
apart
Alas
That
evil
news
said
Legolas
stout
and
strong
said
Aragorn
Let
hope
that
will
escape
back
the
caves
There
would
safe
for
while
Safer
than
Such
refuge
would
the
liking
dwarf
That
must
hope
said
Legolas
But
wish
that
had
come
this
way
desired
tell
Master
Gimli
that
tale
now
thirty
nine
wins
back
the
caves
will
pass
your
count
again
laughed
Aragorn
Never
did
see
axe
wielded
must
and
seek
some
arrows
said
Legolas
Would
that
this
night
would
end
and
could
have
better
light
for
shooting
Aragorn
now
passed
into
the
citadel
There
his
dismay
learned
that
Éomer
had
not
reached
the
Hornburg
Nay
did
not
come
the
Rock
said
one
the
Westfold
men
last
saw
him
gathering
men
about
him
and
fighting
the
mouth
the
Deep
Gamling
was
with
him
and
the
dwarf
but
could
not
come
them
Aragorn
strode
through
the
inner
court
and
mounted
high
chamber
the
tower
There
stood
the
king
dark
against
narrow
window
looking
out
upon
the
vale
What
the
news
Aragorn
said
The
Deeping
Wall
taken
lord
and
all
the
defence
swept
away
but
many
have
escaped
hither
the
Rock
Éomer
here
lord
But
many
your
men
retreated
into
the
Deep
and
some
say
that
Éomer
was
amongst
them
the
narrows
they
may
hold
back
the
enemy
and
come
within
the
caves
What
hope
they
may
have
then
not
know
More
than
Good
provision
said
And
the
air
wholesome
there
because
the
outlets
through
fissures
the
rock
far
above
None
can
force
entrance
against
determined
men
They
may
hold
out
long
But
the
Orcs
have
brought
devilry
from
Orthanc
said
Aragorn
They
have
blasting
fire
and
with
they
took
the
Wall
they
cannot
come
the
caves
they
may
seal
those
that
are
inside
But
now
must
turn
all
our
thoughts
our
own
defence
fret
this
prison
said
Théoden
could
have
set
spear
rest
riding
before
men
upon
the
field
maybe
could
have
felt
again
the
joy
battle
and
ended
But
serve
little
purpose
here
Here
least
you
are
guarded
the
strongest
fastness
the
Mark
said
Aragorn
More
hope
have
defend
you
the
Hornburg
than
Edoras
even
Dunharrow
the
mountains
said
that
the
Hornburg
has
never
fallen
assault
said
Théoden
but
now
heart
doubtful
The
world
changes
and
all
that
once
was
strong
now
proves
unsure
How
shall
any
tower
withstand
such
numbers
and
such
reckless
hate
Had
known
that
the
strength
Isengard
was
grown
great
maybe
should
not
rashly
have
ridden
forth
meet
for
all
the
arts
Gandalf
His
counsel
seems
not
now
good
did
under
the
morning
sun
not
judge
the
counsel
Gandalf
until
all
over
lord
said
Aragorn
The
end
will
not
long
said
the
king
But
will
not
end
here
taken
like
old
badger
trap
Snowmane
and
Hasufel
and
the
horses
guard
are
the
inner
court
When
dawn
comes
will
bid
men
sound
Helm
horn
and
will
ride
forth
Will
you
ride
with
then
son
Arathorn
Maybe
shall
cleave
road
make
such
end
will
worth
song
any
left
sing
hereafter
will
ride
with
you
said
Aragorn
Taking
his
leave
returned
the
walls
and
passed
round
all
their
circuit
enheartening
the
men
and
lending
aid
wherever
the
assault
was
hot
Legolas
went
with
him
Blasts
fire
leaped
from
below
shaking
the
stones
Grappling
hooks
were
hurled
and
ladders
raised
Again
and
again
the
Orcs
gained
the
summit
the
outer
wall
and
again
the
defenders
cast
them
down
last
Aragorn
stood
above
the
great
gates
heedless
the
darts
the
enemy
looked
forth
saw
the
eastern
sky
grow
pale
Then
raised
his
empty
hand
palm
outward
token
parley
The
Orcs
yelled
and
jeered
Come
down
Come
down
they
cried
you
wish
speak
come
down
Bring
out
your
king
are
the
fighting
Uruk
hai
will
fetch
him
from
his
hole
does
not
come
Bring
out
your
skulking
king
The
king
stays
comes
his
own
will
said
Aragorn
Then
what
are
you
doing
here
they
answered
Why
you
look
out
you
wish
see
the
greatness
our
army
are
the
fighting
Uruk
hai
looked
out
see
the
dawn
said
Aragorn
What
the
dawn
they
jeered
are
the
Uruk
hai
not
stop
the
fight
for
night
day
for
fair
weather
for
storm
come
kill
sun
moon
What
the
dawn
None
knows
what
the
new
day
shall
bring
him
said
Aragorn
Get
you
gone
ere
turn
your
evil
Get
down
will
shoot
you
from
the
wall
they
cried
This
parley
You
have
nothing
say
have
still
this
say
answered
Aragorn
enemy
has
yet
taken
the
Hornburg
Depart
not
one
you
will
spared
Not
one
will
left
alive
take
back
tidings
the
North
You
not
know
your
peril
great
power
and
royalty
was
revealed
Aragorn
stood
there
alone
above
the
ruined
gates
before
the
host
his
enemies
that
many
the
wild
men
paused
and
looked
back
over
their
shoulders
the
valley
and
some
looked
doubtfully
the
sky
But
the
Orcs
laughed
with
loud
voices
and
hail
darts
and
arrows
whistled
over
the
wall
Aragorn
leaped
down
There
was
roar
and
blast
fire
The
archway
the
gate
above
which
had
stood
moment
before
crumbled
and
crashed
smoke
and
dust
The
barricade
was
scattered
thunderbolt
Aragorn
ran
the
king
tower
But
even
the
gate
fell
and
the
Orcs
about
yelled
preparing
charge
murmur
arose
behind
them
like
wind
the
distance
and
grew
clamour
many
voices
crying
strange
news
the
dawn
The
Orcs
upon
the
Rock
hearing
the
rumour
dismay
wavered
and
looked
back
And
then
sudden
and
terrible
from
the
tower
above
the
sound
the
great
horn
Helm
rang
out
All
that
heard
that
sound
trembled
Many
the
Orcs
cast
themselves
their
faces
and
covered
their
ears
with
their
claws
Back
from
the
Deep
the
echoes
came
blast
upon
blast
every
cliff
and
hill
mighty
herald
stood
But
the
walls
men
looked
listening
with
wonder
for
the
echoes
did
not
die
Ever
the
horn
blasts
wound
among
the
hills
nearer
now
and
louder
they
answered
one
another
blowing
fierce
and
free
Helm
Helm
the
Riders
shouted
Helm
arisen
and
comes
back
war
Helm
for
Théoden
King
And
with
that
shout
the
king
came
His
horse
was
white
snow
golden
was
his
shield
and
his
spear
was
long
his
right
hand
was
Aragorn
Elendil
heir
behind
him
rode
the
lords
the
House
Eorl
the
Young
Light
sprang
the
sky
Night
departed
Forth
Eorlingas
With
cry
and
great
noise
they
charged
Down
from
the
gates
they
roared
over
the
causeway
they
swept
and
they
drove
through
the
hosts
Isengard
wind
among
grass
Behind
them
from
the
Deep
came
the
stern
cries
men
issuing
from
the
caves
driving
forth
the
enemy
Out
poured
all
the
men
that
were
left
upon
the
Rock
And
ever
the
sound
blowing
horns
echoed
the
hills
they
rode
the
king
and
his
companions
Captains
and
champions
fell
fled
before
them
Neither
orc
nor
man
withstood
them
Their
backs
were
the
swords
and
spears
the
Riders
and
their
faces
the
valley
They
cried
and
wailed
for
fear
and
great
wonder
had
come
upon
them
with
the
rising
the
day
King
Théoden
rode
from
Helm
Gate
and
clove
his
path
the
great
Dike
There
the
company
halted
Light
grew
bright
about
them
Shafts
the
sun
flared
above
the
eastern
hills
and
glimmered
their
spears
But
they
sat
silent
their
horses
and
they
gazed
down
upon
the
Deeping
coomb
The
land
had
changed
Where
before
the
green
dale
had
lain
its
grassy
slopes
lapping
the
ever
mounting
hills
there
now
forest
loomed
Great
trees
bare
and
silent
stood
rank
rank
with
tangled
bough
and
hoary
head
their
twisted
roots
were
buried
the
long
green
grass
Darkness
was
under
them
Between
the
Dike
and
the
eaves
that
nameless
wood
only
two
open
furlongs
lay
There
now
cowered
the
proud
hosts
Saruman
terror
the
king
and
terror
the
trees
They
streamed
down
from
Helm
Gate
until
all
above
the
Dike
was
empty
them
but
below
they
were
packed
like
swarming
flies
Vainly
they
crawled
and
clambered
about
the
walls
the
coomb
seeking
escape
Upon
the
east
too
sheer
and
stony
was
the
valley
side
upon
the
left
from
the
west
their
final
doom
approached
There
suddenly
upon
ridge
appeared
rider
clad
white
shining
the
rising
sun
Over
the
low
hills
the
horns
were
sounding
Behind
him
hastening
down
the
long
slopes
were
thousand
men
foot
their
swords
were
their
hands
Amid
them
strode
man
tall
and
strong
His
shield
was
red
came
the
valley
brink
set
his
lips
great
black
horn
and
blew
ringing
blast
Erkenbrand
the
Riders
shouted
Erkenbrand
Behold
the
White
Rider
cried
Aragorn
Gandalf
come
again
Mithrandir
Mithrandir
said
Legolas
This
wizardry
indeed
Come
would
look
this
forest
ere
the
spell
changes
The
hosts
Isengard
roared
swaying
this
way
and
that
turning
from
fear
fear
Again
the
horn
sounded
from
the
tower
Down
through
the
breach
the
Dike
charged
the
king
company
Down
from
the
hills
leaped
Erkenbrand
lord
Westfold
Down
leaped
Shadowfax
like
deer
that
runs
surefooted
the
mountains
The
White
Rider
was
upon
them
and
the
terror
his
coming
filled
the
enemy
with
madness
The
wild
men
fell
their
faces
before
him
The
Orcs
reeled
and
screamed
and
cast
aside
both
sword
and
spear
Like
black
smoke
driven
mounting
wind
they
fled
Wailing
they
passed
under
the
waiting
shadow
the
trees
and
from
that
shadow
none
ever
came
again
_Chapter
The
Road
Isengard
was
that
the
light
fair
morning
King
Théoden
and
Gandalf
the
White
Rider
met
again
upon
the
green
grass
beside
the
Deeping
stream
There
was
also
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
and
Legolas
the
Elf
and
Erkenbrand
Westfold
and
the
lords
the
Golden
House
About
them
were
gathered
the
Rohirrim
the
Riders
the
Mark
wonder
overcame
their
joy
victory
and
their
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
wood
Suddenly
there
was
great
shout
and
down
from
the
Dike
came
those
who
had
been
driven
back
into
the
Deep
There
came
Gamling
the
Old
and
Éomer
son
Éomund
and
beside
them
walked
Gimli
the
dwarf
had
helm
and
about
his
head
was
linen
band
stained
with
blood
but
his
voice
was
loud
and
strong
Forty
two
Master
Legolas
cried
Alas
axe
notched
the
forty
second
had
iron
collar
his
neck
How
with
you
You
have
passed
score
one
answered
Legolas
But
not
grudge
you
the
game
glad
see
you
your
legs
Welcome
Éomer
sister
son
said
Théoden
Now
that
see
you
safe
glad
indeed
Hail
Lord
the
Mark
said
Éomer
The
dark
night
has
passed
and
day
has
come
again
But
the
day
has
brought
strange
tidings
turned
and
gazed
wonder
first
the
wood
and
then
Gandalf
Once
more
you
come
the
hour
need
unlooked
for
said
Unlooked
for
said
Gandalf
said
that
would
return
and
meet
you
here
But
you
did
not
name
the
hour
nor
foretell
the
manner
your
coming
Strange
help
you
bring
You
are
mighty
wizardry
Gandalf
the
White
That
may
But
have
not
shown
yet
have
but
given
good
counsel
peril
and
made
use
the
speed
Shadowfax
Your
own
valour
has
done
more
and
the
stout
legs
the
Westfold
men
marching
through
the
night
Then
they
all
gazed
Gandalf
with
still
greater
wonder
Some
glanced
darkly
the
wood
and
passed
their
hands
over
their
brows
they
thought
their
eyes
saw
otherwise
than
his
Gandalf
laughed
long
and
merrily
The
trees
said
Nay
see
the
wood
plainly
you
But
that
deed
mine
thing
beyond
the
counsel
the
wise
Better
than
design
and
better
even
than
hope
the
event
has
proved
Then
not
yours
whose
the
wizardry
said
Théoden
Not
Saruman
that
plain
there
some
mightier
sage
whom
have
yet
learn
not
wizardry
but
power
far
older
said
Gandalf
power
that
walked
the
earth
ere
elf
sang
hammer
rang
Ere
iron
was
found
tree
was
hewn
When
young
was
mountain
under
moon
Ere
ring
was
made
wrought
was
woe
walked
the
forests
long
ago
And
what
may
the
answer
your
riddle
said
Théoden
you
would
learn
that
you
should
come
with
Isengard
answered
Gandalf
Isengard
they
cried
Yes
said
Gandalf
shall
return
Isengard
and
those
who
will
may
come
with
There
may
see
strange
things
But
there
are
not
men
enough
the
Mark
not
they
were
all
gathered
together
and
healed
wounds
and
weariness
assault
the
stronghold
Saruman
said
Théoden
Nevertheless
Isengard
said
Gandalf
shall
not
stay
there
long
way
lies
now
eastward
Look
for
Edoras
ere
the
waning
the
moon
Nay
said
Théoden
the
dark
hour
before
dawn
doubted
but
will
not
part
now
will
come
with
you
that
your
counsel
wish
speak
with
Saruman
soon
may
now
said
Gandalf
and
since
has
done
you
great
injury
would
fitting
you
were
there
But
how
soon
and
how
swiftly
will
you
ride
men
are
weary
with
battle
said
the
King
and
weary
also
For
have
ridden
far
and
slept
little
Alas
old
age
not
feigned
nor
due
only
the
whisperings
Wormtongue
ill
that
leech
can
wholly
cure
not
even
Gandalf
Then
let
all
who
are
ride
with
rest
now
said
Gandalf
will
journey
under
the
shadow
evening
well
for
counsel
that
all
our
comings
and
goings
should
secret
may
henceforth
But
not
command
many
men
with
you
Théoden
parley
not
fight
The
King
then
chose
men
that
were
unhurt
and
had
swift
horses
and
sent
them
forth
with
tidings
the
victory
into
every
vale
the
Mark
and
they
bore
his
summons
also
bidding
all
men
young
and
old
come
haste
Edoras
There
the
Lord
the
Mark
would
hold
assembly
all
that
could
bear
arms
the
second
day
after
the
full
moon
ride
with
him
Isengard
the
King
chose
Éomer
and
twenty
men
his
household
With
Gandalf
would
Aragorn
and
Legolas
and
Gimli
spite
his
hurt
the
dwarf
would
not
stay
behind
was
only
feeble
blow
and
the
cap
turned
said
would
take
more
than
such
orc
scratch
keep
back
will
tend
while
you
rest
said
Aragorn
The
king
now
returned
the
Hornburg
and
slept
such
sleep
quiet
had
not
known
for
many
years
and
the
remainder
his
chosen
company
rested
also
But
the
others
all
that
were
not
hurt
wounded
began
great
labour
for
many
had
fallen
the
battle
and
lay
dead
upon
the
field
the
Deep
Orcs
remained
alive
their
bodies
were
uncounted
But
great
many
the
hillmen
had
given
themselves
and
they
were
afraid
and
cried
for
mercy
The
Men
the
Mark
took
their
weapons
from
them
and
set
them
work
Help
now
repair
the
evil
which
you
have
joined
said
Erkenbrand
and
afterwards
you
shall
take
oath
never
again
pass
the
Fords
Isen
arms
nor
march
with
the
enemies
Men
and
then
you
shall
free
back
your
land
For
you
have
been
deluded
Saruman
Many
you
have
got
death
the
reward
your
trust
him
but
had
you
conquered
little
better
would
your
wages
have
been
The
men
Dunland
were
amazed
for
Saruman
had
told
them
that
the
men
Rohan
were
cruel
and
burned
their
captives
alive
the
midst
the
field
before
the
Hornburg
two
mounds
were
raised
and
beneath
them
were
laid
all
the
Riders
the
Mark
who
fell
the
defence
those
the
East
Dales
upon
one
side
and
those
Westfold
upon
the
other
grave
alone
under
the
shadow
the
Hornburg
lay
Háma
captain
the
King
guard
fell
before
the
Gate
The
Orcs
were
piled
great
heaps
away
from
the
mounds
Men
not
far
from
the
eaves
the
forest
And
the
people
were
troubled
their
minds
for
the
heaps
carrion
were
too
great
for
burial
for
burning
They
had
little
wood
for
firing
and
none
would
have
dared
take
axe
the
strange
trees
even
Gandalf
had
not
warned
them
hurt
neither
bark
nor
bough
their
great
peril
Let
the
Orcs
lie
said
Gandalf
The
morning
may
bring
new
counsel
the
afternoon
the
King
company
prepared
depart
The
work
burial
was
then
but
beginning
and
Théoden
mourned
for
the
loss
Háma
his
captain
and
cast
the
first
earth
upon
his
grave
Great
injury
indeed
has
Saruman
done
and
all
this
land
said
and
will
remember
when
meet
The
sun
was
already
drawing
near
the
hills
upon
the
west
the
Coomb
when
last
Théoden
and
Gandalf
and
their
companions
rode
down
from
the
Dike
Behind
them
were
gathered
great
host
both
the
Riders
and
the
people
Westfold
old
and
young
women
and
children
who
had
come
out
from
the
caves
song
victory
they
sang
with
clear
voices
and
then
they
fell
silent
wondering
what
would
chance
for
their
eyes
were
the
trees
and
they
feared
them
The
Riders
came
the
wood
and
they
halted
horse
and
man
they
were
unwilling
pass
The
trees
were
grey
and
menacing
and
shadow
mist
was
about
them
The
ends
their
long
sweeping
boughs
hung
down
like
searching
fingers
their
roots
stood
from
the
ground
like
the
limbs
strange
monsters
and
dark
caverns
opened
beneath
them
But
Gandalf
went
forward
leading
the
company
and
where
the
road
from
the
Hornburg
met
the
trees
they
saw
now
opening
like
arched
gate
under
mighty
boughs
and
through
Gandalf
passed
and
they
followed
him
Then
their
amazement
they
found
that
the
road
ran
and
the
Deeping
stream
beside
and
the
sky
was
open
above
and
full
golden
light
But
either
side
the
great
aisles
the
wood
were
already
wrapped
dusk
stretching
away
into
impenetrable
shadows
and
there
they
heard
the
creaking
and
groaning
boughs
and
far
cries
and
rumour
wordless
voices
murmuring
angrily
Orc
other
living
creature
could
seen
Legolas
and
Gimli
were
now
riding
together
upon
one
horse
and
they
kept
close
beside
Gandalf
for
Gimli
was
afraid
the
wood
hot
here
said
Legolas
Gandalf
feel
great
wrath
about
you
not
feel
the
air
throb
your
ears
Yes
said
Gandalf
What
has
become
the
miserable
Orcs
said
Legolas
That
think
one
will
ever
know
said
Gandalf
They
rode
silence
for
while
but
Legolas
was
ever
glancing
from
side
side
and
would
often
have
halted
listen
the
sounds
the
wood
Gimli
had
allowed
These
are
the
strangest
trees
that
ever
saw
said
and
have
seen
many
oak
grow
from
acorn
ruinous
age
wish
that
there
were
leisure
now
walk
among
them
they
have
voices
and
time
might
come
understand
their
thought
said
Gimli
Let
leave
them
guess
their
thought
already
hatred
all
that
two
legs
and
their
speech
crushing
and
strangling
Not
all
that
two
legs
said
Legolas
There
think
you
are
wrong
Orcs
that
they
hate
For
they
not
belong
here
and
know
little
Elves
and
Men
Far
away
are
the
valleys
where
they
sprang
From
the
deep
dales
Fangorn
Gimli
that
whence
they
come
guess
Then
that
the
most
perilous
wood
Middle
earth
said
Gimli
should
grateful
for
the
part
they
have
played
but
not
love
them
You
may
think
them
wonderful
but
have
seen
greater
wonder
this
land
more
beautiful
than
any
grove
glade
that
ever
grew
heart
still
full
Strange
are
the
ways
Men
Legolas
Here
they
have
one
the
marvels
the
Northern
World
and
what
they
say
Caves
they
say
Caves
Holes
fly
time
war
store
fodder
good
Legolas
you
know
that
the
caverns
Helm
Deep
are
vast
and
beautiful
There
would
endless
pilgrimage
Dwarves
merely
gaze
them
such
things
were
known
Aye
indeed
they
would
pay
pure
gold
for
brief
glance
And
would
give
gold
excused
said
Legolas
and
double
let
out
strayed
You
have
not
seen
forgive
your
jest
said
Gimli
But
you
speak
like
fool
you
think
those
halls
are
fair
where
your
King
dwells
under
the
hill
Mirkwood
and
Dwarves
helped
their
making
long
ago
They
are
but
hovels
compared
with
the
caverns
have
seen
here
immeasurable
halls
filled
with
everlasting
music
water
that
tinkles
into
pools
fair
Kheled
zâram
the
starlight
And
Legolas
when
the
torches
are
kindled
and
men
walk
the
sandy
floors
under
the
echoing
domes
then
Legolas
gems
and
crystals
and
veins
precious
ore
glint
the
polished
walls
and
the
light
glows
through
folded
marbles
shell
like
translucent
the
living
hands
Queen
Galadriel
There
are
columns
white
and
saffron
and
dawn
rose
Legolas
fluted
and
twisted
into
dreamlike
forms
they
spring
from
many
coloured
floors
meet
the
glistening
pendants
the
roof
wings
ropes
curtains
fine
frozen
clouds
spears
banners
pinnacles
suspended
palaces
Still
lakes
mirror
them
glimmering
world
looks
from
dark
pools
covered
with
clear
glass
cities
such
the
mind
Durin
could
scarce
have
imagined
his
sleep
stretch
through
avenues
and
pillared
courts
into
the
dark
recesses
where
light
can
come
And
plink
silver
drop
falls
and
the
round
wrinkles
the
glass
make
all
the
towers
bend
and
waver
like
weeds
and
corals
grotto
the
sea
Then
evening
comes
they
fade
and
twinkle
out
the
torches
pass
into
another
chamber
and
another
dream
There
chamber
after
chamber
Legolas
hall
opening
out
hall
dome
after
dome
stair
beyond
stair
and
still
the
winding
paths
lead
into
the
mountains
heart
Caves
The
Caverns
Helm
Deep
Happy
was
the
chance
that
drove
there
makes
weep
leave
them
Then
will
wish
you
this
fortune
for
your
comfort
Gimli
said
the
Elf
that
you
may
come
safe
from
war
and
return
see
them
again
But
not
tell
all
your
kindred
There
seems
little
left
for
them
from
your
account
Maybe
the
men
this
land
are
wise
say
little
one
family
busy
dwarves
with
hammer
and
chisel
might
mar
more
than
they
made
you
not
understand
said
Gimli
dwarf
could
unmoved
such
loveliness
None
Durin
race
would
mine
those
caves
for
stones
ore
not
diamonds
and
gold
could
got
there
you
cut
down
groves
blossoming
trees
the
spring
time
for
firewood
would
tend
these
glades
flowering
stone
not
quarry
them
With
cautious
skill
tap
tap
small
chip
rock
and
more
perhaps
whole
anxious
day
could
work
and
the
years
went
should
open
new
ways
and
display
far
chambers
that
are
still
dark
glimpsed
only
void
beyond
fissures
the
rock
And
lights
Legolas
should
make
lights
such
lamps
once
shone
Khazad
dûm
and
when
wished
would
drive
away
the
night
that
has
lain
there
since
the
hills
were
made
and
when
desired
rest
would
let
the
night
return
You
move
Gimli
said
Legolas
have
never
heard
you
speak
like
this
before
Almost
you
make
regret
that
have
not
seen
these
caves
Come
Let
make
this
bargain
both
return
safe
out
the
perils
that
await
will
journey
for
while
together
You
shall
visit
Fangorn
with
and
then
will
come
with
you
see
Helm
Deep
That
would
not
the
way
return
that
should
choose
said
Gimli
But
will
endure
Fangorn
have
your
promise
come
back
the
caves
and
share
their
wonder
with
You
have
promise
said
Legolas
But
alas
Now
must
leave
behind
both
cave
and
wood
for
while
See
are
coming
the
end
the
trees
How
far
Isengard
Gandalf
About
fifteen
leagues
the
crows
Saruman
make
said
Gandalf
five
from
the
mouth
Deeping
coomb
the
Fords
and
ten
more
from
there
the
gates
Isengard
But
shall
not
ride
all
the
way
this
night
And
when
come
there
what
shall
see
asked
Gimli
You
may
know
but
cannot
guess
not
know
myself
for
certain
answered
the
wizard
was
there
nightfall
yesterday
but
much
may
have
happened
since
Yet
think
that
you
will
not
say
that
the
journey
was
vain
not
though
the
Glittering
Caves
Aglarond
left
behind
last
the
company
passed
through
the
trees
and
found
that
they
had
come
the
bottom
the
Coomb
where
the
road
from
Helm
Deep
branched
going
one
way
east
Edoras
and
the
other
north
the
Fords
Isen
they
rode
from
under
the
eaves
the
wood
Legolas
halted
and
looked
back
with
regret
Then
gave
sudden
cry
There
are
eyes
said
Eyes
looking
out
from
the
shadows
the
boughs
never
saw
such
eyes
before
The
others
surprised
his
cry
halted
and
turned
but
Legolas
started
ride
back
cried
Gimli
you
please
your
madness
but
let
first
get
down
from
this
horse
wish
see
eyes
Stay
Legolas
Greenleaf
said
Gandalf
not
back
into
the
wood
not
yet
Now
not
your
time
Even
spoke
there
came
forward
out
the
trees
three
strange
shapes
tall
trolls
they
were
twelve
feet
more
height
their
strong
bodies
stout
young
trees
seemed
clad
with
raiment
with
hide
close
fitting
grey
and
brown
Their
limbs
were
long
and
their
hands
had
many
fingers
their
hair
was
stiff
and
their
beards
grey
green
moss
They
gazed
out
with
solemn
eyes
but
they
were
not
looking
the
riders
their
eyes
were
bent
northwards
Suddenly
they
lifted
their
long
hands
their
mouths
and
sent
forth
ringing
calls
clear
notes
horn
but
more
musical
and
various
The
calls
were
answered
and
turning
again
the
riders
saw
other
creatures
the
same
kind
approaching
striding
through
the
grass
They
came
swiftly
from
the
North
walking
like
wading
herons
their
gait
but
not
their
speed
for
their
legs
their
long
paces
beat
quicker
than
the
heron
wings
The
riders
cried
aloud
wonder
and
some
set
their
hands
upon
their
sword
hilts
You
need
weapons
said
Gandalf
These
are
but
herdsmen
They
are
not
enemies
indeed
they
are
not
concerned
with
all
seemed
for
spoke
the
tall
creatures
without
glance
the
riders
strode
into
the
wood
and
vanished
Herdsmen
said
Théoden
Where
are
their
flocks
What
are
they
Gandalf
For
plain
that
you
any
rate
they
are
not
strange
They
are
the
shepherds
the
trees
answered
Gandalf
long
since
you
listened
tales
the
fireside
There
are
children
your
land
who
out
the
twisted
threads
story
could
pick
the
answer
your
question
You
have
seen
Ents
King
Ents
out
Fangorn
Forest
which
your
tongue
you
call
the
Entwood
Did
you
think
that
the
name
was
given
only
idle
fancy
Nay
Théoden
otherwise
them
you
are
but
the
passing
tale
all
the
years
from
Eorl
the
Young
Théoden
the
Old
are
little
count
them
and
all
the
deeds
your
house
but
small
matter
The
king
was
silent
Ents
said
length
Out
the
shadows
legend
begin
little
understand
the
marvel
the
trees
think
have
lived
see
strange
days
Long
have
tended
our
beasts
and
our
fields
built
our
houses
wrought
our
tools
ridden
away
help
the
wars
Minas
Tirith
And
that
called
the
life
Men
the
way
the
world
cared
little
for
what
lay
beyond
the
borders
our
land
Songs
have
that
tell
these
things
but
are
forgetting
them
teaching
them
only
children
careless
custom
And
now
the
songs
have
come
down
among
out
strange
places
and
walk
visible
under
the
Sun
You
should
glad
Théoden
King
said
Gandalf
For
not
only
the
little
life
Men
now
endangered
but
the
life
also
those
things
which
you
have
deemed
the
matter
legend
You
are
not
without
allies
even
you
know
them
not
Yet
also
should
sad
said
Théoden
For
however
the
fortune
war
shall
may
not
end
that
much
that
was
fair
and
wonderful
shall
pass
for
ever
out
Middle
earth
may
said
Gandalf
The
evil
Sauron
cannot
wholly
cured
nor
made
had
not
been
But
such
days
are
doomed
Let
now
with
the
journey
have
begun
The
company
turned
then
away
from
the
Coomb
and
from
the
wood
and
took
the
road
towards
the
Fords
Legolas
followed
reluctantly
The
sun
had
set
already
had
sunk
behind
the
rim
the
world
but
they
rode
out
from
the
shadow
the
hills
and
looked
west
the
Gap
Rohan
the
sky
was
still
red
and
burning
light
was
under
the
floating
clouds
Dark
against
there
wheeled
and
flew
many
black
winged
birds
Some
passed
overhead
with
mournful
cries
returning
their
homes
among
the
rocks
The
carrion
fowl
have
been
busy
about
the
battle
field
said
Éomer
They
rode
now
easy
pace
and
dark
came
down
upon
the
plains
about
them
The
slow
moon
mounted
now
waxing
towards
the
full
and
its
cold
silver
light
the
swelling
grass
lands
rose
and
fell
like
wide
grey
sea
They
had
ridden
for
some
four
hours
from
the
branching
the
roads
when
they
drew
near
the
Fords
Long
slopes
ran
swiftly
down
where
the
river
spread
stony
shoals
between
high
grassy
terraces
Borne
upon
the
wind
they
heard
the
howling
wolves
Their
hearts
were
heavy
remembering
the
many
men
that
had
fallen
battle
this
place
The
road
dipped
between
rising
turf
banks
carving
its
way
through
the
terraces
the
river
edge
and
again
upon
the
further
side
There
were
three
lines
flat
stepping
stones
across
the
stream
and
between
them
fords
for
horses
that
went
from
either
brink
bare
eyot
the
midst
The
riders
looked
down
upon
the
crossings
and
seemed
strange
them
for
the
Fords
had
ever
been
place
full
the
rush
and
chatter
water
upon
stones
but
now
they
were
silent
The
beds
the
stream
were
almost
dry
bare
waste
shingles
and
grey
sand
This
become
dreary
place
said
Éomer
What
sickness
has
befallen
the
river
Many
fair
things
Saruman
has
destroyed
has
devoured
the
springs
Isen
too
would
seem
said
Gandalf
Alas
said
Théoden
Must
pass
this
way
where
the
carrion
beasts
devour
many
good
Riders
the
Mark
This
our
way
said
Gandalf
Grievous
the
fall
your
men
but
you
shall
see
that
least
the
wolves
the
mountains
not
devour
them
with
their
friends
the
Orcs
that
they
hold
their
feast
such
indeed
the
friendship
their
kind
Come
They
rode
down
the
river
and
they
came
the
wolves
ceased
their
howling
and
slunk
away
Fear
fell
them
seeing
Gandalf
the
moon
and
Shadowfax
his
horse
shining
like
silver
The
riders
passed
over
the
islet
and
glittering
eyes
watched
them
wanly
from
the
shadows
the
banks
Look
said
Gandalf
Friends
have
laboured
here
And
they
saw
that
the
midst
the
eyot
mound
was
piled
ringed
with
stones
and
set
about
with
many
spears
Here
lie
all
the
Men
the
Mark
that
fell
near
this
place
said
Gandalf
Here
let
them
rest
said
Éomer
And
when
their
spears
have
rotted
and
rusted
long
still
may
their
mound
stand
and
guard
the
Fords
Isen
this
your
work
also
Gandalf
friend
said
Théoden
You
accomplished
much
evening
and
night
With
the
help
Shadowfax
and
others
said
Gandalf
rode
fast
and
far
But
here
beside
the
mound
will
say
this
for
your
comfort
many
fell
the
battles
the
Fords
but
fewer
than
rumour
made
them
More
were
scattered
than
were
slain
gathered
together
all
that
could
find
Some
men
sent
with
Grimbold
Westfold
join
Erkenbrand
Some
set
make
this
burial
They
have
now
followed
your
marshal
Elfhelm
sent
him
with
many
Riders
Edoras
Saruman
knew
had
despatched
his
full
strength
against
you
and
his
servants
had
turned
aside
from
all
other
errands
and
gone
Helm
Deep
the
lands
seemed
empty
enemies
yet
feared
that
wolf
riders
and
plunderers
might
ride
nonetheless
Meduseld
while
was
undefended
But
now
think
you
need
not
fear
you
will
find
your
house
welcome
your
return
And
glad
shall
see
again
said
Théoden
though
brief
now
doubt
not
shall
abiding
there
With
that
the
company
said
farewell
the
island
and
the
mound
and
passed
over
the
river
and
climbed
the
further
bank
Then
they
rode
glad
have
left
the
mournful
Fords
they
went
the
howling
the
wolves
broke
out
anew
There
was
ancient
highway
that
ran
down
from
Isengard
the
crossings
For
some
way
took
its
course
beside
the
river
bending
with
east
and
then
north
but
the
last
turned
away
and
went
straight
towards
the
gates
Isengard
and
these
were
under
the
mountain
side
the
west
the
valley
sixteen
miles
more
from
its
mouth
This
road
they
followed
but
they
did
not
ride
upon
for
the
ground
beside
was
firm
and
level
covered
for
many
miles
about
with
short
springing
turf
They
rode
now
more
swiftly
and
midnight
the
Fords
were
nearly
five
leagues
behind
Then
they
halted
ending
their
night
journey
for
the
King
was
weary
They
were
come
the
feet
the
Misty
Mountains
and
the
long
arms
Nan
Curunír
stretched
down
meet
them
Dark
lay
the
vale
before
them
for
the
moon
had
passed
into
the
West
and
its
light
was
hidden
the
hills
But
out
the
deep
shadow
the
dale
rose
vast
spire
smoke
and
vapour
mounted
caught
the
rays
the
sinking
moon
and
spread
shimmering
billows
black
and
silver
over
the
starry
sky
What
you
think
that
Gandalf
asked
Aragorn
One
would
say
that
all
the
Wizard
Vale
was
burning
There
ever
fume
above
that
valley
these
days
said
Éomer
but
have
never
seen
aught
like
this
before
These
are
steams
rather
than
smokes
Saruman
brewing
some
devilry
greet
Maybe
boiling
all
the
waters
Isen
and
that
why
the
river
runs
dry
Maybe
said
Gandalf
Tomorrow
shall
learn
what
doing
Now
let
rest
for
while
can
They
camped
beside
the
bed
the
Isen
river
was
still
silent
and
empty
Some
them
slept
little
But
late
the
night
the
watchmen
cried
out
and
all
awoke
The
moon
was
gone
Stars
were
shining
above
but
over
the
ground
there
crept
darkness
blacker
than
the
night
both
sides
the
river
rolled
towards
them
going
northward
Stay
where
you
are
said
Gandalf
Draw
weapons
Wait
and
will
pass
you
mist
gathered
about
them
Above
them
few
stars
still
glimmered
faintly
but
either
side
there
arose
walls
impenetrable
gloom
they
were
narrow
lane
between
moving
towers
shadow
Voices
they
heard
whisperings
and
groanings
and
endless
rustling
sigh
the
earth
shook
under
them
Long
seemed
them
that
they
sat
and
were
afraid
but
last
the
darkness
and
the
rumour
passed
and
vanished
between
the
mountain
arms
Away
south
upon
the
Hornburg
the
middle
night
men
heard
great
noise
wind
the
valley
and
the
ground
trembled
and
all
were
afraid
and
one
ventured
forth
But
the
morning
they
went
out
and
were
amazed
for
the
slain
Orcs
were
gone
and
the
trees
also
Far
down
into
the
valley
the
Deep
the
grass
was
crushed
and
trampled
brown
giant
herdsmen
had
pastured
great
droves
cattle
there
but
mile
below
the
Dike
huge
pit
had
been
delved
the
earth
and
over
stones
were
piled
into
hill
Men
believed
that
the
Orcs
whom
they
had
slain
were
buried
there
but
whether
those
who
had
fled
into
the
wood
were
with
them
none
could
say
for
man
ever
set
foot
upon
that
hill
The
Death
Down
was
afterwards
called
and
grass
would
grow
there
But
the
strange
trees
were
never
seen
Deeping
coomb
again
they
had
returned
night
and
had
gone
far
away
the
dark
dales
Fangorn
Thus
they
were
revenged
upon
the
Orcs
The
king
and
his
company
slept
more
that
night
but
they
saw
and
heard
other
strange
thing
save
one
the
voice
the
river
beside
them
suddenly
awoke
There
was
rush
water
hurrying
down
among
the
stones
and
when
had
passed
the
Isen
flowed
and
bubbled
its
bed
again
had
ever
done
dawn
they
made
ready
The
light
came
grey
and
pale
and
they
did
not
see
the
rising
the
sun
The
air
above
was
heavy
with
fog
and
reek
lay
the
land
about
them
They
went
slowly
riding
now
upon
the
highway
was
broad
and
hard
and
well
tended
Dimly
through
the
mists
they
could
descry
the
long
arm
the
mountains
rising
their
left
They
had
passed
into
Nan
Curunír
the
Wizard
Vale
That
was
sheltered
valley
open
only
the
South
Once
had
been
fair
and
green
and
through
the
Isen
flowed
already
deep
and
strong
before
found
the
plains
for
was
fed
many
springs
and
lesser
streams
among
the
rain
washed
hills
and
all
about
there
had
lain
pleasant
fertile
land
was
not
now
Beneath
the
walls
Isengard
there
still
were
acres
tilled
the
slaves
Saruman
but
most
the
valley
had
become
wilderness
weeds
and
thorns
Brambles
trailed
upon
the
ground
clambering
over
bush
and
bank
made
shaggy
caves
where
small
beasts
housed
trees
grew
there
but
among
the
rank
grasses
could
still
seen
the
burned
and
axe
hewn
stumps
ancient
groves
was
sad
country
silent
now
but
for
the
stony
noise
quick
waters
Smokes
and
steams
drifted
sullen
clouds
and
lurked
the
hollows
The
riders
did
not
speak
Many
doubted
their
hearts
wondering
what
dismal
end
their
journey
led
After
they
had
ridden
for
some
miles
the
highway
became
wide
street
paved
with
great
flat
stones
squared
and
laid
with
skill
blade
grass
was
seen
any
joint
Deep
gutters
filled
with
trickling
water
ran
down
either
side
Suddenly
tall
pillar
loomed
before
them
was
black
and
set
upon
was
great
stone
carved
and
painted
the
likeness
long
White
Hand
Its
finger
pointed
north
Not
far
now
they
knew
that
the
gates
Isengard
must
stand
and
their
hearts
were
heavy
but
their
eyes
could
not
pierce
the
mists
ahead
Beneath
the
mountain
arm
within
the
Wizard
Vale
through
years
uncounted
had
stood
that
ancient
place
that
Men
called
Isengard
Partly
was
shaped
the
making
the
mountains
but
mighty
works
the
Men
Westernesse
had
wrought
there
old
and
Saruman
had
dwelt
there
long
and
had
not
been
idle
This
was
its
fashion
while
Saruman
was
his
height
accounted
many
the
chief
Wizards
great
ring
wall
stone
like
towering
cliffs
stood
out
from
the
shelter
the
mountain
side
from
which
ran
and
then
returned
again
One
entrance
only
was
there
made
great
arch
delved
the
southern
wall
Here
through
the
black
rock
long
tunnel
had
been
hewn
closed
either
end
with
mighty
doors
iron
They
were
wrought
and
poised
upon
their
huge
hinges
posts
steel
driven
into
the
living
stone
that
when
unbarred
they
could
moved
with
light
thrust
the
arms
noiselessly
One
who
passed
and
came
length
out
the
echoing
tunnel
beheld
plain
great
circle
somewhat
hollowed
like
vast
shallow
bowl
mile
measured
from
rim
rim
Once
had
been
green
and
filled
with
avenues
and
groves
fruitful
trees
watered
streams
that
flowed
from
the
mountains
lake
But
green
thing
grew
there
the
latter
days
Saruman
The
roads
were
paved
with
stone
flags
dark
and
hard
and
beside
their
borders
instead
trees
there
marched
long
lines
pillars
some
marble
some
copper
and
iron
joined
heavy
chains
Many
houses
there
were
chambers
halls
and
passages
cut
and
tunnelled
back
into
the
walls
upon
their
inner
side
that
all
the
open
circle
was
overlooked
countless
windows
and
dark
doors
Thousands
could
dwell
there
workers
servants
slaves
and
warriors
with
great
store
arms
wolves
were
fed
and
stabled
deep
dens
beneath
The
plain
too
was
bored
and
delved
Shafts
were
driven
deep
into
the
ground
their
upper
ends
were
covered
low
mounds
and
domes
stone
that
the
moonlight
the
Ring
Isengard
looked
like
graveyard
unquiet
dead
For
the
ground
trembled
The
shafts
ran
down
many
slopes
and
spiral
stairs
caverns
far
under
there
Saruman
had
treasuries
store
houses
armouries
smithies
and
great
furnaces
Iron
wheels
revolved
there
endlessly
and
hammers
thudded
night
plumes
vapour
steamed
from
the
vents
lit
from
beneath
with
red
light
blue
venomous
green
the
centre
all
the
roads
ran
between
their
chains
There
stood
tower
marvellous
shape
was
fashioned
the
builders
old
who
smoothed
the
Ring
Isengard
and
yet
seemed
thing
not
made
the
craft
Men
but
riven
from
the
bones
the
earth
the
ancient
torment
the
hills
peak
and
isle
rock
was
black
and
gleaming
hard
four
mighty
piers
many
sided
stone
were
welded
into
one
but
near
the
summit
they
opened
into
gaping
horns
their
pinnacles
sharp
the
points
spears
keen
edged
knives
Between
them
was
narrow
space
and
there
upon
floor
polished
stone
written
with
strange
signs
man
might
stand
five
hundred
feet
above
the
plain
This
was
Orthanc
the
citadel
Saruman
the
name
which
had
design
chance
twofold
meaning
for
the
Elvish
speech
_orthanc_
signifies
Mount
Fang
but
the
language
the
Mark
old
the
Cunning
Mind
strong
place
and
wonderful
was
Isengard
and
long
had
been
beautiful
and
there
great
lords
had
dwelt
the
wardens
Gondor
upon
the
West
and
wise
men
that
watched
the
stars
But
Saruman
had
slowly
shaped
his
shifting
purposes
and
made
better
thought
being
deceived
for
all
those
arts
and
subtle
devices
for
which
forsook
his
former
wisdom
and
which
fondly
imagined
were
his
own
came
but
from
Mordor
that
what
made
was
naught
only
little
copy
child
model
slave
flattery
that
vast
fortress
armoury
prison
furnace
great
power
Barad
dûr
the
Dark
Tower
which
suffered
rival
and
laughed
flattery
biding
its
time
secure
its
pride
and
its
immeasurable
strength
This
was
the
stronghold
Saruman
fame
reported
for
within
living
memory
the
men
Rohan
had
not
passed
its
gates
save
perhaps
few
such
Wormtongue
who
came
secret
and
told
man
what
they
saw
Now
Gandalf
rode
the
great
pillar
the
Hand
and
passed
and
did
the
Riders
saw
their
wonder
that
the
Hand
appeared
longer
white
was
stained
with
dried
blood
and
looking
closer
they
perceived
that
its
nails
were
red
Unheeding
Gandalf
rode
into
the
mist
and
reluctantly
they
followed
him
All
about
them
now
there
had
been
sudden
flood
wide
pools
water
lay
beside
the
road
filling
the
hollows
and
rills
went
trickling
down
among
the
stones
last
Gandalf
halted
and
beckoned
them
and
they
came
and
saw
that
beyond
him
the
mists
had
cleared
and
pale
sunlight
shone
The
hour
noon
had
passed
They
were
come
the
doors
Isengard
But
the
doors
lay
hurled
and
twisted
the
ground
And
all
about
stone
cracked
and
splintered
into
countless
jagged
shards
was
scattered
far
and
wide
piled
ruinous
heaps
The
great
arch
still
stood
but
opened
now
upon
roofless
chasm
the
tunnel
was
laid
bare
and
through
the
cliff
like
walls
either
side
great
rents
and
breaches
had
been
torn
their
towers
were
beaten
into
dust
the
Great
Sea
had
risen
wrath
and
fallen
the
hills
with
storm
could
have
worked
greater
ruin
The
ring
beyond
was
filled
with
steaming
water
bubbling
cauldron
which
there
heaved
and
floated
wreckage
beams
and
spars
chests
and
casks
and
broken
gear
Twisted
and
leaning
pillars
reared
their
splintered
stems
above
the
flood
but
all
the
roads
were
drowned
Far
off
seemed
half
veiled
winding
cloud
there
loomed
the
island
rock
Still
dark
and
tall
unbroken
the
storm
the
tower
Orthanc
stood
Pale
waters
lapped
about
its
feet
The
king
and
all
his
company
sat
silent
their
horses
marvelling
perceiving
that
the
power
Saruman
was
overthrown
but
how
they
could
not
guess
And
now
they
turned
their
eyes
towards
the
archway
and
the
ruined
gates
There
they
saw
close
beside
them
great
rubble
heap
and
suddenly
they
were
aware
two
small
figures
lying
their
ease
grey
clad
hardly
seen
among
the
stones
There
were
bottles
and
bowls
and
platters
laid
beside
them
they
had
just
eaten
well
and
now
rested
from
their
labour
One
seemed
asleep
the
other
with
crossed
legs
and
arms
behind
his
head
leaned
back
against
broken
rock
and
sent
from
his
mouth
long
wisps
and
little
rings
thin
blue
smoke
For
moment
Théoden
and
Éomer
and
all
his
men
stared
them
wonder
Amid
all
the
wreck
Isengard
this
seemed
them
the
strangest
sight
But
before
the
king
could
speak
the
small
smoke
breathing
figure
became
suddenly
aware
them
they
sat
there
silent
the
edge
the
mist
sprang
his
feet
young
man
looked
like
one
though
not
much
more
than
half
man
height
his
head
brown
curling
hair
was
uncovered
but
was
clad
travel
stained
cloak
the
same
hue
and
shape
the
companions
Gandalf
had
worn
when
they
rode
Edoras
bowed
very
low
putting
his
hand
upon
his
breast
Then
seeming
not
observe
the
wizard
and
his
friends
turned
Éomer
and
the
king
Welcome
lords
Isengard
said
are
the
doorwardens
Meriadoc
son
Saradoc
name
and
companion
who
alas
overcome
with
weariness
here
gave
the
other
dig
with
his
foot
Peregrin
son
Paladin
the
house
Took
Far
the
North
our
home
The
Lord
Saruman
within
but
the
moment
closeted
with
one
Wormtongue
doubtless
would
here
welcome
such
honourable
guests
Doubtless
would
laughed
Gandalf
And
was
Saruman
that
ordered
you
guard
his
damaged
doors
and
watch
for
the
arrival
guests
when
your
attention
could
spared
from
plate
and
bottle
good
sir
the
matter
escaped
him
answered
Merry
gravely
has
been
much
occupied
Our
orders
came
from
Treebeard
who
has
taken
over
the
management
Isengard
commanded
welcome
the
Lord
Rohan
with
fitting
words
have
done
best
And
what
about
your
companions
What
about
Legolas
and
cried
Gimli
unable
contain
himself
longer
You
rascals
you
woolly
footed
and
wool
pated
truants
fine
hunt
you
have
led
Two
hundred
leagues
through
fen
and
forest
battle
and
death
rescue
you
And
here
find
you
feasting
and
idling
and
smoking
Smoking
Where
did
you
come
the
weed
you
villains
Hammer
and
tongs
torn
between
rage
and
joy
that
not
burst
will
marvel
You
speak
for
Gimli
laughed
Legolas
Though
would
sooner
learn
how
they
came
the
wine
One
thing
you
have
not
found
your
hunting
and
that
brighter
wits
said
Pippin
opening
eye
Here
you
find
sitting
field
victory
amid
the
plunder
armies
and
you
wonder
how
came
few
well
earned
comforts
Well
earned
said
Gimli
cannot
believe
that
The
Riders
laughed
cannot
doubted
that
witness
the
meeting
dear
friends
said
Théoden
these
are
the
lost
ones
your
company
Gandalf
The
days
are
fated
filled
with
marvels
Already
have
seen
many
since
left
house
and
now
here
before
eyes
stand
yet
another
the
folk
legend
Are
not
these
the
Halflings
that
some
among
call
the
Holbytlan
Hobbits
you
please
lord
said
Pippin
Hobbits
said
Théoden
Your
tongue
strangely
changed
but
the
name
sounds
not
unfitting
Hobbits
report
that
have
heard
does
justice
the
truth
Merry
bowed
and
Pippin
got
and
bowed
low
You
are
gracious
lord
hope
that
may
take
your
words
said
And
here
another
marvel
have
wandered
many
lands
since
left
home
and
never
till
now
have
found
people
that
knew
any
story
concerning
hobbits
people
came
out
the
North
long
ago
said
Théoden
But
will
not
deceive
you
know
tales
about
hobbits
All
that
said
among
that
far
away
over
many
hills
and
rivers
live
the
halfling
folk
that
dwell
holes
sand
dunes
But
there
are
legends
their
deeds
for
said
that
they
little
and
avoid
the
sight
men
being
able
vanish
twinkling
and
they
can
change
their
voices
resemble
the
piping
birds
But
seems
that
more
could
said
could
indeed
lord
said
Merry
For
one
thing
said
Théoden
had
not
heard
that
they
spouted
smoke
from
their
mouths
That
not
surprising
answered
Merry
for
art
which
have
not
practised
for
more
than
few
generations
was
Tobold
Hornblower
Longbottom
the
Southfarthing
who
first
grew
the
true
pipe
weed
his
gardens
about
the
year
1070
according
our
reckoning
How
old
Toby
came
the
plant
You
not
know
your
danger
Théoden
interrupted
Gandalf
These
hobbits
will
sit
the
edge
ruin
and
discuss
the
pleasures
the
table
the
small
doings
their
fathers
grandfathers
and
great
grandfathers
and
remoter
cousins
the
ninth
degree
you
encourage
them
with
undue
patience
Some
other
time
would
more
fitting
for
the
history
smoking
Where
Treebeard
Merry
Away
the
north
side
believe
went
get
drink
clean
water
Most
the
other
Ents
are
with
him
still
busy
their
work
over
there
Merry
waved
his
hand
towards
the
steaming
lake
and
they
looked
they
heard
distant
rumbling
and
rattling
avalanche
was
falling
from
the
mountain
side
Far
away
came
_hoom
hom_
horns
blowing
triumphantly
And
Orthanc
then
left
unguarded
asked
Gandalf
There
the
water
said
Merry
But
Quickbeam
and
some
others
are
watching
Not
all
those
posts
and
pillars
the
plain
are
Saruman
planting
Quickbeam

the
rock
near

Yes

Gandalf

Yet

Did
leave

plate
and
bottle
driven
from
your
mind
left
message
said
Merry
and
was
coming
but
have
been
hindered
many
other
questions
was
say
that
the
Lord
the
Mark
and
Gandalf
will
ride
the
northern
wall
they
will
find
Treebeard
there
and
will
welcome
them
may
add
that
they
will
also
find
food
the
best
there

discovered
and
selected
your
humble
servants
bowed
Gandalf
laughed
That
better
said
Well
Théoden
will
you
ride
with
find
Treebeard
must
round
about
but
not
far
When
you
see
Treebeard
you
will
learn
much
For
Treebeard
Fangorn
and
the
eldest
and
chief
the
Ents
and
when
you
speak
with
him
you
will
hear
the
speech
the
oldest
all
living
things
will
come
with
you
said
Théoden
Farewell
hobbits
May
meet
again
house
There
you
shall
sit
beside
and
tell
all
that
your
hearts
desire
the
deeds
your
grandsires
far
you
can
reckon
them
and
will
speak
also
Tobold
the
Old
and
his

Farewell
The
hobbits
bowed
low

Pippin

Very

come
said
Aragorn
And
now
that
the
great
ones
have
gone
discuss
high
matters
said
Legolas
the
hunters
can
perhaps
learn
the
answers
their
own
small
riddles
tracked
you
far
the
forest
but
there
are
still
many
things
that
should
like
know
the
truth
And
there
great
deal
too
that
want
know
about
you
said
Merry
have
learnt
few
things
through
Treebeard
the
Old
Ent
but
that
not
nearly
enough
All
good
time
said
Legolas
were
the
hunters
and
you
should
give
account
yourselves
first
second
said
Gimli
would
better
after
meal
have
sore
head
and
past
mid
day
You
truants
might
make
amends
finding
some
the
plunder
that
you
spoke
Food
and
drink
would
pay
off
some
score
against
you
Then
you
shall
have
said
Pippin
Will
you
have
here
more
comfort
what
left
Saruman
guard
house
over
there
under
the
arch
had
picnic
out
here
keep
eye
the
road
Less
than
eye
said
Gimli
But
will
not
into
any
orc
house
nor
touch
Orcs
meat
anything
that
they
have
mauled
wouldn
ask
you
said
Merry
have
had
enough
Orcs
ourselves
last
life
time
But
there
were
many
other
folk
Isengard
Saruman
kept
enough
wisdom
not
trust
his
Orcs
had
Men
guard
his
gates
some
his
most
faithful
servants
suppose
Anyway
they
were
favoured
and
got
good
provisions
And
pipe
weed
asked
Gimli
don
think
Merry
laughed
But
that
another
story
which
can
wait
until
after
lunch
Well
let
and
have
lunch
then
said
the
Dwarf
The
hobbits
led
the
way
and
they
passed
under
the
arch
and
came
wide
door
upon
the
left
the
top
stair
opened
direct
into
large
chamber
with
other
smaller
doors
the
far
end
and
hearth
and
chimney
one
side
The
chamber
was
hewn
out
the
stone
and
must
once
have
been
dark
for
its
windows
looked
out
only
into
the
tunnel
But
light
came
now
through
the
broken
roof
the
hearth
wood
was
burning
lit
bit
fire
said
Pippin
cheered
the
fogs
There
were
few
faggots
about
and
most
the
wood
could
find
was
wet
But
there
great
draught
the
chimney
seems
wind
away
through
the
rock
and
fortunately
has
not
been
blocked
fire
handy
will
make
you
some
toast
The
bread
three
four
days
old
afraid
Aragorn
and
his
companions
sat
themselves
down
one
end
long
table
and
the
hobbits
disappeared
through
one
the
inner
doors
Store
room
there
and
above
the
woods
luckily
said
Pippin
they
came
back
laden
with
dishes
bowls
cups
knives
and
food
various
sorts
And
you
need
not
turn
your
nose
the
provender
Master
Gimli
said
Merry
This
not
orc
stuff
but
man
food
Treebeard
calls
Will
you
have
wine
beer
There
barrel
inside
there
very
passable
And
this
first
rate
salted
pork
can
cut
you
some
rashers
bacon
and
broil
them
you
like
sorry
there
green
stuff
the
deliveries
have
been
rather
interrupted
the
last
few
days
cannot
offer
you
anything
follow
but
butter
and
honey
for
your
bread
Are
you
content
Indeed
yes
said
Gimli
The
score
much
reduced
The
three
were
soon
busy
with
their
meal
and
the
two
hobbits
unabashed
set
second
time
must
keep
our
guests
company
they
said
You
are
full
courtesy
this
morning
laughed
Legolas
But
maybe
had
not
arrived
you
would
already
have
been
keeping
one
another
company
again
Maybe
and
why
not
said
Pippin
had
foul
fare
with
the
Orcs
and
little
enough
for
days
before
that
seems
long
while
since
could
eat
heart
content
does
not
seem
have
done
you
any
harm
said
Aragorn
Indeed
you
look
the
bloom
health
Aye
you
indeed
said
Gimli
looking
them
and
down
over
the
top
his
cup
Why
your
hair
twice
thick
and
curly
when
parted
and
would
swear
that
you
have
both
grown
somewhat
that
possible
for
hobbits
your
age
This
Treebeard
any
rate
has
not
starved
you
has
not
said
Merry
But
Ents
only
drink
and
drink
not
enough
for
content
Treebeard
draughts
may
nourishing
but
one
feels
the
need
something
solid
And
even
_lembas_
none
the
worse
for
change
You
have
drunk
the
waters
the
Ents
have
you
said
Legolas
then
think
likely
that
Gimli
eyes
not
deceive
him
Strange
songs
have
been
sung
the
draughts
Fangorn
Many
strange
tales
have
been
told
about
that
land
said
Aragorn
have
never
entered
Come
tell
more
about
and
about
the
Ents
Ents
said
Pippin
Ents
are
well
Ents
are
all
different
for
thing
But
their
eyes
now
their
eyes
are
very
odd
tried
few
fumbling
words
that
trailed
off
into
silence
well
went
you
have
seen
some
distance
already
they
saw
you
any
rate
and
reported
that
you
were
the
way
and
you
will
see
many
others
expect
before
you
leave
here
You
must
form
your
own
ideas
Now
now
said
Gimli
are
beginning
the
story
the
middle
should
like
tale
the
right
order
starting
with
that
strange
day
when
our
fellowship
was
broken
You
shall
have
there
time
said
Merry
But
first
you
have
finished
eating
you
shall
fill
your
pipes
and
light
And
then
for
little
while
can
pretend
that
are
all
back
safe
Bree
again
Rivendell
produced
small
leather
bag
full
tobacco
have
heaps
said
and
you
can
all
pack
much
you
wish
when
did
some
salvage
work
this
morning
Pippin
and
There
are
lots
things
floating
about
was
Pippin
who
found
two
small
barrels
washed
out
some
cellar
store
house
suppose
When
opened
them
found
they
were
filled
with
this
fine
pipe
weed
you
could
wish
for
and
quite
unspoilt
Gimli
took
some
and
rubbed
his
palms
and
sniffed
feels
good
and
smells
good
said
good
said
Merry
dear
Gimli
Longbottom
Leaf
There
were
the
Hornblower
brandmarks
the
barrels
plain
plain
How
came
here
can
imagine
For
Saruman
private
use
fancy
never
knew
that
went
far
abroad
But
comes
handy
now
would
said
Gimli
had
pipe
with
Alas
lost
mine
Moria
before
there
pipe
all
your
plunder
afraid
not
said
Merry
have
not
found
any
not
even
here
the
guardrooms
Saruman
kept
this
dainty
himself
seems
And
don
think
would
any
use
knocking
the
doors
Orthanc
beg
pipe
him
shall
have
share
pipes
good
friends
must
pinch
Half
moment
said
Pippin
Putting
his
hand
inside
the
breast
his
jacket
pulled
out
little
soft
wallet
string
keep
treasure
two
near
skin
precious
Rings
Here
one
old
wooden
pipe
And
here
another
unused
one
have
carried
long
way
though
don
know
why
never
really
expected
find
any
pipe
weed
the
journey
when
own
ran
out
But
now
comes
useful
after
all
held
small
pipe
with
wide
flattened
bowl
and
handed
Gimli
Does
that
settle
the
score
between
said
Settle
cried
Gimli
Most
noble
hobbit
leaves
deep
your
debt
Well
going
back
into
the
open
air
see
what
the
wind
and
sky
are
doing
said
Legolas
will
come
with
you
said
Aragorn
They
went
out
and
seated
themselves
upon
the
piled
stones
before
the
gateway
They
could
see
far
down
into
the
valley
now
the
mists
were
lifting
and
floating
away
upon
the
breeze
Now
let
take
our
ease
here
for
little
said
Aragorn
will
sit
the
edge
ruin
and
talk
Gandalf
says
while
busy
elsewhere
feel
weariness
such
have
seldom
felt
before
wrapped
his
grey
cloak
about
him
hiding
his
mail
shirt
and
stretched
out
his
long
legs
Then
lay
back
and
sent
from
his
lips
thin
stream
smoke
Look
said
Pippin
Strider
the
Ranger
has
come
back
has
never
been
away
said
Aragorn
Strider
and
Dúnadan
too
and
belong
both
Gondor
and
the
North
They
smoked
silence
for
while
and
the
sun
shone
them
slanting
into
the
valley
from
among
white
clouds
high
the
West
Legolas
lay
still
looking
the
sun
and
sky
with
steady
eyes
and
singing
softly
himself
last
sat
Come
now
said
Time
wears
and
the
mists
are
blowing
away
would
you
strange
folk
did
not
wreathe
yourselves
smoke
What
the
tale
Well
tale
begins
with
waking
the
dark
and
finding
myself
all
strung
orc
camp
said
Pippin
Let
see
what
today
The
fifth
March
the
Shire
reckoning
said
Aragorn
Pippin
made
some
calculations
his
fingers
Only
nine
days
ago
said
seems
year
since
were
caught
Well
though
half
was
like
bad
dream
reckon
that
three
very
horrible
days
followed
Merry
will
correct
forget
anything
important
not
going
into
details
the
whips
and
the
filth
and
stench
and
all
that
does
not
bear
remembering
With
that
plunged
into
account
Boromir
last
fight
and
the
orc
march
from
Emyn
Muil
the
Forest
The
others
nodded
the
various
points
were
fitted
with
their
guesses
Here
are
some
treasures
that
you
let
fall
said
Aragorn
You
will
glad
have
them
back
loosened
his
belt
from
under
his
cloak
and
took
from
the
two
sheathed
knives
Well
said
Merry
never
expected
see
those
again
marked
few
orcs
with
mine
but
Uglúk
took
them
from
How
glared
first
thought
was
going
stab
but
threw
the
things
away
they
burned
him
And
here
also
your
brooch
Pippin
said
Aragorn
have
kept
safe
for
very
precious
thing
know
said
Pippin
was
wrench
let
but
what
else
could
Nothing
else
answered
Aragorn
One
who
cannot
cast
away
treasure
need
fetters
You
did
rightly
The
cutting
the
bands
your
wrists
that
was
smart
work
said
Gimli
Luck
served
you
there
but
you
seized
your
chance
with
both
hands
one
might
say
And
set
pretty
riddle
said
Legolas
wondered
you
had
grown
wings
Unfortunately
not
said
Pippin
But
you
did
not
know
about
Grishnákh
shuddered
and
said
more
leaving
Merry
tell
those
last
horrible
moments
the
pawing
hands
the
hot
breath
and
the
dreadful
strength
Grishnákh
hairy
arms
All
this
about
the
Orcs
Barad
dûr
Lugbúrz
they
call
makes
uneasy
said
Aragorn
The
Dark
Lord
already
knew
too
much
and
his
servants
also
and
Grishnákh
evidently
sent
some
message
across
the
River
after
the
quarrel
The
Red
Eye
will
looking
towards
Isengard
But
Saruman
any
rate
cleft
stick
his
own
cutting
Yes
whichever
side
wins
his
outlook
poor
said
Merry
Things
began
all
wrong
for
him
from
the
moment
his
Orcs
set
foot
Rohan
caught
glimpse
the
old
villain
Gandalf
hints
said
Gimli
the
edge
the
Forest
When
was
that
asked
Pippin
Five
nights
ago
said
Aragorn
Let
see
said
Merry
five
nights
ago
now
come
part
the
story
you
know
nothing
about
met
Treebeard
that
morning
after
the
battle
and
that
night
were
Wellinghall
one
his
ent
houses
The
next
morning
went
Entmoot
gathering
Ents
that
and
the
queerest
thing
have
ever
seen
life
lasted
all
that
day
and
the
next
and
spent
the
nights
with
Ent
called
Quickbeam
And
then
late
the
afternoon
the
third
day
their
moot
the
Ents
suddenly
blew
was
amazing
The
Forest
had
felt
tense
thunderstorm
was
brewing
inside
then
all
once
exploded
wish
you
could
have
heard
their
song
they
marched
Saruman
had
heard
would
hundred
miles
away
now
even
had
had
run
his
own
legs
said
Pippin
Though
Isengard
strong
and
hard
cold
stone
and
bare
bone
war
hew
the
stone
and
break
the
door
There
was
very
much
more
great
deal
the
song
had
words
and
was
like
music
horns
and
drums
was
very
exciting
But
thought
was
only
marching
music
and
more
just
song
until
got
here
know
better
now
came
down
over
the
last
ridge
into
Nan
Curunír
after
night
had
fallen
Merry
continued
was
then
that
first
had
the
feeling
that
the
Forest
itself
was
moving
behind
thought
was
dreaming
entish
dream
but
Pippin
had
noticed
too
were
both
frightened
but
did
not
find
out
more
about
until
later
was
the
Huorns
the
Ents
call
them
short
language
Treebeard
won
say
much
about
them
but
think
they
are
Ents
that
have
become
almost
like
trees
least
look
They
stand
here
and
there
the
wood
under
its
eaves
silent
watching
endlessly
over
the
trees
but
deep
the
darkest
dales
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
them
believe
There
great
power
them
and
they
seem
able
wrap
themselves
shadow
difficult
see
them
moving
But
they
They
can
move
very
quickly
they
are
angry
You
stand
still
looking
the
weather
maybe
listening
the
rustling
the
wind
and
then
suddenly
you
find
that
you
are
the
middle
wood
with
great
groping
trees
all
around
you
They
still
have
voices
and
can
speak
with
the
Ents
that
why
they
are
called
Huorns
Treebeard
says
but
they
have
become
queer
and
wild
Dangerous
should
terrified
meeting
them
there
were
true
Ents
about
look
after
them
Well
the
early
night
crept
down
long
ravine
into
the
upper
end
the
Wizard
Vale
the
Ents
with
all
their
rustling
Huorns
behind
could
not
see
them
course
but
the
whole
air
was
full
creaking
was
very
dark
cloudy
night
They
moved
great
speed
soon
they
had
left
the
hills
and
made
noise
like
rushing
wind
The
Moon
did
not
appear
through
the
clouds
and
not
long
after
midnight
there
was
tall
wood
all
round
the
north
side
Isengard
There
was
sign
enemies
nor
any
challenge
There
was
light
gleaming
from
high
window
the
tower
that
was
all
Treebeard
and
few
more
Ents
crept
right
round
within
sight
the
great
gates
Pippin
and
were
with
him
were
sitting
Treebeard
shoulders
and
could
feel
the
quivering
tenseness
him
But
even
when
they
are
roused
Ents
can
very
cautious
and
patient
They
stood
still
carved
stones
breathing
and
listening
Then
all
once
there
was
tremendous
stir
Trumpets
blared
and
the
walls
Isengard
echoed
thought
that
had
been
discovered
and
that
battle
was
going
begin
But
nothing
the
sort
All
Saruman
people
were
marching
away
don
know
much
about
this
war
about
the
Horsemen
Rohan
but
Saruman
seems
have
meant
finish
off
the
king
and
all
his
men
with
one
final
blow
emptied
Isengard
saw
the
enemy
endless
lines
marching
Orcs
and
troops
them
mounted
great
wolves
And
there
were
battalions
Men
too
Many
them
carried
torches
and
the
flare
could
see
their
faces
Most
them
were
ordinary
men
rather
tall
and
dark
haired
and
grim
but
not
particularly
evil
looking
But
there
were
some
others
that
were
horrible
man
high
but
with
goblin
faces
sallow
leering
squint
eyed
you
know
they
reminded
once
that
Southerner
Bree
only
was
not
obviously
orc
like
most
these
were
thought
him
too
said
Aragorn
had
many
these
half
orcs
deal
with
Helm
Deep
seems
plain
now
that
that
Southerner
was
spy
Saruman
but
whether
was
working
with
the
Black
Riders
for
Saruman
alone
not
know
difficult
with
these
evil
folk
know
when
they
are
league
and
when
they
are
cheating
one
another
Well
all
sorts
together
there
must
have
been
ten
thousand
the
very
least
said
Merry
They
took
hour
pass
out
the
gates
Some
went
off
down
the
highway
the
Fords
and
some
turned
away
and
went
eastward
bridge
has
been
built
down
there
about
mile
away
where
the
river
runs
very
deep
channel
You
could
see
now
you
stood
They
were
all
singing
with
harsh
voices
and
laughing
making
hideous
din
thought
things
looked
very
black
for
Rohan
But
Treebeard
did
not
move
said
business
with
Isengard
tonight
with
rock
and
stone
But
though
could
not
see
what
was
happening
the
dark
believe
that
Huorns
began
move
south
soon
the
gates
were
shut
again
Their
business
was
with
Orcs
think
They
were
far
down
the
valley
the
morning
any
rate
there
was
shadow
there
that
one
couldn
see
through
soon
Saruman
had
sent
off
all
his
army
our
turn
came
Treebeard
put
down
and
went
the
gates
and
began
hammering
the
doors
and
calling
for
Saruman
There
was
answer
except
arrows
and
stones
from
the
walls
But
arrows
are
use
against
Ents
They
hurt
them
course
and
infuriate
them
like
stinging
flies
But
Ent
can
stuck
full
orc
arrows
pin
cushion
and
take
serious
harm
They
cannot
poisoned
for
one
thing
and
their
skin
seems
very
thick
and
tougher
than
bark
takes
very
heavy
axe
stroke
wound
them
seriously
They
don
like
axes
But
there
would
have
great
many
axe
men
one
Ent

When
Treebeard
had

arrows
him

positively
hasty
would
say
let
out
great
_hoom
hom_
and
dozen

Ents
came
striding

Ent

Their

and
their

just
freeze

and
they
tear
like
bread
crust
was
like
watching
the
work
great
tree

all
packed
into
few
moments
They
pushed

tore
shook
and
hammered
and
_clang

_crash

five
minutes
they
had
these
huge
gates
just
lying
ruin
and
some
were
already
beginning
eat
into
the
walls
like
rabbits

don
know
what
Saruman
thought
was
happening
but
anyway
did
not
know
how

with
His

and
things
you

mean
Very
different
from
old
Gandalf
wonder
his
fame
was
not
all
along
mainly
due
his
cleverness
settling
Isengard
said
Aragorn
Once
was
great
his
fame
made
him
His
knowledge
was
deep
his
thought
was
subtle
and
his
hands
marvellously
skilled
and
had
power
over
the
minds
others
The
wise
could
persuade
and
the
smaller
folk
could
daunt
That
power
certainly
still
keeps
There
are
not
many
Middle
earth
that
should
say
were
safe
they
were
left
alone
talk
with
him
even
now
when
has
suffered
defeat
Gandalf
Elrond
and
Galadriel
perhaps
now
that
his
wickedness
has
been
laid
bare
but
very
few
others
The
Ents
are
safe
said
Pippin
seems
one
time
have
got
round
them
but
never
again
And
anyway
did
not
understand
them
and
made
the
great
mistake
leaving
them
out
his
calculations
had
plan
for
them
and
there
was
time
make
any
once
they
had
set
work
soon
our
attack
began
the
few
remaining
rats
Isengard
started
bolting
through
every
hole
that
the
Ents
made
The
Ents
let
the
Men
after
they
had
questioned
them
two
three
dozen
only
down
this
end
don
think
many
orc
folk
any
size
escaped
Not
from
the
Huorns
there
was
wood
full
them
all
round
Isengard
that
time
well
those
that
had
gone
down
the
valley
When
the
Ents
had
reduced
large
part
the
southern
walls
rubbish
and
what
was
left
his
people
had
bolted
and
deserted
him
Saruman
fled
panic
seems
have
been
the
gates
when
arrived
expect
came
watch
his
splendid
army
march
out
When
the
Ents
broke
their
way
left
hurry
They
did
not
spot
him
first
But
the
night
had
opened
out
and
there
was
great
light
stars
quite
enough
for
Ents
see
and
suddenly
Quickbeam
gave
cry
The
tree
killer
the
tree
killer
Quickbeam
gentle
creature
but
hates
Saruman
all
the
more
fiercely
for
that
his
people
suffered
cruelly
from
orc
axes
leapt
down
the
path
from
the
inner
gate
and
can
move
like
wind
when
roused
There
was
pale
figure
hurrying
away
and
out
the
shadows
the
pillars
and
had
nearly
reached
the
stairs
the
tower
door
But
was
near
thing
Quickbeam
was
hot
after
him
that
was
within
step
two
being
caught
and
strangled
when
slipped
through
the
door
When
Saruman
was
safe
back
Orthanc
was
not
long
before
set
some
his
precious
machinery
work
that
time
there
were
many
Ents
inside
Isengard
some
had
followed
Quickbeam
and
others
had
burst
from
the
north
and
east
they
were
roaming
about
and
doing
great
deal
damage
Suddenly
came
fires
and
foul
fumes
the
vents
and
shafts
all
over
the
plain
began
spout
and
belch
Several
the
Ents
got
scorched
and
blistered
One
them
Beechbone
think
was
called
very
tall
handsome
Ent
got
caught
spray
some
liquid
fire
and
burned
like
torch
horrible
sight
That
sent
them
mad
thought
that
they
had
been
really
roused
before
but
was
wrong
saw
what
was
like
last
was
staggering
They
roared
and
boomed
and
trumpeted
until
stones
began
crack
and
fall
the
mere
noise
them
Merry
and
lay
the
ground
and
stuffed
our
cloaks
into
our
ears
Round
and
round
the
rock
Orthanc
the
Ents
went
striding
and
storming
like
howling
gale
breaking
pillars
hurling
avalanches
boulders
down
the
shafts
tossing
huge
slabs
stone
into
the
air
like
leaves
The
tower
was
the
middle
spinning
whirlwind
saw
iron
posts
and
blocks
masonry
rocketing
hundreds
feet
and
smash
against
the
windows
Orthanc
But
Treebeard
kept
his
head
had
not
had
any
burns
luckily
did
not
want
his
folk
hurt
themselves
their
fury
and
did
not
want
Saruman
escape
out
some
hole
the
confusion
Many
the
Ents
were
hurling
themselves
against
the
Orthanc
rock
but
that
defeated
them
very
smooth
and
hard
Some
wizardry
perhaps
older
and
stronger
than
Saruman
Anyway
they
could
not
get
grip
make
crack
and
they
were
bruising
and
wounding
themselves
against
Treebeard
went
out
into
the
ring
and
shouted
His
enormous
voice
rose
above
all
the
din
There
was
dead
silence
suddenly
heard
shrill
laugh
from
high
window
the
tower
That
had
queer
effect
the
Ents
They
had
been
boiling
over
now
they
became
cold
grim
ice
and
quiet
They
left
the
plain
and
gathered
round
Treebeard
standing
quite
still
spoke
them
for
little
their
own
language
think
was
telling
them
plan
had
made
his
old
head
long
before
Then
they
just
faded
silently
away
the
grey
light
Day
was
dawning
that
time
They
set
watch
the
tower
believe
but
the
watchers
were
well
hidden
shadows
and
kept
still
that
could
not
see
them
The
others
went
away
north
All
that
day
they
were
busy
out
sight
Most
the
time
were
left
alone
was
dreary
day
and
wandered
about
bit
though
kept
out
the
view
the
windows
Orthanc
much
could
they
stared
threateningly
good
deal
the
time
spent
looking
for
something
eat
And
also
sat
and
talked
wondering
what
was
happening
away
south
Rohan
and
what
had
become
all
the
rest
our
Company
Every
now
and
then
could
hear
the
distance
the
rattle
and
fall
stone
and
thudding
noises
echoing
the
hills
the
afternoon
walked
round
the
circle
and
went
have
look
what
was
going
There
was
great
shadowy
wood
Huorns
the
head
the
valley
and
another
round
the
northern
wall
did
not
dare
But
there
was
rending
tearing
noise
work
going
inside
Ents
and
Huorns
were
digging
great
pits
and
trenches
and
making
great
pools
and
dams
gathering
all
the
waters
the
Isen
and
every
other
spring
and
stream
that
they
could
find
left
them
dusk
Treebeard
came
back
the
gate
was
humming
and
booming
himself
and
seemed
pleased
stood
and
stretched
his
great
arms
and
legs
and
breathed
deep
asked
him
was
tired
Tired
said
tired
Well
not
tired
but
stiff
need
good
draught
Entwash
have
worked
hard
have
done
more
stone
cracking
and
earth
gnawing
today
than
have
done
many
long
year
before
But
nearly
finished
When
night
falls
not
linger
near
this
gate
the
old
tunnel
Water
may
come
through
and
will
foul
water
for
while
until
all
the
filth
Saruman
washed
away
Then
Isen
can
run
clean
again
began
pull
down
bit
more
the
walls
leisurely
sort
way
just
amuse
himself
were
just
wondering
where
would
safe
lie
and
get
some
sleep
when
the
most
amazing
thing
all
happened
There
was
the
sound
rider
coming
swiftly
the
road
Merry
and
lay
quiet
and
Treebeard
hid
himself
the
shadows
under
the
arch
Suddenly
great
horse
came
striding
like
flash
silver
was
already
dark
but
could
see
the
rider
face
clearly
seemed
shine
and
all
his
clothes
were
white
just
sat
staring
with
mouth
open
tried
call
out
and
couldn
There
was
need
halted
just
and
looked
down
Gandalf
said
last
but
voice
was
only
whisper
Did
say
Hullo
Pippin
This
pleasant
surprise
indeed
said
Get
you
tom
fool
Took
Where
the
name
wonder
all
this
ruin
Treebeard
want
him
Quick
Treebeard
heard
his
voice
and
came
out
the
shadows
once
and
there
was
strange
meeting
was
surprised
because
neither
them
seemed
surprised
all
Gandalf
obviously
expected
find
Treebeard
here
and
Treebeard
might
almost
have
been
loitering
about
near
the
gates
purpose
meet
him
Yet
had
told
the
old
Ent
all
about
Moria
But
then
remembered
queer
look
gave
the
time
can
only
suppose
that
had
seen
Gandalf
had
some
news
him
but
would
not
say
anything
hurry
Don
hasty
his
motto
but
nobody
not
even
Elves
will
say
much
about
Gandalf
movements
when
not
there
Hoom
Gandalf
said
Treebeard
glad
you
have
come
Wood
and
water
stock
and
stone
can
master
but
there
Wizard
manage
here
Treebeard
said
Gandalf
need
your
help
You
have
done
much
but
need
more
have
about
ten
thousand
Orcs
manage
Then
those
two
went
off
and
had
council
together
some
corner
must
have
seemed
very
hasty
Treebeard
for
Gandalf
was
tremendous
hurry
and
was
already
talking
great
pace
before
they
passed
out
hearing
They
were
only
away
matter
minutes
perhaps
quarter
hour
Then
Gandalf
came
back
and
seemed
relieved
almost
merry
did
say
was
glad
see
then
But
Gandalf
cried
where
have
you
been
And
have
you
seen
the
others
Wherever
have
been
back
answered
the
genuine
Gandalf
manner
Yes
have
seen
some
the
others
But
news
must
wait
This
perilous
night
and
must
ride
fast
But
the
dawn
may
brighter
and
shall
meet
again
Take
care
yourselves
and
keep
away
from
Orthanc
Good
bye
Treebeard
was
very
thoughtful
after
Gandalf
had
gone
had
evidently
learnt
lot
short
time
and
was
digesting
looked
and
said
well
find
you
are
not
such
hasty
folk
thought
You
said
much
less
than
you
might
and
not
more
than
you
should
this
bundle
news
and
mistake
Well
now
Treebeard
must
get
busy
again
Before
went
got
little
news
out
him
and
did
not
cheer
all
But
for
the
moment
thought
more
about
you
three
than
about
Frodo
and
Sam
about
poor
Boromir
For
gathered
that
there
was
great
battle
going
soon
would
and
that
you
were
and
might
never
come
out
Huorns
will
help
said
Treebeard
Then
went
away
and
did
not
see
him
again
until
this
morning
was
deep
night
lay
top
pile
stone
and
could
see
nothing
beyond
Mist
shadows
blotted
out
everything
like
great
blanket
all
round
The
air
seemed
hot
and
heavy
and
was
full
rustlings
creakings
and
murmur
like
voices
passing
think
that
hundreds
more
the
Huorns
must
have
been
passing
help
the
battle
Later
there
was
great
rumble
thunder
away
south
and
flashes
lightning
far
away
across
Rohan
Every
now
and
then
could
see
mountain
peaks
miles
and
miles
away
stab
out
suddenly
black
and
white
and
then
vanish
And
behind
there
were
noises
like
thunder
hills
but
different
times
the
whole
valley
echoed
must
have
been
about
midnight
when
the
Ents
broke
the
dams
and
poured
all
the
gathered
waters
through
gap
the
northern
wall
down
into
Isengard
The
Huorn
dark
had
passed
and
the
thunder
had
rolled
away
The
Moon
was
sinking
behind
the
western
mountains
Isengard
began
fill
with
black
creeping
streams
and
pools
They
glittered
the
last
light
the
Moon
they
spread
over
the
plain
Every
now
and
then
the
waters
found
their
way
down
into
some
shaft
spouthole
Great
white
steams
hissed
Smoke
rose
billows
There
were
explosions
and
gusts
fire
One
great
coil
vapour
went
whirling
twisting
round
and
round
Orthanc
until
looked
like
tall
peak
cloud
fiery
underneath
and
moonlit
above
And
still
more
water
poured
until
last
Isengard
looked
like
huge
flat
saucepan
all
steaming
and
bubbling
saw
cloud
smoke
and
steam
from
the
south
last
night
when
came
the
mouth
Nan
Curunír
said
Aragorn
feared
that
Saruman
was
brewing
some
new
devilry
for
Not
said
Pippin
was
probably
choking
and
not
laughing
any
more
the
morning
yesterday
morning
the
water
had
sunk
down
into
all
the
holes
and
there
was
dense
fog
took
refuge
that
guardroom
over
there
and
had
rather
fright
The
lake
began
overflow
and
pour
out
through
the
old
tunnel
and
the
water
was
rapidly
rising
the
steps
thought
were
going
get
caught
like
Orcs
hole
but
found
winding
stair
the
back
the
store
room
that
brought
out
top
the
arch
was
squeeze
get
out
the
passages
had
been
cracked
and
half
blocked
with
fallen
stone
near
the
top
There
sat
high
above
the
floods
and
watched
the
drowning
Isengard
The
Ents
kept
pouring
more
water
till
all
the
fires
were
quenched
and
every
cave
filled
The
fogs
slowly
gathered
together
and
steamed
into
huge
umbrella
cloud
must
have
been
mile
high
the
evening
there
was
great
rainbow
over
the
eastern
hills
and
then
the
sunset
was
blotted
out
thick
drizzle
the
mountain
sides
all
went
very
quiet
few
wolves
howled
mournfully
far
away
The
Ents
stopped
the
inflow
the
night
and
sent
the
Isen
back
into
its
old
course
And
that
was
the
end
all
Since
then
the
water
has
been
sinking
again
There
must
outlets
somewhere
from
the
caves
underneath
think
Saruman
peeps
out
any
his
windows
must
look
untidy
dreary
mess
felt
very
lonely
Not
even
visible
Ent
talk
all
the
ruin
and
news
spent
the
night
top
there
above
the
arch
and
was
cold
and
damp
and
did
not
sleep
had
feeling
that
anything
might
happen
any
minute
Saruman
still
his
tower
There
was
noise
the
night
like
wind
coming
the
valley
think
the
Ents
and
Huorns
that
had
been
away
came
back
then
but
where
they
have
all
gone
now
don
know
was
misty
moisty
morning
when
climbed
down
and
looked
round
again
and
nobody
was
about
And
that
about
all
there
tell
seems
almost
peaceful
now
after
all
the
turmoil
And
safer
too
somehow
since
Gandalf
came
back
could
sleep
They
all
fell
silent
for
while
Gimli
filled
his
pipe
There
one
thing
wonder
about
said
lit
with
his
flint
and
tinder
Wormtongue
You
told
Théoden
was
with
Saruman
How
did
get
there
yes
forgot
about
him
said
Pippin
did
not
get
here
till
this
morning
had
just
lit
the
fire
and
had
some
breakfast
when
Treebeard
appeared
again
heard
him
hooming
and
calling
our
names
outside
have
just
come
round
see
how
you
are
faring
lads
said
and
give
you
some
news
Huorns
have
come
back
All
well
aye
very
well
indeed
laughed
and
slapped
his
thighs
more
Orcs
Isengard
more
axes
And
there
will
folk
coming
from
the
South
before
the
day
old
some
that
you
may
glad
see
had
hardly
said
that
when
heard
the
sound
hoofs
the
road
rushed
out
before
the
gates
and
stood
and
stared
half
expecting
see
Strider
and
Gandalf
come
riding
the
head
army
But
out
the
mist
there
rode
man
old
tired
horse
and
looked
queer
twisted
sort
creature
himself
There
was
one
else
When
came
out
the
mist
and
suddenly
saw
all
the
ruin
and
wreckage
front
him
sat
and
gaped
and
his
face
went
almost
green
was
bewildered
that
did
not
seem
notice
first
When
did
gave
cry
and
tried
turn
his
horse
round
and
ride
off
But
Treebeard
took
three
strides
put
out
long
arm
and
lifted
him
out
the
saddle
His
horse
bolted
terror
and
grovelled
the
ground
said
was
Gríma
friend
and
counsellor
the
king
and
had
been
sent
with
important
messages
from
Théoden
Saruman
one
else
would
dare
ride
through
the
open
land
full
foul
Orcs
said
was
sent
And
have
had
perilous
journey
and
hungry
and
weary
fled
far
north
out
way
pursued
wolves
caught
the
sidelong
looks
gave
Treebeard
and
said
myself
liar
Treebeard
looked
him
his
long
slow
way
for
several
minutes
till
the
wretched
man
was
squirming
the
floor
Then
last
said
was
expecting
you
Master
Wormtongue
The
man
started
that
name
Gandalf
got
here
first
know
much
about
you
need
and
know
what
with
you
Put
all
the
rats
one
trap
said
Gandalf
and
will
the
master
Isengard
now
but
Saruman
locked
his
tower
and
you
can
there
and
give
him
all
the
messages
that
you
can
think
Let
let
said
Wormtongue
know
the
way
You
knew
the
way
don
doubt
said
Treebeard
But
things
have
changed
here
little
and
see
let
Wormtongue
and
limped
off
through
the
arch
with
close
behind
until
came
inside
the
ring
and
could
see
all
the
floods
that
lay
between
him
and
Orthanc
Then
turned
Let
away
whined
Let
away
messages
are
useless
now
They
are
indeed
said
Treebeard
But
you
have
only
two
choices
stay
with
until
Gandalf
and
your
master
arrive
cross
the
water
Which
will
you
have
The
man
shivered
the
mention
his
master
and
put
foot
into
the
water
but
drew
back
cannot
swim
said
The
water
not
deep
said
Treebeard
dirty
but
that
will
not
harm
you
Master
Wormtongue
you
now
With
that
the
wretch
floundered
off
into
the
flood
rose
nearly
his
neck
before
got
too
far
away
for
see
him
The
last
saw
him
was
clinging
some
old
barrel
piece
wood
But
Treebeard
waded
after
him
and
watched
his
progress
Well
has
gone
said
when
returned
saw
him
crawling
the
steps
like
draggled
rat
There
someone
the
tower
still
hand
came
out
and
pulled
him
there
and
hope
the
welcome
his
liking
Now
must
and
wash
myself
clean
the
slime
away
the
north
side
anyone
wants
see
There
clean
water
down
here
fit
for
Ent
drink
bathe
will
ask
you
two
lads
keep
watch
the
gate
for
the
folk
that
are
coming
There
the
Lord
the
Fields
Rohan
mark
you
You
must
welcome
him
well
you
know
how
his
men
have
fought
great
fight
with
the
Orcs
Maybe
you
know
the
right
fashion
Men
words
for
such
lord
better
than
Ents
There
have
been
many
lords
the
green
fields
time
and
have
never
learned
their
speech
their
names
They
will
wanting
man
food
and
you
know
all
about
that
guess
find
what
you
think
fit
for
king
eat
you
can
And
that
the
end
the
story
Though
should
like
know
who
this
Wormtongue
Was
really
the
king
counsellor
was
said
Aragorn
and
also
Saruman
spy
and
servant
Rohan
Fate
has
not
been
kinder
him
than
deserves
The
sight
the
ruin
all
that
thought
strong
and
magnificent
must
have
been
almost
punishment
enough
But
fear
that
worse
awaits
him
Yes
don
suppose
Treebeard
sent
him
Orthanc
out
kindness
said
Merry
seemed
rather
grimly
delighted
with
the
business
and
was
laughing
himself
when
went
get
his
bathe
and
drink
spent
busy
time
after
that
searching
the
flotsam
and
rummaging
about
found
two
three
store
rooms
different
places
nearby
above
the
flood
level
But
Treebeard
sent
some
Ents
down
and
they
carried
off
great
deal
the
stuff
want
man
food
for
twenty
five
the
Ents
said
you
can
see
that
somebody
had
counted
your
company
carefully
before
you
arrived
You
three
were
evidently
meant
with
the
great
people
But
you
would
not
have
fared
any
better
kept
good
sent
promise
you
Better
because
sent
drink
What
about
drink
said
the
Ents
There
water
Isen
they
said
and
that
good
enough
for
Ents
and
Men
But
hope
that
the
Ents
may
have
found
time
brew
some
their
draughts
from
the
mountain
springs
and
shall
see
Gandalf
beard
curling
when
returns
After
the
Ents
had
gone
felt
tired
and
hungry
But
did
not
grumble
our
labours
had
been
well
rewarded
was
through
our
search
for
man
food
that
Pippin
discovered
the
prize
all
the
flotsam
those
Hornblower
barrels
Pipe
weed
better
after
food
said
Pippin
that
how
the
situation
arose
understand
all
perfectly
now
said
Gimli
All
except
one
thing
said
Aragorn
leaf
from
the
Southfarthing
Isengard
The
more
consider
the
more
curious
find
have
never
been
Isengard
but
have
journeyed
this
land
and
know
well
the
empty
countries
that
lie
between
Rohan
and
the
Shire
Neither
goods
nor
folk
have
passed
that
way
for
many
long
year
not
openly
Saruman
had
secret
dealings
with
someone
the
Shire
guess
Wormtongues
may
found
other
houses
than
King
Théoden
Was
there
date
the
barrels
Yes
said
Pippin
was
the
1417
crop
that
last
year
the
year
before
course
now
good
year
well
whatever
evil
was
afoot
over
now
hope
else
beyond
our
reach
present
said
Aragorn
Yet
think
shall
mention
Gandalf
small
matter
though
may
seem
among
his
great
affairs
wonder
what
doing
said
Merry
The
afternoon
getting
Let
and
look
round
You
can
enter
Isengard
now
any

Strider
you
want
But

_Chapter
10_
The
Voice
Saruman
They
passed
through
the
ruined
tunnel
and
stood
upon
heap
stones
gazing
the
dark
rock
Orthanc
and
its
many
windows
menace
still
the
desolation
that
lay
all
about
The
waters
had
now
nearly
all
subsided
Here
and
there
gloomy
pools
remained
covered
with
scum
and
wreckage
but
most
the
wide
circle
was
bare
again
wilderness
slime
and
tumbled
rock
pitted
with
blackened
holes
and
dotted
with
posts
and
pillars
leaning
drunkenly
this
way
and
that
the
rim
the
shattered
bowl
there
lay
vast
mounds
and
slopes
like
the
shingles
cast
great
storm
and
beyond
them
the
green
and
tangled
valley
ran
into
the
long
ravine
between
the
dark
arms
the
mountains
Across
the
waste
they
saw
riders
picking
their
way
they
were
coming
from
the
north
side
and
already
they
were
drawing
near
Orthanc
There
Gandalf
and
Théoden
and
his
men
said
Legolas
Let
and
meet
them
Walk
warily
said
Merry
There
are
loose
slabs
that
may
tilt
and
throw
you
down
into
pit
you
don
take
care
They
followed
what
was
left
the
road
from
the
gates
Orthanc
going
slowly
for
the
flag
stones
were
cracked
and
slimed
The
riders
seeing
them
approach
halted
under
the
shadow
the
rock
and
waited
for
them
Gandalf
rode
forward
meet
them
Well
Treebeard
and
have
had
some
interesting
discussions
and
made
few
plans
said
and
have
all
had
some
much
needed
rest
Now
must
going
again
hope
you
companions
have
all
rested
too
and
refreshed
yourselves
have
said
Merry
But
our
discussions
began
and
ended
smoke
Still
feel
less
ill
disposed
towards
Saruman
than
did
you
indeed
said
Gandalf
Well
not
have
now
last
task
before
must
pay
Saruman
farewell
visit
Dangerous
and
probably
useless
but
must
done
Those
you
who
wish
may
come
with
but
beware
And
not
jest
This
not
the
time
for
will
come
said
Gimli
wish
see
him
and
learn
really
looks
like
you
And
how
will
you
learn
that
Master
Dwarf
said
Gandalf
Saruman
could
look
like
your
eyes
suited
his
purpose
with
you
And
are
you
yet
wise
enough
detect
all
his
counterfeits
Well
shall
see
perhaps
may
shy
showing
himself
before
many
different
eyes
together
But
have
ordered
all
the
Ents
remove
themselves
from
sight
perhaps
shall
persuade
him
come
out
What
the
danger
asked
Pippin
Will
shoot
and
pour
fire
out
the
windows
can
put
spell
from
distance
The
last
most
likely
you
ride
his
door
with
light
heart
said
Gandalf
But
there
knowing
what
can
may
choose
try
wild
beast
cornered
not
safe
approach
And
Saruman
has
powers
you
not
guess
Beware
his
voice
They
came
now
the
foot
Orthanc
was
black
and
the
rock
gleamed
were
wet
The
many
faces
the
stone
had
sharp
edges
though
they
had
been
newly
chiselled
few
scorings
and
small
flake
like
splinters
near
the
base
were
all
the
marks
that
bore
the
fury
the
Ents
the
eastern
side
the
angle
two
piers
there
was
great
door
high
above
the
ground
and
over
was
shuttered
window
opening
upon
balcony
hedged
with
iron
bars
the
threshold
the
door
there
mounted
flight
twenty
seven
broad
stairs
hewn
some
unknown
art
the
same
black
stone
This
was
the
only
entrance
the
tower
but
many
tall
windows
were
cut
with
deep
embrasures
the
climbing
walls
far
they
peered
like
little
eyes
the
sheer
faces
the
horns
the
foot
the
stairs
Gandalf
and
the
king
dismounted
will
said
Gandalf
have
been
Orthanc
and
know
peril
And
too
will
said
the
king
old
and
fear
peril
any
more
wish
speak
with
the
enemy
who
has
done
much
wrong
Éomer
shall
come
with
and
see
that
aged
feet
not
falter
you
will
said
Gandalf
Aragorn
shall
come
with
Let
the
others
await
the
foot
the
stairs
They
will
hear
and
see
enough
there
anything
hear
see
Nay
said
Gimli
Legolas
and
wish
for
closer
view
alone
here
represent
our
kindred
also
will
come
behind
Come
then
said
Gandalf
and
with
that
climbed
the
steps
and
Théoden
went
beside
him
The
Riders
Rohan
sat
uneasily
upon
their
horses
either
side
the
stair
and
looked
darkly
the
great
tower
fearing
what
might
befall
their
lord
Merry
and
Pippin
sat
the
bottom
step
feeling
both
unimportant
and
unsafe
Half
sticky
mile
from
here
the
gate
muttered
Pippin
wish
could
slip
off
back
the
guardroom
unnoticed
What
did
come
for
are
not
wanted
Gandalf
stood
before
the
door
Orthanc
and
beat
with
his
staff
rang
with
hollow
sound
Saruman
Saruman
cried
loud
commanding
voice
Saruman
come
forth
For
some
time
there
was
answer
last
the
window
above
the
door
was
unbarred
hut
figure
could
seen
its
dark
opening
Who
said
voice
What
you
wish
Théoden
started
know
that
voice
said
and
curse
the
day
when
first
listened
and
fetch
Saruman
since
you
have
become
his
footman
Gríma
Wormtongue
said
Gandalf
And
not
waste
our
time
The
window
closed
They
waited
Suddenly
another
voice
spoke
low
and
melodious
its
very
sound
enchantment
Those
who
listened
unwarily
that
voice
could
seldom
report
the
words
that
they
heard
and
they
did
they
wondered
for
little
power
remained
them
Mostly
they
remembered
only
that
was
delight
hear
the
voice
speaking
all
that
said
seemed
wise
and
reasonable
and
desire
awoke
them
swift
agreement
seem
wise
themselves
When
others
spoke
they
seemed
harsh
and
uncouth
contrast
and
they
gainsaid
the
voice
anger
was
kindled
the
hearts
those
under
the
spell
Fur
some
the
spell
lasted
only
while
the
voice
spoke
them
and
when
spake
another
they
smiled
men
who
see
through
juggler
trick
while
others
gape
For
many
the
sound
the
voice
alone
was
enough
hold
them
enthralled
but
for
those
whom
conquered
the
spell
endured
when
they
were
far
away
and
ever
they
heard
that
soft
voice
whispering
and
urging
them
But
none
were
unmoved
none
rejected
its
pleas
and
its
commands
without
effort
mind
and
will
long
its
master
had
control
Well
said
now
with
gentle
question
Why
must
you
disturb
rest
Will
you
give
peace
all
night
day
Its
tone
was
that
kindly
heart
aggrieved
injuries
undeserved
They
looked
astonished
for
they
had
heard
sound
his
coming
and
they
saw
figure
standing
the
rail
looking
down
upon
them
old
man
swathed
great
cloak
the
colour
which
was
not
easy
tell
for
changed
they
moved
their
eyes
stirred
His
face
was
long
with
high
forehead
had
deep
darkling
eyes
hard
fathom
though
the
look
that
they
now
bore
was
grave
and
benevolent
and
little
weary
His
hair
and
beard
were
white
but
strands
black
still
showed
about
his
lips
and
ears
Like
and
yet
unlike
muttered
Gimli
But
come
now
said
the
soft
voice
Two
least
you
know
name
Gandalf
know
too
well
have
much
hope
that
seeks
help
counsel
here
But
you
Théoden
Lord
the
Mark
Rohan
are
declared
your
noble
devices
and
still
more
the
fair
countenance
the
House
Eorl
worthy
son
Thengel
the
Thrice
renowned
Why
have
you
not
come
before
and
friend
Much
have
desired
see
you
mightiest
king
western
lands
and
especially
these
latter
years
save
you
from
the
unwise
and
evil
counsels
that
beset
you
yet
too
late
Despite
the
injuries
that
have
been
done
which
the
men
Rohan
alas
have
had
some
part
still
would
save
you
and
deliver
you
from
the
ruin
that
draws
nigh
inevitably
you
ride
upon
this
road
which
you
have
taken
Indeed
alone
can
aid
you
now
Théoden
opened
his
mouth
speak
but
said
nothing
looked
the
face
Saruman
with
its
dark
solemn
eyes
bent
down
upon
him
and
then
Gandalf
his
side
and
seemed
hesitate
Gandalf
made
sign
but
stood
silent
stone
one
waiting
patiently
for
some
call
that
has
not
yet
come
The
Riders
stirred
first
murmuring
with
approval
the
words
Saruman
and
then
they
too
were
silent
men
spell
bound
seemed
them
that
Gandalf
had
never
spoken
fair
and
fittingly
their
lord
Rough
and
proud
now
seemed
all
his
dealings
with
Théoden
And
over
their
hearts
crept
shadow
the
fear
great
danger
the
end
the
Mark
darkness
which
Gandalf
was
driving
them
while
Saruman
stood
beside
door
escape
holding
half
open
that
ray
light
came
through
There
was
heavy
silence
was
Gimli
the
dwarf
who
broke
suddenly
The
words
this
wizard
stand
their
heads
growled
gripping
the
handle
his
axe
the
language
Orthanc
help
means
ruin
and
saving
means
slaying
that
plain
But
not
come
here
beg
Peace
said
Saruman
and
for
fleeting
moment
his
voice
was
less
suave
and
light
flickered
his
eyes
and
was
gone
not
speak
you
yet
Gimli
Glóin
son
said
Far
away
your
home
and
small
concern
yours
are
the
troubles
this
land
But
was
not
design
your
own
that
you
became
embroiled
them
and
will
not
blame
such
part
you
have
played
valiant
one
doubt
not
But
pray
you
allow
first
speak
with
the
King
Rohan
neighbour
and
once
friend
What
have
you
say
Théoden
King
Will
you
have
peace
with
and
all
the
aid
that
knowledge
founded
long
years
can
bring
Shall
make
our
counsels
together
against
evil
days
and
repair
our
injuries
with
such
good
will
that
our
estates
shall
both
come
fairer
flower
than
ever
before
Still
Théoden
did
not
answer
Whether
strove
with
anger
doubt
none
could
say
Éomer
spoke
Lord
hear
said
Now
feel
the
peril
that
were
warned
Have
ridden
forth
victory
only
stand
last
amazed
old
liar
with
honey
his
forked
tongue
would
the
trapped
wolf
speak
the
hounds
could
What
aid
can
give
you
forsooth
All
desires
escape
from
his
plight
But
will
you
parley
with
this
dealer
treachery
and
murder
Remember
Théodred
the
Fords
and
the
grave
Háma
Helm
Deep
speak
poisoned
tongues
what
shall
say
yours
young
serpent
said
Saruman
and
the
flash
his
anger
was
now
plain
see
But
come
Éomer
Éomund
son
went
his
soft
voice
again
every
man
part
Valour
arms
yours
and
you
win
high
honour
thereby
Slay
whom
your
lord
names
enemies
and
content
Meddle
not
policies
which
you
not
understand
But
maybe
you
become
king
you
Will
find
that
must
choose
his
friends
with
care
The
friendship
Saruman
and
the
power
Orthanc
cannot
lightly
thrown
aside
whatever
grievances
real
fancied
may
lie
behind
You
have
won
battle
but
not
war
and
that
with
help
which
you
cannot
count
again
You
may
find
the
Shadow
the
Wood
your
own
door
next
wayward
and
senseless
and
has
love
for
Men
But
lord
Rohan
called
murderer
because
valiant
men
have
fallen
battle
you
war
needlessly
for
did
not
desire
then
men
will
slain
But
murderer
that
account
then
all
the
House
Eorl
stained
with
murder
for
they
have
fought
many
wars
and
assailed
many
who
defied
them
Yet
with
some
they
have
afterwards
made
peace
none
the
worse
for
being
politic
say
Théoden
King
shall
have
peace
and
friendship
you
and
ours
command
will
have
peace
said
Théoden
last
thickly
and
with
effort
Several
the
Riders
cried
out
gladly
Théoden
held
his
hand
Yes
will
have
peace
said
now
clear
voice
will
have
peace
when
you
and
all
your
works
have
perished
and
the
works
your
dark
master
whom
you
would
deliver
You
are
liar
Saruman
and
corrupter
men
hearts
You
hold
out
your
hand
and
perceive
only
finger
the
claw
Mordor
Cruel
and
cold
Even
your
war
was
just
was
not
for
were
you
ten
times
wise
you
would
have
right
rule
and
mine
for
your
own
profit
you
desired
even
what
will
you
say
your
torches
Westfold
and
the
children
that
lie
dead
there
And
they
hewed
Háma
body
before
the
gates
the
Hornburg
after
was
dead
When
you
hang
from
gibbet
your
window
for
the
sport
your
own
crows
will
have
peace
with
you
and
Orthanc
much
for
the
House
Eorl
lesser
son
great
sires
but
not
need
lick
your
fingers
Turn
elsewhither
But
fear
your
voice
has
lost
its
charm
The
Riders
gazed
Théoden
like
men
startled
out
dream
Harsh
old
raven
their
master
voice
sounded
their
ears
after
the
music
Saruman
But
Saruman
for
while
was
beside
himself
with
wrath
leaned
over
the
rail
would
smite
the
King
with
his
staff
some
suddenly
seemed
that
they
saw
snake
coiling
itself
strike
Gibbets
and
crows
hissed
and
they
shuddered
the
hideous
change
Dotard
What
the
house
Eorl
but
thatched
barn
where
brigands
drink
the
reek
and
their
brats
roll
the
floor
among
the
dogs
Too
long
have
they
escaped
the
gibbet
themselves
But
the
noose
comes
slow
the
drawing
tight
and
hard
the
end
Hang
you
will
Now
his
voice
changed
slowly
mastered
himself
know
not
why
have
had
the
patience
speak
you
For
need
you
not
nor
your
little
band
gallopers
swift
fly
advance
Théoden
Horsemaster
Long
ago
offered
you
state
beyond
your
merit
and
your
wit
have
offered
again
that
those
whom
you
mislead
may
clearly
see
the
choice
roads
You
give
brag
and
abuse
back
your
huts
But
you
Gandalf
For
you
least
grieved
feeling
for
your
shame
How
comes
that
you
can
endure
such
company
For
you
are
proud
Gandalf
and
not
without
reason
having
noble
mind
and
eyes
that
look
both
deep
and
far
Even
now
will
you
not
listen
counsel
Gandalf
stirred
and
looked
What
have
you
say
that
you
did
not
say
our
last
meeting
asked
perhaps
you
have
things
unsay
Saruman
paused
Unsay
mused
puzzled
Unsay
endeavoured
advise
you
for
your
own
good
but
you
scarcely
listened
You
are
proud
and
not
love
advice
having
indeed
store
your
own
wisdom
But
that
occasion
you
erred
think
misconstruing
intentions
wilfully
fear
that
eagerness
persuade
you
lost
patience
And
indeed
regret
For
bore
you
ill
will
and
even
now
bear
none
though
you
return
the
company
the
violent
and
the
ignorant
How
should
Are
not
both
members
high
and
ancient
order
most
excellent
Middle
earth
Our
friendship
would
profit
both
alike
Much
could
still
accomplish
together
heal
the
disorders
the
world
Let
understand
one
another
and
dismiss
from
thought
these
lesser
folk
Let
them
wait
our
decisions
For
the
common
good
willing
redress
the
past
and
receive
you
Will
you
not
consult
with
Will
you
not
come
great
was
the
power
that
Saruman
exerted
this
last
effort
that
none
that
stood
within
hearing
were
unmoved
But
now
the
spell
was
wholly
different
They
heard
the
gentle
remonstrance
kindly
king
with
erring
but
much
loved
minister
But
they
were
shut
out
listening
door
words
not
meant
for
them
ill
mannered
children
stupid
servants
overhearing
the
elusive
discourse
their
elders
and
wondering
how
would
affect
their
lot
loftier
mould
these
two
were
made
reverend
and
wise
was
inevitable
that
they
should
make
alliance
Gandalf
would
ascend
into
the
tower
discuss
deep
things
beyond
their
comprehension
the
high
chambers
Orthanc
The
door
would
closed
and
they
would
left
outside
dismissed
await
allotted
work
punishment
Even
the
mind
Théoden
the
thought
took
shape
like
shadow
doubt
will
betray
will
shall
lost
Then
Gandalf
laughed
The
fantasy
vanished
like
puff
smoke
Saruman
Saruman
said
Gandalf
still
laughing
Saruman
you
missed
your
path
life
You
should
have
been
the
king
jester
and
earned
your
bread
and
stripes
too
mimicking
his
counsellors
paused
getting
the
better
his
mirth
Understand
one
another
fear
beyond
your
comprehension
But
you
Saruman
understand
now
too
well
keep
clearer
memory
your
arguments
and
deeds
than
you
suppose
When
last
visited
you
you
were
the
jailor
Mordor
and
there
was
sent
Nay
the
guest
who
has
escaped
from
the
roof
will
think
twice
before
comes
back
the
door
Nay
not
think
will
come
But
listen
Saruman
for
the
last
time
Will
you
not
come
down
Isengard
has
proved
less
strong
than
your
hope
and
fancy
made
may
other
things
which
you
still
have
trust
Would
not
well
leave
for
while
turn
new
things
perhaps
Think
well
Saruman
Will
you
not
come
down
shadow
passed
over
Saruman
face
then
went
deathly
white
Before
could
conceal
they
saw
through
the
mask
the
anguish
mind
doubt
loathing
stay
and
dreading
leave
its
refuge
For
second
hesitated
and
one
breathed
Then
spoke
and
his
voice
was
shrill
and
cold
Pride
and
hate
were
conquering
him
Will
come
down
mocked
Does
unarmed
man
come
down
speak
with
robbers
out
doors
can
hear
you
ell
enough
here
fool
and
not
trust
you
Gandalf
They
not
stand
openly
stairs
but
know
where
the
wild
wood
demons
are
lurking
your
command
The
treacherous
are
ever
distrustful
answered
Gandalf
wearily
But
you
need
not
fear
for
your
skin
not
wish
kill
you
hurt
you
you
would
know
you
really
understood
And
have
the
power
protect
you
giving
you
last
chance
You
can
leave
Orthanc
free
you
choose
That
sounds
well
sneered
Saruman
Very
much
the
manner
Gandalf
the
Grey
condescending
and
very
kind
not
doubt
that
you
would
find
Orthanc
commodious
and
departure
convenient
But
why
should
wish
leave
And
what
you
mean
free
There
are
conditions
presume
Reasons
for
leaving
you
can
see
from
your
windows
answered
Gandalf
Others
will
occur
your
thought
Your
servants
are
destroyed
and
scattered
your
neighbours
you
have
made
your
enemies
and
you
have
cheated
your
new
master
tried
When
his
eye
turns
hither
will
the
red
eye
wrath
But
when
say
free
mean
free
free
from
bond
chain
command
where
you
will
even
even
Mordor
Saruman
you
desire
But
you
will
first
surrender
the
Key
Orthanc
and
your
staff
They
shall
pledges
your
conduct
returned
later
you
merit
them
Saruman
face
grew
livid
twisted
with
rage
and
red
light
was
kindled
his
eyes
laughed
wildly
Later
cried
and
his
voice
rose
scream
Later
Yes
when
you
also
have
the
Keys
Barad
dûr
itself
suppose
and
the
crowns
seven
kings
and
the
rods
the
Five
Wizards
and
have
purchased
yourself
pair
boots
many
sizes
larger
than
those
that
you
wear
now
modest
plan
Hardly
one
which
help
needed
have
other
things
not
fool
you
wish
treat
with
while
you
have
chance
away
and
come
back
when
you
are
sober
And
leave
behind
these
cut
throats
and
small
rag
tag
that
dangle
your
tail
Good
day
turned
and
left
the
balcony
Come
back
Saruman
said
Gandalf
commanding
voice
the
amazement
the
others
Saruman
turned
again
and
dragged
against
his
will
came
slowly
back
the
iron
rail
leaning
breathing
hard
His
face
was
lined
and
shrunken
His
hand
clutched
his
heavy
black
staff
like
claw
did
not
give
you
leave
said
Gandalf
sternly
have
not
finished
You
have
become
fool
Saruman
and
yet
pitiable
You
might
still
have
turned
away
from
folly
and
evil
and
have
been
service
But
you
choose
stay
and
gnaw
the
ends
your
old
plots
Stay
then
But
warn
you
you
will
not
easily
come
out
again
Not
unless
the
dark
hands
the
East
stretch
out
take
you
Saruman
cried
and
his
voice
grew
power
and
authority
Behold
not
Gandalf
the
Grey
whom
you
betrayed
Gandalf
the
White
who
has
returned
from
death
You
have
colour
now
and
cast
you
from
the
order
and
from
the
Council
raised
his
hand
and
spoke
slowly
clear
cold
voice
Saruman
your
staff
broken
There
was
crack
and
the
staff
split
asunder
Saruman
hand
and
the
head
fell
down
Gandalf
feet
said
Gandalf
With
cry
Saruman
fell
back
and
crawled
away
that
moment
heavy
shining
thing
came
hurtling
down
from
above
glanced
off
the
iron
rail
even
Saruman
left
and
passing
close
Gandalf
head
smote
the
stair
which
stood
The
rail
rang
and
snapped
The
stair
cracked
and
splintered
glittering
sparks
But
the
ball
was
unharmed
rolled
down
the
steps
globe
crystal
dark
but
glowing
with
heart
fire
bounded
away
towards
pool
Pippin
ran
after
and
picked
The
murderous
rogue
cried
Éomer
But
Gandalf
was
unmoved
that
was
not
thrown
Saruman
said
nor
even
his
bidding
think
came
from
window
far
above
parting
shot
from
Master
Wormtongue
fancy
but
ill
aimed
The
aim
was
poor
maybe
because
could
not
make
his
mind
which
hated
more
you
Saruman
said
Aragorn
That
may
said
Gandalf
Small
comfort
will
those
two
have
their
companionship
they
will
gnaw
one
another
with
words
But
the
punishment
just
Wormtongue
ever
comes
out
Orthanc
alive
will
more
than
deserves
Here
lad
take
that
did
not
ask
you
handle
cried
turning
sharply
and
seeing
Pippin
coming
the
steps
slowly
were
bearing
great
weight
went
down
meet
him
and
hastily
took
the
dark
globe
from
the
hobbit
wrapping
the
folds
his
cloak
will
take
care
this
said
not
thing
guess
that
Saruman
would
have
chosen
cast
away
But
may
have
other
things
cast
said
Gimli
that
the
end
the
debate
let
out
stone
throw
least
the
end
said
Gandalf
Let
They
turned
their
backs
the
doors
Orthanc
and
went
down
The
riders
hailed
the
king
with
joy
and
saluted
Gandalf
The
spell
Saruman
was
broken
they
had
seen
him
come
call
and
crawl
away
dismissed
Well
that
done
said
Gandalf
Now
must
find
Treebeard
and
tell
him
how
things
have
gone
will
have
guessed
surely
said
Merry
Were
they
likely
end
any
other
way
Not
likely
answered
Gandalf
though
they
came
the
balance
hair
But
had
reasons
for
trying
some
merciful
and
some
less
First
Saruman
was
shown
that
the
power
his
voice
was
waning
cannot
both
tyrant
and
counsellor
When
the
plot
ripe
remains
longer
secret
Yet
fell
into
the
trap
and
tried
deal
with
his
victims
piece
meal
while
others
listened
Then
gave
him
last
choice
and
fair
one
renounce
both
Mordor
and
his
private
schemes
and
make
amends
helping
our
need
knows
our
need
none
better
Great
service
could
have
rendered
But
has
chosen
withhold
and
keep
the
power
Orthanc
will
not
serve
only
command
lives
now
terror
the
shadow
Mordor
and
yet
still
dreams
riding
the
storm
Unhappy
fool
will
devoured
the
power
the
East
stretches
out
its
arms
Isengard
cannot
destroy
Orthanc
from
without
but
Sauron
who
knows
what
can
And
what
Sauron
does
not
conquer
What
will
you
him
asked
Pippin
Nothing
said
Gandalf
will
nothing
him
not
wish
for
mastery
What
ill
become
him
cannot
say
grieve
that
much
that
was
good
now
festers
the
tower
Still
for
things
have
not
gone
badly
Strange
are
the
turns
fortune
Often
does
hatred
hurt
itself
guess
that
even
had
entered
could
have
found
few
treasures
Orthanc
more
precious
than
the
thing
which
Wormtongue
threw
down
shrill
shriek
suddenly
cut
off
came
from
open
window
high
above
seems
that
Saruman
thinks
too
said
Gandalf
Let
leave
them
They
returned
now
the
ruins
the
gate
Hardly
had
they
passed
out
under
the
arch
when
from
among
the
shadows
the
piled
stones
where
they
had
stood
Treebeard
and
dozen
other
Ents
came
striding
Aragorn
Gimli
and
Legolas
gazed
them
wonder
Here
are
three
companions
Treebeard
said
Gandalf
have
spoken
them
but
you
have
not
yet
seen
them
named
them
one
one
The
Old
Ent
looked
them
long
and
searchingly
and
spoke
them
turn
Last
turned
Legolas
you
have
come
all
the
way
from
Mirkwood
good
Elf
very
great
forest
used
And
still
said
Legolas
But
not
great
that
who
dwell
there
ever
tire
seeing
new
trees
should
dearly
love
journey
Fangorn
Wood
scarcely
passed
beyond
the
eaves
and
did
not
wish
turn
back
Treebeard
eyes
gleamed
with
pleasure
hope
you
may
have
your
wish
ere
the
hills
much
older
said
will
come
have
the
fortune
said
Legolas
have
made
bargain
with
friend
that
all
goes
well
will
visit
Fangorn
together
your
leave
Any
Elf
that
comes
with
you
will
welcome
said
Treebeard
The
friend
speak
not
Elf
said
Legolas
mean
Gimli
Glóin
son
here
Gimli
bowed
low
and
the
axe
slipped
from
his
belt
and
clattered
the
ground
Hoom
now
said
Treebeard
looking
dark
eyed
him
dwarf
and
axe
bearer
Hoom
have
good
will
Elves
but
you
ask
much
This
strange
friendship
Strange
may
seem
said
Legolas
but
while
Gimli
lives
shall
not
come
Fangorn
alone
His
axe
not
for
trees
but
for
orc
necks
Fangorn
Master
Fangorn
Wood
Forty
two
hewed
the
battle
Hoo
Come
now
said
Treebeard
That
better
story
Well
well
things
will
they
will
and
there
need
hurry
meet
them
But
now
must
part
for
while
Day
drawing
end
yet
Gandalf
says
you
must
ere
nightfall
and
the
Lord
the
Mark
eager
for
his
own
house
Yes
must
and
now
said
Gandalf
fear
that
must
take
your
gatekeepers
from
you
But
you
will
manage
well
enough
without
them
Maybe
shall
said
Treebeard
But
shall
miss
them
have
become
friends
short
while
that
think
must
getting
hasty
growing
backwards
towards
youth
perhaps
But
there
they
are
the
first
new
thing
under
Sun
Moon
that
have
seen
for
many
long
long
day
shall
not
forget
them
have
put
their
names
into
the
Long
List
Ents
will
remember
_Ents
the
earthborn
old
mountains
the
wide
walkers
water
drinking
and
hungry
hunters
the
Hobbit
children
the
laughing
folk
the
little
people
they
shall
remain
friends
long
leaves
are
renewed
Fare
you
well
But
you
hear
news
your
pleasant
land
the
Shire
send
word
You
know
what
mean
word
sight
the
Entwives
Come
yourselves
you
can
will
said
Merry
and
Pippin
together
and
they
turned
away
hastily
Treebeard
looked
them
and
was
silent
for
while
shaking
his
head
thoughtfully
Then
turned
Gandalf
Saruman
would
not
leave
said
did
not
think
would
His
heart
rotten
black
Huorn
Still
were
overcome
and
all
trees
destroyed
would
not
come
while
had
one
dark
hole
left
hide
said
Gandalf
But
you
have
not
plotted
cover
all
the
world
with
your
trees
and
choke
all
other
living
things
But
there
Saruman
remains
nurse
his
hatred
and
weave
again
such
webs
can
has
the
Key
Orthanc
But
must
not
allowed
escape
Indeed
Ents
will
see
that
said
Treebeard
Saruman
shall
not
set
foot
beyond
the
rock
without
leave
Ents
will
watch
over
him
Good
said
Gandalf
That
what
hoped
Now
can
and
turn
other
matters
with
one
care
the
less
But
you
must
wary
The
waters
have
gone
down
will
not
enough
put
sentinels
round
the
tower
fear
not
doubt
that
there
were
deep
ways
delved
under
Orthanc
and
that
Saruman
hopes
and
come
unmarked
before
long
you
will
undertake
the
labour
beg
you
pour
the
waters
again
and
until
Isengard
remains
standing
pool
you
discover
the
outlets
When
all
the
underground
places
are
drowned
and
the
outlets
blocked
then
Saruman
must
stay
upstairs
and
look
out
the
windows
Leave
the
Ents
said
Treebeard
shall
search
the
valley
from
head
foot
and
peer
under
every
pebble
Trees
are
coming
back
live
here
old
trees
wild
trees
The
Watchwood
will
call
Not
squirrel
will
here
but
shall
know
Leave
Ents
Until
seven
times
the
years
which
tormented
have
passed
shall
not
tire
watching

_Chapter
11_
The
Palantír
The
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
long
western
arm
the
mountains
when
Gandalf
and
his
companions
and
the
king
with
his
Riders
set
out
again
from
Isengard
Gandalf
took
Merry
behind
him
and
Aragorn
took
Pippin
Two
the
king
men
went
ahead
riding
swiftly
and
passed
soon
out
sight
down
into
the
valley
The
others
followed
easy
pace
Ents
solemn
row
stood
like
statues
the
gate
with
their
long
arms
uplifted
but
they
made
sound
Merry
and
Pippin
looked
back
when
they
had
passed
some
way
down
the
winding
road
Sunlight
was
still
shining
the
sky
but
long
shadows
reached
over
Isengard
grey
ruins
falling
into
darkness
Treebeard
stood
alone
there
now
like
the
distant
stump
old
tree
the
hobbits
thought
their
first
meeting
upon
the
sunny
ledge
far
away
the
borders
Fangorn
They
came
the
pillar
the
White
Hand
The
pillar
was
still
standing
but
the
graven
hand
had
been
thrown
down
and
broken
into
small
pieces
Right
the
middle
the
road
the
long
forefinger
lay
white
the
dusk
its

The
Ents

attention
every
detail
said
Gandalf
They
rode
and
evening
deepened
the
valley
Are
riding
far
tonight
Gandalf
asked
Merry
after
while
don
know
how
you
feel
with
small
rag
tag
dangling
behind
you
but
the
rag
tag
tired
and
will
glad
stop
dangling
and
lie
down
you
heard
that
said
Gandalf
Don
let
rankle
thankful
longer
words
were
aimed
you
had
his
eyes
you
any
comfort
your
pride
should
say
that
the
moment
you
and
Pippin
are
more
his
thoughts
than
all
the
rest
Who
you
are
how
you
came
there
and
why
what
you
know
whether
you
were
captured
and
how
you
escaped
when
all
the
Orcs
perished
with
those
little
riddles
that
the
great
mind
Saruman
troubled
sneer
from
him
Meriadoc
compliment
you
feel
honoured
his
concern
Thank
you
said
Merry
But
greater
honour
dangle
your
tail
Gandalf
For
one
thing
that
position
one
has
chance
putting
question
second
time
Are
riding
far
tonight
Gandalf
laughed
most
unquenchable
hobbit
All
Wizards
should
have
hobbit
two
their
care
teach
them
the
meaning
the
word
and
correct
them
beg
your
pardon
But
have
given
thought
even
these
simple
matters
will
ride
for
few
hours
gently
until
come
the
end
the
valley
Tomorrow
must
ride
faster
When
came
meant
straight
from
Isengard
back
the
king
house
Edoras
over
the
plains
ride
some
days
But
have
taken
thought
and
changed
the
plan
Messengers
have
gone
ahead
Helm
Deep
warn
them
that
the
king
returning
tomorrow
will
ride
from
there
with
many
men
Dunharrow
paths
among
the
hills
From
now
more
than
two
three
together
are
openly
over
the
land
day
night
when
can
avoided
Nothing
double
helping
your
way
said
Merry
afraid
was
not
looking
beyond
tonight
bed
Where
and
what
are
Helm
Deep
and
all
the
rest
don
know
anything
about
this
country
Then
you
best
learn
something
you
wish
understand
what
happening
But
not
just
now
and
not
from
have
too
many
pressing
things
think
about
All
right
tackle
Strider
the
camp
fire
less
testy
But
why
all
this
secrecy
thought
won
the
battle
Yes
have
won
but
only
the
first
victor
and
that
itself
increases
our
danger
There
was
some
link
between
Isengard
and
Mordor
which
have
not
yet
fathomed
How
they
exchanged
news
not
sure
but
they
did
The
Eye
Barad
dûr
will
looking
impatiently
towards
the
Wizard
Vale
think
and
towards
Rohan
The
less
sees
the
better
The
road
passed
slowly
winding
down
the
valley
Now
further
and
now
nearer
Isen
flowed
its
stony
bed
Night
came
down
from
the
mountains
All
the
mists
were
gone
chill
wind
blew
The
moon
now
waxing
round
filled
the
eastern
sky
with
pale
cold
sheen
The
shoulders
the
mountain
their
right
sloped
down
bare
hills
The
wide
plains
opened
grey
before
them
last
they
halted
Then
they
turned
aside
leaving
the
highway
and
taking
the
sweet
upland
turf
again
Going
westward
mile
they
came
dale
opened
southward
leaning
back
into
the
slope
round
Dol
Baran
the
last
hill
the
northern
ranges
greenfooted
crowned
with
heather
The
sides
the
glen
were
shaggy
with
last
year
bracken
among
which
the
tight
curled
fronds
spring
were
just
thrusting
through
the
sweet
scented
earth
Thornbushes
grew
thick
upon
the
low
banks
and
under
them
they
made
their
camp
two
hours
before
the
middle
the
night
They
lit
fire
hollow
down
among
the
roots
spreading
hawthorn
tall
tree
writhen
with
age
but
hale
every
limb
Buds
were
swelling
each
twig
tip
Guards
were
set
two
watch
The
rest
after
they
had
supped
wrapped
themselves
cloak
and
blanket
and
slept
The
hobbits
lay
corner
themselves
upon
pile
old
bracken
Merry
was
sleepy
but
Pippin
now
seemed
curiously
restless
The
bracken
cracked
and
rustled
twisted
and
turned
What
the
matter
asked
Merry
Are
you
lying
ant
hill
said
Pippin
but
not
comfortable
wonder
how
long
since
slept
bed
Merry
yawned
Work
out
your
fingers
said
But
you
must
know
how
long
since
left
Lórien
that
said
Pippin
mean
real
bed
bedroom
Well
Rivendell
then
said
Merry
But
could
sleep
anywhere
tonight
You
had
the
luck
Merry
said
Pippin
softly
after
long
pause
You
were
riding
with
Gandalf
Well
what
Did
you
get
any
news
any
information
out
him
Yes
good
deal
More
than
usual
But
you
heard
all
most
you
were
close
and
were
talking
secrets
But
you
can
with
him
tomorrow
you
think
you
can
get
more
out
him
and
have
you
Can
Good
But
close
isn
Not
changed
all
yes
said
Merry
waking
little
and
beginning
wonder
what
was
bothering
his
companion
has
grown
something
can
both
kinder
and
more
alarming
merrier
and
more
solemn
than
before
think
has
changed
but
have
not
had
chance
see
how
much
yet
But
think
the
last
part
that
business
with
Saruman
Remember
Saruman
was
once
Gandalf
superior
head
the
Council
whatever
that
may
exactly
was
Saruman
the
White
Gandalf
the
White
now
Saruman
came
when
was
told
and
his
rod
was
taken
and
then
was
just
told
and
went
Well
Gandalf
has
changed
all
then
closer
than
ever
that
all
Pippin
argued
That
glass
ball
now
seemed
mighty
pleased
with
knows
guesses
something
about
But
does
tell
what
not
word
Yet
picked
and
saved
from
rolling
into
pool
_Here
take
that
lad_
that
all
wonder
what
felt
very
heavy
Pippin
voice
fell
very
low
was
talking
himself
Hullo
said
Merry
that
what
bothering
you
Now
Pippin
lad
don
forget
Gildor
saying
the
one
Sam
used
quote
not
meddle
the
Fairs
Wizards
for
they
are
subtle
and
quick
anger_
But
our
whole
life
for
months
has
been
one
long
meddling
the
affairs
Wizards
said
Pippin
should
like
bit
information
well
danger
should
like
look
that
ball
sleep
said
Merry
You
get
information
enough
sooner
later
dear
Pippin
Took
ever
beat
Brandybuck
for
inquisitiveness
but
this
the
time
ask
you
All
right
What
the
harm
telling
you
what
should
like
look
that
stone
know
can
have
with
old
Gandalf
sitting
like
hen
egg
But
doesn
help
much
get
more
from
you
than
_you
can
have
sleep_
Well
what
else
could
say
said
Merry
sorry
Pippin
but
you
really
must
wait
till
the
morning
curious
you
like
after
breakfast
and
help
any
way
can
wizard
wheedling
But
can
keep
awake
any
longer
yawn
any
more
shall
split
the
ears
Good
night
Pippin
said
more
lay
still
now
but
sleep
remained
far
away
and
was
not
encouraged
the
sound
Merry
breathing
softly
asleep
few
minutes
after
saying
good
night
The
thought
the
dark
globe
seemed
grow
stronger
all
grew
quiet
Pippin
felt
again
its
weight
his
hands
and
saw
again
the
mysterious
red
depths
into
which
had
looked
for
moment
tossed
and
turned
and
tried
think
something
else
last
could
stand
longer
got
and
looked
round
was
chilly
and
wrapped
his
cloak
about
him
The
moon
was
shining
cold
and
white
down
into
the
dell
and
the
shadows
the
bushes
were
black
All
about
lay
sleeping
shapes
The
two
guards
were
not
view
they
were
the
hill
perhaps
hidden
the
bracken
Driven
some
impulse
that
did
not
understand
Pippin
walked
softly
where
Gandalf
lay
looked
down
him
The
wizard
seemed
asleep
but
with
lids
not
fully
closed
there
was
glitter
eyes
under
his
long
lashes
Pippin
stepped
back
hastily
But
Gandalf
made
sign
and
drawn
forward
once
more
half
against
his
will
the
hobbit
crept
again
from
behind
the
wizard
head
was
rolled
blanket
with
his
cloak
spread
over
the
top
and
close
beside
him
between
his
right
side
and
his
bent
arm
there
was
hummock
something
round
wrapped
dark
cloth
his
hand
seemed
only
just
have
slipped
off
the
ground
Hardly
breathing
Pippin
crept
nearer
foot
foot
last
knelt
down
Then
put
his
hands
out
stealthily
and
slowly
lifted
the
lump
did
not
seem
quite
heavy
had
expected
Only
some
bundle
oddments
perhaps
after
all
thought
with
strange
sense
relief
but
did
not
put
the
bundle
down
again
stood
for
moment
clasping
Then
idea
came
into
his
mind
tiptoed
away
found
large
stone
and
came
back
Quickly
now
drew
off
the
cloth
wrapped
the
stone
and
kneeling
down
laid
back
the
wizard
hand
Then
last
looked
the
thing
that
had
uncovered
There
was
smooth
globe
crystal
now
dark
and
dead
lying
bare
before
his
knees
Pippin
lifted
covered
hurriedly
his
own
cloak
and
half
turned
back
his
bed
that
moment
Gandalf
moved
his
sleep
and
muttered
some
words
they
seemed
strange
tongue
his
hand
groped
out
and
clasped
the
wrapped
stone
then
sighed
and
did
not
move
again
You
idiotic
fool
Pippin
muttered
himself
You
going
get
yourself
into
frightful
trouble
Put
back
quick
But
found
now
that
his
knees
quaked
and
did
not
dare
near
enough
the
wizard
reach
the
bundle
never
get
back
now
without
waking
him
thought
not
till
bit
calmer
may
well
have
look
first
Not
just
here
though
stole
away
and
sat
down
green
hillock
not
far
from
his
bed
The
moon
looked
over
the
edge
the
dell
Pippin
sat
with
his
knees
drawn
and
the
ball
between
them
bent
low
over
looking
like
greedy
child
stooping
over
bowl
food
corner
away
from
others
drew
his
cloak
aside
and
gazed
The
air
seemed
still
and
tense
about
him
first
the
globe
was
dark
black
jet
with
the
moonlight
gleaming
its
surface
Then
there
came
faint
glow
and
stir
the
heart
and
held
his
eyes
that
now
could
not
look
away
Soon
all
the
inside
seemed
fire
the
ball
was
spinning
the
lights
within
were
revolving
Suddenly
the
lights
went
out
gave
gasp
and
struggled
but
remained
bent
clasping
the
ball
with
both
hands
Closer
and
closer
bent
and
then
became
rigid
his
lips
moved
soundlessly
for
while
Then
with
strangled
cry
fell
back
and
lay
still
The
cry
was
piercing
The
guards
leapt
down
from
the
banks
All
the
camp
was
soon
astir
this
the
thief
said
Gandalf
Hastily
cast
his
cloak
over
the
globe
where
lay
But
you
Pippin
This
grievous
turn
things
knelt
Pippin
body
the
hobbit
was
lying
his
back
rigid
with
unseeing
eyes
staring
the
sky
The
devilry
What
mischief
has
done
himself
and
all
The
wizard
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
took
Pippin
hand
and
bent
over
his
face
listening
for
his
breath
then
laid
his
hands
his
brow
The
hobbit
shuddered
His
eyes
closed
cried
out
and
sat
staring
bewilderment
all
the
faces
round
him
pale
the
moonlight
not
for
you
Saruman
cried
shrill
and
toneless
voice
shrinking
away
from
Gandalf
will
send
for
once
you
understand
Say
just
that
Then
struggled
get
and
escape
but
Gandalf
held
him
gently
and
firmly
Peregrin
Took
said
Come
back
The
hobbit
relaxed
and
fell
back
clinging
the
wizard
hand
Gandalf
cried
Gandalf
Forgive
Forgive
you
said
the
wizard
Tell
first
what
you
have
done
took
the
ball
and
looked
stammered
Pippin
and
saw
things
that
frightened
And
wanted
away
but
couldn
And
then
came
and
questioned
and
looked
and
and
that
all
remember
That
won
said
Gandalf
sternly
What
did
you
see
and
what
did
you
say
Pippin
shut
his
eyes
and
shivered
but
said
nothing
They
all
stared
him
silence
except
Merry
who
turned
away
But
Gandalf
face
was
still
hard
Speak
said
low
hesitating
voice
Pippin
began
again
and
slowly
his
words
grew
clearer
and
stronger
saw
dark
sky
and
tall
battlements
said
And
tiny
stars
seemed
very
far
away
and
long
ago
yet
hard
and
clear
Then
the
stars
went
and
out
they
were
cut
off
things
with
wings
Very
big
think
really
but
the
glass
they
looked
like
bats
wheeling
round
the
tower
thought
there
were
nine
them
One
began
fly
straight
towards
getting
bigger
and
bigger
had
horrible
can
say
tried
get
away
because
thought
would
fly
out
but
when
had
covered
all
the
globe
disappeared
Then
_he_
came
did
not
speak
that
could
hear
words
just
looked
and
understood
you
have
come
back
Why
have
you
neglected
report
for
long
did
not
answer
said
Who
are
you
still
did
not
answer
but
hurt
horribly
and
pressed
said
hobbit
Then
suddenly
seemed
see
and
laughed
was
cruel
was
like
being
stabbed
with
knives
struggled
But
said
Wait
moment
shall
meet
again
soon
Tell
Saruman
that
this
dainty
not
for
him
will
send
for
once
you
understand
Say
just
that
Then
gloated
over
felt
was
falling
pieces
can
say
any
more
don
remember
anything
else
Look
said
Gandalf
Pippin
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
The
wizard
held
his
gaze
for
moment
silence
Then
his
face
grew
gentler
and
the
shadow
smile
appeared
laid
his
hand
softly
Pippin
head
All
right
said
Say
more
You
have
taken
harm
There
lie
your
eyes
feared
But
did
not
speak
long
with
you
fool
but
honest
fool
you
remain
Peregrin
Took
Wiser
ones
might
have
done
worse
such
pass
But
mark
this
You
have
been
saved
and
all
your
friends
too
mainly
good
fortune
called
You
cannot
count
second
time
had
questioned
you
then
and
there
almost
certainly
you
would
have
told
all
that
you
know
the
ruin
all
But
was
too
eager
did
not
want
information
only
wanted
you
quickly
that
could
deal
with
you
the
Dark
Tower
slowly
Don
shudder
you
will
meddle
the
affairs
Wizards
you
must
prepared
think
such
things
But
come
forgive
you
comforted
Things
have
not
turned
out
evilly
they
might
lifted
Pippin
gently
and
carried
him
back
his
bed
Merry
followed
and
sat
down
beside
him
Lie
there
and
rest
you
can
Pippin
said
Gandalf
Trust
you
feel
itch
your
palms
again
tell
Such
things
can
cured
But
anyway
dear
hobbit
don
put
lump
rock
under
elbow
again
Now
will
leave
you
two
together
for
while
With
that
Gandalf
returned
the
others
who
were
still
standing
the
Orthanc
stone
troubled
thought
Peril
comes
the
night
when
least
expected
said
have
had
narrow
escape
How
the
hobbit
Pippin
asked
Aragorn
think
all
will
well
now
answered
Gandalf
was
not
held
long
and
hobbits
have
amazing
power
recovery
The
memory
the
horror
will
probably
fade
quickly
Too
quickly
perhaps
Will
you
Aragorn
take
the
Orthanc
stone
and
guard
dangerous
charge
Dangerous
indeed
but
not
all
said
Aragorn
There
one
who
may
claim
right
For
this
assuredly
the
_palantír_
Orthanc
from
the
treasury
Elendil
set
here
the
Kings
Gondor
Now
hour
draws
near
will
take
Gandalf
looked
Aragorn
and
then
the
surprise
the
others
lifted
the
covered
Stone
and
bowed
presented
Receive
lord
said
earnest
other
things
that
shall
given
back
But
may
counsel
you
the
use
your
own
not
use
yet
wary
When
have
been
hasty
unwary
who
have
waited
and
prepared
for
many
long
years
said
Aragorn
Never
yet
not
then
stumble
the
end
the
road
answered
Gandalf
But
the
least
keep
this
thing
secret
You
and
all
others
that
stand
here
The
hobbit
Peregrin
above
all
should
not
know
where
bestowed
The
evil
fit
may
come
him
again
For
alas
has
handled
and
looked
should
never
have
happened
ought
never
have
touched
Isengard
and
there
should
have
been
quicker
But
mind
was
bent
Saruman
and
did
not
once
guess
the
nature
the
Stone
Then
was
weary
and
lay
pondering
sleep
overcame
Now
know
Yes
there
can
doubt
said
Aragorn
last
know
the
link
between
Isengard
and
Mordor
and
how
worked
Much
explained
Strange
powers
have
our
enemies
and
strange
weaknesses
said
Théoden
But
has
long
been
said
_oft
evil
will
shall
evil
mar_
That
many
times
seen
said
Gandalf
But
this
time
have
been
strangely
fortunate
Maybe
have
been
saved
this
hobbit
from
grave
blunder
had
considered
whether
not
probe
this
Stone
myself
find
its
uses
Had
done
should
have
been
revealed
him
myself
not
ready
for
such
trial
indeed
shall
ever
But
even
found
the
power
withdraw
myself
would
disastrous
for
him
see
yet
until
the
hour
comes
when
secrecy
will
avail
longer
That
hour
now
come
think
said
Aragorn
Not
yet
said
Gandalf
There
remains
short
while
doubt
which
must
use
The
Enemy
clear
thought
that
the
Stone
was
Orthanc
why
should
not
And
that
therefore
the
hobbit
was

there
driven
look
the
glass
for
his
torment
Saruman
That
dark
mind
will
filled
now
with
the
voice
and
face
the
hobbit
and
with
expectation
may
take
some
time
before
learns
his
error
must
snatch
that
time
have
been
too
leisurely
must
move
The
neighbourhood
Isengard
place
now
linger
will
ride
ahead
once
with
Peregrin
Took
will
better
for
him
than
lying
the
dark
while
others
sleep
will
keep
Éomer
and
ten
Riders
said
the
king
They
shall
ride
with
early
day
The
rest
may
with
Aragorn
and
ride
soon
they
have
mind
you
will
said
Gandalf
But
make
all
the
speed
you
may
the
cover
the
hills
Helm
Deep
that
moment
shadow
fell
over
them
The
bright
moonlight
seemed
suddenly
cut
off
Several
the
Riders
cried
out
and
crouched
holding
their
arms
above
their
heads
ward
off
blow
from
above
blind
fear
and
deadly
cold
fell
them
Cowering
they
looked
vast
winged
shape
passed
over
the
moon
like
black
cloud
wheeled
and
went
north
flying
speed
greater
than
any
wind
Middle
earth
The
stars
fainted
before
was
gone
They
stood
rigid
stones
Gandalf
was
gazing
his
arms
out
and
downwards
stiff
his
hands
clenched
Nazgûl
cried
The
messenger
Mordor
The
storm
coming
The
Nazgûl
have
crossed
the
River
Ride
ride
Wait
not
for
the
dawn
Let
not
the
swift
wait
for
the
slow
Ride
sprang
away
calling
Shadowfax
ran
Aragorn
followed
him
Going
Pippin
Gandalf
picked
him
his
arms
You
shall
come
with
this
time
said
Shadowfax
shall
show
you
his
paces
Then
ran
the
place
where
had
slept
Shadowfax
stood
there
already
Slinging
the
small
bag
which
was
all
his
luggage
across
his
shoulders
the
wizard
leapt
upon
the
horse
back
Aragorn
lifted
Pippin
and
set
him
Gandalf
arms
wrapped
cloak
and
blanket
Farewell
Follow
fast
cried
Gandalf
Away
Shadowfax
The
great
horse
tossed
his
head
His
flowing
tail
flicked
the
moonlight
Then
leapt
forward
spurning
the
earth
and
was
gone
like
the
north
wind
from
the
mountains
beautiful
restful
night
said
Merry
Aragorn
Some
folk
have
wonderful
luck
did
not
want
sleep
and
wanted
ride
with
Gandalf
and
there
goes
Instead
being
turned
into
stone
himself
stand
here
for
ever
warning
you
had
been
the
first
lift
the
Orthanc
stone
and
not
how
would
now
said
Aragorn
You
might
have
done
worse
Who
can
say
But
now
your
luck
come
with
fear
once
and
get
ready
and
bring
anything
that
Pippin
left
behind
Make
haste
Over
the
plains
Shadowfax
was
flying
needing
urging
and
guidance
Less
than
hour
had
passed
and
they
had
reached
the
Fords
Isen
and
crossed
them
The
Mound
the
Riders
and
its
cold
spears
lay
grey
behind
them
Pippin
was
recovering
was
warm
but
the
wind
his
face
was
keen
and
refreshing
was
with
Gandalf
The
horror
the
stone
and
the
hideous
shadow
over
the
moon
was
fading
things
left
behind
the
mists
the
mountains
passing
dream
drew
deep
breath
did
not
know
you
rode
bare
back
Gandalf
said
You
haven
saddle
bridle
not
ride
elf
fashion
except
Shadowfax
said
Gandalf
But
Shadowfax
will
have
harness
You
not
ride
Shadowfax
willing
carry
you
not
willing
that
enough
then
his
business
see
that
you
remain
his
back
unless
you
jump
off
into
the
air
How
fast
going
asked
Pippin
Fast
the
wind
but
very
smooth
And
how
light
his
footfalls
are
running
now
fast
the
swiftest
horse
could
gallop
answered
Gandalf
but
that
not
fast
for
him
The
land
rising
little
here
and
more
broken
than
was
beyond
the
river
But
see
how
the
White
Mountains
are
drawing
near
under
the
stars
Yonder
are
the
Thrihyrne
peaks
like
black
spears
will
not
long
before
reach
the
branching
roads
and
come
the
Deeping
coomb
where
the
battle
was
fought
two
nights
ago
Pippin
was
silent
again
for
while
heard
Gandalf
singing
softly
himself
murmuring
brief
snatches
rhyme
many
tongues
the
miles
ran
under
them
last
the
wizard
passed
into
song
which
the
hobbit
caught
the
words
few
lines
came
clear
his
ears
through
the
rushing
the
wind
_Tall
ships
and
tall
kings
Three
times
three
What
brought
they
from
the
foundered
land
Over
the
flowing
sea
Seven
stars
and
seven
stones
And
one
white
tree
What
are
you
saying
Gandalf
asked
Pippin
was
just
running
over
some
the
Rhymes
Lore
mind
answered
the
wizard
Hobbits
suppose
have
forgotten
them
even
those
that
they
ever
knew
not
all
said
Pippin
And
have
many
our
own
which
wouldn
interest
you
perhaps
But
have
never
heard
this
one
What
about
the
seven
stars
and
seven
stones
About
the
_palantíri_
the
Kings
Old
said
Gandalf
And
what
are
they
The
name
meant
_that
which
looks
far
away_
The
Orthanc
stone
was
one
Then
was
not
made
not
made
Pippin
hesitated
the
Enemy
said
Gandalf
Nor
Saruman
beyond
his
art
and
beyond
Sauron
too
The
_palantíri_
came
from
beyond
Westernesse
from
Eldamar
The
Noldor
made
them
Fëanor
himself
maybe
wrought
them
days
long
ago
that
the
time
cannot
measured
years
But
there
nothing
that
Sauron
cannot
turn
evil
uses
Alas
for
Saruman
was
his
downfall
now
perceive
Perilous
all
are
the
devices
art
deeper
than
possess
ourselves
Yet
must
bear
the
blame
Fool
keep
secret
for
his
own
profit
word
did
ever
speak
any
the
Council
had
not
yet
given
thought
the
fate
the
_palantíri_
Gondor
its
ruinous
wars
Men
they
were
almost
forgotten
Even
Gondor
they
were
secret
known
only
few
Arnor
they
were
remembered
only
rhyme
lore
among
the
Dúnedain
What
did
the
Men
old
use
them
for
asked
Pippin
delighted
and
astonished
getting
answers
many
questions
and
wondering
how
long
would
last
see
far
off
and
converse
thought
with
one
another
said
Gandalf
that
way
they
long
guarded
and
united
the
realm
Gondor
They
set
Stones
Minas
Anor
and
Minas
Ithil
and
Orthanc
the
ring
Isengard
The
chief
and
master
these
was
under
the
Dome
Stars
Osgiliath
before
its
ruin
The
three
others
were
far
away
the
North
the
house
Elrond
told
that
they
were
Annúminas
and
Amon
Sûl
and
Elendil
Stone
was
the
Tower
Hills
that
look
towards
Mithlond
the
Gulf
Lune
where
the
grey
ships
lie
Each
_palantír_
replied
each
but
all
those
Gondor
were
ever
open
the
view
Osgiliath
Now
appears
that
the
rock
Orthanc
has
withstood
the
storms
time
there
the
_palantír_
that
tower
has
remained
But
alone
could
nothing
but
see
small
images
things
far
off
and
days
remote
Very
useful
doubt
that
was
Saruman
yet
seems
that
was
not
content
Further
and
further
abroad
gazed
until
cast
his
gaze
upon
Barad
dûr
Then
was
caught
Who
knows
where
the
lost
Stones
Arnor
and
Gondor
now
lie
buried
drowned
deep
But
one
least
Sauron
must
have
obtained
and
mastered
his
purposes
guess
that
was
the
Ithil
stone
for
took
Minas
Ithil
long
ago
and
turned
into
evil
place
Minas
Morgul
has
become
Easy
now
guess
how
quickly
the
roving
eye
Saruman
was
trapped
and
held
and
how
ever
since
has
been
persuaded
from
afar
and
daunted
when
persuasion
would
not
serve
The
biter
bit
the
hawk
under
the
eagle
foot
the
spider
steel
web
How
long
wonder
has
been
constrained
come
often
his
glass
for
inspection
and
instruction
and
the
Orthanc
stone
bent
towards
Barad
dûr
that
any
save
will
adamant
now
looks
into
will
bear
his
mind
and
sight
swiftly
thither
And
how
draws
one
itself
Have
not
felt
Even
now
heart
desires
test
will
upon
see
could
not
wrench
from
him
and
turn
where
would
look
across
the
wide
seas
water
and
time
Tirion
the
Fair
and
perceive
the
unimaginable
hand
and
mind
Fëanor
their
work
while
both
the
White
Tree
and
the
Golden
were
flower
sighed
and
fell
silent
wish
had
known
all
this
before
said
Pippin
had
notion
what
was
doing
yes
you
had
said
Gandalf
You
knew
you
were
behaving
wrongly
and
foolishly
and
you
told
yourself
though
you
did
not
listen
did
not
tell
you
all
this
before
because
only
musing
all
that
has
happened
that
have
last
understood
even
ride
together
But
had
spoken
sooner
would
not
have
lessened
your
desire
made
easier
resist
the
contrary
the
burned
hand
teaches
best
After
that
advice
about
fire
goes
the
heart
does
said
Pippin
all
the
seven
stones
were
laid
out
before
now
should
shut
eyes
and
put
hands
pockets
Good
said
Gandalf
That
what
hoped
But
should
like
know
Pippin
began
Mercy
cried
Gandalf
the
giving
information
the
cure
your
inquisitiveness
shall
spend
all
the
rest
days
answering
you
What
more
you
want
know
The
names
all
the
stars
and
all
living
things
and
the
whole
history
Middle
earth
and
Over
heaven
and
the
Sundering
Seas
laughed
Pippin
course
What
less
But
not
hurry
tonight
the
moment
was
just
wondering
about
the
black
shadow
heard
you
shout
messenger
Mordor
What
was
What
could
Isengard
was
Black
Rider
wings
Nazgûl
said
Gandalf
could
have
taken
you
away
the
Dark
Tower
But
was
not
coming
for
was
faltered
Pippin
mean
didn
know
that
had
course
not
said
Gandalf
two
hundred
leagues
more
straight
flight
from
Barad
dûr
Orthanc
and
even
Nazgûl
would
take
few
hours
fly
between
them
But
Saruman
certainly
looked
the
Stone
since
the
orc
raid
and
more
his
secret
thought
not
doubt
has
been
read
than
intended
messenger
has
been
sent
find
out
what
doing
And
after
what
has
happened
tonight
another
will
come
think
and
swiftly
Saruman
will
come
the
last
pinch
the
vice
that
has
put
his
hand
has
captive
send
has
Stone
see
with
and
cannot
answer
the
summons
Sauron
will
only
believe
that
withholding
the
captive
and
refusing
use
the
Stone
will
not
help
Saruman
tell
the
truth
the
messenger
For
Isengard
may
ruined
yet
still
safe
Orthanc
whether
will
will
appear
rebel
Yet
rejected
avoid
that
very
thing
What
will
such
plight
cannot
guess
has
power
still
think
while
Orthanc
resist
the
Nine
Riders
may
try
may
try
trap
the
Nazgûl
least
slay
the
thing
which
now
rides
the
air
that
case
let
Rohan
look
its
horses
But
cannot
tell
how
will
fall
out
well
ill
for
may
that
the
counsels
the
Enemy
will
confused
hindered
his
wrath
with
Saruman
may
that
will
learn
that
was
there
and
stood
upon
the
stairs
Orthanc
with
hobbits
tail
that
heir
Elendil
lives
and
stood
beside
Wormtongue
was
not
deceived
the
armour
Rohan
would
remember
Aragorn
and
the
title
that
claimed
That
what

And
fly
not
from
danger
but
into
greater
danger
Every
stride
Shadowfax
bears
you
nearer
the
Land
Shadow
Peregrin
Took
Pippin
made
answer
but
clutched
his
cloak
sudden
chill
had
struck
him
Grey
land
passed
under
them
See
now
said
Gandalf
The
Westfold
dales
are
opening
before
Here
come
back
the
eastward
road
The
dark
shadow
yonder
the
mouth
the
Deeping

That
way
lies
Aglarond
and
the
Glittering
Caves
not
ask
about
them
Ask
Gimli
you
meet
again
and
for
the
first
time
you
may
get
answer
longer
than
you
wish
You
will
not
see
the
caves
yourself
not
this
journey
Soon
they
will
far
behind

you

Helm

Pippin
Where
are
you
going
then
Minas

before
the

surround
And
how
far
that
Leagues
upon
leagues
answered
Gandalf
Thrice
far
the

King
Théoden
and
they
are
more
than
hundred

east
from

the

Which
will
prove

ride
now

and
that
some

away
Then
even
Shadowfax

can
You
may
see
the

thence
you

Away

Shadowfax
Run

Now
are
come
the

where
you
were

and
every

Run
now

Shadowfax
tossed
his
head
and
cried
aloud
trumpet
had
summoned
him

Then
sprang
forward
Fire
flew
from
his
feet
night
rushed
over
him
fell
slowly
into
sleep
Pippin
had
strange
feeling
and
Gandalf
were

seated
upon

while
the

rolled
away

_Chapter
The
Taming
Sméagol
Well
master
fix
and
mistake
said
Sam
Gamgee
stood
despondently
with
hunched
shoulders
beside
Frodo
and
peered
out
with
puckered
eyes
into
the
gloom
was
the
third
evening
since
they
had
fled
from
the
Company
far
they
could
tell
they
had
almost
lost
count
the
hours
during
which
they
had
climbed
and
laboured
among
the
barren
slopes
and
stones
the
Emyn
Muil
sometimes
retracing
their
steps
because
they
could
find
way
forward
sometimes
discovering
that
they
had
wandered
circle
back
where
they
had
been
hours
before
Yet
the
whole
they
had
worked
steadily
eastward
keeping
near
they
could
find
way
the
outer
edge
this
strange
twisted
knot
hills
But
always
they
found
its
outward
faces
sheer
high
and
impassable
frowning
over
the
plain
below
beyond
its
tumbled
skirts
lay
livid
festering
marshes
where
nothing
moved
and
not
even
bird
was
seen
The
hobbits
stood
now
the
brink
tall
cliff
bare
and
bleak
its
feet
wrapped
mist
and
behind
them
rose
the
broken
highlands
crowned
with
drifting
cloud
chill
wind
blew
from
the
East
Night
was
gathering
over
the
shapeless
lands
before
them
the
sickly
green
them
was
fading
sullen
brown
Far
away
the
right
the
Anduin
that
had
gleamed
fitfully
sun
breaks
during
the
day
was
now
hidden
shadow
But
their
eyes
did
not
look
beyond
the
River
back
Gondor
their
friends
the
lands
Men
South
and
east
they
stared
where
the
edge
the
oncoming
night
dark
line
hung
like
distant
mountains
motionless
smoke
Every
now
and
again
tiny
red
gleam
far
away
flickered
upwards
the
rim
earth
and
sky
What
fix
said
Sam
That
the
one
place
all
the
lands
ever
heard
that
don
want

any
closer
and
that
the
one
place
trying
get
And
that
just
where
can
get
nohow
come
the
wrong
way
altogether
seemingly
can
get
down
and
did
get
down
find
all
that
green
land
nasty
bog
warrant
Phew
Can
you
smell
sniffed
the
wind
Yes
can
smell
said
Frodo
but
did
not
move
and
his
eyes
remained
fixed
staring
out
towards
the
dark
line
and
the
flickering
flame
Mordor
muttered
under
his
breath
must
there
wish
could
come
there
quickly
and
make
end
shuddered
The
wind
was
chilly
and
yet
heavy
with
odour
cold
decay
Well
said
last
withdrawing
his
eyes
cannot
stay
here
all
night
fix
fix

find
more
sheltered
spot
and
camp
once
more
and
perhaps
another

another

that
Shadow
yonder
that
way

But

What

had
was
speed
Delay

into
the
Enemy
hands
and
here
delayed
the
will
the
Dark
Tower
that
steers
All
choices
have
proved
ill
should
have
left
the
Company
long
before
and
come
down
from
the
North

the
River
and
the
Emyn

and
over

Battle
Plain
the

Mordor
But
now
isn
possible
for
you
and
alone

back
and
the

Every

They
turned
away
and
went
down
into
stony
hollow
The
westering
sun
was
caught
into
clouds
and
night
came
swiftly
They
slept
well
they
could
for
the
cold
turn
and
turn
about
nook
among
great
jagged
pinnacles
weathered
rock
least
they
were
sheltered
from
the
easterly
wind
Did
you
see
them
again
Frodo
asked
Sam
they
sat
stiff
and
chilled
munching
wafers
_lembas_
the
cold
grey
early
morning
said
Frodo
heard
nothing
and
seen
nothing
for
two
nights
now
Nor
said
Sam
Grrr
Those
eyes
did
give
turn
But
perhaps
shaken
him
off
last
the
miserable
slinker
Gollum
give
him
_gollum_
his
throat
ever
get
hands
his
neck
hope
you
never
need
said
Frodo
don
know
how
followed
but
may
that
lost
again
you
say
this
dry
bleak
land
can
leave
many
footprints
nor
much
scent
even
for
his
snuffling
nose
hope
that
the
way
said
Sam
wish
could
rid
him
for
good
said
Frodo
but
not
chief
trouble
wish
could
get
away
from
these
hills
hate
them
feel
all
naked
the
east
side
stuck
here
with
nothing
but
the
dead
flats
between
and
that
Shadow
yonder
There
Eye
Come
got
get
down
today
somehow
But
that
day
wore
and
when
afternoon
faded
towards
evening
they
were
still
scrambling
along
the
ridge
and
had
found
way
escape
Sometimes
the
silence
that
barren
country
they
fancied
that
they
heard
faint
sounds
behind
them
stone
falling
the
imagined
step
flapping
feet
the
rock
But
they
halted
and
stood
still
listening
they
heard
more
nothing
but
the
wind
sighing
over
the
edges
the
stones
yet
even
that
reminded
them
breath
softly
hissing
through
sharp
teeth
All
that
day
the
outer
ridge
the
Emyn
Muil
had
been
bending
gradually
northward
they
struggled
Along
its
brink
there
now
stretched
wide
tumbled
flat
scored
and
weathered
rock
cut
every
now
and
again
trench
like
gullies
that
sloped
steeply
down
deep
notches
the
cliff
face
find
path
these
clefts
which
were
becoming
deeper
and
more
frequent
Frodo
and
Sam
were
driven
their
left
well
away
from
the
edge
and
they
did
not
notice
that
for
several
miles
they
had
been
going
slowly
but
steadily
downhill
the
cliff
top
was
sinking
towards
the
level
the
lowlands
last
they
were
brought
halt
The
ridge
took
sharper
bend
northward
and
was
gashed
deeper
ravine
the
further
side
reared
again
many
fathoms
single
leap
great
grey
cliff
loomed
before
them
cut
sheer
down
knife
stroke
They
could
further
forwards
and
must
turn
now
either
west
east
But
west
would
lead
them
only
into
more
labour
and
delay
back
towards
the
heart
the
hills
east
would
take
them
the
outer
precipice
There
nothing
for
but
scramble
down
this
gully
Sam
said
Frodo
Let
see
what
leads
nasty
drop
bet
said
Sam
The
cleft
was
longer
and
deeper
than
seemed
Some
way
down
they
found
few
gnarled
and
stunted
trees
the
first
they
had
seen
for
days
twisted
birch
for
the
most
part
with
here
and
there
fir
tree
Many
were
dead
and
gaunt
bitten
the
core
the
eastern
winds
Once
milder
days
there
must
have
been
fair
thicket
the
ravine
but
now
after
some
fifty
yards
the
trees
came
end
though
old
broken
stumps
straggled
almost
the
cliff
brink
The
bottom
the
gully
which
lay
along
the
edge
rock
fault
was
rough
with
broken
stone
and
slanted
steeply
down
When
they
came
last
the
end
Frodo
stooped
and
leaned
out
Look
said
must
have
come
down
long
way
else
the
cliff
has
sunk
much
lower
here
than
was
and
looks
easier
too
Sam
knelt
beside
him
and
peered
reluctantly
over
the
edge
Then
glanced
the
great
cliff
rising
away
their
left
Easier
grunted
Well
suppose
always
easier
getting
down
than
Those
can
fly
can
jump
would
big
jump
still
said
Frodo
About
well
stood
for
moment
measuring
with
his
eyes
about
eighteen
fathoms
should
guess
Not
more
And
that
enough
said
Sam
Ugh
How
hate
looking
down
from
height
But
looking
better
than
climbing
All
the
same
said
Frodo
think
could
climb
here
and
think
shall
have
try
See
the
rock
quite
different
from
what
was
few
miles
back
has
slipped
and
cracked
The
outer
fall
was
indeed
longer
sheer
but
sloped
outwards
little
looked
like
great
rampart
sea
wall
whose
foundations
had
shifted
that
its
courses
were
all
twisted
and
disordered
leaving
great
fissures
and
long
slanting
edges
that
were
places
almost
wide
stairs
And
going
try
and
get
down
had
better
try
once
getting
dark
early
think
there
storm
coming
The
smoky
blur
the
mountains
the
East
was
lost
deeper
blackness
that
was
already
reaching
out
westwards
with
long
arms
There
was
distant
mutter
thunder
borne
the
rising
breeze
Frodo
sniffed
the
air
and
looked
doubtfully
the
sky
strapped
his
belt
outside
his
cloak
and
tightened
and
settled
his
light
pack
his
back
then
stepped
towards
the
edge
going
try
said
Very
good
said
Sam
gloomily
But
going
first
You
said
Frodo
What
made
you
change
your
mind
about
climbing
haven
changed
mind
But
only
sense
put
the
one
lowest
most
likely
slip
don
want
come
down
atop
you
and
knock
you
off
sense
killing
two
with
one
fall
Before
Frodo
could
stop
him
sat
down
swung
his
legs
over
the
brink
and
twisted
round
scrabbling
with
his
toes
for
foothold
doubtful
ever
did
anything
braver
cold
blood
more
unwise
Sam
you
old
ass
said
Frodo
You
kill
yourself
for
certain
going
over
like
that
without
even
look
see
what
make
for
Come
back
took
Sam
under
the
armpits
and
hauled
him
again
Now
wait
bit
and
patient
said
Then
lay
the
ground
leaning
out
and
looking
down
but
the
light
seemed
fading
quickly
although
the
sun
had
not
yet
set
think
could
manage
this
said
presently
could
any
rate
and
you
could
too
you
kept
your
head
and
followed
carefully
don
know
how
you
can
sure
said
Sam
Why
You
can
see
the
bottom
this
light
What
you
comes
place
where
there
nowhere
put
your
feet
your
hands
Climb
back
suppose
said
Frodo
Easy
said
objected
Sam
Better
wait
till
morning
and
more
light
Not
can
help
said
Frodo
with
sudden
strange
vehemence
grudge
every
hour
every
minute
going
down
try
out
Don
you
follow
till
come
back
call
Gripping
the
stony
lip
the
fall
with
his
fingers
let
himself
gently
down
until
when
his
arms
were
almost
full
stretch
his
toes
found
ledge
On_
step
down
said
And
this
ledge
broadens
out
the
right
could
stand
there
without
hold
his
words
were
cut
short
The
hurrying
darkness
now
gathering
great
speed
rushed
from
the
East
and
swallowed
the
sky
There
was
dry
splitting
crack
thunder
right
overhead
Searing
lightning
smote
down
into
the
hills
Then
came
blast
savage
wind
and
with
mingling
with
its
roar
there
came
high
shrill
shriek
The
hobbits
had
heard
just
such
cry
far
away
the
Marish
they
fled
from
Hobbiton
and
even
there
the
woods
the
Shire
had
frozen
their
blood
Out
here
the
waste
its
terror
was
far
greater
pierced
them
with
cold
blades
horror
and
despair
stopping
heart
and
breath
Sam
fell
flat
his
face
Involuntarily
Frodo
loosed
his
hold
and
put
his
hands
over
his
head
and
ears
swayed
slipped
and
slithered
downwards
with
wailing
cry
Sam
heard
him
and
crawled
with
effort
the
edge
Master
master
called
Master
heard
answer
found
was
shaking
all
over
but
gathered
his
breath
and
once
again
shouted
Master
The
wind
seemed
blow
his
voice
back
into
his
throat
but
passed
roaring
the
gully
and
away
over
the
hills
faint
answering
cry
came
his
ears
All
right
all
right
here
But
can
see
Frodo
was
calling
with
weak
voice
was
not
actually
very
far
away
had
slid
and
not
fallen
and
had
come
with
jolt
his
feet
wider
ledge
not
many
yards
lower
down
Fortunately
the
rock
face
this
point
leaned
well
back
and
the
wind
had
pressed
him
against
the
cliff
that
had
not
toppled
over
steadied
himself
little
laying
his
face
against
the
cold
stone
feeling
his
heart
pounding
But
either
the
darkness
had
grown
complete
else
his
eyes
had
lost
their
sight
All
was
black
about
him
wondered
had
been
struck
blind
took
deep
breath
Come
back
Come
back
heard
Sam
voice
out
the
blackness
above
can
said
can
see
can
find
any
hold
can
move
yet
What
can
Frodo
What
can
shouted
Sam
leaning
out
dangerously
far
Why
could
not
his
master
see
was
dim
certainly
but
not
dark
all
that
could
see
Frodo
below
him
grey
forlorn
figure
splayed
against
the
cliff
But
was
far
out
the
reach
any
helping
hand
There
was
another
crack
thunder
and
then
the
rain
came
blinding
sheet
mingled
with
hail
drove
against
the
cliff
bitter
cold
coming
down
you
shouted
Sam
though
how
hoped
help
that
way
could
not
have
said
wait
Frodo
called
back
more
strongly
now
shall
better
soon
feel
better
already
Wait
You
can
anything
without
rope
Rope
cried
Sam
talking
wildly
himself
his
excitement
and
relief
Well
don
deserve
hung
the
end
one
warning
numbskulls
You
nowt
but
ninnyhammer
Sam
Gamgee
that
what
the
Gaffer
said
often
enough
being
word
his
Rope
Stop
chattering
cried
Frodo
now
recovered
enough
feel
both
amused
and
annoyed
Never
mind
your
Gaffer
Are
you
trying
tell
yourself
you
got
some
rope
your
pocket
out
with
Yes
Frodo
pack
and
all
Carried
hundreds
miles
and
clean
forgotten
Then
get
busy
and
let
end
down
Quickly
Sam
unslung
his
pack
and
rummaged
There
indeed
the
bottom
was
coil
the
silken
grey
rope
made
the
folk
Lórien
cast
end
his
master
The
darkness
seemed
lift
from
Frodo
eyes
else
his
sight
was
returning
could
see
the
grey
line
came
dangling
down
and
thought
had
faint
silver
sheen
Now
that
had
some
point
the
darkness
fix
his
eyes
felt
less
giddy
Leaning
his
weight
forward
made
the
end
fast
round
his
waist
and
then
grasped
the
line
with
both
hands
Sam
stepped
back
and
braced
his
feet
against
stump
yard
two
from
the
edge
Half
hauled
half
scrambling
Frodo
came
and
threw
himself
the
ground
Thunder
growled
and
rumbled
the
distance
and
the
rain
was
still
falling
heavily
The
hobbits
crawled
away
back
into
the
gully
but
they
did
not
find
much
shelter
there
Rills
water
began
run
down
soon
they
grew
spate
that
splashed
and
fumed
the
stones
and
spouted
out
over
the
cliff
like
the
gutters
vast
roof
should
have
been
half
drowned
down
there
washed
clean
off
said
Frodo
What
piece
luck
you
had
that
rope
Better
luck
thought
sooner
said
Sam
Maybe
you
remember
them
putting
the
ropes
the
boats
started
off
the
elvish
country
took
fancy
and
stowed
coil
pack
Years
ago
seems
may
help
many
needs
said
Haldir
one
those
folk
And
spoke
right
pity
didn
think
bringing
another
length
said
Frodo
but
left
the
Company
such
hurry
and
confusion
only
had
enough
could
use
get
down
How
long
your
rope
wonder
Sam
paid
out
slowly
measuring
with
his
arms
Five
ten
twenty
thirty
ells
more
less
said
Who
have
thought
Frodo
exclaimed
Who
would
said
Sam
Elves
are
wonderful
folk
looks
bit
thin
but
tough
and
soft
milk
the
hand
Packs
close
too
and
light
light
Wonderful
folk
sure
Thirty
ells
said
Frodo
considering
believe
would
enough
the
storm
passes
before
nightfall
going
try
The
rain
nearly
given
over
already
said
Sam
but
don
you
doing
anything
risky
the
dim
again
Frodo
And
haven
got
over
that
shriek
the
wind
yet
you
have
Like
Black
Rider
sounded
but
one
the
air
they
can
fly
thinking
best
lay
this
crack
till
night
over
And
thinking
that
won
spend
moment
longer
than
need
stuck
this
edge
with
the
eyes
the
Dark
Country
looking
over
the
marshes
said
Frodo
With
that
stood
and
went
down
the
bottom
the
gully
again
looked
out
Clear
sky
was
growing
the
East
once
more
The
skirts
the
storm
were
lifting
ragged
and
wet
and
the
main
battle
had
passed
spread
its
great
wings
over
the
Emyn
Muil
upon
which
the
dark
thought
Sauron
brooded
for
while
Thence
turned
smiting
the
Vale
Anduin
with
hail
and
lightning
and
casting
its
shadow
upon
Minas
Tirith
with
threat
war
Then
lowering
the
mountains
and
gathering
its
great
spires
rolled
slowly
over
Gondor
and
the
skirts
Rohan
until
far
away
the
Riders
the
plain
saw
its
black
towers
moving
behind
the
sun
they
rode
into
the
West
But
here
over
the
desert
and
the
reeking
marshes
the
deep
blue
sky
evening
opened
once
more
and
few
pallid
stars
appeared
like
small
white
holes
the
canopy
above
the
crescent
moon
good
able
see
again
said
Frodo
breathing
deep
you
know
thought
for
bit
that
had
lost
sight
From
the
lightning
something
else
worse
could
see
nothing
nothing
all
until
the
grey
rope
came
down
seemed
shimmer
somehow
does
look
sort
silver
the
dark
said
Sam
Never
noticed
before
though
can
remember
ever
had
out
since
first
stowed
But
you
set
climbing
Frodo
how
are
you
going
use
Thirty
ells
say
about
eighteen
fathom
that
more
than
your
guess
the
height
the
cliff
Frodo
thought
for
while
Make
fast
that
stump
Sam
said
Then
think
you
shall
have
your
wish
this
time
and
first
lower
you
and
you
need
more
than
use
your
feet
and
hands
fend
yourself
off
the
rock
Though
you
put
your
weight
some
the
ledges
and
give
rest
will
help
When
you
down
follow
feel
quite
myself
again
now
Very
well
said
Sam
heavily
must
let
get
over
took
the
rope
and
made
fast
over
the
stump
nearest
the
brink
then
the
other
end
tied
about
his
own
waist
Reluctantly
turned
and
prepared
over
the
edge
second
time
did
not
however
turn
out
half
bad
had
expected
The
rope
seemed
give
him
confidence
though
shut
his
eyes
more
than
once
when
looked
down
between
his
feet
There
was
one
awkward
spot
where
there
was
ledge
and
the
wall
was
sheer
and
even
undercut
for
short
space
there
slipped
and
swung
out
the
silver
line
But
Frodo
lowered
him
slowly
and
steadily
and
was
over
last
His
chief
fear
had
been
that
the
rope
length
would
give
out
while
was
still
high
but
there
was
still
good
bight
Frodo
hands
when
Sam
came
the
bottom
and
called
down
His
voice
came
clearly
from
below
but
Frodo
could
not
see
him
his
grey
elven
cloak
had
melted
into
the
twilight
Frodo
took
rather
more
time
follow
him
had
the
rope
about
his
waist
and
was
fast
above
and
had
shortened
that
would
pull
him
before
reached
the
ground
still
did
not
want
risk
fall
and
had
not
quite
Sam
faith
this
slender
grey
line
found
two
places
all
the
same
where
had
trust
wholly
smooth
surfaces
where
there
was
hold
even
for
his
strong
hobbit
fingers
and
the
ledges
were
far
apart
But
last
too
was
down
Well
cried
done
escaped
from
the
Emyn
Muil
And
now
what
next
wonder
Maybe
shall
soon
sighing
for
good
hard
rock
under
foot
again
But
Sam
did
not
answer
was
staring
back
the
cliff
Ninnyhammers
said
Noodles
beautiful
rope
There
tied
stump
and
the
bottom
Just
nice
little
stair
for
that
slinking
Gollum
could
leave
Better
put
signpost
say
which
way
gone
thought
seemed
bit
too
easy
you
can
think
any
way
could
have
both
used
the
rope
and
yet
brought
down
with
then
you
can
pass
ninnyhammer
any
other
name
your
Gaffer
gave
you
said
Frodo
Climb
and
untie
and
let
yourself
down
you
want
Sam
scratched
his
head
can
think
how
begging
your
pardon
said
But
don
like
leaving
and
that
fact
stroked
the
rope
end
and
shook
gently
goes
hard
parting
with
anything
brought
out
the
Elf
country
Made
Galadriel
herself
too
maybe
Galadriel
murmured
nodding
his
head
mournfully
looked
and
gave
one
last
pull
the
rope
farewell
the
complete
surprise
both
the
hobbits
came
loose
Sam
fell
over
and
the
long
grey
coils
slithered
silently
down
top
him
Frodo
laughed
Who
tied
the
rope
said
good
thing
held
long
did
think
that
trusted
all
weight
your
knot
Sam
did
not
laugh
may
not
much
good
climbing
Frodo
said
injured
tones
but
know
something
about
rope
and
about
knots
the
family
you
might
say
Why
grand
dad
and
uncle
Andy
after
him
him
that
was
the
Gaffer
eldest
brother
had
rope
walk
over
Tighfield
many
year
And
put
fast
hitch
over
the
stump
any
one
could
have
done
the
Shire
out
Then
the
rope
must
have
broken
frayed
the
rock
edge
expect
said
Frodo
bet
didn
said
Sam
even
more
injured
voice
stooped
and
examined
the
ends
Nor
hasn
neither
Not
strand
Then
afraid
must
have
been
the
knot
said
Frodo
Sam
shook
his
head
and
did
not
answer
was
passing
the
rope
through
his
fingers
thoughtfully
Have
your
own
way
Frodo
said
last
but
think
the
rope
came
off
itself
when
called
coiled
and
stowed
lovingly
his
pack
certainly
came
said
Frodo
and
that
the
chief
thing
But
now
got
think
our
next
move
Night
will
soon
How
beautiful
the
stars
are
and
the
Moon
They
cheer
the
heart
don
they
said
Sam
looking
Elvish
they
are
somehow
And
the
Moon
growing
haven
seen
him
for
night
two
this
cloudy
weather
beginning
give
quite
light
Yes
said
Frodo
but
won
full
for
some
days
don
think
try
the
marshes
the
light
half
moon
Under
the
first
shadows
night
they
started
out
the
next
stage
their
journey
After
while
Sam
turned
and
looked
back
the
way
they
had
come
The
mouth
the
gully
was
black
notch
the
dim
cliff
glad
got
the
rope
said
set
little
puzzle
for
that
footpad
anyhow
can
try
his
nasty
flappy
feet
those
ledges
They
picked
their
steps
away
from
the
skirts
the
cliff
among
wilderness
boulders
and
rough
stones
wet
and
slippery
with
the
heavy
rain
The
ground
still
fell
away
sharply
They
had
not
gone
very
far
when
they
came
upon
great
fissure
that
yawned
suddenly
black
before
their
feet
was
not
wide
but
was
too
wide
jump
across
the
dim
light
They
thought
they
could
hear
water
gurgling
its
depths
curved
away
their
left
northward
back
towards
the
hills
and
barred
their
road
that
direction
any
rate
while
darkness
lasted
had
better
try
way
back
southwards
along
the
line
the
cliff
think
said
Sam
might
find
some
nook
there
even
cave
something
suppose
said
Frodo
tired
and
don
think
can
scramble
among
stones
much
longer
tonight
though
grudge
the
delay
wish
there
was
clear
path
front
then
till
legs
gave
way
They
did
not
find
the
going
any
easier
the
broken
feet
the
Emyn
Muil
Nor
did
Sam
find
any
nook
hollow
shelter
only
bare
stony
slopes
frowned
over
the
cliff
which
now
rose
again
higher
and
more
sheer
they
went
back
the
end
worn
out
they
just
cast
themselves
the
ground
under
the
lee
boulder
lying
not
far
from
the
foot
the
precipice
There
for
some
time
they
sat
huddled
mournfully
together
the
cold
stony
night
while
sleep
crept
upon
them
spite
all
they
could
hold
off
The
moon
now
rode
high
and
clear
Its
thin
white
light
lit
the
faces
the
rocks
and
drenched
the
cold
frowning
walls
the
cliff
turning
all
the
wide
looming
darkness
into
chill
pale
grey
scored
with
black
shadows
Well
said
Frodo
standing
and
drawing
his
cloak
more
closely
round
him
You
sleep
for
bit
Sam
and
take
blanket
walk
and
down
sentry
for
while
Suddenly
stiffened
and
stooping
gripped
Sam
the
arm
What
that
whispered
Look
over
there
the
cliff
Sam
looked
and
breathed
sharply
through
his
teeth
Ssss
said
That
what
that
Gollum
Snakes
and
adders
And
think
that
thought
that
puzzle
him
with
our
bit
climb
Look
him
Like
nasty
crawling
spider
wall
Down
the
face
precipice
sheer
and
almost
smooth
seemed
the
pale
moonlight
small
black
shape
was
moving
with
its
thin
limbs
splayed
out
Maybe
its
soft
clinging
hands
and
toes
were
finding
crevices
and
holds
that
hobbit
could
ever
have
seen
used
but
looked
was
just
creeping
down
sticky
pads
like
some
large
prowling
thing
insect
kind
And
was
coming
down
head
first
was
smelling
its
way
Now
and
again
lifted
its
head
slowly
turning
right
back
its
long
skinny
neck
and
the
hobbits
caught
glimpse
two
small
pale
gleaming
lights
its
eyes
that
blinked
the
moon
for
moment
and
then
were
quickly
lidded
again
you
think
can
see
said
Sam
don
know
said
Frodo
quietly
but
think
not
hard
even
for
friendly
eyes
see
these
elven
cloaks
cannot
see
you
the
shadow
even
few
paces
And
heard
that
doesn
like
Sun
Moon
Then
why
coming
down
just
here
asked
Sam
Quietly
Sam
said
Frodo
can
smell
perhaps
And
can
hear
keen
Elves
believe
think
has
heard
something
now
our
voices
probably
did
lot
shouting
away
back
there
and
were
talking
far
too
loudly
until
minute
ago
Well
sick
him
said
Sam
come
once
too
often
for
and
going
have
word
with
him
can
don
suppose
could
give
him
the
slip
now
anyway
Drawing
his
grey
hood
well
over
his
face
Sam
crept
stealthily
towards
the
cliff
Careful
whispered
Frodo
coming
behind
Don
alarm
him
much
more
dangerous
than
looks
The
black
crawling
shape
was
now
three
quarters
the
way
down
and
perhaps
fifty
feet
less
above
the
cliff
foot
Crouching
stone
still
the
shadow
large
boulder
the
hobbits
watched
him
seemed
have
come
difficult
passage
troubled
about
something
They
could
hear
him
snuffling
and
now
and
again
there
was
harsh
hiss
breath
that
sounded
like
curse
lifted
his
head
and
they
thought
they
heard
him
spit
Then
moved
again
Now
they
could
hear
his
voice
creaking
and
whistling
Ach
sss
Cautious
precious
More
haste
less
speed
musstn
rissk
our
neck
musst
precious
precious
_gollum_
lifted
his
head
again
blinked
the
moon
and
quickly
shut
his
eyes
hate
hissed
Nassty
nassty
shivery
light
sss
spies
precious
hurts
our
eyes
was
getting
lower
now
and
the
hisses
became
sharper
and
clearer
Where

where

Precious
Precious
ours
and
wants
The
thieves

the
filthy
little
thieves
Where

they
with
Precious
Curse

knew

here

whispered
Sam
And
what
his
Precious
Does
mean
the
Hsh
breathed
Frodo
getting
near
now
near
enough
hear
whisper
Indeed
Gollum
had
suddenly
paused
again
and
his
large
head
its
scrawny
neck
was
lolling
from
side
side
was
listening
His
pale
eyes
were
half
unlidded
Sam
restrained
himself
though
his
fingers
were
twitching
His
eyes
filled
with
anger
and
disgust
were
fixed
the
wretched
creature
now
began
move
again
still
whispering
and
hissing
himself
last
was
more
than
dozen
feet
from
the
ground
right
above
their
heads
From
that
point
there
was
sheer
drop
for
the
cliff
was
slightly
undercut
and
even
Gollum
could
not
find
hold
any
kind
seemed
trying
twist
round
legs
first
when
suddenly
with
shrill
whistling
shriek
fell
did
curled
his
legs
and
arms
round
him
like
spider
whose
descending
thread
snapped
Sam
was
out
his
hiding
flash
and
crossed
the
space
between
him
and
the
cliff
foot
couple
leaps
Before
Gollum
could
get
was
top
him
But
found
Gollum
more
than
bargained
for
even
taken
like
that
suddenly
off
his
guard
after
fall
Before
Sam
could
get
hold
long
legs
and
arms
were
wound
round
him
pinning
his
arms
and
clinging
grip
soft
but
horribly
strong
was
squeezing
him
like
slowly
tightening
cords
clammy
fingers
were
feeling
for
his
throat
Then
sharp
teeth
bit
into
his
shoulder
All
could
was
butt
his
hard
round
head
sideways
into
the
creature
face
Gollum
hissed
and
spat
but
did
not
let
Things
would
have
gone
ill
with
Sam
had
been
alone
But
Frodo
sprang
and
drew
Sting
from
its
sheath
With
his
left
hand
drew
back
Gollum
head
his
thin
lank
hair
stretching
his
long
neck
and
forcing
his
pale
venomous
eyes
stare
the
sky
Let
Gollum
said
This
Sting
You
have
seen
before
once
upon
time
Let
you
feel
this
time
cut
your
throat
Gollum
collapsed
and
went
loose
wet
string
Sam
got
fingering
his
shoulder
His
eyes
smouldered
with
anger
but
could
not
avenge
himself
his
miserable
enemy
lay
grovelling
the
stones
whimpering
Don
hurt
Don
let
them
hurt
precious
They
won
hurt
will
they
nice
little
hobbitses
didn
mean
harm
but
they
jumps
like
cats
poor
mices
they
did
precious
And
lonely
_gollum_
nice
them
very
nice
they
nice
won
yes
yess
Well
what
done
with

Sam
Tie
can
come
sneaking
after
more
say
But
that

whimpered
Gollum
Cruel
little
hobbitses
Tie
the
cold
hard
lands
and
leave
_gollum_
_gollum_
Sobs
welled
his
gobbling
throat
said
Frodo
kill
him
must
kill
him
outright
But
can
that
not
things
are
Poor
wretch
has
done
harm
hasn
said
Sam
rubbing
his
shoulder
Anyway
meant
_and_
means
warrant
Throttle
our
sleep
that
his
plan
daresay
said
Frodo
But
what
means
another
matter
paused
for
while
thought
Gollum
lay
still
but
stopped
whimpering
Sam
stood
glowering
over
him
seemed
Frodo
then
that
heard
quite
plainly
but
far
off
voices
out
the
past
_What
pity
Bilbo
did
not
stub
the
vile
creature
when
had
chance
_Pity
was
Pity
that
stayed
his
hand
Pity
and
Mercy
not
strike
without
need
not
feel
any
pity
for
Gollum
deserves
death
_Deserves
death
daresay
does
Many
that
live
deserve
death
And
some
die
that
deserve
life
Can
you
give
that
them
Then
not
too
eager
deal
out
death
the
name
justice
fearing
for
your
own
safety
Even
the
wise
cannot
see
all
ends
Very
well
answered
aloud
lowering
his
sword
But
still
afraid
And
yet
you
see
will
not
touch
the
creature
For
now
that
see
him
pity
him
Sam
stared
his
master
who
seemed
speaking
some
one
who
was
not
there
Gollum
lifted
his
head
Yess
wretched
are
precious
whined
Misery
misery
Hobbits
won
kill
nice
hobbits
won
said
Frodo
But
won
let
you
either
You

wickedness
and
mischief
Gollum
You
will
have
come
with
that
all
while
keep
eye
you
But
you
must
help
you
can
One
good
turn
deserves
another
Yess
yes
indeed
said
Gollum
sitting
Nice
hobbits
will
come
with
them
Find
them
safe
paths
the
dark
yes
will
And
where
are
they
going
these
cold
hard
lands
wonders
yes
wonders
looked
them
and
faint
light
cunning
and
eagerness
flickered
for
second
his
pale
blinking
eyes
Sam
scowled
him
and
sucked
his
teeth
but
seemed
sense
that
there
was
something
odd
about
his
master
mood
and
that
the
matter
was
beyond
argument
All
the
same
was
amazed
Frodo
reply
Frodo
looked
straight
into
Gollum
eyes
which
flinched
and
twisted
away
You
know
that
you
guess
well
enough
Sméagol
said
quietly
and
sternly
are
going
Mordor
course
And
you
know
the
way
there

Ach
sss
said
Gollum
covering
his
ears
with
his
hands
such
frankness
and
the
open
speaking
the
names
hurt
him
guessed
yes
guessed
whispered
and
didn
want
them
did
precious
not
the
nice
hobbits
Ashes
ashes
and
dust
and
thirst
there
and
pits
pits
pits
and
Orcs
thousands
Orcses
Nice
hobbits
mustn

those
places
you

Frodo
insisted
And
you
being
drawn
back
there
aren
you
Yess
Yess
shrieked
Gollum
Once
accident
was
wasn
precious
Yes
accident
But
won
back
Then
suddenly
his
voice
and
language
changed
and
sobbed
his
throat
and
spoke
but
not
them
Leave
alone
_gollum_
You
hurt
poor
hands
_gollum_
don
want
come
back

Ach
got
and
clenched
his
long
hand
into
bony
fleshless
knot
shaking
towards
the
East
won
cried
Not
for
you
Then
collapsed
again
_Gollum_
_gollum_
whimpered
with
his
face
the
ground
Don
look
away
sleep
will
not
away
sleep
your
command
Sméagol
said
Frodo
But
you
really
wish
free
him
again
then
you
must
help
And
that
fear
means
finding
path
towards
him
But
you
need
not
all
the
way
not
beyond
the
gates
his
land
Gollum
sat
again
and
looked
him
under
his
eyelids
over
there
cackled
Always
there
Orcs
will
take
you
all
the
way
Easy
find
Orcs
east
the
River
Don
ask
Sméagol
Poor
poor
Sméagol
went
away
long
ago
They
took
his
Precious
and
lost
now
Perhaps
find
him
again
you
come
with
said
Frodo
never
lost
his
Precious
said
Gollum
Get
said
Frodo
Gollum
stood
and
backed
away
against
the
cliff
Now
said
Frodo
Can
you
find
path
easier
day
night
tired
but
you
choose
the
night
start
tonight
The
big
lights
hurt
our
eyes
they
Gollum
whined
Not
under
the
White
Face
not
yet
will
behind
the
hills
soon
yess
Rest
bit
first
nice
hobbits
Then
sit
down
said
Frodo
and
don
move
The
hobbits
seated
themselves
beside
him
one
either
side
with
their
backs
the
stony
wall
resting
their
legs
There
was
need
for
any
arrangement
word
they
knew
that
they
must
not
sleep
for
moment
Slowly
the
moon
went
Shadows
fell
down
from
the
hills
and
all
grew
dark
before
them
The
stars
grew
thick
and
bright
the
sky
above
one
stirred
Gollum
sat
with
his
legs
drawn
knees
under
chin
flat
hands
and
feet
splayed
the
ground
his
eyes
closed
but
seemed
tense
thinking
listening
Frodo
looked
across
Sam
Their
eyes
met
and
they
understood
They
relaxed
leaning
their
heads
back
and
shutting
their
eyes
seeming
Soon
the
sound
their
soft
breathing
could
heard
Gollum
hands
twitched
little
Hardly
perceptibly
his
head
moved
the
left
and
the
right
and
first
one
eye
and
then
the
other
opened
slit
The
hobbits
made
sign
Suddenly
with
startling
agility
and
speed
straight
off
the
ground
with
jump
like
grasshopper
frog
Gollum
bounded
forward
into
the
darkness
But
that
was
just
what
Frodo
and
Sam
had
expected
Sam
was
him
before
had
gone
two
paces
after
his
spring
Frodo
coming
behind
grabbed
his
leg
and
threw
him
Your
rope
might
prove
useful
again
Sam
said
Sam
got
out
the
rope
And
where
were
you
off
the
cold
hard
lands
Gollum
growled
wonders
aye
wonders
find
some
your
orc
friends
warrant
You
nasty
treacherous
creature
round
your
neck
this
rope
ought
and
tight
noose
too
Gollum
lay
quiet
and
tried
further
tricks
did
not
answer
Sam
but
gave
him
swift
venomous
look
All
need
something
keep
hold
him
said
Frodo
want
him
walk
good
tying
his
legs
his
arms
seems
use
them
nearly
much
Tie
one
end
his
ankle
and
keep
grip
the
other
end
stood
over
Gollum
while
Sam
tied
the
knot
The
result
surprised
them
both
Gollum
began
scream
thin
tearing
sound
very
horrible
hear
writhed
and
tried
get
his
mouth
his
ankle
and
bite
the
rope
kept
screaming
last
Frodo
was
convinced
that
really
was
pain
but
could
not
from
the
knot
examined
and
found
that
was
not
too
tight
indeed
hardly
tight
enough
Sam
was
gentler
than
his
words
What
the
matter
with
you
said
you
will
try
run
away
you
must
tied
but
don
wish
hurt
you
hurts
hurts
hissed
Gollum
freezes
bites
Elves
twisted
curse
them
Nasty
cruel
hobbits
That
why
tries
escape
course
precious
guessed
they
were
cruel
hobbits
They
visits
Elves
fierce
Elves
with
bright
eyes
Take
off
hurts
will
not
take
off
you
said
Frodo
not
unless
paused
moment
thought
not
unless
there
any
promise
you
can
make
that
can
trust
will
swear
what
wants
yes
yess
said
Gollum
still
twisting
and
grabbling
his
ankle
hurts
Swear
said
Frodo
Sméagol
said
Gollum
suddenly
and
clearly
opening
his
eyes
wide
and
staring
Frodo
with
strange
light
Sméagol
will
swear
the
Precious
Frodo
drew
himself
and
again
Sam
was
startled
his
words
and
his
stern
voice
the
Precious
How
dare
you
said
Think
One
Ring
rule
them
all
and
the
Darkness
bind
them
Would
you
commit
your
promise
that
Sméagol
will
hold
you
But
more
treacherous
than
you
are
may
twist
your
words
Beware
Gollum
cowered
the
Precious
the
Precious
repeated
And
what
would
you
swear
asked
Frodo
very
very
good
said
Gollum
Then
crawling
Frodo
feet
grovelled
before
him
whispering
hoarsely
shudder
ran
over
him
the
words
shook
his
very
bones
with
fear
Sméagol
will
swear
never
never
let
Him
have
Never
Sméagol
will
save
But
must
swear
the
Precious
not
said
Frodo
looking
down
him
with
stern
pity
All
you
wish
see
and
touch
you
can
though
you
know
would
drive
you
mad
Not
Swear
you
will
For
you
know
where
Yes
you
know
Sméagol
before
you
For
moment
appeared
Sam
that
his
master
had
grown
and
Gollum
had
shrunk
tall
stern
shadow
mighty
lord
who
hid
his
brightness
grey
cloud
and
his
feet
little
whining
dog
Yet
the
two
were
some
way
akin
and
not
alien
they
could
reach
one
another
minds
Gollum
raised
himself
and
began
pawing
Frodo
fawning
his
knees
Down
down
said
Frodo
Now
speak
your
promise
promises
yes
promise
said
Gollum
will
serve
the
master
the
Precious
Good
master
good
Sméagol
_gollum_
_gollum_
Suddenly
began
weep
and
bite
his
ankle
again
Take
the
rope
off
Sam
said
Frodo
Reluctantly
Sam
obeyed
once
Gollum
got
and
began
prancing
about
like
whipped
cur
whose
master
has
patted
From
that
moment
change
which
lasted
for
some
time
came
over
him
spoke
with
less
hissing
and
whining
and
spoke
his
companions
direct
not
his
precious
self
would
cringe
and
flinch
they
stepped
near
him
made
any
sudden
movement
and
avoided
the
touch
their
elven
cloaks
but
was
friendly
and
indeed
pitifully
anxious
please
would
cackle
with
laughter
and
caper
any
jest
was
made
even
Frodo
spoke
kindly
him
and
weep
Frodo
rebuked
him
Sam
said
little
him
any
sort
suspected
him
more
deeply
than
ever
and
possible
liked
the
new
Gollum
the
Sméagol
less
than
the
old
Well
Gollum
whatever
call
you
said
now
for
The
Moon
gone
and
the
night
going
better
start
Yes
yes
agreed
Gollum
skipping
about
Off
There
only
one
way
across
between
the
North
end
and
the
South
end
found
did
Orcs
don
use
Orcs
don
know
Orcs
don
cross
the
Marshes
they
round
for
miles
and
miles
Very
lucky
you
came
this
way
Very
lucky
you
found
Sméagol
yes
Follow
Sméagol
took
few
steps
away
and
looked
back
inquiringly
like
dog
inviting
them
for
walk
Wait
bit
Gollum
cried
Sam
Not
too
far
ahead
now
going
your
tail
and
got
the
rope
handy
said
Gollum
Sméagol
promised
the
deep
night
under
hard
clear
stars
they
set
off
Gollum
led
them
back
northward
for
while
along
the
way
they
had
come
then
slanted
the
right
away
from
the
steep
edge
the
Emyn
Muil
down
the
broken
stony
slopes
towards
the
vast
fens
below
They
faded
swiftly
and
softly
into
the
darkness
Over
all
the
leagues
waste
before
the
gates
Mordor
there
was
black
silence
_Chapter
The
Passage
the
Marshes
Gollum
moved
quickly
with
his
head
and
neck
thrust
forward
often
using
his
hands
well
his
feet
Frodo
and
Sam
were
hard
put
keep
with
him
but
seemed
longer
have
any
thought
escaping
and
they
fell
behind
would
turn
and
wait
for
them
After
time
brought
them
the
brink
the
narrow
gully
that
they
had
struck
before
but
they
were
now
further
from
the
hills
Here
cried
There
way
down
inside
yes
Now
follows
out
out
away
over
there
pointed
south
and
east
towards
the
marshes
The
reek
them
came
their
nostrils
heavy
and
foul
even
the
cool
night
air
Gollum
cast
and
down
along
the
brink
and
length
called
them
Here
can
get
down
here
Sméagol
went
this
way
once
went
this
way
hiding
from
Orcs
led
the
way
and
following
him
the
hobbits
climbed
down
into
the
gloom
was
not
difficult
for
the
rift
was
this
point
only
some
fifteen
feet
deep
and
about
dozen
across
There
was
running
water
the
bottom
was
fact
the
bed
one
the
many
small
rivers
that
trickled
down
from
the
hills
feed
the
stagnant
pools
and
mires
beyond
Gollum
turned
the
right
southward
more
less
and
splashed
along
with
his
feet
the
shallow
stony
stream
seemed
greatly
delighted
feel
the
water
and
chuckled
himself
sometimes
even
croaking
sort
song
The
cold
hard
lands
they
bites
our
hands
they
gnaws
our
feet
The
rocks
and
stones
are
like
old
bones
all
bare
meat
But
stream
and
pool
wet
and
cool
nice
for
feet
And
now
wish
What
does
wish
said
looking
sidelong
the
hobbits
tell
you
croaked
guessed
long
ago
Baggins
guessed
glint
came
into
his
eyes
and
Sam
catching
the
gleam
the
darkness
thought
far
from
pleasant
Alive
without
breath
cold
death
never
thirsting
ever
drinking
clad
mail
never
clinking
Drowns
dry
land
thinks
island
mountain
thinks
fountain
puff
air
sleek
fair
What
joy
meet
only
wish
catch
fish
juicy
sweet
These
words
only
made
more
pressing
Sam
mind
problem
that
had
been
troubling
him
from
the
moment
when
understood
that
hir
master
was
going
adopt
Gollum
guide
the
problem
food
did
not
occur
him
that
his
master
might
also
have
thought
hut
supposed
Gollum
had
Indeed
how
had
Gollum
kept
himself
all
his
lonely
wandering
Not
too
well
thought
Sam
looks
fair
famished
Not
too
dainty
try
what
hobbit
tastes
like
there
ain
fish
wager
supposing
could
catch
napping
Well
won
not
Sam
Gamgee
for
one
They
stumbled
along
the
dark
winding
gully
for
long
time
seemed
the
tired
feet
Frodo
and
Sam
The
gully
turned
eastward
and
they
went
broadened
and
got
gradually
shallower
last
the
sky
above
grew
faint
with
the
first
grey
morning
Gollum
had
shown
signs
tiring
but
now
looked
and
halted
Day
near
whispered
Day
was
something
that
might
overhear
him
and
spring
him
Sméagol
will
stay
here
will
stay
here
and
the
Yellow
Face
won
see
should
glad
see
the
Sun
said
Frodo
but
will
stay
here
are
too
tired
any
further
present
You
are
not
wise
glad
the
Yellow
Face
said
Gollum
shows
you
Nice
sensible
hobbits
stay
with
Sméagol
Orcs
and
nasty
things
are
about
They
can
see
long
way
Stay
and
hide
with
The
three
them
settled
down
rest
the
foot
the
rocky
wall
the
gully
was
not
much
more
than
tall
man
height
now
and
its
base
there
were
wide
flat
shelves
dry
stone
the
water
ran
channel
the
other
side
Frodo
and
Sam
sat
one
the
flats
resting
their
backs
Gollum
paddled
and
scrabbled
the
stream
must
take
little
food
said
Frodo
Are
you
hungry
Sméagol
have
very
little
share
but
will
spare
you
what
can
the
word
_hungry_
greenish
light
was
kindled
Gollum
pale
eyes
and
they
seemed
protrude
further
than
ever
from
his
thin
sickly
face
For
moment
relapsed
into
his
old
Gollum
manner
are
famisshed
yes
famisshed
are
precious
said
What
they
eats
Have
they
nice
fisshes
His
tongue
lolled
out
between
his
sharp
yellow
teeth
licking
his
colourless
lips
have
got
fish
said
Frodo
have
only
got
this
held
wafer
_lembas_
and
water
the
water
here
fit
drink
Yess
yess
nice
water
said
Gollum
Drink
drink
while
can
But
what
they
got
precious
crunchable
tasty
Frodo
broke
off
portion
wafer
and
handed
him
its
leaf
wrapping
Gollum
sniffed
the
leaf
and
his
face
changed
spasm
disgust
came
over
and
hint
his
old
malice
Sméagol
smells
said
Leaves
out
the
elf
country
gah
They
stinks
climbed
those
trees
and
couldn
wash
the
smell
off
his
hands
nice
hands
Dropping
the
leaf
took
corner
the
_lembas_
and
nibbled
spat
and
fit
coughing
shook
him
Ach
spluttered
You
try
choke
poor
Sméagol
Dust
and
ashes
can
eat
that
must
starve
But
Sméagol
doesn
mind
Nice
hobbits
Sméagol
has
promised
will
starve
can
eat
hobbits
food
will
starve
Poor
thin
Sméagol
sorry
said
Frodo
but
can
help
you
afraid
think
this
food
would
you
good
you
would
try
But
perhaps
you
can
even
try
not
yet
anyway
The
hobbits
munched
their
_lembas_
silence
Sam
thought
that
tasted
far
better
somehow
than
had
for
good
while
Gollum
behaviour
had
made
him
attend
its
flavour
again
But
did
not
feel
comfortable
Gollum
watched
every
morsel
from
hand
mouth
like
expectant
dog
diner
chair
Only
when
they
had
finished
and
were
preparing
rest
was
apparently
convinced
that
they
had
hidden
dainties
that
could
share
Then
went
and
sat
himself
few
paces
away
and
whimpered
little
Look
here
Sam
whispered
Frodo
not
too
softly
did
not
really
care
whether
Gollum
heard
him
not
got
get
some
sleep
but
not
both
together
with
that
hungry
villain
nigh
promise
promise
Sméagol
Gollum
won
change
his
habits
hurry
warrant
You
sleep
Frodo
and
call
you
when
can
keep
eyelids
propped
Turn
and
about
same
before
while
loose
Perhaps
you
right
Sam
said
Frodo
speaking
openly
There
_is_
change
him
but
just
what
kind
change
and
how
deep
not
sure
yet
Seriously
though
don
think
there
any
need
for
fear
present
Still
watch
you
wish
Give
about
two
hours
not
more
and
then
call
tired
was
Frodo
that
his
head
fell
forward
his
breast
and
slept
almost
soon
had
spoken
the
words
Gollum
seemed
longer
have
any
fears
curled
and
went
quickly
sleep
quite
unconcerned
Presently
his
breath
was
hissing
softly
through
his
clenched
teeth
hut
lay
still
stone
After
while
fearing
that
would
drop
off
himself
sat
listening
his
two
companions
breathing
Sam
got
and
gently
prodded
Gollum
His
hands
uncurled
and
twitched
but
made
other
movement
Sam
bent
down
and
said
_fissh_
close
his
ear
but
there
was
response
not
even
catch
Gollum
breathing
Sam
scratched
his
head
Must
really
asleep
muttered
And
was
like
Gollum
wouldn
wake
never
again
restrained
the
thoughts
his
sword
and
the
rope
that
sprang
his
mind
and
went
and
sat
down
his
master
When
woke
the
sky
above
was
dim
not
lighter
but
darker
than
when
they
had
breakfasted
Sam
leapt
his
feet
Not
least
from
his
own
feeling
vigour
and
hunger
suddenly
understood
that
had
slept
the
daylight
away
nine
hours
least
Frodo
was
still
fast
asleep
lying
now
stretched
his
side
Gollum
was
not
seen
Various
reproachful
names
for
himself
came
Sam
mind
drawn
from
the
Gaffer
large
paternal
word
hoard
then
also
occurred
him
that
his
master
had
been
right
there
had
for
the
present
been
nothing
guard
against
They
were
any
rate
both
alive
and
unthrottled
Poor
wretch
said
half
remorsefully
Now
wonder
where
got
Not
far
not
far
said
voice
above
him
looked
and
saw
the
shape
Gollum
large
head
and
ears
against
the
evening
sky
Here
what
are
you
doing
cried
Sam
his
suspicions
coming
back
soon
saw
that
shape
Sméagol
hungry
said
Gollum
back
soon
Come
back
now
shouted
Sam
Come
back
But
Gollum
had
vanished
Frodo
woke
the
sound
Sam
shout
and
sat
rubbing
his
eyes
Hullo
said
Anything
wrong
What
the
time
dunno
said
Sam
After
sundown
reckon
And
gone
off
Says
hungry
Don
worry
said
Frodo
There
help
for
But
come
back
you
see
The
promise
will
hold
yet
while
And
won
leave
his
Precious
anyway
Frodo
made
light
when
learned
that
they
had
slept
soundly
for
hours
with
Gollum
and
very
hungry
Gollum
too
loose
beside
them
Don
think
any
your
Gaffer
hard
names
said
You
were
worn
out
and
has
turned
out
well
are
now
both
rested
And
have
hard
road
ahead
the
worst
road
all
About
the
food
said
Sam
How
long
going
take
this
job
And
when
done
what
are
going
then
This
waybread
keeps
you
your
legs
wonderful
way
though
doesn
satisfy
the
innards
proper
you
might
say
not
feeling
anyhow
meaning
disrespect
them
made
But
you
have
eat
some
every
day
and
doesn
grow
reckon
got
enough
last
say
three
weeks
and
that
with
tight
belt
and
light
tooth
mind
you
been
bit
free
with
far
don
know
how
long
shall
take
finish
said
Frodo
were
miserably
delayed
the
hills
But
Samwise
Gamgee
dear
hobbit
indeed
Sam
dearest
hobbit
friend
friends
not
think
need
give
thought
what
comes
after
that
_do
the
job_
you
put
what
hope
there
that
ever
shall
And
who
knows
what
will
come
that
the
One
goes
into
the
Fire
and
are
hand
ask
you
Sam
are
ever
likely
need
bread
again
think
not
can
nurse
our
limbs
bring
Mount
Doom
that
all
can
More
than
can
begin
feel
Sam
nodded
silently
took
his
master
hand
and
bent
over
did
not
kiss
though
his
tears
fell
Then
turned
away
drew
his
sleeve
over
his
nose
and
got
and
stamped
about
trying
whistle
and
saying
between
the
efforts
Where
that
dratted
creature
was
actually
not
long
before
Gollum
returned
but
came
quietly
that
they
did
not
hear
him
till
stood
before
them
His
fingers
and
face
were
soiled
with
black
mud
was
still
chewing
and
slavering
What
was
chewing
they
did
not
ask
like
think
Worms
beetles
something
slimy
out
holes
thought
Sam
Brr
The
nasty
creature
the
poor
wretch
Gollum
said
nothing
them
until
had
drunk
deeply
and
washed
himself
the
stream
Then
came
them
licking
his
lips
Better
now
said
Are
rested
Ready
Nice
hobbits
they
sleep
beautifully
Trust
Sméagol
now
Very
very
good
The
next
stage
their
journey
was
much
the
same
the
last
they
went
the
gully
became
ever
shallower
and
the
slope
its
floor
more
gradual
Its
bottom
was
less
stony
and
more
earthy
and
slowly
its
sides
dwindled
mere
banks
began
wind
and
wander
That
night
drew
its
end
but
clouds
were
now
over
moon
and
star
and
they
knew
the
coming
day
only
the
slow
spreading
the
thin
grey
light
chill
hour
they
came
the
end
the
water
course
The
banks
became
moss
grown
mounds
Over
the
last
shelf
rotting
stone
the
stream
gurgled
and
fell
down
into
brown
bog
and
was
lost
Dry
reeds
hissed
and
rattled
though
they
could
feel
wind
either
side
and
front
wide
fens
and
mires
now
lay
stretching
away
southward
and
eastward
into
the
dim
half
light
Mists
curled
and
smoked
from
dark
and
noisome
pools
The
reek
them
hung
stifling
the
still
air
Far
away
now
almost
due
south
the
mountain
walls
Mordor
loomed
like
black
bar
rugged
clouds
floating
above
dangerous
fog
bound
sea
The
hobbits
were
now
wholly
the
hands
Gollum
They
did
now
know
and
could
not
guess
that
misty
light
that
they
were
fact
only
just
within
the
northern
borders
the
marshes
the
main
expanse
which
lay
south
them
They
could
they
had
known
the
lands
with
some
delay
have
retraced
their
steps
little
and
then
turning
east
have
come
round
over
hard
roads
the
bare
plain
Dagorlad
the
field
the
ancient
battle
before
the
gates
Mordor
Not
that
there
was
great
hope
such
course
that
stony
plain
there
was
cover
and
across
ran
the
highways
the
Orcs
and
the
soldiers
the
Enemy
Not
even
the
cloaks
Lórien
would
have
concealed
them
there
How
shape
our
course
now
Sméagol
asked
Frodo
Must
cross
these
evil
smelling
fens
need
need
all
said
Gollum
Not
hobbits
want
reach
the
dark
mountains
and
see
Him
very
quick
Back
little
and
round
little
his
skinny
arm
waved
north
and
east
and
you
can
come
hard
cold
roads
the
very
gates
His
country
Lots
His
people
will
there
looking
out
for
guests
very
pleased
take
them
straight
Him
yes
His
Eye
watches
that
way
all
the
time
caught
Sméagol
there
long
ago
Gollum
shuddered
But
Sméagol
has
used
his
eyes
since
then
yes
yes
used
eyes
and
feet
and
nose
since
then
know
other
ways
More
difficult
not
quick
but
better
don
want
Him
see
Follow
Sméagol
can
take
you
through
the
marshes
through
the
mists
nice
thick
mists
Follow
Sméagol
very
carefully
and
you
may
long
way
quite
long
way
before
catches
you
yes
perhaps
was
already
day
windless
and
sullen
morning
and
the
marsh
reeks
lay
heavy
banks
sun
pierced
the
low
clouded
sky
and
Gollum
seemed
anxious
continue
the
journey
once
after
brief
rest
they
set
out
again
and
were
soon
lost
shadowy
silent
world
cut
off
from
all
view
the
lands
about
either
the
hills
that
they
had
left
the
mountains
that
they
sought
They
went
slowly
single
file
Gollum
Sam
Frodo
Frodo
seemed
the
most
weary
the
three
and
slow
though
they
went
often
lagged
The
hobbits
soon
found
that
what
had
looked
like
one
vast
fen
was
really
endless
network
pools
and
soft
mires
and
winding
half
strangled
water
courses
Among
these
cunning
eye
and
foot
could
thread
wandering
path
Gollum
certainly
had
that
cunning
and
needed
all
His
head
its
long
neck
was
ever
turning
this
way
and
that
while
sniffed
and
muttered
all
the
time
himself
Sometimes
would
hold
his
hand
and
halt
them
while
went
forward
little
crouching
testing
the
ground
with
fingers
toes
merely
listening
with
one
ear
pressed
the
earth
was
dreary
and
wearisome
Cold
clammy
winter
still
held
sway
this
forsaken
country
The
only
green
was
the
scum
livid
weed
the
dark
greasy
surfaces
the
sullen
waters
Dead
grasses
and
rotting
reeds
loomed
the
mists
like
ragged
shadows
long
forgotten
summers
the
day
wore
the
light
increased
little
and
the
mists
lifted
growing
thinner
and
more
transparent
Far
above
the
rot
and
vapours
the
world
the
Sun
was
riding
high
and
golden
now
serene
country
with
floors
dazzling
foam
but
only
passing
ghost
her
could
they
see
below
bleared
pale
giving
colour
and
warmth
But
even
this
faint
reminder
her
presence
Gollum
scowled
and
flinched
halted
their
journey
and
they
rested
squatting
like
little
hunted
animals
the
borders
great
brown
reed
thicket
There
was
deep
silence
only
scraped
its
surfaces
the
faint
quiver
empty
seed
plumes
and
broken
grass
blades
trembling
small
air
movements
that
they
could
not
feel
Not
bird
said
Sam
mournfully
birds
said
Gollum
Nice
birds
licked
his
teeth
birds
here
There
are
snakeses
wormses
things
the
pools
Lots
things
lots
nasty
things
birds
ended
sadly
Sam
looked
him
with
distaste
passed
the
third
day
their
journey
with
Gollum
Before
the
shadows
evening
were
long
happier
lands
they
went
again
always
and
with
only
brief
halts
These
they
made
not
much
for
rest
help
Gollum
for
now
even
had
forward
with
great
care
and
was
sometimes
loss
for
while
They
had
come
the
very
midst
the
Dead
Marshes
and
was
dark
They
walked
slowly
stooping
keeping
close
line
following
attentively
every
move
that
Gollum
made
The
fens
grew
more
wet
opening
into
wide
stagnant
meres
among
which
grew
more
and
more
difficult
find
the
firmer
places
where
feet
could
tread
without
sinking
into
gurgling
mud
The
travellers
were
light
maybe
none
them
would
ever
have
found
way
through
Presently
grew
altogether
dark
the
air
itself
seemed
black
and
heavy
breathe
When
lights
appeared
Sam
rubbed
his
eyes
thought
his
head
was
going
queer
first
saw
one
with
the
corner
his
left
eye
wisp
pale
sheen
that
faded
away
but
others
appeared
soon
after
some
like
dimly
shining
smoke
some
like
misty
flames
flickering
slowly
above
unseen
candles
here
and
there
they
twisted
like
ghostly
sheets
unfurled
hidden
hands
But
neither
his
companions
spoke
word
last
Sam
could
bear
longer
What
all
this
Gollum
said
whisper
These
lights
They
all
round
now
Are
trapped
Who
are
they
Gollum
looked
dark
water
was
before
him
and
was
crawling
the
ground
this
way
and
that
doubtful
the
way
Yes
they
are
all
round
whispered
The
tricksy
lights
Candles
corpses
yes
yes
Don
you
heed
them
Don
look
Don
follow
them
Where
the
master
Sam
looked
back
and
found
that
Frodo
had
lagged
again
could
not
see
him
went
some
paces
back
into
the
darkness
not
daring
move
far
call
more
than
hoarse
whisper
Suddenly
stumbled
against
Frodo
who
was
standing
lost
thought
looking
the
pale
lights
His
hands
hung
stiff
his
sides
water
and
slime
were
dripping
from
them
Come
Frodo
said
Sam
Don
look
them
Gollum
says
mustn
Let
keep
with
him
and
get
out
this
cursed
place
quick
can
can
All
right
said
Frodo
returning
out
dream
coming
Hurrying
forward
again
Sam
tripped
catching
his
foot
some
old
root
tussock
fell
and
came
heavily
his
hands
which
sank
deep
into
sticky
ooze
that
his
face
was
brought
close
the
surface
the
dark
mere
There
was
faint
hiss
noisome
smell
went
the
lights
flickered
and
danced
and
swirled
For
moment
the
water
below
him
looked
like
some
window
glazed
with
grimy
glass
through
which
was
peering
Wrenching
his
hands
out
the
bog
sprang
back
with
cry
There
are
dead
things
dead
faces
the
water
said
with
horror
Dead
faces
Gollum
laughed
The
Dead
Marshes
yes
yes
that
their
names
cackled
You
should
not
look
when
the
candles
are
lit
Who
are
they
What
are
they
asked
Sam
shuddering
turning
Frodo
who
was
now
behind
him
don
know
said
Frodo
dreamlike
voice
But
have
seen
them
too
the
pools
when
the
candles
were
lit
They
lie
all
the
pools
pale
faces
deep
deep
under
the
dark
water
saw
them
grim
faces
and
evil
and
noble
faces
and
sad
Many
faces
proud
and
fair
and
weeds
their
silver
hair
But
all
foul
all
rotting
all
dead
fell
light
them
Frodo
hid
his
eyes
his
hands
know
not
who
they
are
but
thought
saw
there
Men
and
Elves
and
Orcs
beside
them
Yes
yes
said
Gollum
All
dead
all
rotten
Elves
and
Men
and
Orcs
The
Dead
Marshes
There
was
great
battle
long
ago
yes
they
told
him
when
Sméagol
was
young
when
was
young
before
the
Precious
came
was
great
battle
Tall
Men
with
long
swords
and
terrible
Elves
and
Orcses
shrieking
They
fought
the
plain
for
days
and
months
the
Black
Gates
But
the
Marshes
have
grown
since
then
swallowed
the
graves
always
creeping
creeping
But
that
age
and
more
ago
said
Sam
The
Dead
can
really
there
some
devilry
hatched
the
Dark
Land
Who
knows
Sméagol
doesn
know
answered
Gollum
You
cannot
reach
them
you
cannot
touch
them
tried
once
yes
precious
tried
once
but
you
cannot
reach
them
Only
shapes
see
perhaps
not
touch
precious
All
dead
Sam
looked
darkly
him
and
shuddered
again
thinking
that
guessed
why
Sméagol
had
tried
touch
them
Well
don
want
see
them
said
Never
again
Can
get
and
get
away
Yes
yes
said
Gollum
But
slowly
very
slowly
Very
carefully
hobbits
down
join
the
Dead
ones
and
light
little
candles
Follow
Sméagol
Don
look
lights
crawled
away
the
right
seeking
for
path
round
the
mere
They
came
close
behind
stooping
often
using
their
hands
even
did
Three
precious
little
Gollums
row
shall
this
goes
much
longer
thought
Sam
last
they
came
the
end
the
black
mere
and
they
crossed
perilously
crawling
hopping
from
one
treacherous
island
tussock
another
Often
they
floundered
stepping
falling
hands
first
into
waters
noisome
cesspool
till
they
were
slimed
and
fouled
almost
their
necks
and
stank
one
another
nostrils
was
late
the
night
when
length
they
reached
firmer
ground
again
Gollum
hissed
and
whispered
himself
but
appeared
that
was
pleased
some
mysterious
way
some
blended
sense
feel
and
smell
and
uncanny
memory
for
shapes
the
dark
seemed
know
just
where
was
again
and
sure
his
road
ahead
Now
said
Nice
hobbits
Brave
hobbits
Very
very
weary
course
are
precious
all
But
must
take
master
away
from
the
wicked
lights
yes
yes
must
With
these
words
started
off
again
almost
trot
down
what
appeared
long
lane
between
high
reeds
and
they
stumbled
after
him
quickly
they
could
But
little
while
stopped
suddenly
and
sniffed
the
air
doubtfully
hissing
was
troubled
displeased
again
What
growled
Sam
misinterpreting
the
signs
What
the
need
sniff
The
stink
nearly
knocks
down
with
nose
held
You
stink
and
master
stinks
the
whole
place
stinks
Yes
yes
and
Sam
stinks
answered
Gollum
Poor
Sméagol
smells
but
good
Sméagol
bears
Helps
nice
master
But
that
matter
The
air
moving
change
coming
Sméagol
wonders
not
happy
went
again
but
his
uneasiness
grew
and
every
now
and
again
stood
his
full
height
craning
his
neck
eastward
and
southward
For
some
time
the
hobbits
could
not
hear
feel
what
was
troubling
him
Then
suddenly
all
three
halted
stiffening
and
listening
Frodo
and
Sam
seemed
that
they
heard
far
away
long
wailing
cry
high
and
thin
and
cruel
They
shivered
the
same
moment
the
stirring
the
air
became
perceptible
them
and
grew
very
cold
they
stood
straining
their
ears
they
heard
noise
like
wind
coming
the
distance
The
misty
lights
wavered
dimmed
and
went
out
Gollum
would
not
move
stood
shaking
and
gibbering
himself
until
with
rush
the
wind
came
upon
them
hissing
and
snarling
over
the
marshes
The
night
became
less
dark
light
enough
for
them
see
half
see
shapeless
drifts
fog
curling
and
twisting
rolled
over
them
and
passed
them
Looking
they
saw
the
clouds
breaking
and
shredding
and
then
high
the
south
the
moon
glimmered
out
riding
the
flying
wrack
For
moment
the
sight
gladdened
the
hearts
the
hobbits
but
Gollum
cowered
down
muttering
curses
the
White
Face
Then
Frodo
and
Sam
staring
the
sky
breathing
deeply
the
fresher
air
saw
come
small
cloud
flying
from
the
accursed
hills
black
shadow
loosed
from
Mordor
vast
shape
winged
and
ominous
scudded
across
the
moon
and
with
deadly
cry
went
away
westward
outrunning
the
wind
its
fell
speed
They
fell
forward
grovelling
heedlessly
the
cold
earth
But
the
shadow
horror
wheeled
and
returned
passing
lower
now
right
above
them
sweeping
the
fen
reek
with
its
ghastly
wings
And
then
was
gone
flying
back
Mordor
with
the
speed
the
wrath
Sauron
and
behind
the
wind
roared
away
leaving
the
Dead
Marshes
bare
and
bleak
The
naked
waste
far
the
eye
could
pierce
even
the
distant
menace
the
mountains
was
dappled
with
the
fitful
moonlight
Frodo
and
Sam
got
rubbing
their
eyes
like
children
wakened
from
evil
dream
find
the
familiar
night
still
over
the
world
But
Gollum
lay
the
ground
had
been
stunned
They
roused
him
with
difficulty
and
for
some
time
would
not
lift
his
face
but
knelt
forward
his
elbows
covering
the
back
his
head
with
his
large
flat
hands
Wraiths
wailed
Wraiths
wings
The
Precious
their
master
They
see
everything
everything
Nothing
can
hide
from
them
Curse
the
White
Face
And
they
tell
Him
everything
sees
knows
Ach
_gollum_
_gollum_
_gollum_
was
not
until
the
moon
had
sunk
westering
far
beyond
Tol
Brandir
that
would
get
make
move
From
that
time
Sam
thought
that
sensed
change
Gollum
again
was
more
fawning
and
would
friendly
but
Sam
surprised
some
strange
looks
his
eyes
times
especially
towards
Frodo
and
went
back
more
and
more
into
his
old
manner
speaking
And
Sam
had
another
growing
anxiety
Frodo
seemed
weary
weary
the
point
exhaustion
said
nothing
indeed
hardly
spoke
all
and
did
not
complain
but
walked
like
one
who
carries
load
the
weight
which
ever
increasing
and
dragged
along
slower
and
slower
that
Sam
had
often
beg
Gollum
wait
and
not
leave
their
master
behind
fact
with
every
step
towards
the
gates
Mordor
Frodo
felt
the
Ring
its
chain
about
his
neck
grow
more
burdensome
was
now
beginning
feel
actual
weight
dragging
him
earthwards
But
far
more
was
troubled
the
Eye
called
himself
was
that
more
than
the
drag
the
Ring
that
made
him
cower
and
stoop
walked
The
Eye
that
horrible
growing
sense
hostile
will
that
strove
with
great
power
pierce
all
shadows
cloud
and
earth
and
flesh
and
see
you
pin
you
under
its
deadly
gaze
naked
immovable
thin
frail
and
thin
the
veils
were
become
that
still
warded
off
Frodo
knew
just
where
the
present
habitation
and
heart
that
will
now
was
certainly
man
can
tell
the
direction
the
sun
with
his
eyes
shut
was
facing
and
its
potency
beat
upon
his
brow
Gollum
probably
felt
something
the
same
sort
But
what
went
his
wretched
heart
between
the
pressure
the
Eye
and
the
lust
the
Ring
that
was
near
and
his
grovelling
promise
made
half
the
fear
cold
iron
the
hobbits
did
not
guess
Frodo
gave
thought
Sam
mind
was
occupied
mostly
with
his
master
hardly
noticing
the
dark
cloud
that
had
fallen
his
own
heart
put
Frodo
front
him
now
and
kept
watchful
eye
every
movement
his
supporting
him
stumbled
and
trying
encourage
him
with
clumsy
words
When
day
came
last
the
hobbits
were
surprised
see
how
much
closer
the
ominous
mountains
had
already
drawn
The
air
was
now
clearer
and
colder
and
though
still
far
off
the
walls
Mordor
were
longer
cloudy
menace
the
edge
sight
but
grim
black
towers
they
frowned
across
dismal
waste
The
marshes
were
end
dying
away
into
dead
peats
and
wide
flats
dry
cracked
mud
The
land
ahead
rose
long
shallow
slopes
barren
and
pitiless
towards
the
desert
that
lay
Sauron
gate
While
the
grey
light
lasted
they
cowered
under
black
stone
like
worms
shrinking
lest
the
winged
terror
should
pass
and
spy
them
with
its
cruel
eyes
The
remainder
that
journey
was
shadow
growing
fear
which
memory
could
find
nothing
rest
upon
For
two
more
nights
they
struggled
through
the
weary
pathless
land
The
air
seemed
them
grew
harsh
and
filled
with
bitter
reek
that
caught
their
breath
and
parched
their
mouths
last
the
fifth
morning
since
they
took
the
road
with
Gollum
they
halted
once
more
Before
them
dark
the
dawn
the
great
mountains
reached
roofs
smoke
and
cloud
Out
from
their
feet
were
flung
huge
buttresses
and
broken
hills
that
were
now
the
nearest
scarce
dozen
miles
away
Frodo
looked
round
horror
Dreadful
the
Dead
Marshes
had
been
and
the
arid
moors
the
Noman
lands
more
loathsome
far
was
the
country
that
the
crawling
day
now
slowly
unveiled
his
shrinking
eyes
Even
the
Mere
Dead
Faces
some
haggard
phantom
green
spring
would
come
but
here
neither
spring
nor
summer
would
ever
come
again
Here
nothing
lived
not
even
the
leprous
growths
that
feed
rottenness
The
gasping
pools
were
choked
with
ash
and
crawling
muds
sickly
white
and
grey
the
mountains
had
vomited
the
filth
their
entrails
upon
the
lands
about
High
mounds
crushed
and
powdered
rock
great
cones
earth
fire
blasted
and
poison
stained
stood
like
obscene
graveyard
endless
rows
slowly
revealed
the
reluctant
light
They
had
come
the
desolation
that
lay
before
Mordor
the
lasting
monument
the
dark
labour
its
slaves
that
should
endure
when
all
their
purposes
were
made
void
land
defiled
diseased
beyond
all
healing
unless
the
Great
Sea
should
enter
and
wash
with
oblivion
feel
sick
said
Sam
Frodo
did
not
speak
For
while
they
stood
there
like
men
the
edge
sleep
where
nightmare
lurks
holding
off
though
they
know
that
they
can
only
come
morning
through
the
shadows
The
light
broadened
and
hardened
The
gasping
pits
and
poisonous
mounds
grew
hideously
clear
The
sun
was
walking
among
clouds
and
long
flags
smoke
but
even
the
sunlight
was
defiled
The
hobbits
had
welcome
for
that
light
unfriendly
seemed
revealing
them
their
helplessness
little
squeaking
ghosts
that
wandered
among
the
ash
heaps
the
Dark
Lord
Too
weary
further
they
sought
for
some
place
where
they
could
rest
For
while
they
sat
without
speaking
under
the
shadow
mound
slag
but
foul
fumes
leaked
out
catching
their
throats
and
choking
them
Gollum
was
the
first
get
Spluttering
and
cursing
rose
and
without
word
glance
the
hobbits
crawled
away
all
fours
Frodo
and
Sam
crawled
after
him
until
they
came
wide
almost
circular
pit
high
banked
upon
the
west
was
cold
and
dead
and
foul
sump
oily
many
coloured
ooze
lay
its
bottom
this
evil
hole
they
cowered
hoping
its
shadow
escape
the
attention
the
Eye
The
day
passed
slowly
great
thirst
troubled
them
but
they
drank
only
few
drops
from
their
bottles
last
filled
the
gully
which
now
they
looked
back
thought
seemed
them
place
peace
and
beauty
The
hobbits
took
turn
watch
first
tired
they
were
neither
them
could
sleep
all
but
the
sun
far
away
was
climbing
down
into
slow
moving
cloud
Sam
dozed
was
Frodo
turn
guard
lay
back
the
slope
the
pit
but
that
did
not
ease
the
sense
burden
that
was
him
looked
the
smoke
streaked
sky
and
saw
strange
phantoms
dark
riding
shapes
and
faces
out
the
past
lost
count
time
hovering
between
sleep
and
waking
until
forgetfulness
came
over
him
Suddenly
Sam
woke
thinking
that
heard
his
master
calling
was
evening
Frodo
could
not
have
called
for
had
fallen
asleep
and
had
slid
down
nearly
the
bottom
the
pit
Gollum
was
him
For
moment
Sam
thought
that
was
trying
rouse
Frodo
then
saw
that
was
not
Gollum
was
talking
himself
Sméagol
was
holding
debate
with
some
other
thought
that
used
the
same
voice
but
made
squeak
and
hiss
pale
light
and
green
light
alternated
his
eyes
spoke
Sméagol
promised
said
the
first
thought
Yes
yes
precious
came
the
answer
promised
save
our
Precious
not
let
Him
have
never
But
going
Him
yes
nearer
every
step
What
the
hobbit
going
with
wonders
yes
wonders
don
know
can
help
Master
got
Sméagol
promised
help
the
master
Yes
yes
help
the
master
the
master
the
Precious
But
was
master
then
could
help
ourselfs
yes
and
still
keep
promises
But
Sméagol
said
would
very
very
good
Nice
hobbit
took
cruel
rope
off
Sméagol
leg
speaks
nicely
Very
very
good
precious
Let
good
good
fish
sweet
one
but
ourselfs
Not
hurt
the
nice
hobbit
course
But
the
Precious
holds
the
promise
the
voice
Sméagol
objected
Then
take
said
the
other
and
let
hold
ourselfs
Then
shall
master
_gollum_
Make
the
other
hobbit
the
nasty
suspicious
hobbit
make
him
crawl
yes
_gollum_
But
not
the
nice
hobbit
not
doesn
please
Still
Baggins
precious
yes
Baggins
Baggins
stole
found
and
said
nothing
nothing
hates
Bagginses
not
this
Baggins
Yes
every
Baggins
All
peoples
that
keep
the
Precious
must
have
But
see
know
take
from
sees
knows
heard
make
silly
promises
against
His
orders
yes
Must
take
The
Wraiths
are
searching
Must
take
Not
for
Him
sweet
one
See
precious
has
then
can
escape
even
from
Him
Perhaps
grows
very
strong
stronger
than
Wraiths
Lord
Sméagol
Gollum
the
Great
_The_
Gollum
Eat
fish
every
day
three
times
day
fresh
from
the
sea
Most
Precious
Gollum
Must
have
wants
wants
wants
But
there
two
them
They
wake
too
quick
and
kill
whined
Sméagol
last
effort
Not
now
Not
yet
wants
But
and
here
there
was
long
pause
new
thought
had
wakened
Not
yet
Perhaps
not
She
might
help
She
might
yes
Not
that
way
wailed
Sméagol
Yes
wants
wants
Each
time
that
the
second
thought
spoke
Gollum
long
hand
crept
out
slowly
pawing
towards
Frodo
and
then
was
drawn
back
with
jerk
Sméagol
spoke
again
Finally
both
arms
with
long
fingers
flexed
and
twitching
clawed
towards
his
neck
Sam
had
lain
still
fascinated
this
debate
but
watching
every
move
that
Gollum
made
from
under
his
half
closed
eye
lids
his
simple
mind
ordinary
hunger
the
desire
eat
hobbits
had
seemed
the
chief
danger
Gollum
realized
now
that
was
not
Gollum
was
feeling
the
terrible
call
the
Ring
The
Dark
Lord
was
_He_
course
but
Sam
wondered
who
_She_
was
One
the
nasty
friends
the
little
wretch
had
made
his
wanderings
supposed
Then
forgot
the
point
for
things
had
plainly
gone
far
enough
and
were
getting
dangerous
great
heaviness
was
all
his
limbs
but
roused
himself
with
effort
and
sat
Something
warned
him
careful
and
not
reveal
that
had
overheard
the
debate
let
out
loud
sigh
and
gave
huge
yawn
What
the
time
said
sleepily
Gollum
sent
out
long
hiss
through
his
teeth
stood
for
moment
tense
and
menacing
and
then
collapsed
falling
forward
all
fours
and
crawling
the
bank
the
pit
Nice
hobbits
Nice
Sam
said
Sleepy
heads
yes
sleepy
heads
Leave
good
Sméagol
watch
But
evening
Dusk
creeping
Time
High
time
thought
Sam
And
time
parted
too
Yet
crossed
his
mind
wonder
indeed
Gollum
was
not
now
dangerous
turned
loose
kept
with
them
Curse
him
wish
was
choked
muttered
stumbled
down
the
bank
and
roused
his
master
Strangely
enough
Frodo
felt
refreshed
had
been
dreaming
The
dark
shadow
had
passed
and
fair
vision
had
visited
him
this
land
disease
Nothing
remained
his
memory
yet
because
felt
glad
and
lighter
heart
His
burden
was
less
heavy
him
Gollum
welcomed
him
with
dog
like
delight
chuckled
and
chattered
cracking
his
long
fingers
and
pawing
Frodo
knees
Frodo
smiled
him
Come
said
You
have
guided
well
and
faithfully
This
the
last
stage
Bring
the
Gate
and
then
will
not
ask
you
further
Bring
the
Gate
and
you
may
where
you
wish
only
not
our
enemies
the
Gate
Gollum
squeaked
seeming
surprised
and
frightened
the
Gate
master
says
Yes
says
And
good
Sméagol
does
what
asks
yes
But
when
gets
closer
see
perhaps
see
then
won
look
nice
all
with
you
said
Sam
Let
get
over
the
falling
dusk
they
scrambled
out
the
pit
and
slowly
threaded
their
way
through
the
dead
land
They
had
not
gone
far
before
they
felt
once
more
the
fear
that
had
fallen
them
when
the
winged
shape
swept
over
the
marshes
They
halted
cowering
the
evil
smelling
ground
but
they
saw
nothing
the
gloomy
evening
sky
above
and
soon
the
menace
passed
high
overhead
going
maybe
some
swift
errand
from
Barad
dûr
After
while
Gollum
got
and
crept
forward
again
muttering
and
shaking
About
hour
after
midnight
the
fear
fell
them
third
time
but
now
seemed
more
remote
were
passing
far
above
the
clouds
rushing
with
terrible
speed
into
the
West
Gollum
however
was
helpless
with
terror
and
was
convinced
that
they
were
being
hunted
that
their
approach
was
known
Three
times
whimpered
Three
times
threat
They
feel
here
they
feel
the
Precious
The
Precious
their
master
cannot
any
further
this
way
use
use
Pleading
and
kind
words
were
longer
any
avail
was
not
until
Frodo
commanded
him
angrily
and
laid
hand
his
sword
hilt
that
Gollum
would
get
again
Then
last
rose
with
snarl
and
went
before
them
like
beaten
dog
they
stumbled
through
the
weary
end
the
night
and
until
the
coming
another
day
fear
they
walked
silence
with
bowed
heads
seeing
nothing
and
hearing
nothing
but
the
wind
hissing
their
ears
_Chapter
The
Black
Gate
Closed
Before
the
next
day
dawned
their
journey
Mordor
was
over
The
marshes
and
the
desert
were
behind
them
Before
them
darkling
against
pallid
sky
the
great
mountains
reared
their
threatening
heads
Upon
the
west
Mordor
marched
the
gloomy
range
Ephel
Dúath
the
Mountains
Shadow
and
upon
the
north
the
broken
peaks
and
barren
ridges
Ered
Lithui
grey
ash
But
these
ranges
approached
one
another
being
indeed
but
parts
one
great
wall
about
the
mournful
plains
Lithlad
and
Gorgoroth
and
the
bitter
inland
sea
Núrnen
amidmost
they
swung
out
long
arms
northward
and
between
these
arms
there
was
deep
defile
This
was
Cirith
Gorgor
the
Haunted
Pass
the
entrance
the
land
the
Enemy
High
cliffs
lowered
upon
either
side
and
thrust
forward
from
its
mouth
were
two
sheer
hills
black
boned
and
bare
Upon
them
stood
the
Teeth
Mordor
two
towers
strong
and
tall
days
long
past
they
were
built
the
Men
Gondor
their
pride
and
power
after
the
overthrow
Sauron
and
his
flight
lest
should
seek
return
his
old
realm
But
the
strength
Gondor
failed
and
men
slept
and
for
long
years
the
towers
stood
empty
Then
Sauron
returned
Now
the
watch
towers
which
had
fallen
into
decay
were
repaired
and
filled
with
arms
and
garrisoned
with
ceaseless
vigilance
Stony
faced
they
were
with
dark
window
holes
staring
north
and
east
and
west
and
each
window
was
full
sleepless
eyes
Across
the
mouth
the
pass
from
cliff
cliff
the
Dark
Lord
had
built
rampart
stone
there
was
single
gate
iron
and
upon
its
battlement
sentinels
paced
unceasingly
Beneath
the
hills
either
side
the
rock
was
bored
into
hundred
caves
and
maggot
holes
there
host
orcs
lurked
ready
signal
issue
forth
like
black
ants
going
war
None
could
pass
the
Teeth
Mordor
and
not
feel
their
bite
unless
they
were
summoned
Sauron
knew
the
secret
passwords
that
would
open
the
Morannon
the
black
gate
his
land
The
two
hobbits
gazed
the
towers
and
the
wall
despair
Even
from
distance
they
could
see
the
dim
light
the
movement
the
black
guards
upon
the
wall
and
the
patrols
before
the
gate
They
lay
now
peering
over
the
edge
rocky
hollow
beneath
the
out
stretched
shadow
the
northmost
buttress
Ephel
Dúath
Winging
the
heavy
air
straight
flight
crow
maybe
would
have
flown
but
furlong
from
their
hiding
place
the
black
summit
the
nearer
tower
faint
smoke
curled
above
fire
smouldered
the
hill
beneath
Day
came
and
the
fallow
sun
blinked
over
the
lifeless
ridges
Ered
Lithui
Then
suddenly
the
cry
brazen
throated
trumpets
was
heard
from
the
watch
towers
they
blared
and
far
away
from
hidden
holds
and
outposts
the
hills
came
answering
calls
and
further
still
remote
but
deep
and
ominous
there
echoed
the
hollow
land
beyond
the
mighty
horns
and
drums
Barad
dûr
Another
dreadful
day
fear
and
toil
had
come
Mordor
and
the
night
guards
were
summoned
their
dungeons
and
deep
halls
and
the
day
guards
evil
eyed
and
fell
were
marching
their
posts
Steel
gleamed
dimly
the
battlement
Well
here
are
said
Sam
Here
the
Gate
and
looks
that
about
far
are
ever
going
get
word
but
the
Gaffer
would
have
thing
two
say
saw
now
Often
said
come
bad
end
didn
watch
step
did
But
now
don
suppose
ever
see
the
old
fellow
again
miss
his
chance
told
Sam_
more
the
pity
could
telling
long
got
breath
only
could
see
his
old
face
again
But
have
get
wash
first
wouldn
know
suppose
good
asking
what
way
now
can
further
unless
want
ask
the
orcs
for
lift
said
Gollum
use
can
further
Sméagol
said
said
the
Gate
and
then
see
And
see
yes
precious
see
Sméagol
knew
hobbits
could
not
this
way
yes
Sméagol
knew
Then
what
the
plague
did
you
bring
here
for
said
Sam
not
feeling
the
mood
just
reasonable
Master
said
Master
says
Bring
the
Gate
good
Sméagol
does
Master
said
wise
master
did
said
Frodo
His
face
was
grim
and
set
but
resolute
was
filthy
haggard
and
pinched
with
weariness
but
cowered
longer
and
his
eyes
were
clear
said
because
purpose
enter
Mordor
and
know
other
way
Therefore
shall
this
way
not
ask
anyone
with
master
wailed
Gollum
pawing
him
and
seeming
great
distress
use
that
way
use
Don
take
the
Precious
Him
eat
all
gets
eat
all
the
world
Keep
nice
master
and
kind
Sméagol
Don
let
Him
have
away
nice
places
and
give
back
little
Sméagol
Yes
yes
master
give
back
Sméagol
will
keep
safe
will
lots
good
especially
nice
hobbits
Hobbits
home
Don
the
Gate
commanded
the
land
Mordor
and
therefore
shall
said
Frodo
there
only
one
way
then
must
take
What
comes
after
must
come
Sam
said
nothing
The
look
Frodo
face
was
enough
for
him
knew
that
words
his
were
useless
And
after
all
never
had
any
real
hope
the
affair
from
the
beginning
but
being
cheerful
hobbit
had
not
needed
hope
long
despair
could
postponed
Now
they
were
come
the
bitter
end
But
had
stuck
his
master
all
the
way
that
was
what
had
chiefly
come
for
and
would
still
stick
him
His
master
would
not
Mordor
alone
Sam
would
with
him
and
any
rate
they
would
get
rid
Gollum
Gollum
however
did
not
intend
got
rid
yet
knelt
Frodo
feet
wringing
his
hands
and
squeaking
Not
this
way
master
pleaded
There
another
way
yes
indeed
there
Another
way
darker
more
difficult
find
more
secret
But
Sméagol
knows
Let
Sméagol
show
you
Another
way
said
Frodo
doubtfully
looking
down
Gollum
with
searching
eyes
Yess
Yess
indeed
There
_was_
another
way
Sméagol
found
Let
and
see
still
there
You
have
not
spoken
this
before
Master
did
not
ask
Master
did
not
say
what
meant
does
not
tell
poor
Sméagol
says
Sméagol
take
the
Gate
and
then
good
bye
Sméagol
can
run
away
and
good
But
now
says
purpose
enter
Mordor
this
way
Sméagol
very
afraid
does
not
want
lose
nice
master
And
promised
master
made
him
promise
save
the
Precious
But
master
going
take
Him
straight
the
Black
Hand
master
will
this
way
Sméagol
must
save
them
both
and
thinks
another
way
that
there
was
once
upon
time
Nice
master
Sméagol
very
good
always
helps
Sam
frowned
could
have
bored
holes
Gollum
with
his
eyes
would
have
done
His
mind
was
full
doubt
all
appearances
Gollum
was
genuinely
distressed
and
anxious
help
Frodo
But
Sam
remembering
the
overheard
debate
found
hard
believe
that
the
long
submerged
Sméagol
had
come
out
top
that
voice
any
rate
had
not
had
the
last
word
the
debate
Sam
guess
was
that
the
Sméagol
and
Gollum
halves
what
his
own
mind
called
Slinker
and
Stinker
had
made
truce
and
temporary
alliance
neither
wanted
the
Enemy
get
the
Ring
both
wished
keep
Frodo
from
capture
and
under
their
eye
long
possible
any
rate
long
Stinker
still
had
chance
laying
hands
his
Precious
Whether
there
really
was
another
way
into
Mordor
Sam
doubted
And
good
thing
neither
half
the
old
villain
don
know
what
master
means
thought
knew
that
Frodo
trying
put
end
his
Precious
for
good
and
all
there
trouble
pretty
quick
bet
Anyhow
old
Stinker
frightened
the
Enemy
and
under
orders
some
kind
from
him
was
that
give
away
rather
than
caught
helping
and
rather
than
let
his
Precious
melted
maybe
least
that
idea
And
hope
the
master
will
think
out
carefully
wise
any
but
soft
hearted
that
what
beyond
any
Gamgee
guess
what
next
Frodo
did
not
answer
Gollum
once
While
these
doubts
were
passing
through
Sam
slow
but
shrewd
mind
stood
gazing
out
towards
the
dark
cliff
Cirith
Gorgor
The
hollow
which
they
had
taken
refuge
was
delved
the
side
low
hill
some
little
height
above
long
trenchlike
valley
that
lay
between
and
the
outer
buttresses
the
mountains
the
midst
the
valley
stood
the
black
foundations
the
western
watch
tower
morning
light
the
roads
that
converged
upon
the
Gate
Mordor
could
now
clearly
seen
pale
and
dusty
one
winding
back
northwards
another
dwindling
eastwards
into
the
mists
that
clung
about
the
feet
Ered
Lithui
and
third
that
ran
towards
him
bent
sharply
round
the
tower
entered
narrow
defile
and
passed
not
far
below
the
hollow
where
stood
Westward
his
right
turned
skirting
the
shoulders
the
mountains
and
went
off
southwards
into
the
deep
shadows
that
mantled
all
the
western
sides
Ephel
Dúath
beyond
his
sight
journeyed
into
the
narrow
land
between
the
mountains
and
the
Great
River
gazed
Frodo
became
aware
that
there
was
great
stir
and
movement
the
plain
seemed
whole
armies
were
the
march
though
for
the
most
part
they
were
hidden
the
reeks
and
fumes
drifting
from
the
fens
and
wastes
beyond
But
here
and
there
caught
the
gleam
spears
and
helmets
and
over
the
levels
beside
the
roads
horsemen
could
seen
riding
many
companies
remembered
his
vision
from
afar
upon
Amon
Hen
few
days
before
though
now
seemed
many
years
ago
Then
knew
that
the
hope
that
had
for
one
wild
moment
stirred
his
heart
was
vain
The
trumpets
had
not
rung
challenge
but
greeting
This
was
assault
upon
the
Dark
Lord
the
men
Gondor
risen
like
avenging
ghosts
from
the
graves
valour
long
passed
away
These
were
Men
other
race
out
the
wide
Eastlands
gathering
the
summons
their
Overlord
armies
that
had
encamped
before
his
Gate
night
and
now
marched
swell
his
mounting
power
suddenly
made
fully
aware
the
peril
their
position
alone
the
growing
light
day
near
this
vast
menace
Frodo
quickly
drew
his
frail
grey
hood
close
upon
his
head
and
stepped
down
into
the
dell
Then
turned
Gollum
Sméagol
said
will
trust
you
once
more
lndeed
seems
that
must
and
that
fate

help
from
you
where
least
looked
for
and
your
fate
help
whom
you
long
pursued
with
evil
purpose
far
you
have
deserved
well
and
have
kept
your
promise
truly
Truly
say
and
mean
added
with
glance
Sam
for
twice
now
have
been
your
power
and
you
have
done
harm
Nor
have
you
tried
take
from
what
you
once
sought
May
the
third
time
prove
the
best
But
warn
you
Sméagol
you
are
danger
Yes
yes
master
said
Gollum
Dreadful
danger
Sméagol
bones
shake
think
but
doesn
run
away
must
help
nice
master
did
not
mean
the
danger
that
all
share
said
Frodo
mean
danger
yourself
alone
You
swore
promise
what
you
call
the
Precious
Remember
that
will
hold
you
but
will
seek
way
twist
your
own
undoing
Already
you
are
being
twisted
You
revealed
yourself
just
now
foolishly_
Give
back
Sméagol_
you
said
not
say
that
again
not
let
that
thought
grow
you
You
will
never
get
back
But
the
desire
may
betray
you
bitter
end
You
will
never
get
back
the
last
need
Sméagol
should
put
the
Precious
and
the
Precious
mastered
you
long
ago
wearing
were
command
you
you
would
obey
even
were
leap
from
precipice
cast
yourself
into
the
fire
And
such
would
command
have
care
Sméagol
Sam
looked
his
master
with
approval
but
also
with
surprise
there
was
look
his
face
and
tone
his
voice
that
had
not
known
before
had
always
been
notion
his
that
the
kindness
dear
Frodo
was
such
high
degree
that
must
imply
fair
measure
blindness
course
also
firmly
held
the
incompatible
belief
that
Frodo
was
the
wisest
person
the
world
with
the
possible
exception
Old
Bilbo
and
Gandalf
Gollum
his
own
way
and
with
much
more
excuse
his
acquaintance
was
much
briefer
may
have
_made
similar
mistake
confusing
kindness
and
blindness
any
rate
this
speech
abashed
and
terrified
him
grovelled
the
ground
and
could
speak
clear
words
but
_nice
master_
Frodo
waited
patiently
for
while
then
spoke
again
less
sternly
Come
now
Gollum
Sméagol
you
wish
tell
this
other
way
and
show
you
can
what
hope
there
enough
justify
turning
aside
from
plain
path
haste
But
Gollum
was
pitiable
state
and
Frodo
threat
had
quite
unnerved
him
was
not
easy
get
any
clear
account
out
him
amid
his
mumblings
and
squeakings
and
the
frequent
interruptions
which
crawled
the
floor
and
begged
them
both
kind
poor
little
Sméagol
After
while
grew
little
calmer
and
Frodo
gathered
bit
bit
that
traveller
followed
the
road
that
turned
west
Ephel
Dúath
would
come
time
crossing
circle
dark
trees
the
right
road
went
down
Osgiliath
and
the
bridges
the
Anduin
the
middle
the
road
went
southwards
said
Gollum
never
went
that
way
but
they
say
goes
hundred
leagues
until
you
can
see
the
Great
Water
that
never
still
There
are
lots
fishes
there
and
big
birds
eat
fishes
nice
birds
but
never
went
there
alas
never
had
chance
And
further
still
there
are
more
lands
they
say
but
the
Yellow
Face
very
hot
there
and
there
are
seldom
any
clouds
and
the
men
are
fierce
and
have
dark
faces
not
want
see
that
land
said
Frodo
But
not
wander
from
your
road
What
the
third
turning
yes
yes
there
third
way
said
Gollum
That
the
road
the
left
once
begins
climb
winding
and
climbing
back
towards
the
tall
shadows
When
turns
round
the
black
rock
you
see
suddenly
you
see
above
you
and
you
want
hide
See
see
What
will
you
see
The
old
fortress
very
old
very
horrible
now
used
hear
tales
from
the
South
when
Sméagol
was
young
long
ago
yes
used
tell
lots
tales
the
evening
sitting
the
banks
the
Great
River
the
willow
lands
when
the
River
was
younger
too
_gollum_
_gollum_
began
weep
and
mutter
The
hobbits
waited
patiently
Tales
out
the
South
Gollum
went
again
about
the
tall
Men
with
the
shining
eyes
and
their
houses
like
hills
stone
and
the
silver
crown
their
King
and
his
White
Tree
wonderful
tales
They
built
very
tall
towers
and
one
they
raised
was
silver
white
and
there
was
stone
like
the
Moon
and
round
were
great
white
walls
yes
there
were
many
tales
about
the
Tower
the
Moon
That
would
Minas
Ithil
that
Isildur
the
son
Elendil
built
said
Frodo
was
Isildur
who
cut
off
the
finger
the
Enemy
Yes
has
only
four
the
Black
Hand
but
they
are
enough
said
Gollum
shuddering
And
hated
Isildur
city
What
does
not
hate
said
Frodo
But
what
has
the
Tower
the
Moon
with
Well
master
there
was
and
there
the
tall
tower
and
the
white
houses
and
the
wall
but
not
nice
now
not
beautiful
conquered
long
ago
very
terrible
place
now
Travellers
shiver
when
they
see
they
creep
out
sight
they
avoid
its
shadow
But
master
will
have
that
way
That
the
only
other
way
For
the
mountains
are
lower
there
and
the
old
road
goes
and
until
reaches
dark
pass
the
top
and
then
goes
down
down
again
Gorgoroth
His
voice
sank
whisper
and
shuddered
But
how
will
that
help
asked
Sam
Surely
the
Enemy
knows
all
about
his
own
mountains
and
that
road
will
guarded
close
this
The
tower
isn
empty
not
empty
whispered
Gollum
seems
empty
but
isn
Very
dreadful
things
live
there
Orcs
yes
always
Orcs
but
worse
things
worse
things
live
there
too
The
road
climbs
right
under
the
shadow
the
walls
and
passes
the
gate
Nothing
moves
the
road
that
they
don
know
about
The
things
inside
know
the
Silent
Watchers
that
your
advice
said
Sam
that
should
another
long
march
south
find
ourselves
the
same
fix
worse
one
when
get
there
ever
indeed
said
Gollum
Hobbits
must
see
must
try
understand
does
not
expect
attack
that
way
His
Eye
all
round
but
attends
more
some
places
than
others
can
see
everything
all
once
not
yet
You
see
has
conquered
all
the
country
west
the
Shadowy
Mountains
down
the
River
and
holds
the
bridges
now
thinks
one
can
come
the
Moontower
without
fighting
big
battle
the
bridges
getting
lots
boats
which
they
cannot
hide
and
will
know
about
You
seem
know
lot
about
what
doing
and
thinking
said
Sam
Have
you
been
talking
Him
lately
just
hobnobbing
with
Orcs
Not
nice
hobbit
not
sensible
said
Gollum
giving
Sam
angry
glance
and
turning
Frodo
Sméagol
has
talked
Orcs
yes
course
before
met
master
and
many
peoples
has
walked
very
far
And
what
says
now
many
peoples
are
saying
here
the
North
that
the
big
danger
for
Him
and
for
will
come
out
the
Black
Gate
one
day
one
day
soon
That
the
only
way
big
armies
can
come
But
away
down
west
not
afraid
and
there
are
the
Silent
Watchers
Just
said
Sam
not
put
off
And
are
walk
and
knock
their
gate
and
ask
the
right
road
for
Mordor
are
they
too
silent
answer
not
sense
might
well
here
and
save
ourselves
long
tramp
Don
make
jokes
about
hissed
Gollum
isn
funny
Not
amusing
nut
sense
try
and
get
into
Mordor
all
But
master
says
must
go_
will
go_
then
must
try
some
way
But
must
not
the
terrible
city
course
not
That
where
Sméagol
helps
nice
Sméagol
though
one
tells
him
what
all
about
Sméagol
helps
again
found
knows
What
did
you
find
asked
Frodo
Gollum
crouched
down
and
his
voice
sank
whisper
again
little
path
leading
into
the
mountains
and
then
stair
narrow
stair
yes
very
long
and
narrow
And
then
more
stairs
And
then
his
voice
sank
even
lower
tunnel
dark
tunnel
and
last
little
cleft
and
path
high
above
the
main
pass
was
that
way
that
Sméagol
got
out
the
darkness
But
was
years
ago
The
path
may
have
vanished
now
but
perhaps
not
perhaps
not
don
like
the
sound
all
said
Sam
Sounds
too
easy
any
rate
the
telling
that
path
still
there
guarded
too
Wasn
guarded
Gollum
said
this
caught
fancied
caught
green
gleam
Gollum
eye
Gollum
muttered
but
did
not
reply
not
guarded
asked
Frodo
sternly
And
did
you
_escape_
out
the
darkness
Sméagol
Were
you
not
rather
permitted
depart
upon
errand
That
least
hat
Aragorn
thought
who
found
you
the
Dead
Marshes
some
years
ago
lie
hissed
Gollum
and
evil
light
came
into
his
eyes
the
naming
Aragorn
lied
yes
did
did
escape
all
poor
self
Indeed
was
told
seek
for
the
Precious
and
have
searched
and
searched
course
have
But
not
for
the
Black
One
The
Precious
was
ours
was
mine
tell
you
did
escape
Frodo
felt
strange
certainty
that
this
matter
Gollum
was
for
once
not
far
from
the
truth
might
suspected
that
had
somehow
found
way
out
Mordor
and
least
believed
that
was
his
own
cunning
For
one
thing
noted
that
Gollum
used
and
that
seemed
usually
sign
its
rare
appearances
that
some
remnants
old
truth
and
sincerity
were
for
the
moment
top
But
even
Gollum
could
trusted
this
point
Frodo
did
not
forget
the
wiles
the
Enemy
The
escape
may
have
been
allowed
arranged
and
well
known
the
Dark
Tower
And
any
case
Gollum
was
plainly
keeping
good
deal
back
ask
you
again
said
not
this
secret
way
guarded
But
the
name
Aragorn
had
put
Gollum
into
sullen
mood
had
all
the
injured
air
liar
suspected
when
for
once
has
told
the
truth
part
did
not
answer
not
guarded
Frodo
repeated
Yes
yes
perhaps
safe
places
this
country
said
Gollum
sulkily
safe
places
But
master
must
try
home
other
way
They
could
not
get
him
say
more
The
name
the
perilous
place
and
the
high
pass
could
not
tell
would
not
Its
name
was
Cirith
Ungol
name
dreadful
rumour
Aragorn
could
perhaps
have
told
them
that
name
and
its
significance
Gandalf
would
have
warned
them
But
they
were
alone
and
Aragorn
was
far
away
and
Gandalf
stood
amid
the
ruin
Isengard
and
strove
with
Saruman
delayed
treason
Yet
even
spoke
his
last
words
Saruman
and
the
_palantír_
crashed
fire
upon
the
steps
Orthanc
his
thought
was
ever
upon
Frodo
and
Samwise
over
the
long
leagues
his
mind
sought
for
them
hope
and
pity
Maybe
Frodo
felt
not
knowing
had
upon
Amon
Hen
even
though
believed
that
Gandalf
was
gone
gone
for
ever
into
the
shadow
Moria
far
away
sat
upon
the
ground
for
long
while
silent
his
head
bowed
striving
recall
all
that
Gandalf
had
said
him
But
for
this
choice
could
recall
counsel
Indeed
Gandalf
guidance
had
been
taken
from
them
too
soon
too
soon
while
the
Dark
Land
was
still
very
far
away
How
they
should
enter
the
last
Gandalf
had
not
said
Perhaps
could
not
say
Into
the
stronghold
the
Enemy
the
North
into
Dol
Guldur
had
once
ventured
But
into
Mordor
the
Mountain
Fire
and
Barad
dûr
since
the
Dark
Lord
rose
power
again
had
ever
journeyed
there
Frodo
did
not
think
And
here
was
little
halfling
from
the
Shire
simple
hobbit
the
quiet
countryside
expected
find
way
where
the
great
ones
could
not
dared
not
was
evil
fate
But
had
taken
himself
his
own
sitting
room
the
far
off
spring
another
year
remote
now
that
was
like
chapter
story
the
world
youth
when
the
Trees
Silver
and
Gold
were
still
bloom
This
was
evil
choice
Which
way
should
choose
And
both
led
terror
and
death
what
good
lay
choice
The
day
drew
deep
silence
fell
upon
the
little
grey
hollow
where
they
lay
near
the
borders
the
land
fear
silence
that
could
felt
were
thick
veil
that
cut
them
off
from
all
the
world
about
them
Above
them
was
dome
pale
sky
barred
with
fleeting
smoke
but
seemed
high
and
far
away
seen
through
great
deeps
air
heavy
with
brooding
thought
Not
even
eagle
poised
against
the
sun
would
have
marked
the
hobbits
sitting
there
under
the
weight
doom
silent
not
moving
shrouded
their
thin
grey
cloaks
For
moment
might
have
paused
consider
Gollum
tiny
figure
sprawling
the
ground
there
perhaps
lay
the
famished
skeleton
some
child
Men
its
ragged
garment
still
clinging
its
long
arms
and
legs
almost
bone
white
and
bone
thin
flesh
worth
peck
Frodo
head
was
bowed
over
his
knees
but
Sam
leaned
back
with
hands
behind
his
head
staring
out
his
hood
the
empty
sky
least
for
long
while
was
empty
Then
presently
Sam
thought
saw
dark
bird
like
figure
wheel
into
the
circle
his
sight
and
hover
and
then
wheel
away
again
Two
more
followed
and
then
fourth
They
were
very
small
look
yet
knew
somehow
that
they
were
huge
with
vast
stretch
pinion
flying
great
height
covered
his
eyes
and
bent
forward
cowering
The
same
warning
fear
was
him
had
felt
the
presence
the
Black
Riders
the
helpless
horror
that
had
come
with
the
cry
the
wind
and
the
shadow
the
moon
though
now
was
not
crushing
compelling
the
menace
was
more
remote
But
menace
was
Frodo
felt
too
His
thought
was
broken
stirred
and
shivered
but
did
not
look
Gollum
huddled
himself
together
like
cornered
spider
The
winged
shapes
wheeled
and
stooped
swiftly
down
speeding
back
Mordor
Sam
took
deep
breath
The
Riders
are
about
again
the
air
said
hoarse
whisper
saw
them
you
think
they
could
see
They
were
very
high
And
they
are
Black
Riders
same
before
then
they
can
see
much
daylight
can
they
perhaps
not
said
Frodo
But
their
steeds
could
see
And
these
winged
creatures
that
they
ride
now
they
can
probably
see
more
than
any
other
creature
They
are
like
great
carrion
birds
They
are
looking
for
something
the
Enemy
the
watch
fear
The
feeling
dread
passed
but
the
enfolding
silence
was
broken
For
some
time
they
had
been
cut
off
from
the
world
invisible
island
now
they
were
laid
bare
again
peril
had
returned
But
still
Frodo
did
not
speak
Gollum
make
his
choice
His
eyes
were
closed
were
dreaming
looking
inward
into
his
heart
and
memory
last
stirred
and
stood
and
seemed
that
was
about
speak
and
decide
But
hark
said
What
that
new
fear
was
upon
them
They
heard
singing
and
hoarse
shouting
first
seemed
long
way
off
but
drew
nearer
was
coming
towards
them
leaped
into
all
their
minds
that
the
Black
Wings
had
spied
them
and
had
sent
armed
soldiers
seize
them
speed
seemed
too
great
for
these
terrible
servants
Sauron
They
crouched
listening
The
voices
and
the
clink
weapons
and
harness
were
very
close
Frodo
and
Sam
loosened
their
small
swords
their
sheaths
Flight
was
impossible
Gollum
rose
slowly
and
crawled
insect
like
the
lip
the
hollow
Very
cautiously
raised
himself
inch
inch
until
could
peer
over
between
two
broken
points
stone
remained
there
without
moving
for
some
time
making
sound
Presently
the
voices
began
recede
again
and
then
they
slowly
faded
away
Far
off
horn
blew
the
ramparts
the
Morannon
Then
quietly
Gollum
drew
back
and
slipped
down
into
the
hollow
More
Men
going
Mordor
said
low
voice
Dark
faces
have
not
seen
Men
like
these
before
Sméagol
has
not
They
are
fierce
They
have
black
eyes
and
long
black
hair
and
gold
rings
their
ears
yes
lots
beautiful
gold
And
some
have
red
paint
their
cheeks
and
red
cloaks
and
their
flags
are
red
and
the
tips
their
spears
and
they
have
round
shields
yellow
and
black
with
big
spikes
Not
nice
very
cruel
wicked
Men
they
look
Almost
bad
Orcs
and
much
bigger
Sméagol
thinks
they
have
come
out
the
South
beyond
the
Great
River
end
they
came
that
road
They
have
passed
the
Black
Gate
but
more
may
follow
Always
more
people
coming
Mordor
One
day
all
the
peoples
will
inside
Were
there
any
oliphaunts
asked
Sam
forgetting
his
fear
his
eagerness
for
news
strange
places
oliphaunts
What
are
oliphaunts
said
Gollum
Sam
stood
putting
his
hands
behind
his
back
always
did
when
speaking
poetry
and
began
Grey
mouse
Big
house
Nose
like
snake
make
the
earth
shake
tramp
through
the
grass
Trees
crack
pass
With
horns
mouth
walk
the
South
Flapping
big
ears
Beyond
count
years
stump
round
and
round
Never
lie
the
ground
Not

used
their

now
and
again
Not

came
back
and
not
that
all
they
said
was
believed
_news

and
not
_sure

But
heard

Frodo

laughed
the

when
Sam
trotted
out
the

_Oliphaunt_

the

had

_Chapter

Stewed
Rabbit
For
the
few
hours
daylight
that
were
left
they
rested
shifting
into
the
shade
the
sun
moved
until
last
the
shadow
the
western
rim
their
dell
grew
long
and
darkness
filled
all
the
hollow
Then
they
ate
little
and
drank
sparingly
Gollum
ate
nothing
but
accepted
water
gladly
Soon
get
more
now
said
licking
his
lips
Good

Sméagol

get

hungry
yes
_gollum_
set
his
two
large
flat
hands
his
shrunken
belly
and
pale
green
light
came
into
his
eyes
The
dusk
was
deep
when
length
they
set
out
creeping
over
the
westward
rim
the
dell
and
fading
like
ghosts
into
the
broken
country
the
borders
the
road
The
moon
was
now
three
nights
from
the
full
but
did
not
climb
over
the
mountains
until
nearly
midnight
and
the
early
night
was
very
dark
single
red
light
burned
high
the
Towers
the
Teeth
but
otherwise
sign
could
seen
heard
the
sleepless
watch
the
Morannon
For
many
miles
the
red
eye
seemed
stare
them
they
fled
stumbling
through
barren
stony
country
They
did
not
dare
take
the
road
but
they
kept
their
left
following
its
line
well
they
could
little
distance
last
when
night
was
growing
old
and
they
were
already
weary
for
they
had
taken
only
one
short
rest
the
eye
dwindled
small
fiery
point
and
then
vanished
they
had
turned
the
dark
northern
shoulder
the
lower
mountains
and
were
heading
southwards
With
hearts
strangely
lightened
they
now
rested
again
but
not
for
long
They
were
not
going
quick
enough
for
Gollum
his
reckoning
was
nearly
thirty
leagues
from
the
Morannon
the
cross
roads
above
Osgiliath
and
hoped
cover
that
distance
four
journeys
soon
they
struggled
once
more
until
the
dawn
began
spread
slowly
the
wide
grey
solitude
They
had
then
walked
almost
eight
leagues
and
the
hobbits
could
not
have
gone
any
further
even
they
had
dared
The
growing
light
revealed
them
land
already
less
barren
and
ruinous
The
mountains
still
loomed
ominously
their
left
but
near
hand
they
could
see
the
southward
road
now
bearing
away
from
the
black
roots
the
hills
and
slanting
westwards
Beyond
were
slopes
covered
with
sombre
trees
like
dark
clouds
but
all
about
them
lay
tumbled
heathland
grown
with
ling
and
broom
and
cornel
and
other
shrubs
that
they
did
not
know
Here
and
there
they
saw
knots
tall
pine
trees
The
hearts
the
hobbits
rose
again
little
spite
weariness
the
air
was
fresh
and
fragrant
and
reminded
them
the
uplands
the
Northfarthing
far
away
seemed
good
reprieved
walk
land
that
had
only
been
for
few
years
under
the
dominion
the
Dark
Lord
and
was
not
yet
fallen
wholly
into
decay
But
they
did
not
forget
their
danger
nor
the
Black
Gate
that
was
still
all
too
near
hidden
though
was
behind
the
gloomy
heights
They
looked
about
for
hiding
place
where
they
could
shelter
from
evil
eyes
while
the
light
lasted
The
day
passed
uneasily
They
lay
deep
the
heather
and
counted
out
the
slow
hours
which
there
seemed
little
change
for
they
were
still
under
the
shadows
the
Ephel
Dúath
and
the
sun
was
veiled
Frodo
slept
times
deeply
and
peacefully
either
trusting
Gollum
too
tired
trouble
about
him
but
Sam
found
difficult
more
than
doze
even
when
Gollum
was
plainly
fast
asleep
whiffling
and
twitching
his
secret
dreams
Hunger
perhaps
more
than
mistrust
kept
him
wakeful
had
begun
long
for
good
homely
meal
something
hot
out
the
pot
soon
the
land
faded
into
formless
grey
under
coming
night
they
started
out
again
little
while
Gollum
led
them
down
the
southward
road
and
after
that
they
went
more
quickly
though
the
danger
was
greater
Their
ears
were
strained
for
the
sound
hoof
foot
the
road
ahead
following
them
from
behind
but
the
night
passed
and
they
heard
sound
walker
rider
The
road
had
been
made
long
lost
time
and
for
perhaps
thirty
miles
below
the
Morannon
had
been
newly
repaired
but
went
south
the
wild
encroached
upon
The
handiwork
Men
old
could
still
seen
its
straight
sure
flight
and
level
course
now
and
again
cut
its
way
through
hillside
slopes
leaped
over
stream
upon
wide
shapely
arch
enduring
masonry
but
last
all
signs
stonework
faded
save
for
broken
pillar
here
and
there
peering
out
bushes
the
side
old
paving
stones
still
lurking
amid
weeds
and
moss
Heather
and
trees
and
bracken
scrambled
down
and
overhung
the
banks
sprawled
out
over
the
surface
dwindled
last
country
cart
road
little
used
but
did
not
wind
held
its
own
sure
course
and
guided
them
the
swiftest
way
they
passed
into
the
northern
marches
that
land
that
Men
once
called
Ithilien
fair
country
climbing
woods
and
swift
falling
streams
The
night
became
fine
under
star
and
round
moon
and
seemed
the
hobbits
that
the
fragrance
the
air
grew
they
went
forward
and
from
the
blowing
and
muttering
Gollum
seemed
that
noticed
too
and
did
not
relish
the
first
signs
day
they
halted
again
They
had
come
the
end
long
cutting
deep
and
sheer
sided
the
middle
which
the
road
clove
its
way
through
stony
ridge
Now
they
climbed
the
westward
bank
and
looked
abroad
Day
was
opening
the
sky
and
they
saw
that
the
mountains
were
now
much
further
off
receding
eastward
long
curve
that
was
lost
the
distance
Before
them
they
turned
west
gentle
slopes
ran
down
into
dim
hazes
far
below
All
about
them
were
small
woods
resinous
trees
fir
and
cedar
and
cypress
and
other
kinds
unknown
the
Shire
with
wide
glades
among
them
and
everywhere
there
was
wealth
sweet
smelling
herbs
and
shrubs
The
long
journey
from
Rivendell
had
brought
them
far
south
their
own
land
but
not
until
now
this
more
sheltered
region
had
the
hobbits
felt
the
change
clime
Here
Spring
was
already
busy
about
them
fronds
pierced
moss
and
mould
larches
were
green
fingered
small
flowers
were
opening
the
turf
birds
were
singing
Ithilien
the
garden
Gondor
now
desolate
kept
still
dishevelled
dryad
loveliness
South
and
west
looked
towards
the
warm
lower
vales
Anduin
shielded
from
the
east
the
Ephel
Dúath
and
yet
not
under
the
mountain
shadow
protected
from
the
north
the
Emyn
Muil
open
the
southern
airs
and
the
moist
winds
from
the
Sea
far
away
Many
great
trees
grew
there
planted
long
ago
falling
into
untended
age
amid
riot
careless
descendants
and
groves
and
thickets
there
were
tamarisk
and
pungent
terebinth
olive
and
bay
and
there
were
junipers
and
myrtles
and
thymes
that
grew
bushes
with
their
woody
creeping
stems
mantled
deep
tapestries
the
hidden
stones
sages
many
kinds
putting
forth
blue
flowers
red
pale
green
and
marjorams
and
new
sprouting
parsleys
and
many
herbs
forms
and
scents
beyond
the
garden
lore
Sam
The
grots
and
rocky
walls
were
already
starred
with
saxifrages
and
stonecrops
Primeroles
and
anemones
were
awake
the
filbert
brakes
and
asphodel
and
many
lily
flowers
nodded
their
half
opened
heads
the
grass
deep
green
grass
beside
the
pools
where
falling
streams
halted
cool
hollows
their
journey
down
Anduin
The
travellers
turned
their
backs
the
road
and
went
downhill
they
walked
brushing
their
way
through
bush
and
herb
sweet
odours
rose
about
them
Gollum
coughed
and
retched
but
the
hobbits
breathed
deep
and
suddenly
Sam
laughed
for
heart
ease
not
for
jest
They
followed
stream
that
went
quickly
down
before
them
Presently
brought
them
small
clear
lake
shallow
dell
lay
the
broken
ruins
ancient
stone
basin
the
carven
rim
which
was
almost
wholly
covered
with
mosses
and
rose
brambles
iris
swords
stood
ranks
about
and
water
lily
leaves
floated
its
dark
gently
rippling
surface
but
was
deep
and
fresh
and
spilled
ever
softly
out
over
stony
lip
the
far
end
Here
they
washed
themselves
and
drank
their
fill
the
falling
freshet
Then
they
sought
for
resting
place
and
hiding
place
for
this
land
fair
seeming
still
was
nonetheless
now
territory
the
Enemy
They
had
not
come
very
far
from
the
road
and
yet
even
short
space
they
had
seen
scars
the
old
wars
and
the
newer
wounds
made
the
Orcs
and
other
foul
servants
the
Dark
Lord
pit
uncovered
filth
and
refuse
trees
hewn
down
wantonly
and
left
die
with
evil
runes
the
fell
sign
the
Eye
cut
rude
strokes
their
bark
Sam
scrambling
below
the
outfall
the
lake
smelling
and
touching
the
unfamiliar
plants
and
trees
forgetful
for
the
moment
Mordor
was
reminded
suddenly
their
ever
present
peril
stumbled
ring
still
scorched
fire
and
the
midst
found
pile
charred
and
broken
bones
and
skulls
The
swift
growth
the
wild
with
briar
and
eglantine
and
trailing
clematis
was
already
drawing
veil
over
this
place
dreadful
feast
and
slaughter
but
was
not
ancient
hurried
back
his
companions
but
said
nothing
the
bones
were
best
left
peace
and
not
pawed
and
routed
Gollum
Let
find
place
lie
said
Not
lower
down
Higher
for
little
way
back
above
the
lake
they
found
deep
brown
bed
last
year
fern
Beyond
was
thicket
dark
leaved
bay
trees
climbing
steep
bank
that
was
crowned
with
old
cedars
Here
they
decided
rest
and
pass
the
day
which
already
promised
bright
and
warm
good
day
for
strolling
their
way
along
the
groves
and
glades
Ithilien
but
though
Orcs
may
shun
the
sunlight
there
were
too
many
places
here
where
they
could
lie
hid
and
watch
and
other
evil
eyes
were
abroad
Sauron
had
many
servants
Gollum
any
case
would
not
move
under
the
Yellow
Face
Soon
would
look
over
the
dark
ridges
the
Ephel
Dúath
and
would
faint
and
cower
the
light
and
heat
Sam
had
been
giving
earnest
thought
food
they
marched
Now
that
the
despair
the
impassable
Gate
was
behind
him
did
not
feel
inclined
his
master
take
thought
for
their
livelihood
beyond
the
end
their
errand
and
anyway
seemed
wiser
him
save
the
waybread
the
Elves
for
worse
times
ahead
Six
days
more
had
passed
since
reckoned
that
they
had
only
bare
supply
for
three
weeks
reach
the
Fire
that
time
lucky
this
rate
thought
And
might
wanting
get
back
might
Besides
the
end
long
night
march
and
after
bathing
and
drinking
felt
even
more
hungry
than
usual
supper
breakfast
the
fire
the
old
kitchen
Bagshot
Row
was
what
really
wanted
idea
struck
him
and
turned
Gollum
Gollum
had
just
begun
sneak
off
his
own
and
was
crawling
away
all
fours
through
the
fern
Gollum
said
Sam
Where
are
you
going
Hunting
Well
see
here
old
noser
you
don
like
our
food
and
not
sorry
for
change
myself
Your
new
motto
_always
ready
help_
Could
you
find
anything
fit
for
hungry
hobbit
Yes
perhaps
yes
said
Gollum
Sméagol
always
helps
they
asks
they
asks
nicely
Right
said
Sam
does
ask
And
that
isn
nice
enough
begs
Gollum
disappeared
was
away
some
time
and
Frodo
after
few
mouthfuls
_lembas_
settled
deep
into
the
brown
fern
and
went
sleep
Sam
looked
him
The
early
daylight
was
only
just
creeping
down
into
the
shadows
under
the
trees
but
saw
his
master
face
very
clearly
and
his
hands
too
lying
rest
the
ground
beside
him
was
reminded
suddenly
Frodo
had
lain
asleep
the
house
Elrond
after
his
deadly
wound
Then
had
kept
watch
Sam
had
noticed
that
times
light
seemed
shining
faintly
within
but
now
the
light
was
even
clearer
and
stronger
Frodo
face
was
peaceful
the
marks
fear
and
care
had
left
but
looked
old
old
and
beautiful
the
chiselling
the
shaping
years
was
now
revealed
many
fine
lines
that
had
before
been
hidden
though
the
identity
the
face
was
not
changed
Not
that
Sam
Gamgee
put
that
way
himself
shook
his
head
finding
words
useless
and
murmured
love
him
like
that
and
sometimes
shines
through
somehow
But
love
him
whether
Gollum
returned
quietly
and
peered
over
Sam
shoulder
Looking
Frodo
shut
his
eyes
and
crawled
away
without
sound
Sam
came
him
moment
later
and
found
him
chewing
something
and
muttering
himself
the
ground
beside
him
lay
two
small
rabbits
which
was
beginning
eye
greedily
Sméagol
always
helps
said
has
brought
rabbits
nice
rabbits
But
master
has
gone
sleep
and
perhaps
Sam
wants
sleep
Doesn
want
rabbits
now
Sméagol
tries
help
but
can
catch
things
all
minute
Sam
however
had
objection
rabbit
all
and
said
least
not
cooked
rabbit
All
hobbits
course
can
cook
for
they
begin
learn
the
art
before
their
letters
which
many
never
reach
but
Sam
was
good
cook
even
hobbit
reckoning
and
had
done
good
deal
the
camp
cooking
their
travels
when
there
was
chance
still
hopefully
carried
some
his
gear
his
pack
small
tinder
box
two
small
shallow
pans
the
smaller
fitting
into
the
larger
inside
them
wooden
spoon
short
two
pronged
fork
and
some
skewers
were
stowed
and
hidden
the
bottom
the
pack
flat
wooden
box
dwindling
treasure
some
salt
But
needed
fire
and
other
things
besides
thought
for
bit
while
took
out
his
knife
cleaned
and
whetted
and
began
dress
the
rabbits
was
not
going
leave
Frodo
alone
asleep
even
for
few
minutes
Now
Gollum
said
another
job
for
you
and
fill
these
pans
with
water
and
bring
back
Sméagol
will
fetch
water
yes
said
Gollum
But
what
does
the
hobbit
want
all
that
water
for
has
drunk
has
washed
Never
you
mind
said
Sam
you
can
guess
you
soon
find
out
And
the
sooner
you
fetch
the
water
the
sooner
you
learn
Don
you
damage
one
pans
carve
you
into
mincemeat
While
Gollum
was
away
Sam
took
another
look
Frodo
was
still
sleeping
quietly
but
Sam
was
now
struck
most
the
leanness
his
face
and
hands
Too
thin
and
drawn
muttered
Not
right
for
hobbit
can
get
these
coneys
cooked
going
wake
him
Sam
gathered
pile
the
driest
fern
and
then
scrambled
the
bank
collecting
bundle
twigs
and
broken
wood
the
fallen
branch
cedar
the
top
gave
him
good
supply
cut
out
some
turves
the
foot
the
bank
just
outside
the
fern
brake
and
made
shallow
hole
and
laid
his
fuel
Being
handy
with
flint
and
tinder
soon
had
small

made
little
smoke
but
gave
off
aromatic
scent
was
just
stooping
over
his
fire
shielding
and
building
with
heavier
wood
when
Gollum
returned
carrying
the
pans
carefully
and
grumbling
himself
set
the
pans
down
and
then
suddenly
saw
what
Sam
was
doing
gave
thin
hissing
shriek
and
seemed
both
frightened
and
angry
Ach
Sss
cried
Silly
hobbits

They

Sam

Not

Gollum

Sam

But

Eat

the

Sam
Each

You

happier

that
any
comfort

Gollum
withdrew
grumbling
and
crawled
into
the
fern
Sam
busied
himself
with
his
pans
What
hobbit
needs
with
coney
said
himself
some
herbs
and
roots
especially
taters
not
mention
bread
Herbs
can
manage
seemingly
Gollum
called
softly
Third
time
pays
for
all
want
some
herbs
Gollum
head
peeped
out
the
fern
but
his
looks
were
neither
helpful
nor
friendly
few
bay
leaves
some
thyme
and
sage
will
before
the
water
boils
said
Sam
said
Gollum
Sméagol
not
pleased
And
Sméagol
doesn
like
smelly
leaves
doesn
eat
grasses
roots
precious
not
till
starving
very
sick

Sméagol
Sméagol

Sam
Sam

head
yes

And
make
him

for
turnips
and
carrots

the
time

dozen

Sméagol

Gollum

and
very
tired
and
this
hobbit
not
nice
not

all
Sméagol

grub
for
roots
and
carrotses
and
taters
What
taters
precious
what
taters

said
Sam
The
Gaffer
delight
and
rare
good
ballast
for
empty
belly
But

won

needn
look
But

Sméagol

What

Yes

Spoiling

Give

and
keep
nassty
chips
you
hopeless
said
Sam
sleep
the
end
had
find
what
wanted
for
himself
but
did
not
have
far
not
out
sight
the
place
where
his
master
lay
still
sleeping
For
while
Sam
sat
musing
and
tending
the
fire
till
the
water
boiled
The
daylight
grew
and
the
air
became
warm
the
dew
faded
off
turf
and
leaf
Soon
the
rabbits
cut
lay
simmering
their
pans
with
the
bunched
herbs
Almost
Sam
fell
asleep
the
time
went
let
them
stew
for
close
hour
testing
them
now
and
again
with
his
fork
and
tasting
the
broth
When
thought
all
was
ready
lifted
the
pans
off
the
fire
and
crept
along
Frodo
Frodo
half
opened
his
eyes
Sam
stood
over
him
and
then
wakened
from
his
dreaming
another
gentle
unrecoverable
dream
peace
Hullo
Sam
said
Not
resting
anything
wrong
What
the
time
About
couple
hours
after
daybreak
said
Sam
and
nigh
half
past
eight
Shire
clocks
maybe
But
nothing
wrong
Though
ain
quite
what
call
right
stock
onions
taters
got
bit
stew
for
you
and
some
broth
Frodo
you
good
You
have
sup
your
mug
straight
from
the
pan
when
cooled
bit
haven
brought
bowls
nor
nothing
proper
Frodo
yawned
and
stretched
You
should
have
been
resting
Sam
said
And
lighting
fire
was
dangerous
these
parts
But
feel
hungry
Hmm
Can
smell
from
here
What
have
you
stewed
present
from
Sméagol
said
Sam
brace
young
coneys
though
fancy
Gollum
regretting
them
now
But
there
nought
with
them
but
few
herbs
Sam
and
his
master
sat
just
within
the
fern
brake
and
ate
their
stew
from
the
pans
sharing
the
old
fork
and
spoon
They
allowed
themselves
half
piece
the
Elvish
waybread
each
seemed
feast
Wheew
Gollum
Sam
called
and
whistled
softly
Come
Still
time
change
your
mind
There
some
left
you
want
try
stewed
coney
There
was
answer
well
suppose
gone
off
find
something
for
himself
finish
said
Sam
And
then
you
must
take
some
sleep
said
Frodo
Don
you
drop
off
while
nodding
Frodo
don
feel
too
sure
him
There
good
deal
Stinker
the
bad
Gollum
you
understand
him
still
and
getting
stronger
again
Not
but
what
think
try
throttle
first
now
don
see
eye
eye
and
not
pleased
with
Sam
precious
not
pleased
all
They
finished
and
Sam
went
off
the
stream
rinse
his
gear
stood
return
looked
back
the
slope
that
moment
saw
the
sun
rise
out
the
reek
haze
dark
shadow
whatever
was
that
lay
ever
the
east
and
sent
its
golden
beams
down
upon
the
trees
and
glades
about
him
Then
noticed
thin
spiral
blue
grey
smoke
plain
see
caught
the
sunlight
rising
from
thicket
above
him
With
shock
realized
that
this
was
the
smoke
from
his
little
cooking
fire
which
had
neglected
put
out
That
won
Never
thought
would
show
like
that
muttered
and
started
hurry
back
Suddenly
halted
and
listened
Had
heard
whistle
not
was
the
call
some
strange
bird
was
whistle
did
not
come
from
Frodo
direction
There
went
again
from
another
place
Sam
began
run
well
could
uphill
found
that
small
brand
burning
away
its
outer
end
had
kindled
some
fern
the
edge
the
fire
and
the
fern
blazing
had
set
the
turves
smouldering
Hastily
stamped
out
what
was
left
the
fire
scattered
the
ashes
and
laid
the
turves
the
hole
Then
crept
back
Frodo
Did
you
hear
whistle
and
what
sounded
like
answer
asked
few
minutes
back
hope
was
only
bird
but
didn
sound
quite
like
that
more
like
somebody
mimicking
bird
call
thought
And
afraid
bit
fire
been
smoking
Now
gone
and
brought
trouble
never
forgive
myself
Nor
won
have
chance
maybe
Hush
whispered
Frodo
thought
heard
voices
The
two
hobbits
trussed
their
small
packs
put
them
ready
for
flight
and
then
crawled
deeper
into
the
fern
There
they
crouched
listening
There
was
doubt
the
voices
They
were
speaking
low
and
furtively
but
they
were
near
and
coming
nearer
Then
quite
suddenly
one
spoke
clearly
close
hand
Here
Here
where
the
smoke
came
from
said
Twill
nigh
hand
the
fern
doubt
shall
have
like
coney
trap
Then
shall
learn
what
kind
thing
Aye
and
what
knows
said
second
voice
once
four
men
came
striding
through
the
fern
from
different
directions
Since
flight
and
hiding
were
longer
possible
Frodo
and
Sam
sprang
their
feet
putting
back
back
and
whipping
out
their
small
swords
they
were
astonished
what
they
saw
their
captors
were
even
more
astonished
Four
tall
Men
stood
there
Two
had
spears
their
hands
with
broad
bright
heads
Two
had
great
bows
almost
their
own
height
and
great
quivers
long
green
feathered
arrows
All
had
swords
their
sides
and
were
clad
green
and
brown
varied
hues
the
better
walk
unseen
the
glades
Ithilien
Green
gauntlets
covered
their
hands
and
their
faces
were
hooded
and
masked
with
green
except
for
their
eyes
which
were
very
keen
and
bright
once
Frodo
thought
Boromir
for
these
Men
were
like
him
stature
and
bearing
and
their
manner
speech
have
not
found
what
sought
said
one
But
what
have
found
Not
Orcs
said
another
releasing
the
hilt
his
sword
which
had
seized
when
saw
the
glitter
Sting
Frodo
hand
Elves
said
third
doubtfully
Nay
Not
Elves
said
the
fourth
the
tallest
and
appeared
the
chief
among
them
Elves
not
walk
Ithilien
these
days
And
Elves
are
wondrous
fair
look
upon
tis
said
Meaning
not
take
you
said
Sam
Thank
you
kindly
And
when
you
finished
discussing
perhaps
you
say
who
you
are
and
why
you
can
let
two
tired
travellers
rest
The
tall
green
man
laughed
grimly
Faramir
Captain
Gondor
said
But
there
are
travellers
this
land
only
the
servants
the
Dark
Tower
the
White
But
are
neither
said
Frodo
And
travellers
are
whatever
Captain
Faramir
may
say
Then
make
haste
declare
yourselves
and
your
errand
said
Faramir
have
work
and
this
time
place
for
riddling
parleying
Come
Where
the
third
your
company
The
third
Yes
the
skulking
fellow
that
saw
with
his
nose
the
pool
down
yonder
had
ill
favoured
look
Some
spying
breed
Orc
guess
creature
theirs
But
gave
the
slip
some
fox
trick
not
know
where
said
Frodo
only
chance
companion
met
upon
our
road
and
not
answerable
for
him
you
come
him
spare
him
Bring
him
send
him
only
wretched
gangrel
creature
but
have
him
under
care
for
while
But
for
are
Hobbits
the
Shire
far
the
North
and
West
beyond
many
rivers
Frodo
son
Drogo
name
and
with
Samwise
son
Hamfast
worthy
hobbit
service
have
come
long
ways
out
Rivendell
Imladris
some
call
Here
Faramir
started
and
grew
intent
Seven
companions
had
one
lost
Moria
the
others
left
Parth
Galen
above
Rauros
two
kin
Dwarf
there
was
also
and
Elf
and
two
Men
They
were
Aragorn
and
Boromir
who
said
that
came
out
Minas
Tirith
city
the
South
Boromir
all
the
four
men
exclaimed
Boromir
son
the
Lord
Denethor
said
Faramir
and
strange
stern
look
came
into
his
face
You
came
with
him
That
news
indeed
true
Know
little
strangers
that
Boromir
son
Denethor
was
High
Warden
the
White
Tower
and
our
Captain
General
sorely
miss
him
Who
are
you
then
and
what
had
you
with
him
swift
for
the
Sun
climbing
Are
the
riddling
words
known
you
that
Boromir
brought
Rivendell
Frodo
replied
Seek
for
the
Sword
that
was
Broken
Imladris
dwells
The
words
are
known
indeed
said
Faramir
astonishment
some
token
your
truth
that
you
also
know
them
Aragorn
whom
named
the
bearer
the
Sword
that
was
Broken
said
Frodo
And
are
the
Halflings
that
the
rhyme
spoke
That
see
said
Faramir
thoughtfully
see
that
might
And
what
Isildur
Bane
That
hidden
answered
Frodo
Doubtless
will
made
clear
time
must
learn
more
this
said
Faramir
and
know
what
brings
you
far
east
under
the
shadow
yonder
pointed
and
said
name
But
not
now
have
business
hand
You
are
peril
and
you
would
not
have
gone
far
field
road
this
day
There
will
hard
handstrokes
nigh
hand
ere
the
day
full
Then
death
swift
flight
bark
Anduin
will
leave
two
guard
you
for
your
good
and
for
mine
Wise
man
trusts
not
chance
meeting
the
road
this
land
return
will
speak
more
with
you
Farewell
said
Frodo
bowing
low
Think
what
you
will
friend
all
enemies
the
One
Enemy
would
with
you
halfling
folk
could
hope
serve
you
such
doughty
men
and
strong
you
seem
and
errand
permitted
May
the
light
shine
your
swords
The
Halflings
are
courteous
folk
whatever
else
they
said
Faramir
Farewell
The
hobbits
sat
down
again
but
they
said
nothing
one
another
their
thoughts
and
doubts
Close
just
under
the
dappling
shadow
the
dark
bay
trees
two
men
remained
guard
They
took
off
their
masks
now
and
again
cool
them
the
day
heat
grew
and
Frodo
saw
that
they
were
goodly
men
pale
skinned
dark
hair
with
grey
eyes
and
faces
sad
and
proud
They
spoke
together
soft
voices
first
using
the
Common
Speech
but
after
the
manner
older
days
and
then
changing
another
language
their
own
his
amazement
listened
Frodo
became
aware
that
was
the
Elven
tongue
that
they
spoke
one
but
little
different
and
looked
them
with
wonder
for
knew
then
that
they
must
Dúnedain
the
South
men
the
line
the
Lords
Westernesse
After
while
spoke
them
but
they
were
slow
and
cautious
answering
They
named
themselves
Mablung
and
Damrod
soldiers
Gondor
and
they
were
Rangers
Ithilien
for
they
were
descended
from
folk
who
lived
Ithilien
one
time
before
was
overrun
From
such
men
the
Lord
Denethor
chose
his
forayers
who
crossed
the
Anduin
secretly
how
where
they
would
not
say
harry
the
Orcs
and
other
enemies
that
roamed
between
the
Ephel
Dúath
and
the
River
close
ten
leagues
hence
the
east
shore
Anduin
said
Mablung
and
seldom
come
far
afield
But
have
new
errand
this
journey
come
ambush
the
Men
Harad
Curse
them
Aye
curse
the
Southrons
said
Damrod
Tis
said
that
there
were
dealings
old
between
Gondor
and
the
kingdoms
the
Harad
the
Far
South
though
there
was
never
friendship
those
days
our
bounds
were
away
south
beyond
the
mouths
Anduin
and
Umbar
the
nearest
their
realms
acknowledged
our
sway
But
that
long
since
Tis
many
lives
Men
since
any
passed
fro
between
Now
late
have
learned
that
the
Enemy
has
been
among
them
and
they
are
gone
over
Him
back
Him
they
were
ever
ready
His
will
have
many
also
the
East
doubt
not
that
the
days
Gondor
are
numbered
and
the
walls
Minas
Tirith
are
doomed
great
His
strength
and
malice
But
still
will
not
sit
idle
and
let
Him
all
would
said
Mablung
These
cursed
Southrons
come
now
marching
the
ancient
roads
swell
the
hosts
the
Dark
Tower
Yea
the
very
roads
that
craft
Gondor
made
And
they
ever
more
heedlessly
learn
thinking
that
the
power
their
new
master
great
enough
that
the
mere
shadow
His
hills
will
protect
them
come
teach
them
another
lesson
Great
strength
them
was
reported
some
days
ago
marching
north
One
their
regiments
due
our
reckoning
pass
some
time
ere
noon
the
road
above
where
passes
through
the
cloven
way
The
road
may
pass
but
they
shall
not
Not
while
Faramir
Captain
leads
now
all
perilous
ventures
But
his
life
charmed
fate
spares
him
for
some
other
end
Their
talk
died
down
into
listening
silence
All
seemed
still
and
watchful
Sam
crouched
the
edge
the
fern
brake
peered
out
With
his
keen
hobbit
eyes
saw
that
many
more
Men
were
about
could
see
them
stealing
the
slopes
singly
long
files
keeping
always
the
shade
grove
thicket
crawling
hardly
visible
their
brown
and
green
raiment
through
grass
and
brake
All
were
hooded
and
masked
and
had
gauntlets
their
hands
and
were
armed
like
Faramir
and
his
companions
Before
long
they
had
all
passed
and
vanished
The
sun
rose
till
neared
the
South
The
shadows
shrank
wonder
where
that
dratted
Gollum
thought
Sam
crawled
back
into
deeper
shade
stands
fair
chance
being
spitted
for
Orc
being
roasted
the
Yellow
Face
But
fancy
look
after
himself
lay
down
beside
Frodo
and
began
doze
woke
thinking
that
had
heard
horns
blowing
sat
was
now
high
noon
The
guards
stood
alert
and
tense
the
shadow
the
trees
Suddenly
the
horns
rang
out
louder
and
beyond
mistake
from
above
over
the
top
the
slope
Sam
thought
that
heard
cries
and
wild
shouting
also
but
the
sound
was
faint
came
out
some
distant
cave
Then
presently
the
noise
fighting
broke
out
near
hand
just
above
their
hiding
place
could
hear
plainly
the
ringing
grate
steel
steel
the
clang
sword
iron
cap
the
dull
beat
blade
shield
men
were
yelling
and
screaming
and
one
clear
loud
voice
was
calling
_Gondor_
_Gondor_
sounds
like
hundred
blacksmiths
all
smithying
together
said
Sam
Frodo
They
near
want
them
now
But
the
noise
grew
closer
They
are
coming
cried
Damrod
See
Some
the
Southrons
have
broken
from
the
trap
and
are
flying
from
the
road
There
they
Our
men
after
them
and
the
Captain
leading
Sam
eager
see
more
went
now
and
joined
the
guards
scrambled
little
way
into
one
the
larger
the
bay
trees
For
moment
caught
glimpse
swarthy
men
red
running
down
the
slope
some
way
off
with
green
clad
warriors
leaping
after
them
hewing
them
down
they
fled
Arrows
were
thick
the
air
Then
suddenly
straight
over
the
rim
their
sheltering
bank
man
fell
crashing
through
the
slender
trees
nearly
top
them
came
rest
the
fern
few
feet
away
face
downward
green
arrow
feathers
sticking
from
his
neck
below
golden
collar
His
scarlet
robes
were
tattered
his
corslet
overlapping
brazen
plates
was
rent
and
hewn
his
black
plaits
hair
braided
with
gold
were
drenched
with
blood
His
brown
hand
still
clutched
the
hilt
broken
sword
was
Sam
first
view
battle
Men
against
Men
and
did
not
like
much
was
glad
that
could
not
see
the
dead
face
wondered
what
the
man
name
was
and
where
came
from
and
was
really
evil
heart
what
lies
threats
had
led
him
the
long
march
from
his
home
and
would
not
really
rather
have
stayed
there
peace
all
flash
thought
which
was
quickly
driven
from
his
mind
For
just
Mablung
stepped
towards
the
fallen
body
there
was
new
noise
Great
crying
and
shouting
Amidst
Sam
heard
shrill
bellowing
trumpeting
And
then
great
thudding
and
bumping
like
huge
rams
dinning
the
ground
Ware
Ware
cried
Damrod
his
companion
May
the
Valar
turn
him
aside
Mûmak
Mûmak
his
astonishment
and
terror
and
lasting
delight
Sam
saw
vast
shape
crash
out
the
trees
and
come
careering
down
the
slope
Big
house
much
bigger
than
house
looked
him
grey
clad
moving
hill
Fear
and
wonder
maybe
enlarged
him
the
hobbit
eyes
but
the
Mûmak
Harad
was
indeed
beast
vast
bulk
and
the
like
him
does
not
walk
now
Middle
earth
his
kin
that
live
still
latter
days
are
but
memories
his
girth
and
majesty
came
straight
towards
the
watchers
and
then
swerved
aside
the
nick
time
passing
only
few
yards
away
rocking
the
ground
beneath
their
feet
his
great
legs
like
trees
enormous
sail
like
ears
spread
out
long
snout
upraised
like
huge
serpent
about
strike
his
small
red
eyes
raging
His
upturned
hornlike
tusks
were
bound
with
bands
gold
and
dripped
with
blood
His
trappings
scarlet
and
gold
flapped
about
him
wild
tatters
The
ruins
what
seemed
very
war
tower
lay
upon
his
heaving
back
smashed
his
furious
passage
through
the
woods
and
high
upon
his
neck
still
desperately
clung
tiny
figure
the
body
mighty
warrior
giant
among
the
Swertings
the
great
beast
thundered
blundering
blind
wrath
through
pool
and
thicket
Arrows
skipped
and
snapped
harmlessly
about
the
triple
hide
his
flanks
Men
both
sides
fled
before
him
but
many
overtook
and
crushed
the
ground
Soon
was
lost
view
still
trumpeting
and
stamping
far
away
What
became
him
Sam
never
heard
whether
escaped
roam
the
wild
for
time
until
perished
far
from
his
home
was
trapped
some
deep
pit
whether
raged
until
plunged
the
Great
River
and
was
swallowed
Sam
drew
deep
breath
Oliphaunt
was
said
there
are
Oliphaunts
and
have
seen
one
What
life
But
one
home
will
ever
believe
Well
that
over
have
bit
sleep
Sleep
while
you
may
said
Mablung
But
the
Captain
will
return
unhurt
and
when
comes
shall
depart
swiftly
shall
pursued
soon
news
our
deed
reaches
the
Enemy
and
that
will
not
long
quietly
when
you
must
said
Sam
need
disturb
sleep
was
walking
all
night
Mablung
laughed
not
think
the
Captain
will
leave
you
here
Master
Samwise
said
But
you
shall

_Chapter
The
Window
the
West
seemed
Sam
that
had
only
dozed
for
few
minutes
when
awoke
find
that
was
late
afternoon
and
Faramir
had
come
back
had
brought
many
men
with
him
indeed
all
the
survivors
the
foray
were
now
gathered
the
slope
nearby
two
three
hundred
strong
They
sat
wide
semicircle
between
the
arms
which
Faramir
was
seated
the
ground
while
Frodo
stood
before
him
looked
strangely
like
the
trial
prisoner
Sam
crept
out
from
the
fern
but
one
paid
any
attention
him
and
placed
himself
the
end
the
rows
men
where
could
see
and
hear
all
that
was
going
watched
and
listened
intently
ready
dash
his
master
aid
needed
could
see
Faramir
face
which
was
now
unmasked
was
stern
and
commanding
and
keen
wit
lay
behind
his
searching
glance
Doubt
was
the
grey
eyes
that
gazed
steadily
Frodo
Sam
soon
became
aware
that
the
Captain
was
not
satisfied
with
Frodo
account
himself
several
points
what
part
had
play
the
Company
that
set
out
from
Rivendell
why
had
left
Boromir
and
where
was
now
going
particular
returned
often
Isildur
Bane
Plainly
saw
that
Frodo
was
concealing
from
him
some
matter
great
importance
But
was
the
coming
the
Halfling
that
Isildur
Bane
should
waken
one
must
read
the
words
insisted
then
you
are
the
Halfling
that
was
named
doubtless
you
brought
this
thing
whatever
may
the
Council
which
you
speak
and
there
Boromir
saw
you
deny
Frodo
made
answer
said
Faramir
wish
then
learn
from
you
more
for
what
concerns
Boromir
concerns
orc
arrow
slew
Isildur
far
old
tales
tell
But
orc
arrows
are
plenty
and
the
sight
one
would
not
taken
sign
Doom
Boromir
Gondor
Had
you
this
thing
keeping
hidden
you
say
but
not
that
because
you
choose
hide
not
because
choose
answered
Frodo
does
not
belong
does
not
belong
any
mortal
great
small
though
any
could
claim
would
Aragorn
son
Arathorn
whom
named
the
leader
our
Company
from
Moria
Rauros
Why
and
not
Boromir
prince
the
City
that
the
sons
Elendil
founded
Because
Aragorn
descended
direct
lineage
father
father
from
Isildur
Elendil
son
himself
And
the
sword
that
bears
was
Elendil
sword
murmur
astonishment
ran
through
all
the
ring
men
Some
cried
aloud
The
sword
Elendil
The
sword
Elendil
comes
Minas
Tirith
Great
tidings
But
Faramir
face
was
unmoved
Maybe
said
But
great
claim
will
need
established
and
clear
proofs
will
required
should
this
Aragorn
ever
come
Minas
Tirith
had
not
come
nor
any
your
Company
when
set
out
six
days
ago
Boromir
was
satisfied
that
claim
said
Frodo
Indeed
Boromir
were
here
would
answer
all
your
questions
And
since
was
already
Rauros
many
days
back
and
intended
then
straight
your
city
you
return
you
may
soon
learn
the
answers
there
part
the
Company
was
known
him
all
the
others
for
was
appointed
Elrond
Imladris
himself
before
the
whole
Council
that
errand
came
into
this
country
but
not
mine
reveal
any
outside
the
Company
Yet
those
who
claim
oppose
the
Enemy
would
well
not
hinder
Frodo
tone
was
proud
whatever
felt
and
Sam
approved
but
did
not
appease
Faramir
said
You
bid
mind
own
affairs
and
get
back
home
and
let
you
Boromir
will
tell
all
when
comes
When
comes
say
you
Were
you
friend
Boromir
Vividly
before
Frodo
mind
came
the
memory
Boromir
assault
upon
him
and
for
moment
hesitated
Faramir
eyes
watching
him
grew
harder
Boromir
was
valiant
member
our
Company
said
Frodo
length
Yes
was
his
friend
for
part
Faramir
smiled
grimly
Then
you
would
grieve
learn
that
Boromir
dead
would
grieve
indeed
said
Frodo
Then
catching
the
look
Faramir
eyes
faltered
Dead
said
you
mean
that
dead
and
that
you
knew
You
have
been
trying
trap
words
playing
with
are
you
now
trying
snare
with
falsehood
would
not
snare
even
orc
with
falsehood
said
Faramir
How
then
did
die
and
how
you
know
Since
you
say
that
none
the
Company
had
reached
the
city
when
you
left
the
manner
his
death
had
hoped
that
his
friend
and
companion
would
tell
how
was
But
was
alive
and
strong
when
parted
And
lives
still
for
all
that
know
Though
surely
there
are
many
perils
the
world
Many
indeed
said
Faramir
and
treachery
not
the
least
Sam
had
been
getting
more
and
more
impatient
and
angry
this
conversation
These
last
words
were
more
than
could
bear
and
bursting
into
the
middle
the
ring
strode
his
master
side
Begging
your
pardon
Frodo
said
but
this
has
gone
long
enough
right
talk
you
After
all
you
gone
through
much
for
his
good
and
all
these
great
Men
for
anyone
else
See
here
Captain
planted
himself
squarely
front
Faramir
his
hands
his
hips
and
look
his
face
was
addressing
young
hobbit
who
had
offered
him
what
called
sauce
when
questioned
about
visits
the
orchard
There
was
some
murmuring
but
also
some
grins
the
faces
the
men
looking
the
sight
their
Captain
sitting
the
ground
and
eye
eye
with
young
hobbit
legs
well
apart
bristling
with
wrath
was
one
beyond
their
experience
See
here
said
What
are
you
driving
Let
come
the
point
before
all
the
Orcs
Mordor
come
down
you
think
master
murdered
this
Boromir
and
then
ran
away
you
got
sense
but
say
and
have
done
And
then
let
know
what
you
mean
about
But
pity
that
folk
talk
about
fighting
the
Enemy
can
let
others
their
bit
their
own
way
without
interfering
mighty
pleased
could
see
you
now
Think
got
new
friend
would
Patience
said
Faramir
but
without
anger
not
speak
before
your
master
whose
wit
greater
than
yours
And
not
need
any
teach
our
peril
Even
spare
brief
time
order
judge
justly
hard
matter
Were
hasty
you
might
have
slain
you
long
ago
For
commanded
slay
all
whom
find
this
land
without
the
leave
the
Lord
Gondor
But
not
slay
man
beast
needlessly
and
not
gladly
even
when
needed
Neither
talk
vain
comforted
Sit
your
master
and
silent
Sam
sat
down
heavily
with
red
face
Faramir
turned
Frodo
again
You
asked
how
know
that
the
son
Denethor
dead
Tidings
death
have
many
wings
_Night
oft
brings
news
near
kindred_
tis
said
Boromir
was
brother
shadow
sorrow
passed
over
his
face
you
remember
aught
special
mark
that
the
Lord
Boromir
bore
with
him
among
his
gear
Frodo
thought
for
moment
fearing
some
further
trap
and
wondering
how
this
debate
would
turn
the
end
had
hardly
saved
the
Ring
from
the
proud
grasp
Boromir
and
how
would
fare
now
among
many
men
warlike
and
strong
did
not
know
Yet
felt
his
heart
that
Faramir
though
was
much
like
his
brother
looks
was
man
less
self
regarding
both
sterner
and
wiser
remember
that
Boromir
bore
horn
said
last
You
remember
well
and
one
who
has
truth
seen
him
said
Faramir
Then
maybe
you
can
see
your
mind
eye
great
horn
the
wild
the
East
bound
with
silver
and
written
with
ancient
characters
That
horn
the
eldest
son
our
house
has
borne
for
many
generations
and
said
that
blown
need
anywhere
within
the
bounds
Gondor
the
realm
was
old
its
voice
will
not
pass
unheeded
Five
days
ere
set
out
this
venture
eleven
days
ago
about
this
hour
the
day
heard
the
blowing
that
horn
from
the
northward
seemed
but
dim
were
but
echo
the
mind
boding
ill
thought
father
and
for
tidings
had
heard
Boromir
since
went
away
and
watcher
our
borders
had
seen
him
pass
And
the
third
night
after
another
and
stranger
thing
befell
sat
night
the
waters
Anduin
the
grey
dark
under
the
young
pale
moon
watching
the
ever
moving
stream
and
the
sad
reeds
were
rustling
ever
watch
the
shores
nigh
Osgiliath
which
our
enemies
now
partly
hold
and
issue
from
harry
our
lands
But
that
night
all
the
world
slept
the
midnight
hour
Then
saw
seemed
that
saw
boat
floating
the
water
glimmering
grey
small
boat
strange
fashion
with
high
prow
and
there
was
none
row
steer
awe
fell
for
pale
light
was
round
But
rose
and
went
the
bank
and
began
walk
out
into
the
stream
for
was
drawn
towards
Then
the
boat
turned
towards
and
stayed
its
pace
and
floated
slowly
within
hand
reach
yet
durst
not
handle
waded
deep
were
heavily
burdened
and
seemed
passed
under
gaze
that
was
almost
filled
with
clear
water
from
which
came
the
light
and
lapped
the
water
warrior
lay
asleep
broken
sword
was
his
knee
saw
many
wounds
him
was
Boromir
brother
dead
knew
his
gear
his
sword
his
beloved
face
One
thing
only
missed
his
horn
One
thing
only
knew
not
fair
belt
were
linked
golden
leaves
about
his
waist
_Boromir
cried_
Where
thy
horn
Whither
goest
thou
Boromir
But
was
gone
The
boat
turned
into
the
stream
and
passed
glimmering
into
the
night
Dreamlike
was
and
yet
dream
for
there
was
waking
And
not
doubt
that
dead
and
has
passed
down
the
River
the
Sea
Alas
said
Frodo
That
was
indeed
Boromir
knew
him
For
the
golden
belt
was
given
him
Lothlórien
the
Lady
Galadriel
She
was
that
clothed
you
see
elven
grey
This
brooch
the
same
workmanship
touched
the
green
and
silver
leaf
that
fastened
his
cloak
beneath
his
throat
Faramir
looked
closely
beautiful
said
Yes
tis
work
the
same
craft
then
you
passed
through
the
Land
Lórien
Laurelindórenan
was
named
old
but
long
now
has
lain
beyond
the
knowledge
Men
added
softly
regarding
Frodo
with
new
wonder
his
eyes
Much
that
was
strange
about
you
begin
now
understand
Will
you
not
tell
more
For
bitter
thought
that
Boromir
died
within
sight
the
land
his
home
more
can
say
than
have
said
answered
Frodo
Though
your
tale
fills
with
foreboding
vision
was
that
you
saw
think
and
more
some
shadow
evil
fortune
that
has
been
will
Unless
indeed
some
lying
trick
the
Enemy
have
seen
the
faces
fair
warriors
old
laid
sleep
beneath
the
pools
the
Dead
Marshes
seeming
his
foul
arts
Nay
was
not
said
Faramir
For
his
works
fill
the
heart
with
loathing
but
heart
was
filled
with
grief
and
pity
Yet
how
could
such
thing
have
happened
truth
asked
Frodo
For
boat
could
have
been
carried
over
the
stony
hills
from
Tol
Brandir
and
Boromir
purposed
home
across
the
Entwash
and
the
fields
Rohan
And
yet
how
could
any
vessel
ride
the
foam
the
great
falls
and
not
founder
the
boiling
pools
though
laden
with
water
know
not
said
Faramir
But
whence
came
the
boat
From
Lórien
said
Frodo
three
such
boats
rowed
down
Anduin
the
Falls
They
also
were
elven
work
You
passed
through
the
Hidden
Land
said
Faramir
but
seems
that
you
little
understood
its
power
Men
have
dealings
with
the
Mistress
Magic
who
dwells
the
Golden
Wood
then
they
may
look
for
strange
things
follow
For
perilous
for
mortal
man
walk
out
the
world
this
Sun
and
few
old
came
thence
unchanged
tis
said
_Boromir
Boromir
cried
_What
did
she
say
you
the
Lady
that
dies
not
What
did
she
see
What
woke
your
heart
then
Why
went
you
ever
Laurelindórenan
and
came
not
your
own
road
upon
the
horses
Rohan
riding
home
the
morning
Then
turning
again
Frodo
spoke
quiet
voice
once
more
those
questions
guess
that
you
could
make
some
answer
Frodo
son
Drogo
But
not
here
now
maybe
But
lest
you
still
should
think
tale
vision
will
tell
you
this
The
horn
Boromir
least
returned
truth
and
not
seeming
The
horn
came
but
was
cloven
two
were
axe
sword
The
shards
came
severally
shore
one
was
found
among
the
reeds
where
watchers
Gondor
lay
northwards
below
the
infalls
the
Entwash
the
other
was
found
spinning
the
flood
one
who
had
errand
the
water
Strange
chances
but
murder
will
out
tis
said
And
now
the
horn
the
elder
son
lies
two
pieces
upon
the
lap
Denethor
sitting
his
high
chair
waiting
for
news
And
you
can
tell
nothing
the
cleaving
the
horn
did
not
know
said
Frodo
But
the
day
when
you
heard
blowing
your
reckoning
true
was
the
day
when
parted
when
and
servant
left
the
Company
And
now
your
tale
fills
with
dread
For
Boromir
was
then
peril
and
was
slain
must
fear
that
all
companions
perished
too
And
they
were
kindred
and
friends
Will
you
not
put
aside
your
doubt
and
let
weary
and
full
grief
and
afraid
But
have
deed
attempt
before
too
slain
And
the
more
need
haste
two
halflings
are
all
that
remain
our
fellowship
back
Faramir
valiant
Captain
Gondor
and
defend
your
city
while
you
may
and
let
where
doom
takes
For
there
comfort
our
speech
together
said
Faramir
but
you
surely
draw
from
more
dread
than
need
Unless
the
people
Lórien
themselves
came
him
who
arrayed
Boromir
for
funeral
Not
Orcs
servants
the
Nameless
Some
your
Company
guess
live
still
But
whatever
befell
the
North
March
you
Frodo
doubt
longer
hard
days
have
made
any
judge
Men
words
and
faces
then
may
make
guess
Halflings
Though
and
now
smiled
there
something
strange
about
you
Frodo
elvish
air
maybe
But
more
lies
upon
our
words
together
than
thought
first
should
now
take
you
back
Minas
Tirith
answer
there
Denethor
and
life
will
justly
forfeit
now
choose
course
that
proves
ill
for
city
will
not
decide
haste
what
done
Yet
must
move
hence
without
more
delay
sprang
his
feet
and
issued
some
orders
once
the
men
who
were
gathered
round
him
broke
into
small
groups
and
went
off
this
way
and
that
vanishing
quickly
into
the
shadows
the
rocks
and
trees
Soon
only
Mablung
and
Damrod
remained
Now
you
Frodo
and
Samwise
will
come
with
and
guards
said
Faramir
You
cannot
along
the
road
southwards
that
was
your
purpose
will
unsafe
for
some
days
and
always
more
closely
watched
after
this
affray
than
has
been
yet
And
you
cannot
think
far
today
any
case
for
you
are
weary
And
are
are
going
now
secret
place
have
somewhat
less
than
ten
miles
from
here
The
Orcs
and
spies
the
Enemy
have
not
found
yet
and
they
did
could
hold
long
even
against
many
There
may
lie
and
rest
for
while
and
you
with
the
morning
will
decide
what
best
for
and
for
you
There
was
nothing
for
Frodo
but
fall
with
this
request
order
seemed
any
case
wise
course
for
the
moment
since
this
foray
the
men
Gondor
had
made
journey
Ithilien
more
dangerous
than
ever
They
set
out
once
Mablung
and
Damrod
little
ahead
and
Faramir
with
Frodo
and
Sam
behind
Skirting
the
hither
side
the
pool
where
the
hobbits
had
bathed
they
crossed
the
stream
climbed
long
bank
and
passed
into
green
shadowed
woodlands
that
marched
ever
downwards
and
westwards
While
they
walked
swiftly
the
hobbits
could
they
talked
hushed
voices
broke
off
our
speech
together
said
Faramir
not
only
because
time
pressed
Master
Samwise
had
reminded
but
also
because
were
drawing
near
matters
that
were
better
not
debated
openly
before
many
men
was
for
that
reason
that
turned
rather
the
matter
brother
and
let
_Isildur
Bane_
You
were
not
wholly
frank
with
Frodo
told
lies
and
the
truth
all
could
said
Frodo
not
blame
you
said
Faramir
You
spoke
with
skill
hard
place
and
wisely
seemed
But
learned
guessed
more
from
you
than
your
words
said
You
were
not
friendly
with
Boromir
you
did
not
part
friendship
You
and
Master
Samwise
too
guess
have
some
grievance
Now
loved
him
dearly
and
would
gladly
avenge
his
death
yet
knew
him
well
_Isildur
Bane_
would
hazard
that
_Isildur
Bane_
lay
between
you
and
was
cause
contention
your
Company
Clearly
mighty
heirloom
some
sort
and
such
things
not
breed
peace
among
confederates
not
aught
may
learned
from
ancient
tales
not
hit
near
the
mark
Near
said
Frodo
but
not
the
gold
There
was
contention
our
Company
though
there
was
doubt
doubt
which
way
should
take
from
the
Emyn
Muil
But
that
may
ancient
tales
teach
also
the
peril
rash
words
concerning
such
things
heirlooms
then
thought
your
trouble
was
with
Boromir
alone
wished
this
thing
brought
Minas
Tirith
Alas
crooked
fate
that
seals
your
lips
who
saw
him
last
and
holds
from
that
which
long
know
what
was
his
heart
and
thought
his
latest
hours
Whether
erred
this
sure
died
well
achieving
some
good
thing
His
face
was
more
beautiful
even
than
life
But
Frodo
pressed
you
hard
first
about
_Isildur
Bane_
Forgive
was
unwise
such
hour
and
place
had
not
had
time
for
thought
had
had
hard
fight
and
there
was
more
than
enough
fill
mind
But
even
spoke
with
you
drew
nearer
the
mark
and
deliberately
shot
wider
For
you
must
know
that
much
still
preserved
ancient
lore
among
the
Rulers
the
city
that
not
spread
abroad
house
are
not
the
line
Elendil
though
the
blood
Númenor
For
reckon
back
our
line
Mardil
the
good
steward
who
ruled
the
king
stead
when
went
away
war
And
that
was
King
Eärnur
last
the
line
Anárion
and
childless
and
came
never
back
And
the
stewards
have
governed
the
city
since
that
day
though
was
many
generations
Men
ago
And
this
remember
Boromir
boy
when
together
learned
the
tale
our
sires
and
the
history
our
city
that
always
displeased
him
that
his
father
was
not
king
How
many
hundreds
years
needs
make
steward
king
the
king
returns
not
asked
Few
years
maybe
other
places
less
royalty
father
answered
Gondor
ten
thousand
years
would
not
suffice
Alas
poor
Boromir
Does
that
not
tell
you
something
him
does
said
Frodo
Yet
always
treated
Aragorn
with
honour
doubt
not
said
Faramir
were
satisfied
Aragorn
claim
you
say
would
greatly
reverence
him
But
the
pinch
has
not
yet
come
They
had
not
yet
reached
Minas
Tirith
become
rivals
her
wars
But
stray
the
house
Denethor
know
much
ancient
lore
long
tradition
and
there
are
moreover
our
treasuries
many
things
preserved
books
and
tablets
writ
withered
parchments
yea
and
stone
and
leaves
silver
and
gold
divers
characters
Some
none
can
now
read
and
for
the
rest
few
ever
unlock
them
can
read
little
them
for
have
had
teaching
was
these
records
that
brought
the
Grey
Pilgrim
first
saw
him
when
was
child
and
has
been
twice
thrice
since
then
The
Grey
Pilgrim
said
Frodo
Had
name
Mithrandir
called
him
elf
fashion
said
Faramir
and
was
content
_Many
are
names
many
countries_
said
_Mithrandir
among
the
Elves
Tharkûn
the
Dwarves
Olórin
was
youth
the
West
that
forgotten
the
South
Incánus
the
North
Gandalf
the
East
not
Gandalf
said
Frodo
thought
was
Gandalf
the
Grey
dearest
counsellors
Leader
our
Company
was
lost
Moria
Mithrandir
was
lost
said
Faramir
evil
fate
seems
have
pursued
your
fellowship
hard
indeed
believe
that
one
great
wisdom
and
power
for
many
wonderful
things
did
among
could
perish
and
much
lore
taken
from
the
world
Are
you
sure
this
and
that
did
not
just
leave
you
and
depart
where
would
Alas
yes
said
Frodo
saw
him
fall
into
the
abyss
see
that
there
some
great
tale
dread
this
said
Faramir
which
perhaps
you
may
tell
the
evening
time
This
Mithrandir
was
now
guess
more
than
lore
master
great
mover
the
deeds
that
are
done
our
time
Had
been
among
consult
concerning
the
hard
words
our
dream
could
have
made
them
clear
without
need
messenger
Yet
maybe
would
not
have
done
and
the
journey
Boromir
was
doomed
Mithrandir
never
spoke
what
was
nor
did
reveal
his
purposes
got
leave
Denethor
how
not
know
look
the
secrets
our
treasury
and
learned
little
him
when
would
teach
and
that
was
seldom
Ever
would
search
and
would
question
above
all
else
concerning
the
Great
Battle
that
was
fought
upon
Dagorlad
the
beginning
Gondor
when
whom
not
name
was
overthrown
And
was
eager
for
stories
Isildur
though
him
had
less
tell
for
nothing
certain
was
ever
known
among
his
end
Now
Faramir
voice
sank
whisper
But
this
much
learned
guessed
and
have
kept
ever
secret
heart
since
that
Isildur
took
somewhat
from
the
hand
the
Unnamed
ere
went
away
from
Gondor
never
seen
among
mortal
men
again
Here
thought
was
the
answer
Mithrandir
questioning
But
seemed
then
matter
that
concerned
only
the
seekers
after
ancient
learning
Nor
when
the
riddling
words
our
dream
were
debated
among
did
think
_Isildur
Bane_
being
this
same
thing
For
Isildur
was
ambushed
and
slain
orc
arrows
according
the
only
legend
that
knew
and
Mithrandir
had
never
told
more
What
truth
this
Thing
cannot
yet
guess
but
some
heirloom
power
and
peril
must
fell
weapon
perchance
devised
the
Dark
Lord
were
thing
that
gave
advantage
battle
can
well
believe
that
Boromir
the
proud
and
fearless
often
rash
ever
anxious
for
the
victory
Minas
Tirith
and
his
own
glory
therein
might
desire
such
thing
and
allured
Alas
that
ever
went
that
errand
should
have
been
chosen
father
and
the
elders
but
put
himself
forward
being
the
older
and
the
hardier
both
true
and
would
not
stayed
But
fear
more
would
not
take
this
thing
lay
the
highway
Not
were
Minas
Tirith
falling
ruin
and
alone
could
save
her
using
the
weapon
the
Dark
Lord
for
her
good
and
glory
not
wish
for
such
triumphs
Frodo
son
Drogo
Neither
did
the
Council
said
Frodo
Nor
would
have
nothing
with
such
matters
For
myself
said
Faramir
would
see
the
White
Tree
flower
again
the
courts
the
kings
and
the
Silver
Crown
return
and
Minas
Tirith
peace
Minas
Anor
again
old
full
light
high
and
fair
beautiful
queen
among
other
queens
not
mistress
many
slaves
nay
not
even
kind
mistress
willing
slaves
War
must
while
defend
our
lives
against
destroyer
who
would
devour
all
but
not
love
the
bright
sword
for
its
sharpness
nor
the
arrow
for
its
swiftness
nor
the
warrior
for
his
glory
love
only
that
which
they
defend
the
city
the
Men
Númenor
and
would
have
her
loved
for
her
memory
her
ancientry
her
beauty
and
her
present
wisdom
Not
feared
save
men
may
fear
the
dignity
man
old
and
wise
fear
not
not
ask
you
tell
more
not
even
ask
you
tell
whether
now
speak
nearer
the
mark
But
you
will
trust
may
that
can
advise
you
your
present
quest
whatever
that
yes
and
even
aid
you
Frodo
made
answer
Almost
yielded
the
desire
for
help
and
counsel
tell
this
grave
young
man
whose
words
seemed
wise
and
fair
all
that
was
his
mind
But
something
held
him
back
His
heart
was
heavy
with
fear
and
sorrow
and
Sam
were
indeed
seemed
likely
all
that
was
now
left
the
Nine
Walkers
then
was
sole
command
the
secret
their
errand
Better
mistrust
undeserved
than
rash
words
And
the
memory
Boromir
the
dreadful
change
that
the
lure
the
Ring
had
worked
him
was
very
present
his
mind
when
looked
Faramir
and
listened
his
voice
unlike
they
were
and
yet
also
much
akin
They
walked
silence
for
while
passing
like
grey
and
green
shadows
under
the
old
trees
their
feet
making
sound
above
them
many
birds
sang
and
the
sun
glistened
the
polished
roof
dark
leaves
the
evergreen
woods
Ithilien
Sam
had
taken
part
the
conversation
though
had
listened
and
the
same
time
had
attended
with
his
keen
hobbit
ears
all
the
soft
woodland
noises
about
them
One
thing
had
noted
that
all
the
talk
the
name
Gollum
had
not
once
come
was
glad
though
felt
that
was
too
much
hope
that
would
never
hear
again
soon
became
aware
also
that
though
they
walked
alone
there
were
many
men
close
hand
not
only
Damrod
and
Mablung
flitting
and
out
the
shadows
ahead
but
others
either
side
all
making
their
swift
secret
way
some
appointed
place
Once
looking
suddenly
back
some
prickle
the
skin
told
him
that
was
watched
from
behind
thought
caught
brief
glimpse
small
dark
shape
slipping
behind
tree
trunk
opened
his
mouth
speak
and
shut
again
not
sure
said
himself
and
why
should
remind
them
the
old
villain
they
choose
forget
him
wish
could
they
passed
until
the
woodlands
grew
thinner
and
the
land
began
fall
more
steeply
Then
they
turned
aside
again
the
right
and
came
quickly
small
river
narrow
gorge
was
the
same
stream
that
trickled
far
above
out
the
round
pool
now
grown
swift
torrent
leaping
down
over
many
stones
deep
cloven
bed
overhung
with
ilex
and
dark
box
woods
Looking
west
they
could
see
below
them
haze
light
lowlands
and
broad
meads
and
glinting
far
off
the
westering
sun
the
wide
waters
the
Anduin
Here
alas
must
you
discourtesy
said
Faramir
hope
you
will
pardon
one
who
has
far
made
his
orders
give
way
courtesy
not
slay
you
bind
you
But
command
that
stranger
not
even
one
Rohan
that
fights
with
shall
see
the
path
now
with
open
eyes
must
blindfold
you
you
will
said
Frodo
Even
the
Elves
likewise
need
and
blindfolded
crossed
the
borders
fair
Lothlórien
Gimli
the
dwarf
took
ill
but
the
hobbits
endured
place
fair
that
shall
lead
you
said
Faramir
But
glad
that
you
will
take
this
willingly
and
not
force
called
softly
and
immediately
Mablung
and
Damrod
stepped
out
the
trees
and
came
back
him
Blindfold
these
guests
said
Faramir
Securely
but
not
discomfort
them
not
tie
their
hands
They
will
give
their
word
not
try
and
see
could
trust
them
shut
their
eyes
their
own
accord
but
eyes
will
blink
the
feet
stumble
Lead
them
that
they
not
falter
With
green
scarves
the
two
guards
now
bound
the
hobbits
eyes
and
drew
their
hoods
down
almost
their
mouths
then
quickly
they
took
each
one
the
hand
and
went
their
way
All
that
Frodo
and
Sam
knew
this
last
mile
the
road
they
learned
from
guessing
the
dark
After
little
they
found
that
they
were
path
descending
steeply
soon
grew
narrow
that
they
went
single
file
brushing
stony
wall
either
side
their
guards
steered
them
from
behind
with
hands
laid
firmly
their
shoulders
Now
and
again
they
came
rough
places
and
were
lifted
from
their
feet
for
while
and
then
set
down
again
Always
the
noise
the
running
water
was
their
right
hand
and
grew
nearer
and
louder
length
they
were
halted
Quickly
Mablung
and
Damrod
turned
them
about
several
times
and
they
lost
all
sense
direction
They
climbed
upwards
little
seemed
cold
and
the
noise
the
stream
had
become
faint
Then
they
were
picked
and
carried
down
down
many
steps
and
round
corner
Suddenly
they
heard
the
water
again
loud
now
rushing
and
splashing
All
round
them
seemed
and
they
felt
fine
rain
their
hands
and
cheeks
last
they
were
set
their
feet
once
more
For
moment
they
stood
half
fearful
blindfold
not
knowing
where
they
were
and
one
spoke
Then
came
the
voice
Faramir
close
behind
Let
them
see
said
The
scarves
were
removed
and
their
hoods
drawn
back
and
they
blinked
and
gasped
They
stood
wet
floor
polished
stone
the
doorstep
were
rough
hewn
gate
rock
opening
dark
behind
them
But
front
thin
veil
water
was
hung
near
that
Frodo
could
have
put
outstretched
arm
into
faced
westward
The
level
shafts
the
setting
sun
behind
beat
upon
and
the
red
light
was
broken
into
many
flickering
beams
ever
changing
colour
was
they
stood
the
window
some
elven
tower
curtained
with
threaded
jewels
silver
and
gold
and
ruby
sapphire
and
amethyst
all
kindled
with
unconsuming
fire
least
good
chance
came
the
right
hour
reward
you
for
your
patience
said
Faramir
This
the
Window
the
Sunset
Henneth
Annûn
fairest
all
the
falls
Ithilien
land
many
fountains
Few
strangers
have
ever
seen
But
there
kingly
hall
behind
match
Enter
now
and
see
Even
spoke
the
sun
sank
and
the
fire
faded
the
flowing
water
They
turned
and
passed
under
the
low
forbidding
arch
once
they
found
themselves
rock
chamber
wide
and
rough
with
uneven
stooping
roof
few
torches
were
kindled
and
cast
dim
light
the
glistening
walls
Many
men
were
already
there
Others
were
still
coming
twos
and
threes
through
dark
narrow
door
one
side
their
eyes
grew
accustomed
the
gloom
the
hobbits
saw
that
the
cave
was
larger
than
they
had
guessed
and
was
filled
with
great
store
arms
and
victuals
Well
here
our
refuge
said
Faramir
Not
place
great
ease
but
here
you
may
pass
the
night
peace
dry
least
and
there
food
though
fire
one
time
the
water
flowed
down
through
this
cave
and
out
the
arch
but
its
course
was
changed
further
the
gorge
workmen
old
and
the
stream
sent
down
fall
doubled
height
over
the
rocks
far
above
All
the
ways
into
this
grot
were
then
sealed
against
the
entry
water
aught
else
all
save
one
There
are
now
but
two
ways
out
that
passage
yonder
which
you
entered
blindfold

Now
rest

until
the
evening
meal
set
The
hobbits
were
taken
corner
and
given
low
bed
lie
they
wished
Meanwhile
men
busied
themselves
about
the
cave
quietly
and
orderly
quickness
Light
tables
were
taken
from
the
walls
and
set
trestles
and
laden
with
gear
This
was
plain
and
unadorned
for
the
most
part
but
all
well
and
fairly
made
round
platters
bowls
and
dishes

Faramir
went
about
among
the
men
questioning

soft
voice
Some
came
back
from
the
pursuit
the
Southrons
others
left
behind
scouts
near
the
road

All
the
Southrons
had
been
accounted

only
the

none

You

Anborn
Faramir
asked
the

Well

the

Orc

But

saw
something
little
strange
was
getting
deep
dusk
when
the
eyes
make
things
greater
than
they
should
perhaps
may
have
been
more
than
squirrel
Sam
pricked
his
ears
this
Yet
was
black
squirrel
and
saw
tail
Twas
like
shadow
the
ground
and
whisked
behind
tree
trunk
when
drew
nigh
and
went
aloft

any

You
will
not

for

and
seemed
more

arrow
was
too
dark
for

shooting
anyway
and
the
creature
was
gone
into
the
gloom
the

But
stayed
for
while
for
seemed
strange
and
then
hastened
back
thought
heard
the
thing
hiss
from
high
above
turned
away
large

maybe
Perhaps
under

some
the

They

Faramir
But
that

Mirkwood
Ithilien
Sam
fancied
that
gave
swift
glance
towards
the
hobbits
spoke
but
Sam
said
nothing
For
while
and
Frodo
lay
back
and
watched
the
torchlight
and
the
men
moving
and
fro
speaking
hushed
voices
Then
suddenly
Frodo
fell
asleep
Sam
struggled
with
himself
arguing
this
way
and
that
may
all
right
thought
and
then
may
not
Fair

And
what

all
alone
and
all
these

Men
about
Nothing
Sam
Gamgee
but
you
got
keep
awake
all
the
same
And
somehow
managed
The
light
faded
from
the
cave
door
and
the
grey
veil
falling
water
grew
dim
and
was
lost
gathering
shadow
Always
the
sound
the
water
went
never
changing
its
note
morning

night
murmured
and
whispered
sleep
Sam
stuck
his
knuckles
his
eyes
Now
more
torches
were
being
lit
cask
wine
was
broached
Storage
barrels
were
being
opened
Men
were
fetching
water
from
the
fall
Some
were
laving
their
hands
basins
wide
copper
bowl
and
white
cloth
were
brought
Faramir
and
washed
Wake
our
guests
said
and
take
them
water
time
eat
Frodo
sat
and
yawned
and
stretched
Sam
not
used
being
waited
looked
with
some
surprise
the
tall
man
who
bowed
holding
basin
water
before
him
Put
the
ground
master
you
please
said
Easier
for
and
you
Then
the
astonishment
and
amusement
the
Men
plunged
his
head
into
the
cold
water
and
splashed
his
neck
and
ears
the
custom
your
land
wash
the
head
before
supper
said
the
man
who
waited
the
hobbits
before
breakfast
said
Sam
But
you
short
sleep
cold
water
the
neck
like
rain
wilted
lettuce
There
Now
can
keep

long
enough
eat
bit
They
were
led
then
seats
beside
Faramir
barrels
covered
with
pelts
and
high
enough
above
the
benches
the
Men
for
their
convenience
Before
they
ate
Faramir
and
all
his
men
turned
and
faced
west
moment
silence
Faramir
signed
Frodo
and
Sam
that
they
should
likewise
always
said
they
sat
down
look
towards
Númenor
that
was
and
beyond
Elvenhome
that
and
that
which

Elvenhome

will
ever
Have

meat
said
Frodo
feeling
strangely
rustic
and
untutored
But
are
guests
bow
our
host
and
after
have
eaten
rise
and
thank
him
That
also
said
Faramir
After
long
journeying
and
camping
and
days
spent
the
lonely
wild
the
evening
meal
seemed
feast
the
hobbits
drink
pale
yellow
wine
cool
and
fragrant
and
eat
bread
and
butter
and
salted
meats
and
dried
fruits
and
good
red
cheese
with
clean
hands
and
clean
knives
and
plates
Neither
Frodo
nor
Sam
refused
anything
that
was
offered
nor
second
nor
indeed
third
helping
The
wine
coursed
their
veins
and
tired
limbs
and
they
felt
glad
and
easy
heart
they
had
not
done
since
they
left
the
land
Lórien
When
all
was
done
Faramir
led
them
recess
the
back
the
cave
partly
screened
curtains
and
chair
and
two
stools
were
brought
there

earthenware
lamp

You
may
soon
desire
sleep
said
and
especially
good
Samwise
who
would
not
close
his
eyes
before
ate
whether
for
fear
blunting
the
edge
noble
hunger
for
fear
not
know
But
not
good
sleep
too
soon
after
meat
and
that
following
fast
Let
talk
while
your
journey
from
Rivendell
there
must
have
been
many
things
tell
And
you
too
would
perhaps
wish
learn
something
and
the
lands
where
you
now
are
Tell
Boromir
brother
and
old
Mithrandir
and
the
fair
people
Lothlórien
Frodo
longer
felt
sleepy
and
was
willing
talk
But
though
the
food
and
wine
had
put
him
his
ease
had
not
lost
all
his
caution
Sam
was
beaming
and
humming
himself
but
when
Frodo
spoke
was
first
content
listen
only
occasionally
venturing
make
exclamation
agreement
Frodo
told
many
tales
yet
always
steered
the
matter
away
from
the
quest
the
Company
and
from
the
Ring
enlarging
rather
the
valiant
part
Boromir
had
played
all
their
adventures
with
the
wolves
the
wild
the
snows
under
Caradhras
and
the
mines
Moria
where
Gandalf
fell
Faramir
was
most
moved
the
story
the
fight
the
bridge
must
have
irked
Boromir
run
from
Orcs
said
even
from
the
fell
thing
you
name
the
Balrog
even
though
was
the
last
leave
was
the
last
said
Frodo
but
Aragorn
was
forced
lead
alone
knew
the
way
after
Gandalf
fall
But
had
there
not
been
lesser
folk
care
for
not
think
that
either
Boromir
would
have
fled
Maybe
would
have
been
better
had
Boromir
fallen
there
with
Mithrandir
said
Faramir
and
not
gone
the
fate
that
waited
above
the
falls
Rauros
Maybe
But
tell
now
your
own
fortunes
said
Frodo
turning
the
matter
aside
once
again
For
would
learn
more
Minas
Ithil
and
Osgiliath
and
Minas
Tirith
the
long
enduring
What
hope
have
you
for
that
city
your
long
war
What
hope
have
said
Faramir
long
since
had
any
hope
The
sword
Elendil
returns
indeed
may
rekindle
but
not
think
that
will
more
than
put
off
the
evil
day
unless
other
help
unlooked
for
also
comes
from
Elves
Men
For
the
Enemy

and

The
Men
Númenor
were
settled
far
and
wide
the
shores
and
seaward
regions
the
Great
Lands
but
for
the
most
part
they
fell
into
evils
and
follies
Many
became
enamoured
the
Darkness
and
the
black
arts
some
were
given
over
wholly
idleness
and
ease
and
some
fought
among
themselves
until
they
were
conquered
their
weakness
the
wild
men
not
said
that
evil
arts
were
ever
practised
Gondor
that
the
Nameless
One
was
ever
named
honour
there
and
the
old
wisdom
and
beauty
brought
out
the
West
remained
long
the
realm
the
sons
Elendil
the
Fair
and
they
linger
there
still
Yet
even
was
Gondor
that
brought
about
its
own
decay
falling
degrees
into
dotage
and
thinking
that
the
Enemy
was
asleep
who
was
only
banished
not
destroyed
Death
was
ever
present
because
the
Númenoreans
still
they
had
their
old
kingdom
and
lost
hungered
after
endless
life
unchanging
Kings
made
tombs
more
splendid
than
houses
the
living
and
counted
old
names
the
rolls
their
descent
dearer
than
the
names
sons
Childless
lords
sat
aged
halls
musing
heraldry
secret
chambers
withered
men
compounded
strong
elixirs
high
cold
towers
asked
questions
the
stars
And
the
last
king
the
line
Anárion
had
heir
But
the
stewards
were
wiser
and
more
fortunate
Wiser
for
they
recruited
the
strength
our
people
from
the
sturdy
folk
the
sea
coast
and
from
the
hardy
mountaineers
Ered
Nimrais
And
they
made
truce
with
the
proud
peoples
the
North
who
often
had
assailed
men
fierce
valour
but
our
kin
from
afar
off
unlike
the
wild
Easterlings
the
cruel
Haradrim
came

Cirion

Twelfth
Steward
and

that
they
rode

and

These
are

and
ceded
them
the
fields
Calenardhon
that
are
since
called
Rohan
for
that
province
had
long
been
sparsely
peopled
And
they
became
our
allies
and
have
ever
proved
true
aiding
need
and
guarding
our
northern
marches
and
the
Gap
Rohan
our
lore
and
manners
they
have
learned
what
they
would
and
their
lords
speak
our
speech
need
yet
for
the
most
part
they
hold
the
ways
their
own
fathers
and
their
own
memories
and
they
speak
among
themselves
their
own
North
tongue
And
love
them
tall
men
and
fair
women
valiant
both
alike
golden
haired
bright
eyed
and
strong
they
remind
the
youth
Men
they
were
the
Elder
Days
Indeed
said
our
lore
masters
that
they
have
from
old
this
affinity
with
that
they
are
come
from
those
same
Three
Houses
Men
were
the
Númenoreans
their
beginning
not
from
Hador
the
Goldenhaired
the
Elf
friend
maybe
yet
from
such
his
sons
and
people
went
not
over
Sea
into
the
West
refusing
the
call
For
reckon
Men
our
lore
calling
them
the
High
Men
the
West
which
were
Númenoreans
and
the
Middle
Peoples
Men
the
Twilight
such
are
the
Rohirrim
and
their
kin
that
dwell
still
far
the
North
and
the
Wild
the
Men
Darkness
Yet
now
the
Rohirrim
are
grown
some
ways
more
like
enhanced
arts
and
gentleness
too
have
become
more
like
them
and
can
scarce
claim
any
longer
the
title
High
are
become
Middle
Men
the
Twilight
but
with
memory
other
things
For
the
Rohirrim
now
love
war
and
valour
things
good
themselves
both
sport
and
end
and
though
still
hold
that
warrior
should
have
more
skills
and
knowledge
than
only
the
craft

and

esteem
warrior
nonetheless
above

Such
the

for

Faramir
sighed
and
fell
silent
for
while
You
don
say
much
all
your
tales
about
the
Elves
sir
said
Sam
suddenly
plucking
courage
had
noted
that
Faramir
seemed
refer
Elves
with
reverence
and
this
even
more
than
his
courtesy
and
his
food
and
wine
had
won
Sam
respect
and
quieted
his
suspicions
indeed
Master
Samwise
said
Faramir
for
not
learned
Elven
lore
But
there
you
touch
upon
another
point
which
have
changed
declining
from
Númenor
Middle
earth
For
you
may
know
Mithrandir
was
your
companion
and
you
have
spoken
with
Elrond
the
Edain
the
Fathers
the
Númenoreans
fought
beside
the
Elves
the
first
wars
and
were
rewarded
the
gift
the
kingdom
the
midst
the
Sea
within
sight
Elvenhome
But
Middle
earth
Men
and
Elves
became
estranged
the
days
darkness
the
arts
the
Enemy
and
the
slow
changes
time
which
each
kind
walked
further
down
their
sundered
roads
Men
now
fear
and
misdoubt
the
Elves
and
yet
know
little
them
And
Gondor
grow
like
other
Men
like
the
men
Rohan
for
even
they
who
are
the
foes
the
Dark
Lord
shun
the
Elves
and
speak
the
Golden
Wood
with
dread
Yet
there
are
among
still
some
who
have
dealings
with
the
Elves
when
they
may
and
ever
and
anon
one
will

Lórien
seldom
return
Not
For
deem
perilous
now
for
mortal
man
wilfully
seek
out
the
Elder
People
Yet
envy
you
that
have
spoken
with
the
White
Lady
The
Lady
Lórien
Galadriel
cried
Sam
You
should
see
her
indeed
you
should
sir
only
hobbit
and
gardening
job
home
sir
you
understand
and
not
much
good
poetry
not
making
bit
comic
rhyme
perhaps
now
and
again
you
know
but
not
real
poetry
can
tell
you
what
mean
ought
sung
You
have
get
Strider
Aragorn
that
old
Bilbo
for
that
But
wish
could
make
song
about
her
Beautiful
she
sir
Lovely
Sometimes
like
great
tree
flower
sometimes
like
white
daffadowndilly
small
and
slender
like
Hard
monds
soft
moonlight
Warm
sunlight
cold
frost
the
stars
Proud
and
far
off
snow
mountain
and
merry
any
lass
ever
saw
with
daisies
her
hair
springtime
But
that
lot
nonsense
and
all
wide
mark
Then
she
must
lovely
indeed
said
Faramir
Perilously
fair
don
know
about
_perilous_
said
Sam
strikes
that
folk
takes
their
peril
with
them
into
Lórien
and
finds
there
because
they
brought
But
perhaps
you
could
call
her
perilous
because
she
strong
herself
You
you
could
dash
yourself
pieces
her
like
ship
rock
drownd
yourself
like
hobbit
river
But
neither
rock
nor
river
would
blame
Now
Boro
stopped
and
went
red
the
face
Yes
_Now
Boromir_you
would
say
said
Faramir
What
would
you
say
took
his
peril
with
him
Yes
sir
begging
your
pardon
and
fine
man
your
brother
was
may
say
But
you
been
warm
the
scent
all
along
Now
watched
Boromir
and
listened
him
from
Rivendell
all
down
the
road
looking
after
master
you
understand
and
not
meaning
any
harm
Boromir
and
opinion
that
Lórien
first
saw
clearly
what
guessed
sooner
what
wanted
From
the
moment
first
saw
wanted
the
Enemy
Ring
Sam
cried
Frodo
aghast
had
fallen
deep
into
his
own
thoughts
for
while
and
came
out
them
suddenly
and
too
late
Save
said
Sam
turning
white
and
then
flushing
scarlet
There
again
_When
ever
you
open
your
big
mouth
you
put
your
foot
the
Gaffer
used
say
me_
and
right
enough
dear
dear
Now
look
here
sir
turned
facing
Faramir
with
all
the
courage
that
could
muster
Don
you
taking
advantage
master
because
his
servant
better
than
fool
You
spoken
very
handsome
all
along
put
off
guard
talking
Elves
and
all
But
_handsome
handsome
does_
say
Now
chance
show
your
quality
seems
said
Faramir
slowly
and
very
softly
with
strange
smile
that
the
answer
all
the
riddles
The
One
Ring
that
was
thought
have
perished
from
the
world
And
Boromir
tried
take
force
And
you
escaped
And
ran
all
the
way
And
here
the
wild
have
you
two
halflings
and
host
men
call
and
the
Ring
Rings
pretty
stroke

for
Faramir
Captain
Gondor
show
his
quality
stood
very
tall
and
stern
his
grey
eyes
glinting
Frodo
and
Sam
sprang
from
their
stools
and
set
themselves
side
side
with
their
backs
the
wall
fumbling
for
their
sword
hilts
There
was
silence
All
the
men
the
cave
stopped
talking
and
looked
towards
them
wonder
But
Faramir
sat
down
again
his
chair
and
began
laugh
quietly
and
then
suddenly
became
grave
again
Alas
for
Boromir
was
too
sore
trial
said
How
you
have
increased
sorrow
you
two
strange
wanderers
from
far
country
bearing
the
peril
Men
But
you
are
less
judges
Men
than
Halflings
are
truth
speakers
men
Gondor
boast
seldom
and
then
perform
die
the
attempt
Not
found
the
highway

take
it_
said
Even
were
such
man
desire
this
thing
and
even
though
knew
not
clearly
what
this
thing
was
when
spoke
still
should
take
those
words
vow
and
held
them
But
not
such
man
wise
enough
know
that
there
are
some
perils
from
which
man
must
flee
Sit
peace
And
comforted
Samwise
you
seem
have
stumbled
think
that
was
fated
Your
heart
shrewd
well
faithful
and
saw
clearer
than
your
eyes
For
strange
though
may
seem
was
safe
declare
this
may
even
help
the
master
that
you
love
shall
turn
his
good
power
comforted
But
not
even
name
this
thing
again
aloud
Once
enough
The
hobbits
came
back
their
seats
and
sat
very
quiet
Men
turned
back
their
drink
and
their
talk
perceiving
that
their
captain
had
had
some
jest
other
with
the
little
guests
and
that
was
over
Well
Frodo
now
last
understand
one
another
said
Faramir
you
took
this
thing
yourself
unwilling
others
asking
then
you
have
pity
and
honour
from
And
marvel
you
keep
hid
and
not
use
You
are
new
people
and
new
world
Are
all
your
kin
like
sort
Your
land
must
realm
peace
and
content
and
there
must
gardeners
high
honour
Not
all
well
there
said
Frodo
but
certainly
gardeners
are
honoured
But
folk
must
grow
weary
there
even
their
gardens
all
things
under
the
Sun
this
world
And
you
are
far
from
home
and
wayworn
more
tonight
Sleep
both
you
peace
you
can
Fear
not
not
wish
see
touch
know
more
than
know
which
enough
lest
peril
perchance
waylay
and
fall
lower
the
test
than
Frodo
son
Drogo
now
rest
but
first
tell
only
you
will
whither
you
wish
and
what
For
must
watch
and
wait
and
think
Time
passes
the
morning
must
each
swiftly
the
ways
appointed
Frodo
had
felt
himself
trembling
the
first
shock
fear
passed
Now
great
weariness
came
down
him
like
cloud
could
dissemble
and
resist
longer
was
going
find
way
into
Mordor
said
faintly
was
going
Gorgoroth
must
find
the
Mountain
Fire
and
cast
the
thing
into
the
gulf
Doom
Gandalf
said
not
think
shall
ever
get
there
Faramir
stared
him
for
moment
grave
astonishment
Then
suddenly
caught
him
swayed
and
lifting
him
gently
carried
him
the
bed
and
laid
him
there
and
covered
him
warmly
once
fell
into
deep
sleep
Another
bed
was
set
beside
him
for
his
servant
Sam
hesitated
for
moment
then
bowing
very
low
Good
night
Captain
lord
said
You
took
the
chance
sir
Did
said
Faramir
Yes
sir
and
showed
your
quality
the
very
highest
Faramir
smiled
pert
servant
Master
Samwise
But
nay
the
praise
the
praiseworthy
above
all
rewards
Yet
there
was
naught
this
praise
had
lure
desire
other
than
have
done
well
sir
said
Sam
you
said
master
had
elvish
air
and
that
was
good
and
true
But
can
say
this
you
have
air
too
sir
that
reminds
well
Gandalf
wizards
Maybe
said
Faramir
Maybe
you
discern
from
far
away
the
air
Númenor
Good
night
_Chapter
The
Forbidden
Pool
Frodo
woke
find
Faramir
bending
over
him
For
second
old
fears
seized
him
and
sat
and
shrank
away
There
nothing
fear
said
Faramir
morning
already
said
Frodo
yawning
Not
yet
but
night
drawing
end
and
the
full
moon
setting
Will
you
come
and
see
Also
there
matter
which
desire
your
counsel
sorry
rouse
you
from
sleep
but
will
you
come
will
said
Frodo
rising
and
shivering
little
left
the
warm
blanket
and
pelts
seemed
cold
the
fireless
cave
The
noise
the
water
was
loud
the
stillness
put
his
cloak
and
followed
Faramir
Sam
waking
suddenly
some
instinct
watchfulness
saw
first
his
master
empty
bed
and
leapt
his
feet
Then
saw
two
dark
figures
Frodo
and
man
framed
against
the
archway
which
was
now
filled
with
pale
white
light
hurried
after
them
past
rows
men
sleeping
mattresses
along
the
wall
went
the
cave
mouth
saw
that
the
Curtain
was
now
become
dazzling
veil
silk
and
pearls
and
silver
thread
melting
icicles
moonlight
But
did
not
pause
admire
and
turning
aside
followed
his
master
through
the
narrow
doorway
the
wall
the
cave
They
went
first
along
black
passage
then
many
wet
steps
and
came
small
flat
landing
cut
the
stone
and
lit
the
pale
sky
gleaming
high
above
through
long
deep
shaft
From
here
two
flights
steps
led
one
going
seemed
the
high
bank
the
stream
the
other
turning
away
the
left
This
they
followed
wound
its
way
like
turret
stair
last
they
came
out
the
stony
darkness
and
looked
about
They
were
wide
flat
rock
without
rail
parapet
their
right
eastwards
the
torrent
fell
splashing
over
many
terraces
and
then
pouring
down
steep
race
filled
smooth
hewn
channel
with
dark
force
water
flecked
with
foam
and
curling
and
rushing
almost
their
feet
plunged
sheer
over
the
edge
that
yawned
upon
their
left
man
stood
there
near
the
brink
silent
gazing
down
Frodo
turned
watch
the
sleek
necks
the
water
they
curved
and
dived
Then
lifted
his
eyes
and
gazed
far
away
The
world
was
quiet
and
cold
dawn
were
near
Far
off
the
West
the
full
moon
was
sinking
round
and
white
Pale
mists
shimmered
the
great
vale
below
wide
gulf
silver
fume
beneath
which
rolled
the
cool
night
waters
the
Anduin
black
darkness
loomed
beyond
and
glinted
here
and
there
cold
sharp
remote
white
the
teeth
ghosts
the
peaks
Ered
Nimrais
the
White
Mountains
the
Realm
Gondor
tipped
with
everlasting
snow
For
while
Frodo
stood
there
the
high
stone
and
shiver
ran
through
him
wondering
anywhere
the
vastness
the
night
lands
his
old
companions
walked
slept
lay
dead
shrouded
mist
Why
was
brought
here
out
forgetful
sleep
Sam
was
eager
for
answer
the
same
question
and
could
not
refrain
himself
from
muttering
for
his
master
ear
alone
thought
fine
view
doubt
Frodo
but
chilly
the
heart
not
mention
the
bones
What
going
Faramir
heard
and
answered
Moonset
over
Gondor
Fair
Ithil
goes
from
Middle
earth
glances
upon
the
white
locks
old
Mindolluin
worth
few
shivers
But
that
not
what
brought
you
see
though
for
you
Samwise
you
were
not
brought
and
but
pay
the
penalty
your
watchfulness
draught
wine
shall
amend
Come
look
now
stepped
beside
the
silent
sentinel
the
dark
edge
and
Frodo
followed
Sam
hung
back
already
felt
insecure
enough
this
high
wet
platform
Faramir
and
Frodo
looked
down
Far
below
them
they
saw
the
white
waters
pour
into
foaming
bowl
and
then
swirl
darkly
about
deep
oval
basin
the
rocks
until
they
found
their
way
out
again
through
narrow
gate
and
flowed
away
fuming
and
chattering
into
calmer
and
more
level
reaches
The
moonlight
still
slanted
down
the
fall
foot
and
gleamed
the
ripples
the
basin
Presently
Frodo
was
aware
small
dark
thing
the
near
bank
but
even
looked
dived
and
vanished
just
beyond
the
boil
and
bubble
the
fall
cleaving
the
black
water
neatly
arrow
edgewise
stone
Faramir
turned
the
man
his
side
Now
what
would
you
say
that
Anborn
squirrel
kingfisher
Are
there
black
kingfishers
the
night
pools
Mirkwood
Tis
not
bird
whatever
else
answered
Anborn
has
four
limbs
and
dives
manwise
pretty
mastery
the
craft
shows
too
What
Seeking
way
behind
the
Curtain
our
hidings
seems
are
discovered
last
have
bow
here
and
have
posted
other
archers
nigh
good
marksmen
myself
either
bank
wait
only
for
your
command
shoot
Captain
Shall
shoot
said
Faramir
turning
quickly
Frodo
Frodo
did
not
answer
for
moment
Then
said
beg
you
not
Sam
had
dared
would
have
said
Yes
quicker
and
louder
could
not
see
but
guessed
well
enough
from
their
words
what
they
were
looking
You
know
then
what
this
thing
said
Faramir
Come
now
you
have
seen
tell
why
should
spared
all
our
words
together
you
have
not
once
spoken
your
gangrel
companion
and
let
him
for
the
time
could
wait
till
was
caught
and
brought
before
sent
keenest
huntsmen
seek
him
but
slipped
them
and
they
had
sight
him
till
now
save
Anborn
here
once
dusk
yesterevening
But
now
has
done
worse
trespass
than
only
coney
snaring
the
uplands
has
dared
come
Henneth
Annûn
and
his
life
forfeit
marvel
the
creature
secret
and
sly
come
sporting
the
pool
before
our
very
window
Does
think
that
men
sleep
without
watch
all
night
Why
does
There
are
two
answers
think
said
Frodo
For
one
thing
knows
little
Men
and
sly
though
your
refuge
hidden
that
perhaps
does
not
know
that
Men
are
concealed
here
For
another
think
allured
here
mastering
desire
stronger
than
his
caution
lured
here
you
say
said
Faramir
low
voice
Can
does
then
know
your
burden
Indeed
yes
bore
himself
for
many
years
_He_
bore
said
Faramir
breathing
sharply
his
wonder
This
matter
winds
itself
ever
new
riddles
Then
pursuing
Maybe
precious
him
But
did
not
speak
that
What
then
does
the
creature
seek
Fish
said
Frodo
Look
They
peered
down
the
dark
pool
little
black
head
appeared
the
far
end
the
basin
just
out
the
deep
shadow
the
rocks
There
was
brief
silver
glint
and
swirl
tiny
ripples
swam
the
side
and
then
with
marvellous
agility
froglike
figure
climbed
out
the
water
and
the
bank
once
sat
down
and
began
gnaw
the
small
silver
thing
that
glittered
turned
the
last
rays
the
moon
were
now
falling
behind
the
stony
wall
the
pool
end
Faramir
laughed
softly
Fish
said
less
perilous
hunger
maybe
not
fish
from
the
pool
Henneth
Annûn
may
cost
him
all
has
give
Now
have
him
the
arrow
point
said
Anborn
Shall
not
shoot
Captain
For
coming
unbidden
this
place
death
our
law
Wait
Anborn
said
Faramir
This
harder
matter
than
seems
What
have
you
say
now
Frodo
Why
should
spare
The
creature
wretched
and
hungry
said
Frodo
and
unaware
his
danger
And
Gandalf
your
Mithrandir
would
have
bidden
you
not
slay
him
for
that
reason
and
for
others
forbade
the
Elves
not
know
clearly
why
and
what
guess
cannot
speak
openly
out
here
But
this
creature
some
way
bound
with
errand
Until
you
found
and
took
was
guide
Your
guide
said
Faramir
The
matter
becomes
ever
stranger
would
much
for
you
Frodo
but
this
cannot
grant
let
this
sly
wanderer
free
his
own
will
from
here
join
you
later
please
him
caught
Orcs
and
tell
all
knows
under
threat
pain
must
slain
taken
Slain
not
taken
very
swiftly
But
how
can
this
slippery
thing
many
guises
caught
save
feathered
shaft
Let
down
quietly
him
said
Frodo
You
may
keep
your
bows
bent
and
shoot
least
fail
shall
not
run
away
then
and
swift
said
Faramir
comes
off
alive
should
your
faithful
servant
for
the
rest
his
unhappy
days
Lead
Frodo
down
the
bank
Anborn
and
softly
The
thing
has
nose
and
ears
Give
your
bow
Anborn
grunted
and
led
the
way
down
the
winding
stair
the
landing
and
then
the
other
stair
until
last
they
came
narrow
opening
shrouded
with
thick
bushes
Passing
silently
through
Frodo
found
himself
the
top
the
southern
bank
above
the
pool
was
now
dark
and
the
falls
were
pale
and
grey
reflecting
only
the
lingering
moonlight
the
western
sky
could
not
see
Gollum
went
forward
short
way
and
Anborn
came
softly
behind
him
breathed
Frodo
ear
Have
care
your
right
you
fall
the
pool
then
one
but
your
fishing
friend
can
help
you
And
forget
not
that
there
are
bowmen
near
hand
though
you
may
not
see
them
Frodo
crept
forward
using
his
hands
Gollum
like
feel
his
way
and
steady
himself
The
rocks
were
for
the
most
part
flat
and
smooth
but
slippery
halted
listening
first
could
hear
sound
but
the
unceasing
rush
the
fall
behind
him
Then
presently
heard
not
far
ahead
hissing
murmur
Fissh
nice
fissh
White
Face
has
vanished
precious
last
yes
Now
can
eat
fish
peace
not
peace
precious
For
Precious
lost
yes
lost
Dirty
hobbits
nasty
hobbits
Gone
and
left
_gollum_
and
Precious
gone
Only
poor
Sméagol
all
alone
Precious
Nasty
Men
they
take
steal
Precious
Thieves
hates
them
Fissh
nice
fissh
Makes
strong
Makes
eyes
bright
fingers
tight
yes
Throttle
them
precious
Throttle
them
all
yes
gets
chances
Nice
fissh
Nice
fissh
went
almost
unceasing
the
waterfall
only
interrupted
faint
noise
slavering
and
gurgling
Frodo
shivered
listening
with
pity
and
disgust
wished
would
stop
and
that
never
need
hear
that
voice
again
Anborn
was
not
far
behind
could
creep
back
and
ask
him
get
the
huntsmen
shoot
They
would
probably
get
close
enough
while
Gollum
was
gorging
and
off
his
guard
Only
one
true
shot
and
Frodo
would
rid
the
miserable
voice
for
ever
But
Gollum
had
claim
him
now
The
servant
has
claim
the
master
for
service
even
service
fear
They
would
have
foundered
the
Dead
Marshes
but
for
Gollum
Frodo
knew
too
somehow
quite
clearly
that
Gandalf
would
not
have
wished
Sméagol
said
softly
Fissh
nice
fissh
said
the
voice
Sméagol
said
little
louder
The
voice
stopped
Sméagol
Master
has
come
look
for
you
Master
here
Come
Sméagol
There
was
answer
but
soft
hiss
intaken
breath
Come
Sméagol
said
Frodo
are
danger
Men
will
kill
you
they
find
you
here
Come
quickly
you
wish
escape
death
Come
Master
said
the
voice
Not
nice
Master
Leaves
poor
Sméagol
and
goes
with
new
friends
Master
can
wait
Sméagol
hasn
finished
There
time
said
Frodo
Bring
fish
with
you
Come
Must
finish
fish
Sméagol
said
Frodo
desperately
Precious
will
angry
shall
take
Precious
and
shall
say
make
him
swallow
the
bones
and
choke
Never
taste
fish
again
Come
Precious
waiting
There
was
sharp
hiss
Presently
out
the
darkness
Gollum
came
crawling
all
fours
like
erring
dog
called
heel
had
half
eaten
fish
his
mouth
and
another
his
hand
came
close
Frodo
almost
nose
nose
and
sniffed
him
His
pale
eyes
were
shining
Then
took
the
fish
out
his
mouth
and
stood
Nice
Master
whispered
Nice
hobbit
come
back
poor
Sméagol
Good
Sméagol
comes
Now
let
quickly
yes
Through
the
trees
while
the
Faces
are
dark
Yes
come
let
Yes
soon
said
Frodo
But
not
once
will
with
you
promised
promise
again
But
not
now
You
are
not
safe
yet
will
save
you
but
you
must
trust
must
trust
Master
said
Gollum
doubtfully
Why
Why
not
once
Where
the
other
one
the
cross
rude
hobbit
Where
Away
there
said
Frodo
pointing
the
waterfall
not
going
without
him
must
back
him
His
heart
sank
This
was
too
much
like
trickery
did
not
really
fear
that
Faramir
would
allow
Gollum
killed
but
would
probably
make
him
prisoner
and
bind
him
and
certainly
what
Frodo
did
would
seem
treachery
the
poor
treacherous
creature
would
probably
impossible
ever
make
him
understand
believe
that
Frodo
had
saved
his
life
the
only
way
could
What
else
could
keep
faith
near
might
with
both
sides
Come
said
the
Precious
will
angry
are
going
back
now
the
stream
you
front
Gollum
crawled
along
close
the
brink
for
little
way
snuffling
and
suspicious
Presently
stopped
and
raised
his
head
Something
there
said
Not
hobbit
Suddenly
turned
back
green
light
was
flickering
his
bulging
eyes
Masster
masster
hissed
Wicked
Tricksy
False
spat
and
stretched
out
his
long
arms
with
white
snapping
fingers
that
moment
the
great
black
shape
Anborn
loomed
behind
him
and
came
down
him
large
strong
hand
took
him
the
nape
the
neck
and
pinned
him
twisted
round
like
lightning
all
wet
and
slimy
was
wriggling
like
eel
biting
and
scratching
like
cat
But
two
more
men
came
out
the
shadows
Hold
still
said
one
stick
you
full
pins
hedgehog
Hold
still
Gollum
went
limp
and
began
whine
and
weep
They
tied
him
none
too
gently
Easy
easy
said
Frodo
has
strength
match
you
Don
hurt
him
you
can
help
quieter
you
don
Sméagol
They
won
hurt
you
with
you
and
you
shall
come
harm
Not
unless
they
kill
too
Trust
Master
Gollum
turned
and
spat
him
The
men
picked
him
put
hood
over
his
eyes
and
carried
him
off
Frodo
followed
them
feeling
very
wretched
They
went
through
the
opening
behind
the
bushes
and
back
down
the
stairs
and
passages
into
the
cave
Two
three
torches
had
been
lit
Men
were
stirring
Sam
was
there
and
gave
queer
look
the
limp
bundle
that
the
men
carried
Got
him
said
Frodo
Yes
Well
didn
get
him
came
because
trusted
first
afraid
did
not
want
him
tied
like
this
hope
will
all
right
but
hate
the
whole
business
said
Sam
And
nothing
will
ever
all
right
where
that
piece
misery
man
came
and
beckoned
the
hobbits
and
took
them
the
recess
the
back
the
cave
Faramir
was
sitting
there
his
chair
and
the
lamp
had
been
rekindled
its
niche
above
his
head
signed
them
sit
down
the
stools
beside
him
Bring
wine
for
the
guests
said
And
bring
the
prisoner
The
wine
was
brought
and
then
Anborn
came
carrying
Gollum
removed
the
cover
from
Gollum
head
and
set
him
his
feet
standing
behind
him
support
him
Gollum
blinked
hooding
the
malice
his
eyes
with
their
heavy
pale
lids
very
miserable
creature
looked
dripping
and
dank
smelling
fish
still
clutched
one
his
hand
his
sparse
locks
were
hanging
like
rank
weed
over
his
bony
brows
his
nose
was
snivelling
Loose
Loose
said
The
cord
hurts
yes
does
hurts
and
done
nothing
Nothing
said
Faramir
looking
the
wretched
creature
with
keen
glance
but
without
any
expression
his
face
either
anger
pity
wonder
Nothing
Have
you
never
done
anything
worthy
binding
worse
punishment
However
that
not
for
judge
happily
But
tonight
you
have
come
where
death
come
The
fish
this
pool
are
dearly
bought
Gollum
dropped
the
fish
from
his
hand
Don
want
fish
said
The
price
not
set
the
fish
said
Faramir
Only
come
here
and
look
the
pool
bears
the
penalty
death
have
spared
you
far
the
prayer
Frodo
here
who
says
that
him
least
you
have
deserved
some
thanks
But
you
must
also
satisfy
What
your
name
Whence
you
come
And
whither
you
What
your
business
are
lost
lost
said
Gollum
name
business
Precious
nothing
Only
empty
Only
hungry
yes
are
hungry
few
little
fishes
nasty
bony
little
fishes
for
poor
creature
and
they
say
death
wise
they
are
just
very
just
Not
very
wise
said
Faramir
But
just
yes
perhaps
just
our
little
wisdom
allows
Unloose
him
Frodo
Faramir
took
small
nail
knife
from
his
belt
and
handed
Frodo
Gollum
misunderstanding
the
gesture
squealed
and
fell
down
Now
Sméagol
said
Frodo
You
must
trust
will
not
desert
you
Answer
truthfully
you
can
will
you
good
not
harm
cut
the
cords
Gollum
wrists
and
ankles
and
raised
him
his
feet
Come
hither
said
Faramir
Look
you
know
the
name
this
place
Have
you
been
here
before
Slowly
Gollum
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
unwillingly
into
Faramir
All
light
went
out
them
and
they
stared
bleak
and
pale
for
moment
into
the
clear
unwavering
eyes
the
man
Gondor
There
was
still
silence
Then
Gollum
dropped
his
head
and
shrank
down
until
was
squatting
the
floor
shivering
doesn
know
and
doesn
want
know
whimpered
Never
came
here
never
come
again
There
are
locked
doors
and
closed
windows
your
mind
and
dark
rooms
behind
them
said
Faramir
But
this
judge
that
you
speak
the
truth
well
for
you
What
oath
will
you
swear
never
return
and
never
lead
any
living
creature
hither
word
sign
Master
knows
said
Gollum
with
sidelong
glance
Frodo
Yes
knows
will
promise
Master
saves
promise
yes
crawled
Frodo
feet
Save
nice
Master
whined
Sméagol
promises
Precious
promises
faithfully
Never
come
again
never
speak
never
precious
Are
you
satisfied
said
Faramir
Yes
said
Frodo
least
you
must
either
accept
this
promise
carry
out
your
law
You
will
get
more
But
promised
that
came
should
not
harmed
And
would
not
proved
faithless
Faramir
sat
for
moment
thought
Very
good
said
last
surrender
you
your
master
Frodo
son
Drogo
Let
him
declare
what
will
with
you
But
Lord
Faramir
said
Frodo
bowing
you
have
not
yet
declared
your
will
concerning
the
said
Frodo
and
until
that
made
known
cannot
shape
his
plans
for
himself
his
companions
Your
judgement
was
postponed
until
the
morning
but
that
now
hand
Then
will
declare
doom
said
Faramir
for
you
Frodo
far
lies
under
higher
authority
declare
you
free
the
realm
Gondor
the
furthest
its
ancient
bounds
save
only
that
neither
you
nor
any
that
with
you
have
leave
come
this
place
unbidden
This
doom
shall
stand
for
year
and
day
and
then
cease
unless
you
shall
before
that
term
come
Minas
Tirith
and
present
yourself
the
Lord
and
Steward
the
City
Then
will
entreat
him
confirm
what
have
done
and
make
lifelong
the
meantime
whomsoever
you
take
under
your
protection
shall
under
protection
and
under
the
shield
Gondor
Are
you
answered
Frodo
bowed
low
answered
said
and
place
myself
your
service
that
any
worth
one
high
and
honourable
great
worth
said
Faramir
And
now
you
take
this
creature
this
Sméagol
under
your
protection
take
Sméagol
under
protection
said
Frodo
Sam
sighed
audibly
and
not
the
courtesies
which
any
hobbit
would
thoroughly
approved
Indeed
the
Shire
such
matter
would
have
required
great
many
more
words
and
bows
Then
say
you
said
Faramir
turning
Gollum
you
are
under
doom
death
but
while
you
walk
with
Frodo
you
are
safe
for
our
part
Yet
ever
you
found
any
man
Gondor
astray
without
him
the
doom
shall
fall
And
may
death
find
you
swiftly
within
Gondor
without
you
not
well
serve
him
Now
answer
whither
would
you
You
were
his
guide
says
Whither
were
you
leading
him
Gollum
made
reply
This
will
not
have
secret
said
Faramir
Answer
will
reverse
judgement
Still
Gollum
did
not
answer
will
answer
for
him
said
Frodo
brought
the
Black
Gate
asked
but
was
impassable
There
open
gate
into
the
Nameless
Land
said
Faramir
Seeing
this
turned
aside
and
came
the
Southward
road
Frodo
continued
for
said
that
there
there
may
path
near
Minas
Ithil
Minas
Morgul
said
Faramir
not
know
clearly
said
Frodo
but
the
path
climbs
think
into
the
mountains
the
northern
side
that
vale
where
the
old
city
stands
goes
high
cleft
and
down
that
which
beyond
you
know
the
name
that
high
pass
said
Faramir
said
Frodo
called
Cirith
Ungol
Gollum
hissed
sharply
and
began
muttering
himself
not
that
its
name
said
Faramir
turning
him
said
Gollum
and
then
squealed
something
had
stabbed
him
Yes
yes
heard
the
name
once
But
what
does
the
name
matter
Master
says
must
get
must
try
some
way
There
other
way
try
other
way
said
Faramir
How
you
know
that
And
who
has
explored
all
the
confines
that
dark
realm
looked
long
and
thoughtfully
Gollum
Presently
spoke
again
Take
this
creature
away
Anborn
Treat
him
gently
but
watch
him
And
not
you
Sméagol
try
dive
into
the
falls
The
rocks
have
such
teeth
there
would
slay
you
before
your
time
Leave
now
and
take
your
fish
Anborn
went
out
and
Gollum
went
cringing
before
him
The
curtain
was
drawn
across
the
recess
Frodo
think
you
very
unwisely
this
said
Faramir
not
think
you
should
with
this
creature
wicked
not
altogether
wicked
said
Frodo
Not
wholly
perhaps
said
Faramir
but
malice
eats
like
canker
and
the
evil
growing
will
lead
you
good
you
will
part
with
him
will
give
him
safe
conduct
and
guidance
any
point
the
borders
Gondor
that
may
name
would
not
take
said
Frodo
would
follow
after
long
has
done
And
have
promised
many
times
take
him
under
protection
and
where
led
You
would
not
ask
break
faith
with
him
said
Faramir
But
heart
would
For
seems
less
evil
counsel
another
man
break
troth
than
oneself
especially
one
sees
friend
bound
unwitting
his
own
harm
But
will
with
you
you
must
now
endure
him
But
not
think
you
are
holden
Cirith
Ungol
which
has
told
you
less
than
knows
That
much
perceived
clearly
his
mind
not
Cirith
Ungol
Where
then
shall
said
Frodo
Back
the
Black
Gate
and
deliver
myself
the
guard
What
you
know
against
this
place
that
makes
its
name
dreadful
Nothing
certain
said
Faramir
Gondor
not
ever
pass
east
the
Road
these
days
and
none
younger
men
has
ever
done
nor
has
any
set
foot
upon
the
Mountains
Shadow
them
know
only
old
report
and
the
rumour
bygone
days
But
there
some
dark
terror
that
dwells
the
passes
above
Minas
Morgul
Cirith
Ungol
named
old
men
and
masters
lore
will
blanch
and
fall
silent
The
valley
Minas
Morgul
passed
into
evil
very
long
ago
and
was
menace
and
dread
while
the
banished
Enemy
dwelt
yet
far
away
and
Ithilien
was
still
for
the
most
part
our
keeping
you
know
that
city
was
once
strong
place
proud
and
fair
Minas
Ithil
the
twin
sister
our
own
city
But
was
taken
fell
men
whom
the
Enemy
his
first
strength
had
dominated
and
who
wandered
homeless
and
masterless
after
his
fall
said
that
their
lords
were
men
Númenor
who
had
fallen
into
dark
wickedness
them
the
Enemy
had
given
rings
power
and
had
devoured
them
living
ghosts
they
were
become
terrible
and
evil
After
his
going
they
took
Minas
Ithil
and
dwelt
there
and
they
filled
and
all
the
valley
about
with
decay
seemed
empty
and
was
not
for
shapeless
fear
lived
within
the
ruined
walls
Nine
Lords
there
were
and
after
the
return
their
Master
which
they
aided
and
prepared
secret
they
grew
strong
again
Then
the
Nine
Riders
issued
forth
from
the
gates
horror
and
could
not
withstand
them
not
approach
their
citadel
You
will
espied
place
sleepless
malice
full
lidless
eyes
not
that
way
But
where
else
will
you
direct
said
Frodo
You
cannot
yourself
you
say
guide
the
mountains
nor
over
them
But
over
the
mountains
bound
solemn
undertaking
the
Council
find
way
perish
the
seeking
And
turn
back
refusing
the
road
its
bitter
end
where
then
shall
among
Elves
Men
Would
you
have
come
Gondor
with
this
Thing
the
Thing
that
drove
your
brother
mad
with
desire
What
spell
would
work
Minas
Tirith
Shall
there
two
cities
Minas
Morgul
grinning
each
other
across
dead
land
filled
with
rottenness
would
not
have
said
Faramir
Then
what
would
you
have
know
not
Only
would
not
have
you
death
torment
And
not
think
that
Mithrandir
would
have
chosen
this
way
Yet
since
gone
must
take
such
paths
can
find
And
there
time
for
long
searching
said
Frodo
hard
doom
and
hopeless
errand
said
Faramir
But
the
least
remember
warning
beware
this
guide
Sméagol
has
done
murder
before
now
read
him
sighed
Well
meet
and
part
Frodo
son
Drogo
You
have
need
soft
words
not
hope
see
you
again
any
other
day
under
this
Sun
But
you
shall
now
with
blessing
upon
you
and
upon
all
your
people
Rest
little
while
food
prepared
for
you
would
gladly
learn
how
this
creeping
Sméagol
became
possessed
the
Thing
which
speak
and
how
lost
but
will
not
trouble
you
now
ever
beyond
hope
you
return
the
lands
the
living
and
retell
our
tales
sitting
wall
the
sun
laughing
old
grief
you
shall
tell
then
Until
that
time
some
other
time
beyond
the
vision
the
Seeing
stones
Númenor
farewell
rose
and
bowed
low
Frodo
and
drawing
the
curtain
passed
out
into
the
cave
_Chapter
Journey
the
Cross
roads
Frodo
and
Sam
returned
their
beds
and
lay
there
silence
resting
for
little
while
men
bestirred
themselves
and
the
business
the
day
began
After
while
water
was
brought
them
and
then
they
were
led
table
where
food
was
set
for
three
Faramir
broke
his
fast
with
them
had
not
slept
since
the
battle
the
day
before
yet
did
not
look
weary
When
they
had
finished
they
stood
May
hunger
trouble
you
the
road
said
Faramir
You
have
little
provision
but
some
small
store
food
fit
for
travellers
have
ordered
stowed
your
packs
You
will
have
lack
water
you
walk
Ithilien
but
not
drink
any
stream
that
flows
from
Imlad
Morgul
the
Valley
Living
Death
This
also
must
tell
you
scouts
and
watchers
have
all
returned
even
some
that
have
crept
within
sight
the
Morannon
They
all
find
strange
thing
The
land
empty
Nothing
the
road
and
sound
foot
horn
bowstring
anywhere
heard
waiting
silence
broods
above
the
Nameless
Land
not
know
what
this
portends
But
the
time
draws
swiftly
some
great
conclusion
Storm
coming
Hasten
while
you
may
you
are
ready
let
The
Sun
will
soon
rise
above
the
shadow
The
hobbits
packs
were
brought
them
little
heavier
than
they
had
been
and
also
two
stout
staves
polished
wood
shod
with
iron
and
with
carven
heads
through
which
ran
plaited
leathern
thongs
have
fitting
gifts
give
you
our
parting
said
Faramir
but
take
these
staves
They
may
service
those
who
walk
climb
the
wild
The
men
the
White
Mountains
use
them
though
these
have
been
cut
down
your
height
and
newly
shod
They
are
made
the
fair
tree
_lebethron_
beloved
the
woodwrights
Gondor
and
virtue
has
been
set
upon
them
finding
and
returning
May
that
virtue
not
wholly
fail
under
the
Shadow
into
which
you
The
hobbits
bowed
low
Most
gracious
host
said
Frodo
was
said
Elrond
Halfelven
that
should
find
friendship
upon
the
way
secret
and
unlooked
for
Certainly
looked
for
such
friendship
you
have
shown
have
found
turns
evil
great
good
Now
they
made
ready
depart
Gollum
was
brought
out
some
corner
hiding
hole
and
seemed
better
pleased
with
himself
than
had
been
though
kept
close
Frodo
and
avoided
the
glance
Faramir
Your
guide
must
blindfolded
said
Faramir
but
you
and
your
servant
Samwise
release
from
this
you
wish
Gollum
squealed
and
squirmed
and
clutched
Frodo
when
they
came
bind
his
eyes
and
Frodo
said
Blindfold
all
three
and
cover
eyes
first
and
then
perhaps
will
see
that
harm
meant
This
was
done
and
they
were
led
from
the
cave
Henneth
Annûn
After
they
had
passed
the
passages
and
stairs
they
felt
the
cool
morning
air
fresh
and
sweet
about
them
Still
blind
they
went
for
some
little
time
and
then
gently
down
last
the
voice
Faramir
ordered
them
uncovered
They
stood
under
the
boughs
the
woods
again
noise
the
falls
could
heard
for
long
southward
slope
lay
now
between
them
and
the
ravine
which
the
stream
flowed
the
west
they
could
see
light
through
the
trees
the
world
came
there
sudden
end
brink
looking
out
only
sky
Here
the
last
parting
our
ways
said
Faramir
you
take
counsel
you
will
not
turn
eastward
yet
straight
for
thus
you
will
have
the
cover
the
woodland
for
many
miles
your
west
edge
where
the
land
falls
into
the
great
vales
sometimes
suddenly
and
sheer
sometimes
long
hillsides
Keep
near
this
edge
and
the
skirts
the
forest
the
beginning
your
journey
you
may
walk
under
daylight
think
The
land
dreams
false
peace
and
for
while
all
evil
withdrawn
Fare
you
well
while
you
may
embraced
the
hobbits
then
after
the
manner
his
people
stooping
and
placing
his
hands
upon
their
shoulders
and
kissing
their
foreheads
with
the
good
will
all
good
men
said
They
bowed
the
ground
Then
turned
and
without
looking
back
left
them
and
went
his
two
guards
that
stood
little
distance
away
They
marvelled
see
with
what
speed
these
green
clad
men
now
moved
vanishing
almost
the
twinkling
eye
The
forest
where
Faramir
had
stood
seemed
empty
and
drear
dream
had
passed
Frodo
sighed
and
turned
back
southward
mark
his
disregard
all
such
courtesy
Gollum
was
scrabbling
the
mould
the
foot
tree
Hungry
again
already
thought
Sam
Well
now
for
again
Have
they
gone
last
said
Gollum
Nassty
wicked
Men
Sméagol
neck
still
hurts
him
yes
does
Let
Yes
let
said
Frodo
But
you
can
only
speak
ill
those
who
showed
you
mercy
keep
silent
Nice
Master
said
Gollum
Sméagol
was
only
joking
Always
forgives
does
yes
yes
even
nice
Master
little
trickses
yes
nice
Master
nice
Sméagol
Frodo
and
Sam
did
not
answer
Hoisting
their
packs
and
taking
their
staves
hand
they
passed
into
the
woods
Ithilien
Twice
that
day
they
rested
and
took
little
the
food
provided
Faramir
dried
fruits
and
salted
meat
enough
for
many
days
and
bread
enough
last
while
was
still
fresh
Gollum
ate
nothing
The
sun
rose
and
passed
overhead
unseen
and
began
sink
and
the
light
through
the
trees
the
west
grew
golden
and
always
they
walked
cool
green
shadow
and
all
about
them
was
silence
The
birds
seemed
all
have
flown
away
have
fallen
dumb
Darkness
came
early
the
silent
woods
and
before
the
fall
night
they
halted
weary
for
they
had
walked
seven
leagues
more
from
Henneth
Annûn
Frodo
lay
and
slept
away
the
night
the
deep
mould
beneath
ancient
tree
Sam
beside
him
was
more
uneasy
woke
many
times
but
there
was
never
sign
Gollum
who
had
slipped
off
soon
the
others
had
settled
rest
Whether
had
slept
himself
some
hole
nearby
had
wandered
restlessly
prowling
through
the
night
did
not
say
but
returned
with
the
first
glimmer
light
and
roused
his
companions
Must
get
yes
they
must
said
Long
ways
still
south
and
east
Hobbits
must
make
haste
That
day
passed
much
the
day
before
had
gone
except
that
the
silence
seemed
deeper
the
air
grew
heavy
and
began
stifling
under
the
trees
felt
thunder
was
brewing
Gollum
often
paused
sniffing
the
air
and
then
would
mutter
himself
and
urge
them
greater
speed
the
third
stage
their
day
march
drew
and
afternoon
waned
the
forest
opened
out
and
the
trees
became
larger
and
more
scattered
Great
ilexes
huge
girth
stood
dark
and
solemn
wide
glades
with
here
and
there
among
them
hoary
ash
trees
and
giant
oaks
just
putting
out
their
brown
green
buds
About
them
lay
long
launds
green
grass
dappled
with
celandine
and
anemones
white
and
blue
now
folded
for
sleep
and
there
were
acres
populous
with
the
leaves
woodland
hyacinths
already
their
sleek
bell
stems
were
thrusting
through
the
mould
living
creature
beast
bird
was
seen
but
these
open
places
Gollum
grew
afraid
and
they
walked
now
with
caution
flitting
from
one
long
shadow
another
Light
was
fading
fast
when
they
came
the
forest
end
There
they
sat
under
old
gnarled
oak
that
sent
its
roots
twisting
like
snakes
down
steep
crumbling
bank
deep
dim
valley
lay
before
them
its
further
side
the
woods
gathered
again
blue
and
grey
under
the
sullen
evening
and
marched
southwards
the
right
the
Mountains
Gondor
glowed
remote
the
West
under
fire
flecked
sky
the
left
lay
darkness
the
towering
walls
Mordor
and
out
that
darkness
the
long
valley
came
falling
steeply
ever
widening
trough
towards
the
Anduin
its
bottom
ran
hurrying
stream
Frodo
could
hear
its
stony
voice
coming
through
the
silence
and
beside
the
hither
side
road
went
winding
down
like
pale
ribbon
down
into
chill
grey
mists
that
gleam
sunset
touched
There
seemed
Frodo
that
descried
far
off
floating
were
shadowy
sea
the
high
dim
tops
and
broken
pinnacles
old
towers
forlorn
and
dark
turned
Gollum
you
know
where
are
said
Yes
Master
Dangerous
places
This
the
road
from
the
Tower
the
Moon
Master
down
the
ruined
city
the
shores
the
River
The
ruined
city
yes
very
nasty
place
full
enemies
shouldn
have
taken
Men
advice
Hobbits
have
come
long
way
out
the
path
Must
east
now
away
there
waved
his
skinny
arm
towards
the
darkling
mountains
And
can
use
this
road
Cruel
peoples
come
this
way
down
from
the
Tower
Frodo
looked
down
the
road
any
rate
nothing
was
moving
now
appeared
lonely
and
forsaken
running
down
empty
ruins
the
mist
But
there
was
evil
feeling
the
air
things
might
indeed
passing
and
down
that
eyes
could
not
see
Frodo
shuddered
looked
again
the
distant
pinnacles
now
dwindling
into
night
and
the
sound
the
water
seemed
cold
and
cruel
the
voice
Morgulduin
the
polluted
stream
that
flowed
from
the
Valley
the
Wraiths
What
shall
said
have
walked
long
and
far
Shall
look
for
some
place
the
woods
behind
where
can
lie
hidden
good
hiding
the
dark
said
Gollum
day
that
hobbits
must
hide
now
yes
day
come
said
Sam
must
rest
for
bit
even
get
again
the
middle
the
night
There
still
hours
dark
then
time
enough
for
you
take
long
march
you
know
the
way
Gollum
reluctantly
agreed
this
and
turned
back
towards
the
trees
working
eastward
for
while
along
the
straggling
edges
the
wood
would
not
rest
the
ground
near
the
evil
road
and
after
some
debate
they
all
climbed
into
the
crotch
large
holm
oak
whose
thick
branches
springing
together
from
the
trunk
made
good
hiding
place
and
fairly
comfortable
refuge
Night
fell
and
grew
altogether
dark
under
the
canopy
the
tree
Frodo
and
Sam
drank
little
water
and
ate
some
bread
and
dried
fruit
but
Gollum
once
curled
and
went
sleep
The
hobbits
did
not
shut
their
eyes
must
have
been
little
after
midnight
when
Gollum
woke
suddenly
they
were
aware
his
pale
eyes
unlidded
gleaming
them
listened
and
sniffed
which
seemed
they
had
noticed
before
his
usual
method
discovering
the
time
night
Are
rested
Have
had
beautiful
sleep
said
Let
aren
and
haven
growled
Sam
But
must
Gollum
dropped
once
from
the
branches
the
tree
all
fours
and
the
hobbits
followed
more
slowly
soon
they
were
down
they
went
again
with
Gollum
leading
eastwards
the
dark
sloping
land
They
could
see
little
for
the
night
was
now
deep
that
they
were
hardly
aware
the
stems
trees
before
they
stumbled
against
them
The
ground
became
more
broken
and
walking
was
more
difficult
but
Gollum
seemed
way
troubled
led
them
through
thickets
and
wastes
brambles
sometimes
round
the
lip
deep
cleft
dark
pit
sometimes
down
into
black
bush
shrouded
hollows
and
out
again
but
ever
they
went
little
downward
always
the
further
slope
was
longer
and
steeper
They
were
climbing
steadily
their
first
halt
they
looked
back
and
they
could
dimly
perceive
the
roofs
the
forest
they
had
left
behind
lying
like
vast
dense
shadow
darker
night
under
the
dark
blank
sky
There
seemed
great
blackness
looming
slowly
out
the
East
eating
the
faint
blurred
stars
Later
the
sinking
moon
escaped
from
the
pursuing
cloud
but
was
ringed
all
about
with
sickly
yellow
glare
last
Gollum
turned
the
hobbits
Day
soon
said
Hobbits
must
hurry
Not
safe
stay
the
open
these
places
Make
haste
quickened
his
pace
and
they
followed
him
wearily
Soon
they
began
climb
great
hog
back
land
For
the
most
part
was
covered
with
thick
growth
gorse
and
whortleberry
and
low
tough
thorns
though
here
and
there
clearings
opened
the
scars
recent
fires
The
gorse
bushes
became
more
frequent
they
got
nearer
the
top
very
old
and
tall
they
were
gaunt
and
leggy
below
but
thick
above
and
already
putting
out
yellow
flowers
that
glimmered
the
gloom
and
gave
faint
sweet
scent
tall
were
the
spiny
thickets
that
the
hobbits
could
walk
upright
under
them
passing
through
long
dry
aisles
carpeted
with
deep
prickly
mould
the
further
edge
this
broad
hill
back
they
stayed
their
march
and
crawled
for
hiding
underneath
tangled
knot
thorns
Their
twisted
boughs
stooping
the
ground
were
overridden
clambering
maze
old
briars
Deep
inside
there
was
hollow
hall
raftered
with
dead
branch
and
bramble
and
roofed
with
the
first
leaves
and
shoots
spring
There
they
lay
for
while
too
tired
yet
eat
and
peering
out
through
the
holes
the
covert
they
watched
for
the
slow
growth
day
But
day
came
only
dead
brown
twilight
the
East
there
was
dull
red
glare
under
the
lowering
cloud
was
not
the
red
dawn
Across
the
tumbled
lands
between
the
mountains
the
Ephel
Dúath
frowned
them
black
and
shapeless
below
where
night
lay
thick
and
did
not
pass
away
above
with
jagged
tops
and
edges
outlined
hard
and
menacing
against
the
fiery
glow
Away
their
right
great
shoulder
the
mountains
stood
out
dark
and
black
amid
the
shadows
thrusting
westward
Which
way
from
here
asked
Frodo
that
the
opening
the
Morgul
Valley
away
over
there
beyond
that
black
mass
Need
think
about
yet
said
Sam
Surely
not
going
move
any
more
today
day
Perhaps
not
perhaps
not
said
Gollum
But
must
soon
the
Cross
roads
Yes
the
Cross
roads
That
the
way
over
there
yes
Master
The
red
glare
over
Mordor
died
away
The
twilight
deepened
great
vapours
rose
the
East
and
crawled
above
them
Frodo
and
Sam
took
little
food
and
then
lay
down
but
Gollum
was
restless
would
not
eat
any
their
food
but
drank
little
water
and
then
crawled
about
under
the
bushes
sniffing
and
muttering
Then
suddenly
disappeared
Off
hunting
suppose
said
Sam
and
yawned
was
his
turn
sleep
first
and
was
soon
deep
dream
thought
was
back
the
Bag
End
garden
looking
for
something
but
had
heavy
pack
his
back
which
made
him
stoop
all
seemed
very
weedy
and
rank
somehow
and
thorns
and
bracken
were
invading
the
beds
down
near
the
bottom
hedge
job
work
for
can
see
but
tired
kept
saying
Presently
remembered
what
was
looking
for
pipe
said
and
with
that
woke
Silly
said
himself
opened
his
eyes
and
wondered
why
was
lying
down
under
the
hedge
your
pack
all
the
time
Then
realized
first
that
the
pipe
might
his
pack
but
had
leaf
and
next
that
was
hundreds
miles
from
Bag
End
sat
seemed
almost
dark
Why
had
his
master
let
him
sleep
out
turn
right
till
evening
Haven
you
had
sleep
Frodo
said
What
the
time
Seems
getting
late
isn
said
Frodo
But
the
day
getting
darker
instead
lighter
darker
and
darker
far
can
tell
isn
midday
yet
and
you
only
slept
for
about
three
hours
wonder
what
said
Sam
there
storm
coming
going
the
worst
there
ever
was
shall
wish
were
down
deep
hole
not
just
stuck
under
hedge
listened
What
that
Thunder
drums
what
don
know
said
Frodo
been
going
for
good
while
now
Sometimes
the
ground
seems
tremble
sometimes
seems
the
heavy
air
throbbing
your
ears
Sam
looked
round
Where
Gollum
said
Hasn
come
back
yet
said
Frodo
There
not
been
sign
sound
him
Well
can
abide
him
said
Sam
fact
never
taken
anything
journey
that
have
been
less
sorry
lose
the
way
But
would
just
like
him
after
coming
all
these
miles
and
get
lost
now
just
when
shall
need
him
most
that
ever
going
any
use
which
doubt
You
forget
the
Marshes
said
Frodo
hope
nothing
has
happened
him
And
hope
tricks
And
anyway
hope
doesn
fall
into
other
hands
you
might
say
Because
does
shall
soon
for
trouble
that
moment
rolling
and
rumbling
noise
was
heard
again
louder
now
and
deeper
The
ground
seemed
quiver
under
their
feet
think
are
for
trouble
anyhow
said
Frodo
afraid
our
journey
drawing
end
Maybe
said
Sam
but
_where
there
life
there
hope_
Gaffer
used
say
_and
need
vittles_
mostways
used
add
You
have
bite
Frodo
and
then
bit
sleep
The
afternoon
Sam
supposed
must
called
wore
Looking
out
from
the
covert
could
see
only
dun
shadowless
world
fading
slowly
into
featureless
colourless
gloom
felt
stifling
but
not
warm
Frodo
slept
unquietly
turning
and
tossing
and
sometimes
murmuring
Twice
Sam
thought
heard
him
speaking
Gandalf
name
The
time
seemed
drag
interminably
Suddenly
Sam
heard
hiss
behind
him
and
there
was
Gollum
all
fours
peering
them
with
gleaming
eyes
Wake
wake
Wake
sleepies
whispered
Wake
time
lose
must
yes
must
once
time
lose
Sam
stared
him
suspiciously
seemed
frightened
excited
now
What
your
little
game
isn
time
yet
can
tea
time
even
leastways
not
decent
places
where
there
tea
time
Silly
hissed
Gollum
not
decent
places
Time
running
short
yes
running
fast
time
lose
must
Wake
Master
wake
clawed
Frodo
and
Frodo
startled
out
sleep
sat
suddenly
and
seized
him
the
arm
Gollum
tore
himself
loose
and
backed
away
They
mustn
silly
hissed
must
time
lose
And
nothing
more
could
they
get
out
him
Where
had
been
and
what
thought
was
brewing
make
him
such
hurry
would
not
say
Sam
was
filled
with
deep
suspicion
and
showed
but
Frodo
gave
sign
what
was
passing
his
mind
sighed
hoisted
his
pack
and
prepared
out
into
the
ever
gathering
darkness
Very
stealthily
Gollum
led
them
down
the
hillside
keeping
under
cover
wherever
was
possible
and
running
almost
bent
the
ground
across
any
open
space
but
the
light
was
now
dim
that
even
keen
eyed
beast
the
wild
could
scarcely
have
seen
the
hobbits
hooded
their
grey
cloaks
nor
heard
them
walking
warily
the
little
people
can
Without
the
crack
twig
the
rustle
leaf
they
passed
and
vanished
For
about
hour
they
went
silently
single
file
oppressed
the
gloom
and
the
absolute
stillness
the
land
broken
only
now
and
again
the
faint
rumbling
thunder
far
away
drum
beats
some
hollow
the
hills
Down
from
their
hiding
place
they
went
and
then
turning
south
they
steered
straight
course
Gollum
could
find
across
long
broken
slope
that
leaned
towards
the
mountains
Presently
not
far
ahead
looming
like
black
wall
they
saw
belt
trees
they
drew
nearer
they
became
aware
that
these
were
vast
size
very
ancient
seemed
and
still
towering
high
though
their
tops
were
gaunt
and
broken
tempest
and
lightning
blast
had
swept
across
them
but
had
failed
kill
them
shake
their
fathomless
roots
The
Cross
roads
yes
whispered
Gollum
the
first
words
that
had
been
spoken
since
they
left
their
hiding
place
must
that
way
Turning
eastward
now
led
them
the
slope
and
then
suddenly
there
was
before
them
the
Southward
Road
winding
its
way
about
the
outer
feet
the
mountains
until
presently
plunged
into
the
great
ring
trees
This
the
only
way
whispered
Gollum
paths
beyond
the
road
paths
must
the
Cross
roads
But
make
haste
silent
furtively
scouts
within
the
campment
their
enemies
they
crept
down
the
road
and
stole
along
its
westward
edge
under
the
stony
bank
grey
the
stones
themselves
and
soft
footed
hunting
cats
length
they
reached
the
trees
and
found
that
they
stood
great
roofless
ring
open
the
middle
the
sombre
sky
and
the
spaces
between
their
immense
boles
were
like
the
great
dark
arches
some
ruined
hall
the
very
centre
four
ways
met
Behind
them
lay
the
road
the
Morannon
before
them
ran
out
again
upon
its
long
journey
south
their
right
the
road
from
old
Osgiliath
came
climbing
and
crossing
passed
out
eastward
into
darkness
the
fourth
way
the
road
they
were
take
Standing
there
for
moment
filled
with
dread
Frodo
became
aware
that
light
was
shining
saw
glowing
Sam
face
beside
him
Turning
towards
saw
beyond
arch
boughs
the
road
Osgiliath
running
almost
straight
stretched
ribbon
down
down
into
the
West
There
far
away
beyond
sad
Gondor
now
overwhelmed
shade
the
Sun
was
sinking
finding
last
the
hem
the
great
slow
rolling
pall
cloud
and
falling
ominous
fire
towards
the
yet
unsullied
Sea
The
brief
glow
fell
upon
huge
sitting
figure
still
and
solemn
the
great
stone
kings
Argonath
The
years
had
gnawed
and
violent
hands
had
maimed
Its
head
was
gone
and
its
place
was
set
mockery
round
rough
hewn
stone
rudely
painted
savage
hands
the
likeness
grinning
face
with
one
large
red
eye
the
midst
its
forehead
Upon
its
knees
and
mighty
chair
and
all
about
the
pedestal
were
idle
scrawls
mixed
with
the
foul
symbols
that
the
maggot
folk
Mordor
used
Suddenly
caught
the
level
beams
Frodo
saw
the
old
king
head
was
lying
rolled
away
the
roadside
Look
Sam
cried
startled
into
speech
Look
The
king
has
got
crown
again
The
eyes
were
hollow
and
the
carven
beard
was
broken
but
about
the
high
stern
forehead
there
was
coronal
silver
and
gold
trailing
plant
with
flowers
like
small
white
stars
had
bound
itself
across
the
brows
reverence
for
the
fallen
king
and
the
crevices
his
stony
hair
yellow
stonecrop
gleamed
They
cannot
conquer
for
ever
said
Frodo
And
then
suddenly
the
brief
glimpse
was
gone
The
Sun
dipped
and
vanished
and
the
shuttering
lamp
black
night
fell
_Chapter
The
Stairs
Cirith
Ungol
Gollum
was
tugging
Frodo
cloak
and
hissing
with
fear
and
impatience
must
said
mustn
stand
here
Make
haste
Reluctantly
Frodo
turned
his
back
the
West
and
followed
his
guide
led
him
out
into
the
darkness
the
East
They
left
the
ring
trees
and
crept
along
the
road
towards
the
mountains
This
road
too
ran
straight
for
while
but
soon
began
bend
away
southwards
until
came
right
under
the
great
shoulder
rock
that
they
had
seen
from
the
distance
Black
and
forbidding
loomed
above
them
darker
than
the
dark
sky
behind
Crawling
under
its
shadow
the
road
went
and
rounding
sprang
east
again
and
began
climb
steeply
Frodo
and
Sam
were
plodding
along
with
heavy
hearts
longer
able
care
greatly
about
their
peril
Frodo
head
was
bowed
his
burden
was
dragging
him
down
again
soon
the
great
Cross
roads
had
been
passed
the
weight
almost
forgotten
Ithilien
had
begun
grow
once
more
Now
feeling
the
way
become
steep
before
his
feet
looked
wearily
and
then
saw
even
Gollum
had
said
that
would
the
city
the
Ringwraiths
cowered
against
the
stony
bank
long
tilted
valley
deep
gulf
shadow
ran
back
far
into
the
mountains
Upon
the
further
side
some
way
within
the
valley
arms
high
rocky
seat
upon
the
black
knees
the
Ephel
Dúath
stood
the
walls
and
tower
Minas
Morgul
All
was
dark
about
earth
and
sky
but
was
lit
with
light
Not
the
imprisoned
moonlight
welling
through
the
marble
walls
Minas
Ithil
long
ago
Tower
the
Moon
fair
and
radiant
the
hollow
the
hills
Paler
indeed
than
the
moon
ailing
some
slow
eclipse
was
the
light
now
wavering
and
blowing
like
noisome
exhalation
decay
corpse
light
light
that
illuminated
nothing
the
walls
and
tower
windows
showed
like
countless
black
holes
looking
inward
into
emptiness
but
the
topmost
course
the
tower
revolved
slowly
first
one
way
and
then
another
huge
ghostly
head
leering
into
the
night
For
moment
the
three
companions
stood
there
shrinking
staring
with
unwilling
eyes
Gollum
was
the
first
recover
Again
pulled
their
cloaks
urgently
but
spoke
word
Almost
dragged
them
forward
Every
step
was
reluctant
and
time
seemed
slow
its
pace
that
between
the
raising
foot
and
the
setting
down
minutes
loathing
passed
they
came
slowly
the
white
bridge
Here
the
road
gleaming
faintly
passed
over
the
stream
the
midst
the
valley
and
went
winding
deviously
towards
the
city
gate
black
mouth
opening
the
outer
circle
the
northward
walls
Wide
flats
lay
either
bank
shadowy
meads
filled
with
pale
white
flowers
Luminous
these
were
too
beautiful
and
yet
horrible
shape
like
the
demented
forms
uneasy
dream
and
they
gave
forth
faint
sickening
charnel
smell
odour
rottenness
filled
the
air
From
mead
mead
the
bridge
sprang
Figures
stood
there
its
head
carven
with
cunning
forms
human
and
bestial
but
all
corrupt
and
loathsome
The
water
flowing
beneath
was
silent
and
steamed
but
the
vapour
that
rose
from
curling
and
twisting
about
the
bridge
was
deadly
cold
Frodo
felt
his
senses
reeling
and
his
mind
darkening
Then
suddenly
some
force
were
work
other
than
his
own
will
began
hurry
tottering
forward
his
groping
hands
held
out
his
head
lolling
from
side
side
Both
Sam
and
Gollum
ran
after
him
Sam
caught
his
master
his
arms
stumbled
and
almost
fell
right
the
threshold
the
bridge
Not
that
way
not
that
way
whispered
Gollum
but
the
breath
between
his
teeth
seemed
tear
the
heavy
stillness
like
whistle
and
cowered
the
ground
terror
Hold
Frodo
muttered
Sam
Frodo
ear
Come
back
Not
that
way
Gollum
says
not
and
for
once
agree
with
him
Frodo
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
and
wrenched
his
eyes
away
from
the
city
the
hill
The
luminous
tower
fascinated
him
and
fought
the
desire
that
was
him
run
the
gleaming
road
towards
its
gate
last
with
effort
turned
back
and
did
felt
the
Ring
resisting
him
dragging
the
chain
about
his
neck
and
his
eyes
too
looked
away
seemed
for
the
moment
have
been
blinded
The
darkness
before
him
was
impenetrable
Gollum
crawling
the
ground
like
frightened
animal
was
already
vanishing
into
the
gloom
Sam
supporting
and
guiding
his
stumbling
master
followed
after
him
quickly
could
Not
far
from
the
near
bank
the
stream
there
was
gap
the
stone
wall
beside
the
road
Through
this
they
passed
and
Sam
saw
that
they
were
narrow
path
that
gleamed
faintly
first
the
main
road
did
until
climbing
above
the
meads
deadly
flowers
faded
and
went
dark
winding
its
crooked
way
into
the
northern
sides
the
valley
Along
this
path
the
hobbits
trudged
side
side
unable
see
Gollum
front
them
except
when
turned
back
beckon
them
Then
his
eyes
shone
with
green
white
light
reflecting
the
noisome
Morgul
sheen
perhaps
kindled
some
answering
mood
within
that
deadly
gleam
and
the
dark
eyeholes
Frodo
and
Sam
were
always
conscious
ever
glancing
fearfully
over
their
shoulders
and
ever
dragging
their
eyes
back
find
the
darkening
path
Slowly
they
laboured
they
rose
above
the
stench
and
vapours
the
poisonous
stream
their
breath
became
easier
and
their
heads
clearer
but
now
their
limbs
were
deadly
tired
they
had
walked
all
night
under
burden
had
been
swimming
long
against
heavy
tide
water
last
they
could
further
without
halt
Frodo
stopped
and
sat
down
stone
They
had
now
climbed
the
top
great
hump
bare
rock
Ahead
them
there
was
bay
the
valley
side
and
round
the
head
this
the
path
went
more
than
wide
ledge
with
chasm
the
right
across
the
sheer
southward
face
the
mountain
crawled
upwards
until
disappeared
into
the
blackness
above
must
rest
while
Sam
whispered
Frodo
heavy
Sam
lad
very
heavy
wonder
how
far
can
carry
Anyway
must
rest
before
venture
that
pointed
the
narrow
way
ahead
Sssh
ssh
hissed
Gollum
hurrying
back
them
Sssh
His
fingers
were
his
lips
and
shook
his
head
urgently
Tugging
Frodo
sleeve
pointed
towards
the
path
but
Frodo
would
not
move
Not
yet
said
not
yet
Weariness
and
more
than
weariness
oppressed
him
seemed
heavy
spell
was
laid
his
mind
and
body
must
rest
muttered
this
Gollum
fear
and
agitation
became
great
that
spoke
again
hissing
behind
his
hand
keep
the
sound
from
unseen
listeners
the
air
Not
here
Not
rest
here
Fools
Eyes
can
see
When
they
come
the
bridge
they
will
see
Come
away
Climb
climb
Come
Come
Frodo
said
Sam
right
again
can
stay
here
All
right
said
Frodo
remote
voice
one
speaking
half
asleep
will
try
Wearily
got
his
feet
But
was
too
late
that
moment
the
rock
quivered
and
trembled
beneath
them
The
great
rumbling
noise
louder
than
ever
before
rolled
the
ground
and
echoed
the
mountains
Then
with
searing
suddenness
there
came
great
red
flash
Far
beyond
the
eastern
mountains
leapt
into
the
sky
and
splashed
the
lowering
clouds
with
crimson
that
valley
shadow
and
cold
deathly
light
seemed
unbearably
violent
and
fierce
Peaks
stone
and
ridges
like
notched
knives
sprang
out
staring
black
against
the
uprushing
flame
Gorgoroth
Then
came
great
crack
thunder
And
Minas
Morgul
answered
There
was
flare
livid
lightnings
forks
blue
flame
springing
from
the
tower
and
from
the
encircling
hills
into
the
sullen
clouds
The
earth
groaned
and
out
the
city
there
came
cry
Mingled
with
harsh
high
voices
birds
prey
and
the
shrill
neighing
horses
wild
with
rage
and
fear
there
came
rending
screech
shivering
rising
swiftly
piercing
pitch
beyond
the
range
hearing
The
hobbits
wheeled
round
towards
and
cast
themselves
down
holding
their
hands
upon
their
ears
the
terrible
cry
ended
falling
back
through
long
sickening
wail
silence
Frodo
slowly
raised
his
head
Across
the
narrow
valley
now
almost
level
with
his
eyes
the
walls
the
evil
city
stood
and
its
cavernous
gate
shaped
like
open
mouth
with
gleaming
teeth
was
gaping
wide
And
out
the
gate
army
came
All
that
host
was
clad
sable
dark
the
night
Against
the
wan
walls
and
the
luminous
pavement
the
road
Frodo
could
see
them
small
black
figures
rank
upon
rank
marching
swiftly
and
silently
passing
outwards
endless
stream
Before
them
went
great
cavalry
horsemen
moving
like
ordered
shadows
and
their
head
was
one
greater
than
all
the
rest
Rider
all
black
save
that
his
hooded
head
had
helm
like
crown
that
flickered
with
perilous
light
Now
was
drawing
near
the
bridge
below
and
Frodo
staring
eyes
followed
him
unable
wink
withdraw
Surely
there
was
the
Lord
the
Nine
Riders
returned
earth
lead
his
ghastly
host
battle
Here
yes
here
indeed
was
the
haggard
king
whose
cold
hand
had
smitten
down
the
Ring
bearer
with
his
deadly
knife
The
old
wound
throbbed
with
pain
and
great
chill
spread
towards
Frodo
heart
Even
these
thoughts
pierced
him
with
dread
and
held
him
bound
with
spell
the
Rider
halted
suddenly
right
before
the
entrance
the
bridge
and
behind
him
all
the
host
stood
still
There
was
pause
dead
silence
Maybe
was
the
Ring
that
called
the
Wraith
lord
and
for
moment
was
troubled
sensing
some
other
power
within
his
valley
This
way
and
that
turned
the
dark
head
helmed
and
crowned
with
fear
sweeping
the
shadows
with
its
unseen
eyes
Frodo
waited
like
bird
the
approach
snake
unable
move
And
waited
felt
more
urgent
than
ever
before
the
command
that
should
put
the
Ring
But
great
the
pressure
was
felt
inclination
now
yield
knew
that
the
Ring
would
only
betray
him
and
that
had
not
even
put
the
power
face
the
Morgul
king
not
yet
There
was
longer
any
answer
that
command
his
own
will
dismayed
terror
though
was
and
felt
only
the
beating
upon
him
great
power
from
outside
took
his
hand
and
Frodo
watched
with
his
mind
not
willing
but
suspense
looked
some
old
story
far
away
moved
the
hand
inch
inch
towards
the
chain
upon
his
neck
Then
his
own
will
stirred
slowly
forced
the
hand
back
and
set
find
another
thing
thing
lying
hidden
near
his
breast
Cold
and
hard
seemed
his
grip
closed
the
phial
Galadriel
long
treasured
and
almost
forgotten
till
that
hour
touched
for
while
all
thought
the
Ring
was
banished
from
his
mind
sighed
and
bent
his
head
that
moment
the
Wraith
king
turned
and
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
across
the
bridge
and
all
his
dark
host
followed
him
Maybe
the
elven
hoods
defied
his
unseen
eyes
and
the
mind
his
small
enemy
being
strengthened
had
turned
aside
his
thought
But
was
haste
Already
the
hour
had
struck
and
his
great
Master
bidding
must
march
with
war
into
the
West
Soon
had
passed
like
shadow
into
shadow
down
the
winding
road
and
behind
him
still
the
black
ranks
crossed
the
bridge
great
army
had
never
issued
from
that
vale
since
the
days
Isildur
might
host
fell
and
strong
arms
had
yet
assailed
the
fords
Anduin
and
yet
was
but
one
and
not
the
greatest
the
hosts
that
Mordor
now
sent
forth
Frodo
stirred
And
suddenly
his
heart
went
out
Faramir
The
storm
has
burst
last
thought
This
great
array
spears
and
swords
going
Osgiliath
Will
Faramir
get
across
time
guessed
but
did
know
the
hour
And
who
can
now
hold
the
fords
when
the
King
the
Nine
Riders
comes
And
other
armies
will
come
too
late
All
lost
tarried
the
way
All
lost
Even
errand
performed
one
will
ever
know
There
will
one
can
tell
will
vain
Overcome
with
weakness
wept
And
still
the
host
Morgul
crossed
the
bridge
Then
great
distance
came
out
memories
the
Shire
some
sunlit
early
morning
when
the
day
called
and
doors
were
opening
heard
Sam
voice
speaking
Wake
Frodo
Wake
Had
the
voice
added
Your
breakfast
ready
would
hardly
have
been
surprised
Certainly
Sam
was
urgent
Wake
Frodo
They
gone
said
There
was
dull
clang
The
gates
Minas
Morgul
had
closed
The
last
rank
spears
had
vanished
down
the
road
The
tower
still
grinned
across
the
valley
but
the
light
was
fading
The
whole
city
was
falling
back
into
dark
brooding
shade
and
silence
Yet
still
was
filled
with
watchfulness
Wake
Frodo
They
gone
and
better
too
There
something
still
alive
that
place
something
with
eyes
seeing
mind
you
take
and
the
longer
stay
one
spot
the
sooner
will
get
Come
Frodo
Frodo
raised
his
head
and
then
stood
Despair
had
not
left
him
but
the
weakness
had
passed
even
smiled
grimly
feeling
now
clearly
moment
before
had
felt
the
opposite
that
what
had
had
could
and
that
whether
Faramir
Aragorn
Elrond
Galadriel
Gandalf
anyone
else
ever
knew
about
was
beside
the
purpose
took
his
staff
one
hand
and
the
phial
his
other
When
saw
that
the
clear
light
was
already
welling
through
his
fingers
thrust
into
his
bosom
and
held
against
his
heart
Then
turning
from
the
city
Morgul
now
more
than
grey
glimmer
across
dark
gulf
prepared
take
the
upward
road
Gollum
seemed
had
crawled
off
along
the
ledge
into
the
darkness
beyond
when
the
gates
Minas
Morgul
opened
leaving
the
hobbits
where
they
lay
now
came
creeping
back
his
teeth
chattering
and
his
fingers
snapping
Foolish
Silly
hissed
Make
haste
They
mustn
think
danger
has
passed
hasn
Make
haste
They
did
not
answer
but
they
followed
him
the
climbing
ledge
was
little
the
liking
either
them
not
even
after
facing
many
other
perils
but
did
not
last
long
Soon
the
path
reached
rounded
angle
where
the
mountain
side
swelled
out
again
and
there
suddenly
entered
narrow
opening
the
rock
They
had
come
the
first
stair
that
Gollum
had
spoken
The
darkness
was
almost
complete
and
they
could
see
nothing
much
beyond
their
hands
stretch
but
Gollum
eyes
shone
pale
several
feet
above
turned
back
towards
them
Careful
whispered
Steps
Lots
steps
Must
careful
Care
was
certainly
needed
Frodo
and
Sam
first
felt
easier
having
now
wall
either
side
but
the
stairway
was
almost
steep
ladder
and
they
climbed
and
they
became
more
and
more
aware
the
long
black
fall
behind
them
And
the
steps
were
narrow
spaced
unevenly
and
often
treacherous
they
were
worn
and
smooth
the
edges
and
some
were
broken
and
some
cracked
foot
was
set
upon
them
The
hobbits
struggled
until
last
they
were
clinging
with
desperate
fingers
the
steps
ahead
and
forcing
their
aching
knees
bend
and
straighten
and
ever
the
stair
cut
its
way
deeper
into
the
sheer
mountain
the
rocky
walls
rose
higher
and
higher
above
their
heads
length
just
they
felt
that
they
could
endure
more
they
saw
Gollum
eyes
peering
down
them
again
whispered
First
stair
past
Clever
hobbits
climb
high
very
clever
hobbits
Just
few
more
little
steps
and
that
all
yes
Dizzy
and
very
tired
Sam
and
Frodo
following
him
crawled
the
last
step
and
sat
down
rubbing
their
legs
and
knees
They
were
deep
dark
passage
that
seemed
still
before
them
though
gentler
slope
and
without
steps
Gollum
did
not
let
them
rest
long
There
another
stair
still
said
Much
longer
stair
Rest
when
get
the
top
next
stair
Not
yet
Sam
groaned
Longer
did
you
say
asked
Yes
yess
longer
said
Gollum
But
not
difficult
Hobbits
have
climbed
the
Straight
Stair
Next
comes
the
Winding
Stair
And
what
after
that
said
Sam
shall
see
said
Gollum
softly
yes
shall
see
thought
you
said
there
was
tunnel
said
Sam
Isn
there
tunnel
something
through
yes
there
tunnel
said
Gollum
But
hobbits
can
rest
before
they
try
that
they
get
through
that
they
nearly
the
top
Very
nearly
they
get
through
yes
Frodo
shivered
The
climb
had
made
him
sweat
but
now
felt
cold
and
clammy
and
there
was
chill
draught
the
dark
passage
blowing
down
from
the
invisible
heights
above
got
and
shook
himself
Well
let
said
This
place
sit
The
passage
seemed
for
miles
and
always
the
chill
air
flowed
over
them
rising
they
went
bitter
wind
The
mountains
seemed
trying
with
their
deadly
breath
daunt
them
turn
them
back
from
the
secrets
the
high
places
blow
them
away
into
the
darkness
behind
They
only
knew
that
they
had
come
the
end
when
suddenly
they
felt
wall
their
right
hand
They
could
see
very
little
Great
black
shapeless
masses
and
deep
grey
shadows
loomed
above
them
and
about
them
but
now
and
again
dull
red
light
flickered
under
the
lowering
clouds
and
for
moment
they
were
aware
tall
peaks
front
and
either
side
like
pillars
holding
vast
sagging
roof
They
seemed
have
climbed
many
hundreds
feet
wide
shelf
cliff
was
their
left
and
chasm
their
right
Gollum
led
the
way
close
under
the
cliff
For
the
present
they
were
longer
climbing
but
the
ground
was
now
more
broken
and
dangerous
the
dark
and
there
were
blocks
and
lumps
fallen
stone
the
way
Their
going
was
slow
and
cautious
How
many
hours
had
passed
since
they
had
entered
the
Morgul
Vale
neither
Sam
nor
Frodo
could
any
longer
guess
The
night
seemed
endless
length
they
were
once
more
aware
wall
looming
and
once
more
stairway
opened
before
them
Again
they
halted
and
again
they
began
climb
was
long
and
weary
ascent
but
this
stairway
did
not
delve
into
the
mountain
side
Here
the
huge
cliff
face
sloped
backwards
and
the
path
like
snake
wound
and
fro
across
one
point
crawled
sideways
right
the
edge
the
dark
chasm
and
Frodo
glancing
down
saw
below
him
vast
deep
pit
the
great
ravine
the
head
the
Morgul
Valley
Down
its
depths
glimmered
like
glow
worm
thread
the
wraith
road
from
the
dead
city
the
Nameless
Pass
turned
hastily
away
Still
and
the
stairway
bent
and
crawled
until
last
with
final
flight
short
and
straight
climbed
out
again
another
level
The
path
had
veered
away
from
the
main
pass
the
great
ravine
and
now
followed
its
own
perilous
course
the
bottom
lesser
cleft
among
the
higher
regions
the
Ephel
Dúath
Dimly
the
hobbits
could
discern
tall
piers
and
jagged
pinnacles
stone
either
side
between
which
were
great
crevices
and
fissures
blacker
than
the
night
where
forgotten
winters
had
gnawed
and
carved
the
sunless
stone
And
now
the
red
light
the
sky
seemed
stronger
though
they
could
not
tell
whether
dreadful
morning
were
indeed
coming
this
place
shadow
whether
they
saw
only
the
flame
some
great
violence
Sauron
the
torment
Gorgoroth
beyond
Still
far
ahead
and
still
high
above
Frodo
looking
saw
guessed
the
very
crown
this
bitter
road
Against
the
sullen
redness
the
eastern
sky
cleft
was
outlined
the
topmost
ridge
narrow
deep
cloven
between
two
black
shoulders
and
either
shoulder
was
horn
stone
paused
and
looked
more
attentively
The
horn
upon
the
left
was
tall
and
slender
and
burned
red
light
else
the
red
light
the
land
beyond
was
shining
through
hole
saw
now
was
black
tower
poised
above
the
outer
pass
touched
Sam
arm
and
pointed
don
like
the
look
that
said
Sam
this
secret
way
yours
guarded
after
all
growled
turning
Gollum
you
knew
all
along
suppose
All
ways
are
watched
yes
said
Gollum
course
they
are
But
hobbits
must
try
some
way
This
may
least
watched
Perhaps
they
all
gone
away
big
battle
perhaps
Perhaps
grunted
Sam
Well
still
seems
long
way
off
and
long
way
before
get
there
And
there
still
the
tunnel
think
you
ought
rest
now
Frodo
don
know
what
time
day
night
but
kept
going
for
hours
and
hours
Yes
must
rest
said
Frodo
Let
find
some
corner
out
the
wind
and
gather
our
strength
for
the
last
lap
For
felt
The
terrors
the
land
beyond
and
the
deed
done
there
seemed
remote
too
far
off
yet
trouble
him
All
his
mind
was
bent
getting
through
over
this
impenetrable
wall
and
guard
once
could
that
impossible
thing
then
somehow
the
errand
would
accomplished
seemed
him
that
dark
hour
weariness
still
labouring
the
stony
shadows
under
Cirith
Ungol
dark
crevice
between
two
great
piers
rock
they
sat
down
Frodo
and
Sam
little
way
within
and
Gollum
crouched
upon
the
ground
near
the
opening
There
the
hobbits
took
what
they
expected
would
their
last
meal
before
they
went
down
into
the
Nameless
Land
maybe
the
last
meal
they
would
ever
eat
together
Some
the
food
Gondor
they
ate
and
wafers
the
waybread
the
Elves
and
they
drank
little
But
their
water
they
were
sparing
and
took
only
enough
moisten
their
dry
mouths
wonder
when
find
water
again
said
Sam
But
suppose
even
over
there
they
drink
Orcs
drink
don
they
Yes
they
drink
said
Frodo
But
not
let
speak
that
Such
drink
not
for
Then
all
the
more
need
fill
our
bottles
said
Sam
But
there
isn
any
water
here
not
sound
trickle
have
heard
And
anyway
Faramir
said
were
not
drink
any
water
Morgul
water
flowing
out
Imlad
Morgul
were
his
words
said
Frodo
are
not
that
valley
now
and
came
spring
would
flowing
into
and
not
out
wouldn
trust
said
Sam
not
till
was
dying
thirst
There
wicked
feeling
about
this
place
sniffed
And
smell
fancy
you
notice
queer
kind
smell
stuffy
don
like
don
like
anything
here
all
said
Frodo
step
stone
breath
bone
Earth
air
and
water
all
seem
accursed
But
our
path
laid
Yes
that
said
Sam
And
shouldn
here
all
known
more
about
before
started
But
suppose
often
that
way
The
brave
things
the
old
tales
and
songs
Frodo
adventures
used
call
them
used
think
that
they
were
things
the
wonderful
folk
the
stories
went
out
and
looked
for
because
they
wanted
them
because
they
were
exciting
and
life
was
bit
dull
kind
sport
you
might
say
But
that
not
the
way
with
the
tales
that
really
mattered
the
ones
that
stay
the
mind
Folk
seem
have
been
just
landed
them
usually
their
paths
were
laid
that
way
you
put
But
expect
they
had
lots
chances
like
turning
back
only
they
didn
And
they
had
shouldn
know
because
they
have
been
forgotten
hear
about
those
just
went
and
not
all
good
end
mind
you
least
not
what
folk
inside
story
and
not
outside
call
good
end
You
know
coming
home
and
finding
things
all
right
though
not
quite
the
same
like
old
Bilbo
But
those
aren
always
the
best
tales
hear
though
they
may
the
best
tales
get
landed
wonder
what
sort
tale
fallen
into
wonder
said
Frodo
But
don
know
And
that
the
way
real
tale
Take
any
one
that
you
fond
You
may
know
guess
what
kind
tale
happy
ending
sad
ending
but
the
people
don
know
And
you
don
want
them
sir
course
not
Beren
now
never
thought
was
going
get
that
Silmaril
from
the
Iron
Crown
Thangorodrim
and
yet
did
and
that
was
worse
place
and
blacker
danger
than
ours
But
that
long
tale
course
and
goes
past
the
happiness
and
into
grief
and
beyond
and
the
Silmaril
went
and
came
Eärendil
And
why
sir
never
thought
that
before
got
you
got
some
the
light
that
star
glass
that
the
Lady
gave
you
Why
think
the
same
tale
still
going
Don
the
great
tales
never
end
they
never
end
tales
said
Frodo
But
the
people
them
come
and
when
their
part
ended
Our
part
will
end
later
sooner
And
then
can
have
some
rest
and
some
sleep
said
Sam
laughed
grimly
And
mean
just
that
Frodo
mean
plain
ordinary
rest
and
sleep
and
waking
morning
work
the
garden
afraid
that
all
hoping
for
all
the
time
All
the
big
important
plans
are
not
for
sort
Still
wonder
shall
ever
put
into
songs
tales
one
course
but
mean
put
into
words
you
know
told
the
fireside
read
out
great
big
book
with
red
and
black
letters
years
and
years
afterwards
And
people
will
say
Let
hear
about
Frodo
and
the
Ring
And
they
say
Yes
that
one
favourite
stories
Frodo
was
very
brave
wasn
dad
Yes
boy
the
famousest
the
hobbits
and
that
saying
lot
saying
lot
too
much
said
Frodo
and
laughed
long
clear
laugh
from
his
heart
Such
sound
had
not
been
heard
those
places
since
Sauron
came
Middle
earth
Sam
suddenly
seemed
all
the
stones
were
listening
and
the
tall
rocks
leaning
over
them
But
Frodo
did
not
heed
them
laughed
again
Why
Sam
said
hear
you
somehow
makes
merry
the
story
was
already
written
But
you
left
out
one
the
chief
characters
Samwise
the
stouthearted
want
hear
more
about
Sam
dad
Why
didn
they
put
more
his
talk
dad
That
what
like
makes
laugh
And
Frodo
wouldn
have
got
far
without
Sam
would
dad
Now
Frodo
said
Sam
you
shouldn
make
fun
was
serious
was
said
Frodo
and
going
bit
too
fast
You
and
Sam
are
still
stuck
the
worst
places
the
story
and
all
too
likely
that
some
will
say
this
point
Shut
the
book
now
dad
don
want
read
any
more
Maybe
said
Sam
but
wouldn
one
say
that
Things
done
and
over
and
made
into
part
the
great
tales
are
different
Why
even
Gollum
might
good
tale
better
than
have
you
anyway
And
used
like
tales
himself
once
his
own
account
wonder
thinks
the
hero
the
villain
Gollum
called
Would
you
like
the
hero
now
where
got
again
There
was
sign
him
the
mouth
their
shelter
nor
the
shadows
near
had
refused
their
food
though
had
usual
accepted
mouthful
water
and
then
had
seemed
curl
for
sleep
They
had
supposed
that
one
any
rate
his
objects
his
long
absence
the
day
before
had
been
hunt
for
food
his
own
liking
and
now
had
evidently
slipped
off
again
while
they
talked
But
what
for
this
time
don
like
his
sneaking
off
without
saying
said
Sam
And
least
all
now
can
looking
for
food
here
not
unless
there
some
kind
rock
fancies
Why
there
isn
even
bit
moss
good
worrying
about
him
now
said
Frodo
couldn
have
got
far
not
even
within
sight
the
pass
without
him
and
have
put
with
his
ways
false
false
All
the
same
rather
have
him
under
eye
said
Sam
All
the
more
false
you
remember
never
would
say
this
pass
was
guarded
And
now
see
tower
there
and
may
deserted
and
may
not
you
think
gone
fetch
them
Orcs
whatever
they
are
don
think
answered
Frodo
Even
some
wickedness
and
suppose
that
not
unlikely
don
think
that
not
fetch
Orcs
any
servants
the
Enemy
Why
wait
till
now
and
through
all
the
labour
the
climb
and
come
near
the
land
fears
could
probably
have
betrayed
Orcs
many
times
since
met
him
anything
will
some
little
private
trick
his
own
that
thinks
quite
secret
Well
suppose
you
right
Frodo
said
Sam
Not
that
comforts
mightily
don
make
mistake
don
doubt
hand
_me_
over
Orcs
gladly
kiss
his
hand
But
was
forgetting
his
Precious
suppose
the
whole
time
been
_The
Precious
for
poor
Sméagol_
That
the
one
idea
all
his
little
schemes
has
any
But
how
bringing
here
will
help
him
that
more
than
can
guess
Very
likely
can
guess
himself
said
Frodo
And
don
think
got
just
one
plain
scheme
his
muddled
head
think
really
part
trying
save
the
Precious
from
the
Enemy
long
can
For
that
would
the
last
disaster
for
himself
too
the
Enemy
got
And
the
other
part
perhaps
just
biding
his
time
and
waiting
chance
Yes
Slinker
and
Stinker
said
before
said
Sam
But
the
nearer
they
get
the
Enemy
land
the
more
like
Stinker
Slinker
will
get
Mark
words
ever
get
the
pass
won
let
really
take
the
precious
thing
over
the
border
without
making
some
kind
trouble
haven
got
there
yet
said
Frodo
but
better
keep
our
eyes
skinned
till
caught
napping
Stinker
will
come
out
top
pretty
quick
Not
but
what
would
safe
for
you
have
wink
now
master
Safe
you
lay
close
dearly
glad
see
you
have
sleep
keep
watch
over
you
and
anyway
you
lay
near
with
arm
round
you
one
could
come
pawing
you
without
your
Sam
knowing
Sleep
said
Frodo
and
sighed
out
desert
had
seen
mirage
cool
green
Yes
even
here
could
sleep
Sleep
then
master
Lay
your
head
lap
And
Gollum
found
them
hours
later
when
returned
crawling
and
creeping
down
the
path
out
the
gloom
ahead
Sam
sat
propped
against
the
stone
his
head
dropping
sideways
and
his
breathing
heavy
his
lap
lay
Frodo
head
drowned
deep
sleep
upon
his
white
forehead
lay
one
Sam
brown
hands
and
the
other
lay
softly
upon
his
master
breast
Peace
was
both
their
faces
Gollum
looked
them
strange
expression
passed
over
his
lean
hungry
face
The
gleam
faded
from
his
eyes
and
they
went
dim
and
grey
old
and
tired
spasm
pain
seemed
twist
him
and
turned
away
peering
back
towards
the
pass
shaking
his
head
engaged
some
interior
debate
Then
came
back
and
slowly
putting
out
trembling
hand
very
cautiously
touched
Frodo
knee
but
almost
the
touch
was
caress
For
fleeting
moment
could
one
the
sleepers
have
seen
him
they
would
have
thought
that
they
beheld
old
weary
hobbit
shrunken
the
years
that
had
carried
him
far
beyond
his
time
beyond
friends
and
kin
and
the
fields
and
streams
youth
old
starved
pitiable
thing
But
that
touch
Frodo
stirred
and
cried
out
softly
his
sleep
and
immediately
Sam
was
wide
awake
The
first
thing
saw
was
Gollum
pawing
master
thought
Hey
you
said
roughly
What
are
you
Nothing
nothing
said
Gollum
softly
Nice
Master
daresay
said
Sam
But
where
have
you
been
sneaking
off
and
sneaking
back
you
old
villain
Gollum
withdrew
himself
and
green
glint
flickered
under
his
heavy
lids
Almost
spider
like
looked
now
crouched
back
his
bent
limbs
with
his
protruding
eyes
The
fleeting
moment
had
passed
beyond
recall
Sneaking
sneaking
hissed
Hobbits
always
polite
yes
nice
hobbits
Sméagol
brings
them
secret
ways
that
nobody
else
could
find
Tired
thirsty
yes
thirsty
and
guides
them
and
searches
for
paths
and
they
say
_sneak
sneak_
Very
nice
friends
yes
precious
very
nice
Sam
felt
bit
remorseful
though
not
more
trustful
Sorry
said
sorry
but
you
startled
out
sleep
And
shouldn
have
been
sleeping
and
that
made
bit
sharp
But
Frodo
that
tired
asked
him
have
wink
and
well
that
how
Sorry
But
where
_have_
you
been
Sneaking
said
Gollum
and
the
green
glint
did
not
leave
his
eyes
very
well
said
Sam
have
your
own
way
don
suppose
far
from
the
truth
And
now
better
all
sneaking
along
together
What
the
time
today
tomorrow
tomorrow
said
Gollum
this
was
tomorrow
when
hobbits
went
sleep
Very
foolish
very
dangerous
poor
Sméagol
wasn
sneaking
about
watch
think
shall
get
tired
that
word
soon
said
Sam
But
never
mind
wake
master
Gently
smoothed
the
hair
back
from
Frodo
brow
and
bending
down
spoke
softly
him
Wake
Frodo
Wake
Frodo
stirred
and
opened
his
eyes
and
smiled
seeing
Sam
face
bending
over
him
Calling
early
aren
you
Sam
said
dark
still
Yes
always
dark
here
said
Sam
But
Gollum
come
back
Frodo
and
says
tomorrow
must
walking
The
last
lap
Frodo
drew
deep
breath
and
sat
The
last
lap
said
Hullo
Sméagol
Found
any
food
Have
you
had
any
rest
food
rest
nothing
for
Sméagol
said
Gollum
sneak
Sam
clicked
his
tongue
but
restrained
himself
Don
take
names
yourself
Sméagol
said
Frodo
unwise
whether
they
are
true
false
Sméagol
has
take
what
given
him
answered
Gollum
was
given
that
name
kind
Master
Samwise
the
hobbit
that
knows
much
Frodo
looked
Sam
Yes
sir
said
did
use
the
word
waking
out
sleep
sudden
and
all
and
finding
him
hand
said
was
sorry
but
soon
shan
Come
let
pass
then
said
Frodo
But
now
seem
have
come
the
point
you
and
Sméagol
Tell
Can
find
the
rest
the
way
ourselves
sight
the
pass
way
and
can
find
now
then
suppose
our
agreement
can
said
over
You
have
done
what
you
promised
and
you
free
free
back
food
and
rest
wherever
you
wish
except
servants
the
Enemy
And
one
day
may
reward
you
those
that
remember
not
yet
Gollum
whined
They
can
find
the
way
themselves
can
they
indeed
There
the
tunnel
coming
Sméagol
must
rest
food
Not
yet
_Chapter
Shelob
Lair
may
indeed
have
been
daytime
now
Gollum
said
but
the
hobbits
could
see
little
difference
unless
perhaps
the
heavy
sky
above
was
less
utterly
black
more
like
great
roof
smoke
while
instead
the
darkness
deep
night
which
lingered
still
cracks
and
holes
grey
blurring
shadow
shrouded
the
stony
world
about
them
They
passed
Gollum
front
and
the
hobbits
now
side
side
the
long
ravine
between
the
piers
and
columns
torn
and
weathered
rock
standing
like
huge
unshapen
statues
either
hand
There
was
sound
Some
way
ahead
mile
perhaps
was
great
grey
wall
last
huge
upthrusting
mass
mountain
stone
Darker
loomed
and
steadily
rose
they
approached
until
towered
high
above
them
shutting
out
the
view
all
that
lay
beyond
Deep
shadow
lay
before
its
feet
Sam
sniffed
the
air
Ugh
That
smell
said
getting
stronger
and
stronger
Presently
they
were
under
the
shadow
and
there
the
midst
they
saw
the
opening
cave
This
the
way
said
Gollum
softly
This
the
entrance
the
tunnel
did
not
speak
its
name
Torech
Ungol
Shelob
Lair
Out
came
stench
not
the
sickly
odour
decay
the
meads
Morgul
but
foul
reek
filth
unnameable
were
piled
and
hoarded
the
dark
within
this
the
only
way
Sméagol
said
Frodo
Yes
yes
answered
Yes
must
this
way
now
you
mean
say
you
been
through
this
hole
said
Sam
Phew
But
perhaps
you
don
mind
bad
smells
Gollum
eyes
glinted
doesn
know
what
minds
does
precious
doesn
But
Sméagol
can
bear
things
Yes
been
through
yes
right
through
the
only
way
And
what
makes
the
smell
wonder
said
Sam
like
well
wouldn
like
say
Some
beastly
hole
the
Orcs
warrant
with
hundred
years
their
filth
Well
said
Frodo
Orcs
the
only
way
must
take
Drawing
deep
breath
they
passed
inside
few
steps
they
were
utter
and
impenetrable
dark
Not
since
the
lightless
passages
Moria
had
Frodo
Sam
known
such
darkness
and
possible
here
was
deeper
and
denser
There
there
were
airs
moving
and
echoes
and
sense
space
Here
the
air
was
still
stagnant
heavy
and
sound
fell
dead
They
walked
were
black
vapour
wrought
veritable
darkness
itself
that
was
breathed
brought
blindness
not
only
the
eyes
but
the
mind
that
even
the
memory
colours
and
forms
and
any
light
faded
out
thought
Night
always
had
been
and
always
would
and
night
was
all
But
for
while
they
could
still
feel
and
indeed
the
senses
their
feet
and
fingers
first
seemed
sharpened
almost
painfully
The
walls
felt
their
surprise
smooth
and
the
floor
save
for
step
now
and
again
was
straight
and
even
going
ever
the
same
stiff
slope
The
tunnel
was
high
and
wide
wide
that
though
the
hobbits
walked
abreast
only
touching
the
side
walls
with
their
outstretched
hands
they
were
separated
cut
off
alone
the
darkness
Gollum
had
gone
first
and
seemed
only
few
steps
ahead
While
they
were
still
able
give
heed
such
things
they
could
hear
his
breath
hissing
and
gasping
just
front
them
But
after
time
their
senses
became
duller
both
touch
and
hearing
seemed
grow
numb
and
they
kept
groping
walking
and
mainly
the
force
the
will
with
which
they
had
entered
will
through
and
desire
come
last
the
high
gate
beyond
Before
they
had
gone
very
far
perhaps
but
time
and
distance
soon
passed
out
his
reckoning
Sam
the
right
feeling
the
wall
was
aware
that
there
was
opening
the
side
for
moment
caught
faint
breath
some
air
less
heavy
and
then
they
passed
There
more
than
one
passage
here
whispered
with
effort
seemed
hard
make
his
breath
give
any
sound
orc
like
place
ever
there
could
After
that
first
the
right
and
then
Frodo
the
left
passed
three
four
such
openings
some
wider
some
smaller
but
there
was
yet
doubt
the
main
way
for
was
straight
and
did
not
turn
and
still
went
steadily
But
how
long
was
how
much
more
this
would
they
have
endure
could
they
endure
The
breathlessness
the
air
was
growing
they
climbed
and
now
they
seemed
often
the
blind
dark
sense
some
resistance
thicker
than
the
foul
air
they
thrust
forward
they
felt
things
brush
against
their
heads
against
their
hands
long
tentacles
hanging
growths
perhaps
they
could
not
tell
what
they
were
And
still
the
stench
grew
grew
until
almost
seemed
them
that
smell
was
the
only
clear
sense
left
them
and
that
was
for
their
torment
One
hour
two
hours
three
hours
how
many
had
they
passed
this
lightless
hole
Hours
days
weeks
rather
Sam
left
the
tunnel
side
and
shrank
towards
Frodo
and
their
hands
met
and
clasped
and
together
they
still
went
length
Frodo
groping
along
the
left
hand
wall
came
suddenly
void
Almost
fell
sideways
into
the
emptiness
Here
was
some
opening
the
rock
far
wider
than
any
they
had
yet
passed
and
out
came
reek
foul
and
sense
lurking
malice
intense
that
Frodo
reeled
And
that
moment
Sam
too
lurched
and
fell
forwards
Fighting
off
both
the
sickness
and
the
fear
Frodo
gripped
Sam
hand
said
hoarse
breath
without
voice
all
comes
from
here
the
stench
and
the
peril
Now
for
Quick
Calling
his
remaining
strength
and
resolution
dragged
Sam
his
feet
and
forced
his
own
limbs
move
Sam
stumbled
beside
him
One
step
two
steps
three
steps
last
six
steps
Maybe
they
had
passed
the
dreadful
unseen
opening
but
whether
that
was
not
suddenly
was
easier
move
some
hostile
will
for
the
moment
had
released
them
They
struggled
still
hand
hand
But
almost
once
they
came
new
difficulty
The
tunnel
forked
seemed
and
the
dark
they
could
not
tell
which
was
the
wider
way
which
kept
nearer
the
straight
Which
should
they
take
the
left
the
right
They
knew
nothing
guide
them
yet
false
choice
would
almost
certainly
fatal
Which
way
has
Gollum
gone
panted
Sam
And
why
didn
wait
Sméagol
said
Frodo
trying
call
Sméagol
But
his
voice
croaked
and
the
name
fell
dead
almost
left
his
lips
There
was
answer
not
echo
not
even
tremor
the
air
really
gone
this
time
fancy
muttered
Sam
guess
this
just
exactly
where
meant
bring
Gollum
ever
lay
hands
you
again
you
sorry
for
Presently
groping
and
fumbling
the
dark
they
found
that
the
opening
the
left
was
blocked
either
was
blind
else
some
great
stone
had
fallen
the
passage
This
can
the
way
Frodo
whispered
Right
wrong
must
take
the
other
And
quick
Sam
panted
There
something
worse
than
Gollum
about
can
feel
something
looking
They
had
not
gone
more
than
few
yards
when
from
behind
them
came
sound
startling
and
horrible
the
heavy
padded
silence
gurgling
bubbling
noise
and
long
venomous
hiss
They
wheeled
round
but
nothing
could
seen
Still
stones
they
stood
staring
waiting
for
they
did
not
know
what
trap
said
Sam
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
hilt
his
sword
and
did
thought
the
darkness
the
barrow
whence
came
wish
old
Tom
was
near
now
thought
Then
stood
darkness
about
him
and
blackness
despair
and
anger
his
heart
seemed
him
that
saw
light
light
his
mind
almost
unbearably
bright
first
sun
ray
the
eyes
one
long
hidden
windowless
pit
Then
the
light
became
colour
green
gold
silver
white
Far
off
little
picture
drawn
elven
fingers
saw
the
Lady
Galadriel
standing
the
grass
Lórien
and
gifts
were
her
hands
_And
you
Ring
bearer_
heard
her
say
remote
but
clear_
for
you
have
prepared
this_
The
bubbling
hiss
drew
nearer
and
there
was
creaking
some
great
jointed
thing
that
moved
with
slow
purpose
the
dark
reek
came
before
Master
master
cried
Sam
and
the
life
and
urgency
came
back
into
his
voice
The
Lady
gift
The
star
glass
light
you
dark
places
she
said
was
The
star
glass
The
star
glass
muttered
Frodo
one
answering
out
sleep
hardly
comprehending
Why
yes
Why
had
forgotten
light
when
all
other
lights
out
And
now
indeed
light
alone
can
help
Slowly
his
hand
went
his
bosom
and
slowly
held
aloft
the
Phial
Galadriel
For
moment
glimmered
faint
rising
star
struggling
heavy
earthward
mists
and
then
its
power
waxed
and
hope
grew
Frodo
mind
began
burn
and
kindled
silver
flame
minute
heart
dazzling
light
though
Eärendil
had
himself
come
down
from
the
high
sunset
paths
with
the
last
Silmaril
upon
his
brow
The
darkness
receded
from
until
seemed
shine
the
centre
globe
airy
crystal
and
the
hand
that
held
sparkled
with
white
fire
Frodo
gazed
wonder
this
marvellous
gift
that
had
long
carried
not
guessing
its
full
worth
and
potency
Seldom
had
remembered
the
road
until
they
came
Morgul
Vale
and
never
had
used
for
fear
its
revealing
light
_Aiya
Eärendil
Elenion
Ancalima
cried
and
knew
not
what
had
spoken
for
seemed
that
another
voice
spoke
through
his
clear
untroubled
the
foul
air
the
pit
But
other
potencies
there
are
Middle
earth
powers
night
and
they
are
old
and
strong
And
She
that
walked
the
darkness
had
heard
the
Elves
cry
that
cry
far
back
the
deeps
time
and
she
had
not
heeded
and
did
not
daunt
her
now
Even
Frodo
spoke
felt
great
malice
bent
upon
him
and
deadly
regard
considering
him
Not
far
down
the
tunnel
between
them
and
the
opening
where
they
had
reeled
and
stumbled
was
aware
eyes
growing
visible
two
great
clusters
many
windowed
eyes
the
coming
menace
was
unmasked
last
The
radiance
the
star
glass
was
broken
and
thrown
back
from
their
thousand
facets
but
behind
the
glitter
pale
deadly
fire
began
steadily
glow
within
flame
kindled
some
deep
pit
evil
thought
Monstrous
and
abominable
eyes
they
were
bestial
and
yet
filled
with
purpose
and
with
hideous
delight
gloating
over
their
prey
trapped
beyond
all
hope
escape
Frodo
and
Sam
horror
stricken
began
slowly
back
away
their
own
gaze
held
the
dreadful
stare
those
baleful
eyes
but
they
backed
the
eyes
advanced
Frodo
hand
wavered
and
slowly
the
Phial
drooped
Then
suddenly
released
from
the
holding
spell
run
little
while
vain
panic
for
the
amusement
the
eyes
they
both
turned
and
fled
together
but
even
they
ran
Frodo
looked
back
and
saw
with
terror
that
once
the
eyes
came
leaping
behind
The
stench
death
was
like
cloud
about
him
Stand
stand
cried
desperately
Running
use
Slowly
the
eyes
crept
nearer
Galadriel
called
and
gathering
his
courage
lifted
the
Phial
once
more
The
eyes
halted
For
moment
their
regard
relaxed
some
hint
doubt
troubled
them
Then
Frodo
heart
flamed
within
him
and
without
thinking
what
did
whether
was
folly
despair
courage
took
the
Phial
his
left
hand
and
with
his
right
hand
drew
his
sword
Sting
flashed
out
and
the
sharp
elven
blade
sparkled
the
silver
light
but
its
edges
blue
fire
flicked
Then
holding
the
star
aloft
and
the
bright
sword
advanced
Frodo
hobbit
the
Shire
walked
steadily
down
meet
the
eyes
They
wavered
Doubt
came
into
them
the
light
approached
One
one
they
dimmed
and
slowly
they
drew
back
brightness
deadly
had
ever
afflicted
them
before
From
sun
and
moon
and
star
they
had
been
safe
underground
but
now
star
had
descended
into
the
very
earth
Still
approached
and
the
eyes
began
quail
One
one
they
all
went
dark
they
turned
away
and
great
bulk
beyond
the
light
reach
heaved
its
huge
shadow
between
They
were
gone
Master
master
cried
Sam
was
close
behind
his
own
sword
drawn
and
ready
Stars
and
glory
But
the
Elves
would
make
song
that
ever
they
heard
And
may
live
tell
them
and
hear
them
sing
But
don
master
Don
down
that
den
Now
our
only
chance
Now
let
get
out
this
foul
hole
And
back
they
turned
once
more
first
walking
and
then
running
for
they
went
the
floor
the
tunnel
rose
steeply
and
with
every
stride
they
climbed
higher
above
the
stenches
the
unseen
lair
and
strength
returned
limb
and
heart
But
still
the
hatred
the
Watcher
lurked
behind
them
blind
for
while
perhaps
but
undefeated
still
bent
death
And
now
there
came
flow
air
meet
them
cold
and
thin
The
opening
the
tunnel
end
last
was
before
them
Panting
yearning
for
roofless
place
they
flung
themselves
forward
and
then
amazement
they
staggered
tumbling
back
The
outlet
was
blocked
with
some
barrier
but
not
stone
soft
and
little
yielding
seemed
and
yet
strong
and
impervious
air
filtered
through
hut
not
glimmer
any
light
Once
more
they
charged
and
were
hurled
back
Holding
aloft
the
Phial
Frodo
looked
and
before
him
saw
greyness
which
the
radiance
the
star
glass
did
not
pierce
and
did
not
illuminate
were
shadow
that
being
cast
light
light
could
dissipate
Across
the
width
and
height
the
tunnel
vast
web
was
spun
orderly
the
web
some
huge
spider
but
denser
woven
and
far
greater
and
each
thread
was
thick
rope
Sam
laughed
grimly
Cobwebs
said
that
all
Cobwebs
But
what
spider
Have
down
with
fury
hewed
them
with
his
sword
but
the
thread
that
struck
did
not
break
gave
little
and
then
sprang
back
like
plucked
bowstring
turning
the
blade
and
tossing
both
sword
and
arm
Three
times
Sam
struck
with
all
his
force
and
last
one
single
cord
all
the
countless
cords
snapped
and
twisted
curling
and
whipping
through
the
air
One
end
lashed
Sam
hand
and
cried
out
pain
starting
back
and
drawing
his
hand
across
his
mouth
will
take
days
clear
the
road
like
this
said
What
done
Have
those
eyes
come
back
not
seen
said
Frodo
But
still
feel
that
they
are
looking
thinking
about
making
some
other
plan
perhaps
this
light
were
lowered
failed
they
would
quickly
come
again
Trapped
the
end
said
Sam
bitterly
his
anger
rising
again
above
weariness
and
despair
Gnats
net
May
the
curse
Faramir
bite
that
Gollum
and
bite
him
quick
That
would
not
help
now
said
Frodo
Come
Let
see
what
Sting
can
elven
blade
There
were
webs
horror
the
dark
ravines
Beleriand
where
was
forged
But
you
must
the
guard
and
hold
back
the
eyes
Here
take
the
star
glass
not
afraid
Hold
and
watch
Then
Frodo
stepped
the
great
grey
net
and
hewed
with
wide
sweeping
stroke
drawing
the
bitter
edge
swiftly
across
ladder
close
strung
cords
and
once
springing
away
The
blue
gleaming
blade
shore
through
them
like
scythe
through
grass
and
they
leaped
and
writhed
and
then
hung
loose
great
rent
was
made
Stroke
after
stroke
dealt
until
last
all
the
web
within
his
reach
was
shattered
and
the
upper
portion
blew
and
swayed
like
loose
veil
the
incoming
wind
The
trap
was
broken
Come
cried
Frodo
Wild
joy
their
escape
from
the
very
mouth
despair
suddenly
filled
all
his
mind
His
head
whirled
with
draught
potent
wine
sprang
out
shouting
came
seemed
light
that
dark
land
his
eyes
that
had
passed
through
the
den
night
The
great
smokes
had
risen
and
grown
thinner
and
the
last
hours
sombre
day
were
passing
the
red
glare
Mordor
had
died
away
sullen
gloom
Yet
seemed
Frodo
that
looked
upon
morning
sudden
hope
Almost
had
reached
the
summit
the
wall
Only
little
higher
now
The
Cleft
Cirith
Ungol
was
before
him
dim
notch
the
black
ridge
and
the
horns
rock
darkling
the
sky
either
side
short
race
sprinter
course
and
would
through
The
pass
Sam
cried
not
heeding
the
shrillness
his
voice
that
released
from
the
choking
airs
the
tunnel
rang
out
now
high
and
wild
The
pass
Run
run
and
through
through
before
any
one
can
stop
Sam
came
behind
fast
could
urge
his
legs
but
glad
was
free
was
uneasy
and
ran
kept
glancing
back
the
dark
arch
the
tunnel
fearing
see
eyes
some
shape
beyond
his
imagining
spring
out
pursuit
Too
little
did
his
master
know
the
craft
Shelob
She
had
many
exits
from
her
lair
There
agelong
she
had
dwelt
evil
thing
spider
form
even
such
once
old
had
lived
the
Land
the
Elves
the
West
that
now
under
the
Sea
such
Beren
fought
the
Mountains
Terror
Doriath
and
came
Lúthien
upon
the
green
sward
amid
the
hemlocks
the
moonlight
long
ago
How
Shelob
came
there
flying
from
ruin
tale
tells
for
out
the
Dark
Years
few
tales
have
come
But
still
she
was
there
who
was
there
before
Sauron
and
before
the
first
stone
Barad
dûr
and
she
served
none
but
herself
drinking
the
blood
Elves
and
Men
bloated
and
grown
fat
with
endless
brooding
her
feasts
weaving
webs
shadow
for
all
living
things
were
her
food
and
her
vomit
darkness
Far
and
wide
her
lesser
broods
bastards
the
miserable
mates
her
own
offspring
that
she
slew
spread
from
glen
glen
from
the
Ephel
Dúath
the
eastern
hills
Dol
Guldur
and
the
fastnesses
Mirkwood
But
none
could
rival
her
Shelob
the
Great
last
child
Ungoliant
trouble
the
unhappy
world
Already
years
before
Gollum
had
beheld
her
Sméagol
who
pried
into
all
dark
holes
and
past
days
had
bowed
and
worshipped
her
and
the
darkness
her
evil
will
walked
through
all
the
ways
his
weariness
beside
him
cutting
him
off
from
light
and
from
regret
And
had
promised
bring
her
food
But
her
lust
was
not
his
lust
Little
she
knew
cared

swollen
till
the

could

her
and

her
But
that
desire
was
yet
far
away
and
long
now
had
she
been
hungry
lurking
her
den
while
the
power
Sauron
grew
and
light
and
living
things
forsook
his
borders
and
the
city
the
valley
was
dead
and
Elf
Man
came
near
only
the
unhappy
Orcs
Poor
food
and
wary
But
she
must
eat
and
however
busily
they
delved
new
winding
passages
from
the
pass
and
from
their
tower
ever
she
found
some

them
But
she
lusted
for

And
Gollum

Then

his
cunning
which
still
hoped
hide
from
her
even
when
had
come
her
again
and
had
bowed
low
before
her
while
his
companions
slept
And
for
Sauron
knew

she
lurked

him
that
she
should
dwell
there

unabated
malice
more
sure
watch
upon
that
ancient
path
into
his
land
than
any

that
his

could
have

And
Orcs
they
were
useful
slaves
but
had
them
plenty
now
and
again
Shelob
caught
them
stay
her
appetite
she
was
welcome
could
spare
them
And
sometimes
man
may
cast
dainty
his
cat
_his
cat_
calls
her
but
she
owns
him
not
Sauron
would
send
her
prisoners
that
had
better
uses
for
would
have
them
driven
her
hole
and
report
brought
back
him
the
play
she
made
they
both
lived
delighting
their
own
devices
and
feared
assault
nor
wrath
nor
any
end
their
wickedness
Never
yet
had
any
fly
escaped
from
Shelob
webs
and
the
greater
now
was
her
rage
and
hunger
But
nothing
this
evil
which
they
had
stirred
against
them
did
poor
Sam
know
except
that
fear
was
growing
him
menace
which
could
not
see
and
such
weight
did
become
that
was
burden
him
run
and
his
feet
seemed
leaden
Dread
was
round
him
and
enemies
before
him
the
pass
and
his
master
was
fey
mood
running
heedlessly
meet
them
Turning
his
eyes
away
from
the
shadow
behind
and
the
deep
gloom
beneath
the
cliff
upon
his
left
looked
ahead
and
saw
two
things
that
increased
his
dismay
saw
that
the
sword
which
Frodo
still
held
unsheathed
was
glittering
with
blue
flame
and
saw
that
though
the
sky
behind
was
now
dark
still
the
window
the
tower
was
glowing
red
Orcs
muttered
never
rush
like
this
There
Orcs
about
and
worse
than
Orcs
Then
returning
quickly
his
long
habit
secrecy
closed
his
hand
about
the
precious
Phial
which
still
bore
Red
with
his
own
living
blood
his
hand
shone
for
moment
and
then
thrust
the
revealing
light
deep
into
pocket
near
his
breast
and
drew
his
elven
cloak
about
him
Now
tried
quicken
his
pace
His
master
was
gaining
him
already
was
some
twenty
strides
ahead
flitting
like
shadow
soon
would
lost
sight
that
grey
world
Hardly
had
Sam
hidden
the
light
the
star
glass
when
she
came
little
way
ahead
and
his
left
saw
suddenly
issuing
from
black
hole
shadow
under
the
cliff
the
most
loathly
shape
that
had
ever
beheld
horrible
beyond
the
horror
evil
dream
Most
like
spider
she
was
but
huger
than
the
great
hunting
beasts
and
more
terrible
than
they
because
the
evil
purpose
her
remorseless
eyes
Those
same
eyes
that
had
thought
daunted
and
defeated
there
they
were
lit
with
fell
light
again
clustering
her
out
thrust
head
Great
horns
she
had
and
behind
her
short
stalk
like
neck
was
her
huge
swollen
body
vast
bloated
bag
swaying
and
sagging
between
her
legs
its
great
bulk
was
black
blotched
with
livid
marks
but
the
belly
underneath
was
pale
and
luminous
and
gave
forth
stench
Her
legs
were
bent
with
great
knobbed
joints
high
above
her
back
and
hairs
that
stuck
out
like
steel
spines
and
each
leg
end
there
was
claw
soon
she
had
squeezed
her
soft
squelching
body
and
its
folded
limbs
out
the
upper
exit
from
her
lair
she
moved
with
horrible
speed
now
running
her
creaking
legs
now
making
sudden
bound
She
was
between
Sam
and
his
master
Either
she
did
not
see
Sam
she
avoided
him
for
the
moment
the
bearer
the
light
and
fixed
all
her
intent
upon
one
prey
upon
Frodo
bereft
his
Phial
running
heedless
the
path
unaware
yet
his
peril
Swiftly
ran
but
Shelob
was
swifter
few
leaps
she
would
have
him
Sam
gasped
and
gathered
all
his
remaining
breath
shout
Look
out
behind
yelled
Look
out
master
but
suddenly
his
cry
was
stifled
long
clammy
hand
went
over
his
mouth
and
another
caught
him
the
neck
while
something
wrapped
itself
about
his
leg
Taken
off
his
guard
toppled
backwards
into
the
arms
his
attacker
Got
him
hissed
Gollum
his
ear
last
precious
got
him
yes
the
nassty
hobbit
takes
this
one
She
get
the
other
yes
Shelob
will
get
him
not
Sméagol
promised
won
hurt
Master
all
But
got
you
you
nassty
filthy
little
sneak
spat
Sam
neck
Fury
the
treachery
and
desperation
the
delay
when
his
master
was
deadly
peril
gave
Sam
sudden
violence
and
strength
that
was
far
beyond
anything
that
Gollum
had
expected
from
this
slow
stupid
hobbit
thought
him
Not
Gollum
himself
could
have
twisted
more
quickly
more
fiercely
His
hold
Sam
mouth
slipped
and
Sam
ducked
and
lunged
forward
again
trying
tear
away
from
the
grip
his
neck
His
sword
was
still
his
hand
and
his
left
arm
hanging
its
thong
was
Faramir
staff
Desperately
tried
turn
and
stab
his
enemy
But
Gollum
was
too
quick
His
long
right
arm
shot
out
and
grabbed
Sam
wrist
his
fingers
were
like
vice
slowly
and
relentlessly
bent
the
hand
down
and
forward
till
with
cry
pain
Sam
released
the
sword
and
fell
the
ground
and
all
the
while
Gollum
other
hand
was
tightening
Sam
throat
Then
Sam
played
his
last
trick
With
all
his
strength
pulled
away
and
got
his
feet
firmly
planted
then
suddenly
drove
his
legs
against
the
ground
and
with
his
whole
force
hurled
himself
backwards
Not
expecting
even
this
simple
trick
from
Sam
Gollum
fell
over
with
Sam
top
and
received
the
weight
the
sturdy
hobbit
his
stomach
sharp
hiss
came
out
him
and
for
second
his
hand
upon
Sam
throat
loosened
but
his
fingers
still
gripped
the
sword
hand
Sam
tore
himself
forward
and
away
and
stood
and
then
quickly
wheeled
away
his
right
pivoted
the
wrist
held
Gollum
Laying
hold
the
staff
with
his
left
hand
Sam
swung
and
down
came
with
whistling
crack
Gollum
outstretched
arm
just
below
the
elbow
With
squeal
Gollum
let
Then
Sam
waded
not
waiting
change
the
staff
from
left
right
dealt
another
savage
blow
Quick
snake
Gollum
slithered
aside
and
the
stroke
aimed
his
head
fell
across
his
back
The
staff
cracked
and
broke
That
was
enough
for
him
Grabbing
from
behind
was
old
game
his
and
seldom
had
failed
But
this
time
misled
spite
had
made
the
mistake
speaking
and
gloating
before
had
both
hands
his
victim
neck
Everything
had
gone
wrong
with
his
beautiful
plan
since
that
horrible
light
had
unexpectedly
appeared
the
darkness
And
now
was
face
face
with
furious
enemy
little
less
than
his
own
size
This
fight
was
not
for
him
Sam
swept
his
sword
from
the
ground
and
raised
Gollum
squealed
and
springing
aside
all
fours
jumped
away
one
big
bound
like
frog
Before
Sam
could
reach
him
was
off
running
with
amazing
speed
back
towards
the
tunnel
Sword
hand
Sam
went
after
him
For
the
moment
had
forgotten
everything
else
but
the
red
fury
his
brain
and
the
desire
kill
Gollum
But
before
could
overtake
him
Gollum
was
gone
Then
the
dark
hole
stood
before
him
and
the
stench
came
out
meet
him
like
clap
thunder
the
thought
Frodo
and
the
monster
smote
upon
Sam
mind
spun
round
and
rushed
wildly
the
path
calling
and
calling
his
master
name
was
too
late
far
Gollum
plot
had
succeeded
_Chapter
10_
The
Choices
Master
Samwise
Frodo
was
lying
face
upward
the
ground
and
the
monster
was
bending
over
him
intent
upon
her
victim
that
she
took
heed
Sam
and
his
cries
until
was
close
hand
rushed
saw
that
Frodo
was
already
bound
cords
wound
about
him
from
ankle
shoulder
and
the
monster
with
her
great
forelegs
was
beginning
half
lift
half
drag
his
body
away
the
near
side
him
lay
gleaming
the
ground
his
elven
blade
where
had
fallen
useless
from
his
grasp
Sam
did
not
wait
wonder
what
was
done
whether
was
brave
loyal
filled
with
rage
sprang
forward
with
yell
and
seized
his
master
sword
his
left
hand
Then
charged
onslaught
more
fierce
was
ever
seen
the
savage
world
beasts
where
some
desperate
small
creature
armed
with
little
teeth
alone
will
spring
upon
tower
horn
and
hide
that
stands
above
its
fallen
mate
Disturbed
out
some
gloating
dream
his
small
yell
she
turned
slowly
the
dreadful
malice
her
glance
upon
him
But
almost
before
she
was
aware
that
fury
was
upon
her
greater
than
any
she
had
known
countless
years
the
shining
sword
bit
upon
her
foot
and
shore
away
the
claw
Sam
sprang
inside
the
arches
her
legs
and
with
quick
upthrust
his
other
hand
stabbed
the
clustered
eyes
upon
her
lowered
head
One
great
eye
went
dark
Now
the
miserable
creature
was
right
under
her
for
the
moment
out
the
reach
her
sting
and
her
claws
Her
vast
belly
was
above
him
with
its
putrid
light
and
the
stench
almost
smote
him
down
Still
his
fury
held
for
one
more
blow
and
before
she
could
sink
upon
him
smothering
him
and
all
his
little
impudence
courage
slashed
the
bright
elven
blade
across
her
with
desperate
strength
But
Shelob
was
not
dragons
are
softer
spot
had
she
save
only
her
eyes
Knobbed
and
pitted
with
corruption
was
her
age
old
hide
but
ever
thickened
from
within
with
layer
layer
evil
growth
The
blade
scored
with
dreadful
gash
but
those
hideous
folds
could
not
pierced
any
strength
men
not
though
Elf
Dwarf
should
forge
the
steel
the
hand
Beren
Túrin
wield
She
yielded
the
stroke
and
then
heaved
the
great
bag
her
belly
high
above
Sam
head
Poison
frothed
and
bubbled
from
the
wound
Now
splaying
her
legs
she
drove
her
huge
bulk
down
him
again
Too
soon
For
Sam
still
stood
upon
his
feet
and
dropping
his
own
sword
with
both
hands
held
the
elven
blade
point
upwards
fending
off
that
ghastly
roof
and
Shelob
with
the
driving
force
her
own
cruel
will
with
strength
greater
than
any
warrior
hand
thrust
herself
upon
bitter
spike
Deep
deep
pricked
Sam
was
crushed
slowly
the
ground
such
anguish
had
Shelob
ever
known
dreamed
knowing
all
her
long
world
wickedness
Not
the
doughtiest
soldier
old
Gondor
nor
the
most
savage
Orc
entrapped
had
ever
thus
endured
her
set
blade
her
beloved
flesh
shudder
went
through
her
Heaving
again
wrenching
away
from
the
pain
she
bent
her
writhing
limbs
beneath
her
and
sprang
backwards
convulsive
leap
Sam
had
fallen
his
knees
Frodo
head
his
senses
reeling
the
foul
stench
his
two
hands
still
gripping
the
hilt
the
sword
Through
the
mist
before
his
eyes
was
aware
dimly
Frodo
face
and
stubbornly
fought
master
himself
and
drag
himself
out
the
swoon
that
was
upon
him
Slowly
raised
his
head
and
saw
her
only
few
paces
away
eyeing
him
her
beak
drabbling
spittle
venom
and
green
ooze
trickling
from
below
her
wounded
eye
There
she
crouched
her
shuddering
belly
splayed
upon
the
ground
the
great
bows
her
legs
quivering
she
gathered
herself
for
another
spring
this
time
crush
and
sting
death
little
bite
poison
still
the
struggling
her
meat
this
time
slay
and
then
rend
Even
Sam
himself
crouched
looking
her
seeing
his
death
her
eyes
thought
came
him
some
remote
voice
had
spoken
and
fumbled
his
breast
with
his
left
hand
and
found
what
sought
cold
and
hard
and
solid
seemed
his
touch
phantom
world
horror
the
Phial
Galadriel
Galadriel
said
faintly
and
then
heard
voices
far
off
but
clear
the
crying
the
Elves
they
walked
under
the
stars
the
beloved
shadows
the
Shire
and
the
music
the
Elves
came
through
his
sleep
the
Hall
Fire
the
house
Elrond
Gilthoniel
Elbereth
And
then
his
tongue
was
loosed
and
his
voice
cried
language
which
did
not
know
Elbereth
Gilthoniel
menel
palan
diriel
nallon
nguruthos
tiro
nin
Fanuilos
And
with
that
staggered
his
feet
and
was
Samwise
the
hobbit
Hamfast
son
again
Now
come
you
filth
cried
You
hurt
master
you
brute
and
you
pay
for
going
but
settle
with
you
first
Come
and
taste
again
his
indomitable
spirit
had
set
its
potency
motion
the
glass
blazed
suddenly
like
white
torch
his
hand
flamed
like
star
that
leaping
from
the
firmament
sears
the
dark
air
with
intolerable
light
such
terror
out
heaven
had
ever
burned
Shelob
face
before
The
beams
entered
into
her
wounded
head
and
scored
with
unbearable
pain
and
the
dreadful
infection
light
spread
from
eye
eye
She
fell
back
beating
the
air
with
her
forelegs
her
sight
blasted
inner
lightnings
her
mind
agony
Then
turning
her
maimed
head
away
she
rolled
aside
and
began
crawl
claw
claw
towards
the
opening
the
dark
cliff
behind
Sam
came
was
reeling
like
drunken
man
but
came
And
Shelob
cowed
last
shrunken
defeat
jerked
and
quivered
she
tried
hasten
from
him
She
reached
the
hole
and
squeezing
down
leaving
trail
green
yellow
slime
she
slipped
even
Sam
hewed
last
stroke
her
dragging
legs
Then
fell
the
ground
Shelob
was
gone
and
whether
she
lay
long
her
lair
nursing
her
malice
and
her
misery
and
slow
years
darkness
healed
herself
from
within
rebuilding
her
clustered
eyes
until
with
hunger
like
death
she
spun
once
more
her
dreadful
snares
the
glens
the
Mountains
Shadow
this
tale
does
not
tell
Sam
was
left
alone
Wearily
the
evening
the
Nameless
Land
fell
upon
the
place
battle
crawled
back
his
master
Master
dear
master
said
but
Frodo
did
not
speak
had
run
forward
eager
rejoicing
free
Shelob
with
hideous
speed
had
come
behind
and
with
one
swift
stroke
had
stung
him
the
neck
lay
now
pale
and
heard
voice
and
did
not
move
Master
dear
master
said
Sam
and
through
long
silence
waited
listening
vain
Then
quickly
could
cut
away
the
binding
cords
and
laid
his
head
upon
Frodo
breast
and
his
mouth
but
stir
life
could
find
nor
feel
the
faintest
flutter
the
heart
Often
chafed
his
master
hands
and
feet
and
touched
his
brow
but
all
were
cold
Frodo
Frodo
called
Don
leave
here
alone
your
Sam
calling
Don
where
can
follow
Wake
Frodo
wake
Frodo
dear
dear
Wake
Then
anger
surged
over
hint
and
ran
about
his
master
body
rage
stabbing
the
air
and
smiting
the
stones
and
shouting
challenges
Presently
came
back
and
bending
looked
Frodo
face
pale
beneath
him
the
dusk
And
suddenly
saw
that
was
the
picture
that
was
revealed
him
the
mirror
Galadriel
Lórien
Frodo
with
pale
face
lying
fast
asleep
under
great
dark
cliff
fast
asleep
had
thought
then
dead
said
Not
asleep
dead
And
said
the
words
had
set
the
venom
its
work
again
seemed
him
that
the
hue
the
face
grew
livid
green
And
then
black
despair
came
down
him
and
Sam
bowed
the
ground
and
drew
his
grey
hood
over
his
head
and
night
came
into
his
heart
and
knew
more
When
last
the
blackness
passed
Sam
looked
and
shadows
were
about
him
but
for
how
many
minutes
hours
the
world
had
gone
dragging
could
not
tell
was
still
the
same
place
and
still
his
master
lay
beside
him
dead
The
mountains
had
not
crumbled
nor
the
earth
fallen
into
ruin
What
shall
what
shall
said
Did
come
all
this
way
with
him
for
nothing
And
then
remembered
his
own
voice
speaking
words
that
the
time
did
not
understand
himself
the
beginning
their
journey
have
something
before
the
end
must
see
through
sir
you
understand_
But
what
can
Not
leave
Frodo
dead
unburied
the
top
the
mountains
and
home
repeated
and
for
moment
doubt
and
fear
shook
him
that
what
got
And
leave
him
Then
last
began
weep
and
going
Frodo
composed
his
body
and
folded
his
cold
hands
upon
his
breast
and
wrapped
his
cloak
about
him
and
laid
his
own
sword
one
side
and
the
staff
that
Faramir
had
given
the
other
said
then
must
take
your
sword
your
leave
Frodo
but
put
this
one
lie
you
lay
the
old
king
the
barrow
and
you
got
your
beautiful
mithril
coat
from
old
Bilbo
And
your
star
glass
Frodo
you
did
lend
and
need
for
always
the
dark
now
too
good
for
and
the
Lady
gave
you
but
maybe
she
understand
_you_
understand
Frodo
got
But
could
not
not
yet
knelt
and
held
Frodo
hand
and
could
not
release
And
time
went
and
still
knelt
holding
his
master
hand
and
his
heart
keeping
debate
Now
tried
find
strength
tear
himself
away
and
lonely
journey
for
vengeance
once
could
his
anger
would
bear
him
down
all
the
roads
the
world
pursuing
until
had
him
last
Gollum
Then
Gollum
would
die
corner
But
that
was
not
what
had
set
out
would
not
worth
while
leave
his
master
for
that
would
not
bring
him
back
Nothing
would
They
had
better
both
dead
together
And
that
too
would
lonely
journey
looked
the
bright
point
the
sword
thought
the
places
behind
where
there
was
black
brink
and
empty
fall
into
nothingness
There
was
escape
that
way
That
was
nothing
not
even
grieve
That
was
not
what
had
set
out
What
then
cried
again
and
now
seemed
plainly
know
the
hard
answer
_see
through_
Another
lonely
journey
and
the
worst
What
alone
the
Crack
Doom
and
all
quailed
still
but
the
resolve
grew
What
_Me_
take
the
Ring
from
_him_
The
Council
gave
him
But
the
answer
came
once
And
the
Council
gave
him
companions
that
the
errand
should
not
fail
And
you
are
the
last
all
the
Company
The
errand
must
not
fail
wish
wasn
the
last
groaned
wish
old
Gandalf
was
hare
somebody
Why
left
all
alone
make
mind
sure
wrong
And
not
for
taking
the
Ring
putting
myself
forward
But
you
haven
put
yourself
forward
you
been
put
forward
And
for
not
being
the
right
and
proper
person
why
Frodo
wasn
you
might
say
nor
Bilbo
They
didn
choose
themselves
well
must
make
own
mind
will
make
But
sure
wrong
that
Sam
Gamgee
all
over
Let
see
now
found
here
Frodo
found
and
that
Thing
him
well
the
Enemy
will
get
And
that
the
end
all
Lorien
and
Rivendell
and
the
Shire
and
all
And
there
time
lose
the
end
anyway
The
war
begun
and
more
than
likely
things
are
all
going
the
Enemy
way
already
chance
back
with
and
get
advice
permission
sit
here
till
they
come
and
kill
over
master
body
and
gets
take
and
drew
deep
breath
Then
take
stooped
Very
gently
undid
the
clasp
the
neck
and
slipped
his
hand
inside
Frodo
tunic
then
with
his
other
hand
raising
the
head
kissed
the
cold
forehead
and
softly
drew
the
chain
over
And
then
the
head
lay
quietly
back
again
rest
change
came
over
the
still
face
and
that
more
than
all
other
tokens
Sam
was
convinced
last
that
Frodo
had
died
and
laid
aside
the
Quest
Good
bye
master
dear
murmured
Forgive
your
Sam
come
back
this
spot
when
the
job
done
manages
And
then
not
leave
you
again
Rest
you
quiet
till
come
and
may
foul
creature
come
anigh
you
And
the
Lady
could
hear
and
give
one
wish
would
wish
come
back
and
find
you
again
Good
bye
And
then
bent
his
own
neck
and
put
the
chain
upon
and
once
his
head
was
bowed
the
ground
with
the
weight
the
Ring
great
stone
had
been
strung
him
But
slowly
the
weight
became
less
new
strength
grew
him
raised
his
head
and
then
with
great
effort
got
his
feet
and
found
that
could
walk
and
bear
his
burden
And
for
moment
lifted
the
Phial
and
looked
down
his
master
and
the
light
burned
gently
now
with
the
soft
radiance
the
evening
star
summer
and
that
light
Frodo
face
was
fair
hue
again
pale
but
beautiful
with
elvish
beauty
one
who
has
long
passed
the
shadows
And
with
the
bitter
comfort
that
last
sight
Sam
turned
and
hid
the
light
and
stumbled
into
the
growing
dark
had
not
far
The
tunnel
was
some
way
behind
the
Cleft
couple
hundred
yards
ahead
less
The
path
was
visible
the
dusk
deep
rut
worn
ages
passage
running
now
gently
long
trough
with
cliffs
either
side
The
trough
narrowed
rapidly
Soon
Sam
came
long
flight
broad
shallow
steps
Now
the
orc
tower
was
right
above
him
frowning
black
and
the
red
eye
glowed
Now
was
hidden
the
dark
shadow
under
was
coming
the
top
the
steps
and
was
the
Cleft
last
made
mind
kept
saying
himself
But
had
not
Though
had
done
his
best
think
out
what
was
doing
was
altogether
against
the
grain
his
nature
Have
got
wrong
muttered
What
ought
have
done
the
sheer
sides
the
Cleft
closed
about
him
before
reached
the
actual
summit
before
looked
last
the
path
descending
into
the
Nameless
Land
turned
For
moment
motionless
intolerable
doubt
looked
back
could
still
see
like
small
blot
the
gathering
gloom
the
mouth
the
tunnel
and
thought
could
see
guess
where
Frodo
lay
fancied
there
was
glimmer
the
ground
down
there
perhaps
was
some
trick
his
tears
peered
out
that
high
stony
place
where
all
his
life
had
fallen
ruin
only
could
have
wish
one
wish
sighed
back
and
find
him
Then
last
turned
the
road
front
and
took
few
steps
the
heaviest
and
the
most
reluctant
had
ever
taken
Only
few
steps
and
now
only
few
more
and
would
going
down
and
would
never
see
that
high
place
again
And
then
suddenly
heard
cries
and
voices
stood
still
stone
Orc
voices
They
were
behind
him
and
before
him
noise
tramping
feet
and
harsh
shouts
Orcs
were
coming
the
Cleft
from
the
far
side
from
some
entry
the
tower
perhaps
Tramping
feet
and
shouts
behind
wheeled
round
saw
small
red
lights
torches
winking
away
below
there
they
issued
from
the
tunnel
last
the
hunt
was
The
red
eye
the
tower
had
not
been
blind
was
caught
Now
the
flicker
approaching
torches
and
the
clink
steel
ahead
was
very
near
minute
they
would
reach
the
top
and
him
had
taken
too
long
making
his
mind
and
now
was
good
How
could
escape
save
himself
save
the
Ring
The
Ring
was
not
aware
any
thought
decision
simply
found
himself
drawing
out
the
chain
and
taking
the
Ring
his
hand
The
head
the
orc
company
appeared
the
Cleft
right
before
him
Then
put
The
world
changed
and
single
moment
time
was
filled
with
hour
thought
once
was
aware
that
hearing
was
sharpened
while
sight
was
dimmed
but
otherwise
than
Shelob
lair
All
things
about
him
now
were
not
dark
but
vague
while
himself
was
there
grey
hazy
world
alone
like
small
black
solid
rock
and
the
Ring
weighing
down
his
left
hand
was
like
orb
hot
gold
did
not
feel
invisible
all
but
horribly
and
uniquely
visible
and
knew
that
somewhere
Eye
was
searching
for
him
heard
the
crack
stone
and
the
murmur
water
far
off
Morgul
Vale
and
down
away
under
the
rock
the
bubbling
misery
Shelob
groping
lost
some
blind
passage
and
voices
the
dungeons
the
tower
and
the
cries
the
Orcs
they
came
out
the
tunnel
and
deafening
roaring
his
ears
the
crash
the
feet
and
the
rending
clamour
the
Orcs
before
him
shrank
against
the
cliff
But
they
marched
like
phantom
company
grey
distorted
figures
mist
only
dreams
fear
with
pale
flames
their
hands
And
they
passed
him
cowered
trying
creep
away
into
some
cranny
and
hide
listened
The
Orcs
from
the
tunnel
and
the
others
marching
down
had
sighted
one
another
and
both
parties
were
now
hurrying
and
shouting
heard
them
both
clearly
and
understood
what
they
said
Perhaps
the
Ring
gave
understanding
tongues
simply
understanding
especially
the
servants
Sauron
its
maker
that
gave
heed
understood
and
translated
the
thought
himself
Certainly
the
Ring
had
grown
greatly
power
approached
the
places
its
forging
but
one
thing
did
not
confer
and
that
was
courage
present
Sam
still
thought
only
hiding
lying
low
till
all
was
quiet
again
and
listened
anxiously
could
not
tell
how
near
the
voices
were
the
words
seemed
almost
his
ears
Hola
Gorbag
What
are
you
doing
here
Had
enough
war
already
Orders
you
lubber
And
what
are
you
doing
Shagrat
Tired
lurking
there
Thinking
coming
down
fight
Orders
you
command
this
pass
speak
civil
What
your
report
Nothing
Hai
hai
yoi
yell
broke
into
the
exchanges
the
leaders
The
Orcs
lower
down
had
suddenly
seen
something
They
began
run
did
the
others
Hai
Hola
Here
something
Lying
right
the
road
spy
spy
There
was
hoot
snarling
horns
and
babel
baying
voices
With
dreadful
stroke
Sam
was
wakened
from
his
cowering
mood
They
had
seen
his
master
What
would
they
had
heard
tales
the
Orcs
make
the
blood
run
cold
could
not
borne
sprang
flung
the
Quest
and
all
his
decisions
away
and
fear
and
doubt
with
them
knew
now
where
his
place
was
and
had
been
his
master
side
though
what
could
there
was
not
clear
Back
ran
down
the
steps
down
the
path
towards
Frodo
How
many
are
there
thought
Thirty
forty
from
the
tower
least
and
lot
more
than
that
from
down
below
guess
How
many
can
kill
before
they
get
They
see
the
flame
the
sword
soon
draw
and
they
get
sooner
later
wonder
any
song
will
ever
mention
How
Samwise
fell
the
High
Pass
and
made
wall
bodies
round
his
master
song
course
not
for
the
Ring
found
and
there
more
songs
can
help
place
Frodo
They
must
understand
that
Elrond
and
the
Council
and
the
great
Lords
and
Ladies
with
all
their
wisdom
Their
plans
have
gone
wrong
can
their
Ring
bearer
Not
without
Frodo
But
the
Orcs
were
out
his
dim
sight
now
had
had
time
consider
himself
but
now
realized
that
was
weary
weary
almost
exhaustion
his
legs
would
not
carry
him
wished
was
too
slow
The
path
seemed
miles
long
Where
had
they
all
got
the
mist
There
they
were
again
good
way
ahead
still
cluster
figures
round
something
lying
the
ground
few
seemed
darting
this
way
and
that
bent
like
dogs
trail
tried
make
spurt
Come
Sam
said
you
too
late
again
loosened
the
sword
its
sheath
minute
would
draw
and
then
There
was
wild
clamour
hooting
and
laughing
something
was
lifted
from
the
ground
hoi
harri
hoi
Then
voice
shouted
Now
off
The
quick
way
Back
the
Undergate
She
not
trouble
tonight
all
the
signs
The
whole
band
orc
figures
began
move
Four
the
middle
were
carrying
body
high
their
shoulders
hoi
They
had
taken
Frodo
body
They
were
off
could
not
catch
them
Still
laboured
The
Orcs
reached
the
tunnel
and
were
passing
Those
with
the
burden
went
first
and
behind
them
there
was
good
deal
struggling
and
jostling
Sam
came
drew
the
sword
flicker
blue
his
wavering
hand
but
they
did
not
see
Even
came
panting
the
last
them
vanished
into
the
black
hole
For
moment
stood
gasping
clutching
his
breast
Then
drew
his
sleeve
across
his
face
wiping
away
the
grime
and
sweat
and
tears
Curse
the
filth
said
and
sprang
after
them
into
the
darkness
longer
seemed
very
dark
him
the
tunnel
rather
was
had
stepped
out
thin
mist
into
heavier
fog
His
weariness
was
growing
but
his
will
hardened
all
the
more
thought
could
see
the
light
torches
little
way
ahead
but
try
would
could
not
catch
them
Orcs
fast
tunnels
and
this
tunnel
they
knew
well
for
spite
Shelob
they
were
forced
use
often
the
swiftest
way
from
the
Dead
City
over
the
mountains
what
far
off
time
the
main
tunnel
and
the
great
round
pit
had
been
made
where
Shelob
had
taken
her
abode
ages
past
they
did
not
know
but
many
byways
they
had
themselves
delved
about
either
side
escape
the
lair
their
goings
and
fro
the
business
their
masters
Tonight
they
did
not
intend
far
down
but
were
hastening
find
side
passage
that
led
back
their
watch
tower
the
cliff
Must
them
were
gleeful
delighted
with
what
they
had
found
and
seen
and
they
ran
they
gabbled
and
yammered
after
the
fashion
their
kind
Sam
heard
the
noise
their
harsh
voices
flat
and
hard
the
dead
air
and
could
distinguish
two
voices
from
among
all
the
rest
they
were
louder
and
nearer
him
The
captains
the
two
parties
seemed
bringing
the
rear
debating
they
went
Can
you
stop
your
rabble
making
such
racket
Shagrat
grunted
the
one
don
want
Shelob
Gorbag
Yours
are
making
more
than
half
the
noise
said
the
other
But
let
the
lads
play
need
worry
about
Shelob
for
bit
reckon
She
sat
nail
seems
and
shan
cry
about
that
Didn
you
see
nasty
mess
all
the
way
back
that
cursed
crack
hers
stopped
once
stopped
hundred
times
let
laugh
And
struck
bit
luck
last
got
something
that
Lugbúrz
wants
Lugbúrz
wants
What
you
think
Elvish
looked
but
undersized
What
the
danger
thing
like
that
Don
know
till
had
look
Oho
they
haven
told
you
what
expect
They
don
tell
all
they
know
they
Not
half
But
they
can
make
mistakes
even
the
Top
Ones
can
Gorbag
Shagrat
voice
was
lowered
that
even
with
his
strangely
sharpened
hearing
Sam
could
only
just
catch
what
was
said
They
may
but
they
got
eyes
and
ears
everywhere
some
among
lot
like
not
But
there
doubt
about
they
troubled
about
something
The
Nazgûl
down
below
are
your
account
and
Lugbúrz
too
Something
nearly
slipped
Nearly
you
say
said
Gorbag
All
right
said
Shagrat
but
talk
that
later
Wait
till
get
the
Under
way
There
place
there
where
can
talk
bit
while
the
lads
Shortly
afterwards
Sam
saw
the
torches
disappear
Then
there
was
rumbling
noise
and
just
hurried
bump
far
could
guess
the
Orcs
had
turned
and
gone
into
the
very
opening
which
Frodo
and
had
tried
and
found
blocked
was
still
blocked
There
seemed
great
stone
the
way
but
the
Orcs
had
got
through
somehow
for
could
hear
their
voices
the
other
side
They
were
still
running
along
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
mountain
back
towards
the
tower
Sam
felt
desperate
They
were
carrying
off
his
master
body
for
some
foul
purpose
and
could
not
follow
thrust
and
pushed
the
block
and
threw
himself
against
but
did
not
yield
Then
not
far
inside
thought
heard
the
two
captains
voices
talking
again
stood
still
listening
for
little
hoping
perhaps
learn
something
useful
Perhaps
Gorbag
who
seemed
belong
Minas
Morgul
would
come
out
and
could
then
slip
don
know
said
Gorbag
voice
The
messages
through
quicker
than
anything
could
fly
rule
But
don
enquire
how
done
Safest
not
Grr
Those
Nazgûl
give
the
creeps
And
they
skin
the
body
off
you
soon
look
you
and
leave
you
all
cold
the
dark
the
other
side
But
likes
they
His
favourites
nowadays
use
grumbling
tell
you
game
serving
down
the
city
You
should
try
being
here
with
Shelob
for
company
said
Shagrat
like
try
somewhere
where
there
none
But
the
war
now
and
when
that
over
things
may
easier
going
well
they
say
They
would
grunted
Gorbag
see
But
anyway
does
well
there
should
lot
more
room
What
you
say
get
chance
you
and
slip
off
and
set
somewhere
our
own
with
few
trusty
lads
somewhere
where
there
good
loot
nice
and
handy
and
big
bosses
said
Shagrat
Like
old
times
Yes
said
Gorbag
But
don
count
not
easy
mind
said
the
Big
Bosses
his
voice
sank
almost
whisper
even
the
Biggest
can
make
mistakes
Something
nearly
slipped
you
say
say
something
_has_
slipped
And
got
look
out
Always
the
poor
Uruks
put
slips
right
and
small
thanks
But
don
forget
the
enemies
don
love
any
more
than
they
love
Him
and
they
get
topsides
Him
done
too
But
see
here
when
were
you
ordered
out
About
hour
ago
just
before
you
saw
message
came
_Nazgûl
uneasy
Spies
feared
Stairs
Double
vigilance
Patrol
head
Stairs_
came
once
Bad
business
said
Gorbag
See
here
our
Silent
Watchers
were
uneasy
more
than
two
days
ago
that
know
But
patrol
wasn
ordered
out
for
another
day
nor
any
message
sent
Lugbúrz
either
owing
the
Great
Signal
going
and
the
High
Nazgûl
going
off
the
war
and
all
that
And
then
they
couldn
get
Lugbúrz
pay
attention
for
good
while
told
The
Eye
was
busy
elsewhere
suppose
said
Shagrat
Big
things
going
away
west
they
say
daresay
growled
Gorbag
But
the
meantime
enemies
have
got
the
Stairs
And
what
were
you
You
supposed
keep
watch
aren
you
special
orders
What
are
you
for
That
enough
Don
try
and
teach
job
were
awake
all
right
knew
there
were
funny
things
going
Very
funny
Yes
very
funny
lights
and
shouting
and
all
But
Shelob
was
the
lads
saw
her
and
her
Sneak
Her
Sneak
What
that
You
must
have
seen
him
little
thin
black
fellow
like
spider
himself
perhaps
more
like
starved
frog
been
here
before
Came
_out_
Lugbúrz
the
first
time
years
ago
and
had
word
from
High
let
him
pass
been
the
Stairs
once
twice
since
then
but
left
him
alone
seems
have
some
understanding
with
Her
Ladyship
suppose
good
eat
she
wouldn
worry
about
words
from
High
But
fine
guard
you
keep
the
valley
was
here
day
before
all
this
racket
Early
last
night
saw
him
Anyway
lads
reported
that
Her
Ladyship
was
having
some
fun
and
that
seemed
good
enough
for
until
the
message
came
thought
her
Sneak
had
brought
her
toy
that
you
perhaps
sent
her
present
prisoner
war
something
don
interfere
when
she
playing
Nothing
gets
Shelob
when
she
the
hunt
Nothing
say
you
Didn
you
use
your
eyes
back
there
tell
you
not
easy
mind
Whatever
came
the
Stairs
_did_
get
cut
her
web
and
got
clean
out
the
hole
That
something
think
about
well
but
she
got
him
the
end
didn
she
_Got_
him
Got
_who_
This
little
fellow
But
was
the
only
one
then
she
have
had
him
off
her
larder
long
before
and
there
now
And
Lugbúrz
wanted
him
_you
have
and
get
him
Nice
for
you
But
there
was
more
than
one
this
point
Sam
began
listen
more
attentively
and
pressed
his
ear
against
the
stone
Who
cut
the
cords
she
put
round
him
Shagrat
Same
one
cut
the
web
Didn
you
see
that
And
who
stuck
pin
into
Her
Ladyship
Same
one
reckon
And
where
Where
Shagrat
Shagrat
made
reply
You
may
well
put
your
thinking
cap
you
got
one
laughing
matter
one
one
has
ever
stuck
pin
Shelob
before
you
should
know
well
enough
There
grief
that
but
think
there
someone
loose
hereabouts
more
dangerous
than
any
other
damned
rebel
that
ever
walked
since
the
bad
old
times
since
the
Great
Siege
Something
_has_
slipped
And
what
then
growled
Shagrat
all
the
signs
Captain
Shagrat
say
there
large
warrior
loose
Elf
most
likely
with
elf
sword
anyway
and
axe
well
maybe
and
loose
your
bounds
too
and
you
never
spotted
him
Very
funny
indeed
Gorbag
spat
Sam
smiled
grimly
this
description
himself
well
you
always
did
take
gloomy
view
said
Shagrat
You
can
read
the
signs
how
you
like
but
there
may
other
ways
explain
them
Anyhow
got
watchers
every
point
and
going
deal
with
one
thing
time
When
had
look
the
fellow
_have_
caught
then
begin
worry
about
something
else
guess
you
won
find
much
that
little
fellow
said
Gorbag
may
have
had
nothing
with
the
real
mischief
The
big
fellow
with
the
sharp
sword
doesn
seem
have
thought
him
worth
much
anyhow
just
left
him
lying
regular
elvish
trick
see
Come
now
talked
enough
Let
and
have
look
the
prisoner
What
are
you
going
with
him
Don
forget
spotted
him
first
there
any
game
and
lads
must
Now
now
growled
Shagrat
have
orders
And
more
than
belly
worth
yours
break
_Any_
trespasser
found
the
guard
held
the
tower
Prisoner
stripped
Full
description
every
article
garment
weapon
letter
ring
trinket
sent
Lugbúrz
once
and
Lugbúrz
_only_
And
the
prisoner
kept
safe
and
intact
under
pain
death
for
every
member
the
guard
until
sends
comes
Himself
That
plain
enough
and
that
what
going
Stripped
said
Gorbag
What
teeth
nails
hair
and
all
none
that
for
Lugbúrz
tell
you
wanted
safe
and
whole
You
find
that
difficult
laughed
Gorbag
nothing
but
carrion
now
What
Lugbúrz
will
with
such
stuff
can
guess
might
well
the
pot
You
fool
snarled
Shagrat
You
been
talking
very
clever
but
there
lot
you
don
know
though
most
other
folk
You
for
the
pot
for
Shelob
you
don
take
care
Carrion
that
all
you
know
Her
Ladyship
When
she
binds
with
cords
she
after
meat
She
doesn
eat
dead
meat
nor
suck
cold
blood
This
fellow
isn
dead
Sam
reeled
clutching
the
stone
felt
the
whole
dark
world
was
turning
upside
down
great
was
the
shock
that
almost
swooned
but
even
fought
keep
hold
his
senses
deep
inside
him
was
aware
the
comment
You
fool
isn
dead
and
your
heart
knew
Don
trust
your
head
Samwise
not
the
best
part
you
The
trouble
with
you
that
you
never
really
had
any
hope
Now
what
done
Fur
the
moment
nothing
but
prop
himself
against
the
unmoving
stone
and
listen
listen
the
vile
orc
voices
Garn
said
Shagrat
She
got
more
than
one
poison
When
she
hunting
she
just
gives
dab
the
neck
and
they
limp
boned
fish
and
then
she
has
her
way
with
them
you
remember
old
Ufthak
lost
him
for
days
Then
found
him
corner
hanging
was
but
was
wide
awake
and
glaring
How
laughed
She
forgotten
him
maybe
but
didn
touch
him
good
interfering
with
Her
Nar
this
little
filth
wake
few
hours
and
beyond
feeling
bit
sick
for
hit
all
right
would
Lugbúrz
would
let
him
alone
And
course
beyond
wondering
where
and
what
happened
him
And
what
going
happen
him
laughed
Gorbag
can
tell
him
few
stories
any
rate
can
anything
else
don
suppose
ever
been
lovely
Lugbúrz
may
like
know
what
expect
This
going
more
funny
than
thought
Let
There
going
fun
tell
you
said
Shagrat
And
got
kept
safe
all
good
dead
AII
right
But
were
you
catch
the
big
one
that
loose
before
you
send
any
report
Lugbúrz
won
sound
too
pretty
say
you
caught
the
kitten
and
let
the
cat
escape
The
voices
began
move
away
Sam
heard
the
sound
feet
receding
was
recovering
from
his
shock
and
now
wild
fury
was
him
got
all
wrong
cried
knew
would
Now
they
got
him
the
devils
the
filth
Never
leave
your
master
never
never
that
was
right
rule
And
knew
heart
May
forgiven
Now
got
get
back
him
Somehow
somehow
drew
his
sword
again
and
beat
the
stone
with
the
hilt
but
only
gave
out
dull
sound
The
sword
however
blazed
brightly
now
that
could
see
dimly
its
light
his
surprise
noticed
that
the
great
block
was
shaped
like
heavy
door
and
was
less
than
twice
his
own
height
Above
was
dark
blank
space
between
the
top
and
the
low
arch
the
opening
was
probably
only
meant
stop
against
the
intrusion
Shelob
fastened
the
inside
with
some
latch
bolt
beyond
the
reach
her
cunning
With
his
remaining
strength
Sam
leaped
and
caught
the
top
scrambled
and
dropped
and
then
ran
madly
sword
blazing
hand
round
bend
and
winding
tunnel
The
news
that
his
master
was
still
alive
roused
him
last
effort
beyond
thought
weariness
could
not
see
anything
ahead
for
this
new
passage
twisted
and
turned
constantly
but
thought
was
catching
the
two
Orcs
their
voices
were
growing
nearer
again
Now
they
seemed
quite
close
That
what
going
said
Shagrat
angry
tones
Put
him
right
the
top
chamber
What
for
growled
Gorbag
Haven
you
any
lock
ups
down
below
going
out
harm
way
tell
you
answered
Shagrat
See
precious
don
trust
all
lads
and
none
yours
nor
you
neither
when
you
mad
for
fun
going
where
want
him
and
where
you
won
come
you
don
keep
civil
the
top
say
safe
there
Will
said
Sam
You
forgetting
the
great
big
elvish
warrior
that
loose
And
with
that
raced
round
the
last
corner
only
find
that
some
trick
the
tunnel
the
hearing
which
the
Ring
gave
him
had
misjudged
the
distance
The
two
orc
figures
were
still
some
way
ahead
could
see
them
now
black
and
squat
against
red
glare
The
passage
ran
straight
last
incline
and
the
end
wide
open
were
great
double
doors
leading
probably
deep
chambers
far
below
the
high
horn
the
tower
Already
the
Orcs
with
their
burden
had
passed
inside
Gorbag
and
Shagrat
were
drawing
near
the
gate
Sam
heard
burst
hoarse
singing
blaring
horns
and
banging
gongs
hideous
clamour
Gorbag
and
Shagrat
were
already
the
threshold
Sam
yelled
and
brandished
Sting
but
his
little
voice
was
drowned
the
tumult
one
heeded
him
The
great
doors
slammed
Boom
The
bars
iron
fell
into
place
inside
Clang
The
gate
was
shut
Sam
hurled
himself
against
the
bolted
brazen
plates
and
fell
senseless
the
ground
was
out
the
darkness
Frodo
was
alive
but
taken
the
Enemy
Here
ends
the
second
part
the
history
the
War
the
Ring
The
third
part
tells
the
last
defence
against
the
Shadow
and
the
end
the
mission
the
Ring
bearer
THE
RETURN
THE
KING
