Should

Chiefly
the

Once

CAESAR
more
than

Might

Yet
you

Did

Might
question
ANTONY
How
intend
you
practis
CAESAR
You
may
pleas
catch
mine
intent
what
did
here
befall
Your
wife
and
brother
Made
wars
upon
and
their
contestation
Was
theme
for
you
you
were
the
word
war
ANTONY
You
mistake
your
business
brother
never
Did
urge
his
act
did
inquire
And
have
learning
from
some
true
reports
That
drew
their
swords
with
you
Did
not
rather
Discredit
authority
with
yours
And
make
the
wars
alike
against
stomach
Having
alike
your
cause
this
letters
Before
did
satisfy
you
you
patch
quarrel
matter
whole
you
have
not
make
with
must
not
with
this
CAESAR
You
praise
yourself
laying
defects
judgment
but
You
patch
your
excuses
ANTONY
Not
not
know
you
could
not
lack
certain
Very
necessity
this
thought
that
Your
partner
the
cause
gainst
which
fought
Could
not
with
graceful
eyes
attend
those
wars
Which
fronted
mine
own
peace
for
wife
would
you
had
her
spirit
such
another
The
third
world
yours
which
with
snaffle
You
may
pace
easy
but
not
such
wife
ENOBARBUS
Would
had
all
such
wives
that
the
men
might
wars
with
the
women
ANTONY
much
uncurbable
her
garboils
Caesar
Made
out
her
impatience
which
not
wanted
Shrewdness
policy
too
grieving
grant
Did
you
too
much
disquiet
For
that
you
must
But
say
could
not
help
CAESAR
wrote
you
When
rioting
Alexandria
you
Did
pocket
letters
and
with
taunts
Did
gibe
missive
out
audience
ANTONY
Sir
fell
upon
ere
admitted
Then
Three
kings
had
newly
feasted
and
did
want
what
was
morning
but
next
day
told
him
myself
which
was
much
have
ask
him
pardon
Let
this
fellow
nothing
our
strife
contend
Out
our
question
wipe
him
CAESAR
You
have
broken
The
article
your
oath
which
you
shall
never
Have
tongue
charge
with
LEPIDUS
Soft
Caesar
ANTONY
Lepidus
let
him
speak
The

Supposing

But

The

Neglected

And

From

That
from

Did
come

indeed
lord
The
wretched
animal
heav
forth
such
groans
That
their
discharge
did
stretch
his
leathern
coat
Almost
bursting
and
the
big
round
tears
Cours

into

Poor

giving
thy
sum
more
that
which
had
too
much
Then
being
there
alone
Left
and
abandoned
his
velvet
friends
Tis
right
quoth
thus
misery
doth
part
The
flux
company
Anon
careless
herd
Full
the
pasture
jumps
along
him
And
never
stays
greet
him
quoth
Jaques
Sweep
you
fat
and
greasy
citizens
Tis
just
the
fashion
Wherefore
you
look
Upon
that
poor
and
broken
bankrupt
there
Thus
most
invectively
pierceth
through
The
body
the
country
city
court
Yea
and
this

swearing

Are
mere
usurpers
tyrants

That

Who
shut

Should

Scratch

Some

The

Thy

His

There

When

Within
hour
and
pacing
through
the
forest
Chewing
the
food
sweet
and
bitter
fancy
what
befell
threw
his
eye
aside
And
mark
what
object
did
present
itself
Under
oak
whose
boughs
were
moss
with
age
And
high
top
bald
with
dry
antiquity
wretched
ragged
man
ergrown
with
hair
Lay
sleeping
his
back
About
his
neck
green
and
gilded
snake
had
wreath
itself
Who
with
her
head
nimble
threats
approach
The
opening
his
mouth
but
suddenly
Seeing
Orlando
unlink
itself
And
with
indented
glides
did
slip
away
Into
bush
under
which
bush
shade
lioness
with
udders
all
drawn
dry
Lay
couching
head
ground
with
catlike
watch
When
that
the
sleeping
man
should
stir
for
tis
The
royal
disposition
that
beast
prey
nothing
that
doth
seem
dead
This
seen
Orlando
did
approach
the
man
And
found
was
his
brother
his
elder
brother
CELIA
have
heard
him
speak
that
same
brother
And
did
render
him
the
most
unnatural
That
liv
amongst

OLIVER
And
well
might
For
well
know
was
unnatural
ROSALIND
But
Orlando
did
leave
him
there
Food
the
suck
and
hungry
lioness
OLIVER
Twice
did
turn
his
back
and
purpos
But
kindness
nobler
ever
than
revenge
And
nature
stronger
than
his
just
occasion
Made
him
give
battle
the
lioness
Who
quickly
fell
before
him
which

From
miserable
slumber

Three
they
say

tis
thought
every

Coriolanus
will
carry
FIRST
OFFICER
That
brave
fellow
but
vengeance
proud
and
loves
not
the

people
SECOND
OFFICER
Faith
there
have
been
many
great
men
that
have
flatter
the
people
who
loved
them
and
there
many
that
they
have
loved
they
know
not
wherefore
that
they
love
they
know
not
why
they
hate
upon
better
ground
Therefore
for
Coriolanus
neither
care
whether
they
love
hate
him
manifests
the
true
knowledge
has
their
disposition
and
out
his
noble
carelessness
lets
them
plainly
see
FIRST
OFFICER
did
not
care
whether
had
their
love
waved
indifferently
twixt
doing
them
neither
good
nor
harm
but
seeks
their
hate
with
greater
devotion
than
they
can
render
him
and
leaves
nothing
undone
that
may
fully
discover
him
their
opposite
Now
seem
affect
the
malice
and
displeasure
the
people
bad
that
which
dislikes
flatter
them
for
their

SECOND

silent
